                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This is a single source command directive for CAA aircrews flying additional
and supplemental aircraft. Additional and supplemental aircraft are defined in AFSOC
Instruction (AFSOCI) 11219, Vol 1, Additional/Supplemental Aircraft Training. Use this
instruction and the applicable aircraft specific addenda in conjunction with Aircraft Flight
Manual (AFM) or equivalent flight manual, Flight Information Publications (FLIP), and
applicable United States Air Force (USAF) directives. HQ AFSOC/A3V has overall
responsibility for administration of this instruction.
1.2. Applicability. This publication     applies   to   all   CAA    aircrew   members     flying
additional/supplemental aircraft.
1.3. Terms Explained.
   1.3.1. "Will" and "shall," indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. "Should," indicates a recommended procedure that is required if practical.
   1.3.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. Warning: Operating procedures, techniques, and so forth, which may result in
   personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.
   1.3.5. Caution: Operating procedures, techniques, and so forth, which may result in damage
   to equipment if not carefully followed.
   1.3.6. Note: Operating procedures, techniques, and so forth, which are essential to
   emphasize.
   1.3.7. An additional aircraft, for the purposes of this instruction, is defined as an AFSOC
   owned or leased aircraft, not part of the enduring USAF inventory, maintained and flown for
   the purposes of CAA aircrew qualification and/or certification.
   1.3.8. A supplemental aircraft, for the purposes of this instruction, is defined as an aircraft
   which are not typically owned or leased by the USAF, and typically used for less than 6
   months for the purpose of aviation advisory operations and training.
1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this instruction,
unless safety dictates otherwise.
   1.4.1. Although this publication provides guidance for aircraft operations under most
   circumstances, it is not a substitute for sound judgment. When it is necessary to protect the
   crew and aircraft from a situation not covered by this instruction and immediate action is
   required, the aircraft commander (AC) has ultimate authority and responsibility for the
   course of action to be taken. Report deviations, without waiver, through channels to HQ
   AFSOC/A3 within 48 hours, followed by a written report, if requested.
   1.4.2. Unless otherwise indicated, the HQ AFSOC/A3, HQ AFRC/A3 for ARC units, is the
   waiver authority for this instruction. For operationally assigned forces, the waiver authority
   is the Commander, Air Force Special Operation Forces (COMAFSOF). Request waivers
   through command and control channels. (T-2).
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 11


   1.4.3. Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk.
       1.4.3.1. “Tier 0” (T-0) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance is
       determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority.
       1.4.3.2. “Tier 1” (T-1) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
       may put airman, mission, or program strongly at risk, and may only be waived by the
       MAJCOM/CC or delegate with concurrence of publication approver. When multiple
       MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate.
       1.4.3.3. “Tier 2” (T-2) requirements are reserved for requirements that potentially put
       the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission or program, and may only be
       waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate.
       1.4.3.4. “Tier 3” (T-3) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
       has a remote risk of mission failure, and may be waived by the Wing/CC but no lower
       than the OG/CC.
1.5. Supplements. Aircraft specific operating instructions will be published as addenda to this
instruction. Additionally, units may publish local procedures as a supplement to Chapter 10 of
this volume. The purpose of the unit supplement is to document the process by which units
implement the requirements of this instruction. File supplements according to AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management.
1.6. Requisitioning Procedures. This publication will be provided in electronic form by the
OPR. Ensure each CAA crew member who is designated to fly an additional/supplemental
aircraft receives the applicable chapters of this publication.
1.7. Revisions. Personnel at all echelons are encouraged to submit proposed changes IAW
AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program, through Stan/Eval channels to HQ AFSOC/A3V. Use AF
Form 847.
1.8. Format. In order to adequately provide guidance to all CAA operations without restricting
the overall mission, general procedures are discussed first in Chapter 1 through Chapter 6.
Chapter 7 through Chapter 9 detail fixed-wing procedures. Chapter 10 describes local
operating procedures. Chapter 11 through Chapter 13 detail additional aircrew procedures.
Addenda will be added to this instruction to address aircraft specific procedures and guidance.
These addenda will remain as part of the regulation even after those aircraft are no longer flown
to provide historical reference for future requirements. Again there is no substitute for sound
judgment and the absence of guidance in this publication does not constitute approval for
operations that fall outside the realm of safe and sound decisions.
1.9. Use of Nonstandard Publications. Submit all flight publications, aircraft specific addenda
to this instruction, and appropriate checklists, either the manufacturer’s or unit generated, to
HQ AFSOC/A3V for review and HQ AFSOC/A3 for approval prior to flight use by aircrew
other than any initial cadre. Expanded checklists will be published as part of the addenda to this
instruction. Abbreviated checklists (CL) will be published separately as “CLs”.
1.10. Roles and Responsibilities. AFI 11-202, Vol 3, outlines responsibilities for aircrew
operations. The HQ AFSOC/A3 and HQ AFRC/A3 share responsibility for the management of
units utilizing this regulation. Waiver authorities can be found in Paragraph 1.4 and throughout
this regulation. Chapter 2 of this publication further defines roles and responsibilities.

                                            Chapter 2

                                COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The aircraft commander or mission commander will ensure proper military flight
following through timely reporting to the appropriate command and control (C2) authority.
2.2. Mission Commander (MC). A MC will be designated when more than one aircraft or
crew is deployed away from home station for training, exercises, or other operations. The MC
should be a field grade officer. In the case of CAA Operational Aviation Detachments (OADs),
follow the guidance in AFSOCI 16-101, Vol 3, Combat Aviation Advisory Operations. The
mission commander should not be a primary crew member for exercises, but may fly as a crew
member on non-exercise missions. Mission commander duties, or AC duties when mission
commander not required, include, but are not limited to:
   2.2.1. Briefing crews on local operating procedures.
   2.2.2. Coordinating with Air Traffic Control (ATC), Special Tactics Squadron (STS), range
   control, users, and others that may have an impact on the mission.
   2.2.3. Ensuring that drop zone (DZ) and or landing zones (LZ) have a current survey (when
   necessary).
   2.2.4. Ensuring personnel have ample and adequate billeting, messing, and transportation
   arrangements.
   2.2.5. Ensuring maintenance personnel know of aircraft status, configuration and fuel
   requirements.
   2.2.6. Flight reporting IAW Paragraph 2.1.
2.3. Aircraft Commander Responsibility and Authority. An AC is designated for all flights
on the AF Form 4327A, Crew Flight (FA) Authorization. Aircraft commanders are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Responsible for the welfare of their crew and safe mission accomplishment.
   2.3.3. Vested with the authority necessary to manage their crew and accomplish the mission.
   2.3.4. The final mission authority and will make decisions not specifically assigned to a
   higher authority.
   2.3.5. The final authority for accepting a waiver affecting their crew or mission.
   2.3.6. Charged with keeping the commander informed of mission progress and difficulties.
   2.3.7. Responsible for flight reporting in the absence of a mission commander.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay a mission may be made either by
the agency with operational control (OPCON) or the aircraft commander when, in the opinion of
either, conditions are not safe to start or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe
conduct of the mission rests with the AC. If the AC refuses a mission, it will not depart until the
conditions have been corrected or improved so that the mission can operate safely. Another AC
and aircrew will not be alerted to take the same mission under the same conditions.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                13


  2.4.1. Diverting or rerouting a mission must be authorized by the commander with OPCON,
  except in an emergency or when required by en route or terminal weather conditions or
  facilities. In the event of an emergency or weather related divert or reroute, the mission or
  aircraft commander must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible.
     2.4.1.1. The controlling agency directing the rerouting or diversion is responsible for
     ensuring the aircraft is compatible with destination requirements and facilities.
     2.4.1.2. The aircraft commander will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or
     aircrew limitations that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.
  2.4.2. When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the controlling agency will ensure
  the aircraft commander is provided existing and forecasted weather for the alternate. If the
  planned alternate is unsuitable upon arrival at destination, the controlling agency will advise
  the AC of other suitable alternates.

                       CREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Qualification. Personnel assigned as a primary crew member, or occupying a
primary crew position during flight, must be qualified (or certified for non-USAF supplemental
aircraft) or in training for qualification/certification in that crew position and mission. (T-2)
   3.1.1. Basic qualified/certified crew members may perform primary crew duties on tactical
   missions when receiving tactical mission qualification training or evaluations from a
   qualified instructor or flight examiner in their respective crew position.
   3.1.2. Noncurrent (NC) or unqualified (UNQ) crew members may perform crew duties only
   on designated training or evaluation missions under the supervision of a qualified instructor
   or flight examiner in their respective crew position. Current and qualified pilots will occupy
   pilot positions when passengers are on board IAW AFI 11-401, Flight Management.
3.2. Crew Complement. Minimum crew complement is as prescribed in the AFM or
equivalent and the aircraft specific addendum to this instruction. The operations group
commander (OG/CC) or equivalent is the waiver authority for all crew positions below the
minimum specified by the flight manual. The unit commander (or Sq/DO for AFRC units
without a full time squadron commander) may add crew members to enhance mission
accomplishment or maximize training. A loadmaster (LM) is always required for any airdrop
mission in which actual loads will depart the aircraft. (T-3)
3.3. Interfly. The wing/group commander is the approval authority for interfly on aircraft under
their control. In all cases, the crew will be qualified in the aircraft mission design series (MDS).
(T-3)
3.4. Scheduling Restrictions. IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules.
3.5. Crew Rest. IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.
   3.5.1. The crew chief is responsible to the AC. The AC will determine how long the crew
   chief can safely perform aircraft recovery actions. The crew chief must have the opportunity
   to sleep 8 hours of each 24-hour period.
3.6. Flight Duty Period (FDP). IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.

                                          Chapter 4

                         COMMAND OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. Objective and Policy. The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission
rests with the aircraft commander. If one AC accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission
segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that AC, or a different AC,
to subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative.
4.2. Operating Guidelines.
   4.2.1. For aircraft without a minimum equipment list (MEL), comply with Federal Aviation
   Regulations and Aeronautical Information Manual (FAR/AIM), Part 91.205, Instrument and
   Equipment Requirements, and Part 91.213, Inoperative Instruments and Equipment. The
   aircraft commander determines whether the inoperative instrument or equipment constitutes a
   hazard to the aircraft or not and is the approval authority for operations with degraded
   equipment within the guidelines of these FAR/AIMs. Operating outside of Part 91.205
   guidelines requires Group Commander approval. (T-3)
   4.2.2. For aircraft with an MEL, it is the operating guideline. It lists the equipment and
   systems considered essential for routine operations and provides guidance on how to operate
   with degraded equipment. The AC is the approval authority for operations with degraded
   equipment within the guidelines of the MEL and needs no further approval. Operating
   outside of MEL guidelines requires OG/CC approval. Tactical and airdrop missions fall
   outside the scope of FAR/AIM compliant MELs. ACs will ensure that equipment necessary
   for the mission being flown is operational. (T-3)
   4.2.3. For aircraft with MELs issued by multiple countries, comply with the MEL of the air
   worthiness certificate issuing authority.
 16                                                     AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


                                            Chapter 5

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

5.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security, inflight and on the ground.
Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist an aircraft hijacking. Resistance may vary
from dissuasion to direct physical confrontation, including the use of weapons. Due to the
sensitive nature of anti-hijacking procedures, crew members should reference AFI 13-207,
Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (FOUO), and the Flight Information Handbook (FIH)
for specific guidance. Aircrews will not release any information concerning those procedures or
hijacking attempts.
5.2. Security. IAW AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense IC #2, AFSOC aircraft are Protection
Level (PL) "3" and 4 resources. This security priority designation applies to operational aircraft,
wherever they are located, worldwide. Some aircraft contain equipment and documents that
require protection per DOD 5200.01, DOD Information Security Program, Volumes 1-4, and
AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.
5.3. Procedures. The planning agency must ensure adequate en route force protection is
available. The amount of force protection required will vary, depending on location, threat, and
ground time. Mission Commanders will receive an aircraft security recommendation from their
local threat working group based on current intelligence reporting and local/regional threat status
using the aircraft security recommendation matrix IAW AFSOCI 31-100, Special Operations
Security Forces Deployment Planning and Operations. Tailored security measures at deployed
locations must be approved by the mission commander and the respective air operations center
(AOC) must be notified as soon as possible. During both emergency and unscheduled landings
at unplanned airfields, the MC or AC will assess the security situation and take the following
actions: (Note: If the aircrew is not capable of providing adequate security, the MC or AC will
request/coordinate security through available channels and notify the respective AOC as soon as
possible.)
   5.3.1. Area Patrol/Security Response Team (SRT). Request area patrol/SRT coverage from
   local security forces to include backup response forces commensurate with PL 3
   requirements specified in AFI 31-101. If local authorities request payment for this service,
   use AF Form 15, USAF Invoice.
   5.3.2. Aircrew Surveillance. Direct armed personnel to remain with the aircraft and
   maintain surveillance over aircraft entrances and activities in the vicinity of the aircraft.
   Obtain a means to report suspicious or hostile activity to security forces (e.g., land mobile
   radio, etc.).
   5.3.3. Departure without Crew Rest. If local security forces are unacceptable or unavailable
   and the crew is not augmented with security forces, the AC may waive FDP restrictions and
   depart as soon as possible for a destination with adequate force protection. If unable to
   depart the location due to system malfunction, coordinate through home station channels to
   acquire force protection support.
   5.3.4. Unauthorized Entry. If, in the ACs judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked and
   sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry:
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 17


       5.3.4.1. Use the aircraft lock. (Note: The aircraft will be locked during all off-station
       missions remaining overnight).
       5.3.4.2. If the aircraft lock is unavailable, secure the hatches and doors in a manner that
       will indicate unauthorized entry. For example, tape inside hatch release handles to the
       airframe, so that entry pulls the tape loose; close and seal the doors or using a metal
       boxcar seal or other controllable device to identify forced entry; wipe the immediate area
       around the seal clean to help investigate forced entry. If the seals are damaged or have
       been tampered with, notify the appropriate local authorities, the controlling agency, and
       inspect the aircraft thoroughly.
       5.3.4.3. Coordinate with the local base operations representative on procedures for
       servicing the aircraft while the crew is away. If a padlock is used, the key or combination
       will be left with base operations or the representative for servicing and maintenance
       personnel.
5.4. Protective Standards for Aircraft Carrying Distinguished Visitors (DV). This
paragraph applies specifically to aircraft transporting DVs Code 4 or above. ACs are responsible
for aircraft security at en route stops.
   5.4.1. DOD Installations. Notify the base security forces of estimated arrival and departure
   times. Request continuous security surveillance during the entire ground time. If the
   installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available.
   5.4.2. Non-DOD Installations. Contact the airport manager or installation commander to
   arrange for force protection. If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security
   using AF Form 15, USAF Invoice.
5.5. Arming of Crew Members. When directed, at least one crew member each from the flight
deck and cargo compartment will carry weapons. Follow arming requirements of AFI 31117,
Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel.
   5.5.1. Issue. Before departing home station, authorized crew members will obtain weapons,
   ammunition, lock, and key. Crew members must present a current AF Form 523, USAF
   Authorization to Bear Firearms, to be issued a weapon. Crew members will be reissued the
   same weapon until the mission terminates at home station. If an armed crew member must
   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member, using AF
   Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   5.5.2. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling
   Manual, outlines safety requirements for personnel arming and weapons handling. Load and
   unload weapons at approved clearing barrels if available. To transfer a loaded weapon to
   another crew member, place the weapon on a flat surface. Do not use a hand-to-hand
   transfer.
   5.5.3. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect the
   identity of armed crew members. Do not wear weapons off the flightline, except to and from
   the armory, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities such as base operations,
   fleet service, cargo or passenger terminals, flightline cafeterias, snack bars, etc. However,
   local threat assessments and deployment planning factors may dictate more stringent arming
   requirements.
 18                                                     AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


   5.5.4. Weapons Storage Inflight. Crew members will be armed before beginning pre-flight
   or onload duties. When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check,
   weapons may be stored in a gun box (if equipped) inflight. Crew members will rearm before
   landing. Weapons need not be unloaded before being placed in the gun box.
   5.5.5. Crew Rest. During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure facility available,
   normally the base armory. If a weapons storage facility is unavailable or the country
   prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box.
   5.5.6. Aircraft without a Gun Box. If an aircraft without a gun box must remain overnight at
   a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the nearest
   acceptable facility. Acceptable storage facilities are US or Allied military services armories
   US National Guard and Reserve armories, and US civil law enforcement armories. If none
   of these are available, or the AC believes weapons security may be compromised, crew
   members may secure their weapons in their quarters, but one crew member must remain with
   the weapons at all times. In this case, turn the ammunition over to the AC.
5.6. General Hijacking Guidance. The hijacking of an AFSOC aircraft could create a serious
international incident and jeopardize the safety of passengers and property. An aircraft is most
vulnerable when the crew is on board and the aircraft is ready for flight. Hijackers cannot be
dealt with as ordinary criminals. Some are mentally disturbed, emotionally unstable individuals
for whom the threat of death is not a deterrent, but a stimulus to crime. Delay tactics have been
most successful in saving lives and property. Crews must resist all attempts to hijack their
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple discouragement to direct physical attack with
weapons. Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the
problem.
   5.6.1. Acceptance of Passengers. The host station passenger processing and manifesting
   facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers unless the AC is
   fully satisfied with these inspections. Exception: Supporting/supported forces may be anti-
   hijack inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew.
   5.6.2. Aeromedical Procedures. Military medical facility commanders are responsible for
   the anti-hijacking inspection of patients. When patients are delivered to the aircraft by
   civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections before departure.
   5.6.3. Contingency and exercise movements. During contingencies in support of combat
   operations involving the movement of large numbers of personnel and exercises, the
   supported unit should manifest passengers and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   5.6.4. Arms and Ammunition. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their
   person or in hand-carried baggage on board an aircraft except special agents and guards of
   the Secret Service or State Department, and other individuals specifically authorized to carry
   weapons.
       5.6.4.1. Take every precaution to prevent accidental discharge of weapons.                 If
       individuals must clear their weapons, ask them to:
           5.6.4.1.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
           personnel before unholstering or unslinging their weapons.
           5.6.4.1.2. Clear their weapons IAW standard safety procedure.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                             19


       5.6.4.2. Troops and deadhead crew members will not retain custody of ammunition on an
       aircraft but will turn it in to the troop commander or AC. Troops may carry unloaded
       weapons and ammunition on board the aircraft during combat operations. When the
       situation dictates, weapons may be loaded at the order of the troop commander or team
       leader.
5.7. Specific Hijacking Guidance. It is imperative that all crew members are familiar with the
ground and inflight resistance actions, covert communications, and forced penetration of
unfriendly airspace procedures in AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy
(FOUO), and the FIH. In the event of a hijacking, crew members must act immediately and
resourcefully, without instruction, in order to counter the attacker successfully.

       6.2.1.1. Personal oxygen masks are required for all missions involving any pre-
       breathing.
       6.2.1.2. The LM and any other personnel required to be mobile in the cargo compartment
       will wear helmets during aerial deliveries utilizing an overhead aircraft anchor cable.
   6.2.2. Eye Protection. Use protective goggles, plastic lens glasses, or the helmet visor for
   eye protection if the duties require personnel to be in close proximity to an open exit.
   6.2.3. Rafts. Ensure sufficient life rafts are on board to accommodate all passengers and
   aircrew members on overwater flights. Life rafts are not required when overwater flight
   occurs only for short distances, immediately after takeoff and before landing.
   6.2.4. Life Preservers:
       6.2.4.1. Life preservers will be sized and available at the crew member's station while
       overwater. Wear life preservers whenever below 2,000 feet overwater (except takeoff
       and landing). For overwater missions carrying children and/or infants, ensure appropriate
       number and type of life preservers are aboard.
   6.2.5. Anti-Exposure Suits:
       6.2.5.1. Anti-exposure suits will be available during overwater flights when the route of
       flight is beyond power-off gliding distance from land and the water temperature is 60° F
       or below.
       6.2.5.2. If the water temperature ranges between 51° F and 60° F, the unit or mission
       commander may waive or extend the anti-exposure suit requirement after carefully
       considering the following factors:
          6.2.5.2.1. Climate zone and existing weather throughout range of flights.
          6.2.5.2.2. Operational requirements.
          6.2.5.2.3. Number and type of aircraft in formation.
          6.2.5.2.4. Time of flight overwater.

          6.2.5.2.6. Location, availability, and capability of search and rescue (SAR) forces,
          (consider anticipated time in the water prior to pick-up).
          6.2.5.2.7. Winds and wave height and their impact on SAR.
          6.2.5.2.8. Altitude and distance from land.
       6.2.5.3. Anti-exposure suits are not required when only the approach or departure is
       flown overwater.
   6.2.6. Restraining Device. Crew members will wear a restraining device when near open
   doors or hatches inflight.
6.3. Personal and Professional Equipment. Crew members will carry or wear personal and
professional equipment as follows:
   6.3.1. Identification Tags. Mission requirements permitting, identification tags should be
   worn around the neck unless such wear creates a hazard. They may be carried in the flight
   suit pocket during missions requiring the wearing of a parachute or restraining harness.
   6.3.2. Rings. Do not wear finger rings, earrings or other loose fitting jewelry while in, on, or
   around aircraft.
   6.3.3. Glasses. Wear prescribed glasses or contact lenses as required by AFI 11-202.
   6.3.4. Restricted Area Badges. Carry the restricted area badge when directed. Display the
   badge only in designated restricted areas.

       deployment support, FAA representatives, STS, and other military personnel who are on
       board to communicate/coordinate with other agencies. Off-station travel is documented
       by travel orders. Local flights will be documented by letter of authorization from the
       OG/CC (Exception: Squadron commanders may approve squadron assigned personnel).
       When frequent local flights are necessary, commanders may issue annual authorizations
       by name or Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) as appropriate. When using this option,
       aircraft commanders will ensure that all restrictions in the following paragraph are
       complied with for each individual mission. Supporting forces must be properly
       manifested. (T-3)
           6.20.5.2.1. Restrictions. Pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI 11-
           401. Simulated EPs are prohibited (Exception: EPs required for the purposes of a
           functional check flight or FAA flight evaluation are authorized. In this context,
           personnel on board are required for mission accomplishment. Limit personnel to
           absolute minimum required). Other mission events are authorized. Aircraft
           commanders will ensure that supporting forces are briefed on the mission profile and
           mission events before flight.

Section 6B—PREFLIGHT

6.21. Flight and Maintenance Log. Review the aircraft maintenance forms before applying
power to the aircraft or operating aircraft systems. Ensure that the USAF Fuel Identaplate and/or
contract fuel card is aboard the aircraft and applicable preflight is documented before flight.
6.22. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.22.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in refueling may perform refueling
   duties at austere locations or at stations without maintenance support.
   6.22.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Simultaneous aircraft refueling or defueling and
   cargo loading or maintenance operations are authorized IAW TO 00-25-172, Ground
   Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bounding. Refueling or defueling with
   passengers or patients aboard is authorized only for aero medical evacuation missions IAW
   TO 00-25-172.
   6.22.3. Fire Protection. An aircraft engine fire extinguisher system or cabin fire extinguisher
   fulfills the minimum requirements for fire protection during engine start. However, a
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    27


   portable fire extinguisher, if available, should be positioned outside of the wing tip for added
   fire protection.
   6.22.4. Towing.
       6.22.4.1. At military installations, the AC will coordinate with the senior maintenance
       officer or superintendent to ensure the towing supervisor and crew are qualified. If
       aircrew members are required to participate in towing operations, any qualified crew
       member may perform cockpit duties. All crew members may act as wing walkers.
       6.22.4.2. At non-military installations, the AC should coordinate towing requirements
       with the local Fixed Base Operator (FBO). The AC should ensure the tow team
       supervisor is qualified to tow the aircraft and all personnel involved in the operation are
       briefed on their specific duties. If the AC is satisfied the FBO and tow team supervisor is
       qualified, crew members do not have to be involved in the towing operation.
6.23. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Documentation. The AC or designated representative
will:
   6.23.1. Prior to departing home station, ensure appropriate serviceable protective clothing,
   aircrew flight, survival, and dash 21 equipment for the entire mission is aboard the aircraft.
   6.23.2. Prior to departing home station and following en route crew changes, review the
   aircrew flight equipment list to ensure required equipment is on board and required
   inspections have been completed.
   6.23.3. Aircrew members discovering AFE missing will make an entry in the aircraft
   maintenance records.
6.24. Transponder Operations. Aircraft will not depart with an inoperative transponder.
Mission requirements will dictate the use of Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) (if equipped) and
aircraft commanders should comply with the appropriate operational order (OPORD) or special
instructions (SPINS).
Exception: Aircraft may takeoff if the transponder was operational on the previous leg, if the
transponder is inoperative at a location where no repair capability exits, and both the unit
operations officer and ATC approve the flight. Pilots will comply with all airspace limitations
regarding flight without a transponder.
6.25. Cargo Documentation.
   6.25.1. Proper cargo documentation will accompany each load. The cargo manifest with
   accompanying DD Form 1384, Transportation Control and Movement Document (TCMD)
   (interpreted punch card deck or manual form), and special handling documents, as
   applicable, will be delivered to the aircraft before departure. The manifest will be one of the
   following:
   6.25.2. Computer printed product.
   6.25.3. The 80/80 (off-line manifest) listing.
   6.25.4. DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest.
   6.25.5. DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, will accompany the manifest if
   required.

6.26. Dropped Object Prevention. During aircraft exterior visual inspections, pay particular
attention to surfaces, panels, and components, which potentially could be dropped objects. If a
dropped object is discovered and the mission is continued, the flight crew will:
   6.26.1. Ensure a write up is entered in the aircraft flight and maintenance log.
   6.26.2. Notify the operations center as soon as practical. Ensure a write-up is documented in
   the AFTO Form 781A.
6.27. Narcotics. Crew members will ensure narcotics and other unauthorized items are not
smuggled aboard the aircraft.
6.28. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects. The flight deck area will be kept as uncluttered
and orderly as possible for all flight and ground operations. Specifically:
   6.28.1. During engine start and ground operations, no items (checklist, charts, etc.) are
   placed to prevent inspection of aircraft instruments, engine gauges, or switches.
   6.28.2. During flight, no items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be placed in a position that
   covers or hides any gauges.
   6.28.3. Publication kits, flight kits, and personal items will not be placed where they may
   interfere with the flight controls or egress.

Section 6C—DEPARTURE

6.29. Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD). An appropriately qualified crew member will
complete TOLD IAW the aircraft Information Manual, Pilot's Operating Handbook or FAA
approved Airplane Manual, or Aircraft Operations Manual. A qualified crew member, if
available, will crosscheck the TOLD for accuracy using the flight manual, approved tabulated
data, or approved computer TOLD application. Tabulated distance data will not be used for the
first tactical/Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) takeoff or landing.
   6.29.1. Crosscheck minimum control, takeoff and landing speeds. If operating multi-engine
   aircraft in high density altitude, compute stall speed and compare with the minimum control
   speed. This will be done for the initial takeoff, landing, and for significant changes in
   operating conditions.
   6.29.2. When performance is critical (e.g., short field operations, high density altitudes, etc.),
   a pilot will crosscheck distances, ground roll, engine out climb performance, and engine out
   cruise ceilings.
6.30. Power Application. To help prevent over-temperatures, crew members will monitor
engine parameters (Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT), Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT), Inter-
Turbine Temperature (ITT), etc.) as throttles are advanced or collective is applied. Crew
members should announce when power or temperature limits are reached, whichever occurs first.
For tactical operations, power checks should be performed prior to initial departure.
6.31. Departure Monitoring. Additional crew members not flying the aircraft will back up the
pilot and report any deviations from the planned departure. When radar facilities are available,
departures will be radar monitored to the maximum extent possible.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   29



Section 6D—EN ROUTE

6.32. Oxygen Requirements. IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules.
6.33. Flight Progress. Use all available navigational aids to maintain course centerline and
positive fixing of the aircraft's position. Report malfunctions or loss of navigation capability,
which degrades centerline accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control center (ARTCC)
immediately.
6.34. Intelligence Sightings and Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from
aircraft as indicated in the local or deployed instructions.
6.35. Inflight Meals. The AC and copilot will not consume inflight meals within 1 1/2 hours of
each other during flight if the meals were procured from the same vendor and consist of the same
menu.
6.36. Communications.
   6.36.1. All communications will be IAW FLIP or as directed by the controlling agency.
   Required frequencies will be provided by the controlling authority in the Communications
   Element Operation Instructions (CEOI).
   6.36.2. If at all possible, the number of air-to-air and air-to-ground nets should be limited to
   and compatible with the radios installed on the aircraft. If this is not possible the controlling
   authority will designate which aircraft will operate on a specific net. If it is not designated,
   the highest priority nets will be monitored with subsequent nets to be monitored on a time
   and communications system availability basis.
6.37. Inflight Emergency Procedures. Report deviations of directives that occur because of an
emergency IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.
6.38. Continued Flight with Engine Failure (Multi-Engine Aircraft). The flight will
terminate at the nearest facility, which in the judgment of the aircraft commander offers safe and
favorable operating conditions. Crews should consider suitable diversion fields along their route
of flight during preflight planning.
6.39. Fuel Jettisoning. Fuel will not be jettisoned except during combat conditions, emergency
conditions, or rescue missions requiring gross weight reduction.
6.40. Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care, the AC will
inform the next station of intended landing (if possible) in sufficient time so medical personnel
may meet the aircraft. The request will include the sex, approximate age, and the nature of the
medical problem.
6.41. Weather Forecasts.
   6.41.1. The primary contact for inflight weather assistance is the Pilot Meteorological
   Service (PMSV). Another source is Flight Watch on 122.0 if the en route altitude is between
   5,000 MSL and 17,500. For flights conducted at FL180 and above, refer to the back page of
   the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Airfield Facility Directory
   (AFD), (Green book) for a discrete frequency. Be advised that continental US (CONUS) En
 30                                                      AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


   Route Flight Advisory Service (EFAS) services are normally available between 0600L-
   2200L. If outside these hours contact the nearest flight service station (FSS).
   6.41.2. Aircrews will make every attempt to obtain latest weather prior to descent for
   landing at the destination.
6.42. Low-Level Overwater Operations. The accumulation of salt spray on windshields and
side windows is a factor, which must be considered for low-level overwater flight. Salt deposits
on windows will restrict visibility, possibly jeopardizing flying safety. Weigh the above factors
against mission urgency prior to descent below 500 feet, when heavy seas or high surface winds
exist. In some cases, it will be preferable to fly at a higher altitude to avoid this hazard.

Section 6E—ARRIVAL

6.43. Crew Coordination. On two pilot aircraft, the pilot flying the approach will brief the
crew on the descent, approach, and landing IAW applicable briefing guides and addendums. The
nonflying pilot will monitor the approach and report any deviations from prescribed procedures.
Crew members will confine their activities to appropriate aircraft operation.
6.44. Instrument Approach Minimums. IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, and AFMAN 11-217,
Vol 1.
   6.44.1. Flight Instrumentation. Full flight instrumentation for all approaches includes
   barometric altimeters, airspeed indicators, vertical velocity indicators, heading indicators,
   and attitude indicators, in the pilot and, if installed, copilot positions. For global positioning
   system (GPS) approaches, predictive receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) must
   be operational and checked for the arrival airfield prior to commencing the approach.
       6.44.1.1. For ILS, full flight instrumentation also includes dual flight displays if
       installed.
       6.44.1.2. The ability to copy the flying pilot's information to the nonflying pilot's side
       satisfies the requirement.
       6.44.1.3. If full flight instrumentation is not available and operational, base decision
       height (DH) or minimum descent altitude (MDA) on a minimum height above threshold
       (HAT) or height above airfield (HAA) of 300 feet and runway visual range (RVR) 40, or
       visibility 3/4 mile if RVR is not available.
   6.44.2. Precision Radar. Visibility will be no lower than RVR 24 or 1/2 mile if RVR is not
   available. DH will be based on an HAT of no less than 200 feet.
6.45. Weather Below Minimums. If the reported ceiling is below the minimum for the
approach, but the visibility value is at or above the authorized minimums before initiating an en
route descent or penetration and approach, pilots may attempt the approach provided fuel
remaining is sufficient to accomplish the en route descent or penetration, approach, missed
approach, and flight to alternate with appropriate reserves.
   6.45.1. An AC may hold at a destination with weather below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to or above minimums, provided:
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   31


       6.45.1.1. Fuel remaining is more than required to hold for the appropriate holding time
       and fly to the alternate with appropriate reserves, and weather for the alternate is forecast
       to remain at or above alternate minimums for the period, including holding time.
       6.45.1.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before the excess
       fuel will be consumed.
   6.45.2. If advised that the weather is below landing minimums after starting an en route
   descent or approach, aircrews may elect to either continue the approach and land or execute a
   divert/missed approach.
6.46. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.46.1. Fly instrument approaches to maintain proficiency and to positively identify arrival
   airports. Aircraft equipped with TSO C-129a or TSO C-146 (WAAS) GPS equipment
   approved for IFR navigation and approaches are authorized to fly GPS approaches IAW AFI
   11-202, Vol 3, and AFMAN11-217, Vol 1. Contact/visual approaches are authorized to
   maintain visual landing proficiency. Use radar monitoring when feasible.
   6.46.2. Pilots will fly a precision approach, if available, at night or during marginal weather
   in order to positively identify arrival airfields. On training or evaluation flights, pilots may
   fly non-precision approaches or VFR traffic patterns at night. Use radar monitoring when
   feasible. NVGs may be worn during both operational and training instrument approaches
   during night.
   6.46.3. When flying a coupled approach, assume manual control at or above published
   MDA/DH or IAW aircraft AFM/POH, if higher.
6.47. Advisory Calls. Mandatory advisory calls for the pilot not flying the aircraft are as
follows:
   6.47.1. Non-precision approaches:
       6.47.1.1. One hundred feet above minimum altitudes.
       6.47.1.2. "Minimums" at MDA.
       6.47.1.3. "Runway in sight." Called when sufficient visual reference with the runway
       environment (IAW AFMAN 11-217, Vol 1) is established and the aircraft is in a safe
       position to land.
       6.47.1.4. "Go-around." Called at the missed approach point when visual reference with
       the runway environment is insufficient to continue the approach or any time the approach
       becomes unsafe.
   6.47.2. Precision approaches:
       6.47.2.1. One hundred feet above DH.
       6.47.2.2. "Continue." Call at DH if only the approach light system is in sight and a
       determination cannot yet be made that the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing. If an
       approach is continued below DH based on seeing the approach lights only (an approach
       to visibility minimums), "go-around" must be called by 100 feet if a determination to
       land cannot be made.
 32                                                    AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


       6.47.2.3. "Land." Call at DH or later if runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is
       in a position for a normal landing.
       6.47.2.4. "Go-around." Call at DH or later if the runway environment is not in sight or if
       the aircraft is not in a position for a safe landing. If an approach is continued below DH
       based on seeing the approach lights only (an approach to visibility minimums), "go-
       around" must be called by 100 feet if a determination to land cannot be made.
   6.47.3. Climb out:
       6.47.3.1. Transition altitude.
       6.47.3.2. One thousand feet below assigned altitude.
   6.47.4. Descent:
       6.47.4.1. Transition level.
       6.47.4.2. One thousand feet above assigned altitude.
       6.47.4.3. One thousand feet above initial approach fix altitude or holding altitude.
       6.47.4.4. One hundred feet above procedure turn and final approach fix altitude.
6.48. Radar Altimeter Procedures. If equipped, set the radar altimeters IAW the flight manual
or to an altitude that provides the most appropriate altitude warning for the approach being
flown. Pilots will crosscheck radar altimeters during descent to ensure adequate terrain clearance
is provided throughout the descent and maneuvering portion of the approach. Once established
in a VFR traffic pattern, the radar altimeter may be set at pilot's discretion.
6.49. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Pilots must exercise the discipline necessary to ensure
wake turbulence avoidance criteria are observed during flight operations. Acceptance of a visual
or contact approach clearance or instructions to follow an aircraft is acknowledgment that the
pilot will maintain a safe interval for wake turbulence avoidance. The following instructions
expand wake turbulence avoidance criteria, but do not replace guidance in FLIP, General
Planning and the FAR/AIM.
   6.49.1. AFSOC light fixed wing aircraft will maintain two minute spacing behind small
   aircraft and three minutes behind large and heavy aircraft. This requirement does not apply
   between like or smaller aircraft.

Section 6F—POSTFLIGHT

6.50. Classified Material.
   6.50.1. Turn in authenticators and other classified materials at destination, and obtain
   receipts for classified material. Command posts will provide temporary storage for
   authenticators and classified materials during ground time at en route stops. Issue and turn-in
   of authenticators normally is a function of base operations. At locations where no storage
   facilities exist, the AC will ensure classified material is properly protected.
   6.50.2. Remove any classified information in the Flight Management System (FMS),
   Internal Navigation System (INS), Area Navigation (R-NAV), or GPS.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                33


   6.50.3. In an emergency destroy or damage classified material and equipment prior to crash
   landing or bailout if possible.
6.51. Impoundment. If an aircraft is involved in a serious incident, which in the judgment of
the AC places the airworthiness of the aircraft into question, the AC will impound the aircraft
immediately after landing and contact the controlling agency for further instructions.

Section 6G—DEBRIEFING

6.52. Maintenance. The AC is responsible for ensuring aircraft maintenance forms are correct.
He may designate another crew member to accomplish maintenance form completion.
   6.52.1. Fixed-wing only: Enter "aircraft subjected to salt spray" on the aircraft maintenance
   forms any time the aircraft is flown under 1,000 feet above water level (AWL) over salt
   water, excluding takeoffs and landings.
   6.52.2. The AC and other pertinent crew members will debrief maintenance personnel on the
   conditions of the aircraft, engines, avionics equipment, and installed special equipment
   immediately after arrival. At stations where no maintenance support is available, provide a
   thorough debrief to the appropriate command and control agency prior to entering crew rest.
   6.52.3. When the aircraft will remain overnight (RON) off station, if the aircraft lands less
   than A-1, ACs should additionally report the status to home station maintenance, to include
   faxing a debrief sheet and copy of AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document, if requested.
6.53. Weather. The AC or a representative will pass significant information to the appropriate
weather unit.
6.54. Intelligence. Debrief intelligence when applicable.
6.55. Crew Debriefing. The AC will allow each crew member the opportunity to discuss
unusual aspects of the mission. Debriefings may be formal or informal. The appropriate forms
will be completed and available for review by the commander or operations officer as soon as
practical after mission completion.
6.56. Aircrew Notification Procedures. When transiting installations, the AC will establish a
point of contact with base operations or local airport manager when crew-resting off base. The
AC will be notified immediately in case of incident or emergency affecting the safety or security
of the aircraft.

Section 6H—MISCELLANEOUS PROCEDURES

6.57. Hazardous Material Procedures. The term "hazardous material" includes any material,
which, because of its quantity, properties, or packaging, may endanger human life or property.
Procedures in this paragraph apply whenever aircraft carry DOD Hazard Class or Division 1.1,
1.2, 1.3 explosives, DOT Class A and B poisons, etiological or biological research materials,
radioactive materials requiring yellow III labels, and inert devices. Also included are DOD
Hazard Class or Division 1.4 explosives, oxidizers, compressed gases, flammable solids and
liquids, and corrosive liquids listed in Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 24-204, Preparing
 34                                                      AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


Hazardous Material for Military Air Shipment when any of these are shipped in quantities of
1,000 pounds or more (gross weight).
   6.57.1. Briefing. Ensure the entire crew is briefed completely on the type and quantity of
   hazardous material, and complete a risk assessment.
   6.57.2. Cargo Documentation.      Do not accept hazardous materials unless proper
   documentation, certification, and identification of cargo are provided. This includes
   Transportation Control Number (TCN) entered correctly on both the cargo manifest and the
   DD Form 1387-2, Special Handling Data/Certification.
   6.57.3. Flight Planning. The AC (unless specifically briefed otherwise):
       6.57.3.1. Enters "Hazardous Cargo" and the mission number in the appropriate section of
       the flight plan. (Use remarks section of DD Form 175, Flight Plan, Military).

       areas.
       6.57.3.3. Prepares a departure message. The remarks section of the departure message
       should include the following information:
          6.57.3.3.1. DOT class and DOD Hazard class or division, if applicable, of hazardous
          material on board. (Include net weight of DOT Class A or B poisons and net
          explosive weight (NEW) of Class A or B explosives).
          6.57.3.3.2. Request for special support; e.g., isolated parking, security, technical
          escort teams, etc.
          6.57.3.3.3. Inert devices (when applicable).
          6.57.3.3.4. If Estimated Time En route (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other
          circumstances preclude timely receipt at destination, notify the base operations of first
          intended landing, by priority telephone, of the Estimated Time Arrival (ETA) and
          information listed in Paragraph 6.57.3.3.
   6.57.4. Before Engine Start. Ensure placards are removed. Give the controlling agency
   parking location, approximate engine start time, and verify that the fire-fighting agency has
   the hazardous materials information; otherwise, request the following be relayed to the fire-
   fighting agency:
       6.57.4.1. Department of Transportation (DOT) class of hazardous material aboard and
       the DOD hazard class or division for explosive material aboard.

   critical areas.
   6.57.6. Before Landing. Accomplish the following unless specifically prohibited by the
   theater commander or FLIP planning.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                               35


      6.57.6.1. Contact the base operations dispatcher, control tower, approach control, or
      other agency specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) before ETA to
      announce that "hazardous materials" are aboard and to verify that the appropriate base
      support agencies have received the departure message; otherwise, transmit the mission
      number, ETA, and information listed in Paragraph 6.57.3.3.
      6.57.6.2. If landing at a CONUS civil airport without a tower, give the above information
      to the nearest FAA flight service station.
      6.57.6.3. Request the information is relayed immediately to base operations or the civil
      airport manager, crash or fire protection agency, and other support activities.
   6.57.7. Parking:
      6.57.7.1. DOD requires aircraft carrying DOD Hazard Class or Division 1.1, 1.2,
      explosives, DOT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions are parked
      in areas isolated from personnel. ACs are responsible for ensuring cargo is correctly
      identified to the tower and ground control. When aircraft are not directed to an isolated
      area, identify the cargo again to tower or ground control. When identification is
      acknowledged, the host is solely responsible for selection the parking area. Should host
      procedures be questionable, submit trip reports or hazard reports, as appropriate, to
      document such occurrences.
      6.57.7.2. The military host is responsible for placarding aircraft. When missions operate
      on nonmilitary installations, the briefing to the AC will include placarding requirements
      and, if required, placards will be furnished at the onload base. The shipper must make
      prior arrangements with the airport manager for shipments of hazardous materials
      requiring placarding. The shipper is responsible for cargo identification, fire-fighting
      procedures, and isolated parking requirements.
   6.57.8. Unscheduled Landing Due to Inflight Emergency With Hazardous Materials.
   Transmit unclassified information to the appropriate air traffic control facility as follows:
      6.57.8.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
      6.57.8.2. Aircraft position and ETA.
      6.57.8.3. Number of personnel and location in aircraft.
      6.57.8.4. Fuel on board.
      6.57.8.5. That hazardous materials are aboard, location of the cargo, and applicable
      information listed in Paragraph 6.57.3.3.
   6.57.9. After Unscheduled Landing. Contact the appropriate C2 agency, giving arrival
   notice, hazardous materials information and other pertinent information as required.
6.58. Hazardous Medical Equipment.
   6.58.1. Nonstandard equipment possessed by medical facilities that use AFSOC air
   evacuation services should be viewed as potentially hazardous. Two types of equipment are
   of major concern:
 36                                                     AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


       6.58.1.1. Electronic medical equipment produces Electromagnetic Interference (EMI),
       which is commonly beyond the limits specified by MILSTD 461A and 462, and therefore
       can interfere with aircraft communication and navigation equipment.
       6.58.1.2. Therapeutic oxygen systems present an increased hazard of fire or explosion.
       A potential but real hazard is the inadvertent disruption of the cylinder neck, manifold, or
       regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories.
   6.58.2. Nonstandard electronic and oxygen equipment must be listed by manufacturer and
   model number in the current "Status Report on Medical Material Items Tested and Evaluated
   for use in the USAF Aeromedical Evacuation System, USAF School of Aerospace Medicine
   (USAFSAM), Wright-Patterson AFB”.
   6.58.3. For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions:
       6.58.3.1. Pararescue personnel must inform the aircraft commander when nonstandard
       electronic equipment is brought on board the aircraft.
       6.58.3.2. The AC must be informed of the anticipated period of use of the equipment
       during the mission.
       6.58.3.3. The AC must be alert for any interference with aircraft communication or
       navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment.
       6.58.3.4. When continuous use of the equipment is required throughout the duration of
       the mission, flight must be restricted to VFR conditions. Furthermore, exercise
       additional caution on night VFR missions to ensure there are no adverse effects on
       navigational equipment.
   6.58.4. For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions:
       6.58.4.1. All compressed oxygen equipment with exposed, unprotected cylinder neck,
       manifold, or regulators must be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal
       and lateral axis.
       6.58.4.2. Pararescue personnel must continually monitor the operation of the equipment
       to detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude.
6.59. Electronic Devices. The use of electronic devices is as specified in AFI 11-202, Vol 3. If
the aircrew detects any electronic interference from an electronic device used aboard the aircraft,
discontinue use of device for the duration of the flight.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  37

Foreign Clearance Guide and FLIP. Further aircraft specific addenda to this instruction must be
complied with.
7.2. Duty Station. A qualified pilot will be in control of the aircraft at all times during flight.
(Exception: Unqualified pilots undergoing qualification training and senior staff members with
an instructor pilot in the other seat). All crew members will be at their duty stations during all
takeoffs, departures, low-levels (below minimum safe altitude [MSA]), airdrops, approaches, and
landings. During other phases of flight, crew members may leave their duty stations to meet
physiological needs and perform normal crew duties. On aircraft with a flight engineer station
on the flight deck, do not allow both a pilot and the flight engineer to be absent from their duty
station at the same time. Notify the AC prior to departing assigned primary duty station.
7.3. Takeoff and Landing Policy.
   7.3.1. Except as provided in Paragraph 7.3.2, the pilot in command will occupy the seat
   designated by the AFM or equivalent.
       7.3.1.1. If no seat is designated in the above manuals, the pilot in command can occupy
       either seat provided he has access to a functioning set of flight controls and required
       flight instrumentation.
   7.3.2. Instructor and flight examiner pilots may perform takeoffs and landings from either
   seat under any condition providing that the aircraft is appropriately equipped.
   7.3.3. An AC qualified pilot will land from the AC designated seat during:

       7.9.1.2. Any crew member seeing a deviation of more than 200 feet from planned
       altitude, or deviations in heading, airspeed, or potential terrain or obstruction clearance
       problems will tell the pilot immediately.
       7.9.1.3. Do not discuss classified information on interphone during radio transmissions.
       7.9.1.4. Classified interphone or radio transmissions will be recorded on the cockpit
       voice recorder (CVR) if it is operating. Ensure any recorded classified conversations are
       removed.
       7.9.1.5. Non-aircrew members will monitor interphone or radio transmissions only when
       specifically approved by the AC. The AC will brief communications policy to these
       personnel prior to flight. The AC must ensure no one monitors classified information
       they are not cleared for, or transmits classified information over the radios.
   7.9.2. Command Radios:
       7.9.2.1. The pilot operating the radios will tell the crew which radio is primary. All crew
       members will monitor the primary radio unless specifically directed to do otherwise by
       the aircraft commander or other chapters of this instruction.
       7.9.2.2. One of the pilots or a designated crew member will monitor UHF or VHF
       "Guard" regardless of primary radio.

Section 7B—GENERAL AIRLAND PROCEDURES
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      39


7.10. Runway and Taxiway Requirements. In the absence of aircraft specific guidance
published as addenda to this regulation, minimum criteria for normal, contingency, and tactical
training operations are listed below. Multiple aircraft operations or other unusual circumstances
may dictate increased runway and taxiway requirements. Performance data must be computed
for all takeoffs and landings. All distances must be adjusted for unpaved, wet, soft, slushy, or icy
runways and runway slope.
   7.10.1. Normal Operations:
       7.10.1.1. Minimum runway length for takeoff is critical field length or balanced field
       length as appropriate for multi-engine aircraft. For single-engine aircraft, minimum
       runway length for takeoff is Accelerate/Stop distance if available or takeoff distance to
       50 feet. (T-3)
       7.10.1.2. Minimum runway length for landing is Normal Landing Distance from 50 feet,
       corrected for environmental conditions. If the aircraft manual does not contain this
       distance, then use landing ground roll distance plus 50% unless a distance is specified in
       the aircraft specific attachment. (T-3).
   7.10.2. Tactical Operations:
       7.10.2.1. Minimum runway length for takeoff is charted takeoff ground run plus 500
       feet. (T-3).
       7.10.2.2. Minimum runway length for landing is charted landing ground roll plus 500
       feet. (T-3).
WARNING: Do not use tabulated data for initial tactical takeoff and landing. Performance is
too critical for the approximations in tabulated data.
       7.10.2.3. LZs with minimum runway length may be simulated if a short LZ is not
       available. Coordinate with Combat Control Team/Landing Zone Safety Observer
       (CCT/LZSO) for desired markings.
   7.10.3. Minimum runway width for all operations is 200% of the distance from left main tire
   to right main tire unless specified otherwise in the aircraft specific addendum. (T-3)
   7.10.4. Minimum taxiway width for all operations is 150% of the distance from the left main
   tire to the right main tire. (T-3)
   7.10.5. Upon landing when runway remaining is not adequate for straight-ahead takeoff,
   assure a turnaround area is available.
7.11. Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria.
   7.11.1. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet, with wing walkers,
   by at least 10 feet.
   7.11.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use a wing walker. If wing walkers are unavailable,
   deplane a crew member to ensure obstruction clearance.
   7.11.3. When using reverse taxi (if equipped), avoid all obstructions by 25 feet. The aircraft
   should have a window or opening to allow a crew member to verbally direct the pilot and
   clear the rear of the aircraft. If visibility is not sufficient, the pilot will direct a crew member
   to exit the aircraft and direct the pilot from outside, using standard marshalling signals.

7.12. Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Criteria.
   7.12.1. The mission directive is confirmation that AFSOC has reviewed the airfields of
   intended operation for obstructions and other hazards IAW Air Force and AFSOC directives.
   AFSOC will advise crews of known obstructions and other factors that could be hazardous to
   air-land operations. ACs will not make an approach and landing into an airfield requiring
   certification by the HQ Air Mobility Command (AMC) Airfield Suitability Report, unless
   they have previously operated into that airfield as a pilot, copilot, or observer and have
   reviewed the airfield certification briefing and audiovisual program within the last 14 days or
   before departing home station, whichever is closer to the date of intended use.
   7.12.2. An LZ is suitable for operations when it meets the following obstacle clearance
   criteria in Table 7.1 and Table 7.2. The runway width requirements can be reduced in the
   aircraft specific attachments.

      7.12.2.1. Approach Zone. No obstructions higher than 1 foot for every 35 feet (35:1 or
      as appropriate for a specific aircraft) in the inner and outer zones as defined in AFI 13-
      217. See Table 7.2.
      7.12.2.2. Departure Zone. Base obstruction clearance requirements on predicted aircraft
      performance IAW the AFM and this instruction. For multi-engine aircraft, pilots will
      ensure the aircraft can clear obstacles and maintain the appropriate climb gradient with
      one engine inoperative.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 41


7.13. Reverse Taxi (If Applicable). Exercise extreme caution while backing an aircraft
because of the inherent hazards.
   7.13.1. The aircraft should have a window or opening to allow a crew member to verbally
   direct the pilot and clear the rear of the aircraft. In the absence of a ground handler, or if
   crew member visibility is not sufficient, the pilot will direct a crew member to exit the
   aircraft and direct the pilot from outside, using pre-briefed marshalling signals.
   7.13.2. Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated.
   7.13.3. Stop no less than 25 feet from an obstruction even if using a wing walker.
7.14. Inter. Normally, initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the runway. The decision to
make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the aircraft commander. Runway remaining must
meet the same length considerations as a normal takeoff.
7.15. Reduced Power Operations. To extend engine life, use reduced power procedures IAW
the AFM as much as possible during normal operations. During training when multiple touch-
and-go’s are being performed, takeoff power may be reduced IAW AFM or equivalent.
7.16. Engines Running Onload or Offload (ERO).
   7.16.1. The ERO procedures in this paragraph may be used for any mix of personnel or
   cargo.
   7.16.2. General Procedures:
      7.16.2.1. ACs will brief crew members on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing
      specific crew member duties.
      7.16.2.2. If applicable, cargo doors may be opened prior to parking to prepare for cargo
      offload or onload, provided all equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secured in the
      cargo compartment.
      7.16.2.3. The parking brake will normally be set, and one pilot will monitor brakes,
      interphone, and radio.
      7.16.2.4. Operate engines in ground idle/zero thrust. If conditions warrant, lower flaps to
      reduce prop blast aft of the aircraft. When operating free turbine propeller engines, pilots
      should consider feathering the propellers for the ERO.
      7.16.2.5. ACs should consider using any overt lighting that would assist the ERO and
      enhance safety.
      7.16.2.6. Complete passenger and cargo manifests, crew lists, and weight and balance for
      the subsequent sortie if passengers or cargo are onloaded or downloaded (unless to an
      empty aircraft).
      7.16.2.7. After the aircraft is slowed to taxi speed, the crew may remove all tie-downs
      except one forward and one aft restraint. Remove remaining restraints only after the
      aircraft is stopped and vehicle drivers are in place. Brief drivers not to release vehicle
      parking brakes until all restraint is removed and cleared by the crew. After clearance
      from the pilot is received (aircraft with a ramp and door), open the aft cargo door, lower
      the ramp to ground level, and clear off headset to direct onload or offload operations.

       7.16.2.8. The LM will direct all onloading or offloading operations using pre-briefed
       signals. Other qualified crew members may assist the operation; however, the crew LM
       retains overall responsibility for the operation.
       7.16.2.9. Passengers will be escorted by a crew member, if available, when enplaning or
       deplaning.
       7.16.2.10. Resume taxi when all crew members have verbally acknowledged that the
       aircraft is ready for taxiing.

Section 7C—AUSTERE LANDING ZONE OPERATIONS

7.17. General. Only fully mission qualified aircrews or those receiving instruction are
authorized to operate IAW this section. This section also applies to STOL operations. Use
normal takeoff and landing procedures whenever practical. If the AFM does not specifically
describe STOL procedures and operating limits, then use normal procedures modified by an
aircraft specific addendum. Do not violate AFM operating limitations on airspeeds or flap
configurations in order to increase aircraft performance.
7.18. Landing Zone Requirements.
   7.18.1. Coordinate for local Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) support. If local services are not
   available or practical, the Sq/CC (or Sq/DO for AFRC units without a full-time squadron
   commander) is responsible for determining if CFR support is necessary.
   7.18.2. In the absence of specific runway length criteria in the aircraft specific addendum:
       7.18.2.1. STOL Takeoff: Charted STOL accelerate-stop distance (+ 20% safety for
       training). (T-3)
       7.18.2.2. STOL Landing:       STOL Landing Ground Roll + 20% (+ 40% safety for
       training). (T-3)
       7.18.2.3. In all cases, runway width is limited to 150% of the wheel base (200% for
       training). (T-3)
   7.18.3. Runway width, length and surface type should be verified by an official source of
   airfield information, i.e. IFR Sup, VFR Sup, any FAA published airfield listing, sectional
   chart, en route chart, etc. In the absence of published data, a verbal confirmation with a
   person recently familiar with the airfield (eyes on the runway less than 30 days previously)
   may be a suitable substitute with unit operations officer approval.
7.19. Landing Zone Assessment. Mission operations may necessitate changes. Carefully
evaluate aircraft capabilities and the mission environment before the operation. ACs will ensure
that the runway surface type is compatible with the aircraft equipment (high flotation tires, soft
struts, etc.). Consider the following:
   7.19.1. Security of the operating area.
   7.19.2. Terrain and obstacle features along the approach or departure path.
   7.19.3. Runway surface conditions (dust, small holes, damaged Pierced Steel Plank (PSP),
   smooth).
   7.19.4. Surface temperature and density altitude.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  43


   7.19.5. Usable runway length and width.
   7.19.6. Surface acceleration and deceleration factors (soft, dry, wet, ice, slope).
   7.19.7. Gross weight of aircraft.
   7.19.8. Surface winds (head, tail, cross, gusty).
   7.19.9. Number of takeoffs and landings required.
   7.19.10. Ground Plan.
7.20. Arrival. Plan arrival altitudes to minimize conflict with terrain.
7.21. Traffic Pattern. When the environment permits, fly normal traffic patterns. Terrain may
require significant modifications to normal traffic patterns. Options are to enter the traffic
pattern via an initial, downwind, base, straight-in, or perpendicular to the runway.
7.22. Specific Aircrew Procedures. The following procedures are recommended in addition to
the normal procedures in the AFM:
   7.22.1. Close the engine bleed valves (if equipped) as required.
   7.22.2. During the final stage of landing roll, reduce reverse thrust, if conditions permit, to
   prevent debris from causing a restriction to visibility or engine damage.
   7.22.3. Do not land if the LZ is not properly identified or an abort signal is given.
   7.22.4. Brief the ground party and subsequent aircrews on any unexpected hazards
   encountered during takeoff or landing.

Section 7D—COMBAT LOADING

7.23. General. Combat loading is comprised of three types of operations: combat offload,
passenger combat loading, and rapid infiltration.
7.24. Combat Offload Training. No special authorization is required for combat offload
training using unilateral training loads. Specific procedures for combat offload in aircraft
capable of that operation will be stated in the aircraft addenda.
7.25. Passenger Combat Loading:
   7.25.1. All personnel in the cargo compartment will be seated and secured except those crew
   members having valid duties to perform. Use either personal restraining devices or aircraft
   tie down straps.
   7.25.2. When airlifting litter patients, position the litters longitudinally and secure each of
   the litters with a tie down strap.
       7.25.2.1. For one litter, hook the tie down strap into a floor ring, run laterally, wrapping
       the strap around each litter handle once, hook the ratchet end to the nearest tie down ring,
       and tighten.
       7.25.2.2. For two litters side by side, use two tie down straps for each end hooked into
       “D” row rings, run the straps laterally, one left and one right, over each outboard litter
       handle to the nearest tie down ring, and tighten.
 44                                                        AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


      7.25.2.3. For three litters side by side, wrap the straps around adjacent handles.
7.26. Rapid Infiltration Procedures.
   7.26.1. General.          These procedures are only authorized when conducting
   infiltration/exfiltration (infil/exfil) operations with SOF. In addition to the guidance provided
   here, crews will follow the guidance in aircraft addenda. All personnel in the cargo
   compartment will be seated and secured except those crew members having valid duties to
   perform. Troops will provide their own restraining devices. If they do not provide their own
   restraining devices, secure personnel using passenger combat loading procedures.
   7.26.2. The LM may use Infrared (IR) chemical lights taped to the side of the cargo
   compartment to illuminate inside of a blacked out cargo compartment if required.
   7.26.3. The LM will notify personnel at 60, 30, 20, 10, 6, “1 Minute”, and immediately prior
   to landing. Give a “Prepare to Land” advisory when minimums have been called.
   7.26.4. LMs will wear NVGs during blacked out operations. LMs will wear NVGs on
   aircraft with NVG-compatible lighting; however, they may be raised when NVG lighting is
   on.
   7.26.5. Procedures after Touchdown:
      7.26.5.1. Aircraft equipped with a rear cargo ramp and door:
          7.26.5.1.1. Open the cargo ramp and door to horizontal when the pilot states, “Clear
          to open,” or as prebriefed. Lower the ramp to the ground once the aircraft has
          stopped and the pilot states, “Clear to offload.” CAUTION: Maintain positive control
          of ground loading ramps.
          7.26.5.1.2. Position ground loading ramps. Note: If a time delay before onloading is
          anticipated, raise the ramp enough to allow the aircraft to taxi in the event of an
          emergency.
          7.26.5.1.3. Complete offload/onload.
          7.26.5.1.4. Raise canary slides/ground loading ramps.
          7.26.5.1.5. Raise the ramp to horizontal.
          7.26.5.1.6. Notify the pilot, “Clear to taxi.”
          7.26.5.1.7. Secure canary slides/ground loading ramps.
          7.26.5.1.8. Close the ramp and door.
          7.26.5.1.9. Turn on the red or NVG-compatible lights.
          7.26.5.1.10. Prior to takeoff, ensure vehicles/equipment and exits are secure, and
          warning lights are extinguished.
          7.26.5.1.11. If the aircraft is equipped, connect/engage Aerial Delivery System
          (ADS) arms after takeoff as soon as mission requirements allow.
          7.26.5.1.12. Check vehicle tie downs and secure cargo compartment after takeoff as
          soon as mission requirements allow.
      7.26.5.2. Aircraft not equipped with a rear cargo ramp and door:
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  45


           7.26.5.2.1. Open and secure the side door when the pilot states, “Clear to open.”
WARNING: The pilot will not clear any side exits to be opened until the aircraft is slowed to a
safe taxi speed. Side exits forward of any landing gear or propellers will not be opened until the
aircraft is stopped.
           7.26.5.2.2. When aircraft is stopped and the pilot states "Clear to Offload/Onload"
           the LM will complete offload/onload:
           7.26.5.2.3. Notify the pilot, “Clear to taxi.”
           7.26.5.2.4. Close the side door.
           7.26.5.2.5. Prior to takeoff, ensure vehicles/equipment and exits are secure, and
           warning lights are extinguished.
           7.26.5.2.6. Secure cargo compartment after takeoff as soon as mission requirements
           allow.

                                             Chapter 8

                              FIXED WING TRAINING POLICY

8.1. General. This chapter outlines procedures, requirements, and restrictions for training and
evaluation missions. See AFI 11-202, Vol 1 and Vol 3, and AFSOCI 11-219, Vol 1,
Additional/Supplemental Aircraft Training, for additional information. Note: The following
guidance is in addition to manufacturer restrictions or limitations. Manufacturer guidance will
always be followed unless the following guidance is more restrictive (higher altitudes, higher
airspeeds, etc.).
8.2. Instructor or Flight Examiner Briefings. Before all training and evaluation missions,
instructors or flight examiners will brief the crew on the mission profile, training requirements,
and objectives or evaluation requirements.
8.3. Debriefing. After all training flights, instructors will:
   8.3.1. Review and critique student performance.
   8.3.2. Review training requirements fulfilled for each student and aircrew member (all
   aircrew members should understand thoroughly what training was accomplished).
   8.3.3. Answer technical questions.
   8.3.4. Preview the objectives of the next mission.
   8.3.5. Complete training paperwork.
8.4. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures: Simulated landing emergencies are authorized
in day or night visual meteorological conditions (VMC) and day instrument meteorological
conditions (IMC) if the weather is at or above circling minimums. Simulated emergencies are
authorized in night IMC if the weather is at or above circling minimums or above 1,000 foot
ceiling and 2 miles visibility, whichever is higher.
   8.4.1. Practice emergencies which require simulating an engine shutdown, placing switches
   in other than their normal position, or an abnormal configuration as specified in the aircraft
   manual, only during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight
   examiner pilot is in one of the pilot seats.
       8.4.1.1. Instructor pilot candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under the supervision
       of a flight examiner pilot, not in the seat, may practice simulated emergency procedures
       during initial upgrade or requalification upgrade evaluations to instructor pilot.
       8.4.1.2. Preface all simulated emergencies with the word "simulated" and terminate
       simulated emergencies when an actual emergency arises.
       8.4.1.3. The following guidance will be adhered to during all engine-out training.
           8.4.1.3.1. Normally turns should be planned to be in the direction of the operating
           engine(s).
           8.4.1.3.2. Turns into the simulated failed engine should be minimized. Turns into the
           simulated failed engine are permissible but require a higher degree of pilot skill than
           with actual failed engines and must be smooth and coordinated.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                47


WARNING: Improper application of rudder or power can lead to an immediate out-of-control
situation where recovery might not be possible.
          8.4.1.3.3. Set zero thrust IAW the aircraft manual or the aircraft specific addendum.
   8.4.2. Do not perform simulated emergencies when passengers or medical crew members
   (except flight surgeons performing required flight duties) are aboard.
   8.4.3. Conduct simulated emergency flight procedures IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, and this
   directive. Use a realistic approach and do not compound emergencies. Limit simulated
   emergencies to non-critical phases of flight when possible. Notify the controlling agency if a
   nonstandard traffic pattern or pattern requiring special sequencing is anticipated.
   8.4.4. Training restrictions for specific flight maneuvers are listed in Paragraph 8.8.
8.5. Touch-and-Go Landings. Touch-and-go landings are authorized on designated training,
evaluation, or currency missions by any current and qualified pilot IAW the following
stipulations:
   8.5.1. The crosswind component must not exceed the AFM or equivalent demonstrated
   crosswind limitation.
   8.5.2. Touch-and-go landings are prohibited on icy runways. Pilots must use caution when
   performing touch-and-go’s on other than dry, hard-surfaced runways.
   8.5.3. Ceiling and visibility (RVR) must be at least 300 feet and 3/4 mile (RVR 40).
   8.5.4. Touch-and-go landings are not authorized when normal wake turbulence criteria are
   not met, or when intercepting or crossing the flight path of a heavy jet while performing an
   approach or landing.
   8.5.5. Minimum runway for touch-and-go landings: Not authorized for other than initial
   cadre until an appropriate distance is added to the appropriate aircraft addendum.
   8.5.6. Do not perform ground-idle touch-and-go landings (turbine aircraft).
8.6. Stop-and-Go Landings. Stop-and-go landings are authorized on designated training,
evaluation, or currency missions. Any current and qualified pilot may perform stop-and-go
landings IAW the following stipulations:
   8.6.1. The crosswind component must not exceed the AFM demonstrated crosswind
   limitation.
   8.6.2. Stop-and-go landings are prohibited on icy runways. Pilots must use caution when
   performing stop-and-go landings on other than dry, hard-surfaced runways.
   8.6.3. Ceiling and visibility (RVR) must be at least 300 feet and 3/4 mile (RVR 40).
   8.6.4. Stop-and-go landings are not authorized when normal wake turbulence criteria are not
   met, or when intercepting or crossing the flight path of a heavy jet while performing an
   approach or landing.
   8.6.5. Runway remaining for takeoff must meet the requirements of Paragraph 7.10.1.1 of
   this instruction.
 48                                                    AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


8.7. Simulated Instrument Flight. Do not use a hood or other artificial vision-restricting
device for any phase of flight. Simulated instrument flight may be flown and logged without use
of a vision-restricting device.
8.8. Training Maneuver Restrictions.
   8.8.1. Aborted Takeoff. Authorized during day or night VMC. Crosswind component must
   not exceed 75% of the AFM demonstrated crosswind limitation. The runway must be dry,
   hard-surface and long enough to meet normal takeoff distance requirements. Runway width
   must be the greater of 400% of the wheel track or equal to the wingspan. Initiate the abort by
   stating, "REJECT" before refusal speed. Do not practice aborts from touch-and-go or stop-
   and-go landings. If actual engine shutdown due to a simulated malfunction is to be practiced,
   it must be pre-briefed.
   8.8.2. Actual Engine Shutdown/Propeller Feathering and Air Start. One engine may be shut
   down in day VMC only at a minimum of 5,000 feet above the ground or cloud deck,
   whichever is higher. Do not shut down the engine unless the aircraft can remain clear of
   clouds and recover and land under visual flight rules.
   8.8.3. Steep Turns. Determine stall speeds prior to making turns. Authorized in day VMC
   only at a minimum of 3,000 feet AGL, 3,000 feet above the cloud deck, or the manufacturer's
   recommended altitude, whichever is higher. Do not exceed 60° of bank. (Instructor not
   required.)
   8.8.4. Air Minimum Control Speed (Vmca) Demonstration. Stall speed and engine
   inoperative minimum control should be determined prior to flight. Authorized in day VMC
   only, at a minimum altitude so that recovery is completed by 3,000 feet AGL, 3,000 feet
   above the cloud deck, or the manufacturer's recommended altitude, whichever is higher.
   Initiate recovery at the first recognition of loss of directional control by simultaneously
   reducing the power on the operating engine and/or reducing the angle of attack as necessary
   to regain directional control and airspeed.
CAUTION: There is a density altitude above which the stall speed is higher than the engine
inoperative minimum control speed. When this density altitude exists below 3,000 AGL because
of high elevations, high temperatures, or both, an effective flight demonstration of loss of
directional control may be hazardous and should not be attempted. If it is determined prior to
flight that the stall speed is above or equal to VMC, this flight demonstration is impracticable.
   8.8.5. Stalls:
       8.8.5.1. Power-Off Stalls. Determine actual stall speeds prior to maneuver. Authorized
       in day VMC only, at a minimum altitude so that recovery is completed by 3,000 feet
       AGL, 3,000 feet above the cloud deck, or the manufacturer's recommended altitude,
       whichever is higher. The stall may be entered from either straight or turning flight in the
       approach and landing configuration. Initiate recovery at the prebriefed point (when
       buffet or decay of control effectiveness is encountered or actual stall is reached) or if
       engine RPM decay is detected, or any abnormal engine indication is discovered.
       8.8.5.2. Power-On Stall. Determine actual stall speeds prior to maneuver. Authorized in
       day VMC only at a minimum of 3,000 feet AGL, 3,000 feet above the cloud deck, or the
       manufacturer's recommendation altitude, whichever is higher. In some high performance
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                49


       aircraft, the power setting for power-on stalls may have to be reduced below takeoff
       power to prevent excessive high pitch attitudes (greater than 30° nose up). In the absence
       of a manufacturer or addendum recommended power setting, use no more than
       approximately 55-60 percent of full power as a guideline. The stall should be entered in
       the takeoff or departure configuration and at V2. Initiate recovery when buffet or decay
       of control effectiveness is encountered, actual stall speed is reached, engine RPM decay
       is detected, or any abnormal engine indication is discovered, whichever occurs first.
CAUTION: There is a density altitude above which the stall speed is higher than the engine
inoperative minimum control speed. Simulated or actual engine-out, power-on stalls are
prohibited.
   8.8.6. Slow Flight. Fly at 1.2 stall speed clean (Vs) with corresponding flap settings. Do not
   exceed half standard rate or 15° of bank. Authorized in day VMC only at a minimum of
   3,000 feet AGL, 3,000 feet above the cloud deck, or manufacturer's recommended altitude,
   whichever is higher.
   8.8.7. Go-Around or Missed Approach. Minimum altitude is 500 feet AGL when aircraft,
   equipment, or personnel are on the runway. Initiate VFR go-around no lower than 100 feet
   AGL when practicing simulated emergencies other than engine failure. Initiate practice
   instrument missed approaches no lower than the minimum altitude for the approach.
   (Instructor not required.)
   8.8.8. Simulated Engine Failure Engine-Out Landing.
       8.8.8.1. Simulate engine failure no lower than 300 feet AGL.
       8.8.8.2. The simulated failed engine should be set at zero-thrust at an airspeed greater
       than best climb speed single engine (Vxse) or minimum control speed (Vmc) +5,
       whichever is greater.
       8.8.8.3. Use all engines for touch-and-go takeoffs.
   8.8.9. Simulated Engine-Out Go-Around or Missed Approach. Initiate simulated engine-out
   go-around no lower than 200 feet AGL. Initiate simulated engine-out missed approach no
   lower than the minimum altitude for the approach.

                         FIXED WING TACTICAL PROCEDURES

Section 9A—PLANNING

9.1. General. If a specific down range mission requires training of tactical procedures not
described in this instruction or aircraft addenda:
   9.1.1. HQ AFSOC/A3 must approve the specific tactical training to be accomplished prior to
   deployment.
   9.1.2. Prior to the commencement of tactical training, a training plan must first be approved
   by HQ AFSOC/A3T, HQ AFSOC/A3V, and HQ AFRC/A3T and HQ AFRC/A3V if AFRC
   units are affected.
9.2. Weather Requirements. Weather must be VFR IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, for all tactical
operations.
9.3. Altimeter Settings. Use the best available altimeter setting. If the current altimeter setting
is not known, set altimeters to the minimum setting briefed for the mission.
9.4. Minimum En Route Time. En route flight time from takeoff to time over target (TOT)
will be sufficient to safely accomplish all required checklists. For airdrops involving personnel,
the AC and jumpmaster must approve en route time of less than 20 minutes.
9.5. En Route Airspeeds.
   9.5.1. High-Altitude. Some missions include a high-altitude portion of flight prior to and
   after penetration from target area. Missions must be planned to provide the crew with the
   flexibility necessary to compensate for such inflight factors as weather deviations, avoidance
   of reported and unreported ground or air threats, and unexpected head or tail winds.
   9.5.2. Low-Altitude. Arrival of the aircraft over the specific target at a designated time will
   be within ± one minute. Gaining or losing significant amounts of time at low-level is highly
   undesirable. The gain or loss of time should be accomplished prior to low-level so that
   planned low-level entry time is achieved.
9.6. En Route Altitudes.
   9.6.1. High-Level. The selected altitude will depend upon factors such as fuel consumption,
   traffic control separation, radar capabilities, and meteorological data.
   9.6.2. Low-Level. The selected altitude depends upon factors such as threats, moon
   illumination, equipment limitations, weather, and terrain/cultural features. Fly the highest
   altitude using the following criteria:
       9.6.2.1. Day VMC/Night VMC with NVGs. Maintain 300 feet AGL modified contour
       or as specified in addendum.
           9.6.2.1.1. Night VMC without NVGs. Maintain a minimum of 500 feet above the
           highest obstacle within 3 nm of route centerline for each route segment.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  51


       9.6.2.2. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). MSA is a moderately low-altitude, which will
       provide positive terrain clearance when flight conditions are unacceptable for normal
       operations. To compute the MSA for day, add the MSL elevation of the highest
       obstruction or terrain feature within 3 nm of route centerline to the AGL flight altitude
       for that leg. For night visual operations, MSA will be computed by adding 500 feet to the
       MSL altitude of the highest obstacle or terrain feature within 3 nm (nautical miles) of
       route centerline. Round all MSAs to the next higher 100-foot increment.
       9.6.2.3. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is an altitude, which will provide positive
       terrain clearance in IMC, during situations that require leaving the low-level structure.
       To compute the ESA, add 1,000 feet to the MSL elevation of the highest obstacle/terrain
       feature within 10 nm of course centerline for that route/route segment. For mountainous
       terrain, use 2,000 feet. Round to the next higher 100 foot increment.
9.7. Mission Planning. One day will normally be allocated for mission planning (not applicable
to AFRC units). Designate the crew members required to participate. They should be exempted
from other duties so their full attention will be on the mission. Identify individual
responsibilities to efficiently use the time available. Unit training missions and exercises should
involve real world scenarios from planning to debrief. Plan for the current mission requirements
and then plan for the "worst case" situation (i.e., max gross weight, adverse winds, abnormal fuel
consumption, enemy compromise, downed aircraft, etc.).
   9.7.1. Mission Planning Software. Mission planning should be accomplished using Portable
   Flight Planning System (PFPS) if possible. Other mission planning programs such as Direct
   User Access Terminal System (DUATS), Jeppesen can be used but must be verified through
   manual calculations.
   9.7.2. In preparation for mission planning, attempt to obtain, as much as possible, the
   following:
       9.7.2.1. High quality imagery of target area and landing zone. This facilitates final
       approach planning and LZ recognition.
       9.7.2.2. Landing surface dimensions, obstacles, and surface conditions.
       9.7.2.3. Moisture at the LZ or any other meteorological element that might affect landing
       surface weight bearing capability.
       9.7.2.4. Assemble as many different charts and photographs of the area of operations as
       possible. As a minimum the following three charts are required, when available.
           9.7.2.4.1. Joint Operations Graph (JOG) 1:250,000. The JOG or equivalent is the
           primary chart for planning and flying the en route portion of the mission. The scale
           provides for a relatively small chart, uncluttered with extraneous information. It has
           latitude/longitude and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, and when
           properly prepared, is very "night" compatible.
           9.7.2.4.2. VFR Sectional or Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC) 1:500,000. The VFR
           sectional is consulted because it is updated more frequently than the JOG. It also
           provides accurate information on controlled airspace, major towers, airports, beacons,
           and power lines as well as current magnetic variation. The sectional should normally
 52                                                      AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


           not be used for 500 foot contour flying as its scale does not allow sufficient detail for
           accurate pilotage, and is relatively cluttered, unless JOGs are not available.
           9.7.2.4.3. Tactical 1:50,000 or larger. The tactical chart (1:50,000) is used to
           accurately locate and confirm unique map features and to transfer them to the JOG. It
           displays more detail in those areas, which may be difficult to interpret on the JOG. It
           should be used for the run in from Initial Point (IP) to LZ/DZ. Consider using
           geological survey charts if 1:50,000 charts are not available. Relief charts are also
           very helpful, when available. Note: Use caution when transitioning to 1:50,000
           charts from the JOG. The aircraft is traveling at a relatively faster rate over this chart
           and pilotage pacing will increase.
       9.7.2.5. Use demographics and cultural features to facilitate identifying tactics and
       operating window. Note: If these requirements are not satisfied, additional maneuvering
       and reconnaissance may be required in the target area.
9.8. Chart Preparation. Draw the route of flight on a topographic chart of 1:250,000 scale or
larger. Center symbols depicting checkpoints, IPs, objectives, and so forth on the point. Course
lines will not be drawn through these symbols. It is absolutely imperative that the navigation
chart be prepared accurately with extreme care and attention to detail. Use one chart per
mission. The entire route of flight from departure point to recovery point should be included on
a chart. Since chart scale and route length may create large charts unsuitable for the flight deck
it may be necessary to strip charts into workable sizes. When stripped charts are used, a larger
scale chart such as a sectional should be prepared with the route and turn points to allow for
major unplanned deviations during critical mission phases and emergency egress. Do not use the
same chart for a different mission in the same area. Avoid cluttering the chart. Outline only
those features that you expect to see (significant terrain contours, railroads, power lines, towers,
etc.). Annotate the chart with the following items:
   9.8.1. Circled and labeled turn points/check points connected by course lines. Course-lines
   may be plotted either point-to-point or radius of turn.
   9.8.2. A circle with a diagonal line will depict emergency airfields.
   9.8.3. A line across the course line will depict the combat entry point (CEP).
   9.8.4. Annotate time marks, or distance marks, or both on the low-level course line.
   9.8.5. Magnetic course, leg distance, leg time, and MSA will be annotated in a course arrow
   box along each leg of the route. Optional course arrow boxes can be used as long as they
   contain, as a minimum, the above listed information.
   9.8.6. ESA for the route/route segment and MSA for each leg/leg segment, as applicable.
   ESA will be conspicuously annotated on the chart. Circle the obstruction that each MSA is
   based upon.
   9.8.7. Low-level charts will be annotated with any added, deleted, or changed information as
   contained in the most recent Chart Update Manual (CHUM) or supplement. Charts will be
   chummed at least 10 nm either side of the planned route of flight. On the chart, individuals
   will annotate current CHUM, chart edition, date chart completed and ground speed chart was
   drawn for.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 53


   9.8.8. Special use airspace, military training routes, and other airspace boundaries that may
   affect the mission within 3 nm of course centerline.
   9.8.9. Visual navigational checkpoints between turn points.
   9.8.10. Location of inflight warnings.
   9.8.11. For multi-engine aircraft, compute a single engine maximum altitude to determine if
   single engine capability exists along the route of flight.
9.9. Low-Level Log. Use a low-level log to plan all low-level missions.
   9.9.1. The flying pilot will use an inflight low-level log during all low-level missions. The
   log may be computer generated or manually prepared. As a minimum, the log will contain
   the following information: ESA for the route or route segment, name of each turn point and
   coordinates, and for each leg, magnetic course, distance, time, and MSA.
   9.9.2. The navigating pilot is encouraged to use a low-level log inflight; however, it is not a
   substitute for an individually prepared route chart.
   9.9.3. The navigator, if part of the crew complement, will prepare and use both a chart and a
   low-level log.
9.10. Route and Turn Point Selection. The route to and from the target area must be tactically
sound but not so difficult as to inhibit successful navigation. Each mission will differ and
involve numerous variables. Listed below are general rules for proper route selection.
   9.10.1. Route Selection.
       9.10.1.1. Avoid brightly-lit areas, roads, and population centers.
       9.10.1.2. Avoid planning the route near navaids or airports. Hazards include other
       aviation operations oriented on these facilities.
       9.10.1.3. Plan to negotiate large north-south valleys on the upwind side, and if able, also
       on the moonlit side. This helps avoid turbulence and shadows cast by the moon, and
       permits silhouetting of terrain features for navigation.
       9.10.1.4. Plan to negotiate narrow valleys and passes in an east-west or west-east
       direction (depending on where the moon is) so the terrain will be visible and shadows
       avoided.
       9.10.1.5. Avoid planning a route that heads directly into a low angle rising or setting
       moon. Alter the course, as necessary, to fly a zigzag course when left with no other
       choice.
       9.10.1.6. Consider selecting intermediate reference points (power lines, towers, roads,
       rivers, ponds, railroads, etc.) along each leg of the route for course confirmation and
       timing. Computing hard times for each of these points is time consuming but valuable.
       This provides rapid feedback on time status, which enables the crew to more easily
       recover in case of a late departure or mission time of arrival (TOA) changes.
       9.10.1.7. Anticipate power lines/wires being located near roads, towers, and buildings in
       open fields. Warn the pilot of upcoming power lines, towers, and other obstructions.
54                                                    AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


     9.10.1.8. Plan alternate routes and cut-offs in the event the primary route is unusable due
     to weather, mission TOA changes, late departures, etc. It is especially important to plan
     alternate run-ins in case of runway change. Mission planning and adherence to the
     planned route of flight is critical to the success of low-level operations. Flying off
     centerline may be necessary for more effective terrain masking or to avoid populated
     areas. These adjustments should be made during mission planning, if possible. Aircrews
     may deviate from planned route inflight due to unforeseen factors. Keep deviations to
     the minimum required. Maintain position awareness at all times.
  9.10.2. Turn Point Selection. After a general route has been determined, select turn points to
  control movement and time along the route. Study the turn points carefully using all
  available charts and photos. Listed below are some considerations for turn-point selection.
     9.10.2.1. Turn points should be unique natural or man-made features, which are
     detectable at a distance. Avoid features that are only visible when directly overhead.
     (Example: A small bridge in heavy vegetation or a small road X in the forest.)
     9.10.2.2. Turn points should contrast with the surrounding terrain. Small paved roads
     are poor features to use in terrain with heavy vegetation, but provide excellent contrast in
     a desert environment. Small bodies of water provide very little contrast in terrain with
     vegetation, but contrast well in the desert.
     9.10.2.3. Avoid selecting turn points near towns as the town will invariably grow and
     may make detection of the turn point difficult.
     9.10.2.4. Turn points should not be in the vicinity of bright lights.
     9.10.2.5. Turn points should be confirmed by using a prominent feature along the route
     and close to the turn point.
     9.10.2.6. Consider the moon angle and illumination. The turn point should never fall
     within the shadow cast by nearby terrain features. A moon in front of the aircraft will
     make turn point identification difficult.
     9.10.2.7. Try to select prominent barriers near turn points. It is often better to discard a
     good turn point with no barrier in favor of a more difficult turn point with an excellent
     barrier.
     9.10.2.8. The first and last turn points of the route are the most important. An easily
     identifiable feature should be used even if the flight route must be altered slightly. This
     helps ensure positive location and timing. When planning an IP, allow enough time to
     get the aircraft configured and stable for the approach, but not so much time that drift
     becomes a limiting factor.
     9.10.2.9. If possible, LZs should have an IP that aligns the run-in with the runway axis.
     However, a good IP is more important than an exact alignment with the runway heading.
     If the environment allows, consider conducting a "270" maneuver. This maneuver allows
     for IPs 90° off runway axis, and for an "unaided" LZ, easier identification of the landing
     area. Allow ample time to complete the maneuver in planning.
     9.10.2.10. In varying terrain, make note of the MSL altitude at each turn point to aid in
     turn point identification. This technique is especially valuable in mountainous terrain.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 55


9.11. Crew Briefing. It is imperative that a complete and detailed crew briefing is conducted
prior to low-level flight. This briefing is normally conducted by the navigator or the navigating
pilot, and covers as a minimum the following items:
   9.11.1. ESA and the determining obstacle.
   9.11.2. Alternate airfields.
   9.11.3. Combat entry point.
   9.11.4. The location of inflight warnings.
   9.11.5. For each leg, the course, distance, time, MSA and significant terrain or threats.
   9.11.6. The objective area. Review the survey and any aerial photography or tactical charts
   (1:50,000) available and brief the following items:
       9.11.6.1. For an LZ, brief the runway orientation, the run-in orientation, the LZ
       dimensions, significant obstacles, expected markings, planned point of touchdown and its
       coordinates, go-around point, escape route in the event of a balked landing, and compare
       LZ length to performance data for landing and for takeoff.
       9.11.6.2. For a DZ, brief the DZ orientation, its dimensions, significant obstacles,
       expected markings, point of impact (PI) and its coordinates, escape route, type of drop,
       altitude, green light time, Computed Air Release Point (CARP) or High-Altitude Release
       Point (HARP), and emergency procedures.
   9.11.7. Action to follow (i.e., combat exit point, subsequent low-level route).
   9.11.8. Pilots will brief emergency actions for loss of NVGs during critical phases of flight
   (takeoffs, landings, airdrops, etc.) during the mission briefing. Specific procedures are
   aircraft commanders’ discretion.

Section 9B—EN ROUTE

9.12. Inflight Aircrew Procedures. WARNING: It is recognized that 3 to 3 1/2 seconds are
needed from the time a stimulus (perceived closure rate, crew member input, etc.) is received and
recognized until the reaction (control input, crew member action, etc.) to the stimulus is
complete. All crew members need to be cognizant of this relationship, especially during critical
phases of flight.
   9.12.1. For aircraft equipped with a radar/radio altimeter, set the altitude clearance markers
   to 90% (if equipped) of the desired route altitude. Activation of the low-altitude warning
   system indicates the aircraft is too low and an immediate correction is necessary.
   9.12.2. For aircraft not equipped with an operable radar/radio altimeter, do not fly below
   MSA at night.
   9.12.3. Updating the computer navigation system. Computer navigation system updates help
   maintain course and assist the visual acquisition of route checkpoints. Updates may be made
   at intermediate visual checkpoints as well as turn points.
   9.12.4. Turns are normally made at the turn point. However, terrain masking may require
   turning at an offset turn point. When the turn point cannot be located visually, the turn will
 56                                                    AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


   be initiated when at the preplanned linear boundary, the leg time has elapsed, or the computer
   navigation system distance-to-go stops decreasing.
   9.12.5. GPS/FMS Procedures. When operating aircraft with GPS/FMS systems installed,
   aircrews may use the FMS for situational awareness and as a backup to visual navigation.
   Aircrews operating aircraft without GPS/FMS installed may use portable GPS units (PGUs)
   IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3. PGUs may be connected to aircraft power if properly grounded.
   Ensure system use and operation does not interfere with navigation or aircraft control.
   9.12.6. Emergency Procedures.
       9.12.6.1. Disorientation. When a crew becomes disoriented, immediately establish your
       position by identifying a prominent terrain feature or landmark.
          9.12.6.1.1. Start a climb to the ESA. Continue the climb until the ESA is reached or
          a positive fix obtained.
          9.12.6.1.2. After obtaining a positive fix, descend and resume low-level operations.
          Crosscheck the timing and make any necessary adjustments.
          9.12.6.1.3. Terrain, weather, controlled airspace, and mission are factors to consider
          when executing an emergency climb. The AC must consider each of these factors
          prior to his decision to make an emergency climb.
       9.12.6.2. Engine-Out (Multi-Engine Aircraft):
          9.12.6.2.1. Discontinue low-level if feasible.
          9.12.6.2.2. If low-level flying is necessary, fly the appropriate minimum safe
          altitude.
   9.12.7. Overwater Low-Level Procedures. When descending into an overwater low-level
   environment, the water may not be visible until approximately 100 feet AWL. To decrease
   the chance of impacting the water, match the descending Vertical Velocity Indicator (VVI) to
   the height above the water. Additional crew member(s) will backup the pilots by monitoring
   VVI and altimeters.
   9.12.8. En Route Airspeed. During night low-level operations, the crew must remain alert
   and be prepared to react properly in the event of an emergency, particularly engine failure.
   To help provide a margin of safety, fly the low-level route IAW the following procedures:
       9.12.8.1. Minimum airspeed is best rate of climb airspeed (Vy, Vyse, or Vfto) with flaps
       up, and best angle of climb speed (Vx,Vco,V2) with flaps set at approach/takeoff.
       9.12.8.2. When minimum airspeeds result in excessive groundspeed, use offset
       maneuvering, orbits, etc., to control en route time.
9.13. Aircrew Duties. Specific duties are:
   9.13.1. Flying Pilot. Primarily responsible for terrain clearance, heading, and airspeed.
   Obstruction avoidance area of responsibility is immediately ahead and to their side of the
   aircraft.
   9.13.2. Nonflying Pilot. Obstruction avoidance area of responsibility is immediately ahead
   and to their side of the aircraft. Perform navigational duties to back up the navigator, if
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 57


   applicable, to include pilotage and checking the accuracy of the turn point brief. After the
   turn brief, both pilots should reset their heading markers to the new course when able.
   Monitor the pilot’s airspeed, heading and bank angle as a backup. If flying an aircraft not
   requiring a navigator, the nonflying pilot assumes those duties as outlined in Paragraph
   9.13.4. Note: During low-level operations, the pilots must be in their seats at all times. If
   either pilot must leave the seat, climb to the appropriate MSA prior to leaving the seat.
   9.13.3. Flight Engineer (FE) (if applicable). Primarily responsible for aircraft systems
   management and cockpit equipment operation, unless briefed otherwise. Backs up pilots on
   airspeeds, altitudes, headings, and terrain avoidance. Since the pilots are focusing their
   outside attention close to the aircraft, the FE clears farther ahead for obstructions and other
   aircraft.
   9.13.4. Navigator (if applicable). Primarily responsible for navigation and time control.
   Back up the navigating pilot on timing calls. Provide the turn point information to include
   new magnetic course, distance, MSA, description of turn point, and significant terrain
   description. The other pilot will acknowledge the new magnetic course. The turn point
   briefing and course acknowledgment must be completed prior to the turn point so as not to
   distract the crew from positively identifying the turn point. Accomplishes other duties as
   briefed.
   9.13.5. Loadmaster (LM) (if applicable). Back up pilots on airspeeds, altitudes, headings,
   and terrain avoidance. Since the pilots are focusing their outside attention close to the
   aircraft, the LM clears farther ahead for obstructions and other aircraft. The LM performs
   other duties as directed by the PIC or as contained in the aircraft specific addendum.
   9.13.6. Safety Observer (SO) (if applicable). An SO may be added to the crew at the
   discretion of the PIC. The SO will be assigned duties as directed by the PIC after
   coordination with primary crew members or as contained in the aircraft specific addendum.

Section 9C—ARRIVAL

9.14. Navigating to Covert Landing Zones. Some missions may require operations into
unmarked and uncontrolled LZs. Mission effectiveness depends upon detailed intelligence,
extensive aircrew planning and study, precision en route navigation and time control, accurate
and timely LZ recognition, and positive aircrew coordination.
   9.14.1. Markings. LZs are marked in one of the following Airfield Marking Patterns (AMP)
   as defined in AFI 13-217.
   9.14.2. Training. Aircrews will normally use AMP-3 with covert lighting or AMP-4.
   9.14.3. Fuel Planning. The chance of a successful landing to an unmarked LZ decreases
   when equivalent moon illumination is less than 5% or there is little or no contrast between
   the LZ and surrounding area. Plan 20 minutes additional fuel for operations involving
   unmarked LZs. Strong consideration should be given to AMP-3 configurations in this case.
9.15. Landing Zone (LZ) Surveys. All LZs must be surveyed IAW AFI 13-217 and/or airfield
information is available in official publications.
9.16. Terminal Area Landing Procedures.
 58                                                     AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


   9.16.1. Initial Approach. When pre-mission intelligence requirements are not satisfied for
   surveyed LZs, additional maneuvering and reconnaissance may be required in the target area.
   Note: During operational training, aircraft must be stabilized and aligned with the runway
   from 100 feet AGL on final to touchdown or a go-around must be accomplished. If the
   flying pilot determines that the actual touch down point is going to be different than what
   was briefed he must verbalize this.
   9.16.2. Communications. If landing clearance or go-around signals are to be given via radio,
   two-way communications with the reception committee must be established prior to landing.
   If comm-out procedures are used, presence of a pre-briefed signal constitutes clearance to
   land. A signal must be pre-briefed to direct a go-around. Radio clearance to land is the
   primary method when more than one aircraft is using the landing zone.

Section 9D—NAVIGATING TO THE RELEASE POINT

9.17. General.
   9.17.1. Positioning. Accurately positioning the aircraft at the release point is the most
   critical phase of the airdrop mission. Crew coordination is of the utmost importance to
   ensure that all warnings and checklists are completed, proper DZ line up is maintained, and
   TOT is within established tolerances. For visual airdrops at night the flight crew will wear
   NVGs to accomplish drops on covertly marked or unmarked drop zones.
   9.17.2. The navigator (or pilot if no navigator position) is responsible for computing a
   release point for all drops. Actual release is made by, but not limited to, the following
   methods:
      9.17.2.1. CARP/HARP.
      9.17.2.2. Ground Marked Release System (GMRS).
      9.17.2.3. Jumpmaster directed. (The pilots will compare their CARP/HARP with that of
      the jumpmaster and resolve any significant differences prior to the drop).
      9.17.2.4. Voice Initiated Release System (VIRS)
   9.17.3. Aircrew Procedures. These are basic procedures used to arrive at the release point.
      9.17.3.1. The navigator (or pilot if no navigator position) will brief the crew on the
      release method, the CARP/HARP location, the expected drift, release point location,
      desired magnetic heading (MH), drop altitude, drop airspeed, minimum safe altitude
      between IP and DZ, ground hazards/terrain in the drop area, escape heading, and altitude
      to be flown after drop.
      9.17.3.2. Airspeed adjustments for TOT control should be completed prior to reaching
      the IP.
      9.17.3.3. Use course corrections that will position the aircraft upwind the required
      distance from centerline track so that large corrections will not be required on the final
      approach to the release point.
      9.17.3.4. Steer to the release point as applicable for the type release.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    59


       9.17.3.5. Fly the AGL/MSL altitude and airspeed. When MSL altitudes are flown, the
       pressure altimeter is the primary reference, with the radar/radio altimeter set 50 feet
       below drop altitude. The pilots are responsible for maintaining altitude, airspeed, and
       terrain separation.
       9.17.3.6. Ten seconds prior to the release point, the navigating pilot or navigator will
       call, “Ten seconds."
       9.17.3.7. At the release point (or at the prebriefed point for jumpmaster directed [JMD]
       drops ) the green light (if so equipped) will be turned on at the command of the
       navigating pilot or navigator. If not equipped with airdrop lights, a prebriefed signal will
       be used.
       9.17.3.8. During the Drop:
           9.17.3.8.1. Maintain the desired track, making small corrections as necessary.
           9.17.3.8.2. The navigating pilot or navigator will call "Red Light" at the end of the
           programmed/computed time delay. If not equipped with airdrop lights, use a
           prebriefed signal.
           9.17.3.8.3. If the LM observes any delay or malfunction of equipment, or delay of a
           parachutist to jump, advise the pilot.
       9.17.3.9. Drop Zone Escape. After the aircraft has been reconfigured and the static lines
       have been retrieved/cut, the remainder of the completion of drop checklist should be
       completed in a timely manner so that crew duties pertaining to continued low-level are
       not diverted.
9.18. Visual Airdrop Procedures. As soon as the DZ is visible and identified by the pilots,
they jointly confirm the release point location, lateral offset, and track required. The pilot flying
the aircraft then assumes the responsibility for maintaining the desired track.
9.19. Ground Marked Release System (GMRS). Airdrops may be made using the GMRS. In
this system, supported ground forces are responsible for computing a release point and providing
ground markings (panels or lights). The DZ markings will be coordinated prior to the mission
during joint planning. Aircrew procedures are the same as those employed during a manual
CARP drop. There are several DZ marking patterns. The DZ marking most commonly used is
the inverted "L". The inverted "L" utilizes a standard four marker pattern placed 100 meters left
of the desired release point. The corner marker panel (release point marker) may be used for
authentication through the use of a code light or special panel signal. Execute the drop when the
aircraft arrives directly opposite and 100 meters to the right of the corner marker panel on the
pre-briefed inbound heading. Refer to AFI 13-217 for GMRS markings depictions.
9.20. Verbally Initiated Release System. VIRS is an airdrop method by which ground
personnel provide verbal steering guidance to an aircraft and call the release when the aircraft
arrives over a predetermined point on the ground. VIRS will only be performed by qualified
CCT, Tactical Air Liaison Officer (TALO), Drop Zone Control Officer (DZCO), Pararescue, or
other properly trained personnel.
   9.20.1. This option may be selected under the following conditions:
       9.20.1.1. CARP procedures cannot be used.
 60                                                     AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


      9.20.1.2. The DZ release point is located in an area where the normal GMRS markings
      would not be visible from the aircraft.
      9.20.1.3. It is tactically impractical to mark the DZ.
   9.20.2. When this option is selected:
      9.20.2.1. The ground party will compute the release point.
      9.20.2.2. The ground party will position on the intended release point, provide the
      aircrew with verbal steering guidance and call the release when the aircraft reaches the
      release point.
      9.20.2.3. The ground party should use the following terminology:
          9.20.2.3.1. "Turn Left or Right" directs approximately a half standard rate turn unless
          specified otherwise.
          9.20.2.3.2. "Stop Turn".
          9.20.2.3.3. "Standby" indicates approximately five seconds prior to the release point.
          9.20.2.3.4. "Execute, Execute, Execute" directs the release of the drop.
      9.20.2.4. Upon hearing "Standby", the pilot will notify the LM.            The load will be
      released on the first "Execute".
      9.20.2.5. The authentication procedures to be employed will be briefed prior to the
      mission. The procedure should be as simple and short as possible so as not to interfere
      with the approach to the DZ. Based on the limitations of radio equipment and terrain, a
      point will be identified as far out on the approach as possible where contact should be
      first attempted for authentication.
      9.20.2.6. The ground party must maintain positive visual contact with the aircraft at all
      times during the inbound approach. If, in a training situation, doubt exists that the
      airdrop can be safely executed, or if the DZ cannot be positively identified by the
      aircrew, a no drop will be called by either the ground party or the aircrew. In a combat
      situation, the ground party will direct the aircraft to the release point and call the release.
      In this situation, the lack of visual acquisition of the DZ by the aircrew will not, by itself,
      constitute grounds for calling a no drop. During VIRS airdrops the ground party
      providing the verbal steers accepts responsibility for the point of impact of the airdrop.
9.21. Jumpmaster Directed (JMD) Airdrops. When JMD airdrops are utilized, the following
restrictions and procedures apply:
   9.21.1. Prior to takeoff, a CARP or HARP will be calculated for each airdrop. The aircrew
   and the jumpmaster will compare predicted release points, resolve significant differences,
   and agree to a planned run-in and slow-down point. The pilot, LM, and jumpmaster will
   coordinate interphone procedures, verbal and visual signals.
   9.21.2. At completion of the slowdown, the LM will allow the jumpmaster to begin
   “spotting procedures”. The jumpmaster may spot from the aircraft ramp/side door or a
   window.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 61


   9.21.3. The aircrew may turn on the “green light” once the drop zone has been positively
   identified and drop clearance has been obtained, but no earlier than 1 minute prior to the
   aircrew-jumpmaster agreed upon HARP for free fall operations, or 30 seconds prior to the
   agreed upon CARP for static line drops. Personnel will not exit unless the green light is
   illuminated. Any time exit of the jumpers becomes unsafe, the aircrew will turn on the “red
   light” and the LM will direct the jumpmaster to stop the remaining jumpers.
   9.21.4. JMD airdrops will be accomplished VMC.              The jumpmaster’s unit accepts
   responsibility for accuracy or injury.
Note: Consult AFPD 62-6, USAF Airworthiness, Joint Service Specification Guide (JSSG)-
2001B, JSSG-2009, Airworthiness Certification Criteria, MIL-HDBK-516B, Airworthiness
Certification Criteria, for guidance on certification of additional aircraft for airdrop.

Section 9E—AIRDROP

9.22. Airdrop. Static Line airdrops will be conducted in VMC. High altitude low opening/high
altitude high opening (HALO/HAHO) airdrops may be accomplished "VFR on top" with AFI
11-202 Vol 3 cloud clearances, within active restricted airspace and a minimum of 1,000 foot
ceiling on the DZ. To accomplish HALO/HAHO while “VFR on top” the aircraft must be
appropriately equipped with suitable navigation equipment. Procedures will be specified in the
aircraft specific addendum. Pre-breathing, airspeed, altitudes and wind limits are as indicated in
Table 9.1, Table 9.2, Table 9.3, and Table 9.4. A manual or PFPS generated CARP/HARP will
be computed for all airdrops. (Reference AFI 11-231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures).
       9.22.1. Floor Loading of Personnel. Floor loading is only authorized in support of SOF
       and foreign counterparts during SOF operations, exercises and training, or during
       bilateral training in support of SOF. Floor loading of SOF will only be employed when
       the mission cannot be accomplished by using standard seating configurations.
       9.22.2. Ramp and Door Operations (Aircraft with Ramp and Door)/Side Door
       Operations:
           9.22.2.1. Clearance to Open. Depending on the tactical situation, it may be desirable
           to open the ramp and door or side door prior to the slow-down checklist. The pilot
           may direct ramp and door/side door(s) opening any time after the six-minute advisory
           has been completed and clearance from the LM is received. After the ramp and
           door/side door(s) is/are open, the LM is cleared to complete the slow-down checklist.
           Consider aircraft position and the possibility of dropped objects when the door is
           opened.
           9.22.2.2. Loadmaster-Jumpmaster Control. During the slow-down portion of the
           airdrop, the LM will relinquish control of the door/ramp to the jumpmaster. The LM
           will then take a position in such a manner as to provide maximum maneuverability
           for jumpmasters and safety personnel to perform their duties. Upon seeing the red
           jump lights illuminate, the LM will notify the jumpmaster or safety personnel of the
           red light condition. The LM will take no further action to stop any of the remaining
           parachutists. The LM will count (if possible) any parachutists that exit the aircraft
           after the red light has illuminated. Control of the door will revert back to the LM
           after all parachutists have exited or remaining parachutists have been stopped by the
 62                                                    AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


          jumpmaster or safety and cleared from the door area. For multiple passes (i.e.,
          racetracks), after assuming control of the door/ramp from the jumpmaster, the LM
          will maintain control of the door/ramp until completion of the slow-down checklist.
      9.22.3. Multiple Passes (Racetracks). Multiple passes will not be made unless directed
      or previously agreed upon by all units involved. In the event multiple passes are
      performed, regardless of the time interval involved, all airdrop checklists will be
      accomplished. In the event like drops are accomplished during multiple passes, the
      checklist may be initiated at a point commensurate with the available time and type of
      drop, at the discretion of the aircraft commander.
      9.22.4. Static Line Retrieval. To facilitate manual static line retrieval, airspeed will not
      be increased above 150 knots indicated air speed (KIAS) until static lines are retrieved.
      Loadmasters should allow static lines to wrap together before retrieving static lines. The
      LM will retrieve static lines as soon as possible after parachutist and/or para-bundle exit
      is completed or exiting is suspended.
      9.22.5. Tailgate Drops. Tailgate drops are those during which parachutists exit from the
      aircraft ramp. The following restrictions apply:
          9.22.5.1. Retrieve static lines and deployment bags prior to each additional pass to
          prevent fouling.
      9.22.6. Combination Drops. Combination drops are those during which parachutists exit
      from the aircraft ramp and door or side door(s) after the gravity release of an airdrop
      load. The drop altitude will be determined by the item requiring the highest drop altitude
      as listed in Table 9.3.
          9.22.6.1. Restrictions. Static lines will be retrieved after each pass to minimize
          fouling risk. For gravity ejected loads, for additional passes, close the cargo ramp
          and door or side door, if required, and rig IAW appropriate rigging procedures.
          9.22.6.2. Procedures. In addition to the equipment CARP, the aircrew will compute
          a personnel CARP down track from the equipment release point using the computed
          exit time for the equipment drop as the time interval between the equipment and
          personnel CARP. Use the same KIAS and altitude as for the equipment for this
          computation. If the computed point of impact falls within 150 yards of any boundary
          of the drop zone, inform the jumpmaster.
      9.22.7. Parachute Ballistics. Crews will not make airdrops using parachutes for which
      AFI 11231 does not list ballistics unless the user provides approved ballistic data or K
      factor. The ballistics or K factor should be approved by HQ AFSOC/A3V. This does not
      apply to formal/user test missions where the purpose of the test is to derive ballistic data
      for a specific load.
      9.22.8. Side Door Drops. Side door drops are those during which parachutists exit from
      the aircraft side door(s). The same restrictions in Paragraph 9.22.5.1 thru Paragraph
      9.22.7 apply.
9.23. No-Drop Decisions.
   9.23.1. Prior to one minute warning, when any condition exists that would make a safe drop
   doubtful, notify the aircraft commander.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     63


   9.23.2. After the 1 minute warning, any crew member observing a condition that would
   jeopardize a safe drop will transmit "No-Drop" on the interphone. The primary LM,
   nonflying pilot, and navigator (if on board) will acknowledge the no-drop. The aircraft
   commander will immediately instruct the crew to follow the appropriate procedures.
   9.23.3. On personnel airdrops where surface winds are unknown, e.g. blind drops to
   unmanned DZs, the jumpmaster and/or Army airborne mission commander (if designated)
   will be advised when drop altitude winds exceed 30 knots. In this instance, the decision to
   drop will be at their discretion.
   9.23.4. If a no-drop is called after the load restraint is removed and a racetrack is not
   planned, reapply the load restraint.
   9.23.5. When only Air Force (AF) personnel are involved, STS determines if surface
   conditions are hazardous to airdrop operations. For joint missions, the user makes the
   decision. If drops are suspended or canceled, STS or the user, as applicable, will inform the
   drop aircraft as soon as possible and ensure red smoke/lights/flares are displayed on the DZ.
9.24. Airdrop Emergencies. If a malfunction occurs during an airdrop, the LM will
immediately notify the pilot and take appropriate action. Specific emergency procedures for
each type airdrop are located in aircraft specific addendum to this regulation and in the airdrop
checklist. After all appropriate emergency actions are complete accomplish the completion of
drop checklist. Note: Prior to stations time, the pilot will ensure that all crewmembers have
reviewed the emergency procedures for the proposed airdrop. Detailed emergency briefings will
be conducted between the crew members.
9.25. Airdrop Communications Procedures.
   9.25.1. General. Airdrops should be performed with minimum radio transmissions.
   Predetermined markings and authentication procedures, along with precise timing by the
   aircrew, are the basic ingredients for successful mission accomplishment. The using forces
   are trained to operate with minimum communications. Drop clearance is confirmed by the
   aircrew observing or receiving proper authentication.
   9.25.2. Training Operations. Radio transmissions with the DZ are limited to those required
   for safety of flight considerations or factors affecting airborne force employment. This
   includes ATC directions, range clearance, unsafe surface conditions or mission changes.
   When the mission dictates radio silence, transmission of wind information and range/drop
   clearance is not required. Radio silence procedures will be coordinated prior to mission
   execution.
       9.25.2.1. Drop clearance in VMC is confirmed by the aircrew observing the proper
       authentication, that is, the pre-briefed block letter identifier, correctly colored smoke/flare
       or other pre-briefed drop zone acquisition aid or markings.
       9.25.2.2. For unmarked or blind drops to manned DZs, radio clearance is required to
       drop.
       9.25.2.3. No-Drop or Mission Cancellation. A no drop or mission cancellation is
       communicated by the absence of pre-briefed markings (visual or electronic), observation
       of the block letter X, or red smoke/flare.
9.26. Types of Drop Zones.
 64                                                    AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


   9.26.1. Point DZ. This DZ has a specified location versus an area DZ that does not have a
   specific location. The majority of drop zones are point DZs. The location, size, and marking
   of point DZs are determined prior to mission execution. The point of impact will be
   established a minimum of 100 yards from all boundaries of the DZ. The PI may be moved
   within the confines of the drop zone as long as the 100 yard buffer is maintained and both the
   user and supporter mutually agree upon its placement. When the PI is moved, the user
   assumes responsibility for injury to personnel and damage to equipment.
   9.26.2. Area DZ. An area DZ consists of a prearranged flight path over a series of
   acceptable drop sites located not more than 1/2 nm (one km) on either side of track. A line of
   flight is established between two points (A and B). The distance between the two points will
   not exceed 15 nm (28 km) and should have changes in ground elevation less than 300 feet
   (90 m). The reception committee is free to receive the drop at any location along the line of
   flight.
      9.26.2.1. Timing. The aircraft arrives at point "A" at the scheduled time and proceeds
      toward point "B." Once the DZ markings are located, the drop is conducted in the normal
      manner. All airdrop warnings (except the one minute warning) are based on TOA at
      point "A". The DZ will be marked for a total of 10 minutes, starting 2 minutes prior to
      ETA over point "A". Markings are removed at the end of the 10 minute period or when
      the first parachute is sighted.
      9.26.2.2. DZ Altitude. Because a specific point is not used, use the average elevation of
      a flat terrain area DZ or the highest elevation of a rolling terrain area DZ for the terrain
      elevation when completing the CARP. Fly this MSL altitude for the drop.
9.27. Drop Zone Survey and Safety of Flight Requirements.
   9.27.1. Drop Zone Survey. A DZ survey is required by the user during peacetime training
   for all aerial deliveries IAW AFI 13-217. The survey will be accomplished and signed by the
   user, (i.e., CCT, STS Army Special Forces (SF), or Navy SEALS). See AFI 13-217 and
   appropriate supplements for additional information. The Assault Zone Availability Report
   (AZAR) is an AMC source document for available surveyed DZs.
   9.27.2. Safety of Flight Review. A safety of flight review is required by AFSOC for all
   DZs. The review will be accomplished in conjunction with a DZ survey and will be signed
   by the appropriate approval authority IAW AFI 13-217. The airborne unit assumes all
   responsibility for personnel injury and damage on the DZ.
9.28. Drop Zone Markings.
   9.28.1. Marked Drop Zones. The drop zone is marked with a coordinated visual signal (e.g.,
   block letter, flares, smoke, mirror, etc.). No other markings are required. The PI is marked
   for CARP drops. The release point is marked for GMRS drops.
   9.28.2. Blind Drop Zones. The drop zone is unmarked. The aircrew confirms the DZ
   location and determines the release point by onboard navigational equipment or visual offset
   points. Note: The chance of a successful drop decreases if equivalent moon illumination is
   less than 5% and/or there is little or no contrast between the DZ and the surrounding area.
   Plan 20 minutes additional fuel for operations involving unmarked drop zones.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 65


9.29. Minimum Drop Zone Sizes. The minimum size DZ is mutually agreed upon by the Air
Force and using unit commanders having control of the operation. The size should be based on
mission requirements, aircraft or aircrew capabilities, and the items to be dropped. When
conducting drops on blind DZs, consider terrain, and chart/equipment accuracy. The minimum
DZ sizes in Table 9.5 can be used for planning. These tables are based on optimum conditions.
Safety zones have not been added to these tables. GMRS/VIRS and military free fall (MFF) DZ
sizes are the responsibility of the using agency. See AFI 13-217 for further guidance.

Section 9F—LOW-ALTITUDE AIRDROPS

9.30. Personnel Airdrops.
   9.30.1. Aircraft Configuration. The LM will ensure the configuration of the aircraft is
   consistent with the number of personnel to be airdropped. Troop seats will be raised or
   lowered, as required, by airborne personnel under the supervision and instruction of the
   aircrew LM.
   9.30.2. Aircrew Procedures. Refer to the aircraft specific expanded checklist for normal and
   emergency airdrop procedures contained in the aircraft specific attachments to this
   regulation.
WARNING: During personnel airdrops insure all personnel are secured to the aircraft or have a
static line connected prior to opening any doors. HALO/HAHO personnel will be configured
and ready to jump.
   9.30.3. Aircraft Emergency during Personnel Airdrop:
       9.30.3.1. When an aircraft emergency occurs during or after the time the parachutists
       stand up and hookup, the following procedures will apply:
          9.30.3.1.1. Under Acceptable Conditions:
              9.30.3.1.1.1. Maintain an acceptable altitude and attitude for the parachutists to
              evacuate the aircraft. The minimum acceptable altitude is 400 feet AGL. If the
              jump must be made at airspeed in excess of 150 KIAS, the parachutists will be
              advised of the airspeed and altitude.
              9.30.3.1.1.2. Order evacuation of the aircraft by giving the pre-briefed signals for
              preparation and bailout.
          9.30.3.1.2. Under Unacceptable Conditions. When conditions are not acceptable for
          aircraft evacuation and/or drop is aborted for other reasons, the following procedures
          apply:
              9.30.3.1.2.1. The red light will be turned "ON" (or prebriefed signal) and will
              remain on until all doors are closed, if applicable.
              9.30.3.1.2.2. The pilot will advise the LM, who in turn will advise the
              jumpmaster to have the parachutists unhook, take their seats, and fasten their
              safety belts.
 66                                                   AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


       9.30.3.2. When an aircraft emergency occurs before the time the parachutist's hookup,
       the crew will notify the jumpers to fasten their seat belts and prepare for an emergency
       landing.
9.31. Door Bundle.
   9.31.1. General. A7 or A21 containers weighing up to 500 pounds are referred to as door
   bundles and will be dropped from the aircraft using the personnel airdrop checklist. Door
   bundles may be dropped independently or in conjunction with personnel. When dropped
   with personnel, the bundle will be the first object to exit the aircraft.
       9.31.1.1. When followed by parachutist, door bundles dropped off the ramp and door or
       side door will be equipped with breakaway static lines IAW TO 13C7-1-11, Airdrop of
       Supplies and Equipment Rigging Containers, or with parachutes packed in T-10 bags.
       9.31.1.2. Bundles that exceed 500 pounds will be airdropped using Container Delivery
       System (CDS) procedures IAW the aircraft specific addendum.
   9.31.2. Release Point. When door bundles are dropped with personnel, compute the CARP
   for the first paratrooper exiting after the bundle. Compute an additional CARP for the door
   bundle to ensure that it will impact within the DZ boundaries. Release the bundle at the
   personnel CARP, followed by the parachutists when the door is clear. When a door bundle is
   the only object being dropped, base the release on the CARP for the bundle.
9.32. Container Delivery System (CDS). CDS is a method of airdropping supplies using
gravity to extract the load from the aircraft. The type containers used are A-22, double A-22 or
Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC). The bundles may be dropped with or without
parachutists. When performing combination drops, the parachutists will exit after the container.
For specific CDS/CRRC procedures refer to the aircraft specific attachment.
9.33. Free-Fall Delivery System. The delivery of certain types of supplies, such as bulk food
products or clothing, can be accomplished without the use of parachutes. For free drop, wind
drift need not be considered. Use the appropriate personnel airdrop checklist.
   9.33.1. Drop Altitude. Normally, free-drop is accomplished at much lower altitudes than
   those required for paradrops. When possible, free-drops will be made at 200 feet AGL or
   less, but not below 50 feet AGL (see Table 9.3).
   9.33.2. Drop Zone Size. The trajectory of the items being dropped will determine the DZ
   size requirements. As a rule, the DZ length required equals the altitude of the aircraft over
   the release point plus a safety margin of 100 feet added to each end. Applying this rule,
   when dropping from 200 feet AGL, the required length will be 200 feet (altitude) plus 200
   feet (safety margin) or 400 feet total.
9.34. Standard Airdrop Training Bundle (SATB).
   9.34.1. General. The 15-pound training bundle is designated the standard airdrop training
   bundle and may be dropped to simulate personnel or equipment airdrops. Conduct SATB
   missions at the altitude and airspeed specified for the type of drop being simulated and use
   the applicable tactical airdrop checklist. Training bundles will be assembled and have an
   identification tag attached IAW TO13C7-1-11, Appendix D. Training bundles will not be
   rigged with a breakaway static line.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                67


   9.34.2. Emergency Procedures: If a training bundle is outside the aircraft and fails to
   separate, make no attempt to retrieve it. Cut the bundle loose over the pre-briefed salvo area
   or DZ on clearance from the aircraft commander.

Section 9G—HIGH-ALTITUDE AIRDROPS

9.35. High-Altitude Mission Requirements. Airdrops conducted above 3,000 feet AGL are
considered to be high-altitude drops. In addition to the normal mission planning requirements,
the following are unique to high-altitude operations:
   9.35.1. Prominent terrain features within the drop area should be selected to position the
   aircraft on the inbound course and to determine the release point.
   9.35.2. Preflight weather and winds must be analyzed to determine the most advantageous
   inbound course. Whenever possible, the inbound course should be into the average wind
   vector.
   9.35.3. High-Altitude Oxygen: IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3. Airdrop above 25,000 feet require
   a waiver to AFI 11-202, Vol 3. Submit waivers through HQ AFSOC/A3V. (T-2)

Table 9.1. Pre-Breathing Times.
DROP ALTITUDE                   AIRCREW                           PARACHUTISTS
At or above 18,000 to 25,000'   30 Min                            30 Min HALO/HAHO

       9.35.3.1. Aerospace and Operational Physiologist (AOP) and Physiology Technician
       (PT) Requirements. An AOP and/or PT (AFSC 43A and 4M0X1) will accompany all
       missions operating above 20,000 feet MSL regardless of the type of airdrop. AOPs/PTs
       will brief aircrew and jumpers prior to first mission on physiological problems that may
       be encountered, the importance of proper pre-breathing, and any special requirements
       using the approved briefing guide. They will advise the aircraft commander and crew on
       use of oxygen equipment and depressurization schedule, preflight supplemental oxygen
       equipment, and advise/aid loadmasters in loading, positioning, and securing parachutists
       oxygen equipment. At least one AOP/PT will be on interphone at all times. AOP/PT
       flight duty station will be as required to monitor crewmembers, jumpers, and oxygen
       equipment. They will monitor and record pre-breathing times and exposure times at
       and/or above 10,000 ft, 20,000 ft MSL, and peak altitude to advise aircraft commander
       and direct the disposition of any physiological incidents until relieved by Flight Surgeon
       or appropriate medical personnel.
       9.35.3.2. HQ USAF/SGPA and HQ AFSOC/SG will be notified by the most expeditious
       manner of any physiological incident.
       9.35.3.3. Emergency Procedures. If any person experiences decompression sickness or
       unusual pain, the pilot will:
          9.35.3.3.1. Abort the mission.
          9.35.3.3.2. Begin a descent. The type and degree of sickness or pain will determine
          the descent.
 68                                                     AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


          9.35.3.3.3. Proceed to the nearest base at which qualified medical assistance is
          available.
          9.35.3.3.4. Advise the control tower of the emergency and request a doctor and an
          ambulance to meet the aircraft.
9.36. High-Altitude Personnel Drop (HALO/HAHO) Procedures. A HARP solution will be
computed for all high-altitude personnel drops unless specific mission directives dictate
otherwise.
   9.36.1. Flight Planning. In addition to the normal flight planning requirements to position
   the aircraft over the target area, the following are unique to HALO/HAHO operations using
   the HARP.
      9.36.1.1. Detailed instructions for computing the HARP are contained in AFI 11-231.
      9.36.1.2. Plot the preflight HARP and ensure the distance from the IP to the preflight
      HARP allows sufficient time for the aircrew to verify the run in, accomplish airdrop
      checklists, and if required, recompute and plot the inflight HARP. This should receive
      special consideration when performing HAHO airdrop operations.
      9.36.1.3. A large-scale chart prepared for inflight use is highly desirable. This allows the
      aircrew to update the inflight HARP for a visual release.
   9.36.2. Conduct Of Operations:
      9.36.2.1. If mission requirements dictate, crews may employ low-level flight to the target
      area with a climb for HALO/HAHO operations. This may enable the aircrew to obtain
      current winds for updating the preflight HARP during the climb. High-level flights are
      also possible but the HARP will have to be based on preflight winds. Positive
      identification of the drop zone area must be confirmed visually when conducting a visual
      HARP.
      9.36.2.2. Initial Lineup. It is desirable that the aircraft is at drop altitude, inbound to the
      HARP not later than six minutes prior to the HARP. This amount of time is necessary to
      update the HARP and position the aircraft on the correct inbound course.
      9.36.2.3. HARP Release.       The following methods may be used in determining the
      HARP.
          9.36.2.3.1. A visual drop may be accomplished whereby the pilot flies over the
          HARP. Positive identification of the drop zone area and/or HARP must be confirmed
          visually prior to calling the release. Verify an offset from the point of impact, which
          will ensure the aircraft will track over the HARP. Once proper alignment is obtained,
          pick a geographic point on the horizon and fly a drift killed heading toward this point.
          Choose a reference point far enough from the DZ to ensure the point remains in
          constant view. Selection of timing points will assist in calling the release point (green
          light) since the DZ will disappear under the nose of the aircraft. Timing points should
          be abeam the drop zone, prior to the HARP and identified prior to the 1 minute
          warning. Cultural features such as long straight roads or railroads make excellent
          timing points.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                               69


         9.36.2.3.2. An onboard navigation system release may be accomplished when pre-
         briefed and coordinated with the parachutists. When this procedure is used, enter the
         IP and preflight HARP coordinates into the system. Comply with Paragraph
         9.36.3.2 of this instruction when selecting an IP. Update the HARP as necessary to
         compensate for winds that are different than those forecasted. Fly FMS or GPS
         steering to the release point (green light). When airdropping IAW this procedure,
         visual identification of the DZ is not required.
  9.36.3. Drop Configuration:
     9.36.3.1. Flaps. IAW the aircraft specific addendum.
     9.36.3.2. Airspeed. Brief the jumpmaster on the airspeed used IAW Table 9.2.
     9.36.3.3. Altitude. Pressure altitude will be used as the airdrop altitude reference.
     9.36.3.4. Exits:
         9.36.3.4.1. Parachutists will normally exit from the ramp, if so equipped. All
         parachutists, with the exception of the jumpmaster, will stand forward of the ramp
         hinge/door opening until the one minute warning.
         9.36.3.4.2. All parachutists, including the jumpmaster, will exit the aircraft during
         the green light time.
  9.36.4. Communications and Signals:
     9.36.4.1. Hand Signals. The pilot or LM will coordinate the following hand signals with
     the jumpmaster:
         9.36.4.1.1. Time warnings (20, 10, 6, 3, and 1 minute) will be given to the
         parachutists by the LM pointing at a watch and indicating with fingers the correct
         warning.
         9.36.4.1.2. Wind velocity on the DZ will be given an open hand, palm up, moved
         horizontally and blowing into it and indicating with upturned fingers the speed of the
         wind.
         9.36.4.1.3. Passing the forefinger across the throat indicates a no-drop.
     9.36.4.2. Written Messages. The LM will carry pencil and paper and write out messages
     that cannot be passed by hand signals. Messages for the pilot from the parachutists will
     be written out.
  9.36.5. Briefing. The following items will be added to the pilot-jumpmaster briefing:
     9.36.5.1. Weather.
     9.36.5.2. Emergency descent procedures and time to descend to 10,000 feet MSL.
     9.36.5.3. HARP and prominent terrain features.
     9.36.5.4. DZ markings.
     9.36.5.5. Time at which all mission personnel will commence pre-breathing.
     9.36.5.6. Location and duration of the green light.

Section 9H—AIRDROP RELATED INFORMATION

9.37. Joint Airdrop Inspection Records. DD Form 1748, Joint Airdrop Inspection Record,
will be accomplished IAW AFJI 13-210, Joint Airdrop Inspection Records, Malfunction
Investigation, and Activity Reporting, prior to all equipment airdrops. Retention and disposition
of the form will be IAW AFJI 13-210, as supplemented. Exception: Door bundles and free
drop bundles.
9.38. Identification of Airdrop Items. Immediate identification of aerial delivery items that
land off the drop zone in unsecured areas may be necessary. The following procedures will aid
in denying the enemy usable items and in minimizing the risk of loss of life over items that may
be expendable. Aircraft commanders will be familiar with airdrop contents and the order in
which it leaves the aircraft for radio transmission to the combat control team, if requested.
Identify supplies or equipment by the following class numbering system:
   9.38.1. Class I - Food and daily expendables.
   9.38.2. Class II - Hardware, guns.
   9.38.3. Class III - POL.
   9.38.4. Class IV - Fortification materials (sandbags, etc.).
   9.38.5. Class V - Ammunition (include the type):
       9.38.5.1. Type "A" - Small arms.
       9.38.5.2. Type "B" - Mortars.
       9.38.5.3. Type "C" - Artillery.
   9.38.6. Class VI - Civil relief supplies.
9.39. Inflight Rigging Procedures. During joint operations, and unilateral training, inflight
rigging may be necessary. Inflight rigging is a safe procedure if accomplished under a controlled
situation. Accomplish inflight rigging only when the safety of the personnel required to be
mobile in the cargo compartment is not jeopardized. The aircraft may have to change altitude.
Use the DD Form 1748 to complete inflight rigging.
9.40. Protective Headgear.
   9.40.1. The LM and any other personnel required to be mobile in the cargo compartment
   will wear helmets during aerial deliveries utilizing the aircraft overhead anchor cable. The
   flight helmet will be worn with the chinstrap fastened from the first warning until the aerial
   delivery is complete and the cargo compartment is secure. Lower helmet visors if possible.
WARNING: Loadmasters will not position themselves directly under the anchor cable supports
during personnel/equipment airdrops requiring the use of the anchor cable.
   9.40.2. After acknowledgment of the twenty-minute warning, the LM may clear off
   interphone, with aircraft commander approval, to facilitate movement.
   9.40.3. Personnel in the cargo compartment not actively participating in the aerial delivery
   are not required to wear helmets. However, they will remain seated with seat belts fastened
   from the first warning until the aerial delivery is complete and the cargo compartment is
   secure.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      71


9.41. Safety Device.
   9.41.1. Crew members will wear a restraint device when performing duties near an open exit
   inflight. Fit the restraint device and adjust the lifeline prior to flight. Connect the hook to a
   point that will preclude the wearer exiting the aircraft. The strap will not be connected to an
   anchor cable that has static lines attached to it for an airdrop.
   9.41.2. Disconnect the hook, roll, and secure the lifeline to the restraint device after the
   lifeline has been adjusted.
   9.41.3. Connect the lifeline when anticipating movement near an open exit.
   9.41.4. Other personnel required to be mobile in the cargo compartment, as determined by
   the mission/aircraft commander, will normally provide their own restraint device/parachute.
9.42. Aerial Delivery Airspeeds. Recommended aerial delivery airspeeds are a function of the
force required to inflate the parachute to minimize damage to the airdropped object. When the
mission requires other than the recommended airspeed, ensure airspeed falls within the parachute
range listed below.

9.43. Aerial Delivery Altitudes. Altitudes listed in Table 9.3 are the minimum altitudes above
the highest point on the drop zone AGL. Commanders may agree to higher altitudes. For
combination drops, the load requiring the highest drop altitude determines the drop altitude.
Airdrops at or above 3,000 feet AGL will be conducted with high-altitude parachutes, either high
velocity ring slot or high-altitude high/low-opening (HAHO/HALO). Minimum altitudes shown
are intended to provide guidance and not restrict the Army/Air Force commanders in their
planning of combat airdrop missions. Altitudes are based on the technical design characteristics
of the parachutes and represent the minimum at which the parachutes may be expected to
perform their intended function with acceptable reliability. Use of lower altitudes than shown
may result in the parachute(s) failing to achieve their design performance/reliability and
introduce safety hazards to jump personnel or result in unacceptable damage to loads.

                               NAVIGATOR PROCEDURES

11.1. General.
   11.1.1. Flight Operations. If augmented by a navigator, use navigation procedures
   prescribed by this instruction. This chapter details navigator procedures during non-tactical
   flight.
11.2. General Mission Planning.
   11.2.1. Regardless of whether a flight plan is prepared by the aircrew or is furnished by
   another agency, the aircraft commander and navigator will jointly verify routing, altitudes,
   and fuel load prior to departure. On overseas flights, verify the flight planned routing against
   the diplomatic clearance, if applicable. Navigator crew changes (engine running offload or
   augmented crews) will include, as a minimum, a briefing on equipment status.
   11.2.2. Category I Routes. Accomplish flight planning manually or an approved computer
   flight plan (CFP). Compute fuel requirements using aircraft fuel analysis procedures, as
   applicable.
   11.2.3. Category II Routes. Use the AF Form 70, Pilots Flight Plan and Flight Log, or a
   computer flight plan (CFP). Compute required fuel using the approved CFP fuel analysis
   procedures, or IAW aircraft flight manual (not required in the local area).
11.3. Computer Flight Planning (CFP). As with any computer generated mission-planning
product, the aircrew is always responsible for accuracy of data used inflight. Computer flight
plans will be verified for correctness prior to flight.
   11.3.1. HIGHEST ACC FL. The highest cruise altitude or ceiling achieved using the
   planned climb profile based on planned takeoff gross weight, and without regard to ATC
   requirements for direction of flight. When passengers are carried and oxygen is not available
   to them, the HIGHEST ACC FL will not exceed FL250. Enter the flight level to the nearest
   100 feet.
   11.3.2. ENDURANCE. Flying time based on fuel available at takeoff. It is extracted from
   the appropriate fuel planning document or performance manual for the planned constant
   altitude, forecast temperature deviation, and the aircraft gross weight at takeoff.
11.4. Flight Charts. Maintain a plotting chart showing flight progress on all Category I routes.
   11.4.1. Show the following items on the chart:
       11.4.1.1. Navigator's name and coordinated universal date. Chart number, and chart
       edition will be annotated on a stripped chart. Check the CHUM on all charts. For low-
       level flight charts, annotate current CHUM date on the chart. It is not required to
       annotate CHUM information on high-level charts.
       11.4.1.2. Flight plan course line and waypoints (if not pre-labeled) will be annotated with
       waypoint number, identifier, radial and Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), or
       latitude and longitude.
 76                                                     AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013


       11.4.1.3. Annotate suitable emergency airfields. Consider the following factors when
       selecting emergency airfields: type aircraft, weather conditions, runway length, runway
       weight-bearing capacity, runway lighting, radio navigational aids, and proximity to
       planned flight path.
       11.4.1.4. Portions of ADIZ/Flight Information Regions (FIR) boundaries (if not depicted
       accurately) pertinent to the route. Place the applicable portion of the "No Fly" line on all
       charts used for missions flown in the vicinity of unfriendly territory. Prominently mark
       warning and restricted areas within 25 nm of planned course and 3,000 feet of planned
       altitude on the chart (not required if a FLIP en route chart with this information is
       immediately available and used).
   11.4.2. Plot each fix or position along with the time at that position. Fixes or positions may
   be numbered and the corresponding numbers entered in the position column of the log
   instead of the geographical coordinates or descriptive position.
   11.4.3. In the interest of conservation, reuse flight charts for high-level missions whenever
   this would not affect plotting accuracy of fixes or position determination.
11.5. Inflight Procedures.
   11.5.1. Monitor the primary command radio unless otherwise directed by the aircraft
   commander. Record ATC clearances and monitor the read back. This includes all ATC
   instructions during departure, en route, and approach. This procedure is not required when
   ATC instructions require immediate execution by the pilot, or when such action interferes
   with the timely performance of other time-sensitive navigator duties.
   11.5.2. Departure and Approach Monitoring. Immediately after takeoff, crosscheck
   available flight instruments with the airborne radar to ensure the aircraft remains clear of
   obstructions. During departure and arrival in IMC with airborne radar inoperative, use all
   available navigation aids to accurately position the aircraft. On all departures and arrivals,
   have the appropriate approach plate open to monitor course, timing, and altitude. Backup the
   pilots and assist as necessary. Report any deviations immediately. Assist in clearing for
   other aircraft when possible. Confine activities to these critical duties during all departures
   and arrivals.
   11.5.3. Flight Following. For Category I routes, use suitable plotting charts (JNC, or GNC).
   On flights along airways or Category II routes, use applicable charts or sectionals for radar
   flight following. Use a CHUM’ed terrain chart (ONC, TPC, or JOG) depicting all terrain in
   the departure/arrival terminal area (within 25 nm of the airfield).
   11.5.4. On all flights, except tactical or pilot proficiency flights, compute a true air speed
   (TAS) check within 1 hour after reaching the initial cruise altitude.
   11.5.5. On Category I routes or route segments, time between recorded fixes/positions will
   not exceed 1 hour. Note: Immediately report malfunctions or loss of navigational capability
   that will degrade course centerline accuracy to ATC.
   11.5.6. On Category I routes, when the time between the last suitable airfield (LSAF) and
   first suitable airfield (FSAF) is considerable, the following procedures are recommended:
   wind factors, ETP calculations, and inflight fuel management.
AFSOCI11-219V3 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                77


   11.5.7. Heading deviation checks are not required on Category II routes or tactical routes.
   Exception: A deviation check is not required on flights transiting Category I routes of less
   than three hours if the aircraft is equipped with two or more operable heading systems (the
   standby compass is not considered a system for this requirement). Accomplish IAW aircraft
   flight manual.
11.6. Flight Records Completion (AF Form 4116, Computer Flight Plan). Flight progress
will be recorded for Category I route segments of three hours or longer. This form will consist
of planning and inflight progress/proposed data, and will be completed in sufficient detail to
fully evaluate or reconstruct the flight. The procedures below are general in nature and designed
to accommodate a wide range of aircraft navigation equipment configurations. Note: When
flying designated Category II portions of the route, no log is required. ETA/ATA blocks on the
flight plan portion satisfy log requirements.
   11.6.1. REMARKS. Use the REMARKS column to record pertinent information and events
   along with times of the events. Remarks will include, but not be limited to, clearances,
   equipment malfunctions, computer updates, navigator changeovers, and alter headings. Alter
   headings may be individually plotted or averaged to obtain dead reckoning (DR) positions.
   11.6.2. CLEARANCES/REMARKS. When practical, record assigned ATC frequencies on
   departure and approach in this section. Use this section to record other pertinent flight
   information as required.
   11.6.3. NAV AID DATA. Use this section to record actual and corrected readings, if
   applicable. Compare Doppler, INS, Mission Computer (MC), and GPS positions (latitude
   and longitude, or distance-to-go and cross track) for each position fix. At a minimum, record
   the integrated navigation solution. If a navigation solution is updated, record its incorrect
   position and show that it was updated (in the remarks section). Fix data substantiated by
   International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) identifier or coordinates in the position
   block on the actual side of the AF Form 4116 need not be duplicated in this section.
