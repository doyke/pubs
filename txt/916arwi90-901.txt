1. Overview:
   1.1. General.
       1.1.1. This document is intended to provide the strategic plan for the implementation and
       sustainment of Operational Risk Management (ORM) in the 916th Air Refueling Wing.
       ORM initiatives include training, tools and information, application to mission activity,
       integration, and oversight. These initiatives will be refined, enhanced, and updated as
       ORM integration matures, experience is gained, and mission needs change the
       sustainment focus.
   1.2. Resources.
 2                                                        916ARWI90-901 5 OCTOBER 2011


        1.2.1. All resources required to implement and sustain ORM for units within the 916
        ARW will be provided by the unit.
     1.3. Financial Requirements.
        1.3.1. Current Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding is expected to be sufficient to
        support implementation and integration of ORM into 916 ARW activities. The only
        significant future expense is funding to train replacement ORM advisors in the event of
        reassignments. This expense is limited to travel and per diem for one week to Kirtland
        AFB, NM or alternate venue approved by AFRC.
     1.4. Manpower Requirements.
        1.4.1. Each group within the wing will appoint an ORM program advisor to oversee the
        implementation and sustainment of ORM for all units within the respective group.
        Additional duty personnel will support the wing and group ORM programs in the form of
        functional area specific ORM advisors and safety representatives. Supervisors will ensure
        assigned personnel apply ORM to all applicable mission-related activities.
2. Introduction.
     2.1. Purpose
        2.1.1. The purpose of this plan is to implement requirements identified in AFPD 90-9,
        paragraph 5.5.
     2.2. Vision
        2.2.1. Ensure an organization in which all personnel manage risk so that operations are
        successfully completed in the most mission effective manner possible.
     2.3. Mission
        2.3.1. Enhance mission effectiveness while minimizing risk.
     2.4. Goals

           training, periodic ORM-related briefings as determined by the commander, on-the-job
           training, and participation in application of ORM to mission activities.
              3.2.2.1.1. Introduction to ORM Training. Supervisors are responsible to ensure
              all personnel receive this training and that the training is documented. Initial
              ORM training shall be conducted as part of each unit’s newcomer’s training when
              a member is assigned to the 916 ARW.
              3.2.2.1.2. Initial Workplace ORM Training. Supervisors are responsible to ensure
              all personnel receive this training and that the training is documented. Initial
              workplace training will consist of including the new member in a shop level ORM
              process as soon as possible.
              3.2.2.1.3. ORM Related Activities.
                  3.2.2.1.3.1. Headquarters (HQ) Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) may
                  schedule ORM-down days on a periodic basis. These days will be fully
                  supported by all personnel, including unit safety representatives and ORM
                  advisors.
                  3.2.2.1.3.2. ORM related briefings may be provided to unit personnel as a
                  part of Commander’s Calls. These briefings may be presented as Air Force or
                  HQ AMC/AFRC video presentations or as briefings by the group/unit ORM
                  advisor, wing ORM Program Manager, or unit safety representatives.
              3.2.2.1.4. On-the-Job Training. Personnel at every level will work with their
              supervisors and the group/unit ORM advisor to learn wing and unit procedures for
              applying ORM to tasked activities.
              3.2.2.1.5. Participation in ORM-Related Mission Activity. Project managers and
              team members will employ the wing process for managing risk associated with
              mission-related activity for all projects, with the assistance of the group/unit ORM
              advisor.
              3.2.2.1.6. The material can also be downloaded from the AFRC ORM Home
              Page via the AFRC Safety Home Page: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
              af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC134BF30FB5E044080020
              E329A9
           3.2.2.2. Advisor. Advisor level training includes participation in all basic level
           activities and attending the Air Force ORM Applications and Integration Course, at
           the Air Force Safety Center, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico or an alternate venue
           approved by AFRC.
    3.3. Objective 2. Provide tools and information to enable ORM use.
       3.3.1. Introduction. Providing the tools and information necessary for assigned personnel
       to apply ORM to mission activities is essential to successful implementation of ORM in
       the wing. The tools and information required will be provided in two ways: Web-based
       products and personal contact.
           3.3.1.1. Web-based Products. The latest web-based information in support of ORM is
           available from the AFRC ORM site. This information is accessible from mil-only
916ARWI90-901 5 OCTOBER 2011                                                                    5


         sites.                                        https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
         af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC134BF30FB5E044080020E32
         9A9
         3.3.1.2. Personal Contact. Despite the best of training and web-based products,
         personal contact remains a staple of doing business. Wing members are encouraged to
         discuss any ORM related topic with the group/unit ORM advisor or safety
         representatives.
     3.3.2. Implementation and Responsibilities.
         3.3.2.1. Web-Based Products. The wing ORM Program Manager will maintain a
         supply of ORM tools and regulations available via the public folders to allow
         assigned personnel ready access to essential ORM requirements and supporting
         documentation. Group/unit ORM advisors will also develop procedures for providing
         this material to units within the respective groups.
         3.3.2.2. Personal Contact. Contact information for the ORM advisor will be provided
         on unit additional-duty rosters. The group/unit ORM advisors will make themselves
         available to assist, train, and guide personnel in their ORM activities.
  3.4. Objective 3. Integrate ORM into all mission-related activities.
     3.4.1. Introduction. Employing ORM in the conduct of mission-related activity is the key
     focus of ORM policy and guidance.
     3.4.2. Implementation and Responsibilities.
         3.4.2.1. Planning Activity. The 916 ARW ORM Program Manager will conduct
         ORM Council Meetings quarterly (at a minimum semi-annually). All ORM unit level
         advisors are encouraged to attend. ORM Council Meetings will be used to provide
         recurrent ORM training to unit ORM advisors and discuss activities/mission the wing
         will be conducting that could increase risk. Individual units will routinely apply
         ORM into their planning activities. The wing ORM Council Meetings should serve
         as a template for units to follow. All identified hazards and controls will be identified
         and integrated into the planned activity. In addition, the risk analysis will be reviewed
         by unit or group commanders before being briefed to the appropriate commander.
         Risks that cannot be reduced to an acceptable level will be identified to the
         commanders to enable an informed decision regarding the level of risk.
         3.4.2.2. During Execution. Throughout the execution of any project or procedure,
         units will implement risk controls identified in planning and observe their
         effectiveness. Inadequate risk controls will be cause for delaying operations until
         adequate risk controls can be employed or an informed decision by the appropriate
         commander is provided. Lessons learned will be noted for future use.
         3.4.2.3. Post Mission Activity. Once after-action reports are published, units will
         forward ORM lessons learned to the group/unit ORM advisor so the process for
         applying ORM can be updated.
  3.5. Objective 4. Continuously improve wing ORM processes, products, and policies.

       3.5.1. Introduction. Continuous improvement of ORM processes is essential to keep
       abreast of the mounting complexity of hazards to mission activity.
       3.5.2. Implementation and Responsibilities.
           3.5.2.1. ORM Processes. All units will note any difficulty or inadequacy in any unit
           ORM process and identify their observations and recommended fixes to the ORM
           advisor.
           3.5.2.2. ORM Products. Wing personnel will note any difficulty or inadequacy in
           unit ORM products and identify their observations and recommended fixes to the
           group/unit ORM advisor.
           3.5.2.3. ORM Policies. Wing personnel will note any difficulty or inadequacy in unit
           ORM policy and identify their observations and recommended fixes to the group/unit
           ORM advisor.
    3.6. Objective 5. Encourage off-duty application of ORM.
       3.6.1. Introduction. Application of ORM by Air Force personnel to off-duty activities is
       identified at Air Force level as an essential part of any unit ORM program.
       3.6.2. Implementation and Responsibilities.
           3.6.2.1. ORM Down Days. During all safety or ORM down-day activities,
           application of ORM to off-duty activities will be included as a part of the day’s
           activities.
           3.6.2.2. ORM Briefings. Application of ORM to off-duty activities will be included
           as a part of Commander’s call ORM briefings.
    3.7. Objective 6. Provide ORM program oversight.
       3.7.1. Introduction. Commander ownership of ORM activities is essential to ensure
       ORM is employed and becomes an integral part of all mission activity.
       3.7.2. Implementation and Responsibilities. On an annual basis, the wing ORM manager
       and group commanders will review this instruction for currency and completeness.
