SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been revised to establish a new OPR, to streamline procedures and to
incorporate a USAFA Events Program SharePoint site to facilitate program management.
1. PURPOSE. This instruction defines the different types of events taking place on USAFA,
provides the process for submitting events for approval and clarifies responsibilities of USAFA
organizations.
2. SUMMARY. USAFA and local community organizations frequently request to hold a wide
variety of events on this installation. These requests include concerts, sporting competitions,
 2                                                       USAFAI36-3525 24 OCTOBER 2013


civic events, fund-raising events, educational programs, special observances, lectures, memorial
services, non-profit activities and conferences/meetings. Many of these requests are for
recurring events hosted by USAFA organizations primarily for USAFA personnel or cadets.
Others may be requested by external organizations for non-DOD personnel.
3. DEFINITIONS.
     3.1. EVENT. A social event, official function or type of activity which may involve special
     interest groups, a large number of off-base, non-DoD personnel, the need for parking
     deconfliction, Distinguished Visitors (DVs) or significant or unusual support from the
     Head Quarters 10th Air Base Wing (HQ 10 ABW) or other USAFA organizations. All
     events must comply with current security postures at USAFA, to include entry-access list
     (EAL) requirements. Event sponsors and action officers (AO) must recognize that real-
     world security issues have the potential to require curtailment or cancellation of an
     event with short notice. A comprehensive listing of approved events is available at the
     USAFA                 Events              Program               SharePoint             site:
     https://eis.usafa.edu/centers/events/SitePages/Home.aspx.
        3.1.1. External Events. Events requested by an outside agency requiring use of USAFA
        facilities, grounds or personnel, which do not directly support the
        Academy mission.
        3.1.2. Internal Events.     Events sponsored, hosted and supported by USAFA
        organizations for USAFA personnel or cadets as part of their mission/responsibility, with
        the exception of institutional events (listed in para 3.1.2.1). These events will be
        coordinated by a staff package (e-SSS) and a USAFA Form 29, United States Air Force
        Academy Event Application, submitted by the host organization through each USAFA
        organization from which support is requested. The sponsor/AO must coordinate within
        their Mission Element (ME) to ensure continuity/approval. If ME’s determine that
        support outside the organization is needed then the organization will meet with the
        USAFA Events Program Committee for approval/coordination. Approving official(s) for
        these events include the Superintendent/Vice Superintendent, Air Base Wing
        Commander, Commandant, Dean, Athletic Director, and the Preparatory
        School Commander.
            3.1.2.1. Institutional Events. (Internal Event Exceptions): Recurring Institutional
            Events such as USAFA/Prep School Graduations; Parents Weekend; Intercollegiate
            Sporting Events; Board of Visitor (BOV) meetings; Conference of Service Academy
            Superintendents (COSAS); CORONA; Reunions and Homecoming; In-Processing of
            USAFA Appointees; Cadet Wing Parades and the National Character Leadership
            Symposium (NCLS) do not require committee approval due to the USAFA Plans
            and/or instructions already designated to them.
            3.1.2.2. Sponsors or AOs/OPRs for the above “exceptions” are responsible for
            contacting      the    USAFA       Events     Program       Manager       at
            10abw.xp.usafaeventsprogram@us.af.mil to ensure the event is placed on the
            USAFA Events Program Calendar.
        3.1.3. Venue Activities. Activities that are within the normal function of a particular
        venue include: Arnold Hall Theater/Ballroom events; Association of Graduates (AOG)
USAFAI36-3525 24 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 3


       Doolittle Hall (meetings, conferences or banquets); Cadet Chapel Weddings and
       Funerals; Falcon Club events; Health and Wellness Center (HAWC) or Fitness Center
       events; Press Box events and Fairchild Hall Falcon Center and McDermott Library
       events. Each venue has its own requirements and process for hosting or supporting
       activities. Venue activities do not typically have to go through the events committee.
       Exceptions requiring committee approval include large-scale events that have significant
       security or support requirements, events inside the cadet area and events likely to
       generate senior-leader interest. Sponsors, AOs and requestors are responsible for
       contacting        the        USAFA         Events       Program       Manager         at
       10abw.xp.usafaeventsprogram@us.af.mil to ensure the event is placed on the USAFA
       Events Program Calendar. A comprehensive list of USAFA Facilities and POCs is
       available at https://eis.usafa.edu/centers/events/SitePages/Home.aspx.
   3.2. USAFA Events Program Calendar. Head Quarters 10th Air Base Wing Plans and
   Programs
   (HQ 10 ABW/XP) maintains a comprehensive USAFA Events Program Calendar at
   https://eis.usafa.edu/centers/events/SitePages/Home.aspx. Sponsors, AOs and event
   requestors are responsible for contacting the USAFA Events Program Manager at
   10abw.xp.usafaeventsprogram@us.af.mil to ensure their event is placed on the USAFA
   Events Program Calendar.
   3.3. USAFA         Master      Calendar.           The     USAFA      Master     Calendar
   https://eis.usafa.edu/hq/default.aspx contains leave and TDYs for ME leadership as well as
   major events involving multiple MEs and sensitive areas involving DVs or special interest
   groups. To add an event to the USAFA Master Calendar, sponsors or AOs must submit the
   request to their ME designated calendar coordinator. The USAFA Events Program Manager
   will ensure applicable external events are placed on the USAFA Master Calendar. Questions
   regarding the USAFA Master Calendar should be directed to HQ USAFA/CCEA.
4. MISSION. To provide a means for all organizations and event planners to be aware of
events held at USAFA and define the process and procedures to request, approve, coordinate and
deconflict these events.
5. EXECUTION.
   5.1. Concept of Operations. This instruction discusses and describes responsibilities for
   coordinating and gaining approval for events held at USAFA. It is not intended to be a
   replacement for proper internal vetting, coordinated support requests or calendar posting(s).
   Ultimately, each ME is responsible for its own events and determining which events require
   senior level approval and placement on the USAFA Events Program Calendar IAW this
   Instruction and/or the USAFA Master Calendar IAW the USAFA Action Officer & Staffing
   Guide published by HQ USAFA/CCEA. Event sponsors and AOs will contact MEs, base
   agencies and venues to pre-coordinate events and support.
   5.2. Internal/External Event Approval Process.
       5.2.1. To Request an External Event, Requestors must:
          5.2.1.1. Obtain a USAFA sponsor for the proposed event. Event sponsors must be a
          military member assigned to USAFA, or a civilian employed at USAFA or the AOG.
          Sponsors will assist requestors with processing, planning, coordinating and executing
4                                                     USAFAI36-3525 24 OCTOBER 2013


       their event. All requests will be reviewed for legal, financial, environmental,
       safety/security and protocol impact.
       5.2.1.2. Ensure a suitable facility/venue is available. A comprehensive list of
       USAFA          Facilities    and      their      POCs       is     available     at
       https://eis.usafa.edu/centers/events/SitePages/Home.aspx. The event approval
       process provides back-up deconfliction, but the event committee members do not
       contact the facility managers or coordinate the event with the facility. Requestors
       should ask that their event be “penciled in” with the facility manager prior to
       submitting an external event request, to reserve the space should event approval be
       granted.       If event approval cannot be granted, please notify the
       facility manager.
       5.2.1.3. In most cases, venue managers will require the use of the USAFA Form 117,
       Request for Short-Term Facility Use. This form establishes insurance requirements
       and notifies the requestor that they may be responsible for reimbursable costs that
       USAFA incurs for use of the facility. The USAFA Form 117 is available at Error!
       Hyperlink reference not valid..
       5.2.1.4. Submit a USAFA Form 29, United States Air Force Academy Event
       Application, for each event. All sections must be completed on the form and a draft
       sequence of events must be included. Submit the form via e-mail to the USAFA
       Events Program Manager at 10abw.xp.usafaeventsprogram@us.af.mil no later than
       90 days prior to event date. The USAFA Form 29 is available at http://static.e-
       publishing.af.mil/production/1/usafa/form/usafa29/usafa29.xfdl.
       5.2.1.5. If the event is to be held outside of a developed area and/or involve ground-
       disturbing activities, including camping or parking in areas not normally used for
       parking, an AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, should be
       submitted to 10 CES. Contact 10 CES Environmental Planner for questions. AF
       Form            813            is         available          at         http://static.e-
       publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a4_7/form/af813/af813.xfd.
       5.2.1.6. Verify the event is approved prior to committing any resources to support the
       event. Prior to releasing any publicity of the event, ensure there is no implied DoD or
       USAFA endorsement of the event, the organization or its purpose. Committee
       approval of publicity will be required.
       5.2.1.7. Coordinate with the staff of USAFA senior leaders for their participation or
       attendance at an event. A request for senior leadership involvement is not a guarantee
       of their participation. Sponsors should ensure events are “penciled in” on each
       applicable senior leader’s calendar pending approval and ensure a formal invitation is
       sent to the respective staff of the participating senior leader.
       5.2.1.8. Short notice events and change requests submitted less than 90 days prior to
       the event will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Such events or change requests
       may be disapproved, particularly if the event requires extensive coordination or
       support.
    5.2.2. USAFA Sponsors of External Events must:
USAFAI36-3525 24 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   5


        5.2.2.1. Assist requestors in processing, planning, coordinating and executing their
        event.
        5.2.2.2. Assist requestors in submitting their event request. Perform initial
        coordination of the event to include contacting the facility POC for availability.
        Review organizational calendars and the USAFA Events Program Calendar to
        deconflict the event with other previously scheduled events.
        5.2.2.3. Submit support request form(s) (i.e., facilities usage, transportation, security)
        to applicable organization(s). Follow-up to ensure support is available.
        5.2.2.4. Notify Protocol (HQ USAFA/CCP) if DVs or senior staff are requested to
        attend. It is the sponsor’s responsibility to confirm availability and ensure HQ
        USAFA/CCP has specific information to track DV visibility. Sponsors must request
        the event be “penciled in” on the commander’s calendar and follow-up prior to event
        to ensure that the individual is still available to attend or participate.
        5.2.2.5. Notify all support agencies and the USAFA Events Program Manager at
        10abw.xp.usafaeventsprogram@us.af.mil if any changes are made to the planning
        or execution of the event.
        5.2.2.6. Comply with USAFAI 51-902, Fundraising and On-Base Solicitation.
        Fundraiser requests during the Combined Federal Campaign (1 Sep – 15 Dec) or Air
        Force Assistance Fund Campaign (Feb – May) must be approved by HQ 10
        ABW/CC. A separate staff package must be submitted at least four weeks in advance
        of the event.
     5.2.3. External Event Deconfliction and Approval. Event deconfliction and approval is
     accomplished through the Events Committee. The committee generally meets on a
     monthly basis or when required, and is scheduled by the USAFA Events Program
     Manager. Events Committee members will discuss events and approve, disapprove or
     table them for future discussion. Sponsors or requestors may request, or be asked, to be
     present at the meeting to discuss their events.
     5.2.4. Events Committee. The USAFA Events Program Committee is comprised of
     representatives from:
        5.2.4.1. The HQ 10 ABW, specifically:

       it will be forwarded to the USAFA Events Committee members.
       5.2.5.2. Committee members will deconflict within their ME and review for safety,
       mission priorities and resources available, depending on unit focus.
       5.2.5.3. The requestor and/or sponsor will be scheduled to present their event at an
       upcoming USAFA Events Program Committee meeting to determine if the event will
       be “approved,” “disapproved” or “tabled.” All “disapproved” and “tabled” decisions
       require comments that explain the decision. The USAFA Events Program Manager
       will obtain the committee’s consensus for any “tabled” or “disapproved” events.
       5.2.5.4. Each committee member will be directed to a Read-Ahead package before
       each scheduled USAFA Events Program Committee meeting. All USAFA Form 29’s
       and          related       documents        can       be       found        at

    consider the following eight requirements from the Joint Ethics Regulation:
           5.2.5.5.1. The support requested does not interfere with the performance of
           official duties and would in no way detract from readiness.
           5.2.5.5.2. DoD community relations with the immediate community and/or other
USAFAI36-3525 24 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 7


           legitimate DoD public affairs or military training interests are served by the
           support.
        5.2.5.5.3. It is appropriate to associate the DoD, including the United States Air
        Force Academy, with the event.
           5.2.5.5.4. The event is of interest and benefit to the local civilian community,
           USAFA or any other part of DoD.
           5.2.5.5.5. The USAFA is able and willing to provide the same support to
           comparable events that are sponsored by other similar non-federal entities. For
           clarification, each ME or squadron should consider this requirement.
           5.2.5.5.6. The use of support for the event is not restricted by other statutes (see
           10 U.S.C. 2012) which limit support that is not based on customary community
           relations or public affairs activities or regulations.
           5.2.5.5.7. No admission fee (beyond what will cover the reasonable costs of
           sponsoring the event) is charged for the event, or the portion of the event
           supported by DoD, or DoD support to the event is incidental to the entire event in
           accordance with public affairs guidance.
           5.2.5.5.8. Fundraisers.
               5.2.5.5.8.1. DoD employees shall not officially endorse or appear to endorse
               membership drives or fundraising for any non-Federal entity except for the
               organizations listed in paragraph
               3-210(a) of the JER.
               5.2.5.5.8.2. USAFA, through the Events Committee Chair, may provide, on a
               limited basis, the use of USAFA facilities and equipment (and the services of
               USAFA employees necessary to make proper use of equipment), as logistical
               support of a charitable fundraising event sponsored by a non-Federal entity
               when the head Chair of the Events Committee determines paragraph 5.2.5.5.1.
               through 5.2.5.5.8. of this instruction apply, and the sponsoring non-Federal
               entity is not affiliated with the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) (including
               local CFC) or, if affiliated with the CFC, the Director, OPM, or designee, has
               no objection to USAFA support of the event. OPM has no objection to support
               of events that do not fundraise on the Federal Government workplace.
        5.2.5.6. Approved Events: Once processed through the Events Committee, the
        USAFA Events Program Manager will prepare correspondence for the Chair of the
        Events                                                                   Committee
        (HQ 10 MSG/CC) to sign and notify the sponsor and requestor. Event Approval
        Numbers will no longer be required or used in this program. Meeting Minutes will be

6. EVENTS SCHEDULING BLACKOUT. The USAFA mission necessitates that during
certain times, events are at increased risk for disapproval due to maximum commitment of
USAFA’s support resources elsewhere. Requesters/sponsors should avoid scheduling events
during the following institutional/military proceedings since most USAFA agencies will be
heavily tasked with planning and execution. Events incurring blackout dates are:
   6.1. Preparatory School Graduation (mid-May)
   6.2. Cadet Graduation (typically week which includes Memorial Day weekend)
   6.3. Cadet In-processing (end of June or beginning of July)
   6.4. Parents Weekend (Labor Day weekend)
   6.5. CORONA Conference (during home Service Academy football game, early Oct/Nov)
   6.6. Board of Visitors meetings (usually twice annually)
