Section 1B—Additional Guidance

1.7. Character of Discharge. Character of discharge doesn’t apply to officers dismissed by
court martial or dropped from the rolls of the Air Force. Although the character of discharge
normally is based on a pattern of behavior or duty performance or both, there are circumstances
in which a single incident of misconduct or substandard duty performance may provide the basis
for the character of discharge. The three types of character of discharge that the SAF may direct
are:
   1.7.1. An Honorable Discharge. This is the highest type of character of discharge.
       1.7.1.1. An honorable or under honorable conditions (general) discharge may be directed
       when the basis for discharge is Chapter 2, Section 2A of this AFI, or AFI 36-3206,
       Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers, chapter 2.
       1.7.1.2. The SAF normally directs an honorable discharge when the basis for discharge
       pertains solely to precommissioning activities and is under AFI 36-3206, chapter 3.
       EXCEPTION: The SAF may direct a discharge UOTHC or a discharge under honorable
       conditions (general) if an officer intentionally misrepresented or omitted facts in official
       statements, records, or commissioning documents.
   1.7.2. An Under Honorable Conditions (General) Discharge. The SAF may direct, as a rule,
   this type of character of discharge if the military record is not sufficiently meritorious to
   warrant an honorable discharge but doesn’t warrant a discharge under other than honorable
   conditions.
   1.7.3. A Discharge Under Other Than Honorable Conditions (UOTHC). The SAF will, as a
   rule, direct a discharge UOTHC if the military record doesn’t warrant an under honorable
   conditions (general) discharge.
   1.7.4. DELETED.
       1.7.4.1. DELETED.
           1.7.4.1.1. DELETED.
AFI36-3207 9 JULY 2004                                                                           11

           1.7.4.1.7. DELETED.
       1.7.4.2. DELETED.
1.8. Future Veterans" Rights and Benefits--Reentering the Service. The Department of
Veterans" Affairs determines the rights and benefits of a former officer under 38 U.S.C. An
honorable discharge doesn't guarantee a former officer reentry into the Service. A discharge
under honorable conditions (general) normally rules out former officer's reentry. An officer loses
eligibility for reentry when discharged under other than honorable conditions.

Section 1C—Keeping Officers on Active Duty

1.9. Extending Active Duty for Pregnancy or Family Member's Medical Care.
   1.9.1. The SAF or his or her designee may extend DOS for pregnant officers or officers with
   pregnant spouses when they won't qualify for Government medical care after their current
   DOS. Officers must submit requests for extended DOS by the 6th month of pregnancy. They
   also must submit a certificate of pregnancy from the attending physician with an expected
   date of confinement (EDC). The extension period consists of the delivery date plus 1 month.
   EXCEPTION: A competent medical authority may recommend a longer extension.
   1.9.2. When a doctor confirms that a family member's illness or injury constitutes a threat to
   life or would cause severe financial hardship if the officer lost military medical benefits the
   officer may submit a request for an extension at any time. The officer must submit a
   certificate from the attending physician validating the seriousness of the illness or injury, the
   prognosis, and the estimated date of recovery. The extension consists of the number of
   months required to resolve the medical condition or associated problems. The extension can't
   exceed 12 months.
   1.9.3. Wing commanders or other authorities:
       1.9.3.1. Indorse the request for extension.
       1.9.3.2. Recommend approval or disapproval.
       1.9.3.3. State whether they can employ the officer.
       1.9.3.4. Return requests to MPFs.
   1.9.4. MPFs forward requests to HQ AFPC/DPPRSO.
   1.9.5. Officers may separate early when pregnancy ends in other than live birth or the family
   member's illness or injury no longer requires military medical care.
   1.9.6. Commanders may not authorize early separation for pregnancies that end in other than
   live birth scheduled to occur before the original DOS.
12                                                                   AFI36-3207 9 JULY 2004

subject to trial by court-martial. (See Attachment 15.) NOTE: Commanders should not
recommend that the SAF accept resignation for the good of the service for purposes solely of
expediency, when the member’s conduct would be more appropriately processed under the
UCMJ. Before making any recommendations, commanders at all levels must consider the best
interest of the Air Force and the effect a resignation accepted by SAF will have on good order
and discipline in the Air Force. The expense of a court-martial should rarely be the deciding
factor in making a recommendation on a tendered resignation under this paragraph. To permit
AFI36-3207 9 JULY 2004                                                                         25

   MAJCOM of assignment. EXCEPTION: The general court-martial convening authority or
   any level of command between the convening authority and the MAJCOM may decline the
   resignation and return it to the officer if charges have not been referred to trial by court-
   martial.
   2.22.3. The MAJCOM of assignment indorses the resignation and refers it to HQ

Section 2D—Conditional Waiver of Board Hearing

2.29. Options Explained. A conditional waiver is a statement made by an officer who gives up
the rights associated with the administrative discharge board proceeding. The waiver is
contingent on the receipt of a type of separation more favorable than the least favorable
authorized for any basis of separation set forth in the show cause notification memorandum.
Only the type of the characterization of separation is addressed in a conditional waiver.
   2.29.1. For example, in a case based on unsatisfactory performance, the least favorable
   service characterization is under honorable conditions (General). The conditional waiver
   would ask for an honorable discharge. In a misconduct case, the officer could be discharged
   with an under other than honorable conditions characterization of service. The waiver might
AFI36-3207 9 JULY 2004                                                                         27


   be contingent on the receipt of an honorable or a general discharge. It must specify one or the
   other. The waiver may not be conditioned on approval of a discharge for a specific reason.
2.30. Offer by the Officer. The officer submits the conditional waiver to the unit commander
who forwards it to the SCA for review. The officer asks for no less than a specific type of
characterization of discharge (see Attachment 20 for format). The case file considered by the
SCA contains the officer’s request for conditional waiver. and the unit commander’s
recommendation.
2.31. Acceptance or Rejection:
   2.31.1. The SCA may:
       2.31.1.1. Reject the conditional waiver and tell the member that either an unconditional
       waiver must be submitted or a board hearing will be scheduled. If the officer fails to
       respond within 3 workdays or by the end of an approved extension, a board hearing will
       be convened.
       2.31.1.2. Recommend acceptance of the conditional waiver and forward to the
       MAJCOM/CC.
   2.31.2. The MAJCOM/CC may:
       2.31.2.1. Reject the conditional waiver. Discharge processing then continues.
       2.31.2.2. Recommend acceptance of the conditional waiver and send it to HQ
       AFPC/DPPRS.
   2.31.3. The SAF may:
       2.31.3.1. Reject the conditional waiver. Discharge processing then continues.
       2.31.3.2. Accept the conditional waiver and approve the type of separation specified in
       it, or a better type of characterization.
2.32. Withdrawal of a Conditional Waiver. The officer may send a written request for
withdrawal of the conditional waiver through command channels to the SCA. The request must
give the reason for the withdrawal. The SCA approves the withdrawal of waivers not yet referred
to AFPC/DPPRS. OSAF approves or disapproves all other requests for withdrawal of waivers
regardless of the status of the case.
2.33. Action After a Conditional Waiver is Rejected:
   2.33.1. The officer is then taken to a board hearing (AFPB or BOI) or may submit an
   unconditional waiver of a board hearing. If the officer fails to respond within 3 workdays or
   by the end of an approved extension, a board hearing will be convened. For the format of the
   unconditional waiver, see Attachment 21. A second conditional waive will not be accepted.
   2.33.2. Processing continues without reference to, or consideration of, the rejected
   conditional waiver. The fact that a conditional waiver was offered and rejected must not be
   made a part of the record shown to the AFPB or BOI. Conditional waiver will be withdrawn
   from the unit commander’s recommendation for discharge.
 28                                                                AFI36-3207 9 JULY 2004


   2.33.3. After SAF acts on the case, the SCA adds the conditional waiver correspondence to
   the separation file. It will show when the waiver was submitted and when it was rejected.
   This will account for what might seem to be delays in processing.
2.34. Action When a Conditional Waiver is Accepted. The acceptance of a conditional
waiver of the board hearing does not change any other right of the respondent. The conditional
waiver correspondence is part of the case file and stays with it.

   employee witnesses who ap-pear under invitational travel orders to testify for the
   non-probationary reserve officers. The board may not author-ize Government reimbursement
   for witnesses who aren't invited by the recorder.
