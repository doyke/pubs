     6.1. Thunderstorms:
        6.1.1. Thunderstorm activity is likely in the late afternoon during the summer months at USAFA.
        Thunderstorms can be detected by the increase in dark cumulonimbus (storm) clouds.
        6.1.2. The USAFA Command Center (10 ABW/CP) using weather reports obtained from base
        weather as well as information from an Electrical Storm Identification Device (ESID) will monitor
        for increasing thunderstorm activity.
           6.1.2.1. The USAFA Command Center will notify all units in the JVTC of a thunderstorm
           watch. While Global Engagement (GE) and BCT are in operation, the USAFA Command Cen-
           ter will notify the respective command posts. During the rest of the year, notify 34 TRS, unless
           given other instructions from 34 TRS.
           6.1.2.2. The USAFA Command Center will notify all units in the JVTC of thunderstorm
           warnings. The notification will include details known about the thunderstorm (direction of
           travel, speed, whether or not hail is present, wind speed, etc.). While GE and BCT are in oper-
           ation, they will notify the respective command posts. During the rest of the year, notify
           34 TRS, unless given other instructions from 34 TRS. If it is determined there is thunderstorm
           activity within 10 miles of a program, the program will notify USAFA Command Center. At
           this point, the thunderstorm watch will be upgraded to a warning and the other programs will
           be notified.
        6.1.3. Thunderstorms may be accompanied by lightning, heavy rains, high winds, and hail. Heavy
        rains may produce flash floods.
        6.1.4. When a thunderstorm watch is issued, personnel will be assigned as weather spotters. All
        equipment will be secured to minimize the potential for damage and training will continue.
           6.1.4.1. When a thunderstorm warning is issued, all training will stop and personnel will seek
           the shelter determined by their program director. 34 TRS/CC, or designated representative, has
           the authority to override thunderstorm warnings.
     6.2. Tornadoes:
USAFAI91-201 28 MARCH 2005                                                                            13


     6.2.1. Tornadoes along the Front Range usually occur during thunderstorm development. Peak
     months are May-July. Tornadoes are likely to develop when the sky becomes dark green. A wall
     cloud will form. Large hail may occur. A large roar, similar to a freight train, accompanies a tor-
     nado.
     6.2.2. The USAFA Command Center, using weather reports obtained from base weather, will
     monitor tornado watches and warnings.
        6.2.2.1. The USAFA Command Center will notify all units in the JVTC of a tornado watch.
        While GE and BCT are in operation, they will notify the respective command posts. During
        the rest of the year, notify 34 TRS, unless given other instructions from 34 TRS. This will alert
        the units to watch for developing storms and to take initial resource protection steps. The
        USAFA Command Center will also notify base transportation so they can prepare to evacuate
        JVTC.
        6.2.2.2. The USAFA Command Center will notify all units in JVTC of a tornado warning. The
        notification will include all details that are known about the tornado or funnel cloud (direction
        of travel, speed, size, etc.). While GE and BCT are in operation, they will notify the respective
        command posts. During the rest of the year, notify 34 TRS, unless given other instructions
        from 34 TRS. If one of the summer programs spots a funnel cloud or tornado, the program will
        notify the USAFA Command Center. At this point, the tornado watch will be upgraded to a
        warning and all programs will be notified.
     6.2.3. When a tornado watch is issued, personnel will be assigned as weather spotters. Equipment
     will be secured to minimize the potential for damage. Training will continue.
        6.2.3.1. When a tornado warning is issued, all training will cease and personnel will seek the
        shelter determined by their program director.
  6.3. Heat:
     6.3.1. Periods of hot weather cause concerns. As the temperature increases, so does the chance of
     heat related injuries. Heat related injuries include heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.
     The chance of accidental fires also increases.
     6.3.2. Each summer program Officer in Charge (OIC) will monitor the Wet Bulb Globe Temper-
     ature (WGBT). External users will be notified by the USAFA Command Center or 34 TRS. The
     fire department is responsible for monitoring the fire hazard.
        6.3.2.1. Each summer program will be responsible for notifying their personnel in accordance
        with applicable 34th Training Group Operating Instruction 91-501, Cadet Safety Program.
        6.3.2.2. The fire department will notify the USAFA Command Center, and in turn, they will
        notify all units in JVTC when the fire danger is high. While GE and BCT are in operation, the
        USAFA Command Center will notify the respective command posts. During the rest of the
        year, 34 TRS will coordinate all activities that present a fire hazard with the fire department.
        Summer programs will provide the base fire department with a schedule of the activities that
        present a fire hazard. This will include, but is not limited to, all use of pyrotechnics.
     6.3.3. External users will ensure drinking water is readily available to participants. This will be
     arranged for before the training date.
14                                                                   USAFAI91-201 28 MARCH 2005


        6.3.4. When the fire danger is high, training with pyrotechnics may continue after a plan is
        reached with the base fire department and 34 TRS/CC approves.
     6.4. Wind:
        6.4.1. High winds can cause damage to structures and can create a flying debris hazard. During
        periods of cold weather, the wind chill must be considered.
        6.4.2. The USAFA Command Center will monitor wind speed using weather reports obtained
        from base weather.
           6.4.2.1. When the constant wind speed reaches 30 knots, units in JVTC and Saylor Park will
           be notified by the USAFA Command Center. While GE and BCT are in operation, the USAFA
           Command Center will notify the respective command posts. During the rest of the year, notify
           34 TRS unless given other instructions from 34 TRS. The USAFA Command Center will keep
           units updated on the actual and expected wind speed until the wind speed falls below 30 knots.
           6.4.2.2. When the actual temperature is 15 degrees Fahrenheit or lower and the wind speed is
           24 knots or greater, the USAFA Command Center will monitor the wind chill and notify
           34 TRS.
        6.4.3. Ensure all equipment is secured upon notification of high winds. The following applies to
        all users other than the Cadet Wing.
           6.4.3.1. During cold weather, ensure personnel have adequate protective clothing.
           6.4.3.2. When the constant wind speed exceeds 50 knots, terminate all outdoor training. Do
           not use tents for shelter.
           6.4.3.3. When the wind chill reaches –25 degrees Fahrenheit terminate outdoor training.
     6.5. Winter Weather:
        6.5.1. Snow and ice create a very hazardous environment on the courses. Large amounts of snow
        or ice have the potential to close roads.
        6.5.2. The USAFA Command Center, using weather reports obtained from base weather, will
        monitor winter storm watches and warnings. The USAFA Command Center will notify 34 TRS of
        expected snowfall or ice.
        6.5.3. 34 TRS/CC has the authority to cancel training due to inclement weather. Courses will not
        be used when they are wet. Other types of training may continue as long as access to JVTC exists.
        If it looks like the roads will become impassable, all units will evacuate the JVTC.
