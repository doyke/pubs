                            AIRCRAFT PAINT SCORING PROCESS

A3.1. The following process was developed to assess the condition of painted surfaces on
aircraft and to assign priority for paint touch-up according to need. This process involves the
scoring of all assigned aircraft by qualified structural maintenance personnel using a simple point
system.
   A3.1.1. All MacDill assigned aircrafts will be paint scored within a week of arriving on
   station. A one to five point score system will be used to assess the aircraft’s paint condition
   and to determine the amount of work and time required to restore defective areas. Scoring
   will be documented on a paint score worksheet using the area diagrams.
   A3.1.2. Each aircraft will receive a follow-up inspection every 30 days in conjunction with
   the minor CCI and/or return from a deployment. These inspections will be documented on a
   Health of Fleet tracking log and maintained within the corrosion control section.
   A3.1.3. The results of the paint scores will be used during the weekly scheduling meeting
   and every effort will be made to schedule hangar time for the highest scoring aircraft. In
   order to facilitate the painting of aircraft with minimal down time, touch-ups should be
   accomplished towards the end of the week and allowed to cure over the weekend.
