1. General. Units selected by their MAJCOM will certify aircrews and ground support personnel for
FARP operations using the guidance in this instruction. Portions of AFSOCR 55-12(J)/AMCR 55-5, 1
Jun 93 have been incorporated into this instruction.
    1.1. FARP operation is the overall mission to include the transfer of fuel. Hot refueling is the actual
    transfer of fuel from any aircraft fuel source with one or more engines operating. Hot refueling
    includes fuel transfer from internal aircraft fuel tanks, auxiliary tanks, or internally loaded fuel blad-
    ders, such as the Aerial Bulk Fuel Delivery System (ABFDS) with or without Alternate Capability
    Equipment (ACE). When the ABFDS is equipped with ACE, fuel transfer to another aircraft is possi-
    ble. FARP operations are normally conducted at night in an austere environment. A comprehensive
    mission briefing and strict compliance of guidance and procedures will ensure an expeditious and safe
    refuel or defuel operation. The term FARP applies to all such operations with the following distinc-
    tions made for specific activities:

3. FARP SITE CERTIFICATION. Sites fall into two categories: permanent and temporary. Both sites
require certification prior to FARP operations.
    3.1. Permanent Sites. An on-scene FARP site survey will be accomplished by MAJCOM /wing/
    group. A FARP site certification team will select and certify the proposed site.
AFI11-235 15 DECEMBER 2000                                                                               9

     3.1.1. The permanent site certification team will consists of the following:
         3.1.1.1. A loadmaster (C-130/C-5/C-17) or flight engineer (C-141/C-5) with extensive knowl-
         edge of FARP operations and procedures.
         3.1.1.2. A safety member from the unit or host safety office familiar with refueling safety
         requirements and aircraft taxi operations.
         3.1.1.3. A FARP qualified fuels member knowledgeable of requirements and equipment.
         3.1.1.4. A member from the host airfield management office, familiar with aircraft ramp
         requirements, airfield safety, and clearance criteria.
         3.1.1.5. A representative from the host Environmental Management Office that is familiar
         with local environmental requirements and concerns.
         3.1.1.6. A host fire chief or senior fire representative familiar with aircraft crash, rescue and
         fuel servicing fire protection requirements.
         3.1.1.7. ST FARP Surveyor.
  3.2. Temporary Sites. Temporary sites allow certification and use for specific exercises and bare base
  operations. Temporary sites used more than twice in a one year period become recurring sites and
  require permanent certification according to paragraph 3.1.
     3.2.1. Temporary sites anticipated for recurring use to support unilateral/bilateral/multilateral
     training will be certified IAW permanent site certification procedures. Recurring use of the site
     for subsequent exercises will require recertification prior to each use. Recertification of previously
     certified temporary sites will be accomplished by annotating the date of recertification, exercise
     name, inclusive dates of use, ST surveyor, reviewer and approval authority signature on a memo-
     randum for record (MFR). Attach MFR to the front of AF Form 4066, Forward Area Refueling
     Point (FARP) Site Survey.
     3.2.2. Unit requesting a FARP survey will perform the initial coordination with the airfield man-
     ager before the site survey team departs on the survey. Exercise planners will ensure that proposed
     FARP sites are certified prior to start of exercise.
     3.2.3. Forward site surveys to HQ AFSOC/DOXT or HQ AMC/DOK, (as appropriate) for
     approval of temporary site certifications. HQ AFSOC/DOXT will maintain a copy of the com-
     pleted survey package.
     EXCEPTION: For short notice exercises and contingencies, AVTEG, and 66 AOS may authorize
     the use of temporary FARP sites surveyed IAW this AFI and T.O.00-25-172 by 720 STG or their
     subordinate units.
     3.2.4. The temporary site certification team will consist of the following:
         3.2.4.1. ST FARP surveyor and a loadmaster (C-130/C-5/C-17) or flight engineer (C-141/
         C-5) with extensive knowledge of FARP operations.
         3.2.4.2. The survey team will coordinate with the airfield manager or their designated repre-
         sentative for site survey requirements.
         3.2.4.3. The survey team will coordinate with the host fire chief or senior fire department rep-
         resentative familiar with aircraft crash, rescue and fuel servicing fire protection requirements.

4. Certification Criteria. Consider the following criteria when conducting FARP site certification:
     4.1. Minimum distance between tanker/receiver aircraft and aircraft parking areas, buildings, and
     mass refueling/unit parking area is 200 feet as prescribed in T.O. 00-25-172, table 4-2. (See Attach-
     ment 3.)
     4.2. Distance between refueling aircraft and taxiing aircraft is 50 feet; however, part of any aircraft
     may pass within 50 feet of a FARP operation as long as the operating engines of the taxiing aircraft do
     not penetrate the 50-foot criteria as prescribed in T.O. 00-25-172, table 4-2 (see attachment 3)
     4.3. FARP layout:
        4.3.1. Minimum distance between tanker Single Point Refueling (SPR) and receiver SPR will be
        300 feet, IAW T.O. 00-25-172. (See attachment 3)
        4.3.2. Minimum distance between refueling points is 200 feet (exception: minimum distance
        between refueling points when refueling C-141 and C-130 receiver aircraft will be 400 feet). (See
        attachment 3 and attachment 8)
        4.3.3. Make every effort to position C-130 tanker aircraft 45 degrees off centerline. This should
        reduce prop blast sustained by the Hot Refueling Supervisor (HRS), HDPs and receiver aircraft.
        (See attachment 6)
        4.3.4. Make every effort to position Forward Area Manifold (FAM) cart and refueling points on
        hard surface. Mission scenario and FARP site location will dictate placement of FAM cart and
        refueling points.
        4.3.5. Certify site for the largest type tanker aircraft and the maximum number of refueling points
        the site can support. Consider the length, width and weight bearing capacity of runway and FARP
        site.
        4.3.6. Ensure area will allow spilled fuel to drain away from the aircraft and FARP equipment.
        Spilled fuel will not be allowed to drain into a stream, river, or drainage ditch. Servicing within
        120-feet of drainage ditches/low lying areas and pressurized fuel servicing components should be
        avoided due to explosive fuel vapor accumulation. (See attachment 3)
     4.4. Environmental Impact Analysis:
        4.4.1. Permanent Site Certification.
            4.4.1.1. CONUS Sites. Send AF Form 813 or sister service equivalent, to the installation
            environmental planning function as early in the site selection process as possible.
            4.4.1.2. Overseas Sites. Complete AF Form 813 or host country equivalent. Reference For-
            eign Guidance Standards, Status of Forces Agreement, treaties and/or Overseas Baseline
            Guidance Document in completing the AF Form 813. At a minimum the airfield manager will
            certify using a MOA that all local environmental standards and criteria have been met.
            Include MOA with package.
        4.4.2. Temporary Site Certification. The airfield manager will confirm that all local environmen-
        tal standards and criteria have been met. Exercise sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the
        environmental impact analysis has been completed.
     4.5. Emergency Egress and Reassemble Area. Ensure both tanker and receiver aircraft have a mini-
     mum unobstructed egress distance of 1,000 feet to taxi from the FARP site in the event of an emer-
AFI11-235 15 DECEMBER 2000                                                                                   11

   gency. Rotary wing aircraft may have a flyaway egress route in lieu of taxi distance. If the distance
   is less than 1,000 feet or egress area is obstructed, tanker/receiver aircraft will perform FARP in a cold
   environment only.
   4.6. Type surface (concrete, asphalt, clay, grass, dirt, etc.).
   4.7. Obstacles and hazards within the vicinity of the FARP site.
   4.8. Fire and crash coverage. Ensure vehicle and equipment availability for largest aircraft using the
   site. Ensure fuel spill response capability to include HAZMAT response. A Crash Fire Rescue (CFR)
   vehicle will be on scene prior to commencing FARP operations. The CFR vehicle will be positioned
   in clear view of the FARP operation to monitor visual signals from FARP team members and if possi-
   ble, maintain radio contact with the ST controller, tanker/receiver aircraft, or tower.
       4.8.1. When performing FARP operations, position a fire extinguisher, minimum of one
       20-pound dry chemical or equivalent, in the immediate vicinity of the tanker SPR panel, at each
       receiver point, and at the FAM cart, when used. Use a 150-pound flightline Halon 1211 (or equiv-
       alent agent) in lieu of the 20-pound fire extinguisher, if a fuel truck is used. Position the fire extin-
       guisher between the fuel vehicle and the aircraft refueling panel.
       4.8.2. For exercises and contingencies, if a CFR vehicle cannot be provided, as a minimum posi-
       tion one 20-pound dry chemical fire extinguisher or equivalent at the tanker SPR, each receiver
       point, and the FAM cart, if used.
       4.8.3. When the site specific contingency plan is implemented follow AFI 32-4001, Chapter 4,
       Disaster Preparedness Planning and Operations, and AFI 32-4002, Chapter 5, Hazardous Mate-
       rial Emergency Planning and Response Program.

5. FARP Site Survey Package. The survey package will consist of the following items:
   5.1. FARP site survey approval letter from wing/group to HQ AFSOC/DOX or HQ AMC/DOK (Not
   required for temporary FARP site surveys). (See paragraph 8. and figure a11.1.)

   graphs if available. (See figure a11.2. and figure a11.3.)
   5.4. Tab 3. Support agreement or MOA to address host base support requirements (Not required for
   temporary FARP site surveys). (See figure a11.4.)
   5.5. Tab 4. AF Form 813. Temporary FARP site surveys refer to paragraph 4.4.2.
   5.6. Tab 5. Appropriate Landing Zone Survey. Required for unpublished airfields.

6. Sister Services’ FARP Sites. FARP sites that have been surveyed and certified by a Sister Service do
not require additional certification. Their local procedures will apply as long as they meet area size, emer-
gency egress and reassemble criteria in this instruction. If the existing sister service survey does not meet
paragraph 4. criteria, do not use the site for FARP operations. Forward a copy of the survey and local pro-
cedures to HQ AFSOC/DOXT for review and inclusion in the master survey listing.

NOTE
1. Distance criteria is measured as the closest distance between any part of an aircraft and building or
facility involved. For parking areas, measure from the closest authorized parking positions.
2. Ensure both tanker and receiver aircraft have a minimum unobstructed egress distance of 1,000 feet to
taxi from the FARP site in the event of an emergency. Rotary wing aircraft may have a flyaway egress
route in lieu of taxi distance. If the distance is less than 1,000 feet or egress area is obstructed, tanker/
receiver aircraft will perform FARP in a cold environment only.
*Part of an aircraft may pass within 50 feet of a FARP operation as long as the operating engine(s) of the
taxiing aircraft do not penetrate the 50-foot criteria.
**Distance between tanker SPR and receiver SPR.
