Training policy, guidance, and requirements are set forth for each phase of aircrew training. The
phases are progressively designed to develop the mission readiness of each aircrew member
while maintaining previously acquired proficiency. For the purposes of this instruction the
“National Guard Bureau (NGB)” is considered a Major Command (MAJCOM).
   1.1.1. Qualification Training (Chapter 2) qualifies pilots for basic aircrew duties.
   1.1.2. Mission Qualification Training (Chapter 3) qualifies aircrew members in the unit’s
   mission.
   1.1.3. Continuation Training (Chapter 4) provides the capability for aircrew members to
   reinforce and build upon previous training and conduct mission oriented aircrew training
   designed to enhance and maintain mission readiness.
   1.1.4. Upgrade and Specialized Training (Chapter 5) upgrades pilots to aircraft commander,
   air refueling aircraft commander, air refueling instructor, and upgrades all aircrew members
   to instructor and flight examiner.
1.2. Key Words Explained.
   1.2.1. "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.2.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
   accomplishment.
   1.2.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.2.4. "NOTE" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered
   essential to emphasize.
1.3. Training Objective. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop
and maintain a high state of mission readiness to facilitate immediate and effective employment
in exercises, contingencies, limited war, and general war operations.
1.4. Responsibilities.
   1.4.1. Headquarters Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), in coordination with
   Headquarters United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the NGB, will
   establish and supervise an aircrew training program consistent with the policies and
   requirements of this instruction.
   1.4.2. Commanders at each level will comply with the policies and intent of this instruction
   and ensure that safety is not compromised, and monitor aircrew training to ensure these
   programs are both aggressively and realistically designed and executed. Aircrew personnel
   engaged in qualification or upgrade training will complete their training in a timely and
   uninterrupted manner. Aircrew members entered in any training program leading to
 6                                                       AFI11-2C-32BV1 28 FEBRUARY 2011


     qualification should be dedicated to that program on a full-time basis. Consideration should
     be given to relieving them of all other duties not directly related to the training.
     1.4.3. Unit CC/Director of Operations (DO) or Training Office will identify areas where
     additional training is needed and direct unit training accordingly. They will initiate action to
     obtain necessary training support from the appropriate office or headquarters as soon as the
     need for assistance becomes apparent. Unit CC/DO or Training Office will ensure mission
     objectives are prebriefed, debriefed, and evaluated to ensure successful mission
     accomplishment. They will also initiate waiver requests of training requirements through
     appropriate channels when facilities and support are not available.
1.5. Aircrew Training Policy:
     1.5.1. The primary training method for C-32B initial qualification, requalification or upgrade
     training is in unit training using MAJCOM approved SOI. Training personnel will prepare
     an AF Form 4109, SOF/CSAR Aircrew Training Record, prior to beginning unit-developed
     training.
     1.5.2. Training Records. Use AF Form 4109 to document the qualification, re-qualification,
     specialized training, or upgrade of an aircrew member. This record and attached forms will
     provide a chronological record of qualification or upgrade training administered by the unit
     of assignment and serves as a syllabus. It documents all applicable ground training, special
     function training and flying training accomplished by an aircrew member. Instructions for
     completing and managing training records are contained in attachment 2.
     1.5.3. Training time limitations. C-32B crew members should start initial upgrade or re-
     qualification training within 60 days after reporting for duty unless formal school dates are
     unavailable. The unit will notify NGB/A3T (cc to AFSOC/A3VS) before a crew member
     will exceed this limit.
        1.5.3.1. C-32B crew members must complete in-unit qualification or re-qualification
        within 120 days from the date of their first ground training session or flight (whichever
        occurs first). Individuals unable to complete the training within this specified time limit
        may continue training, however, the unit must request an extension from NGB/A3T (cc
        to AFSOC/A3VS) with a description of the difficulty and an expected completion date.
     1.5.4. The number of training tasks in the initial qualification, mission qualification, or
     upgrade training guide is a recommended average which normally allows the student to
     achieve the desired level of proficiency. It is not intended to restrict the number of times a
     task may be accomplished. However, if in the judgment of the unit CC/DO, excessive flights
     are required, refer to paragraph 1.16
     1.5.5. Early advancement is acceptable with a recommendation from the trainee's instructor
     and concurrence of the unit CC/DO for all upgrades. The recommendation and concurrence
     must be documented in the individual's training record prior to the flight evaluation.
     1.5.6. Individual events accomplished during satisfactory completion of initial, mission, and
     upgrade evaluations may be credited towards the individual's currency requirements.
     Individual events accomplished during satisfactory completion of an instructor certified
     upgrade may be credited towards the individual’s currency requirements provided the
     appropriate AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications, entry has been accomplished.
AFI11-2C-32BV1 28 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                      7


   1.5.7. Except where specifically covered by this instruction, an instructor pilot will be at a
   set of flight controls during:
       1.5.7.1. All basic pilot qualification training.
       1.5.7.2. Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) qualification training from the pre-contact position
       or closer.
       1.5.7.3. Touch and go landings, when the other pilots are not touch and go certified.
       1.5.7.4. AAR contacts from the right seat when the other pilot is not right seat certified.
       1.5.7.5. Simulated engine-out training.
       1.5.7.6. Other times required by applicable operational instructions or at the discretion of
       the instructor pilot. EXCEPTIONS: 1. IP candidates, under the supervision of a
       qualified IP (not in a pilot's seat), may occupy a pilot seat with an unqualified pilot except
       during takeoff, landing, simulated engine-out training, and air refueling from the pre-
       contact position to contact. 2. During initial and re-qualification IP evaluations, IP
       candidates may exercise all of the privileges of a fully qualified IP, under the supervision
       of a flight examiner (whether or not the examiner is in a pilot’s seat).
1.6. Waivers. HQ USAF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for training requirements specified in
AFI 11-202, Vol. 1. Waiver authority is delegated to MAJCOM/A3 for specific aircrew training
events (case by case basis). These requirements currently include initial CRM training, initial
life support equipment and procedures training, SERE, flight evaluations, and egress training
(see AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, for specific guidance). Some ground training items (e.g. small arms
training, LOAC, etc) are tasked by other agencies. Reference the source instruction to determine
the waiver authority in these cases. HQ AFSOC/A3 or NGB/A3O is the waiver authority for
MDS-specific Volume 1 aircrew training requirements unless otherwise noted in this AFI.
   1.6.1. Waivers to the requirements of this instruction will be submitted via message, memo,
   fax, or email through the group training office to the OG/CC, or NGB/A3T or AFSOC/A3VS
   (as applicable) for approval, unless otherwise specified. Group commanders are the
   delegated waiver authority for flying hour requirements and for ground and flying training
   requirements as outlined below in paragraph 1.6.4. 150 SOS/DOT will keep an accurate
   record of all waivers granted and notify NGB/A3T or AFSOC/A3VS, as appropriate, by

        of this AFI for assigned or attached crew members (case-by-case basis only). Base the
        decision to approve a waiver on the individual crew member's experience and proficiency
        level. NOTE: Ground training waivers will not be based on a crew member's
        availability. The OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the waiver (e.g., 30-
        day extension, next training cycle, etc.). OG/CC should consider if sufficient flying
        events were accomplished (to ensure MR proficiency), before waiver approval. Do not
        approve a waiver request for the same flying or ground training event deficiency
        affecting two consecutive training periods. Notify NGB/A3T (cc to AFSOC/A3VS)
        when waivers or extensions are issued.
        1.6.4.3. If necessary, submit a written request through the OG/CC (or equivalent) to the

AFI11-2C-32BV1 28 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                   9


   1.7.2. Airborne Mission Systems Specialist(s) (AMSS) and Loadmaster (LM) may train two
   students at the same time, provided the crew complement only requires one of their
   respective crew positions.
1.8. Senior Officer Flying/Supervisory Aircrew:
   1.8.1. Senior Officer Flying. Senior officers in authorized flying positions (Aircrew Position
   Indicator (API) 6 or 8) may be qualified in the unit aircraft if they have completed a formal
   upgrade course (orientation courses do not apply). They must complete annual written
   exams and flight evaluations that will be annotated on an AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
   Qualification.
       1.8.1.1. Colonels will maintain either basic qualification, mission capable, or mission
       ready status, and complete the appropriate ground and flying training requirements
       outlined in Chapters 2, 3, and 4.
       1.8.1.2. Lieutenant Colonel and below will maintain either basic qualification, mission
       capable, or mission ready status, and complete the appropriate ground and flying training
       requirements outlined in Chapters 2, 3, and 4. Flying unit commanders and operations
       officers will maintain mission ready or mission capable status.
   1.8.2. Supervisory Flying. Senior officers in authorized supervisory flying positions per AFI
   11-401 may fly in primary crew positions in the C-32B in observer status only, and only after
   completion of the Senior Officer Orientation Course. They must have current flight
   physicals, physiological training, and egress training prior to their first flight. They will log
   “O” or “X” time (not creditable for pay) and will not occupy a pilot’s seat with passengers on
   board. Senior officer pilots logging “O” or “X” time will always fly with an instructor pilot
   when occupying a pilot seat.
   1.8.3. Senior Officer Multiple Aircraft Qualification. Senior officers in supervisory flying
   positions (API 6 or 8) maintaining multiple aircraft qualification must have completed a
   formal upgrade course. Basic qualification requires periodic qualification examinations and
   flight evaluations for each aircraft. AAR/Mission qualification requires an initial
   AAR/Mission flight evaluation in the C-32B. There are no recurring requirements for
   AAR/Mission qualification.
1.9. Unit Indoctrination Training. Prior to performing unsupervised aircrew duties, crew
member will complete a unit indoctrination program. This training is a requirement for all newly
assigned aircrew members. The unit will publish a directive outlining specific ground and flight
requirements. Design this training to prepare aircrew members for the unit’s operational
mission. The training will; familiarize them with the local flying area and facilities/support
agencies available and introduce any unique mission procedures. Document unit indoctrination
training in Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) for assigned and attached
personnel.
1.10. Initial Cadre for Change of Aircraft, Equipment, or Capability. When possible,
qualified personnel in other units operating like equipment will provide the initial cadre. In some
instances, it will be necessary for units converting from one design aircraft to another to form an
initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification requirements may be
waived. Authorization to form initial cadre crews will be contained in the conversion program
 10                                                    AFI11-2C-32BV1 28 FEBRUARY 2011


action directive. Unless otherwise stated in the program action directive, the following
conditions will apply to management of initial cadre aircrew qualification:
   1.10.1. A nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) will be formed to
   begin aircrew conversion. Converting units send proposed initial cadre list by name, rank,
   current crew position and aircraft, total flying time, and requested crew qualification level
   through channels to NGB/A3 (CC to AFSOC/A3) for approval.
   1.10.2. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held; for
   example, mission pilot to flight examiner. On subsequent evaluations enter appropriate
   comments in the remarks section of AF Form 8, explaining the individual's status as initial
   cadre instructor.
   1.10.3. Following final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre instructors and
   flight examiners by aircraft and crew qualification and file in each cadre individual's Flight
   Evaluation Folder. Make an AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation, entry documenting the
   initial cadre letter.
1.11. Unit Aircrew Capability. The unit will maintain mission ready status on all primary
aircrew members up to unit authorizations. Commanders will ensure aircrews are trained to
meet capabilities specified in the unit Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement. Unit
planners, supervisory aircrew and staff members assigned or attached which are in excess of the
units mission requirements will maintain mission ready, mission capable, or basic qualification
status, as directed by the unit commander.
1.12. Use of the Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS). The unit will develop
local procedures to ensure aircrew ground and flying training is properly documented and
updated in ARMS. Each unit will provide a printed copy of current ground and flying training
summaries to each individual prior to joining another flying unit.
1.13. Changes. Recommendations for improvement to this instruction are encouraged. Send to
AFSOC/A3V on AF Form 847.
1.14. Deviations. This instruction does not authorize deviations from the flight manual or any
other Air Force Instruction. Flight safety will be given prime consideration and must take
precedence over the requirements and guidance of this instruction.
1.15. Publication Administration. All aircrew members are authorized this publication. This
publication is available on the e-publishing website. As a minimum, 150 Stan/Eval Office, 150
Training Office, NGB/A3T and AFSOC/A3VS will maintain copies of this instruction.
1.16. Failure to Progress. If a student fails to progress according to syllabus requirements, the
unit will conduct a Progress Review Board (PRB). The PRB can recommend continuation in
training; or an AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges,
action; (e.g., a Flying Evaluation Board (FEB) to the unit commander). The PRB, at a minimum,
will be comprised of the unit DO, Stan/Eval Office, Training Office and a senior enlisted
advisor. The contract civilian training facility will identify students who fail to progress IAW
the formal training syllabus (pilots only).
1.17. Career Enlisted Aviators (CEA). CEA are not tied to AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military
Personnel (Officer and Enlisted),for aircrew qualification upgrade. All enlisted aircrew
qualifications are separate and distinct from skill level qualification. When an AF Form 8 is
AFI11-2C-32BV1 28 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                    11


completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then that crew member is qualified to perform all
duties assigned to that crew qualification regardless of skill level. Aircrew instructor and flight
examiner qualifications are also separate and distinct from OJT trainer or certifier designation
and are reflected in the Air Force Specialty Code by use of “K” prefix (aircrew instructor) and
“Q” prefix (aircrew flight examiner).
1.18. C-32B Pilot Designation (PD) Codes. AFI 11-401, defines pilot aviation codes. For
standardization and upgrade flow, use the codes in Table 1.2 (3rd letter designator distinguishes
the status for a pilot who has/has not completed mission qualification/certification training
events, or is restricted to an air-land only status (no AAR):

NOTES:

1. Unless a previously C-32 qualified aircraft commander, all pilots will begin in a crew
qualification no higher than MC (P). The unit commander should take into consideration total
flight time and previous aircraft flown to determine their initial qualification level. OG/CC (or
equivalent) is waiver authority for initial qualification level.

2. Aircraft commanders and co-pilots that have not completed Mission/AAR qualification may be
certified as a MP (R) or MC (R) and act as the pilot in command or co-pilot on all missions where
no AAR is scheduled.

3. Instructors restricted to air-land only instructor duties “IP (R)” are not restricted from
performing AAR operation as a mission pilot (MP), if they are AAR qualified. The air-land
only restriction applies only to the performance of instructor duties.

beginning in-unit qualification training.
2.3. Time Period for Qualification. In addition to the requirements in paragraph 1.5.3, pilots
should start unit qualification training within 30 days of the completion of contract simulator
training. The unit will notify NGB/A3T (cc to AFSOC/A3VS) before a crew member will
exceed this limit.

Section 2B—Prerequisites.

2.4. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the MAJCOM approved SOI, AFI
11-202 V1, and this instruction. The only prerequisites that must be met prior to starting the
formal simulator course are those required by the simulator training provider.

Section 2C—Ground Training Requirements.

2.5. Ground Training Requirements.
   2.5.1. Academic Training. Ground training requirements are listed in MAJCOM approved
   SOI.
   2.5.2. Ground Training. Prior to the first flight, all items in Table 4.1 that have Note 1
   attached, must be completed.
   2.5.3. Written Examinations. Written examinations must be completed before the end of
   qualification flying training. Prepare the written examinations locally and take questions
   from the appropriate series aircraft manuals or technical orders. Passing grade is 85 percent.
   When completed by the student, the exam will be graded and corrected to 100 percent. All
   pilots must also satisfactorily complete the annual instrument refresher course and exam if
   not presently holding valid completion dates.

Section 2E—Aircraft Conversion Training.

2.7. Basic          Aircraft         Qualification          Conversion/Difference      Training
Requirements. Conversion training is normally associated with training between different
Mission Design Series (MDS). Difference training is normally conducted when training in a
different series aircraft in the same MDS. Conversion training results in an aircraft evaluation
and difference training is usually completed with an instructor sign-off. Use difference training
when changing between same design aircraft and the amount of training needed for qualification
does not warrant attendance at a formal qualification course. Additionally, accomplish
difference training when an aircraft is modified and required training for that modification can
easily be accomplished in-unit. Conversion training requires the completion of the appropriate
AF Form 411, SOF/CSAR Training Record, and satisfactory completion of the applicable MDS
written qualification examination. After conversion training, crew members will maintain
qualification as outlined in this chapter, at the discretion of the unit commander.

   status must accomplish all of the basic aircraft training requirements of Table 4.3
 18                                                    AFI11-2C-32BV1 28 FEBRUARY 2011


       4.3.2.1. Mission ready aircrew members will accomplish all of the applicable mission
       ready requirements from Table 4.3
       4.3.2.2. Mission capable aircrew members will accomplish at least 50 percent of the
       applicable basic/mission ready requirements from Table 4.3 In addition, an overseas
       sortie is not required for mission capable aircrew members. NOTE: If a mission
       capable aircrew member flies as a primary crew member on an overseas sortie, they
       should be under the direct supervision of an instructor. Unit CC/DO is the approval
       authority for operations without an instructor.
   4.3.3. Prorating Training Requirements.         Prorate aircrew member flying training
   requirements for individuals not available for flying duties due to non-flying Temporary
   Duty (TDY), Duties Not Including Flying (DNIF), emergency leave, etc. and aircraft non-
   availability. Prorate individual requirements based on the number of full calendar months
   left in the training period following completion of basic qualification, mission qualification
   and re-qualification. Use Table 4.2 to determine the number of sorties and events required
   for an individual after proration.
4.4. Recurrency/Requalification Training. This is training that an aircrew member must
accomplish under the supervision of an instructor when currency/qualification has been lost. The
event resulting in recurrency and each event thereafter are creditable for the currency training
period. Conduct requalification training under the supervision of an instructor or flight examiner
when an aircrew member is non-current in excess of six months (unqualified).
   4.4.1. Basic Currency/Requalification. Failure to accomplish basic currency or volume
   items from Table 4.3 which are required every calendar month, 60 days, 90 days, or semi-
   annual period, results in the loss of basic currency. Basic recurrency/requalification training
   requirements are shown in Table 4.4 Individual proficiency will dictate the number of
   events to be flown with an instructor or flight examiner to satisfy sortie delinquency (as a
   minimum, one sortie will be flown).
   4.4.2. Mission Currency. Failure to accomplish all mission currency events that are required
   every semiannual period result in loss of mission currency. Table 4.3 denotes which events
   result in loss of currency in an event, sub-area, or mission; however, non-currency in excess
   of six months results in loss of qualification. Loss of mission currency does not affect basic
   currency. Mission recurrency/requalification training requirements are shown in Table 4.5
   For any mission qualifications that only require an initial certification by an instructor,
   currency/qualification may be regained by showing proficiency in that event to an instructor.
   Crew members that are non-current for an overseas sortie may regain currency under the
   supervision of a current aircrew member in their same crew position.

Section 4D—Ground Training Requirement.

4.5. General Information. Table 4.1 designates ground-training requirements for all aircrew
members. Table notes specify which items are considered either grounding or required for
mission ready status. For grounding items, crew members will not perform flight duties until the
grounding item is satisfied. For mission ready or supervisory items, crew members will fly on
training missions only until these items are satisfied.

   establish the baseline for recurring training. Accomplish this training IAW AFI 16-1301.

Section 4E—Flying Training Requirements.

4.8. Instructor/Evaluator Training Requirements. Instructors and flight examiners will
comply with the semi-annual flying requirements in Table 4.3 Fifty percent of semiannual
flying training requirements may be credited while performing instructor or examiner duties
except where noted. Instructor pilots may credit events accomplished in either seat. Currency
may not be reset for an event in which an instructor/evaluator instructed/evaluated a
student/examinee performing the event. Example: An instructor may credit a non-precision
approach flown by a student under their supervision toward his semi-annual non-precision
approaches; however, that instructor pilot may not credit this approach toward a local proficiency
sortie.
4.9. Logging of Events Completed in the Simulator. Pilots may log up to 25 percent of their
semi-annual flying training requirements (Table 4.3) in the simulator. The events logged will
count only for volume; they may not be used to reset currency requirements. EXCEPTION:
100 percent of Category II ILS approach requirements may be logged in the simulator. NOTE:
Pilots may not log landings performed in the simulator unless the simulator is certified as FAA
level "C" or higher.
4.10. Basic Qualification Event Definitions. The following event definitions apply to Table
4.3. Semiannual Basic Qualification Flying Training Requirements:
 24                                                    AFI11-2C-32BV1 28 FEBRUARY 2011


   4.10.1. Aircrew Proficiency Sortie (APS) [B010]. An aircrew proficiency sortie may be
   logged for an individual who is flying in a primary crew position and meets the following
   position specific criteria:
       4.10.1.1. Pilots may credit an aircrew proficiency sortie if they perform both a takeoff
       and landing from either pilot seat. Credit multiple sorties on multi-leg missions with full-
       stop landings.
       4.10.1.2. Other aircrew members may credit an APS when they complete all pre-flight,
       in-flight, and post-flight duties in their primary crew position. The amount of aircrew
       proficiency sorties credited may not exceed the number required in the crew complement
       listed in AFI 11-2C-32BV3.
       4.10.1.3. An individual may not credit more than one sortie on a local training flight.
   4.10.2. Pilot Local Proficiency Sortie (LPS) [B020]. A local training mission including
   approximately one hour of primary or instructor time practicing instrument, transition, and
   emergency procedures. Fly maneuvers under the supervision of an instructor pilot and repeat
   them until an acceptable level of proficiency is attained or the LPS may not be credited. If
   the LPS is incomplete, the instructor will recommend whether the entire LPS or just the
   incomplete events must be re-accomplished. Instructors and evaluators need not complete all
   LPS events on a single sortie. Credit an LPS when all events are complete. Unit
   commanders may add to the following minimum LPS sortie criteria:
       4.10.2.1. A review of boldface emergency procedures.
       4.10.2.2. Three instrument approaches or two instrument approaches and a holding
       pattern or procedure turn.
       4.10.2.3. A circling approach (traffic permitting).
       4.10.2.4. A simulated engine-out landing (not required for copilots).
       4.10.2.5. A simulated engine-out go-around (not required for copilots).
       4.10.2.6. A Visual Flight Rules traffic pattern (weather permitting).
4.11. Mission Qualification Event Definitions. The following event definitions apply to Table
4.3. Semiannual Basic Qualification Flying Training Requirements:
   4.11.1. Mission Sortie [MS01]. AMSS and LM may credit a mission sortie if they
   accomplish pre-mission planning (if applicable) and complete all appropriate pre-flight, in-
   flight and post-flight requirements. Crew members may dual log a mission sortie and a
   basic sortie if all requirements are completed.
       4.11.1.1. Loadmasters. As a minimum, a mission sortie will include passengers and/or
       an actual up and download of cargo.
       4.11.1.2. AMSS. As a minimum, a mission sortie will include coordination of
       flight/ground activities away from home station and/or an air-to-air refueling sortie.
   4.11.2. Overseas Sortie [OS01]. Pilots may credit an overseas sortie if they occupy either
   pilot seat during an Outside of the Continental United States (OCONUS) takeoff or landing.
   Takeoff or landing must take place from an airport outside United States jurisdiction (a
   mission that flies directly from the Continental United States to Alaska would not qualify as
AFI11-2C-32BV1 28 FEBRUARY 2011                                                              25


   an overseas sortie.) All other aircrew members may credit an overseas sortie if they perform
   primary aircrew duties during an OCONUS mission.
   4.11.3. Air-to-Air Refueling [AR22]. AAR qualified pilots may credit an air-to-air refueling
   sortie if they accomplish a closure from pre-contact and at least 10 minutes of contact time
   with no more than two inadvertent disconnects after initial contact. AAR certified copilots
   may credit an air-to-air refueling sortie if they complete normal copilot AAR duties and
   practice holding the aircraft in a stabilized pre-contact position.
