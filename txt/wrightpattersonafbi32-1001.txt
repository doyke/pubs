1. Overview:
   1.1. General: WPAFB has 11.8 square miles of land with multiple fence lines. The base
   and fence lines in the past have often been used by tenants to display morale/informational
   signs with limited standardized coordination or concern given to the overall aesthetics. This
 4                               WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-1001 16 SEPTEMBER 2013


     lack of control or standard practice has led to a cluttered appearance, which also creates
     distractions and confusion at Base entry control points, creating a safety hazard.
     1.2. Purpose: To mitigate the risk of distractions at entry control points and eliminate clutter
     throughout the base. Also, to initiate a Sign Control Group (SCG) to review/approve all signs
     on WPAFB.
2. Roles and Responsibilities:
     2.1. 88 ABW/CE Director will:
        2.1.1. Establish a SCG to review/validate all informational, morale, and directional sign
        requests for the base.
        2.1.2. Report approvals/disapprovals to the Facility Board and 88 ABW/CC.
        2.1.3. Determine a proper location to display morale/informational signs in both Area A
        and Area B.
     2.2. All Installation Agencies and their personnel will:
        2.2.1. Discontinue displaying any signs anywhere throughout the base without approval
        of the SCG. Any unapproved signs will be removed immediately by CE.
        2.2.2. Use form at Attachment 2 to request signs be posted throughout the base.
3. Process:
     3.1. Customer submits completed request form (WPAFB 1427) located at Attachment 2 to
     the SCG (88ABW.CEWorkflow@us.af.mil). The 88 ABW/CE Exec serves as the
     facilitator of this form and leads it through the approval/disapproval process.
     3.2. SCG board members (CE, SFS, SE) receive form from the CE Exec, via e-mail.
     3.3. The SCG Chair will approve/disapprove the sign request upon recommendation by the
     other two board members.
     3.4. The board members will digitally sign the request and return it to the CE Exec.
     3.5. If approved, the customer will then proceed with the normal work order request process
     to have a sign installed/displayed. Requesting agency will be responsible for maintenance of
     temporary signs and CE will maintain permanent signs installed on WP.
4. Signs: Permanent and Temporary Exterior Identification Signs: Permanent signs consist
of: exterior identification, directional, motivational/morale, informational/base, and traffic signs.
     4.1. Sign Color Standards: The colors used on the signs in this program conform to the
     color standards developed by the Federal Highway Administration. These are the only colors
     that are permitted in the production of Air Force signs, with the exception of motivation
     signs. Semi-gloss paint must fall within the glossimeter readings for eggshell in matte
     finishes (11 to 19 degree gloss on 60 degree glossimeter). These color standards also apply to
     safety signs.

     4.1.11. Pantone Cool Gray #9 (for use on water tower).
  4.2. Freestanding Exterior Signs:
     4.2.1. General Information. Good judgment is very important in determining sign
     placement. Signs should be placed far enough from the edge of the roadway to minimize
     traffic hazards but close enough to be clearly visible to the user.
     4.2.2. Placement. All traffic control signs, including the Type C6 Bus Route Sign, Type
     D, Destination Signs and Type E Parking Regulation Signs, must conform to the
     placement standards shown in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
     Placement of all other signs covered in this pamphlet should conform to the standards in
     this section, which meet or exceed the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
     guidelines. Whenever practical, a minimum lateral clearance of (12’) from the roadway is
     recommended for these signs. All signs less than (12’) from the edge of the roadway
     should have breakaway or yielding sign supports that comply with state standards and/or
     are approved by the Federal Highway Administration.
     4.2.3. Visibility. Signs should be placed where they can be clearly seen by the user.
     Check sight lines before signs are erected to ensure that traffic control devices, roadway
     entrances, and exits are not hidden. Ensure the signs do not block sight distance for
     drivers at intersections. Place signs to take advantage of indirect light from existing light
     sources for good night visibility.
 6                            WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-1001 16 SEPTEMBER 2013


      4.2.4. Relationships to Site. Signs should relate well to their sites, that is, they should
      look good in relation to the nearby landscape and structures.
      4.2.5. Series of Signs. Series of signs requiring driver or pedestrian decisions should be
      placed far enough apart to allow enough time for the user to make the required decisions.
      4.2.6. Visual Clutter. Take care to avoid visual clutter. No sign should be erected unless
      the information it provides is absolutely necessary for directions, identification or
      customer service.
      4.2.7. Lateral Clearance - Rural Signs. In rural or outlying areas, a minimum lateral
      clearance of 4.0 m (12’) from the edge of the traveled way (Figure 4.1) or 1.8 m (6’)
      from the edge of the paved shoulder or curb (Figure 4.1) is preferred, wherever possible,
      for all Identification, Warning, Motivation and Information Signs.
      4.2.8. Lateral Clearance - Urban Signs. In urban areas, signs should be placed with
      minimum lateral clearances of 1.8 m (6’) from the edge of the roadway or paved shoulder
      and 0.6 m (2’) from the face of any curb (Figure 4.2.). A clearance of 0.3 m (1’) from the
      face of the curb is permissible in urban areas where sidewalk width is limited or where
      existing poles are close to the curbs (Figure 4.2).

   4.5. Community Identification Signs: General Description. While the general character of
   these signs is the same as the military identification signs, the background color is different,
   they do not carry military emblems and they seldom carry building numbers. The use of
   commercial and community-related symbols and logotypes is encouraged to add color and
   visual interest.
 10                           WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-1001 16 SEPTEMBER 2013


      4.5.1. Description and Usage. The use of symbols and logotypes on signs identifying
      community facilities assists in identification and adds visual interest. (These symbols
      should appear in the upper left corner of the sign as shown in Figure 4.7. and in Figure
      4.8.) If the base commander approves the community symbol for use on base, it should be
      used on the majority of community signs in order to strengthen the association between
      the symbol and the activities and facilities that it identifies. The symbol will have little
      meaning if it is used on only one or two signs.
      4.5.2. Placement & Colors. They should be placed within a circle as illustrated in Figure
      4.7. and should always be black or dark colored on a white or light colored background.
      The light colored background should have a Munsell value notation of 5.0 to 10.0. Note
      that the community symbol appears directly on the sign face. It is the only symbol that is
      not placed within a square.
      4.5.3. AAFES Facilities. Facilities run by AAFES will display the registered trademark

      4.5.11. Bus Route Sign Type C6 (Figure 4.23.). Introduction. Most Air Force bases have
      buses operating on prescribed routes to move people to destinations on and off base.
      These routes are sometimes an extension of local public transportation, and sometimes
      special services. Clear and consistent identification of bus routes, stops, and schedules
      will make transportation more convenient. Note: Sign Type C6 does not have to comply
      with the ADAAG.
          4.5.11.1. Usage. Use the Type C6 Bus Route Sign to identify bus stops and bus
          routes. Graphics may appear on one or both sides of the sign, depending on sign
          placement. (See paragraph 4.2 for placement standards.) The basic sign panel
          consists of the standard bus symbol or a local transit company logo and the words
          “Bus Stop.” See panels in Figure 4.24.
          4.5.11.2. Mounting. An additional sign panel may be placed below the basic sign
          panel to provide further information. Mount both panels on the same type of backing
          sheet during fabrication. The backing sheet should have rounded corners. See panels
          C and D in Figure 4.24. and the sign layouts.

   4.6. Direction Signs.
      4.6.1. Message Limitations. Area designations such as East Base or West Base should be
      used only if they are meaningful. No more than four destinations should appear on one
      direction sign. If it is necessary to show more than four destinations, add a second sign,
      but do not use more than two direction signs in any situation. See paragraph 4.2 for sign
      placement standards.
28                           WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-1001 16 SEPTEMBER 2013


     4.6.2. Visibility. Fabricate all graphics from white reflective materials to facilitate
     nighttime visibility. Green reflective sheeting is preferred to paint for the sign
     background.
     4.6.3. Criteria. All traffic control signs on base streets should comply with the Manual on
     Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), as the streets are considered public roads.
     4.6.4. Placement. As the layouts indicate, messages are placed flush left or flush right in
     relation to the arrow. Arrows pointing left or up will have flush left messages, and arrows
     pointing to the right will have flush right messages. The arrow is centered in the space
     between the message and the edge of the sign.
     4.6.5. Rules. The letters are always Helvetica medium. The message area accommodates
     a maximum of 17 tiles or characters. Spell names out in full whenever possible. If
     abbreviations are required, conform to AFDD1-2, Air Force Glossary.
     4.6.6. Direction Sign Type D1 (Figure 4.25.).
        4.6.6.1. Information and Sizes. No more than four destination messages are permitted
        on a sign. The sign panel is normally 2 700 mm (9”- 0”) wide, but if the messages are
        short, the width of the sign may be reduced by 150 mm (6”) increments, as
        appropriate. A typical sign with shorter messages is shown in Figure 4.26. In this
        case the width of the sign has been reduced to 2 400 mm (8’- 0”).
        4.6.6.2. Visibility. Use a white border on the sign panel and rules between the
        destinations to increase night time visibility.
        4.6.6.3. Graphics. Graphics should appear on only one side of the sign since the sign
        will be placed in advance of an intersection and will be viewed by traffic moving in
        one direction only.
        4.6.6.4. Colors. White letters, arrows, rules and borders (reflectivity mandatory) on
        standard green background (reflectivity desirable). Most Air Force installations
        currently use standard brown as the background color. To maintain visual
        consistency, individual sign replacements or additions should continue with the
        established base standard. Since green is the background color that the MUTCD has
        established for this sign type, every effort should be made to comply if a basewide
        direction sign replacement project is undertaken.
        4.6.6.5. Dimensions. 450 mm x 2 700 mm (1’- 6" x 9’- 0") to 1 800 mm x 2 700 mm
        (6’- 0" x 9’- 0"). If the sign is placed where parking and/or pedestrian movement is
        likely to occur, or if there are other obstructions to view, a clear height of 2 100 mm
        (7’- 0”) to the bottom of the sign panel should be maintained. Maintain a clear height
        of 1 500 mm (5’ 0") if no such hazards exist.

            4.6.6.6.1. Upper and lower case Helvetica medium, 150 mm (6") capital letter

            length of 17 tiles or characters per line.

Figure 4.26. Direction Sign Type D1 Layout 1




      4.6.7. Direction Sign Type D2 (Figure 4.27.).
          4.6.7.1. Usage. The Type D2 sign is used on roadways with a posted speed limit of
          40 km/hr (25 miles per hour) or less.
          4.6.7.2. Information. Use separate slat for each destination so that messages can be
          changed without remaking the entire sign face. No more than four destinations are
          permitted on a sign. If the sign shows four destinations and those destinations are not
          likely to change, the sign may be fabricated as a single panel. Separate each
          destination with a white rule.
          4.6.7.3. Placement. If the sign is placed where parking and/or pedestrian movement
          is likely to occur, or if there are other obstructions to view, a clear height of 2 100
          mm (7’- 0”) to the bottom of the sign panel should be maintained. Maintain a clear
          height of 1 500 mm (5’- 0”) if no such hazards exist.
          4.6.7.4. Visibility. Use white border on the sign panel to increase nighttime visibility.
          4.6.7.5. Graphics. Graphics appear on only one side since the sign is placed in
          advance of an intersection and will be viewed by traffic moving in one direction only.
          4.6.7.6. Layout. See Figure 4.28. for sign layout.
          4.6.7.7. Colors. White letters, arrows, rules and borders (reflectivity mandatory) on
          standard green background (reflectivity desirable). To maintain visual consistency,
          individual sign replacements or additions should continue with the established base
          standard. Since green is the background color that the MUTCD has established for
          this sign type, every effort should be made to comply if a base-wide direction sign
          replacement project is undertaken.
          4.6.7.8. Dimensions. Slats - 300 mm x 1 800 mm (1’- 0” x 6’- 0”).

          4.6.9.1. Building Accessibility. When not all entrances to a building are accessible,
          inaccessible entrances shall have directional signage to indicate the route to the
          nearest accessible entrance. Directional signage may take the form of directional
          arrows or in the case of complex instructions, written directional information.
          4.6.9.2. Depending on site conditions the sign may either be wall or post mounted.

          information sign 150 mm x 150 mm (6” x 6”).
   4.7. Regulatory Signs: Highway Standards (Figure 4.31., Figure 4.32.).
      4.7.1. Introduction. Highway Standards regulate vehicular traffic on base. Refer to the
      Manual onUniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) published by the Federal
      Highway Administration for highway standards in the United States. Similar standards
      exist for foreign countries.
      4.7.2. Importance of Standards. Any deviation from the accepted highway safety signs
      could create serious safety hazards. It is important to continue the use of familiar
      highway signs on base, so highway warnings and other regulatory signs and traffic
      control devices should follow the standard shapes, designs, and colors of the nation
      where the base is located.
      4.7.3. References. In the United States, these standards are described in the Manual on
      Uniform Traffic Control Devices and must be followed for all traffic control signs. The
      parking regulation signs discussed in paragraph 4.9 utilize standard symbols and are
      intended to supplement the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

   4.8. Base Warning Signs.
      4.8.1. Introduction. Several types of signs are used to define areas of restricted access in
      order to maintain proper levels of security. Warning signs are displayed at the installation
      perimeter, at controlled areas or facilities, restricted areas or facilities and facilities
      protected by Intrusion Detection Equipment (IDE).
36                           WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-1001 16 SEPTEMBER 2013


     4.8.2. Requirements and Guidance. The requirements and guidance for the proper use of
     warning signs are contained in AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program.
     4.8.3. Mounting. Warning signs may be mounted directly on fences or walls. Locations
     and frequency are to be in accordance with AFI 31-101. The structural support for free-
     standing warning signs will be in compliance with established base standards. Warning
     signs are not to be mounted to the face, or supporting structure, of any other sign type.
     4.8.4. Layouts. See Figures 4.33 through 4.38 for the sign layouts.
     4.8.5. Base Warning Sign Type E1 (Figure 4.33).
        4.8.5.1. Usage. Use the Type E1 Base Warning Sign Layout for the Air Force
        Installation Warning Sign, the Controlled Area Sign, and the Restricted Area Sign at
        all personnel and vehicle entry points. If working dog teams are used inside or around
        a posted area, place the military working dog team notice directly below the sign
        panel.
        4.8.5.2. Mounting. Combinations of additional notices, such as a solicitation warning
        or photography prohibition, may be required at base entry points. Place these notices
        directly below the installation warning sign or combine them on a separate sign
        structure placed below Warning Sign Panel E. Mount all the panels on the same
        backing sheet during fabrication. If two sign structures are required, the height of the
        two structures should be equal (not to exceed 7’- 0” or 2 100 mm) and the signs
        should be distributed evenly between them.
        4.8.5.3. Visibility. Both the background panel and the message on all base warning
        signs must be reflective.

   4.9. Parking Regulation Signs (Figure 4.39.).
      4.9.1. Introduction. Parking Regulation Signs, Type E1 and E2, identify general and
      restricted parking areas. They are designed to meet the specific needs of the Air Force
      and to supplement the national standards noted in paragraph 4.7.1. The large number of
      reserved parking signs at most bases adds visual clutter and leads to maintenance
      problems. This problem can be solved by reconsidering the reserved parking policy and
      by changing the way reserved parking spaces are identified.
      4.9.2. Limiting Reserved Spaces. Limit the number of parking spaces reserved for
      individuals such as the base commander or senior NCO, or groups such as general
      officers. Reserve parking areas for unit personnel only if it is necessary to ensure that
      parking is available in the immediate area. Assign numbered parking spaces to personnel
      or post the entire reserved area with a sign at each entrance.
      4.9.3. References. These parking signs are intended to supplement the Manual on
      Uniform Traffic Control Devices and include freestanding signs, wall mounted signs and
      curb markings.
      4.9.4. Parking Regulation Sign Type E1 (Figure 4.39.).
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-1001 16 SEPTEMBER 2013                                             43


       4.9.4.1. Usage. Use Type E1 sign panels to identify general and restricted parking
       areas and to define specific parking regulations (such as the hours and days of
       regulation), including handicapped accessible parking places. Maintain a clear height
       of 1 500 - 2100 mm (5’- 0” to 7’ - 0”) to the bottom of the Type E1 sign panel.
       4.9.4.2. Pictographs. Type E1 sign panels use pictographs such as the “P” symbol for
       parking, the no parking symbol, or the international symbol of access for the
       handicapped as the primary graphic element.
       4.9.4.3. Verbal Message. A verbal message should be included to confirm the
       pictographic message or to add special information such as “Visitor Parking.”
       4.9.4.4. Information and Mounting. To provide additional information, use another
       sign panel below the main sign panel. Both panels should be mounted on the same
       backing sheet during fabrication. All sign panels should have rounded corners.
       4.9.4.5. Colors.
          4.9.4.5.1. Panels A, B, E, F, G and H: standard green “P” symbol and border on
          white background. Colors may be reversed if desired.
          4.9.4.5.2. Panels C and D: black “P” symbol and standard red circle with slash,
          border, and letters on white background.
          4.9.4.5.3. Panel J: white symbol, letters, and border on standard dark contrasting
          background. If there is an established color scheme for this sign type in the
          surrounding community, it is highly recommended that the same scheme be used
          on-base for easy recognition by visitors.
       4.9.4.6. Dimensions and Typography. Dimensions and message specifications are

      the entrance to a building, as shown in Figure 4.22. If the organizational emblem is used
      on a unit identification sign (Figure 4.17) or a building entry sign (Figure 4.22), it
      should not be repeated on a morale sign placed in the same area.
      4.14.4. Dimensions. 750 mm x 750 mm (2’- 6” x 2’- 6”).

Figure 4.54. Information Sign Type G2 Panel Layout




   4.17. Pedestrian Information Sign Type G3 (Figures 4.55., 4.56., 4.57.).
      4.17.1. General Information. The Type G3 Pedestrian Information Sign provides
      directional guidance for pedestrians. On training bases and on bases with campus plans,
      pedestrian circulation is often separate from vehicular circulation and requires its own
      guidance system. This sign type is also useful in large parking areas at facilities such as
      community centers and office complexes.
      4.17.2. Design Parameters. Use a separate sign slat for each destination so that messages
      can be changed without remaking the entire sign face. In cases where the sign shows six
      destinations which are not likely to change, the sign may be fabricated as a single panel.
      Separate the destinations with white rules. As shown in Figure 8.3, two different post
      heights are used with Type G3 signs. Use the 1 800 mm (6’- 0”) posts for signs with four
      to six destinations and the 1 500 mm (5’- 0”) posts for signs with two to three
      destinations. Place no more than six and no fewer than two destinations on a Type G3
      sign.
      4.17.3. Graphics/Messages. Graphics/messages should appear on both sides of the sign
      to permit viewing by people moving in both directions.
 58                           WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-1001 16 SEPTEMBER 2013


      4.17.4. Visibility. No border is used on the sign panel since nighttime visibility at high
      speeds is usually not required for pedestrian signs.
      4.17.5. Colors. White letters, rules and arrows on standard brown background.
      4.17.6. Dimensions. Slats - 150 mm x 900 mm (6” x 3’- 0”).
      4.17.7. Typography.
         4.17.7.1. Upper and lower case Helvetica medium, 50 mm (2”) capital letter height,
         flush left or right to arrow.
         4.17.7.2. The message line will accommodate a maximum of 17 tiles or characters.
      4.17.8. Rules. 3 mm (1/8”) wide white tape.
      4.17.9. Arrow. Standard tile, 75 mm (3”) high, placed left or right as appropriate.

   4.18. Base Map.
      4.18.1. Need. Most first time visitors to an Air Force base receive information at the
      entry gate. Providing a base map at the time of arrival orients visitors and helps them find
      their destinations.
      4.18.2. Consistency. The base map, direction signs and building and street identification
      signs comprise the total orientation system outlined in this pamphlet. It is essential to use
      consistent nomenclature throughout the system. The Community Center, for example,
      should be indicated by the same name on the map, the direction signs, and the building
      identification signs.
      4.18.3. Clarity. Design the map for clarity and ease of use. Maps created by merely
      reducing the base site plan are usually too difficult to read, so the site plan must be
      simplified in order to emphasize major circulation routes and destinations.
      4.18.4. Information. The destinations most often sought by people new to the base
      should be clearly named on the map. Other major destinations should be listed in a map
      legend keyed to building address numbers. Housing areas may be indicated with a
      general designation such as “Wherry Housing.” It is not necessary to draw each housing
      unit.
      4.18.5. Design. Use a halftone screen to indicate roadways. Emphasize important
      buildings by increasing the scale of the buildings in relation to other buildings or by
      adding color. See the example maps in Figures 4.58. through 4.60.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-1001 16 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  61


      4.18.6. One Point Perspective. A map drawn in one-point perspective is shown below.
      Although it is more difficult to render than a two-dimensional map, it is often easier for
      the visitor to read as it shows the buildings in elevation as well as plan. This map should
      be drawn from the perspective of the main entrance in order to aid in visitor orientation.

   4.19. Entry Control Points (ECP).
      4.19.1. Introduction. Limited use of signs in all zones and especially in the access control
      zone is strongly encouraged. Ensure position of signage does not interfere with visibility
      of security personnel, especially the overwatch position. Vehicles approaching the ECP
      should be informed of their approach to a restricted area. This may require coordinating
      signage on feeder roads with state or local officials.
      4.19.2. Speed Limit. It is also desirable to manage the speed of traffic in inbound and
      outbound lanes of the ECF for safety. Clearly post the speed limit in the ECF. Use
      geometric roadway layout features or other traffic control devices such as “rumble strips”
      or warning strips, caution signs, or traffic or flashing lights in the response zone to
      manage the speed of traffic and increase awareness of the final denial barrier system. The
      speed limit should be 25 mph (40 km/hr) or below throughout the ECF to protect security
      personnel and to minimize the potential for accidental impact with vehicle barricades.
      This speed limit also applies to the outbound lanes as they approach the vehicle
      barricades. Any deployed active vehicle barrier system has the potential to be lethal.
      Limitations on the maximum speed serve to reduce the potential for injuries or fatalities.
      4.19.3. Signage. Use of signs should be consistent with the MUTCD. Figure 4.61. shows
      the recommended signage for an ECP. Other suggested signage are below:
      4.19.4. Traffic Regulatory and Directional Signs, which control traffic flow and direct
      vehicles to specific gates, ID check lanes or the Visitors Center.
64                          WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-1001 16 SEPTEMBER 2013


     4.19.5. Entry Control Procedures Signs, which explain current ID check procedures for
     drivers; display of current FPCON status should follow Service guidelines.
     4.19.6. Variable Message Signs (VMS) at the ECF that provide the ability to inform
     motorists of roadway status or other general information per Traffic Engineering and
     Highway Safety Bulletin: Traffic Engineering for Better Gates. Locate these signs inside
     the installation and at least 200 ft (61 m ) beyond the ID check area.
     4.19.7. Warning signs, markings, object markings and delineators indicate hazards to
     users.
     4.19.8. Recommended signs for all approach, access control and response zones of the
     ECP:
        4.19.8.1. Approach Zone:
            4.19.8.1.1. Inbound Traffic: Reduce Speed Ahead (R2-5a), Speed Limit Sign
            (R2-1), Trucks Use Right Lane (R4-5 or R4-6) (if applicable).

            Way (R6-1 or R6-2), at end of transition.
            4.19.8.1.3. Both Directions: Road Closed (R11-2) Secured to both sides of gate,
            Type III Barricade marking signs, (3 per lane) secured to both sides of gate at
            installation perimeter (horizontally).
        4.19.8.2. Access Control Zone:
            4.19.8.2.1. Guide signs indicating lane use (One per lane). Type 1 Object
            marking signs on barriers for personnel protection.
        4.19.8.3. Response Zone:
            4.19.8.3.1. Outbound Traffic: Reduce Speed Ahead (R2-5a), Speed Limit Sign
            (R2-1). Warning signs should be placed a minimum of 100 feet before the final
            denial barrier, if the final denial barrier signal is not visible.
            4.19.8.3.2. Inbound Traffic: Do Not Enter (RS-1), for inbound traffic at end of
            transition, One Way (R6-1 or R6-2) for inbound traffic at end of transition.
            Warning signs should be placed a minimum of 100 feet before the final denial
            barrier, if the final denial barrier signal is not visible.
               4.19.8.3.2.1. Compliance. Comply with UFC 3-120-01 Air Force Sign
               Standard           and       USAF         symbol         guidelines      at
               http://www.af.mil/airforcestory/guidelines.shtml regarding signage for all
               new construction and renovation projects. These guidelines now mandate that
               base identification signs show only the USAF symbol and the name of the
               base or installation.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-1001 16 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                   65

      4.22.1. General Description. The size and visual prominence of water towers provide an
      excellent opportunity to exhibit a consistent, professional and recognizable image to the
      surrounding community. In order to ensure that these image qualities are achieved and
      maintained, all water tower tanks located on Air Force installations are to be painted in
      conformance with the following standards.
   4.23. Information. The face of the water tower tank shall contain only the following
   information:
      4.23.1. The Air Force Symbol.
      4.23.2. The title “AIR FORCE” in upper case letters.
   4.24. Other Graphics and Lettering. No additional graphics or lettering are to be applied.
   4.25. Colors. The paint scheme for the AF Symbol and letterforms will consist of four (4)
   colors as indicated in Figure 4.63. The background color for the body of the tank will be a
   uniform light tone consistent with installation standards.

   4.26. Proportions/Shapes. The application of the symbol and letterforms template may vary
   in overall size, but must maintain the composition and proportions as shown (see Figure
   4.63.). The shape of the letter forms are based on “Arial Black” font. The shapes of neither
   the symbol nor the letterforms are to be altered in any way.
   4.27. Visibility. Due to the diversity of water tower tank shapes, configurations and
   orientations, the following guidelines are provided in order to facilitate consistent and
   effective implementation. Number of Applications. Avoid a cluttered appearance by having
   no more than two (2) applications of the symbol and letterforms on one tank.
   4.28. Orientation. Orient the symbol and letterforms on the side(s) of the tank that provide
   the best visibility from public ways.
   4.29. Size. Size the symbol and letterforms as large as is practical so as to be easily read
   from a reasonable distance.
   4.30. Position. Position the symbol and letterforms in a manner that minimizes visual
   interference by railings or other structural elements, and minimizes distortion due to any
   vertical curvature of the tank surface.
