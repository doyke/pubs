Section 1A—Overview

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of the base radiation safety program is to establish protection
requirements necessary for the safe use of radiation producing devices and material. A properly
managed radiation protection program will minimize the incidence of exposures to radiation to
workers and the public, ensure a knowledgeable workforce exists, and maintain compliance with
all federal and Air Force regulations.
1.2. Scope. This instruction provides the responsibilities and requirements for an effective
radiation safety program for those who work with or around ionizing or nonionizing radiation.
In addition, it provides procedures to ensure the public’s safety when near radiation. Ionizing
radiation requirements apply to: x-ray emitting devices, all items on Little Rock AFB requiring a
radioactive permit or classified as a generally licensed device, and all areas that
procure/transport/store such items. Nonionizing radiation requirements apply to: 3R, 3B, and 4
lasers and radiofrequencies of 3 kHz -300 GHz.
   1.2.1. The standards and requirements in this instruction apply to occupational exposures
   and do not necessarily need to be applied to an emergency response environment.

                           RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS (RAM)

2.1. RAM. RAM are materials whose nuclei, because of their unstable nature, decay by
emission of ionizing radiation. The radiation emitted may be alpha or beta particles, gamma or
X-rays, or neutrons. If supervisors suspect or have RAM, contact BEF immediately to determine
requirements.
2.2. Template permits. Template permits are issued for devices or applications that pose
relatively little radiological risk and employ standardized permit conditions. Examples of
template permits are automatic chemical agent detector alarms (ACADA) containing nickel-63,
and Niton x-ray fluorescence (XRF) lead paint analyzers containing cadmium-109.
2.3. RAM Permit Requests.
   2.3.1. All AF organizations must obtain a RAM permit from AFMSA/SP3PB prior to
   receiving, storing, distributing, using, transferring, or disposing permit required RAM. No
   organization shall apply for a RAM permit without prior coordination with the IRSO. BE
   will provide assistance in determining whether the RAM requires a permit.
   2.3.2. All template permit requests (new, amendments, renewals, or termination) will be
   accomplished in accordance with guidance given in AFI 40-201. All requests will be routed
   through the IRSO who will route the request to AFMSA/SP3PB.

   2.5.2. All RAM requiring permit must be secured from unauthorized access or removal.
   2.5.3. Permit RSO must notify IRSO within 5 business days when they change their mailing
   address or when personnel listed on the permit such as users or RSOs permanently cease
   their duties or change their names. IRSO will notify AFMSA/SP3PB.
   2.5.4. Users of permitted RAM shall receive user training (in accordance with permit
   conditions).
2.6. Disposal/Recycling of RAM.
   2.6.1. Permitted, licensed, and other nonexempt RAM must be disposed of or recycled in
   accordance with AFI 40-201 and 10 CFR 20, Subpart K, Waste Disposal. All requests for
   disposal/recycling must be coordinated with the IRSO in writing.
 12                                              LITTLEROCKAFBI48-101 25 JUNE 2012


   2.6.2. Only the permit RSO will work with BE to dispose/recycle RAM.
2.7. Generally Licensed Devices (GLD).
   2.7.1. The NRC or agreement state (Arkansas) issues a general license to acquire, receive,
   use, store, or transfer certain devices that contain RAM which have been manufactured,
   tested, and labeled by the manufacturer in accordance with the specifications contained in a
   specific license issued to the manufacturer by the NRC. These devices are labeled as being
   generally licensed. GLDs do not require a template permit. Examples of GLDs are the
   APD-2000 chemical agent detector and Ionscan-400B.
   2.7.2. GLDs should be purchased using Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, assigned a
   National Stock Number, and registered in the Federal Logistics Information System and
   Hazardous Material Information Resource System. Local purchase of these devices is
   strongly discouraged. In either case, devices shall be registered in the Air Force logistics
   system and identified as radioactive. BE will be notified of all GLDs on base.
   2.7.3. GLDs will be leak tested biannually. BE will coordinate with shop to perform test.
   USR and BE will check on/off indicator, if any, when performing biannual leak test.
   2.7.4. GLDs must not be stored without use for more than 2 years.
   2.7.5. The USR and IRSO will ensure that GLDs are disposed in accordance with AFI 40-
   201, Attachment 10. GLDs will not be brought to DRMO for disposal.
2.8. Radiation Monitoring Equipment.
   2.8.1. Radiation survey meters used for determining compliance with Air Force instructions
   and Federal regulations must be calibrated according to ANSI guidance at intervals not to
   exceed one year. Calibration records shall be kept as prescribed in Attachment 7 of AFI 40-
   201.

                     THERMOLUMINESCENT DOSIMETRY (TLD)

5.1. NDI. NDI personnel are required to wear whole body TLD with each aircraft x-ray session
for the entire duration of the session.
5.2. Medical radiology. Medical radiology personnel are required to wear whole body and
collar TLDs for the entire duration of fluoroscopy process and whole body TLD for the entire
duration of the x-ray session.
5.3. Additional personnel. As identified by IRSO, additional personnel may be required to
wear TLDs. IRSO will take into account historical data, surveillance data, Air Force guidelines,
and precedents when deciding who to place on TLDs. Individuals who have the potential to get
more than 10% of the annual limit must be on the TLD program.
5.4. General guidelines.
   5.4.1. The workcenter supervisor must ensure TLDs are stored in the area specified by BE to
   ensure no dose is received. The location must be a clean/dry area away from all x-ray
   operations. The control badge must remain in this location at all times.
   5.4.2. Individuals need to ensure TLDs are kept in the workcenter and not worn outside.
   Excessive heat and sunlight may potentially damage the TLDs.
   5.4.3. TLDs will be exchanged by BE quarterly. The workcenter supervisor must inform BE
   when a female on the TLD program becomes pregnant. BE will then enroll individual on the
   TLD monthly monitoring program.
   5.4.4. Before being placed on the TLD program individual will provide the required
   information on the request for initial entry memorandum. This includes the worker’s social
   security number, prior work history regarding radiation, whether the individual moonlights,
   and verification of initial training. Failure to provide this information will prevent the
   worker from being added to the base TLD program.
   5.4.5. Annually, BE will provide the worker their yearly cumulative dose record. This form
   will be signed by the IRSO and individual. The form will be maintained in the BE shop and
   individual’s medical record.
5.5. TDY/Deployments.
   5.5.1. Ninety days or less: Individuals will take their dosimeter and a designated transit
   control dosimeter with them. The accompanying control dosimeter may be issued from spare
   dosimeters provided to the home base. Note: TDY badges should be hand carried onto the
   aircraft and not allowed to go through the checked and carry-on baggage scanners; the
   baggage may be subject to X-ray radiation at a level that could damage the TLDs.
   5.5.2. TDY/deployed locations with an established dosimetry program: While TDY to a
   location with an established dosimetry program, individuals will obtain necessary dosimetry
   at the TDY location. If dosimetry support is provided by other than United States Air Force
   School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) Department OEHHD, the individual is
 16                                                LITTLEROCKAFBI48-101 25 JUNE 2012


   responsible for ensuring copies of their             dosimetry    results   are   provided   to
   USAFSAM/OEHHD for inclusion in the MRER.
   5.5.3. TDY/within CONUS: Locations not having an established dosimetry program:
   individuals on TDY for periods greater than 90 days to locations without an established
   dosimetry program will receive dosimetry support from their sponsoring organization for the
   duration of the TDY. Support will necessitate providing dosimetry controls and ensuring
   exchanges are made in a timely fashion. Gaining organizations anticipating ongoing
   requirements of this nature are encouraged to establish their own dosimetry programs.
   5.5.4. TDY/OCONUS: Locations not having an established dosimetry program. Individuals
   on TDY for periods greater than 90 days to locations without an established dosimetry
   program will receive dosimetry support from the nearest location with an established
   dosimetry program. USAFSAM/OEHHD will provide additional dosimetry support to the
   location providing the support to these individuals. These procedures should be established
   before member departs TDY for OCONUS locations.
5.6. Personnel Dosimeters. As of the date of this instruction, the IRSO has set the investigative
action level (IAL) for radiation workers at 50 mrem and 10 mrem for a pregnant female. These
limits were based on approximately twice the highest level of past quarterly results and the lower
limit of detection of the TLD for pregnant workers. The purpose of these limits is to enable the
RSO to maintain ALARA exposures. Exceeding these limits does not mean the individual is
overexposed. The IRSO will initiate and conduct the investigation and report quarterly, or
monthly for pregnant females, if TLD results are at or above these set limits. The IRSO must
follow procedures outlined in Chapter 9 of AFMAN 48-125, Personnel Ionizing Radiation
Dosimetry. The IRSO may change these limits as dictated by professional judgment.
LITTLEROCKAFBI48-101 25 JUNE 2012                                                               17

                                LASER SAFETY PROGRAM

6.1. Laser classification. Laser classification is currently outdated in AFI 41-137. The
following are the updated classifications in accordance with ANSI Z136.1 2007. Classifications
provide a practical means for delineating the degree of hazard and specifying appropriate
controls for each classification. Attachment 4, table 2 provides requirements and a description of
each laser class
   6.1.1. BE must be notified of any unit owning or operating a class three or four laser, for
   addition to base laser inventory. Classification can be found labeled on the equipment or in
   the manual. BE will routinely assess and document potential laser hazards in industrial
   workplaces in accordance with their surveillance schedule. Workers will notify BE prior to
   purchase of class three of four lasers for approval.
6.2. Laser Safety Training and Controls.
   6.2.1. Refer to attachment 5 for the areas to be covered by laser safety training. Annual laser
   safety is required for users of Class 3B and 4 lasers. This training shall be documented on
   the AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, authorized versions, or an
   equivalent computer-generated product.
   6.2.2. Protective equipment.
       6.2.2.1. Enclosure of the laser equipment or beam path is the preferred method of
       control, since the enclosure will isolate or minimize the hazard. Though enclosure is the
       optimal method of control, this method may not be warranted for some systems and
       facilities (i.e., laser ranges and laser pointers).
       6.2.2.2. BE will recommend the appropriate laser protective eyewear and skin protection,
       if required, for each laser system. Not all lasers will require protective eyewear. There is
       no single eyewear adequate for all lasers. Users should not utilize protective eyewear not
       certified for use by BE.
6.3. Medical surveillance.
   6.3.1. Medical surveillance requirements are limited to personnel who work in a hazardous
   laser environment on a weekly basis. These personnel include, but are not limited to,
   laboratory personnel, aircrew, and laser range personnel. Personnel working on less
   hazardous laser classes, as defined by the ANSI Standard Z136.1, do not require medical
   surveillance and will be considered incidental personnel.
   6.3.2. Supervisors will ensure that personnel who work with the most hazardous laser
   classes, as defined by the ANSI Standard Z136.1, report to public health (PH) services upon
   initial assignment. PH will review individual medical records and make referrals for required
   medical surveillance.
   6.3.3. Pre- and post-employment medical examinations will be performed only before an
   individual’s initial assignment to laser duties and as soon as practical subsequent to actual
   termination of duties involving lasers (i.e., permanent change of station or permanent change
   of assignment, retirement, or separation). Periodic examinations are not required. Following
 18                                                LITTLEROCKAFBI48-101 25 JUNE 2012


   any suspected laser injury, the pertinent examinations, as determined by an appropriately
   qualified provider (e.g., optometrist/ophthalmologist) will be performed.
   6.3.4. Minimum exam requirements are provided in the following paragraphs. Complete
   details on the listed exams are provided in ANSI Z136.1., appendix E. The Air Force post-
   employment exam will follow the same requirements as the pre-employment exam.
       6.3.4.1. Ocular history: Review past ocular history and family history for any conditions
       related to the eyes.
       6.3.4.2. Visual acuity: Best corrected, distant and near vision should be measured.
       6.3.4.3. Macular function: Test macular function with an Amsler grid using appropriate
       optical correction to determine if distortion or scotomas exist.
       6.3.4.4. Color vision:      Use a pseudo-isochromatic plate test (red/green and/or
       blue/yellow) or similar color vision test to document color vision discrimination.
       6.3.4.5. If any nonocular abnormalities are found, a more extensive examination will be
       conducted to determine underlying pathology.
6.4. Laser overexposures: The main symptoms of laser injury are pain and a reduction in the
clarity of vision. It may not be known that lasers are in use; therefore, medical personnel should
suspect that personnel may have been exposed to lasers if the individual reports seeing bright
flashes of light, experiences eye discomfort and poor vision, and has a feeling of unexplained
heat. Obvious lesions such as corneal burns, retinal injury, retinal hemorrhage, and skin burns
make the diagnosis of injury from lasers more certain.
   6.4.1. USRs and supervisors of individuals exposed to laser radiation will follow procedures
   in paragraph 2.6.2. of AFOSH Std 48-139, Laser Radiation Protection Program.
       6.4.1.1. Individuals exposed will seek medical care, without delay, at their host medical
       unit emergency treatment facility. The laser hotline (1-800-473-3549) should be called
       ASAP because immediate indicated care is critical. The individual’s supervisor will be

            RADIO FREQUENCY RADIATION (RFR) SAFETY PROGRAM

7.1. Recognizing RFR systems. Recognition of RFR systems will be accomplished during BE
routine workplace surveillance. Shop supervisors should notify BE of any RFR systems
acquired between these periodic surveys. BE will evaluate all RFR systems on base that are
owned and operated by avionics shops, communication facilities, industrial processes, and
medical facilities.
7.2. BE will.
   7.2.1. Evaluate identified RFR systems to determine whether a system is hazardous. A
   hazardous system is one capable of producing levels above the RFR exposure limit in areas
   accessible by personnel. BE evaluation may include, but is not limited to, visual
   examination, theoretical calculations, comparison to similar systems, and survey
   measurements as necessary.
   7.2.2. BE will provide control recommendations for hazardous RFR systems.
7.3. RFR Exposures. An individual may be exposed to the RFR exposure limit without
exhibiting any damaging biological effects. The level incorporates, at minimum, a safety factor
of 10 times below the threshold for occurrence of biological effects in humans. Limits can be
found in AFOSHSTD 48-9.
   7.3.1. RFR exposure levels are established for controlled and uncontrolled environments.
   Controlled environments are workplace areas in which personnel are aware of the presence
   of RFR in their work area. Uncontrolled environments are those areas in which individuals
   have no knowledge or control of their exposure to RFR.
   7.3.2. There is no special RFR exposure limits for pregnant females. Any level RFR
   environment that is safe for the mother is also safe for the developing embryo or fetus.
   Pregnant workers will follow the requirements in their profile.
7.4. Mandatory Posting Requirements.
   7.4.1. Appropriate warning signs will be placed at all access points to controlled areas where
   RFR levels exceed the limit; signs will be visible from all directions of approach. BE will
   determine need for posting in areas where RFR levels may exceed the controlled exposure
   limit.
   7.4.2. Workplace supervisors will ensure required warning signs, safety devices, and PPE
   recommended/required by BE are functional and properly worn or placed before beginning
   work.
7.5. RFR Safety Training.
   7.5.1. Workplace supervisors will ensure workers who work regularly with or around RFR
   systems determined by BE as hazardous are trained on RFR safety upon initial assignment to
   the unit and annually thereafter. The workplace supervisor may contact BE to obtain training
   material. BE will review RFR safety materials and training documentation during routine
   workplace surveillance.
 20                                               LITTLEROCKAFBI48-101 25 JUNE 2012


   7.5.2. The training plan will include, but is not limited to: locations where the permissible
   exposure limit (PEL) can be exceeded, any new equipment/modifications or changes that can
   effect previously identified hazardous areas, control measures that must be observed by
   workers to avoid personal exposure, an overview of biological effects that can result from
   exposure to RFR, and exposure incident reporting procedures and follow-up technical and
   medical investigation process.
   7.5.3. Initial and annual training must be documented to show that employees are adequately
   trained. This training shall be documented on the AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
   Health Record, authorized versions, or an equivalent computer-generated product.
7.6. Low Power RFR. The latest version of IEEE C95.1 has updated recommendations on low
power exclusion requirements. In accordance with this guidance, whole body exposure limits for
uncontrolled areas will not be exceeded if the power of the source does not exceed 5.6W. BE
will take this into consideration when determining whether RFR systems are hazardous.
7.7. RFR Overexposure: May produce reddened or burned skin. Workers may hear “clicking”
or “popping.” Symptoms of shock and burns may be evident and should be treated accordingly.
   7.7.1. Once a responsible area supervisor has been notified of an individual(s) overexposure
   to RFR they must refer the individual to seek medical care within 72 hours of incident. The
   responsible area supervisor is also responsible for reporting the incident to BE.
   7.7.2. BE will perform investigation and reporting in accordance with paragraph 3.5.2. and
   attachment 2 of AFOSH Std 48-9, Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) Safety Program.
LITTLEROCKAFBI48-101 25 JUNE 2012                                                              21


                                           Chapter 8

                                     ALARA CONCEPT

8.1. ALARA concept.
   8.1.1. Developed in response to epidemiological and historical radiation dose data which
   suggests that no level of ionizing radiation exposure is entirely risk-free. Although there are
   federal regulations that specify acceptable, conservative levels to ensure low risk of adverse
   health effects, it is prudent to reduce exposures to the lowest levels reasonably achievable,
   thereby lowering the health risk associated with that exposure. As a result, it is Air Force
   policy that all exposures to ionizing radiation be ALARA.
   8.1.2. There should be no exposure to ionizing radiation without an expected benefit, and the
   dose received should be the lowest possible, consistent with the state of technology, cost, and
   operational requirements.
   8.1.3. The ALARA concept does not apply to lasers or RFR systems.
   8.1.4. In an effort to ensure exposures are maintained ALARA, the IRSO will conduct,
   document, and report periodic program reviews to the occupational health working group
   (OHWG) or aerospace medicine council (AMC).
8.2. General guidelines.
   8.2.1. Organizations requiring annual ALARA training will be identified by BE through
   routine HRAs. Contact BE regarding requests for ALARA training.
   8.2.2. BE will provide each organization training material specific to the unit’s occupational
   radiation hazard.
   8.2.3. Shop supervisors will be responsible for ensuring this training is documented on the
   AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, authorized versions, or an equivalent
   computer-generated product.
   8.2.4. Shop supervisors will ensure new workers are briefed on presence of radiation and
   review the ALARA training information in attachment 6 of this instruction.
8.3. NDI annual/refresher training include:
   8.3.1. Topics specified in 10 CFR 19.12.
   8.3.2. Deficiencies identified during periodic quality audits of the radiation protection
   program and unit training inspections.
   8.3.3. Review of accidents and unusual events.
   8.3.4. Review of dosimetry results (emphasizing dose reduction and ALARA)
   8.3.5. Review of basic radiation safety principles, operations, emergency procedures, new
   safety regulations, license requirements, and other pertinent information.

                  HISTORICAL OFFICE/STATIC DISPLAY MANAGER

9.1. Radiation in museum-accessioned historical property. As of the date of this instruction,
there is no detectable radiation on any of the historical property located on base. If radiation is
ever discovered in museum-accessioned historical property, whether aerospace vehicle or any
other artifact, BE will be notified. BE will conduct a survey of any new items.
9.2. Handling of artifacts. Handling of artifacts that contain RAM is not authorized. All
entries made into static display aircraft must be coordinated with the IRSO.
9.3. Radiation exposure. All displays that contain RAM should be designed to keep exposure
levels to visitors and staff ALARA. The IRSO will be the final authority on whether emissions
from any exhibit are within safe limits.
LITTLEROCKAFBI48-101 25 JUNE 2012                                                            23


                                         Chapter 10

                            OVEREXPOSURE PROCEDURES

10.1. General guidelines.
   10.1.1. Every incident involving a suspected radiation overexposure to personnel covered by
   this instruction will be investigated and documented.
   10.1.2. Immediately upon suspected overexposure BE/IRSO and medical personnel will be
   contacted.
10.2. Ionizing Radiation Overexposure: Acute health effects include burns, nausea,
weakness, hair loss, skin burns, or diminished organ function.
   10.2.1. The IRSO, once notified, will be responsible for up channeling any ionizing radiation
   overexposure investigation notification and will forward all reports and documentation
   required to the appropriate higher agencies in accordance with attachment 11 of AFI 40-201,
   Managing Radioactive Material in the US Air Force.
   10.2.2. Permitted RAM: The permittee (unit commander) is responsible for ensuring an
   investigation and a prepared report on events that involve permitted RAM is completed. The
   permit RSO, assisted by the IRSO, normally performs the investigation.
   10.2.3. Non-permitted RAM: The commander of the affected organization is responsible for
   ensuring the investigation and report have been completed.
10.3. Nonionizing radiation overexposure. Refer to Chapters 6 and 7 of this instruction for
nonionizing radiation overexposure requirements.

 Note: During maintenance and service the classification associated with the maximum level of
 accessible laser radiation shall be used to determine the applicable control measures. 1) Not
 required except for conditions of intentional intrabeam exposure applications. 2) Certain uses
 of Class 1M or 2M lasers or laser systems that exceed Class 1 or Class 2 because they do not
 satisfy Measurement Condition 1 may require hazard evaluation and/or manufacturer’s
 information (see Section 4.1.1.3).

 Class 1 laser: Considered to be incapable of producing damaging radiation levels during
 operation, and is exempt from any control measures or other forms of surveillance. An
 example of a Class 1 laser is a laser printer.

 Class 1M laser: Considered to be incapable of producing hazardous exposure conditions
 during normal operation unless the beam is viewed with an optical instrument, and is exempt
 from any control measures other than to prevent potentially hazardous optically aided viewing;
 and is exempt from other forms of surveillance.

 Class 2 laser: Emits visible light and eye protection is normally afforded by the aversion
 response (blinking, looking away from bright light). Many laser pointers are class 2.

 Class 2M laser: Emits visible light and eye protection is normally afforded by the aversion
 response, however Class 2M is potentially hazardous if viewed with certain optical aids.

 Class 3 laser (medium-power): May be hazardous under direct viewing conditions, but the
 laser light scattered off an object is not normally a hazard. It is not normally a fire hazard.
 There are two subclasses, 3R and 3B. The old classification 3A is similar, but not the same as
 3R. An example of a class 3B laser is the Adhura First Defender, a chemical detector used in
 emergency response.

Class 4 laser (high-power): Is a hazard to the eye or skin from direct beam and scatter light
may be hazardous. It may pose a fire hazard. A class 4 laser may also produce additional
hazards, such as laser generated air contaminants. Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting
Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) systems are an example of a system containing a class 4 laser.

                                       ALARA TRAINING


ALARA: All ionizing radiation exposures must be minimized or kept As Low As Reasonably
Achievable. Ionizing radiation must be strictly controlled to prevent over exposures.
TYPES OF RADIATION: Forms of ionizing radiation include x-rays, gamma rays, alpha particles,
beta particles, and neutron particles.
(Everyone is exposed to naturally occurring background radiation. ALARA training, however, seeks
to control and limit only occupational exposures to ionizing radiation.)
SOURCES OF IONIZING RADIATION: X-ray equipment and radioactive material. Radioactive
material can be found in such items as compasses, smoke detectors, and electron tubes. Radioactive
material can also be used as calibration sources for radiation monitoring instruments.
RADIATION EXPOSURE (Objects): Normally items exposed to radiation do not become
radioactive unless exposed to extremely high radiation levels.
RADIATION EXPOSURE (People): Concerns about radiation exposure focus mainly on 1) large
doses, 2) repeated exposures, 3) when large portions of body exposed, and when 4) sensitive tissues
are exposed.
RADIATION EXPOSURE (Health): Ionizing radiation can change cellular DNA and cause cell
death, tumors, cancer, and mutations.
CONTROL MEASURES: Four control measures will help radiation workers to keep exposures
ALARA. The four control measures include 1) time, 2) distance, 3) shielding, and 4) contamination
control.
TIME: Exposure to ionizing radiation is cumulative over time. Workplace administrative controls
must be used to limit the amount of time workers are exposed to radiation. Examples of work
practices used to limit worker’s radiation exposure time include 1) rehearsing a radiation operation,
2) adjusting a source’s power output to only what is needed, 3) careful management of “on” times,
and 4) prevent unnecessary “retakes.”
DISTANCE: increasing the worker’s distance from the source can minimize Exposure to ionizing
radiation. According to the Inverse Square Law, doubling the distance from the source reduces
radiation exposure by a factor of four. To maintain worker’s exposure ALARA, 1) keep personnel as
far from the source as possible, 2) establish and maintain controlled areas, 3) direct beams away from
potentially occupied areas.
SHIELDING: shielding should be placed between the source and personnel. The denser the
shielding material, the more radiation will be absorbed. Shielding should be used to protect
potentially occupied areas adjacent to ionizing radiation operations. Care should be taken to ensure
building renovations do not compromise shielding. BE will conduct scatter surveys to ensure
shielding is adequate, inform BE if processes/location changes. Proper use and maintenance of
collimators will restrict the beam to only the area of interest. When required, personnel should make
use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as lead aprons, which will provide shielding from
ionizing radiation.
CONTAMINATION CONTROL: If a radiation source is broken or leaking, workers must contact
the Base Radiation Safety Officer (RSO may be contacted during duty hours by calling DSN 731-
7398. After duty hours the RSO may be contacted by calling cell# 425-7163, or by calling the
Command Post (DSN 731-3200), or the Clinic. Personnel should also make use of PPE to prevent
contamination of skin, clothing, and to guard against ingestion of radioactive particles.
WORKPLACE ASSESSMENT: Bioenvironmental Engineering must perform a radiation exposure
assessment during initial operations involving ionizing radiation. Data gathered during this
LITTLEROCKAFBI48-101 25 JUNE 2012                                                                 35


assessment must be re-validated annually. This assessment will also include exposures to the public
in areas adjacent to the radiation operation.
EXPOSURE LIMITS: a) Workers = 5 REM per year, b) Pregnant Workers = 0.5 REM per year, c)
Public = 0.1 REM per year. If excessive exposures are identified, the Base RSO will recommend
exposure controls such as engineering controls, PPE, and administrative (work practice) controls.
All radiation exposures must be considered if personnel perform work, involving ionizing radiation,
for an employer outside the Air Force. They must report these “moonlighting” exposures to the
base RSO as well.
INFORMATION FOR WORKERS ON TLD PROGRAM
THERMOLUMINESCENT DOSIMETRY (TLD): TLD badges (or rings) are issued and worn to
determine an individual’s exposure to ionizing radiation. TLD badges can be issued on a monthly or
quarterly basis. Pregnant workers will be monitored on a monthly basis. Radiation exposures are
documented on three forms. The AL Form 1499-1 documents an individual’s exposures for the last
monitoring period. The AL Form 1499-2 documents an individual’s year to date radiation exposures.
The AF Form 1527 is sent at the end of the year. The AF Form 1527 is signed by the Base RSO and
is sent to the individual to review.

TLDs (Types): Whole body badge is worn above the hips but below the shoulders (front) and under
PPE such as lead aprons. When the TLD is not worn it should be stored with the Control Badge in
an area that is not subject to workplace radiation. The control badge is used to measure naturally
occurring background radiation levels. Background radiation levels, recorded by the control badge,
will be subtracted from a worker’s TLD measurement to determine occupational radiation exposure.
A worker’s TLD should not be exposed to sunlight or excessive heat. Electronic Personnel
Dosimeters (EPDs) are used for personnel monitoring in high radiation areas and are worn in
conjunction with TLDs.

SUSPECTED OVEREXPOSURE INCIDENT: During a potential problem, cease all operations,
secure the area, seek medical assistance, contact your supervisor/Unit RSO or safety rep, and contact
the Base RSO (DSN 731-7398 or after hours call cell# 425-7163). Each individual must complete a
statement of events which must include 1) operating parameters, 2) distances, 3) observations, 4)
times, and 5) conditions. All suspected overexposures must be reported and investigated.

FEMALE RADIATION WORKERS: The developing fetus is highly susceptible to ionizing
radiation, especially in the first trimester. Women who suspect they are pregnant must have a blood
test so they can be enrolled in the Air Force Fetal Protection Program. The program requires the
workplace to be evaluated to identify factors may adversely affect the pregnancy. Based on
workplace factors, work restrictions may be required. Women who require medical x-ray
examinations are asked and often tested to ensure they are not pregnant.

QUESTIONS: Seek your Supervisor; contact the Base RSO, or Bioenvironmental Engineering.
Bioenvironmental Engineering will have workplace information and documentation about the
radiation exposure potential. You may also review the Base Radiation Safety Instruction, AFI 40-
201, Technical Orders, Radioactive Material Permits, and 10 CFR 20, Standards for Protection
against Radiation.
