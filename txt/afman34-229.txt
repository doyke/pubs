                                                 Chapter 1

                                                OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. The AF Slot Machine Program provides a recreational opportunity to Service members
and adult family members O-CONUS locations and is also an important source of revenue to improve AF
Morale, Welfare, Recreation (MWR) programs worldwide. The AF Slot Machine Program is not consid-
ered a stand-alone program, but as another opportunity in the context of the recreational activities where
they are located. Slot machines provide a controlled alternative to unmonitored host nation gambling ven-
ues.

1.2. Operating Parameters. The AF Slot Machine Program is operated under the following guidelines:
   1.2.1. All gaming devices operated are those approved by the Nevada Gaming Commission.
   1.2.2. Top awards do not exceed $1,199.
   1.2.3. Payout percentages range from 90 percent to 96 percent.
   1.2.4. Game denominations up to $.25.
   1.2.5. The maximum wager does not exceed 10 coins.
   1.2.6. Machines are operated in both stand-alone and progressive configurations.
   1.2.7. Gross revenue (adjusted for hopper fills, hand pays, and reconciliations) is split 50/50 between
   the operating base MWR Fund and the AF MWR Fund (MWRF).

1.3. Locations. Slot machines are authorized at O-CONUS installations (excluding Alaska and Hawaii)
in clubs (officers’, enlisted, consolidated, or collocated), recreation lounges/activities at remote sites, rod
and gun clubs, bowling centers, and golf clubhouses where not prohibited by United States law, foreign
law, status-of-forces agreements (SOFA), or other country-to-country agreements.

1.4. Participation/Access.
   1.4.1. All categories of personnel authorized patronage privileges in facilities covered by AFI 34-262,
   Services Programs and Use Eligibility, attachment 1, may participate in the slot machine program.
   Sponsors are responsible for presenting proper identification for their guests. Participants must be at
   least 18 years of age to play or to be in the game area. Host country personnel who qualify under AFI
   34-262 are authorized to play slot machines, unless prohibited by SOFA or other country-to-country
   agreement, applicable local law, MAJCOM, numbered AF, or local base supplements to this manual.
   A club card, military identification card, or an equivalent form of civilian identification is required to
   play slot machines. Player eligibility requirements are verified by performing random identification
   checks. The following individuals are prohibited from playing slot machines:
       1.4.1.1. All personnel directly involved in the operation of the slot machine program and their
       families, i.e., activity and duty managers, cashiers (in the activity where they work), independent
       observers (IOs), slot machine maintenance technicians, slot machine accounting technicians, and
       other Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Accounting Office (AO) personnel with access to and control
       of slot machine keys. Slot machine program employees TDY for training or on leave at other
       bases where slot machines are operated are authorized to play slot machines at that base.

       1.4.1.2. Other individuals, when determined by the installation commander, to preclude a real or
       perceived conflict of interest, or to protect an individual from excessive and unaffordable partici-
       pation.
    1.4.2. Placement of machines, monitoring and controls.
       1.4.2.1. Slot machines must be located in a separate room or area within the MWR activity.
       1.4.2.2. In facilities that cannot accommodate a separate room, slot machines must be located in
       an area where accessibility is restricted to adults.
           1.4.2.2.1. Deviations from the above guidance will require HQ USAF/ILV approval. Request
           for deviation must include a plan of control to prevent unauthorized access to slot machines by
           individuals under 18 years of age. Deviations are discouraged, but if unique circumstances
           warranting a waiver exist, process the request as outlined in paragraph 1.6. below.
       1.4.2.3. Slot machines may not be located in isolated areas outside of direct observation and con-
       trol by facility staff in the routine performance of their duties.
       1.4.2.4. Slot machine areas must be routinely monitored by facility staff trained in policy require-
       ments governing authorized play.
       1.4.2.5. Signs stating the rules for play and access to slot machines must be posted at the entrance
       to and within all slot machine areas.
    1.4.3. Local enforcement of slot machine placement and controls.
       1.4.3.1. Commanders will take steps to ensure compliance with the above authorized policies.
       Such steps may include:
           1.4.3.1.1. Periodic patron I.D. checks.
           1.4.3.1.2. Routine documented staff observations of slot machine operations.
           1.4.3.1.3. Regular training of facility staff to reinforce knowledge of policy requirements.
    1.4.4. Review and Oversight of Controls Over Access to Slot Machines.
       1.4.4.1. Slot machine access and control will be highlighted in program oversight/review visits by
       higher-level headquarters (see paragraphs 2.3. and 2.7. for Major Command and HQ Air Force
       Services Agency responsibilities for staff assistance/oversight visits).

1.5. Gambling Abuse. The objective of the AF Slot Machine Program is to provide recreation and enter-
tainment to those customers who enjoy them, not to become a problem for those very few who might
abuse them. Should activity managers note continuing excessive play from someone who has had checks
returned for insufficient funds or has other known financial difficulties within other Services’ activities;
the individual’s unit first sergeant should be informed if the person is military or if the person is a depen-
dent, the sponsor should be informed. Great care should always be exercised in dealing with these mat-
ters. To protect individuals identified as having a gambling abuse problem from excessive and
unaffordable participation, the installation commander will restrict these individuals from playing slot
machines. Individuals with gambling abuse problems must also be referred to the base medical facility or
other resources for counseling and treatment.

1.6. Waivers, Exceptions, and Special Approvals. Identify this paragraph as the authority for waiver of
this Air Force Manual (AFMAN).
   1.6.1. MAJCOM supplements to AFMANs may limit specific base-level waiver authorities. MAJ-
   COMs may not approve waivers that prescribe base-level actions, nor may they approve blanket waiv-
   ers within their jurisdiction for their bases. Consider each waiver request separately. Only those
   procedures and guidelines that specifically reference this instruction are eligible for waiver.
   1.6.2. Waiver requests must include the following information: AFMAN directive reference, suffi-
   cient information to describe the current situation, problems encountered, proposed waiver, benefits to
   be derived, and justification.
   1.6.3. Operational and internal control waiver requests are sent through the MAJCOM Director of
   Services (SV) to the Agency Commander, AFSVA/CC, 10100 Reunion Place, Suite 500, San Antonio
   TX 78216-4138.
   1.6.4. Waivers are not implemented until formally approved. The approved waiver is placed in the
   slot machine program Life-of-the-Fund (LOF) file maintained in the NAF AO. A copy is also main-
   tained in the affected activity’s slot machine continuity file.

1.7. Appropriated Funding. Appropriated funds (APFs) are authorized to pay for transportation of slot
machines and related equipment from CONUS ports to overseas locations and from overseas locations
back to the CONUS ports (use transportation authorization code [TAC] F8P2), and for in-theater transpor-
tation of slot machines and equipment (between bases and commands). The MAJCOM assigns TACs for
in-theater transportation of machines and equipment. APFs are also authorized for communications con-

        3.2.1.7. Trash containers available for the disposal of coin wrap paper.
        3.2.1.8. Capability to support linked progressive system components.
     3.2.2. Game Room Attendant: Activity managers should use a game room attendant when there are
     multiple machine locations or a high number of slot machines with active participation. This will
     ensure quality customer service and less machine out-of-service periods especially during busy game
     room periods. Smaller activities can combine this position with the activity cashier, game room cash-
     ier, operations assistant, bartender, or other responsible position.

3.3. Machine Placement and Security.
     3.3.1. See paragraph 1.4.2. for placement of machines, monitoring and controls.
     3.3.2. Activity managers should establish separate or additional game rooms when customer traffic,
     room size, and space permit.
     3.3.3. Machines must be bolted to the machine stands at all mounting locations designed by the man-
     ufacturer. Machines must be mounted to the machine stand in a manner where there is no space
AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003                                                                               17


   between the machine and the machine stand. Stands must be bolted together on the sides or backs.
   Groups of fewer than three machines (with stands) must be bolted to the floor or wall.
   3.3.4. Electrical power for all slot machines must be provided on dedicated electrical circuits.
   3.3.5. Program administrator coordinates with the ISC, through the SVS/CC, to determine the extent
   of needed annual risk assessments for each facility with slot machines and takes appropriate action(s)
   based on the outcome of the risk assessment. The ISC will determine the need for off-cycle risk
   assessments immediately following any substantive change to the installation or activity security
   environment. Intrusion alarms and surveillance cameras must be installed in activities with slot
   machines whenever security risk assessments identify the need. Activity managers should request
   Security Forces assistance for placement of intrusion detection equipment, surveillance, or other
   physical security systems when required. A copy of the Security Forces resource risk assessment must
   be provided to the Services Commander for review and action. The resource risk assessment is main-
   tained in the slot machine LOF file. The previous resource risk assessment is moved to inactive and
   retained for 2 years.
   3.3.6. Bases are encouraged to install video surveillance in cash count rooms to monitor and record
   the cash count process.

3.4. Game Room Signage. Activity managers must post signs displaying slot machine rules and opera-
tional policies in conspicuous, highly visible locations throughout the game room or slot machine area.
The narrative must be approved by HQ AFSVA/SVP. The signs must be easy-to-read, printed in both
English and in the language of the host country, and as a minimum must include:
   3.4.1. A description/list of all individuals not authorized to play slot machines (see Chapter 1, para-
   graph 1.4., Participants).
   3.4.2. The operating hours of the game room or game areas.
   3.4.3. A statement of the associated penalties for using slugs or foreign coins in slot machines.
   3.4.4. Signs that are locally produced must be done in a manner that does not detract from the game
   room décor. Signs cannot be handwritten.

3.5. Machine Tampering and Abuse.
   3.5.1. All employees associated with the slot machine program must be especially observant and
   make every possible effort to prevent machine abuse or tampering.
   3.5.2. The following actions are prohibited:
       3.5.2.1. Placing beverage containers or other items on the machine.
       3.5.2.2. Attempting to insert foreign coins or currency in the machine.
       3.5.2.3. Covering the reel or video display area of the machine with pieces of paper, packs of cig-
       arettes, etc.
       3.5.2.4. Attaching any item to the machine.
       3.5.2.5. Striking or bumping machine with intent to damage.
       3.5.2.6. Pouring a foreign substance on or in a machine.
18                                                                       AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003


3.6. Slugs, Foreign Coins, and Tokens. Use of slugs or foreign coins (unless approved by HQ USAF/
ILV) in AF slot machines is a Federal offense under Title 18, United States Code, Section 491. This
offense is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. Tokens are not
authorized for use in AF slot machines.

3.7. Machine Malfunctions.
     3.7.1. A slot machine maintenance technician is required to resolve all machine malfunctions. A
     machine not having sufficient coins to complete a payout is not a malfunction and a maintenance tech-
     nician is not required to fill the hopper.
     3.7.2. Machines that exhibit a pattern of malfunctions similar in nature to other machines of the same
     design and manufacturer must be reported to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA when identified.
     3.7.3. Qualified slot machine program maintenance technicians are the only employees authorized to
     perform machine and associated equipment maintenance, adjustments, calibration, set-up procedures,
     testing, conversions, progressive interface connections, and technical modifications.

3.8. Machine Appearance. Activity management ensures all machines are kept clean and in a present-
able manner. This includes removal of all finger marks on the machines external metal parts and glass.
Machine interior cleanliness is the responsibility of the maintenance technician.
     3.8.1. When a machine requires maintenance and cannot be repaired immediately, an AF Form 4319,
     Out of Service Sign, must be placed on the front of the machine. The activity employee who places a
     machine “Out of Service” must complete the blocks on the reverse side of the AF Form 4319 to
     inform the maintenance technician who, why, and when the machine was placed “Out of Service.”

3.9. Training.
     3.9.1. HQ AFSVA/SVPCA is responsible for conducting detailed financial, maintenance, and slot
     operations support training. Full-time/part-time regular employees who have not satisfactorily com-
     pleted this training must be scheduled to attend within one year from date of employment. Employees
     are not fully qualified until all required training is completed.
     3.9.2. HQ AFSVA/SVPCA coordinates and schedules manufacturer technical training on an annual
     basis. To the greatest extent possible, manufacturer technical training is conducted in the PACAF and
     USAFE theaters. Maintenance technicians must satisfactorily complete formal manufacturer training
     for each machine type and design in operation at their respective base.
AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003                                                                              19


                                              Chapter 4

                            GAME ROOM OPERATING CONTROLS

4.1. Controlled Forms.
   4.1.1. AF Form 4307 and AF Form 4308 are controlled forms, tracked by number, and are purchased
   and issued to the NAF AO by HQ AFSVA/SVPCA.
   4.1.2. The slot machine accounting technician issues AF Form 4307 to the activities for daily use. All
   AF Form 4307s must be accounted for. The activity is required to turn-in the yellow copy of AF Form
   4307 to the slot machine accounting technician each duty day.
   4.1.3. The slot machine accounting technician issues AF Forms 4308 to the IOs performing the cash
   collection. The IO will return the yellow copy of AF Form 4308s to the NAF AO upon completion of
   the cash collection. The AF Form 4308 is tracked by a control number.
   4.1.4. A new AF Form 4307 must be prepared for each day the game room is open for business. All
   hand payments, hopper fills, and turn-in of coins must be recorded on the AF Form 4307 daily. The
   original copy of the AF Form 4307 is submitted to the NAF AO as supporting documentation for
   reimbursement.

4.2. Hopper Fills.
   4.2.1. When a machine’s hopper runs out of coins during a payout, the machine will complete the bal-
   ance of the payout once the hopper is refilled and the machine door is closed. All coins discharged
   from the machine’s hopper after a hopper refill must be turned in on the AF Form 4307 and annotated
   as a “completed pay-out” in the turn-in column.
   4.2.2. When a machine malfunctions and does not perform an authorized payout, the AF Form 4307
   must be annotated as a “malfunction hand pay.”
   4.2.3. When a machine’s hopper is refilled, AF Form 4307 must be annotated “hopper fill.” Hopper
   fills are authorized only in increments of 1,000 coins. Multiple 1,000 coin fills are authorized with
   each 1,000 coin fill entered on the AF Form 4307 as a separate transaction.

4.3. Hopper Empties.
   4.3.1. The complete emptying of the machine hopper may be required when a machine is moved or
   taken out of service for transfers or maintenance. In these cases, a complete hopper turn-in is per-
   formed and the AF Form 4307 is annotated as a “hopper turn-in.”
   4.3.2. When a slot machine hopper becomes empty, it must be refilled as soon as possible during the
   same business day.

4.4. Hand Payments.
   4.4.1. Hand payments occur when the slot machine hopper is empty and cannot complete the payout
   to the customer. The slot machine will experience a “hopper time-out” condition and display the cred-
   its paid and credits owed by the machine. The activity manager or duty manager must verify all hand
   payments and sign the AF Form 4307 before payment can be made to the customer. The reason for the
   payment must be annotated on the AF Form 4307, i.e., “jackpot” or “short pay.” After the activity/
20                                                                       AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003


     duty manager initials the AF Form 4307, the customer prints his/her name and signs the form
     acknowledging receipt of payment. The cashier then completes the payment to the customer and
     makes sure all of the required information is recorded on the AF Form 4307.
     4.4.2. Jackpot Hand Payments: On slot machines that are optioned to “lock-up” on top awards and
     jackpots over 4,000 coins, the activity representative will verify the jackpot and the award amount by
     reading the progressive meter or machine pay table, obtain the managers or duty managers authoriza-
     tion, and complete the AF Form 4307. Upon completion of the “jackpot hand payment”, the activity
     representative will reset the slot machine with the jackpot release/meter read key and ask the customer
     to play off the game from the machine.
NOTE: Locally developed operating instructions that would preclude machine-managed payments are
not authorized.
     4.4.3. Machine malfunction hand payments are required when bills or coins become jammed in the
     machine without giving the customer credits. When this condition is verified by an activity represen-
     tative, a hand payment is issued to the customer in the amount of the jam. The activity representative
     will complete the AF Form 4307 with a reason of “coin or bill jam.”

4.5. Cash Collection Procedures.
     4.5.1. Cash collection is the removal and counting of all coins and bills deposited into a slot
     machine’s coin drop bag and bill cassettes within the machine and stand. Cash collections should be
     scheduled on a frequency that will ensure the machine’s coin/bill storage components remain opera-
     tional. However, every effort should be made to keep them at a minimum to preclude unnecessary pro-
     gram costs. AF Form 4308, is used to document coin and bill counts, a new form is prepared for each
     cash collection.
     4.5.2. Cash Collection Procedures: Before starting any cash collection, the game room area must be
     secured to prevent unauthorized individuals from entering the cash collection area. The IO and an
     activity representative must first read, record, and verify all slot machine meter readings. The meter
     reads should be entered into the ITS PDT or manually recorded on the AF Form 4308.
        4.5.2.1. The next step in the cash collection process is to remove the cash containers. Most
        machines have both self-locking coin drop bags located in the slot machine stand and bill cassette
        stacker assemblies located within the machine itself. The activity representative removes the cash
        containers in the presence of the IO. The IO makes sure that all cash containers removed from the
        machines remain under his/her direct supervision until the cash collection/counting process is con-
        cluded. If any money (bills or coins) for any reason has not made it into the cash container, this
        money is placed into a separate cash bag and remains with the cash container it belongs to until the
        counting process is completed.
        4.5.2.2. An empty cash container must be put back in place of every cash container removed. Care
        must be taken to ensure the scan code label on the cash container matches the scan code label
        mounted on the machine’s exterior. It is the responsibility of the IO to ensure all cash containers
        access doors are locked and secured prior to leaving the game room.
        4.5.2.3. After the bill and coin containers have been removed from the machines they must be
        transported to the count room for counting. Great care must be given to security issues when trans-
        porting funds. If cash containers must be transported to another facility for counting, the guidance
        in paragraph 4.6. must be followed. If a count room is not available, the cash collection count must
AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003                                                                              21


     be done in the game room. The game room must stay secured during the collection and counting
     process. Employees authorized access to the count room are not authorized to bring personal items
     into the room during the cash collection/counting process, e.g., purses, backpacks. The IO must
     never leave any person alone in the count room with cash and must never let the money out of
     their immediate control. Once the count process is started, it must be completed before any
     employee breaks are authorized. All unusual incidents associated with the counting process must
     be reported to the slot machine program administrator and the RMFC immediately.
     4.5.2.4. The IO must verify the accuracy of the coin and currency counting machines before
     beginning the actual count. The activity representative places a known number of coins in the coin
     counter (at least 40 coins) and ensures the counter indicates the same number of coins. The coin
     counter verification test must be performed at least twice before the actual coin count is per-
     formed. The activity representative performs this test before the count of each denomination. The
     accuracy of the currency counting machine must be verified in a similar manner as the coin count-
     ing machine.
     4.5.2.5. The activity representative removes the bills and coins from the cash containers. The IO
     observes, verifies, and records the cash count. The IO ensures that the coin counter meter is reset
     to zero after counting each coin bag. Upon completion of the cash counting, the activity represen-
     tative signs the AF Form 4308 in the “Counted By” block and the IO signs in the “Verified By”
     block. If the counted cash must be transported to the main cashier cage, the activity representative
     and the IO accompany the funds to the activity cashier’s cage. A second count of all cash trans-
     ported is required. The activity cashier counts the monies and signs the AF Form 4308 in the
     “Cash Received By” block. Once the AF Form 4308 has been completed and signed by all partic-
     ipants, the IO delivers the yellow copy of the AF Form 4308 to the NAF AO. The main cashier
     completes the original copy of the AF Form 4308 along with the completed AF Form 1875 for
     deposit of the cash collected.
  4.5.3. The partial collection of cash from machines is not authorized, i.e., collecting all of the cur-
  rency (bills) but not the coins or vice versa. However, a partial collection of the cash from the game
  room is authorized, e.g., all quarter machines or nickel machines. All cash collection procedures
  required for normal cash collections are required when only collecting cash from a portion of the
  machines. Partial cash collections are not authorized for EOM collections.
  4.5.4. EOM cash collections are mandatory. Activities that perform cash collections on a bimonthly
  or monthly schedule complete the EOM cash collection on the last workday of the month. Activities
  performing one or more cash collections per week can schedule the EOM cash collection on the last
  work day of the month or on the last scheduled cash collection of the month (e.g., if an activity per-
  forms a cash collection every Thursday, and the last day of the month falls on Sunday the 31st, Thurs-
  day the 28th would be the EOM cash collection). All slot machine financial transactions (hopper fills,
  hand payments, jackpots, turn-ins, etc.) that are performed during the balance of the month (the period
  following the EOM cash collection and the last calendar day of the month) will be posted in the fol-
  lowing month’s financial transactions. This process will preclude any negative impact for the activity
  against the existing month’s revenue reporting.
  4.5.5. End of Year (EOY) Cash Collection: The EOY cash collection will be conducted on 1 October.
  A cash collection will be performed on all slot machines in operation and all machine hoppers will be
  emptied, counted, and deposited as of 30 September. The EOY hopper empty is required to accurately
22                                                                         AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003


     reflect slot machine revenues for the fiscal year and for internal control accountability. Emptying the
     machine, counting, and depositing all of the money (including hoppers) enables the accounting tech-
     nician to accurately track hopper levels and validate hopper fill transactions that have been performed
     during the fiscal year.
     4.5.6. Foreign Coins: If foreign coins are discovered in the cash containers during the count, the activ-
     ity representative will remove the foreign coins from the coin counting equipment and turn them into
     the cashier. The cashier will determine the foreign coin US dollar equivalent and post the converted
     amount to the cost center, GLAC 792.
     4.5.7. Tamper Proof Coin Storage Bags: The use of plastic, self-sealing, tamper-proof coin storage
     bags is required for storage of hopper fill coins. Coins are stored in the bags in increments of 1,000
     coins. When coins are placed in the bags, the number of coins in the bag must be verified by two indi-
     viduals, e.g., the person filling the bag and the cashier. The signature of these two individuals must be
     written on the sealed bag along with the date the bag was filled. When this procedure is followed, it is
     not necessary for the activity representative and IO to recount the coins in the bag when performing
     hopper fills.

4.6. Transport of Slot Machine Cash. Each base must work with Security Forces personnel to develop
instructions for cash transport procedures. AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program,
requires that escort procedures be determined locally and published in the Installation Security Plan. Final
determination of what is contained in the plan should take into consideration the dollar amount being
transported, threat, geographic location, distance, and route. The ISC should consider, along with other
options, transporting monies often enough to reduce the need for escorts. Procedures should also outline
actions taken when an escort is not required. This may include notifying the law enforcement desk of time
and place of departure, route of travel, destination, and estimated time of arrival. Movement of funds
off-base should be coordinated with the civil police. Additionally, ensure that the cash-transporting con-
tainer is not transparent and can be properly secured either by a locked zipper or other locking mecha-
nism.

4.7. Cash Count Rooms. If possible, all facilities with slot machines should have a separate cash count
room, other than the slot machine game room, for counting cash collected from slot machines. If a facility
is being replaced by new construction or is being renovated, a cash count room is required. As a mini-
mum, cash count rooms must:
     4.7.1. Be secure to prevent entry during cash counts.
     4.7.2. Have no windows to the outside of the building.
     4.7.3. Have sufficient space to arrange cash containers in an orderly fashion.
     4.7.4. Have sufficient electrical outlets to operate cash counting equipment.
     4.7.5. Have sufficient table/counter space for employees to maintain visibility of each other and the
     cash count process.
     4.7.6. Have video surveillance to monitor and record the cash count process.
AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003                                                                                23


                                               Chapter 5

                                        SLOT ACCOUNTING

5.1. Change Funds.
   5.1.1. Establish slot machine change funds in accordance with AFI 34-202,and AFMAN 34-212,
   Control Procedures for Protecting NAF Assets.
   5.1.2. The RMFC establishes a slot machine change fund for each activity in lieu of the activities’
   general change fund to isolate any problems with the general change fund.
   5.1.3. The slot machine change fund is used for hopper fills, hopper empties, hand payments, coins
   and bills for maintenance testing, turn-in of completed pay-outs and coin/bill jams, and ineligible top
   awards. All slot machine payouts and turn-ins are recorded on AF Form 4307. These forms are added
   together to balance the change fund and supporting documentation for replenishment of the change
   fund.
      5.1.3.1. Hopper fills, hand payments, and coins and bills for maintenance testing will always be a
      debit cash transaction against slot revenue. However, in the event coin and bill testing results in a
      win, the entire amount will be turned in and the amount above the initial issue will be a credit
      transaction against slot revenue.
      5.1.3.2. Hopper empties, completed payouts, coin/bill jams, and ineligible top awards are cash
      turned-in to the activity cashier and recorded as a credit transaction against slot revenue.
   5.1.4. The slot machine change fund is replenished as many times as necessary, but always as of the
   last day of the month. The slot machine accounting technician reviews all slot machine replenish-
   ments prior to approving payment for replenishment. All AF Forms 4307 will be posted to the activi-
   ties GLAC 503 XX .
      5.1.4.1. Activities replenish change funds by preparing the AF Form 1875, and attaching com-
      pleted AF Forms 4307, as backup. The total payouts or turn-ins will be posted as a debit to GLAC
      503 XX for the activity. Or:
      5.1.4.2. Use an AF Form 2539, NAF Disbursement Request, or a locally devised form contain-
      ing the same information, and attach the original AF Forms 4307 to the request as supporting doc-
      umentation and post as a debit to GLAC 503 XX for the activity.
      5.1.4.3. All cash overages or shortages will be accounted for in GLAC 792 XX.
   5.1.5. If the RMFC and activity manager determine the activity’s funds can be managed more effec-
   tively as a single change fund, refer to AFMAN 34-212, paragraph 5.9.

5.2. Hopper Transactions.
   5.2.1. Slot machines are equipped with an internal bowl to dispense coins for all machine payouts.
   Hopper bowls regularly discharge their full load of coins, which shuts down the operation of the
   machine, thus creating a “hopper time-out” condition. When a machine “times-out,” a hopper fill must
   be performed in order to put the slot machine back into operation.
   5.2.2. Hopper fills must be accomplished in increments of 1,000 coins to bring the hopper to the
   desired level. The cashier issues the coins to the activity employee designated to fill the hopper. The
24                                                                         AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003


     employee fills the hopper in the presence of an IO, and records the total coins of the hopper fill on the
     AF Form 4307. All lines in the appropriate blocks on the AF Form 4307 must be filled in. “Hopper
     Fills” are entered into the ITS in “Keyboard Data Entry” as “Fill Amounts” under “Hopper Fill Trans-
     actions.”
     5.2.3. A hopper empty is required for fiscal EOY reconciliation and when a machine requires a game
     conversion, denomination change, is taken off-line, or moved to another activity. The coins are
     removed from the hopper, counted, and the amount is deposited to GLAC 503 XX. The IO completes
     the AF Form 4307; noting “hopper turn-in” as the reason. The activity cashier signs the AF Form
     4307 in the payee block for the cash received. “Hopper Empties” are entered into the ITS in “Key-
     board Data Entry” as “Return Amounts” under “Hopper Fill Transactions.”
     5.2.4. Internal accountability of the slot machine hopper can be verified by running the ITS “Slot
     Machine Audit Report.” This report provides the current hopper level through the following calcula-
     tion: Total Coins-in (hopper fills + coins-in) minus Coins Paid Out, Coins to Drop, and Hopper
     Turn-ins equals the current number of coins in the hopper. This report must be run from 1 October of
     the current fiscal year to accurately reflect the hopper levels of each machine.

5.3. Hand Payments.
     5.3.1. The slot machine accounting technician validates all hand payments prior to submitting the
     EOM data to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA. Discrepancies are documented and sent to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA
     with the EOM transactions. This is accomplished by running the ITS “Hand Pay Transactions” and
     “Financial Adjustment Transaction” reports and comparing activity hand pay transactions against
     activity financial adjustments. If a discrepancy exists, research the AF Forms 4307 to identify the
     error. With the exception of progressive machines and machines optioned to lockup on high payouts,
     i.e., machines with awards exceeding 4,000 coins, all hand payments will have an offsetting com-
     pleted payout.
     5.3.2. Hand payments are entered into the ITS in “Keyboard Data Entry” under “Hand Pay” transac-
     tions. Completed payouts and cash turn-ins are entered into the ITS in “Keyboard Data Entry” as a
     “Financial Adjustment” transaction.

5.4. Cash Collection Accounting. The slot machine accounting technician will upload all cash collec-
tion transactions from the portable data collection equipment into the slot machine ITS accounting soft-
ware. If portable data collection equipment is not used, the cash collection entries posted on the AF Form
4308 will be manually entered into the slot machine ITS accounting software. The cash collection trans-
actions entered into the slot machine ITS accounting software will be reconciled with the entries recorded
on the AF Form 4308.

5.5. Cash Variances. Cash variances are the result of human error, machine malfunction, or theft.
Human errors in recording and entering meter readings, failure to report meter change transactions,
improper turn-in procedures of metered coins discovered during maintenance, and mixing a machine’s
cash containers with another machine during the cash collection process are the primary cause of cash
variances. To ensure accurate accountability and reduce the workload associated with researching cash
variances it is critically important that every effort is made to ensure absolute accuracy in all areas per-
taining to cash handling and collection procedures. Action must be taken on all cumulative cash variances
AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003                                                                                 25


on any machine in excess of $10 for quarter machines and $5 for nickel machines to correct and prevent
further occurrences.
   5.5.1. The slot machine accounting technician determines whether the cash variance is a true variance
   or an accounting variance by reviewing data entry errors, meter readings, and turn-in of currency dur-
   ing maintenance of the machine. The accounting technician must make the appropriate corrections to
   all transactions recorded in error. The previous variance report must be reviewed for offsetting vari-
   ances. If a machine experiences a variance greater than the cumulative limits of $10 for quarter
   machines and $5 for nickel machines and the variance cannot be attributed to a data collection or
   recording error, the slot machine accounting technician must submit a machine work order to the
   maintenance technician which requires all machine coin and currency processing assemblies to be
   checked for proper operation. If the maintenance technician determines the cash variance was caused
   by an internal faulty component operation, repair actions must be completed. If the maintenance tech-
   nician is unable to identify any problems with the machine and the variance continues to increase, the
   slot machine accounting technician must issue a work order authorizing the machine’s SAFE RAM be
   cleared.
   5.5.2. Small overages or shortages that never offset, or are not attributable to a known cause, may
   indicate procedural problems or possible willful misconduct.
   5.5.3. If the slot machine continues to experience unresolved variances, the slot machine accounting
   technician must take the following action(s) as may be appropriate:
       5.5.3.1. Review the slot machine collection procedures at the activity.
       5.5.3.2. Correct any procedural discrepancies.
       5.5.3.3. Submit a monthly statement of machine variances to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA.
       5.5.3.4. Document willful misconduct and contact the RMFC and Office of Special Investigation
       (OSI) for further guidance.
       5.5.3.5. Proceed with an inquiry according to AFI 34-202.

5.6. Reconciliation Procedures.
   5.6.1. The ITS “Assessment Report” will be reconciled with the activity’s Detail Posting Ledger in
   GLAC 503: “Total Count” should reconcile with the Credit Balance in GLAC 503; “Hand Pays”, plus
   “Fills”, less “Returns” and “Adjustments” should reconcile with the Debit Balance in GLAC 503; and
   “Net Win” should reconcile with the Current Period balance in GLAC 503.
   5.6.2. Slot Assessments: Once the Assessment Report is in balance with the activity’s GLAC 503; the
   slot machine accounting technician will setup the month’s slot assessment (50 percent of the Net Win/
   current period balance of GLAC 503 or the assessment total from the “Assessment Report”). Credit
   GLAC 249-00, Other Payables, for the total assessment for the base. Debit the benefiting cost center
   codes GLAC 908, Air Force Assessments, the monthly assessment. When the assessment is pulled
   through the monthly Cash Management Investment Program (CMIP) statement, GLAC 101-00, Cash
   in Bank, will be credited and GLAC 249-00 will be debited.
NOTE: If the cost center reflects a loss in slot revenues for the month (debit balance), the slot assessment
will be reversed - Debit 249-00 and Credit 908.
26                                                                           AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003


5.7. Prorating Program Expenses.
     5.7.1. All costs associated with the slot machine program are recorded in Cost Center A9. Costs
     include salaries and wages for applicable personnel (i.e., IOs and maintenance technicians), and all
     slot machine parts and supplies. Prorate these expenses from A9 to slot machine cost centers based on
     the following criteria:
     5.7.2. The coin-in per activity divided by the total coin-in of all activities to arrive at a percentage for
     factor (A).
     5.7.3. The net-win per activity divided by the total net-win of all activities to arrive at a percentage for
     factor (B).
     5.7.4. The machine count per activity divided by the total machine count of all activities for factor
     (C).
     5.7.5. The sum of (A), (B), and (C) divided by three will result in the percentage of expense’s that
     should be charged to each activity. (A + B + C divided by 3 = the percent of charges for each activity).
     This formula must be used for each activity where slot machines are operated, regardless of the num-
     ber of machines operated. This formula can be placed in a spreadsheet and updated monthly utilizing
     reports generated from the slot machine ITS accounting software.
     5.7.6. Prorate the expenses in Cost Center A9 to slot machine Cost Centers C5, D8, G5, S9, W5, X5,
     and Z5 based on the criteria established above. Use GLAC 729, Slot Machine Maintenance Expense,
     (debit) in the cost center receiving the benefit and use GLAC 801, Reimbursement from Another
     Activity/NAFI, (credit) in Cost Center A9.

5.8. Data Reporting.
     5.8.1. The slot machine accounting technician submits transaction data, RCS: HAF-SV (TW) 94101,
     (ITS CTRAN.DAT) from the ITS to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA weekly (the servicing NAF AO submits
     data for geographically separated locations with their weekly transmission). Transactions for mainte-
     nance performed between reporting periods must be submitted with the weekly data transmission. The
     slot machine accounting technician faxes the EOM Assessment Report, the Total Income Variance
     Report, the Activities Detail Posting Ledger of GLAC 503 XX, and a statement of unresolved vari-
     ances and hand payments to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA.
     5.8.2. Reporting Requirements. RMFCs may request a waiver in writing for the weekly and
     bimonthly reporting requirement for activities when the volume of play is low and it is not cost-effec-
     tive to perform cash collections on a weekly and bimonthly basis. The EOM cash collection and
     reporting requirements do not change. File a copy of all approved waivers for cash collection proce-
     dures in the activity’s slot machine continuity file and the slot machine LOF file.
     5.8.3. The slot machine ITS accounting software guidance contains the instructions for data entry,
     processing required reports, processing data, and closing the accounting month. The ITS user manual
     is provided to each base with slot machine operations by HQ AFSVA/SVPCA.
AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003                                                                                27


                                               Chapter 6

                                   KEY AND LOCK CONTROLS

6.1. High Security Electronic Key Control System. Slot machine keys and their associated controls
are the primary method of assuring internal control of slot machines. These controls require that two peo-
ple are always present anytime a machine or stand is opened for cash collections or maintenance. The
RMFC is responsible for the control of all slot machine keys.
   6.1.1. The AF slot machine program uses a high security electronic key control system to manage and
   control slot machine keys. The system consists of the KeyKeeper System software which resides on a
   dedicated personal computer (PC) in the NAF AO and a high security electronic key dispenser called
   the SKD. The use of AF Form 2432, Key Issue Log, is no longer required at bases using the Key-
   Keeper System.
   6.1.2. The SKD is wall mounted in each activity where slot machines are operated. Each SKD must
   be mounted in the activity’s administrative offices or cashier’s cage. The SKDs may not be located in
   unsupervised general public access areas.
   6.1.3. Each slot machine operating activity must have a data quality phone/modem line for direct sup-
   port of the system’s operation. Facsimile equipment may not share this line. The AC voltage power
   plug for the SKD must not be accessible after the installation is complete. All slot machine and
   machine stand program keys are kept in the SKD.
   6.1.4. SKDs may not be repaired, relocated, or moved either within the facility they are located or
   moved to another facility without specific advanced written authorization from HQ AFSVA/SVPCA.
   Slot machine maintenance technicians must be trained and certified by HQ AFSVA/SVPCA to move
   and perform minor maintenance tasks within SKDs. The RMFC initiates and submits AF Form 4310,
   AF Slot/Amusement Program Security Key Dispenser (SKD) Maintenance Authorization, to
   HQ AFSVA/SVPCA for approval to move or maintain SKDs. Approved AF Forms 4310 are main-
   tained in the slot machine LOF file.
   6.1.5. Only the RMFC and a single designated assistant are authorized access to the KeyKeeper soft-
   ware. Slot accounting technician(s), the slot machine program administrator, IOs, maintenance techni-
   cian(s), and activity employees are not authorized access to the KeyKeeper software (see Chapter 2,
   paragraph 2.13.5.).
   6.1.6. The slot machine ITS accounting software contains information on key location within each
   SKD. All keys are identified by a unique code and associated with a specific numbered key ring in the
   SKD.
   6.1.7. The slot machine ITS accounting software contains a report identifying all key locations by
   position within the SKD and will be printed for each activity manager by the RMFC or slot machine
   program accounting technician. This report is required any time changes are made to key locations.
   Two copies of this report will be printed, signed, and dated by the RMFC and the activity manager. To
   certify key accountability, each copy will be signed with one copy placed in the activity’s slot machine
   continuity file and one copy in the slot machine LOF file.
   6.1.8. Each slot machine program employee requiring key access will be issued a PIN. When keys are
   needed, the PIN must be entered into the SKD keypad to release that person’s authorized keys. As a
28                                                                        AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003


     minimum, all PINs must be changed and re-issued every 180 days. Each employee will be given
     authorization to use only the keys required to do their assigned tasks.
     6.1.9. For slot machine maintenance and activity operational tasks, e.g., hopper fills, slot machine
     maintenance technicians, IOs, and activity representatives must have access to the required keys dur-
     ing the activity’s operating hours.
     6.1.10. For cash collections, IOs and activity representatives will have access to cash collection keys
     only during specified dates and times cash collections are scheduled within the activity.
     6.1.11. When an employee enters their PIN, only the keys authorized for that employee are released.
     Certain keys have higher controls associated with them. These keys will cause alarms (audible and
     silent) to go off if not returned to the SKD by the specific time required. The SKDs have special inter-
     nal communications that supports specific key-related management tasks for both the RMFC and
     HQ AFSVA/SVPCA, for updating certain operational controls, downloading, and reporting of trans-
     action data files. Each SKD transaction is controlled by date, time, employee, and event. RMFCs and
     HQ AFSVA/SVPCA will “poll” all SKDs weekly via modem following the instructions for the
     non-network communication software contained in the KeyKeeper System. Polling sessions will
     monitor all transactions, violations, SKD status, download the transaction logs, and install any
     required system updates.
     6.1.12. Activity managers must specify the employees who require slot machine program keys and
     request key access from the RMFC. This request must include the employee’s specific slot machine
     program task(s). Once this written request is submitted to the RMFC, an authorized access level and
     PIN is assigned and entered in the KeyKeeper System controls and the RMFC gives the employee
     their PIN in a sealed envelope. The employee must sign for the PIN and return the envelope to the
     RMFC. Once the RMFC receives the signed envelope controlling the issue of the PIN, the PIN will be
     activated within the KeyKeeper System. When required, activity managers must request PIN addi-
     tions, deletions, and changes for their employees.
     6.1.13. Certain employees can be authorized to support both operational and cash collection require-
     ments. Employees requiring this type of access are issued two different PIN numbers.
     6.1.14. Slot machine program keys are considered to be compromised if a key is not returned to the
     SKD within the authorized time frame or if keys are lost or checked out by an authorized employee
     and surrendered to another employee.
     6.1.15. Compromised slot machine program keys could result in all locks and keys being replaced at
     the expense of the local MWR Fund. Activity managers must immediately inform the RMFC when
     employees no longer work in the slot machine program, when employees’ responsibilities change,
     when new employees must be added, or when access levels or cash collection schedules are changed.

6.2. Keys and Locks.
     6.2.1. Slot machine program locks used for slot machines and machine stands fall into four catego-
     ries:
        6.2.1.1. Category I – IO Cash Collection Support.
        6.2.1.2. Category II – Activity Cash Collection Support.
        6.2.1.3. Category III – IO Maintenance and Operational Support.
AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003                                                                               29


      6.2.1.4. Category IV – Activity Maintenance and Operational Support.
   6.2.2. IOs are authorized Category I keys for cash collection. Category I keys are used for access to
   the upper stand door lock (USD), bill cassette door (BCD), bill validator (BVD), left bill cassette
   (LBC), upper bill stacker door (UBSD), and the upper extractor (UE). All Category I locks and keys,
   within the confines of the base, can utilize the same lock code provided physical mounting of hard-
   ware is compatible. Attach Category I keys to SKD high security ring #1 (primary) and high security
   ring #5 (alternate) and identify with a red tag.
   6.2.3. Activity employees performing cash collection responsibilities use Category II keys. Category
   II keys are used to gain access to the lower stand door (LSD), belly glass door (BGD), right bill cas-
   sette (RBC), lower bill stacker door (LBSD), and the lower extractor (LE). All Category II locks and
   keys, within the confines of an activity, can use the same lock code provided physical mounting of
   hardware is compatible. Attach Category II keys to SKD high security ring #2 (primary) and high
   security ring #6 (alternate) and identify with a blue tag.
   6.2.4. IOs performing maintenance and operational work use Category III keys. Category III keys are
   used for access to the upper machine door lock (UMD) and, on a limited quantity of machines, the
   transport cover (TC). All Category III locks and keys, within the confines of the base, can use the
   same lock code provided physical mounting of hardware is compatible. Attach Category III keys to
   SKD high security ring #3 (primary) and high security ring #7 (alternate) and identify with a gold tag.
   6.2.5. Maintenance technicians performing maintenance and activity employees performing hopper
   fills use Category IV keys. Category IV keys are used for access to the lower machine door lock
   (LMD). All Category IV locks and keys, within the confines of an activity, can utilize the same lock
   code provided physical mounting of hardware is compatible. Attach Category IV keys to SKD high
   security ring #4 (primary) and high security ring #8 (alternate) and identify with a green tag.
   6.2.6. All requests for locks and keys are accomplished by using AF Form 4315, AF Slot/Amuse-
   ment Program Slot Machine Key and Lock Request. The RMFC approves all requests for keys and
   locks. The slot machine program administrator can initiate an emergency replacement request for
   locks via email to expedite replacement, however; an AF Form 4315 approved by the RMFC must be
   received by HQ AFSVA/SVPCA before the locks will be shipped. Although HQ AFSVA/SVPCA
   does not maintain an inventory of spare locks or keys, emergency requirements can normally be
   obtained from the supplier for shipment to the requesting base within 24 hours of receipt of the order.
   6.2.7. Bases are not authorized to keep spare locks or keys. Any excess locks and keys that result
   from key and lock replacements must be sent to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA via certified mail.

6.3. Manual Key Control.
   6.3.1. The manual key control procedures outlined below will be used at small operating locations
   and activities not converted to use of the KeyKeeper System and in those instances when the Key-
   Keeper System is temporarily out of service due to a system failure or other emergency situation. In
   situations where the KeyKeeper System is out of service, the removal of all slot machine program
   controlled keys from the SKD is required.
   6.3.2. NAF AO Key Control. The RMFC issues activity cash collection and maintenance keys to the
   activity manager on an AF Form 1297. The original AF Form 1297 goes in the slot machine LOF file
   and the copy goes to the activity.
30                                                                         AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003


        6.3.2.1. The RMFC places cash collection and maintenance keys used by the IO in separate key
        container(s) with separate container(s) for different activities. A list of keys in the container(s) is
        taped to the inside of the container(s). The IO keys are locked in the container. The key to open the
        container is maintained by the activity cashier where the slot machines are located.
        6.3.2.2. The key container(s) are issued to the office (normally base lodging) responsible for
        securing the container(s) on a separate AF Form 1297 for each key container. The original AF
        Form 1297 goes in the slot machine LOF file and the copy goes to the office securing the con-
        tainer(s).
     6.3.3. Activity Key Control. The activity manager signs for the activity maintenance and cash collec-
     tion keys from the RMFC on an AF Form 1297 and keeps the keys in a locked container, safe, or
     locker when not in use (normally in the cashiers cage).
        6.3.3.1. The activity manager or designee issues keys within the activity as described below on
        AF Form 2432. The person signing out the keys prints his or her name on line 1 and signs on line
        2 in the "Out" column.
        6.3.3.2. Game keys are issued to the operations assistant, game room cashier, or game room atten-
        dant. The maintenance door key and meter read key are issued to the on-duty maintenance techni-
        cian. Key control procedures do not allow maintenance personnel access to cash collection keys.
        Cash collection keys and maintenance keys are issued to activity personnel assisting cash collec-
        tions or maintenance.
        6.3.3.3. The activity manager or designee accepts keys turned-in by persons identified above and
        requires the person turning in keys to print his or her name on line 1 and signs on line 2 in the "In"
        column on the AF Form 2432. Activity keys are not allowed outside the activity, except to perform
        maintenance or cash collections in an activity annex.
     6.3.4. IO Key Control. The IO signs for the locked container(s) holding the keys on AF Form 2432 by
     printing their name on line 1 and signing on line 2 in the "Out" column.
        6.3.4.1. When the IO arrives at the activity, the IO and an activity employee ensures the container
        is still secure before it is opened by the activity employee. After the container is opened, the IO
        and the activity employee must inventory the keys to ensure the correct keys are in the container.
        The IO ensures each key is listed on the AF Form 2432 and signs for the keys. If all of the keys are
        removed from the container, the container may be left with the activity employee. If all of keys are
        not removed, the container must be secured and remain in the possession of the IO.
        6.3.4.2. When the maintenance or cash collection is completed, the keys are inventoried by both
        the IO and the activity employee and secured in the key container. The activity employee prints his
        or her name on line 1 and signs on line 2 in the "In" column and completes AF Form 2432. The IO
        ensures the activity employee signs the form prior to departing the activity and completes AF
        Form 2432.
        6.3.4.3. On return of the key container(s) to the office of responsibility, the IO ensures the receiv-
        ing employee signs for the key container(s) and completes AF Form 2432.
AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003                                                                              31


                                              Chapter 7

     TRANSPORTATION AND MOVEMENT OF SLOT MACHINES AND EQUIPMENT

7.1. Shipping.
   7.1.1. Slot machines and associated equipment are shipped using the most economical means avail-
   able. Government shipping channels are used to the maximum extent possible. The use of contracted
   commercial companies is authorized for all shipping to overseas bases if mission requirements dictate.
   Shipment of machines scheduled for return to the Continental United States (CONUS) for trade-in
   will be shipped following specific instructions issued by HQ AFSVA/SVP.
   7.1.2. HQ AFSVA/SVC stipulates to the originator of the shipment that all equipment shipping car-
   tons contain the required identification, shipment control documents, transportation control number
   (TCN) and tracking documents, and shipment authorization documents.
   7.1.3. Slot machines and associated equipment shipped from the manufacturer, or processed through
   the local TMO for transfer from one overseas base to another must be addressed to the receiving Ser-
   vices slot machine program administrator, who signs for the shipment.

7.2. Receiving.
   7.2.1. DD Form 250 is required for receipt of slot machines shipped from the manufacturer. The DD
   Form 250 is used as proof of receipt and must include the manufacturer’s serial number and AF prop-
   erty number and list any known damage by serial number. The DD Form 250 is signed by the slot
   machine program administrator. Receiving personnel should be prepared to take photos of the ship-
   ping containers and boxes. The signed copy of the DD Form 250 must be mailed to HQ AFSVA/
   SVFF, 10100 Reunion Place, Suite 400, San Antonio TX 78216-4138. A copy of the DD Form 250
   must also be faxed to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA.
   7.2.2. For government shipments, the slot machine program administrator annotates the DD Form
   1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, for any damages incurred during shipment and
   attaches the photographic evidence clearly showing the damage. If any of the shipment is damaged,
   the slot machine program administrator notifies HQ AFSVA/SVPCA within 3 working days of receipt
   of the shipment.
   7.2.3. HQ AFSVA/SVPCA issues instructions which are the basis for adding slot machines and
   equipment to the base’s asset listing. The RMFC establishes a locally assigned asset designator, which
   differs from the AF assigned number. The AF property number must appear in the description field on
   the local property records. Each slot machine is recorded with a zero acquisition value on the base’s
   MWR Fund property records.
   7.2.4. A copy of each DD Form 250 is maintained in the slot machine LOF file until the machines are
   transferred from the base.
   7.2.5. All new machines received must be added to the slot machine ITS master machine database
   file.
32                                                                         AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003


7.3. Equipment Transfer Between Bases.
     7.3.1. The transfer of slot machines from one base to another base is directed and controlled by
     HQ AFSVA/SVPCA. Prior to the initiation of any machine or program equipment transfer action, AF
     Form 4311, AF Slot/Amusement Program Slot Machine Transfer Authorization, and/or AF Form
     4316, AF Slot/Amusement Program Equipment Transfer Authorization, must be submitted and
     approved by HQ AFSVA/SVPCA. Approved AF Forms 4311 and 4316 are maintained in the slot
     machine LOF file.
     7.3.2. When notified of such actions, the base directed to transfer the machine(s) initiates an AF Form
     2534, by filling in the disposing NAFI, cost center, and date of the transfer blocks. The losing activity
     prepares the AF Form 2534 in 4 copies. Each entry must include the locally assigned asset designator
     along with the AF property number and machine serial number in the description field. All locks must
     be removed from the slot machine and returned to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA via certified mail prior to
     transfer.
     7.3.3. The losing activity retains copy three of the AF Form 2534, the original and copies one and two
     are sent to the gaining activity with the machine shipment. Once the gaining activity receives and
     signs the appropriate fields on the AF Form 2534, copy one is sent back to the losing activity. Copy
     one is used as the source document to remove the machines from the asset listing and the slot machine
     ITS master machine database file. A copy of the signed document is maintained in the slot machine
     LOF file at the losing base.
     7.3.4. The gaining activity completes the AF Form 2534 in the gaining NAFI and cost center blocks,
     signs for the machines in the Property Custodian, Recipient, and Witness blocks. The gaining activity
     retains the completed original as the source document to add the transferred machines to the asset list-
     ing and to update the slot machine ITS master machine database file. Copy one is sent to the losing
     activity, and copy two is sent to HQ AFSAVA/SVPCA. A copy of the signed document is maintained
     in the slot machine LOF file at the gaining base.

7.4. Equipment Movement Between Activities.
     7.4.1. Movement of slot machines from one activity to another activity on a base is authorized with
     the advance approval of HQ AFSVA/SVPCA. The slot program administrator initiates slot machine
     movement actions by submitting AF Form 4314, AF Slot/Amusement Program Slot Machine
     Movement Request , to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA for approval. Approved AF Forms 4314 are maintained
     in the slot machine LOF file.
     7.4.2. When machine movements between activities have been approved, the slot machine program
     administrator prepares an AF Form 2534. The AF Form 2534 is annotated to include the losing activ-
     ity’s cost center and the cost center of the gaining activity. Each slot machine being moved will be
     listed individually on the form to include the locally assigned asset designator along with the AF prop-
     erty number and machine serial number in the description field.
     7.4.3. The completed original AF Form 2534 is used as the source document to update the equipment
     movement in the property listing and in the slot machine ITS master machine database file. Copy two
     is sent to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA, and a copy is maintained in the slot machine LOF file. Appropriate
     activity locks must be obtained from HQ AFSVA/SVPCA prior to movement of the machine. The
     removed locks must be returned to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA.

                                                    Chapter 8

                                        DISPOSAL OF EQUIPMENT

8.1. Disposition of Slot Machines and Gaming Equipment.
     8.1.1. Slot machines and related program gaming equipment are purchased, regulated, and controlled
     by HQ AFSVA and are exempt from the NAF property disposition rules outlined in AFI 34-204, Air
     Force Services Logistics Support Program. At the discretion of HQ AFSVA, excess or no longer ser-
     viceable slot machines and related gaming equipment may be disposed of by any one of the following
     methods:
         8.1.1.1. Trade-in in conjunction with the purchase of new equipment: Machines may be traded-in
         to a manufacturer for a credit against the purchase of new machines. Trade-in values will be nego-
         tiated by AFNAFPO with the manufacturer of the new machines.
         8.1.1.2. Direct sale to dealers, distributors, or manufacturers of gaming machine equipment who
         are licensed to buy and sell used gaming equipment: Machines are sold “as is” with no warranty or
         other obligation expressed or implied by the seller (AF MWRF).
         8.1.1.3. Destruction: When the sale or trade-in value is not to the financial advantage of the AF
         MWRF and no licensed buyers make an acceptable offer to purchase machines, or if HQ AFSVA
         determines it is in the best interest of the AF, machines may be destroyed locally. HQ AFSVA will
         issue detailed guidance if destruction is authorized.
     8.1.2. Trade-ins and direct sales are negotiated by AFNAFPO. This may include delivery of the
     machine to the manufacturer or buyers place of business or be picked up by the manufacturer or buyer
     at overseas base locations. If the manufacturer or buyer elects to pick up the machines at overseas
     locations, it is the responsibility of the buyer to comply with local host country laws and customs reg-
     ulations. It is the responsibility of the buyer to pay any storage, tariffs, or duties necessary to facilitate
     the sale and transfer of the machines or equipment. Payment to the AF MWRF must be made prior to
     machines or equipment being picked up.
         8.1.2.1. Machines that are identified for trade-in within USAFE will be shipped to Ramstein AB,
         Germany for consolidation and shipment to CONUS.
         8.1.2.2. Machines that are identified for trade-in within PACAF will be shipped to Yokota AB,
         Japan for consolidation and shipment to CONUS. Machines that are identified for trade-in within
         ACC or AFSPC will be shipped according to instructions furnished by HQ AFSVA/SVPCA.
     8.1.3. The disposal or destruction of slot machines is performed only under direction of HQ AFSVA/
     SVPCA. When a base is notified to dispose of or destroy machines, the AF property tag is carefully
     removed and mailed to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA. All machine and machine stand locks and lock hardware
     (plugs, barrels, and flanges) are removed and returned to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA by certified mail.
     Machines approved for destruction must be disassembled into groups of materials such as: wood,
     plastics, wiring, electronics, metal, glass, etc. Machine EPROM’s are destroyed in such a manner that
     prevents these components from being used again. Do not attempt to use electronic equipment or
     ultraviolet light to erase existing programming within the EPROMs. EPROMs must be destroyed by
     crushing, compacting, or similar physical change, which would render the machine useless for any
     purpose other than scrap.
AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003                                                                             35


     8.1.3.1. When machines are destroyed, dispose of the scrap through the Services (MWR) recy-
     cling program or the base’s Qualified Recycling Program (QRP).
     8.1.3.2. An AF Form 2534 must be completed listing the AF property number and the manufac-
     turer’s serial number for each machine. The form must be signed by the individual accomplishing
     the destruction and witnessed by the RMFC or designee. Each signature block will include the
     typed or printed name, grade, and duty title.
     8.1.3.3. All documents relating to the destruction must contain the statement “Disposition or
     destruction of the listed equipment is IAW instructions contained in AFMAN 34-229.” Slot
     machines approved for destruction must be destroyed within 90 days of the date of approval.
     Machines approved for destruction will not be transferred to another annex or base, or placed back
     into operational status without the written approval from HQ AFSVA/SVPCA.
     8.1.3.4. After the machines are physically destroyed, HQ AFSVA/SVPCA is notified via facsim-
     ile or email that the destruction process has been completed. The original AF Form 2534 is main-
     tained at the base and is used as the source document to remove machine from the asset listing and
     to update the slot machine ITS master machine database file. Copy two is sent to HQ AFSVA/
     SVPCA, and a copy of the AF Form 2534 must be placed in the slot machine LOF file.
  8.1.4. Slot machines cannot be removed from an operational facility and placed into a storage facility
  for any reason other than prescribed disposition instructions from HQ AFSVA/SVPCA. Certain facil-
  ity renovation and/or machine maintenance may require the removal of machines and associated
  equipment on a temporary basis. HQ AFSVA/SVPCA must provide advanced approval for machine
  movements between an operational activity and a temporary storage facility. All machine mainte-
  nance must be performed within the activity that the machine is assigned to unless machine movement
  approval is obtained from HQ AFSVA/SVPCA.
  8.1.5. The local disposition of slot machine game conversion materials is authorized. Glass and reel
  strips remaining after a game conversion, and not useable as spares for other machines, may be dis-
  posed of locally. EPROMs that have been removed from the machine as a result of installing a game
  conversion kit must be destroyed (see paragraph 8.1.3.). Spare EPROMs are not authorized to be
  stored locally.

                                                Chapter 9

                        OPERATIONAL CONTROLS AND MAINTENANCE

9.1. Equipment Life Cycle.
     9.1.1. Machines and ancillary equipment are managed on a 6-year life cycle. HQ AFSVA replaces
     approximately 1/6th of the AF machine inventory each year. HQ AFSVA/SVPCA uses a technical
     specification profile to ensure all new slot machine purchases meet AF slot machine program operat-
     ing requirements. New machine candidates are tested and evaluated against these technical specifica-
     tions in the HQ AFSVA/SVPCA machine laboratory prior to purchase. New machine purchases
     normally occur during the second quarter of the fiscal year. In the process of deciding which new
     machines to buy, HQ AFSVA/SVPCA will consider requests from the bases for specific machine
     models. Slot machine program administrators are encouraged to make their desires known by submit-
     ting an AF Form 4317, AF Slot/Amusement Program Slot Machine Replacement Request, to
     HQ AFSVA/SVPCA no later than the end of the first quarter of the fiscal year.
     9.1.2. New machines may be obtained from manufacturers for field-testing for a period negotiated by
     AFNAFPO. Trial machines are tested at locations with records of high game use for the best possible
     results. Locations selected must provide HQ AFSVA/SVPCA with specified analysis data to assist in
     determining if the trial machines meet the AF slot machine program requirements for high entertain-
     ment value to customers, expected financial performance, and operational reliability.
     9.1.3. All slot machines and related gaming equipment purchased for use by the AF slot machine pro-
     gram must:
        9.1.3.1. Be commercial industry standard models, approved for use by the State of Nevada Gam-
        ing Commission.
        9.1.3.2. Have access controlled by a double lock/double key system.
        9.1.3.3. Incorporate virtual reel technology for reel-type machines and touch-screen technology
        for video machines.
     9.1.4. HQ AFSVA/SVPCA assigns each new machine an AF property number. The AF property num-
     ber is used for inventory control, revenue reporting, and machine warranty tracking purposes. Any
     property tag that has been damaged or has been removed for maintenance purposes must be replaced
     immediately. If the AF property tag becomes obliterated, dislodged, or lost, the slot machine program
     administrator forwards a request to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA for a replacement tag.
     9.1.5. HQ AFSVA/SVPCA conducts a technical inspection of all new machines at the manufacturer’s
     facilities prior to machine acceptance and shipment. A checklist is completed and attached to each
     machine exterior prior to authorizing shipment to bases.
     9.1.6. Each base scheduled to receive replacement machines appoints a slot machine program main-
     tenance technician(s) to participate in the inspection/acceptance process at the manufacturers facili-
     ties. In addition to performing the technical inspection and acceptance, the base maintenance
     technician(s) will be responsible for installing machine locks, game testing, and support by complet-
     ing the documentation required for property management records.
AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003                                                                               37


9.2. Maintenance Functions.
   9.2.1. The slot machine program administrator may schedule machine maintenance at the same time
   that activity cash collections are being conducted.
   9.2.2. The IO scheduled to perform activity cash collection duties may not be used to support
   machine maintenance. An IO assigned duties of supporting machine maintenance tasks must accom-
   pany the maintenance technician.
   9.2.3. Any machine maintenance task, game conversion, or denomination change that might include
   clearing machine memory is not authorized during activity cash collections. Hopper fills or hopper
   countdown or coin/bill testing are not authorized during activity cash collections.
   9.2.4. Machine denomination changes are performed to achieve expected levels of utilization.
   Machine denomination changes cannot be performed without the approval of HQ AFSVA/SVPCA.
   The slot machine program administrator initiates a denomination change request by submitting AF
   Form 4313, AF Slot/Amusement Program Slot Machine Denomination Change Request, to
   HQ AFSVA/SVPCA for approval. Approved AF Forms 4313 are maintained in the slot machine LOF
   file. Based on the total number of machines in operation within an activity, a minimum of six different
   game themes should be offered for each type of machine. Machine types are defined as reel or video
   machines. Fifty percent of the game themes utilized must be installed on nickel and quarter machines.
   All machines’ financial performance, using the current denominations, should be evaluated on a quar-
   terly basis by the slot machine program administrator.
      9.2.4.1. A nickel denomination machine should be converted to a quarter denomination machine
      if it is not achieving $20 daily net win and all of the quarter denomination machines are achieving
      $60/day net win.
      9.2.4.2. A quarter denomination machine should be converted to a nickel denomination machine
      if it is not achieving $60 daily net win and all of the nickel denomination machines are achieving
      $20 daily net win.
   9.2.5. Machine variances that have exceeded the limits of $10 for quarter machines and $5 for nickel
   machines must have a “Machine Variance” work order completed. Slot machine program accounting
   technicians will prepare and submit a “Machine Variance” work order to the maintenance technician.
   Two different “Machine Variance” work orders are available for use within the slot machine ITS
   accounting software with one containing an authorized maintenance procedure for clearing the
   machines random access memory (RAM). Clearing the machine RAM as a maintenance corrective
   action for financial variances is not authorized. The standard “Machine Variance” work order does not
   authorize RAM clearing; however, it requires the maintenance technician to verify all machine com-
   ponents that manage coin and bill handling components for proper operation and adjustment. Once the
   “Machine Variance” work order is completed, the “Variance Check Complete” repair code must be
   entered in the slot machine ITS accounting software.
   9.2.6. Manufacturer technical publications and HQ AFSVA field advisories contain technical set-up
   and maintenance procedures to accomplish all maintenance tasks. To supplement manufacturer tech-
   nical publications, HQ AFSVA/SVPCA also prepares and distributes Pocket Reference Guides, which
   contain the most common technical guidance and procedures.
   9.2.7. All machine and associated equipment maintenance tasks must be entered into the slot machine
   ITS accounting software.
38                                                                      AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003


     9.2.8. Preventive maintenance inspections (PMI) must be completed on all equipment following the
     manufacturers established schedules. In the event that an equipment manufacturer does not publish
     any guidance pertaining to preventive maintenance, HQ AFSVA/SVPCA will ensure a standardized
     detailed PMI schedule is developed and distributed to all bases. Locally developed preventive mainte-
     nance schedules are not authorized.
     9.2.9. Machine coin testing should only be performed after maintenance tasks associated with coin
     handling components have been completed. Coin testing is not required on a regularly scheduled basis
     to determine or verify that each machine properly processes coins. Machine coin testing is a mainte-
     nance task, which is only authorized to be performed by a maintenance technician. The maintenance
     technician conducting the coin testing must follow the procedures outlined in Chapter 5 to ensure
     proper accountability and management of funds.
     9.2.10. Machines that are connected to a linked progressive system and machines containing an inter-
     nally mounted progressive meter must be optioned following the set-up procedures outlined in techni-
     cal field advisories issued by HQ AFSVA/SVPCA. All modifications performed on machines
     connected to a linked progressive system or an individual progressive machine that may alter the
     amount of current award, may not be performed until the accumulated jackpot amount has been won
     and paid to a customer.
     9.2.11. Machines designated to be connected to a linked progressive system must be optioned to
     “lock-up” on the top award. Game themes with awards of 4,000 coins or higher must be optioned to
     “lock-up” on all payouts exceeding 4,000 coins.

9.3. Spare Parts Management.
     9.3.1. Each base-level slot machine program must maintain a spare parts inventory. High cost items
     available through the CEP must not exceed 10 percent of the total inventory maintained.
     9.3.2. The slot machine ITS accounting software must be used to control and manage all spare parts
     inventory.
     9.3.3. Annual physical inventories must be accomplished and entered into the slot machine ITS
     accounting software as physical count transactions.
     9.3.4. Quarterly physical counts must be performed on 10 percent of the inventory maintained.
     9.3.5. All slot machines have a manufacturers 2-year warranty from date of acceptance, thus eliminat-
     ing the requirements for an extensive spare parts inventory.
     9.3.6. Processing orders for slot machine spare parts to manufacturers is accomplished following pro-
     cedures established by HQ AFSVA/SVPCA. A copy of the prepared/submitted order does not have to
     be coordinated or processed through HQ AFSVA/SVPCA. Spare parts orders prepared at base-level
     are submitted directly to each vendor. Each machine manufacturer furnishes an order processing pro-
     cedure that includes a customer identification number (HQ AFSVA/SVPCA provides this information
     to the base slot machine program administrator). Manufacturers provide each requesting base a cur-
     rent price quotation, which remains valid for 30 calendar days. Certain machine manufacturers spare
     parts orders are processed under the Central Vendor Payment Program (CVPP). Under CVPP,
     HQ AFSVA/SVFFC pays all invoices. The month after the order has been processed, shipped,
     invoiced and paid; HQ AFSVA/SVFFC will deduct funds from the submitting base through the CMIP.
AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003                                                                                39


9.4. Component Exchange Program.
   9.4.1. The AF slot machine program CEP provides bases with high-dollar/high-value components
   and specific electronic components. The CEP is a “one for one” exchange of these special items at no
   cost to the requesting/using base.
   9.4.2. A custom software application is used to manage the CEP and ensures all component
   exchanges are accurately processed.
   9.4.3. All CEP management and reporting responsibilities are handled through operational centers at
   RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom and Yokota AB, Japan. Storage and direct support for ACC and
   AFSPC bases are provided by HQ AFSVA/SVPCA. RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom provides field
   storage for the direct depot support of all bases participating within USAFE. Yokota AB, Japan pro-
   vides field storage for the direct depot support of all bases participating within PACAF. HQ AFSVA/
   SVPCA provides storage for the direct support for the depots at RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom
   and Yokota AB, Japan.
   9.4.4. HQ AFSVA/SVPCA develops operational guidance for the CEP, identifying all components
   that qualify to be included in the program.
   9.4.5. HQ AFSVA/SVPCA obtains correct quantities of components to be maintained and provides
   CEP controls to ensure accountability of all materials, obtains return material authorizations (RMAs)
   from the component manufacturers and returns repaired components from the manufacturer to the
   depot bases.
   9.4.6. RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom and Yokota AB, Japan, administer base requests per guid-
   ance and procedures provided by HQ AFSVA/SVPCA, track all CEP transactions using the custom
   software, return faulty components to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA, and ship serviceable components to the
   base requesting CEP support.
   9.4.7. Bases are responsible for submitting CEP requests to the CEP depot, coordinating all local
   requirements with the CEP depot, using the special packing containers furnished by HQ AFSVA/
   SVPCA and returning the faulty components to the CEP depot.
   9.4.8. When a requesting base requires CEP support, slot machine maintenance technicians submit
   their requirement to the theater support depot on an AF Form 4312, AF Slot/Amusement Program
   Component Exchange Request. Once the depot base receives the CEP request, the CEP depot
   assigns the request a theater specific control number, enters the requested transaction into the CEP
   software and ships the requested component using in-theater shipping authorizations. Once shipping
   actions are complete, the depot base posts the transaction on AF Form 4309, AF Slot/Amusement
   Program Depot Component Exchange Log.
   9.4.9. Within 5 days after the requesting base receives the requested component, the faulty compo-
   nent is placed into the same shipping container that the new item was shipped in, and returns the faulty
   component to the CEP depot. The CEP depot sends the consolidated transaction file from the CEP
   software to HQ AFSVA/SVPCA not later than the 25th day of each month.
   9.4.10. The CEP depot contacts HQ AFSVA/SVPCA for a return merchandise authorization (RMA).
   Once the RMA is forwarded to the CEP depot, the faulty component is shipped to HQ AFSVA/
   SVPCA within 5 workdays after receiving the faulty component from the requesting base in the spe-
   cial shipping container furnished by HQ AFSVA/SVPCA. After the faulty component has been
40                                                                          AFMAN34-229 4 APRIL 2003


     repaired by the respective manufacturer, the serviceable component is shipped by the manufacturer to
     HQ AFSVA/SVPCA.
     9.4.11. When repaired components are received by HQ AFSVA/SVPCA from the manufacturer, the
     components are shipped in the special containers to the CEP depot that shipped the faulty component
     within 5 workdays. This same procedure is followed every time a requesting base submits a compo-
     nent exchange request.

9.5. Maintenance Facility Requirements. Slot machine maintenance technicians must be provided a
maintenance facility that is centrally located to all activities where slot machines are operated. The facility
must have the following:
     9.5.1. Sufficient floor space, water and restroom facilities, and electrical power outlets to support the
     testing and set-up of machines being prepared for an operational installation.
     9.5.2. Interior lighting of an intensity that satisfies safety requirements.
