Supersedes 62AWI 36-2. 1 Jun 00                                                                Pages: 5

This instruction establishes 62d Airlift Wing procedures for the nomination and selection of exceptionally
well qualified airmen for one-time consideration for promotion to Senior Airman Below-The-Zone (BTZ)
and to ensure fair, equitable and timely promotion consideration. It applies only to the enlisted personnel
administratively serviced by the 62 AW. This instruction implements the portion of AFI 36-2502, Airman
Promotion Program, that governs Senior Airman BTZ promotions.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change incorporates interim change memorandum from 62 AW/CCC dated 1 May 01. This change
provides new guidance to units designated as small units on nominations to the wing board. This change
replaces paragraphs 4.1.; 4.5.; and 4.6. in its entirety. This change also adds the authorization to conduct
“records only” boards received from HQ AFPC in regards to MPFM 01-07, dated 2 Mar 01. A bar ( | )
indicates a change since the last edition.


1. Eligibility.
   1.1. Senior Airman must meet the minimum requirements of AFI 36-2502 Table 2.1.
   1.2. The immediate commander must recommend the airman for promotion to be fully qualified for
   promotion below the zone. Qualification includes having 36 months time in service (TIS) and 20
   months time in grade (TIG), or 28 months TIG, whichever occurs first, and possessing a 3 skill level,
   unless waived according to AFI 36-2502, Table 2.3. Promotion to SrA BTZ (if selected) is 6 months
   prior to the fully qualified date.

2. Quotas:
   2.1. Quotas are established quarterly based on 15 percent of the eligibles (based on TIG and TIS
   only).
2                                                                                 62AWI36-02 1 MAY 2003


    2.2. The distribution of the unit quotas is delegated to the Flight Commander, Military Personnel
    Flight.
    2.3. Quota aggregation is not allowed. Squadron quotas may not be combined to form a group board.

3. Large Unit Selection Procedures.
    3.1. Units with seven or more eligibles will be classified as a large unit.
       3.1.1. Large units may nominate individuals for consideration by the Central Base Board (CBB)
       with the concurrence of the 62 AW Commander. If this option is selected, that unit will relinquish
       selection authority and all quotas to the CBB.
       3.1.2. Consider all individuals meeting TIS and TIG requirements, even if they are TDY, on leave
       or have projected reassignment with a Report Not Later Than Date (RNLTD) subsequent to the
       first processing month. Commander's review of qualifications and the decision whether to forward
       the member's name to the SRA BTZ board constitutes consideration.
    3.2. Commanders of large units (if not using the option in paragraph 3.1.1.) will conduct a review pro-
    cess to select their most qualified individuals for promotion to Senior Airman BTZ. The review and
    selection procedures will be exactly as described in paragraphs 4.3., 4.4., 4.5., and 4.6. The squadron
    commander will select board members only from his/her squadron.
    3.3. Once selections are made, the commander underlines the selectees’ names on the BTZ eligibility
    listing and returns it with the commander’s signature to the Military Personnel Flight (MPF), Promo-
    tions and Testing Element no later than the suspense date provided. Squadron commanders may notify
    individuals of selection upon approval by the Wing Commander via the written promotion recommen-
    dation from the MPF. The validation process will not take more than 3 days after the name is provided
    to the Promotions and Testing Element.

4. Central Base Board (CBB) Procedures:
    4.1. Units with six or less eligibles will be classified as a small unit. Unit commanders will make an
    initial quality force review using quality indicators and select/send forward only one nominee. Unit
    commanders are highly encouraged to submit the Supplemental Board Information letter (Attach-
    ment 2) to the CBB to identify any significant accomplishments of their nominee since the close out
    date of the most recent EPR. This letter is limited to nine single-bullet statements of no more than two
    lines each, (no sub-bullets) in 12 pitch New Times Roman font, with no smaller than one inch margins
    on all sides and signed by the unit commander or section commander.
    4.2. The CBB will be chaired by the Wing Command Chief or his/her designated representative,
    group superintendents or their designated representative, and a representative of any tenant unit par-
    ticipating in the CBB process. The CBB is a “records only” board (vs. personal appearance by nomi-
    nees) and will continue combining all eligibles from units with 6 or fewer eligibles at one central base
    board (vs. separate boards for tenant units in each MAJCOM).
    4.3. The CBB will use a standard score sheet (see Attachment 1) to evaluate and grade the following
    categories: Duty Performance (50 percent), Leadership Potential (20 percent), Special Recognition
    and (or) Decorations (10 percent), Education (10 percent) and Off-Duty Involvement (10 percent).
    4.4. The CBB will use only an MPF-generated data sheet, EPRs, citations of approved decorations
    and letter from the unit commander to score and rank each nominee.
62AWI36-02 1 MAY 2003                                                                                          3


   4.5. Each member of the board will score and rank order each record. Significant differences in board
   member scores will be evaluated and resolved by the chairperson. However, no member will be
   required to alter any score they have given any record unless it violates scoring rules.
   4.6. The chairperson will combine board members’ scores and total each nominee’s ranking given by
   each board member. Selectees (according to how many promotions are available) will be determined
   by those with the highest score first. If this process results in a tie, that tie will be broken by using rank
   order scoring (#1 gets 1 point, #2 gets 2 points, etc., the member with the lowest score is selected). If
   a tie still exists, add the score of the chairperson to determine final selectees. The chairperson may
   entertain discussion in the event that a majority of the board does not feel the full quota should be
   used. If a majority of the board so votes and it is approved by the chairperson, less than the full quota
   of promotions may be recommended to the AW/CC. If both of these conditions do not exist, the board
   will recommend utilization of the full quota.
