                                          POLICIES

2.1. Clearance and Sensitive Position Standard. The personnel security standard that must
be applied to determine whether a person is eligible for access to classified information or
assignment to sensitive duties is whether, based on all available information, the person’s
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that entrusting the person with classified
information or assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interest of
national security.

2.2. Military Service Standard. See AFPD 36-29, Military Standards and AFPD 36-20,
Accession of Air Force Military Personnel. It provides policies to ensure the Air Force
employs the right quantity and quality of people in the Air Force.

    2.2.1. (Added) (MILDENHALL) Military Service Standard. Commanders must ensure that
    all military personnel, at a minimum, obtain and maintain a current National Agency Check
    with Local Agency Check and Credit Check (NACLC). Commanders will evaluate the
    continued retention in the Air Force of military members subject to an unfavorable security
    clearance investigation determination (―Denied‖ and ―Revoked‖).

2.3. Criteria for Application of Security Standards. The criteria for determining eligibility
for a security clearance are listed in DOD 5200.2-R, para 2-200. Commanders apply the
criteria for security standards when granting access to classified information.

  Favorable with no derogatory reports. CNACI background checks are conducted by the
  Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
  2.4.12. (Added-USAFE) National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI). New applicants
  for the Common Access Card (CAC) will require a National Agency Check with Inquiries
  (NACI) background investigation. If the position requires a higher level investigation than a
  NACI the higher level investigation will suffice for the issue of a CAC. Current employees
  will not require a new investigation at this time. Special procedures will apply to non-US
  citizens and will be addressed by SAF/AAP at a later date.
2.5. Authorized Personnel Security Investigation Provider. The Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) is the DoD Authorized Personnel Security Investigation Provider.

                                          Chapter 3

                                SECURITY CLEARANCE

3.1. Authority to Designate Sensitive Positions. Commanders with position designation
authority determine the security sensitivity of civilian positions. Each civilian employee is
subject to an investigation depending on the sensitivity of the position to be occupied, except
for reappointment when the break in employment is less than 24 months.
  3.2.Nonsensitive Positions.
  3.2.1. The servicing civilian personnel flight (CPF) processes the initial request for NACIC’s
  to OPM for civilians occupying nonsensitive positions, not requiring access to classified
  information. OPM forwards the investigation to the CAF. Suitability determinations for
  civilian government employment are made accordingly:
      3.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) will adjudicate
      National Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit Checks (NACIC) as either
      ―Favorable‖ or ―No Determination Made‖. If the NACIC is adjudicated ―Favorable‖, no
      further action is required; however, if the Personnel Security Investigation (PSI) was
      adjudicated ―No Determination Made‖, the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) will
      perform a suitability determination. Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF) is normally the OPR
      for appropriated fund positions and Human Resource Office (HRO) for non-appropriated
      fund positions.
      3.2.1.1. (Added) (MILDENHALL) Civilian personnel (100 FSS/FSMC) will process
      the initial request for National Agency Check Plus Written Inquiries and Credit Check
      (NACIC) and Access National Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit Check
      (ANACI) for newly hired civilian personnel occupying non-sensitive and non-critical
      sensitive positions.
  3.2.2. The CAF forwards the completed investigation, OPM ―Certificate of Investigation‖
  and the OPM INV Form 79A, Report of Agency Adjudicative Action on OPM Personnel
  Investigations to the base servicing CPF.
  3.3.2. (Added) (MILDENHALL) Civilian personnel moving from a non-sensitive position
  to a non-critical sensitive position will be processed for an ANACI by the USM and
  submitted to 100 ARW/IP. 100 FSS/FSMC will provide 100 ARW/IP with a Resume and OF
  306, Declaration for Federal Employment , upon reassignment.
      3.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Information contained in an investigative report may not be
      released or disclosed to the individual investigated or to unauthorized personnel. CAF
      reports will not be released or disclosed without the permission of the CAF.
  3.2.3. The CPF:
      3.2.3.1. Determines if the individual is deemed suitable for employment IAW 5 CFR
      731.201-202. Coordination and or consultation with the supervisor and or commander
      may be made.
12                            AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


        3.2.3.2. If employee is determined suitable, CPF signs off on the OPM Certificate of
        Investigation and the form is filed in the individual’s Official Personnel Folder (OPF)
        IAW AFI 36.114, Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping.
        3.2.3.3. If applicant is determined unsuitable, CPF fills out the OPM INV Form 79A,
        Report of Agency Adjudicative Action on OPM Personnel Investigations and
        coordinates with the employee’s supervisor and or commander. CPF forwards the OPM
        INV Form 79A to OPM.
     3.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Unresolved disputes arising from suitability determinations must be
     elevated to the next higher level in the chain-of-command for resolution. Security Forces
     (SF) may dispute a suitability determination when identified or lack of information generates
     concerns pertaining to force protection and other installation and personnel protection issues.
     3.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Suitability determinations results for NACIC PSIs will be entered
     into Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) by the security manager.
     3.2.6. (Added-USAFE) During the suitability determination process, the OPR will
     safeguard all investigative reports and release only to those personnel whose official duties
     require access to them.
     3.2.7. (Added-USAFE) Other PSIs. If derogatory, unfavorable, and or potentially
     disqualifying information is identified on a Host Agency Check (HAC), Defense Central
     Index of Investigations Check (DCII), Local Files Check (LFC), or Federal Bureau of
     Investigations (FBI) check for LNs, the OPR will perform a suitability determination. The
     OPR will coordinate with the individual’s supervisor, commander, and SF to determine if the
     individual is deemed suitable for employment. Appeals for United Kingdom Defence
     Vetting Agency (DVA) denials for cause, residency or no determination made must be to
     DVA and not to/thru US agencies.
     3.2.8. (Added-USAFE) Contractor Suitability Determinations. The requirements outlined
     in para 3.2.7. above apply to suitability PSIs submitted for US contractor personnel.
 3.3. Reassignment to a Noncritical Sensitive Position. If a civilian employee is
 subsequently selected for a position requiring access to classified information and unescorted
 entry into restricted areas (noncritical sensitive), security managers process the completed SF
 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, to security forces authorized requesters.
     3.3.1. Security Forces Authorized Requesters:
        3.3.1.1. Submit the SF 86 to OPM for an ―Access NACI‖. The address is: OPM-FIPC
        PO Box 618, 1137 Branchton Road, Boyers, PA, 16018. OPM does not have the EPSQ,
        therefore requests must be sent in hard copy. Use the EPSQ at the unit, validate the
        EPSQ, and print the SF 86 for mailing. Contact the servicing CPF for any questions
        concerning Part 1 of the SF 86 or the OPM Agency Use Information Sheet. A fingerprint
        card is not required as the individual has already been the subject of a NACI or NACIC.
     3.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Investigations will be submitted via Electronic Questionnaire for
     Investigations Processing (e-QIP).
 3.4. Reassignment to a Critical Sensitive Position. If, in the future, the individual is selected
 for a critical sensitive position, security managers process the request for investigation to the
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                              13

  maintain oversight of the investigations and assist CPO when necessary. An MOU/MOA
  between the CPO and USM will be on file and maintained in the USM Handbook.
3.5. PRs for Critical Sensitive and Noncritical Sensitive Positions. The periodic
reinvestigation requirements apply to civilian employees in noncritical sensitive positions
that require access to classified information. The reinvestigation requirements apply to civilian
employees in critical sensitive positions whether or not they have access to classified
information. See Attachment 3.

      3.5.1. (Added) (MILDENHALL) All civilian Periodic Reinvestigation (PR) requests
      will be processed by the USM and submitted to 100 ARW/IP.
  3.6.Pre-employment Waivers.
      3.6.1. Sensitive Positions. Commanders must ensure procedures for pre-appointment to
      sensitive positions preclude an uncleared person from having access to classified
      information.
      3.6.2. Noncritical Sensitive and Critical Sensitive Positions (3-204). The commander or
      staff agency chief (or designee) with position sensitivity determination authority prepares
      a waiver of pre-employment investigation requirements when such action is necessary
      and in the national interest. See Attachment 6 for sample waiver memorandum. The
      memorandum is filed in the individual’s OPF IAW AFI 36-114, Guide to Personnel
      Recordkeeping.
             3.6.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Required pre-employment waivers must be completed

 5.4. Request Procedures. See Attachment 2 for the request procedures.

 5.5. Priority Requests. The following sensitive programs are authorized priority processing
 service by OPM:
     5.5.1. PRP. In cases where a PRP ―C‖ coded case warrants ―Priority‖ service by OPM, the
     authorized requester must coordinate the request through channels to AF/XOS-FI. Each
     authorized requester will maintain a fiscal year (FY) Excel spreadsheet listing for this
     purpose. The spreadsheet will include all previously coordinated FY priority PSIs and all
     new requirements the authorized requester is coordinating under this authority. When
     coordinating new priority cases, forward the entire FY spreadsheet to
     afxofi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. AF/XOS-FI will return to the authorized requester for
     monitoring the completion of the investigation.
     5.5.2. SCI. When the NACLC adjudication date is less than 12 months (DCID 6/4, Annex A,
     para 5), the servicing Authorized Requester will provide the servicing SSO a copy of the
     completed SF 86 for each SSBI request with an SCI access requirement. This will be done at
     the same time the request for SSBI/SCI is forwarded to OPM. Security
     Managers/SSOs/Authorized Requesters will expedite the processing of the SSBI off the
     installation to OPM and request priority level of service. On the OPM Agency Use Sheet
     annotate 30A in Block A. Also see AFMAN 14-304.
 5.6. Personal Data Provided by the Subject of the
 Investigation.
     5.6.1. The Air Force goal for processing personnel security investigation requests at base
     level is 14 duty days. However, commands that have extensive deployments and TDY
     requirements may establish their own internal management controls and or timelines for the
     processing of investigation requests.
        5.6.1.1. (Added-USAFE) IP authorized requesters will process and submit PSIs to
        OPM and annotate JPAS to reflect ―investigation submitted‖ within 5 working days of
        receiving a completed and correct investigation package.
     5.6.2. The subject of the investigation will provide the required documentation to the
     security manager to verify birth and education information. See Attachment 2 for details.
     5.6.3. Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA): Upon accession, IMAs complete the PSI
     during the first three days of the individual duty training (IDT) period or not later than 90
     days at the unit of assignment or attachment and turn-in to the servicing security manager
     and or gaining active duty security manager.
     5.6.4. See Chapter 8 for actions when individuals refuse to provide the required information
     for a personnel security investigation.
     5.6.5. DSS and OPM are the DOD repository of personnel security investigative files. To
     obtain a personal copy of an investigation, forward a notarized request that includes: name,
     SSAN, date of birth, and place of birth to: DSS, ATTN: Privacy Act Office, PO Box 46060,
     Baltimore, MD 21240-6060 or OPM, ATTN: FOIA, PO Box 618, 1137 Branchton Rd,
     Boyers, PA 16018-0618. The request should refer to the Privacy Act and include a valid
     return address. All signatures must be notarized. Military personnel may use a commissioned

  officer in lieu of a notary public to attest to the signature. Identify the SSN and rank of the
  officer. Also refer to AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program.
5.7. Dual Citizenship. A security concern could exist when a military member, DoD civilian,
contractor, or consultant is submitted for a personnel security investigation and they are a dual
citizen and/or possess/ use a foreign passport.
  5.7.1. Dual Citizenship. Dual citizenship in and of itself is not an automatic disqualifier for
  security clearance eligibility. However, possession of dual citizenship and particularly the
  exercise of dual citizenship is a condition that raises a security concern and may be a
  disqualifying factor in a security clearance eligibility determination. There are factors that
  could mitigate the maintenance of dual citizenship, as outlined in DoD 5200.2-R, App I,
  Foreign Preference. An individual’s expressed willingness to renounce dual citizenship is one
  of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.
  5.7.2. Possession or Use of a Foreign Passport. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport in
  preference to a US passport raises doubt as to whether the person’s allegiance to the US is
  paramount and could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the US. The security
  clearance will be denied or revoked, unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or
  obtains official approval for its use from SAF/AA. Requests for approval are forwarded
  through respective Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) channels to HQ
  USAF/XOS-FI for processing to SAF/AA. Justification must include what benefit the AF
  will gain from a person holding a foreign passport. AFCAF will annotate approvals in the
  remarks field of the JPAS.
  5.7.3. Surrendering the Passport. Individuals who indicate they possess a foreign passport in
  item 15 of the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire or item 17d on the Standard Form
  86, ―Questionnaire for National Security Positions,‖ will be required to surrender the
  passport via one of the following methods:
      5.7.3.1. Return the passport to the appropriate country embassy or consulate via certified
      receipt mail. A copy of the transmittal memo forwarding the passport and the return
      receipt will be forwarded to the AFCAF. See para 6.1. for AFCAF address. If the name of
      adjudicator assigned to the case is known, include this in the ATTN line of the address.
      5.7.3.2. Destroy the passport as witnessed by an AF security manager. Cut up the
      passport and place in a burn bag. The witnessing security manager will document the
      destruction of the passport in an explanatory memorandum, which will be forwarded to
      the AFCAF and a copy provided to the subject.
      5.7.3.3. (Added-USAFE) DELETED.
  5.7.4. Security Clearance Eligibility. In order for individuals who hold foreign passport and
  dual citizenship to be considered for and/or be granted security clearance eligibility the
  following must be completed:
      5.7.4.1. Provide a written statement expressing their willingness to renounce foreign
      citizenship claims in favor of a sole United States citizenship status. Actual
      renouncement is not required.
          5.7.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Include a copy of the written statement with the PSI and
          forward a copy to the AFCAF.
32                           AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


        5.7.4.2. Return and or destroy the passport.
     5.7.5. The renouncement statement and documentation of destruction of the passport must be
     provided to the AFCAF. The AFCAF reviews each case on its own merits to determine
     security clearance eligibility.
     5.7.6. This same guidance will apply if the passport is identified after a security clearance
     determination is made.

                                     ADJUDICATION

6.1. Central Adjudication Authority. The Air Force Central Adjudication Facility
(AFCAF) is the Central Adjudication Authority. Address is: AFCAF/PSA, 229 Brookely Ave,
Bolling AFB 20032.
  6.1.1. The policy and criteria set forth in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, paragraph 2-200, 6-102
  and Appendix I will be applied in making personnel security determinations for a security
  clearance or assignment to sensitive duties.
  6.1.2. Unfavorable adjudication results in the denial/revocation of clearance eligibility (see
  Chapter 8).
  6.1.3. The AFCAF will review all investigative products and make an eligibility
  determination.
  6.1.4. AFCAF Customer Service will not release adverse information to inquiring customers
  on pending investigations, as it invokes privacy act concerns. Derogatory issues are often
  resolved through completion of the investigation and or adjudication of the case. Premature
  dissemination of unresolved and or un-adjudicated issues could result in discriminatory
  practices with respect to such areas as employments or assignments.
6.2. Adjudicative Record. Personnel security determinations are reflected in the JPAS. JPAS
replaced Sentinel Key (SK) as used throughout AFI 31-501.

     security clearances and SCI accesses (see Chapter 11).
     7.1.2. Position Designations (7-100c). Commanders:
        7.1.2.1. Determine the level of access necessary for each military and civilian position
        based on mission needs. Each position is coded with the appropriate security access
        requirement (SAR) and identified in the unit manning document (UMD), the Defense
        Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS), and SK. See Attachment 3, for SAR code
        definitions. If the SAR code requires a change, the unit commander submits an
        authorization change request to the servicing security activity.
        7.1.2.2. Conduct a review annually to determine the accuracy of position coding,
        eliminate unnecessary access codings, and adjust SAR code appropriately.
        7.1.2.3. Record findings in the UMD.
        7.1.2.4. Ensure only necessary investigations are requested to meet mission essential
        needs.
7.2. Investigative Requirements for Coding Positions. Commanders will:
     7.2.1. Determine the type of investigation required for mission purposes for each military
     and civilian position in the organization. Investigations are required for multiple purposes: to
     determine suitability and/or trustworthiness of individual for employment/assignment to
     positions of trust/access to certain programs; and for security clearance. Each position is
     coded with the appropriate position code reflecting the required investigation level in the unit
     manning document (UMD) and the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS).
     These will also be reflected in the Headquarters Air Force Manpower Data System (HAF-
     MDS).
        7.2.1.1. Assign one of the five investigation types to each position:
            7.2.1.1.1. Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).

     7.2.1.3. Conduct annual review to determine the accuracy of position coding. The last
     AF-wide directed review was conducted in May 04. Reviews will be conducted each
     May. Retain results for review during self inspections, etc.
         7.2.1.3.1. (Added) (MILDENHALL) Coding review results are recorded in
         memorandum format and filed in security manager’s book. All Authorization Change
         Requests (ACR) to change unit manning document (UMD) codes for position
         required investigation levels will be coordinated with 100 ARW/IP.
     7.2.1.4. Ensure only necessary investigations are requested to meet mission essential
     needs.
     7.2.1.5. See Attachment 22 for additional guidance.
  7.2.2. Mandatory Secret or Top Secret requirement may be required when every position in a
  specialty is not coded as requiring access to classified information if the functional
  community can validate security access requirements for the AFSC and provide justification
  that demonstrates mandatory qualification required for mission accomplishment, such as
  access to classified information or equipment.
7.3. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs). H Q
U S A F / X O S - F I approves requests for adding security clearances or investigations as
AFSC prerequisites. Requests are staffed through ISPM channels. AFMAN 36-2105, Officer
Classification and AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted Classification will reflect an SSBI requirement
for entry, award, and retention for the respective mandatory AFSCs. See Attachment 22;
Table A22.2., A22.3..
  7.3.1. Security clearance data can be verified by the CAVS, Permanent Change of Station
  Orders, or Temporary Duty Orders.
7.4. Investigative Requirements for Sensitive Programs. There are several sensitive
programs that have been designated as a mandatory SSBI requirement, i.e., Presidential
Support, Personnel Reliability Program, etc. See Attachment 22, Table A22.4..
  7.4.1. AMS is the application used by the CAF and is restricted to CAF personnel only.
     7.4.1.1. It is a centralized database enabling CAF personnel to post adjudication results;
     security clearance determinations; access eligibility; pending actions; status of due
     process actions, i.e. security information files; statistical reporting requirements; and
     other personnel security management functions.
     7.4.1.2. Selected data fields from AMS will be available through CAVS to Air Force
     customers/ users almost immediately after input by CAF personnel and within 24 hours
     of data input by other customers/users.
  7.4.2. CAVS is the application used by MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs, ISPMs, SSOs, unit level
  security managers, and other individuals with personnel/physical security responsibilities.
  MAJCOM/FOA/ DRUs will determine those organizations and individuals within their
  organizations who will be given CAVS access. Clearance data elements in the CAVS include
  the full date and type of investigation and the full date and status of security clearance. The
  information is invalid when any of these four data elements are incomplete.

     7.4.2.1. Use the most current highest level eligibility recorded in the CAVS when more
     than one entry appears for an individual.
     7.4.2.2. An individual may have multiple SAR codes recorded in the CAVS if the
     individual is in multiple positions (i.e. civilian, reserve, or air national guard). The level
     of access given to the individual should be based on the access necessary for the position.
     Commanders make the decision on the level of access required.
     7.4.2.3. The term ―DCID 6/4 (formerly DCID 1/14)‖ means the person has been the
     subject of a SSBI, has been granted a Top Secret security clearance, is eligible for SCI
     access if required for mission essential purposes (depending on the currency of the
     investigation) and or may already have SCI access. See AFMAN 14-304.

  Forces or Special Security Office (SSO) to the SK Requirements Group through the 497
  IG/INSP, 229 Brookley Ave, Bolling AFB DC, 20332-7040.
  7.4.5. SK will be replaced with the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) which will
  be the DOD personnel security automated system that contains investigative and security
  clearance data.
7.5.     Investigative Requirements for Air Force Deployments, Operational or
Contractual Exigencies. This policy does not apply to SCI. Positions identified for
deployments will, as a minimum, be assigned a NACLC, requiring access to Secret
information for the in-country threat briefing. SSBIs are not authorized for purposes of Top
Secret eligibility ―just in case of‖ deployment. In these situations, commanders grant
interim Top Secret access for a period of up to 180 days. This can be renewed for extended
deployment purposes and for redeployment. Interim Top Secret access is granted for the
purpose of deployment based on the existing NACLC, and discontinued upon return to home
station. SSBIs will not be required for this purpose. Persons must be US citizens and have not
had a break in service for more than 24 months. Record of the interim TS is annotated in JPAS
or in cases where it is not available, documented and maintained with security related
documents. However, SSBI is authorized if a joint or theater deployment requires a final Top
Secret security clearance and will not accept interims, i.e., JCS contingencies. These
requirements need to be identified and positions coded IAW para 7.2. of this instruction.

7.6. Approval Authorities for Additional/New/Upgrade of SSBIs. 3-Star/Civilian
Equivalent authority is required to approve any additional/new/upgrade SSBIs before the

 7.7. Periodic Reinvestigations. Periodic Reinvestigations will be kept current for incumbents
 assigned against positions coded as requiring SSBI and NACLC/ANACI. Also see para A2.7..

 7.8. Issuing Security Clearance Eligibility. AFCAF issues security clearance eligibility and
 enters the determination into JPAS.
     7.8.1. (Added-USAFE) Security clearance eligibility can only be verified by JPAS or a
     properly authenticated Visitor Authorization Letter for those agencies who do not utilize
     JPAS.
 7.9. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). JPAS is the Department of Defense
 (DoD) personnel security clearance and access database. It facilitates personnel security
 management for the DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF), security managers, and
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                             39


offers both non-SCI and SCI functions. It interfaces with the investigative providers, the
personnel systems within the Department thus eliminating manual transactions and expediting
the flow of personnel security information to warfighters.
  7.9.1. JPAS is the primary source for determining investigative data/status of investigations
  on individuals in the DoD. JPAS allows communication between the CAFs and its
  customers. All information in JPAS is unclassified, but must be protected according to the
  requirements for privacy/sensitive information and For Official Use Only (FOUO) in
  accordance with AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program and DoDR 5400.7/AF
  Supplement, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program.
     7.9.1.1. (Added-USAFE) JPAS Access. JPAS is a ―US ONLY‖ program with strict
     access controls. LNs are prohibited from accessing JPAS. The IP authorized requester is
     responsible for the establishment and management of JPAS accounts for their installation,
     to include CPF, Services Human Resource Office (HRO), PRP Managers, and Army and
     Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) HRO, as required. Personnel with JPAS access
     will comply with the requirements outlines in this supplement and in the JPAS AF
     Account Management Policy. This supplement implements the JPAS AF Account
     Management as ―directive‖.
     7.9.1.1. (Added) (MILDENHALL) 100 ARW/IP is the RAF Mildenhall JPAS account
     manager.

     7.9.1.2. (Added) (MILDENHALL) 100 ARW/IP will periodically validate JPAS
     accounts by notifying JPAS account holders to justify continued JPAS access. Failure to
     respond to the notification within the allowed time frame will result in deactivation of the
     account. Each account holder is responsible for keeping the JPAS Account Manager
     informed of all changes in status and any misuse of accounts.

     7.9.1.3. (Added) (MILDENHALL) JPAS printouts will not be given to the subject of
     record or provided to anyone outside local security management (other USMs and 100
     ARW/IP). If security clearance information is required for official purposes, it can be
     provided through a JPAS visit request or by a clearance verification memorandum.
     Subjects of JPAS records may obtain JPAS printouts for their personal use by submitting
     a Privacy Act request.
  7.9.2. JPAS has two applications: The Joint Adjudication Management System (JAMS) and
  Joint Clearance and Access Verification System (JCAVS).
     7.9.2.1. JAMS is for adjudicative personnel only and provides capabilities such as case
     management/distribution, adjudication decisions, adjudicative history and summary, due
     process, and future ability for each CAF to electronically access investigative reports
     from the investigative providers.
         7.9.2.1.1. JAMS replaced the Adjudicative Management System (AMS), as used
         throughout this instruction.
     7.9.2.2. JCAVS is for non-SCI and SCI security managers/officers and authorized
     requesters and provides capabilities such as access indoctrination/debriefing history,
     incident/issue file reporting, history and management of unit personnel security functions.

            the IP authorized requester memorandum must have JPAS access.
     7.9.3. ISPMs determine the number of users and the access levels for each user. Clearance
     data elements in the JCAVS include the full date and type of investigation and the full date
     and status of security clearance. The information is invalid when any of these four data
     elements are incomplete.
        7.9.3.1. Use the most current highest level eligibility recorded in the JCAVS when more
        than one entry appears for an individual.
        7.9.3.2. The term ―DCID 6/4 (formerly DCID 1/14)‖ means the person has been the
        subject of a SSBI, has been granted a Top Secret security clearance eligibility, is eligible
        for SCI access if required for mission essential purposes and may already have SCI

  JPAS. In situations where no security clearance data is available at the unit, no information is
  available in the JCAVS, and the AFCAF has valid security clearance information on file, a
  record of the call will be used as evidence of valid clearance data pending update of the
  JCAVS. The authorized requester prepares a memorandum for record (MFR) showing: (1)
  name, grade, and organization of the individual calling the AFCAF; (2) name, grade,
  organization, and SSN of the subject; (3) name of person at the AFCAF providing clearance
  eligibility data, and (4) type and date of investigation and, if granted, level and date of
  security clearance eligibility. Also see para 6.1..
      7.12.1.1. The authorized requester forwards a copy of the MFR to the individual's
      security manager.
             7.12.1.1.1. (Added) (MILDENHALL) Assigned personnel (except 100 ARW/IP
             authorized requestors) will not contact the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility
             (AFCAF) or Office of Personnel Management (OPM) directly. All questions for
             the AFCAF and OPM will first be forwarded to through the USM to 100 ARW/IP
             for resolution.
      7.12.1.2. The authorized requester and the security manager keep the MFR until JCAVS
      is updated to show the data addressed in the MFR.
      7.12.1.3. (Added-USAFE) E-mail notification is sufficient in lieu of a memorandum for
      record (MFR).
  7.12.2. (Added-USAFE) JPAS Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility Requests (RRU).
  USMs will submit Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility Requests in JPAS to the
  AFCAF prior to seeking assistance for the IP authorized requester. In most cases, the
  AFCAF response to the RRU in JPAS will provide the required information; however, if
  further information or clarification is needed, the USM will contact the IP authorized
  requester for assistance.
      7.12.2.1. (Added-USAFE) IP authorized requesters should only call the AFCAF after
      verifying the issue could not be resolved by the USM through JPAS.
  7.12.3. (Added-USAFE) Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility Requests in JPAS will
  not be submitted to the CAF until the PSI has been closed at the investigative agency for at
  least 120 days. Additionally, Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility Requests in JPAS
  will not be submitted for any PRP PSI’s.
44                           AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


     7.12.4. (Added-USAFE) Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility Requests will not be
     submitted to the CAF to inquire on the status of a PSI that has been submitted to or open at
     an investigative agency. The CAF is strictly an adjudication facility and has no control over
     investigative agencies. Additionally, Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility Requests will
     not be submitted to the CAF to request personnel data changes in JPAS; such as date of birth,
     place of birth, name changes, unit of assignment, etc.
7.13. (Added-USAFE) JPAS Eligibility Changes. USMs will check the eligibility change
portion of the JPAS Notifications web page frequently to ensure changes are promptly noted and
appropriate action, if any, is taken.
7.13. (Added) (MILDENHALL) USMs will ensure personnel assigned or TDY to their unit for
30 days or more are in and out-processed through the USMs office. USM will establish a
servicing relationship for TDY personnel.
7.14. (Added-USAFE) JPAS Personnel Security Management Network (PSM-Net). As a
minimum, IP Authorized requesters will ensure all units and organizations, to include supported
Geographically Separated Units (GSU) are properly serviced within PSM-Net. Additionally, IP
authorized requesters and ISPMs will ensure all units and organizations, to include supported
GSUs have properly established ―ownership‖ or ―servicing‖ of their assigned and/or deployed
personnel assigned to the unit for a period of 30 days or more in their respective JPAS Security
Management Office (SMO).

                                          Chapter 8

                    UNFAVORABLE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS

8.1. Referral for Action.
  8.1.1. Security Information File (SIF). A SIF is a collection of documents generated as a
  result of the discovery or development of unfavorable information which brings into question
  a person’s continuing eligibility for a security clearance or access to SCI. It may be
  established by a commander, civilian equivalent, or by the CAF. The SIF serves as a
  repository for unfavorable or derogatory information that requires further review, evaluation,
  or investigation to resolve outstanding administrative or adjudicative concerns. Report
  administrative change of status information for individuals with SCI access according to
  AFMAN 14-304.
  8.1.2. Reporting Government Charge Card Abuses and Misuse. Security Officials, AFOSI,
  or AF Government Charge Card program coordinators are required to immediately report
  Government Charge Card abuses and misuses to the appropriate commander. This
  information constitutes serious questions as to the individual’s ability or intent to protect
  classified information or execute sensitive duties. The commander will make an immediate
  determination to either leave the individual’s security status unchanged or suspend their
  access to classified information or assignment to sensitive duties until the appropriate
  authority makes a final determination regarding the individual’s eligibility to retain a security
  clearance. In addition, commanders may take action in accordance with Chapter 8, to
  determine if a SIF should be established and/or the person’s access to classified information
  should be suspended.
  8.1.3. Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances as
  Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001
  – Smith Amendment. Attachment 24 outlines the instructions.
8.2. Suspension.
  8.2.1. Commander:
      8.2.1.1. Reviews unfavorable information on individuals under the commander’s
      jurisdiction when reported or developed which would directly impact an individual’s
      security clearance or SCI access, to include the following (see Attachment 11 for sample
      memorandum):
         8.2.1.1.1. Activities’ tenant or geographically separated units.
             8.2.1.1.1.1. (Added) (MILDENHALL) 100 ARW/IP will forward a letter or
             email to the subject’s unit commander on derogatory information, or potentially
             derogatory information. Commanders must evaluate information for continuation
             of security clearance eligibility and whether a SIF should be established. Within
             20 calendar days, the unit commander must complete the endorsement and return
             it to 100 ARW/IP. In the event of a disagreement, the decision may be elevated to
             the 100 ARW/CC. Suspense may be extended up to 45 days if the commander
             has sufficient reason to doubt the validity of the unfavorable information.
46                        AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


        8.2.1.1.2. TDY personnel.
     8.2.1.2. Establishes a SIF when an individual’s activity, conduct or behavior is
     inconsistent with the security criteria specified in DOD 5200.2-R, para 2-200 and
     Appendix I. See Attachment 12 for sample request for SIF establishment to the servicing
     security activity.
     8.2.1.3. Determines whether or not to establish a SIF on a case by case basis, normally
     within 20 days of receipt of unfavorable information (as soon as possible if SCI access is
     involved). This decision is made by considering the seriousness of the incident; the
     individual’s motivation; whether it was out of character for the individual; or whether the
     undesirable conduct or behavior is likely to continue. Coordination and consultation with
     the chief of the servicing security activity, SSO (for SCI access) or program security
     officer (for SAP access) and legal representatives is recommended. However, if the
     commander has sufficient reason to doubt the validity of unfavorable information the
     decision to establish a SIF and notification to the CAF may be extended up to 45 days. If
     the servicing security activity and the commander disagree on establishment of a SIF,
     elevate the issue to the installation commander for resolution. Once a SIF is formally
     established it must be processed accordingly and only the CAF has closure authority.
        8.2.1.3.1. Examples of reasons to establish a SIF are outlined in para 2-200, DOD
        5200.2-R and include the following:
            8.2.1.3.1.1. Refusal to sign a required SF 312 or other nondisclosure agreement.
            8.2.1.3.1.2. Refusal or intentional failure of an individual requiring an
            investigation or periodic reinvestigation to provide the personnel security
            questionnaire information or release statements for review of medical, financial,
            or employment records.
            8.2.1.3.1.3. Refusal by an individual to be interviewed in connection with a
            personnel security investigation, regardless of whether the information is
            requested by the investigative agency or the CAF.
            8.2.1.3.1.4. Incidents of theft, embezzlement, child or spouse abuse, unauthorized
            sale or use of firearms, explosives, or dangerous weapons, or misuse or improper
            disposition of government property or other unlawful activities.
            8.2.1.3.1.5. Information leading to permanent decertification from PRP for other
            than physical reasons.
        8.2.1.3.2. The following are some examples of reasons that may not warrant
        establishment of a SIF:
            8.2.1.3.2.1. Minor traffic violations.
            8.2.1.3.2.2. Minor one-time alcohol related incident.
            8.2.1.3.2.3. Permanent decertification from PRP related to medical reasons of a
            physical nature.
            8.2.1.3.2.4. Disciplinary issues; such as failure to repair; poor duty performance;
            failure to maintain weight standards; and any single isolated incident of poor
            judgment based on immaturity or extenuating circumstances which does not
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                            47


            impact on the individual’s ability to safeguard classified information.
            8.2.1.3.2.5. Federal civilian employees occupying nonsensitive positions.
            8.2.1.3.2.6. Incidents where a SIF has already been established by the CAF based
            on the same unfavorable information.
     8.2.1.4. Determines whether or not to initiate suspension action for the individual’s
     access to classified information upon establishment of a SIF. If the decision is to suspend
     the person’s access to classified information the same decision automatically applies to
     the SCI and SAP access. The access to classified information and SCI is considered one
     under the new DOD personnel security common adjudicative guidelines. Additionally,
     the commander determines suspension of unescorted entry to restricted areas if
     applicable. The determination to suspend should be based on a thorough review of the
     facts and an assessment of the risk to national security. For SCI access see AFMAN 14-
     304 and DOD S-5105.21-M-1, Sensitive Compartmented Information Administrative
     Manual.
         8.2.1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) If a person's JPAS person summary shows "Action
         Pending" or "Access Suspended" all access to classified information, to include
         NATO classified information must be immediately withdrawn. The unit commander
         or equivalent is responsible for ensuring all access to classified information is
         withdrawn when an individual’s security clearance eligibility is suspended by the
         CAF.
     8.2.1.5. Notifies the individual accordingly with information copy to the servicing
     security activity. See Attachment 13 and Attachment 14 for sample memorandums.
     8.2.1.6. Requests AFOSI investigation, if criminal activity is involved.
     8.2.1.7. Includes a recommendation whether to grant, reinstate, deny, or revoke the
     individual’s security clearance and or SCI/SAP access and the rationale for the decision
     in the completed SIF. The documented facts must fully support the recommendation.
     Refer to DOD 5200.2-R, Appendix I, Adjudicative Guidelines.
     8.2.1.8. Requests the CAF to immediately close a SIF favorably via priority message
     (through the MAJCOM or activity SSO for SCI) when special circumstances exist (i.e.,
     individual was falsely accused or holds a special expertise that is essential for mission
     accomplishment). The commander provides the CAF with the SIF (if not already at the
     CAF) and full justification for favorable closure. The CAF will then make the security
     clearance determination or request additional information, if necessary.
     8.2.1.9. Endorses requests by Chief of Servicing Security Activity (SF), SSO, and
     Program Security Officer (PSO) for evaluations and relevant documentation from on base
     activities when issues warrant such coordination.
  8.2.2. Chief of Servicing Security Activity, SSO, and PSO:
     8.2.2.1. Provides guidance to commanders on SIF establishment. SF is OPR for Top
     Secret and Secret security clearance SIFs; SSO is OPR for SCI access SIFs.
48                        AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


     8.2.2.2. Establishes, processes, maintains, monitors SIFs for commanders. See
     Attachment 15 for sample memorandum for notification to the commander of SIF
     establishment. See Attachment 16 for sample SIF custodian checklist.
     8.2.2.3. Provides initial notification to the CAF upon SIF establishment via message or
     CAVS within 10 days. Provide full name, SSAN, security clearance data, date SIF
     established, reason, and if access to classified information and SCI has been suspended or
     withdrawn. If the individual has or is being processed for SCI access, forward the
     notification to the CAF through the MAJCOM or activity SSO. Notify the CAF via
     memorandum when the individual will be permitted to continue access to classified
     information and SCI access. See Attachment 17 for sample memorandum. Notify the
     CAF via memorandum when the individual’s access is withdrawn. Process SIFs
     concerning SCI access according to AFMAN 14-304. If SCI access is involved, the SSO
     is responsible for managing the SIF in its entirety to include actions required for the
     security clearance. SF, SSO, and PSO exchange notification information and coordinate
     actions with each other. Additionally, notify the CAF when:
        8.2.2.3.1. Unfavorable information results in a discharge, retirement, or separation.
        Forward a copy of the discharge or separation orders or a copy of the SF 50B3PT,
        Notification of Personnel Action, plus any additional unfavorable information used in
        these actions. If discharge is involved and the individual is or has been indoctrinated
        for SCI in the past three years, see AFMAN 14-304 for discharge for cause
        procedures.
        8.2.2.3.2. An adverse discharge is overturned and the individual returns to active
        duty.
     8.2.2.4. Notifies the Installation Commander when SIFs are established. See Attachment
     18 for sample memorandum.
        8.2.2.4.1. (Added) (MILDENHALL) The ISPM receives SIF establishment
        notifications on behalf of the Installation Commander. The ISPM will inform the
        Installation Commander on SIFs of command interest.
     8.2.2.5. Requests evaluations and relevant documentation from the following activities
     when the issue involved indicates coordination is appropriate (see Attachment 19):
        8.2.2.5.1. Director of Personnel. For any Unfavorable Information Files (UIF),
        performance report summaries, suitability determinations, and personnel actions.
        8.2.2.5.2. Security Forces. For any criminal activities or other pertinent data
        regarding the subject’s police record, involvement in previous compromises or
        security incidents.

investigation leads in overseas areas for DSS. All Air Force commanders must report to AFOSI
any alleged criminal activity falling under the security standards criteria. A table of offenses by
case category that AFOSI investigates is available in AFI 71- 101, Volume I, Criminal
Investigations.
  8.3.1. (Added-USAFE) OPM conducts personnel security investigations overseas leads.
8.4. Final Unfavorable Administrative Actions.
  8.4.1. The CAF is the designated authority to make personnel security determinations that
  can result in an unfavorable administrative action. Commanders take actions for removal due
  to unsuitability IAW 5 CFR 731.201-202, Suitability for Government Employment, at the
  same time as actions are being taken for denial or revocation of a person’s security clearance.
  The unfavorable administrative action on civilian personnel may not include any reference to
  security clearance issues until the results of the final security adjudication are available.
8.5. Procedures.
  8.5.1. General. The CAF will make a final personnel security determination resulting in an
  unfavorable clearance action on an Air Force member, civilian employee, contractor (for
  SCI), or any other Air Force affiliated person when the individual concerned has been
  afforded due process procedures according to this AFI and DOD 5200.2-R. These same due
  process procedures are also applicable for suspension, denial, or revocation of access to SCI.
  There is no distinction between a security clearance and SCI access in the adjudication
  process. If a clearance is revoked or denied, SCI access is also revoked or denied. The CAF
  will notify individuals concerning unfavorable administrative actions using the instructions in
  this AFI and DOD 5200.2-R. Although SAP access is also revoked or denied when a
  clearance is revoked or denied, administrative recourse (appeal) procedures are separate and
  distinct. See AFI 16-702, The Appeal Board (for Special Access Programs).
52                            AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


     8.5.2. The Air Force is not authorized to make any adverse security clearance determination
     on a civilian employee occupying a nonsensitive position. Since such positions do not
     involve sensitive duties or access to classified information, the provisions of the personnel
     security program regarding security clearance eligibility do not apply.
     8.5.3. Confinement. When it is determined that an applicant for a security clearance, or a
     person holding a clearance, has been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for
     more than one year, the clearance of such person shall be denied or revoked with the
     following actions taken by the CAF:
        8.5.3.1. Verification that the individual is presently imprisoned, serving a term of more
        than 12 months.
        8.5.3.2. A Notice of Revocation or Denial of Security Clearance Eligibility forwarded
        through the Servicing Security Activity and SSO (for SCI) to the individual and the
        commander. The Notice is final and no rebuttal privileges or appeal rights are applicable.
        8.5.3.3. The revocation or denial action is entered in DCII and AMS.
8.6. Unfavorable Administrative Action Procedures.
     8.6.1. Denial Authority. The CAF provides individuals with written statements of reasons
     and other required documentation stating intent to deny or revoke their security clearances
     and SCI access using sample format in DOD 5200.2-R, App L and Atch 11.
     8.6.2. Instructions. Individuals may appeal unfavorable administrative actions according to
     the instructions in this AFI, DOD 5200.2-R, Chapter 8, and Appendix L and M. Individuals
     send communications to the CAF and the local supporting Staff Judge Advocate (SJA)
     through their commanders.
        8.6.2.1. (Added) (MILDENHALL) Submit appeals through 100 AW/IP to AFCAF.
     8.6.3. Designated Point of Contact (POC). Unit commanders will designate a POC to serve
     as a liaison between the CAF and individuals under their jurisdiction when unfavorable
     administrative actions are being taken. POCs conduct the associated duties as outlined in
     DOD 5200.2-R, Appendix L-2. The CAF will send communications to the individual through
     the commander, SF, and SSO (for SCI). The supporting SJA will provide the Defense Office
     of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge (AJ) appropriate legal support, upon
     request.
     8.6.4. Individual’s Response to the CAF. Individuals must advise the CAF in writing of their
     intent to respond to the statements of reasons. This must be done within ten days of receipt of
     the statement of reasons. Individuals state whether they intend to submit statements or
     documents to refute, correct, or mitigate the intended actions. Within 60 days from the date
     of receipt of statements of reasons, individuals must provide the CAF with their written
     rebuttals.
        8.6.4.1. (Added) Submit response through 100 AW/IP to AFCAF.
     8.6.5. Extensions. Extensions may only be granted by the CAF. A written request for an
     extension for up to 30 days can be submitted to the CAF through the POC and installation or
     unit commander.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                              53


     8.6.5.1. (Added) (MILDENHALL) Extensions. Extensions may only be granted by the
     CAF. A written request for an extension for up to 30 days can be submitted to the CAF
     through the POC and installation or unit commander. Any extension request must be
     made early enough to allow for a CAF response prior to the original response date.

     8.6.5.1.1. (Added) (MILDENHALL) Submit written request through 100 AW/IP to
     AFCAF.
  8.6.6. CAF Review of Individual’s Response to the Statement of Reasons. Upon receipt of
  the rebuttal, the CAF will determine whether a security clearance should be reinstated,
  revoked, or denied and a final response will be provided to the individual. This must be done
  within 60 days from the date of receipt of the individual’s response. If a final response cannot
  be completed within 60 days, the individual must be notified in writing of this fact, the
  reasons, and the date a final response is expected. AMS will be updated to reflect the CAF
  decision.
  8.6.7. CAF Decision to Deny or Revoke. If the CAF decision is to deny or revoke a person’s
  security clearance the reasons for the final action will be included in a Letter of
  Denial/Revocation to the individual. Individuals will be afforded an opportunity to appeal to
  a letter of denial/revocation through the Personnel Security Appeal Board (PSAB) by one of
  two methods as outlined in this section and DOD 5200.2-R: (1) appeal without a personal
  appearance; or (2) appeal with a personal appearance before an Administrative Judge (AJ)
  from DOHA. Individuals must elect either (1) or (2); individuals may not do both. The CAF
  will process appeal cases as outlined in DOD 5200.2-R, Appendix L and Atch 11.
     8.6.7.1. Appeal Without a Personal Appearance. Individuals directly notify the PSAB of
     their intent to appeal without a personal appearance within 10 days of receipt of the letter
     of denial/ revocation. Address requests to: President, Personnel Security Appeal Board,
     NAIC/IAN, 5113 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041-3230. Individuals send their
     appeals to the President of the PSAB within 40 days of receipt of the letter of
     denial/revocation.
     8.6.7.2. Appeal With a Personal Appearance. Individuals include the name and telephone
     number of the supporting SJA when requesting a personal appearance from DOHA (see
     Attachment 13). The POC will provide this information to the individual. DOHA initially
     contacts the SJA for support with the appeal proceedings. Individuals advise DOHA in
     writing of their desire for a personal appearance within 10 days of receipt of the letters of
     denial/revocation. Copies of these advisement’s are provided to the following: the POC,
     the supporting SJA, and the CAF. The SJA will coordinate with the DOHA AJ to assist in
     providing legal support, upon request and will advise on legal matters to the commander
     and the POC. The CAF will provide the individual’s case file to DOHA within 10 days
     upon DOHA’s request. A DOHA AJ will hear the individual’s case and forward the file,
     transcripts, any documentation obtained from the individual, and a recommendation to
     sustain or overturn the letter of denial/revocation to the PSAB. The deadline for this is 30
     days after the personal appearance. The AJ provides the CAF with a copy of the
     recommendation.
         8.6.7.2.1. Within CONUS personal appearances will be conducted at the individual’s
         duty station or at a nearby location for duty stations within the lower 48 states. For
54                           AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


            personnel assigned OCONUS, the appearances will be conducted at: (1) the
            individual’s duty station or a nearby suitable location; or (2) at DOHA facilities
            located in the metropolitan area of Washington, DC, or Los Angeles, California. The
            Director, DOHA or designee determines the appearance location. Travel and TDY
            costs for the individual will be the responsibility of the employing organization.
        8.6.7.3. (Added) (MILDENHALL) Appeals should be submitted through 100 AW/IP.
     8.6.8. Personnel Security Appeal Board (PSAB). The PSAB will review the individuals
     appeal package, along with DOHA recommendation (if applicable) and notify the individual
     through the CAF of the board’s final decision. See Attachment 5 for additional guidance on
     the PSAB.
 8.7. Security Clearance Reinstatement. An individual’s commander may request
 reinstatement of their security clearance 12 months after the effective date of revocation or
 denial or decision of the PSAB, whichever is later. Requests should be sent to the CAF
 with the commander’s recommendation for approval. The commander includes an
 explanation on how the individual’s behavior has improved and the appropriate documentation
 corresponding to the reason(s) for the denial or revocation. The documentation required
 depends on the reason(s) involved, such as, evaluation for mental health issues, evaluation for
 drug or alcohol abuse; or current financial statement(s).

     8.7.1. (Added) (MILDENHALL) Unit commander’s request for reinstatement of an
     assigned individual’s security clearance will be submitted through 100 AW/IP and
     forwarded onto AFCAF for final adjudication.

 8.8. Special Access Programs. Administrative due process for special access programs is
 handled separately. See AFI 16-702, The Appeal Board (for Special Access Programs).
     8.9.1. Unit commanders contemplating disciplinary or administrative action against military
     members or civilian employees that could lead to a discharge or removal must first obtain
     permission to proceed when personnel hold a special access. Do not take action on personnel
     who now hold or have held access within the periods specified below, to Single Integrated
     Operational Plan-Extremely Sensitive Information (SIOP-ESI), SCI, research and
     development (R&D) special access program, AFOSI special access program, or other special
     access program information until the appropriate special access program office approves.
     (Exceptions are for investigative and preliminary administrative procedures until the
     proposed action has been reviewed and approved by the functional activities having overall
     ownership for the affected information.) Commanders send a written request to the
     appropriate special access program functional office for permission to proceed with further
     processing as outlined below. Apply security classification according to message contents.
     The request must include:
        8.9.1.1. The individual’s name, SSAN, age, marital status, duty assignment, unit
        assignment, date of separation and length of service of the member.
        8.9.1.2. The name of the official who authorized SCI or other special access. Include
        inclusive dates that the person was given access and the units involved.

     8.9.1.3. The specific reason for the proposed ―for cause‖ action. Include the maximum
     sentence and type of separation, or discharge, or dismissal allowable.
     8.9.1.4. The type of separation, discharge, or dismissal contemplated in administrative
     cases, and the commander’s recommended type of discharge certificate to be issued.
     8.9.1.5. The type of court-martial, to include a description of offenses, with an outline of
     proposed charges and specifications; data as to any restraint; and any unusual
     circumstances which may affect the trial.
     8.9.1.6. Comparable data for civilian employees.
     8.9.1.7. Any other information bearing on the proposed action.
  8.9.2. For SCI access contact the servicing MAJCOM or FOA Senior Intelligence Officer
  (SIO) for persons having current SCI access, and persons debriefed within the past three
  years, where damage assessment is considered minimal. Contact the servicing Special
  Security Office (SSO) to determine if the individual had SCI access. Commanders will
  continue to forward ―Authority to Proceed‖ requests, where disclosure could result in serious
  damage, to SSO HQ USAF/INSD for AF Director of Intelligence, Surveillance and
  Reconnaissance (HQ USAF/XOI) approval. Send the request as a Defense Special Security
  Communications System (DSSCS) message through the SSO to the MAJCOM or FOA SIO
  and to SSO HQ USAF/INSD. See AFMAN 14-304 for detailed instructions on how to
  prepare the DSSCS message.
  8.9.3. For SIOP-ESI access. Refer to AFI 10-1102, Safeguarding the Single Integrated
  Operational Plan (SIOP).
     8.9.3.1. (Added-USAFE) SIOP is now known as Nuclear Command and Control
     Extremely Sensitive Information (NC2-ESI).
  8.9.4. For R&D access contact SAF/AQL for persons having current access to R&D special
  access programs and persons debriefed within the past year.
  8.9.5. For persons who have had a duty assignment with AFOSI and have held an AFOSI
  special access contact HQ AFOSI/IVO. The personnel records will reflect AFOSI
  employment or assignment. Commanders contact the local AFOSI detachment commander
  or HQ AFOSI/IVO to determine if the person held an AFOSI special access.
  8.9.6. For multiple accesses, commanders must obtain separate authorizations from each
  appropriate action agency listed above prior to proceeding.
  8.9.7. Processing goals at all command levels must comply with the speedy trial requirement
  and the potentially more restrictive time requirements in civilian removal actions. Normally,
  the processing time period should be concluded within 15 days; measured from the date of
  initiation request, to the date of approval; or denial by the OPR. Voluntary separations of
  airmen, officers, and civilian resignations will not be handled under these procedures unless
  they are in lieu of adverse action. For voluntary separations that are in lieu of adverse action,
  do not allow the separation authority to approve the separation until the appropriate action
  office grants authority to proceed.
  8.9.8. If a commander contemplates a general or special court-martial, processing of the case
  may proceed through preferral of charges and completion of the investigation required by
56                            AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


     Article 32, UCMJ together with collateral actions required under Article 32. Under no
     circumstances may the charges be referred to trial until the appropriate action office grants
     authority to proceed. Actions required by this paragraph do not apply to summary court-
     martials.
     8.9.9. If a commander contemplates discharging an enlisted member, processing of a
     "notification" case or a board hearing entitlement may proceed through giving the member
     notice of the proposed discharge, obtaining the member's response, scheduling necessary
     appointments, and conducting those appointments. Under no circumstances may the
     discharge be "approved" by the separation authority until the appropriate action office grants
     authority to proceed. For board hearing cases, the processing may proceed through initiation
     of the case, obtaining the member’s response, scheduling necessary appointments, and
     conducting those appointments. Under no circumstances may the convening authority order
     the board to be convened to hear the case until the appropriate action office grants authority
     to proceed.
     8.9.10. If a commander or staff agency chief contemplates discharging an officer, the show
     cause authority may not initiate the discharge, issue the show cause memorandum, or
     otherwise require officers to show cause for retention until the appropriate action office
     grants authority to proceed.
     8.9.11. If a supervisor contemplates removal action against a civilian employee who holds
     special access, the supervisor must first coordinate with the servicing CPF. The commander
     of the unit to which the civilian is assigned will then forward a message to the appropriate
     Air Force OPR. Under no circumstances may a "notice of proposed removal" be issued until
     the Air Force OPR grants authority to proceed.
     8.9.12. Periodic reporting by the unit commanders should advise the parent MAJCOM and
     decision authority of any changes to the proposed action every 90 days until the action has
     been completed. If the nature of the case changes significantly (for example, from discharge
     to court martial or from voluntary to involuntary discharge), the unit commander should
     notify the decision authority and seek further instruction. Unit commanders should transmit a
     final report when the adverse action has been completed. In the final report, include date and
     place of discharge. If a SIF has been established on the individual, the commander will notify
     the CAF of the discharge, and request closure of the SIF.
     8.9.13. Decision authorities submit an annual report of completed cases showing the number
     of cases considered, number of approvals and disapprovals, and number pending as of the
     end of the fiscal year to SAF/AAZ, 1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1720.
     For SCI: Quarterly Reporting Requirement (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct): MAJCOM and FOA SIOs will
     submit quarterly reports to 497 IG/ INSD (SSO), 229 Brookley Ave, Bolling AFB DC
     20332-7040. For case management and control purposes include in the reports (1) name,
     grade, SSAN, organization; (2) reason for action (drug abuse, minor disciplinary infraction,
     etc); (3) proposed action (type discharge or court martial); (4) date authority to proceed given
     by SIO; and (5) current disposition (indicate whether case is open or closed). If closed, show
     type and date of discharge.

                                           Attachment 2
                                   REQUEST PROCEDURES


A2.1. General.
     A2.1.1. Security managers:
        A2.1.1.1. Process completed personnel security questionnaires for active duty, reserve
        military, National Guard, civilian and or contractor personnel to the unit’s supporting
        authorized requester of investigations IAW with this AFI. See Attachment 3 for required
        security forms, types of investigations to request and in what situations. An individual
        must have one year retainability for an investigation to be requested.
        A2.1.1.2. Verify the most recent or most significant claimed attendance, degree or
        diploma at an educational institution. This is not required for Periodic Reinvestigations.
        A2.1.1.3. Verify the date and place of birth through a check of appropriate
        documentation, e.g., a birth certificate, certificate of naturalization, passport, or Report of
        Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States of America. This is not required for
        Periodic Reinvestigations.
        A2.1.1.4. Show the verification of birth and highest level of education on the SF
        86/EPSQ software.
     A2.1.2. The subject will provide the required documentation to the security manager.
     A2.1.3. Air Force Reserves and IMAs. The Air Force Reserve Recruiting Service
     (AFRS/RS) processes reservist’s initial personnel security investigation during accession to
     the supporting authorized requester.

     A2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Validating PSI Requirements. USMs will validate the ―need or
     requirement‖ for a PSI before submitting it to the SF authorized requester to avoid submitting
     unnecessary PSIs. Normally, the ―need or requirement‖ for a PSI will be based on the
     Investigation Code (IC) assigned to the position; however, it may also be based on the
     Officer and Enlisted Personnel Processing Codes (PPC) for Permanent Change of Station
     (PCS), PRP positions, mandated Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) listings, and other special
     access programs.

     A2.1.5. (Added-USAFE) PSIs for USAFE Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA).
     USMs are responsible for managing the PSI process and requirements of USAFE IMAs
     assigned to their unit and Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) centrally managed IMAs
     attached to their unit for duty performance. USMs will ensure PSIs are submitted when
     required as outlined in AFI 31-501, regardless of whether the individual is "in status" or
     "performing duty" since maintaining a current security clearance and PSI is a "condition of
     employment". In accordance with HQ USAFE Reserve Program Manager (HQ
     USAFE/CCV) policy guidance, "The units can task the member to provide any information
     on keeping their security clearances up to date. Bottom line, the clearance is a condition of
     their job and their career. If the individual returns to their home station before the
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                              73


  investigation is closed and adjudicated, the Authorized Requestor will forward the suspense
  copy of the PSI to the individual’s home station.

  A2.1.6. (Added-USAFE) Resubmission of Cancelled or Rejected PSIs. USMs will ensure
  PSIs that are cancelled and or rejected by the investigative agency are resubmitted within 30
  days.

  A2.1.7. (Added-USAFE) Monitoring Submitted PSIs. USMs are responsible for monitoring
  the status of submitted PSIs; specifically, USMs will utilize JPAS to verify submitted PSIs
  are ―opened‖ 30 days following the submission by the SF authorized requester. If JPAS does
  not reflect the submitted PSI as ―open‖ after 30 days following submission, USMs will
  contact the SF authorized requester to assist in determining the status of the PSI. USMs will
  not submit Requests to Research, Recertify, or Upgrade Eligibility Requests in JPAS to
  inquire on the status of a submitted or open investigation.

A2.2. Authorized Requesters.
  A2.2.1. Authorized Requestors for Accessions.
     A2.2.1.1. HQ AFRS submits initial investigations (NACLC) for enlisted recruits through
     the Air Force Recruiting Information Support System (AFRISS).
         A2.2.1.1.1. 319 TRS/DPAS:
             A2.2.1.1.1.1. Verifies that the NACLC, submitted by AFRS, is open by checking
             JPAS and the OPM help desk, if necessary. When an open NACLC cannot be
             confirmed through either source, the 319 TRS/DPAS:
                 A2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Submits a new NACLC and file a copy of the submitted
                 investigation in the member’s Unit Personnel Record Group (UPRG).
             A2.2.1.1.1.2. Submits SSBI investigation requests to OPM for all personnel
             training into a sensitive skill. A copy of the investigation request and receipt will
             be filed in the member's UPRG. On arrival at the student's technical training
             location, security managers will remove the investigation package and forward to
             the servicing security activity.
             A2.2.1.1.1.3. Processes priority SSBI investigations for authorized AFSCs. HQ
             AETC/ SFI, in conjunction with AF/XOS-FI, is the approval authority for priority
             investigations for accessions.
     A2.2.1.2. Officer accession sources submit initial investigations (NACLC) to OPM for
     recruits, normally within 30 days of their contract obligation to the Air Force.
     A2.2.1.3. Officer accession sources submit SSBI investigation requests to OPM for
     personnel training into a sensitive skill.
     A2.2.1.4. Losing authorized requesters and AFRS submit SSBI requests for prior service
     and non-prior service OTS selects prior to their departure.
  A2.2.2. Authorized Requesters for Non-Accessions:
74                       AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


     A2.2.2.1. Request personnel security investigations according to position coding
     requirements (see para 7.2. and Attachment 22). See Attachment 3, for required security
     forms, types of investigations to request. Submit investigation requests to OPM.
     A2.2.2.2. Use the EPSQ software as the primary source for the investigative request.
     Validate the EPSQ, and print a hard copy for mailing investigation requests to OPM.
     OPM does not have electronic transmission capability.
        A2.2.2.2.1. For additional EPSQ guidance consult the DSS web site:
        http://www.dss.mil. Contact DSS Customer Service Center at 1-800-542-0237 or
        DSN 283-7731, if necessary.
            A2.2.2.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Within USAFE, e-QIP is the primary source for
            investigation requests. These are submitted electronically to OPM. If system
            limitations preclude submission via e-QIP, a hard copy of the EPSQ, Standard
            Form 85, SF 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions or SF 86, as
            appropriate may be printed and mailed to OPM.

NOTES:
1. A NACLC is a prerequisite for military members upon entry. DOD civilians receive a NACIC
as a prerequisite for federal employment. These investigations exceed the required investigations
and can be used for unescorted entry.

2. Air Reserve forces personnel with a current ENTNAC or NAC on file may have unescorted
entry to restricted areas while in civilian status, pending completion of the required NACIC.

3. Prior ENTNAC/NAC/NACI/NACIC investigations meet the requirements for prior military
members who have been separated. Commanders may waive on a case by case basis, the
82                             AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


investigative requirements for unescorted entry to restricted areas containing Protection Level
(PL) 2 and or 3 resources pending completion of a favorable NACLC, NAC, or NACIC after
favorable review of the completed personnel security questionnaire for the investigation.

4. Installation records checks on employees in child care services include a check of the state
criminal history repository. The state criminal history repository checks are for suitability
affecting the consolidated civilian personnel office and morale, welfare, and recreation programs.
The sponsoring activity sends out and receives the state criminal history repository.

5. The NAC must consist of: (a) host-government law enforcement and security agency records
check at the city, state, province, and national level, (b) DCII check, and (c) FBI check where
information exists indicating residence by the foreign national in the United States for one year
or more since the age 18.

NOTES:
1. Send a request letter through channels to the approving authority when non-US nationals or
immigrant alien personnel require limited access to Secret or Confidential defense information or
unescorted entry to PL 1, 2, or 3 restricted areas.
2. Complete items 10 through 14 when an investigation or a security clearance is required. The
LFC is not required when recording special access program authorizations, unless specified in
the governing directive. This guidance also applies to sections IV and V.
3. If the individual records derogatory information in Section VII, promptly notify the requester
and security information file custodians. This action determines if re-adjudication of the person’s
security clearance is necessary by the CAF. This guidance also applies to Section V.
4. Ensure the request process includes a review of SK for evidence of an UIF concerning the
member. Also, review personnel records to determine if derogatory information exists from a
personnel security standpoint. Check personnel records to confirm other data, such as
employment or military service as listed on SF Form 86, when necessary. Persons designated to
sign Item 14 of the form must take or confirm these actions. Enter results of these reviews in
Section VII.
5. Note that this authority may be delegated to other medical staff personnel who may review
medical records and form professional opinions based on the information being evaluated. If no
medical records are on file (as for many civil service employees) annotate the form to that effect.
The DD Form 1879 then shows no local medical records were checked and DSS agents check
the records.
6. Review the records of the security clearance function and reports and analysis section. If a SIF
exists, deny the requested personnel security action pending completion of adjudication actions.
In these cases, also enter in Section VII that a SIF exists. Also, review the remarks section for
any other derogatory information reported and evaluate the need to establish a SIF for further
adjudication. Enter results of this evaluation in Section VII.
7. Annotate Section VII to reflect what document was used to verify citizenship status.

                                    SMITH AMENDMENT

 A24.1. Implementation of the Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National
 Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United
 States Code, to add a new section that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a
 security clearance by the DoD under four specific circumstances as outlined below.
   A24.1.1. Provision (1) disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and Federal courts,
   including UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of more than one year, regardless of the
   amount of time actually served.
   A24.1.2. Provision (2) does not change the substance of the existing adjudication guideline
   relative to current drug involvement. Anyone who is currently an unlawful user of, or
   addicted to, a controlled substance.
   A24.1.3. Provision (3) does not change the substance of the adjudication guidelines for
   emotional, mental, or personality disorders. Anyone who is found to be mentally incompetent
   (incapable of safeguarding classified information) by a credentialed mental health
   professional approved by DoD.
   A24.1.4. Provision (4) disqualifies persons who have been discharged or dismissed from the
   Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.
A24.2. Secretary of the Air Force may authorize a waiver in meritorious cases under provisions
(1) & (4). Waiver authority is not delegable.

A24.3. Provision (2) & (3) disqualifies a person for eligibility for a security clearance and may
not be waived.

A24.4. Individuals that fall under the categories (1) through (4) will be afforded applicable due
process and appeal opportunity IAW the DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program and this
instruction.

A24.5. When AFCAF issues a final statement of reasons to deny or revoke a security clearance
in cases where a waiver is allowed (provisions 1 and 4) the subject will be informed of the
waiver provision, provided a copy of the statute and other information on how to respond. The
subject must include in the response to the statement of reasons if they want to be considered for
a waiver, if applicable.

A24.6. Decision process for determining whether a particular case warrents a meritorious waiver:

   A24.6.1. The AFCAF is the first level nominating office and determines if the case warrants
   a meritorious waiver under the provisions of the statute. If approved, the case is forwarded
   with the proposed request for waiver and full justification to the Air Force Personnel Security
   Appeal Board (PSAB) for review.
   A24.6.2. If the PSAB determines the case has meritorious justification, the case summary is
   returned to the AFCAF for forwarding to SAF/AA.
120                          AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


       A24.6.2.1. SAF/AA may disapprove the waiver request or forward it to the SECAF with
       recommendation for approval. Both the SAF/AA and SECAF decisions are final.
A24.7. AFCAF will provide quarterly summaries to SAF/AA by the10th of each month following
the end of each calendar quarter of all waivers submitted to SECAF. SAF/AA provides report to
USD/I by the 15th .
A24.8. The statute policy applies to:
   A24.8.1. All initial determinations to grant security clearance eligibility or access and
   determinations to continue clearance eligibility/accesses following a reinvestigation;
   A24.8.2. Existing clearances eligibility or access which a previous or other investigation
   reveals a previous favorably resolved issue involving one or more of the four statutory
   provisions, regardless of the presence or absence of subsequent disqualifying issues;
   A24.8.3. Previous and follow-on periodic reinvestigations and other investigations initiated
   for other reasons; such as:
       A24.8.3.1. Security Information File, Special Investigation Inquiry, etc., and all pending
       cases in which a final decision had not been issued as of 7 Jun 01.
A24.9. The statue polices do not apply to:
   A24.9.1. Conversions/transfers/reinstatements of current DoD security clearances, including
   transfers of clearances of employees within the DoD, clearances of employees who fall under
   the National Industrial Security Program, and transfers of clearances to the DoD of
   employees coming from other Federal agencies.

124                           AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


      type of personnel security investigation is listed in DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix B. See
      Attachment 2 for procedures on requesting personnel security investigations (PSI).
      See Attachment 3 for guidance on the types of required personnel security
      investigations and appropriate questionnaire forms and or Electronic Personnel
      Security Questionnaire (EPSQ) Software.
 2.4.1. General. The investigations listed in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R and this
 instruction are the only PSIs authorized. The Secretary of the Air Force and/or the
 Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence must approve raising or lowering the scope
 of the authorized investigation.

 2.5 Authorized Personnel Security Investigation Provider. The Office of Personnel
 Management
 (OPM) is the DoD Authorized Personnel Security Investigation Provider.
 2.7. Overseas Personnel Security Investigations. AFOSI personnel conduct the
 overseas portion of personnel security investigations, augmented by Army, Navy, and
 State Department counterparts.
 3.11. Interim Security Clearances. Commanders may grant interim security
 clearances for access to Top Secret and Secret information when the requirements of
 DoD 5200.2-R, paragraph 3.401 have been met. Use of local information and the
 following requirements provide Commanders with the necessary tools to exercise their
 authority to grant interim security clearances. Also see Attachment 25, Table A25.1
 for guidance on the authority level to grant interim security clearance/access to
 specific programs.
 3.11.1. Interim Top Secret security clearances:
 3.11.1.1 Favorable ENTNAC, NAC, NACI, NACIC, NACLC, or ANACI completed.
 3.11.1.2. Consult the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) to determine the
 existence of a favorable ENTNAC, NAC, NACI, NACIC, NACLC, or ANACI. The
 investigation is acceptable if there is no break in service over two years.
 3.11.1.3. Favorable review of personnel security questionnaire.
 3.11.1.4. Favorable review of local personnel records, base and or security force
 records, medical records, and other security records, as appropriate.
 3.11.1.5. SSBI package has been submitted by an Authorized Requester to the
 investigative agency provider.
 3.11.2. Commanders can grant interim Top Secret security clearance if the above
 provisions have been met.
 3.11.3. If there is no record of a completed investigation (NAC portion) in JPAS,
 contact Air Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF) Customer Support through
 JPAS to determine if there is a favorable NAC. (Note Optional: Authorized requesters
 can request ―Advanced NAC Results‖ from OPM on the OPM Agency Use Sheet.)
 3.11.4. Interim Secret security clearances:
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                          125


3.11.4.1. Favorable review of personnel security questionnaire.
3.11.4.2. Favorable review of local personnel records, base and or security forces
records, medical records, and other security records, as appropriate.

3.11.4.3. NACLC or ANACI has been submitted by an Authorized Requester to an
investigative agency provider.
3.11.5. Interim security clearances must be documented in JPAS or in writing if JPAS
is unavailable, until the final security clearance eligibility is granted by the AFCAF.
3.11.6. For Civilians:
3.11.6.1. Consult JPAS on a newly hired civilian for a previous security
clearance/personnel security investigation to determine if a previous security clearance
was held as a former military member (without a break in service of two years) or if a
security clearance as either an Air Reserve Technician or as a traditional reservist was
held.
3.11.6.2. Pending completion of ANACIs or SSBIs, as appropriate, civilians may
occupy non-critical sensitive or critical sensitive positions. Commanders prepare a
waiver of pre-employment investigation requirements when such action is necessary
and in the national interest. Interim security clearance may not be granted until after
the commander signs the waiver memorandum.
3.11.7. JPAS is the source for determining investigative status on pending
investigations. Also see para 7.9.


3.28. Periodic Reinvestigations (PR). PRs are required every 5 years for Top Secret
and 10 years for Secret. Authorized requesters submit requests for reinvestigations to
the DoD Authorized Investigation Provider as outlined in A2.2.2.1. See AFI 31-406,
Applying North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Protection Standards, for
submission of PRs for NATO investigations.


3.29. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). Although such personnel normally only
require a Secret clearance, an SSBI is initially required due to training and
assignments involving nuclear weapons. Persons occupying an EOD position shall
undergo a Secret PR on a five year recurring basis.


5.2. Authorized Requesters.
5.2.1. MAJCOM, field operating agency (FOA), or direct reporting unit (DRU) staffs
designate authorized requesters to initiate PSIs for their organization. As a general
rule, the number of authorized requesters will be kept to the minimum number
required to meet mission requirements. See Attachment 2 for request procedures.
5.2.2. Authorized requesters provide the AFCAF with the name, telephone number,
and office symbol of individual(s) who may obtain security clearance and or
126                         AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


 investigative data on individuals within their organization and provide copy to
 respective MAJCOM. See para 6.1 for AFCAF address.
 5.2.3. Authorized requesters may query the JCAVS or call the CAF Customer Support
 Section at DSN 754-1242/43 to determine investigative and/or adjudicative status.
 5.2.4. Authorized requesters approve and submit personnel security questionnaires to
 the DoD Authorized Personnel Investigation Provider according to Attachment 2.

 5.5. Priority Requests. The following sensitive programs are authorized priority
 processing service by OPM:
 5.5.1. PRP. In cases where a PRP ―C‖ coded case warrants ―Priority‖ service by OPM,
 the authorized requester must coordinate the request through channels to AF/XOS-FI.
 Each authorized requester will maintain a fiscal year (FY) Excel spreadsheet listing for
 this purpose. The spreadsheet will include all previously coordinated FY priority PSIs
 and all new requirements the authorized requester is coordinating under this authority.
 When coordinating new priority cases, forward the entire FY spreadsheet to afx-
 ofi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. AF/XOS-FI will return to the authorized requester
 for monitoring the completion of the investigation.
 5.5.2. SCI. When the NACLC adjudication date is less than 12 months (DCID 6/4,
 Annex A, para 5), the servicing Authorized Requester will provide the servicing SSO
 a copy of the completed SF 86 for each SSBI request with an SCI access requirement.
 This will be done at the same time the request for SSBI/SCI is forwarded to OPM.
 Security Managers/SSOs/Authorized Requesters will expedite the processing of the
 SSBI off the installation to OPM and request priority level of service. On the OPM
 Agency Use Sheet annotate 30A in Block A. Also see AFMAN 14-304.
 5.7. Dual Citizenship. A security concern could exist when a military member, DoD
 civilian, contractor, or consultant is submitted for a personnel security investigation
 and they are a dual citizen and/or possess/ use a foreign passport.
 5.7.1. Dual Citizenship. Dual citizenship in and of itself is not an automatic
 disqualifier for security clearance eligibility. However, possession of dual citizenship
 and particularly the exercise of dual citizenship is a condition that raises a security
 concern and may be a disqualifying factor in a security clearance eligibility
 determination. There are factors that could mitigate the maintenance of dual
 citizenship, as outlined in DoD 5200.2-R, App I, Foreign Preference. An individual’s
 expressed willingness to renounce dual citizenship is one of the conditions that could
 mitigate security concerns.
 5.7.2. Possession or Use of a Foreign Passport. Possession and/or use of a foreign
 passport in preference to a US passport raises doubt as to whether the person’s
 allegiance to the US is paramount and could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable
 by the US. The security clearance will be denied or revoked, unless the applicant
 surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from SAF/AA.
 Requests for approval are forwarded through respective Information Security Program
 Manager (ISPM) channels to HQ USAF/XOS-FI for processing to SAF/AA.
 Justification must include what benefit the AF will gain from a person holding a
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                           127


foreign passport. AFCAF will annotate approvals in the remarks field of the JPAS.
5.7.3. Surrendering the Passport. Individuals who indicate they possess a foreign
passport in item 15 of the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire or item 17d on
the Standard Form 86, ―Questionnaire for National Security Positions,‖ will be
required to surrender the passport via one of the following methods:
5.7.3.1. Return the passport to the appropriate country embassy or consulate via
certified receipt mail. A copy of the transmittal memo forwarding the passport and the
return receipt will be forwarded to the AFCAF. See para 6.1 for AFCAF address. If
the name of adjudicator assigned to the case is known, include this in the ATTN line
of the address.

5.7.3.2. Destroy the passport as witnessed by an AF security manager. Cut up the
passport and place in a burn bag. The witnessing security manager will document the
destruction of the passport in an explanatory memorandum, which will be forwarded
to the AFCAF and a copy provided to the subject.
5.7.4. Security Clearance Eligibility. In order for individuals who hold foreign
passport and dual citizenship to be considered for and/or be granted security clearance
eligibility the following must be completed:
5.7.4.1. Provide a written statement expressing their willingness to renounce foreign
citizenship claims in favor of a sole United States citizenship status. Actual
renouncement is not required.
5.7.4.2. Return and or destroy the passport.
5.7.5. The renouncement statement and documentation of destruction of the passport
must be provided to the AFCAF. The AFCAF reviews each case on its own merits to
determine security clearance eligibility.
5.7.6. This same guidance will apply if the passport is identified after a security
clearance determination is made.


6.1. Central Adjudication Authority. The Air Force Central Adjudication Facility
(AFCAF) is the Central Adjudication Authority. Address is: AFCAF/PSA, 229
Brookely Ave, Bolling AFB 20032.
6.1.1. The policy and criteria set forth in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, paragraph 2-200,
6-102 and Appendix I will be applied in making personnel security determinations for
a security clearance or assignment to sensitive duties.
6.1.2. Unfavorable adjudication results in the denial/revocation of clearance eligibility
(see Chapter 8).
6.1.3. The AFCAF will review all investigative products and make an eligibility
determination.
6.1.4. AFCAF Customer Service will not release adverse information to inquiring
customers on pending investigations, as it invokes privacy act concerns. Derogatory
128                          AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


issues are often resolved through completion of the investigation and or adjudication
of the case. Premature dissemination of unresolved and or un-adjudicated issues could
result in discriminatory practices with respect to such areas as employments or
assignments.
6.2. Adjudicative Record. Personnel security determinations are reflected in the
JPAS. JPAS replaced Sentinel Key (SK) as used throughout AFI 31-501.

7.1. General.
7.1.1. The AFCAF is the designated authority to grant, suspend, deny, or revoke
personnel security clearances and SCI accesses (see Chapter 11).
7.2. Investigative Requirements for Coding Positions. Commanders will:
7.2.1. Determine the type of investigation required for mission purposes for each
military and civilian position in the organization. Investigations are required for
multiple purposes: to determine suitability and/or trustworthiness of individual for
employment/assignment to positions of trust/access to certain programs; and for
security clearance. Each position is coded with the appropriate position code reflecting
the required investigation level in the unit manning document (UMD) and the Defense
Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). These will also be reflected in the
Headquarters Air Force Manpower Data System (HAF-MDS).
 7.2.1.1. Assign one of the five investigation types to each position:
 7.2.1. l.1. Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).
 7.2.2.1.2. National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit (NACLC).
 7.2.2.1.3. Access National Agency Check and Inquiries (ANACI).
 7.2.2.1.4. National Agency Check Plus Inquiries (NACI).
 7.2.2.1.5. National Agency Check (NAC).
 7.2.1.2. The definitions and corresponding codes are located in Attachment 22, Table
 A22.1.
 7.2.1.3. Conduct annual review to determine the accuracy of position coding. The last
 AF-wide directed review was conducted in May 04. Reviews will be conducted each
 May. Retain results for review during self inspections, etc.
 7.2.1.4. Ensure only necessary investigations are requested to meet mission essential
 needs.
 7.2.1.5. See Attachment 22 for additional guidance.
 7.3. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs). HQ
 USAF/XOS-FI approves requests for adding security clearances or investigations as
 AFSC prerequisites. Requests are staffed through ISPM channels. AFMAN 36-2105,
 Officer Classification and AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted Classification will reflect an
 SSBI requirement for entry, award, and retention for the respective mandatory
 AFSCs. See Attachment 22; Table A22.2, A22.3.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                           129


 7.4. Investigative Requirements for Sensitive Programs. There are several sensitive
 programs that have been designated as a mandatory SSBI requirement, i.e.,
 Presidential Support, Personnel Reliability Program, etc. See Attachment 22, Table
 A22.4.
 7.5. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Deployments, Operational or
 Contractual Exigencies. This policy does not apply to SCI. Positions identified for
 deployments will, as a minimum, be assigned a NACLC, requiring access to Secret
 information for the in-country threat briefing. SSBIs are not authorized for purposes
 of Top Secret eligibility ―just in case of‖ deployment. In these situations, commanders
 grant interim Top Secret access for a period of up to 180 days. This can be renewed
 for extended deployment purposes and for redeployment. Interim Top Secret access is
 granted for the purpose of deployment based on the existing NACLC, and
 discontinued upon return to home station. SSBIs will not be required for this purpose.
 Persons must be US citizens and have not had a break in service for more than 24
 months. Record of the interim TS is annotated in JPAS or in cases where it is not
 available, documented and maintained with security related documents. However,
 SSBI is authorized if a joint or theater deployment requires a final Top Secret security
 clearance and will not accept interims, i.e., JCS contingencies. These requirements
 need to be identified and positions coded IAW para 7.2 of this instruction.

 7.6. Approval Authorities for Additional/New/Upgrade of SSBIs. 3-Star/Civilian
 Equivalent authority is required to approve any additional/new/upgrade SSBIs before
 the servicing Manpower Office codes the positions on the UMD. Approval authorized
 cannot be delegated. Approval authorities are as follows:
 7.6.1. MAJCOMs: CV or NAF/CC.
 7.6.2. FOAs: parent 2-Ltr or SAF/AA or AF/CVA if the parent 2-Ltr is not at the
 appropriate grade level.
 7.6.3. DRUs: AF/CVA.
 7.6.4. HQ USAF:
 7.6.4.1. Air Staff: AF/CVA.
 7.6.4.2. Secretariate: SAF/AA.
 7.6.5. Commands will establish internal certifying procedures. The approval
 documentation will be retained by the Manpower Office for three years and is subject
 to compliance review by HQ AFIA or their designee. Approval will increase
 MAJCOM funds withhold for personnel security investigations through the FYDP.
7.7. Periodic Reinvestigations. Periodic Reinvestigations will be kept current for
incumbents assigned against positions coded as requiring SSBI and NACLC/ANACI.
Also see para A2.7.
 7.8. Issuing Security Clearance Eligibility. AFCAF issues security clearance
 eligibility and enters the determination into JPAS.
 7.9. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). JPAS is the Department of
130                        AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


 Defense (DoD) personnel security clearance and access database. It facilitates
 personnel security management for the DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF),
 security managers, and offers both non-SCI and SCI functions. It interfaces with the
 investigative providers, the personnel systems within the Department thus eliminating
 manual transactions and expediting the flow of personnel security information to
 warfighters.
 7.9.1 JPAS is the primary source for determining investigative data/status of
 investigations on individuals in the DoD. JPAS allows communication between the
 CAFs and its customers. All information in JPAS is unclassified, but must be
 protected according to the requirements for privacy/sensitive information and For
 Official Use Only (FOUO) in accordance with AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act
 Program and DoDR 5400.7/AF Supplement, DoD Freedom of Information Act
 Program.
 7.9.2. JPAS has two applications: The Joint Adjudication Management System
 (JAMS) and Joint Clearance and Access Verification System (JCAVS).
 7.9.2.1. JAMS is for adjudicative personnel only and provides capabilities such as
 case management/distribution, adjudication decisions, adjudicative history and
 summary, due process, and future ability for each CAF to electronically access
 investigative reports from the investigative providers.
 7.9.2.1.1. JAMS replaced the Adjudicative Management System (AMS), as used
 throughout this instruction.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                          131



7.9.2.2. JCAVS is for non-SCI and SCI security managers/officers and authorized
requesters and provides capabilities such as access indoctrination/debriefing history,
incident/issue file reporting, history and management of unit personnel security
functions.
7.9.2.2.1. JCAVS replaced Clearance and Access Verification System (CAVS), as used
throughout this instruction.
7.9.3. ISPMs determine the number of users and the access levels for each user.
Clearance data elements in the JCAVS include the full date and type of investigation
and the full date and status of security clearance. The information is invalid when any
of these four data elements are incomplete.
7.9.3.1. Use the most current highest level eligibility recorded in the JCAVS when
more than one entry appears for an individual.
7.9.3.2. The term ―DCID 6/4 (formerly DCID 1/14)‖ means the person has been the
subject of a SSBI, has been granted a Top Secret security clearance eligibility, is
eligible for SCI access if required for mission essential purposes and may already
have SCI access. See AFMAN 14-304.
7.9.4. The JCAVS will provide the following information:
7.9.4.1. An individual’s security clearance eligibility level and access level.
7.9.4.2. Visit notification.
7.9.4.3. Suspension notification.
7.9.4.4. SCI indoctrination, nondisclosure statement, and debriefing dates.
7.9.4.5. Establishment of a SIF.
7.9.6. JCAVS User Levels are as follows:
7.9.6.1. Level 2 - SCI security personnel at unified command, DoD agency, military
installation or major command/equivalent headquarters. Personnel Security
Management (PSM) - Net is determined by the responsible SOIC or designee. (Read
and Write Access - SSBI/DCID 6/4 with current SCI Access.)
7.9.6.2. Level 3 - SCI security personnel at echelons subordinate to Level 2 at a
particular geographic location (installation, base, post, naval vessel). PSM - Net is

 installations, buildings, etc. Varies according to organizations. (Read Access -
 SSBI/DCID 6/4 Eligibility.)
 7.9.6.8. Level 10 - Visitor Management. Level 10 users will have the same view of the
 JCAVS Personnel Summary as a JCAVS Level 7 User. They will receive Visit
 Notification when their Security Management Office (SMO) is being notified of a
 visit. A Level 10 User may not be an account manager to create or delete an account at
 any level. NACLC/ANACI/Secret Eligibility.
 7.10. AF JPAS Users Guide. Contains detailed instructions on operating JPAS and
 becoming      a       new        user.     See      the       follow      URL:

 JPAS web site is: https://jpas.osd.mil Requests for changes to JPAS may be made
 on-line at https://jpas.osd.mil.


 7.11. Granting Access. Commanders grant access to classified information when a
 mission essential need exists and only when all of the following prerequisites are met:
 (1) individual has the appropriate security clearance eligibility; (2) individual has
 signed an SF 312 (see AFI 31-401); and (3) individual has a need-to-know. Authorized
 base level users will record access in the JCAVS. See Chapter 3 for other situations
 when access to classified information may be granted.


 7.12. Obtaining Information from the AFCAF.
 7.12.1. Authorized requesters may contact the AFCAF Customer Support Section
 through JPAS. In situations where no security clearance data is available at the unit,
 no information is available in the JCAVS, and the AFCAF has valid security clearance
 information on file, a record of the call will be used as evidence of valid clearance
 data pending update of the JCAVS. The authorized requester prepares a memorandum
 for record (MFR) showing: (1) name, grade, and organization of the individual calling
 the AFCAF; (2) name, grade, organization, and SSN of the subject; (3) name of person
 at the AFCAF providing clearance eligibility data, and (4) type and date of

 Attachment 24
 SMITH AMENDMENT
 A24.1. Implementation of the Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National
 Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United
 States Code, to add a new section that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a
 security clearance by the DoD under four specific circumstances as outlined below.
 A24.1.1. Provision (1) disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and Federal
 courts, including UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of more than one year,
 regardless of the amount of time actually served

 A24.1.2. Provision (2) does not change the substance of the existing adjudication
 guideline relative to current drug involvement. Anyone who is currently an unlawful
 user of, or addicted to, a controlled substance.
 A24.1.3. Provision (3) does not change the substance of the adjudication guidelines for
 emotional, mental, or personality disorders. Anyone who is found to be mentally
 incompetent (incapable of safeguarding classified information) by a credentialed
 mental health professional approved by DoD.
 A24.1.4. Provision (4) disqualifies persons who have been discharged or dismissed
 from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                           147


A24.2. Secretary of the Air Force may authorize a waiver in meritorious cases under
provisions (1) & (4). Waiver authority is not delegable.
A24.3. Provision (2) & (3) disqualifies a person for eligibility for a security clearance
and may not be waived.
A24.4. Individuals that fall under the categories (1) through (4) will be afforded
applicable due process and appeal opportunity IAW the DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel
Security Program and this instruction.
A24.5. When AFCAF issues a final statement of reasons to deny or revoke a security
clearance in cases where a waiver is allowed (provisions 1 and 4) the subject will be
informed of the waiver provision, provided a copy of the statute and other information
on how to respond. The subject must include in the response to the statement of
reasons if they want to be considered for a waiver, if applicable.
A24.6. Decision process for determining whether a particular case warrents a
meritorious waiver:
A24.6.1. The AFCAF is the first level nominating office and determines if the case
warrants a meritorious waiver under the provisions of the statute. If approved, the case
is forwarded with the proposed request for waiver and full justification to the Air
Force Personnel Security Appeal Board (PSAB) for review.
A24.6.2. If the PSAB determines the case has meritorious justification, the case
summary is returned to the AFCAF for forwarding to SAF/AA.
A24.6.2.1. SAF/AA may disapprove the waiver request or forward it to the SECAF
with recommendation for approval. Both the SAF/AA and SECAF decisions are final.
A24.7. AFCAF will provide quarterly summaries to SAF/AA by the10th of each month
following the end of each calendar quarter of all waivers submitted to SECAF.
SAF/AA provides report to USD/I by the 15th.
A24.8. The statute policy applies to:
A24.8.1. All initial determinations to grant security clearance eligibility or access and
determinations to continue clearance eligibility/accesses following a reinvestigation;

                                Attachment 27 (Added-USAFE)
   LOCAL NATIONAL (LN) PERSONNEL SECURITY INVESTIGATION (PSI)
REQUIREMENTS FOR USAFE UNITS EXCEPT THOSE IN THE UK AND GERMANY

A27.1. (Added-USAFE) Overview. Non-US citizens or LNs employed by DOD Components
overseas, whose duties do not require access to classified information, require a National Agency
Check (NAC) equivalent PSI. The NAC equivalent PSI or NACLN will be completed on all LN
appropriated and nonappropriated employees, contractors, sub-contractors, to include AAFES
employees before employment or on-base volunteer work. As a minimum, a NACLN must
consist of:
   A27.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Host government law enforcement and security agency checks
   (HAC) at the city, state (province), and national level.
   A27.1.2. (Added-USAFE) A DCII check.
   A27.1.3. (Added-USAFE) An FBI check where information exists that indicates residence
   by the non-US citizen in the US for twelve or more consecutive months since age 18; and:
   A27.1.4. (Added-USAFE) A Local Files Check (Security Forces Management Information
   System (SFMIS), Medical records, etc., as appropriate).
A27.2. (Added-USAFE) Position Sensitivity. All positions, to include contractor positions,
must be assigned a position sensitivity based on the duties and responsibilities of the position.
Most positions are considered non-sensitive unless their duties and responsibilities dictate
otherwise. For examples of sensitive positions, refer to Attachment 36 (Added).
   A27.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The sponsoring agency or unit (hiring agency) and a designated
   representative from the SFS will jointly determine if a position is sensitive based upon the
   nature, scope and sensitivity of the work being performed. Before the hiring process begins,
   all on-base job descriptions, contracts, or other position descriptions must clearly state that
   the duty position is non-sensitive or sensitive before any hiring or legally binding contract
   begins.
       A27.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If the position cannot be jointly determined as sensitive or
       non-sensitive, the installation commander is the final determining authority. The
       installation commander may delegate this authority no lower than the mission support
       group deputy commander (MSG/ CD).
A27.3. (Added-USAFE) Minimum Investigative Requirements for Employment:
   A27.3.1. (Added-USAFE) LNs may be employed and allowed to perform the non-sensitive
   portion of appropriated and nonappropriated fund sensitive positions, to include certain
   contractors, subcontractors, and employees performing or being considered for contracts,
   only after favorable completion of the DCII and LFC and the HAC and FBI check (when
   applicable) have been initiated and are pending. Additionally, individuals may perform the
   sensitive portion of employment if under constant supervision by an individual whose
   background checks have been completed, with no derogatory reports, once the LFC is
   favorable and the HAC and FBI check (where applicable) have been initiated and are
   pending.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                               151


   A27.3.2. (Added-USAFE) LNs may not be employed in any capacity if a LFC identifies
   derogatory and or unfavorable information, until a suitability determination on the
   information and or the case is favorably completed.
   A27.3.3. (Added-USAFE) All LNs requiring unclassified Local Area Network (LAN) IT
   level 3 access or unescorted entry into Protection Level (PL) 3 restricted areas must have a
   fully completed favorable NACLN before access is granted. Interim access is prohibited.
A27.4. (Added-USAFE) Child-care or Youth Activity Workers. For child-care or youth
activity workers, expand the HAC, whenever permissible by the laws of the host government to
include agencies which maintain data banks on child abusers and molesters, as required in AFI
34-276, Family Child Care Programs and AFMAN 34-310, Nonappropriated Fund Personnel
Program Management and Administration.

A27.5. (Added-USAFE) Third Country Nationals (TCN):

   A27.5.1. (Added-USAFE) TCN Dependents of US Personnel. TCN dependents of US
   personnel employed by DoD Components overseas, whose duties do not require access to
   classified information, must meet the investigative requirements outlined in AFI 31-501,
   paragraph A24.1.1. except that the appropriate US PSI commensurate with the position will
   be completed instead of the host country HAC. Normally, the NAC PSI will be submitted;
   however, the type of PSI may vary depending on the sensitivity of the position. It is the
   responsibility of the OPR to ensure the appropriate US PSI is submitted.

   A27.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Other TCNs. The employment of TCNs other than dependents
   of US personnel is largely dependent on the individual’s permission to be ―in‖ and ―work in‖
   the host nation and the host nation response to the HAC.

       A27.5.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Before employment, employer needs verification that the
       TCN has received permission and or authority to be in and work in the host country.

       A27.5.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Host Nation HAC Responses:

              A27.5.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) If the host nation responds that a HAC cannot be
              or will not be performed because the TCN hasn’t resided in the host country for
              the required period of time, there is insufficient data on file, etc., then that is a
              decision provided by the ―host government‖, the HAC was ―not‖ completed, and
              the individual cannot be employed. LNs or TCNs denied a HAC for residency
              cannot resubmit until sufficient residency is obtained.

              A27.5.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) If the host nation responds that they have
              performed the HAC and there is no information on file because the TCN hasn’t
              resided in the host country for the required period of time, or that they have
              ―performed‖ the HAC and no data is available on the TCN, then that is a decision
              provided by the ―host government‖, the HAC ―was‖ completed, and the
              individual ―could‖ be hired. In this case, an employment suitability decision
              should be made.
152                         AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


       A27.5.2.3. (Added-USAFE) It is not uncommon for the TCN to be ineligible for the
       Host Agency Check because they have not resided in the requesting country for the
       required length of time for the HAC to be conducted. In these situations, the TCN may
       provide their country’s equivalent of the HAC. The equivalent document must:

               A27.5.2.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Be the original copy and translated into English
               and notarized.

               A27.5.2.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Reflect a favorable background investigation
               result. If not, a suitability determination must be completed.

               A27.5.2.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Be dated within 90 days of entry on duty.

       A27.5.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Since other country HACs are limited in scope, additional
       measures and considerations must be taken; specifically:

               A27.5.2.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Closely scrutinizes unescorted installation access
               requirements and limits the number of days and times when access is allowed.

               A27.5.2.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Deny unescorted installation access sign-in
               privileges.

               A27.5.2.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Limit employment or contract performance only
               to non-sensitive duties.

A27.6. (Added-USAFE) Program Management. The local CPF is the program manager or
OPR for LN appropriated and nonappropriated fund employee PSIs; however, this may vary
depending on Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) or other local agreements or limitations. The
local AAFES HRO is the LN program manager or OPR for AAFES LN PSIs. The sponsoring
unit or organization, in close coordination with the contracting office is responsible for LN
contractor PSIs.

A27.7. (Added-USAFE) Suitability Determinations. When derogatory or unfavorable
information is identified on a HAC, LFC, and or FBI check, a suitability determination is
required. Local procedures must allow for termination of employment when the investigation is
deemed unfavorable, and provided such information is sufficient to support termination action in
accordance with host country laws and or labor agreements.

A27.8. (Added-USAFE) Records. The OPR will retain the original copy of the completed AF
Form 2583, HAC, USAFE Form 19, and all other associated documents (when applicable), to
include LFC results, and FBI cases, and suitability determination memorandum on file, normally
in the LN employee’s security file or other employee file. All documents will be retained so long
as the LN is employed, after which time they will be destroyed.

   CIVILIAN PERSONNEL FLIGHTS (CPF) AND HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICES
                               (HRO)

A28.1. (Added-USAFE) General. As prescribed throughout this instruction, CPF and HRO
have specific responsibilities and requirements in support of the Personnel Security program.
This attachment further clarifies those responsibilities and outlines additional responsibilities and
requirements that apply to CPF and HRO within USAFE.

A28.2. (Added-USAFE) CPFs:

    A28.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Initial PSIs. The CPF is responsible for the submission of all
    NAC/ NACIC PSIs for appropriated fund DoD civilian employees assigned to non-sensitive
    position and initial ANACI PSIs for appropriated fund DoD civilian employees assigned to
    noncritical sensitive positions. The CPF is not responsible for the submission of initial PSIs
    for appropriated fund DoD civilian employees assigned to any critical sensitive position.
    The appropriate USM will submit all initial PSIs for appropriated fund DoD civilian
    employees assigned to a critical sensitive position to the Air Force (AF) authorized
    requester.

    A28.2.2. (Added-USAFE) PRs. The CPF is not responsible for the submission of any PRs
    for appropriated fund DoD civilian employees, regardless of the position sensitivity. The
    appropriate USM will submit all PRs for appropriated fund DoD civilians to the SF
    authorized requester.

    A28.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Verification of Prior Federal Employment and PSIs. The CPF
    will verify all prior federal employment and PSIs for appropriated fund DoD civilian
    employees to determine whether a PSI must be submitted. JPAS will be utilized to verify
    prior PSIs. If verification confirms continuous prior federal employment with no break in
    service longer than 24 months and the prior completion of the appropriate PSI for the
    sensitivity of the position, no further action is required; otherwise, a new PSI is required.
    Recertification of previous PSIs is no longer required.

    A28.2.4. (Added-USAFE) LFC. Although AFI 31-501, paragraph A2.6.3. states the AF
    Form 2583 is not needed for civilian applicants for federal employment when local files are
    unavailable, this exemption has been overcome by events and technology. An SF and
    medical records LFC is required. If a medical record is not available, the medical facility
    will annotate same on the AF Form 2583. The CPF will complete an AF Form 2583 for all
    new DoD civilian employees prior to the submission of any PSI. The CPF will retain the
    original copy of the completed AF Form 2583 on file until the investigation is closed and
    favorably adjudicated as verified in JPAS.

      OPM.

      A28.2.7. (Added-USAFE) Suitability Determinations. PSIs adjudicated No Determination
      Made by the CAF require a suitability determination.

      A28.2.8. (Added-USAFE) Disposition of Submitted PSIs:

        A28.2.8.1. (Added-USAFE) The CPF will maintain a copy of all submitted PSIs and
        other required documentation, normally in the employee’s security file, until the PSI is
        completed, adjudicated by the CAF and reflected in JPAS.

A28.3. (Added-USAFE) HRO:

      A28.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Initial PSIs.As outlined in paragraph 3.25. (Added), AFI 34-

        positions of trust are identified by HRO management and require completion of a NAC.
        Examples of positions which may be considered positions of trust are managers, funds
        custodians, general cashiers, positions involved in handling large amounts of cash or
        high-value merchandise, and employees working in areas containing valuable and
        pilferable material or equipment. Candidates for assignment to positions of trust will be
        scrutinized. A NAC must be completed before placing an individual in a position of
        trust. When completion of the NAC is not practical prior to entry on duty, the NAC is
        requested at the time of appointment and the employee may occupy the position with the
        prior written approval of the Services commander or director or designated
        representative.
        A28.3.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Other US Nonappropriated Fund Positions. All other
        nonappropriated fund positions that have not been designated as positions of trust require
        the completion of a LFC before entry on duty.
   A28.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Verification of Prior Federal Employment and PSIs. The

   longer than 24 months and the prior completion of the appropriate PSI for the sensitivity of
   the position, no further action is required; otherwise, a new PSI is required. Recertification of
   previous PSIs is no longer required.
   A28.3.3. (Added-USAFE) LFC. Although AFI 31-501, paragraph A2.6.3. states the AF

A29.1. (Added) (USAFE) General. The HQ AAFES Security Office (LP-SO) is the OPR for
the AAFES clearance and PSI program, and the local AAFES HRO is responsible for managing
the program. The AF has entered into a formal agreement with AAFES to process security
clearance PSIs for AF military personnel assigned to AAFES and AAFES US civilian
employees. These AAFES PSIs will be submitted by SF authorized requesters.
   A29.1.1. (Added-USAFE) AAFES US Civilian Employees. AAFES US civilian
   employees assigned to a position requiring clearance eligibility require a PSI, both initial and
   PRs. These positions are identified on an AAFES Organizational Management File (OMF)
   maintained by each AAFES HRO.
   A29.1.2. (Added-USAFE) AF Military Personnel Assigned To AAFES. All AF military
   personnel assigned to AAFES require initial PSIs and PRs commensurate with the IC for
   their position.
A29.2. (Added-USAFE) Submitting PSIs:

   requesters will enter the appropriate information for submitted PSIs in JPAS when all
   required documentation for the PSI is received, reviewed and validated, and mailed to OPM.
   A29.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Disposition of Submitted PSIs. Once an AAFES PSI is mailed
   to OPM or submitted electronically via e-QIP, SF authorized requesters will, if applicable,
   return the PSI file to AAFES. SF authorized requesters are not required to keep AAFES PSIs
   on file nor are they required to monitor or conduct any follow up actions.

   EMPLOYMENT BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS FOR NON-US NATIONAL
               PERSONNEL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM

 This process has been transferred to USAFE/A7S. It is listed here until inclusion in AFI
 31-101_USAFESUP

A34.1. (Added-USAFE) General. This attachment identifies investigative requirements for non-
US citizens employed by, or contracted or subcontracted to the US Government and its entities to
work on installations within the United Kingdom (UK) (hereinafter collectively referred to as
employees unless otherwise stated). Unless specifically noted, all reference to employees is in
relation to non-US citizen employees. The requirements for contractors and subcontractors are
the same as those for employees unless stated otherwise.

A34.2. (Added-USAFE) Investigative Requirements. It is incumbent upon the hiring agency to
ensure that only personnel with appropriate background investigations are employed or
contracted (to include subcontracted) by the US Government and its entities to work on
installations within the UK. In the case of contractors, the hiring agency is defined as the US
agency or organization for which the work is being performed. Contractor organizations are able
to hire whoever they wish, but in order for those personnel to gain unescorted access to United
States Air Force-occupied UK bases or to work in sensitive positions, they must complete the
investigation requirements set down in this instruction.
   A34.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Personnel employed by DoD components overseas, whose
   duties do not require access to classified information, require a National Agency Check
   (NAC) equivalent investigation. The NAC equivalent investigation will be completed on all
   employees and some contractors to include subcontractors as stated in paragraph A34.2.
   (Added). As a minimum, the NAC must consist of:
       A34.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Host government law enforcement and security agency
       checks at the city, state (province), and national level, whenever permissible by the laws
       of the host government. In the UK, this Host Agency Check (HAC) is conducted by the
       Ministry of Defence (MOD) Defence Vetting Agency (DVA).
       A34.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) A Defense Clearance and Investigation Index (DCII)
       check. Installation security forces (SF) will conduct the DCII check for all employees.
       A34.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) check. All
       potential employees will complete a USAFE Form 19, Residency Check for Employment
       with US Air Forces in Europe. When determined that a prospective employee resided in
       the US for 12 or more consecutive months since age 18, the hiring agency will forward
       the USAFE Form 19 to SFS who in-turn will forward to AFOSI, which will request an
       FBI name check. The FBI check consists of a review of files for information of a security
       nature. AFOSI will provide the results to the installation Security Forces Administration
       and Reports (SFA) Flight.
       A34.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Local Files Check (LFC). The LFC is a check of local
       SF files to uncover the existence of unfavorable information. The LFC will consist of a
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                              167


       SF records check in the Security Forces Management Information System and a check of
       the installation barment roster.
       A34.2.1.5. (Added-USAFE) When these investigations are completed, they will be
       recorded on AF Form 2583, Request for Personnel Security Action, in the remarks
       section, section VII. The note should include, at a minimum, type of investigation, date
       completed and whether the results were favorable or not.
A34.3. (Added-USAFE) Background Investigations. There are three levels of background
investigations that meet the standards set down by this and higher-level instructions in reference
to para A34.2.1.1. (Added) of this attachment. The level of background check required will
depend on whether the position is considered sensitive or non-sensitive. Attachment 36
(Added) identifies sensitive positions. Employment is dependent upon the employee having
updated clearance checks.
   A34.3.1. (Added-USAFE) The Counter Terrorist Check (CTC). The CTC is a national-
   level security and police background investigation conducted by the DVA. This is the
   minimum check required for all employees in non-sensitive positions and for
   contractors/subcontractors in non-sensitive positions requiring unescorted installation access.
   The CTC expires three years from the issue date. The expiration date on USAFE Form 77,
   Base Entry Identification, based on a CTC will not exceed 3 years from the issue date of the
   CTC. If an employee's employment exceeds this 3 years, they must have the CTC
   investigation renewed.
   A34.3.2. (Added-USAFE) The Security Check (SC). The SC includes all of the elements
   of the CTC but is a more comprehensive investigation and includes such actions as a credit
   check, interviewing relatives, determining and evaluating the individual’s involvement in
   various organizations, verifying any past military experience, etc. This is the minimum
   check required for employees and contractor personnel in sensitive positions. Most SCs
   expire 5 years from the issue date. The expiration date on the USAFE Form 77 based on the
   SC will not exceed 5 years from the issue date of the USAFE Form 77, expiration of the
   contract or the expiration date of the SC whichever is less. If an employee's employment
   exceeds the expiration date on their SC, they must have the SC investigation renewed. If
   DVA has determined the SC is good for longer than 5 years, an investigation renewal will
   not be required until the expiration date of the SC as determined by DVA, but a USAFE
   Form 77 cannot be issued for longer than 5 years at one time.
   A34.3.3. (Added-USAFE) The Developed Vetting (DV). This higher level of security
   background investigation is needed for the most sensitive jobs and tasks. DVs are normally
   not required for Air Force needs; however if Air Force civilian employees support another
   mission which requires the DV, then the supported mission will be responsible for funding
   the DVs.
   A34.3.4. (Added-USAFE) Investigation renewal. All employees renewing their
   background investigation will complete an MOD Form 1109, Security Questionnaire. On the
   front cover of the form, under General Details, the employee will mark the appropriate block
   indicating a security questionnaire has been completed before and will complete the form
   with current information. Refer to para A34.13. (Added) for the submittal process. This
   renewal process must be validated and submitted by the hiring or sponsoring organization 6
168                         AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


   months prior to the current background expiration date to avoid a possible lapse in
   employment and installation access.
A34.4. (Added-USAFE) Position Sensitivity. All positions, to include contractor positions,
must be assigned a position sensitivity based on the duties and responsibilities of the position.
Most positions are considered non-sensitive unless their duties and responsibilities dictate
otherwise. For examples of sensitive positions, refer to Attachment 36 (Added). The minimum
check required for sensitive positions is the SC.
   A34.4.1. (Added-USAFE) The sponsoring agency or unit (hiring agency) and a designated
   representative from the SFS will jointly determine if a position is sensitive based upon the
   nature, scope and sensitivity of the work being performed. Before the hiring process begins,
   all on-base job descriptions, contracts, or other position descriptions must clearly state that
   the duty position is non-sensitive or sensitive before any hiring or legally binding contract
   begins.
       A34.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If the position cannot be jointly determined as sensitive or
       non-sensitive, the installation commander is the final determining authority. The
       installation commander may delegate this authority no lower than the mission support
       group deputy commander (MSG/ CD).
       A34.4.1.2. (Added-USAFE) GSU commanders will not delegate this authority.
   A34.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Multi-base Non-US Employees and Contractors. Where
   positions exist that require an employee to have access to multiple US occupied installations,
   those installations must jointly determine position sensitivity. If differences cannot be
   resolved at the installation commander level, HQ USAFE/A7S is the final decision authority.
   This authority can be delegated to HQ USAFE/ A7SX.
   A34.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Once the LFC and DCII checks have been favorably completed
   and the MOD Form 1109 submitted to SF, personnel hired in non-sensitive positions can
   begin to work. With the same checks completed, a person hired in a sensitive position can
   work in the non-sensitive portions of their job. They can also be permitted to work in the
   sensitive portions under constant supervision. This does not include having LAN access or
   unescorted access to restricted areas. Personnel will not be granted installation unescorted
   access until the LFC, DCII, FBI and HAC checks are favorably completed. Positive control
   is required at all times for personnel escorted on the installation. Individuals escorting will
   keep all escorted individuals in line of sight at all times while on the installation.
A34.5. (Added-USAFE) Minimum Investigative Requirements for Non US National
Employment.
   A34.5.1. (Added-USAFE) (Added-USAFE) For prospective employees, the LFC d DCII
   checks must be completed and the CTC/SC/DV and FBI (if required) checks submitted prior
   to employment. Until all required checks are completed, personnel will not be granted
   unescorted access to installations and will require continuous supervision by a qualified and
   authorized escort. The hiring or sponsoring organization must plan for and provide
   authorizes escort officials for their personnel.
   A34.5.2. (Added-USAFE) The hiring agency must receive official notice from the MOD
   Liaison Office (MODLO) that the DVA has granted the prospective employee the
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                              169


   appropriate DVA clearance. This notice will be given via the installation SFA. The Basic
   Check (BC) must be favorably completed prior to the CTC/SC/DV being authorized.
   A34.5.3. (Added-USAFE) All employees requiring unclassified LAN IT level 3 access or
   unescorted entry into PL 3 restricted areas must have a fully completed favorable NAC
   before access is granted. Interim access is prohibited.
A34.6. (Added-USAFE) MOD Personnel. MOD indirect-hire employees have sufficient
clearance and are not required to go through additional checks.

A34.7. (Added-USAFE) Defence Estates and the RAF Station Warden. Once position
sensitivity is jointly determined with the Security Forces, the local Defence Estates and Royal
Air Force (RAF) Station Warden must function as their own authorized requestor and deal
directly with DVA for MOD Form 1109 submissions, tracking, and security clearance actions on
their prospective employees, contractors, subcontractors, sponsored or supervised persons.
Defence Estates or RAF Station Warden must submit a valid MOD Form 1109 to DVA to
initiate the HAC process and consequently must administer all coordination with DVA
background investigations. Upon receipt of a favorable DVA clearance notification, Defence
Estates or RAF Station Warden must provide the security forces a signed verification letter with
the employees completed DVA clearance type, certificate number, issue date, and expiration
date. If the position meets local criteria and duties require an escort capability, the sponsoring
unit authorized pass requestor annotates the USAFE Form 79, Request for Base Entry
Identification, block 16B as yes and enters Escort Official as the sign-in privilege explanation on
the pass request.
A34.8. (Added-USAFE) Third Country Nationals (TCN).
   A34.8.1. (Added-USAFE) TCN Dependents of US Personnel. TCN dependents of US
   personnel require the appropriate US background investigation, NAC Personnel Security
   Investigation, commensurate with the position instead of the UK DVA investigation. If a
   TCN dependent has a current DVA CTC/SC/DV, this is sufficient to meet the requirements
   of this instruction. It is the responsibility of the hiring agency to ensure the appropriate
   investigation is submitted for TCN employees.
   A34.8.2. (Added-USAFE) Other TCNs. The employment of TCNs other than dependents
   of US personnel is largely dependent on the individual’s permission to be ―in‖ and ―work in‖
   the UK and the DVA's response to the investigation request. If the DVA responds to the
   request that they are unable to complete the required investigation, the individual cannot be
   employed. Before employment, the hiring agency/unit will verify in writing that the TCN
   has received permission and, or authority to be in and work in the UK by the Host Nation.
A34.9. (Added-USAFE) US Citizens in Local National (LN) Positions. US citizens selected
for LN funded positions or billets, to include applicable contractor positions, must complete the
appropriate US background investigation requirements, unless they have a current DVA CTC,
SC, or DV check commensurate with the position. The hiring agencies' unit security manager
(USM) will submit such personnel through the US personnel security investigation system.

A34.10. (Added-USAFE) Suitability Determinations. An employment suitability
determination is required when derogatory or unfavorable information is identified on an LFC,
DCII and, or FBI check. Local procedures must allow for termination of employment when an
170                         AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


employee's information is deemed "unfavorable," providing such information is sufficient to
support termination action in accordance with host country laws and, or labor agreements.
Personnel who have unfavorable information identified during an LFC, DCII or FBI check may
not be hired in any capacity until a suitability determination is "favorably" completed.
Installation commanders are the final authority to determine employment suitability if derogatory
information is identified on the LFC, DCII or FBI check. Commanders may delegate this
authority to, but not lower than, the MSG/CD. All suitability determination results must be
documented in a formal memorandum. Personnel who are denied a DVA clearance must appeal
the decision to DVA. If DVA again denies the clearance it may be appealed to the Secretary
Security Vetting Appeals Panel after which, if denied again, this is sufficient mitigation and the
individual will be denied access to the installation and cannot resume employment. During the
appeals process or after initial notification of the denied clearance, the individual cannot be
employed, until a favorable DVA clearance is obtained.
   A34.10.1. (Added-USAFE) Suitability determinations for information received from the
   LFC, DCII or FBI checks will be accomplished using the following procedures.
       A34.10.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The local SF commander will assess the information and
       provide a written opinion as to whether the information demonstrates an actual or
       potential security risk.
       A34.10.1.2. (Added-USAFE) If, in the opinion of the local SF commander, the
       information does not represent a security risk, the opinion shall be passed directly to the
       hiring agency commander.
       A34.10.1.3. (Added-USAFE) If, in the opinion of the local SF commander, the
       information poses an actual or potential security risk; this adverse opinion will be
       forwarded to the servicing base legal office for a legal review.
           A34.10.1.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Following the legal review, the adverse opinion will
           be forwarded either to (a) the Civilian Personnel Office (CPO) or appropriate
           personnel office (AAFES, Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) or Department of
           Defense Dependent School (DoDDS)) for directly hired personnel or (b) the
           commander of the hiring agency for contractor or subcontractor personnel.
           A34.10.1.3.2. (Added-USAFE) For prospective directly hired applicants, the
           appropriate personnel office will provide an opinion to the applicable commander as
           to whether the adverse opinion provides a basis upon which to refuse employment.
           A34.10.1.3.3. (Added-USAFE) For directly hired employees or prospective directly
           hired applicants, the appropriate personnel office will forward the adverse opinion,
           the legal review and personnel office opinion to the hiring agency commander. If the
           commander wishes to continue the individual’s employment or accept a prospective
           applicant for employment, he or she must forward a written request, through the
           appropriate SFS, to the appropriate installation commander or designated
           representative for final determination. This determination authority cannot be
           delegated below the MSG/CD or GSU commander.
           A34.10.1.3.4. (Added-USAFE) For contractor or subcontractor personnel, the
           hiring agency’s commander determines whether the adverse opinion provides a basis
           upon which to refuse access to the installation. If the commander wishes to allow the
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                             171


          individual installation access to perform contracted work, he or she must forward a
          written request, through the appropriate SFS, to the appropriate installation
          commander (or designated representative) for final determination. This determination
          authority cannot be delegated below the MSG/CD or GSU commander.
   A34.10.2. (Added-USAFE) If the individual has been issued a USAFE Form 77 the hiring
   agency/ unit will recover the identification (ID) media.
      A34.10.2.1. (Added-USAFE) For contractor or subcontractor personnel, SF will
      notify the hiring agency upon notification by MODLO that a contractor employee has
      been denied a DVA clearance for cause. The hiring agency will notify the appropriate
      Contracting Officer who will inform the contractor. If the contractor employee already
      possesses a USAFE Form 77, SF will notify the hiring agency that the card must be taken
      from the individual until a final determination is made. SF will also notify the
      installation commander of the situation immediately. Defence Estates and RAF Station
      Warden will notify Security Forces (SF) of DVA clearances that are denied for cause,
      residency or no determination made. Appeals or suitability determinations must follow
      procedures in paragraph A34.10. (Added).
A34.11. (Added-USAFE) Procedures to follow when DVA will not grant a clearance and in
marginal cases.
   A34.11.1. (Added-USAFE) If DVA cannot grant a clearance because it is unable to
   conduct the background check for any reason, the person being checked cannot be employed.
   For TCN dependents of US personnel, the guidance provided in para A34.8.1. (Added) must
   be followed.
   A34.11.2. (Added-USAFE) "Marginal Cases" are cases in which DVA requires more
   information about the position an individual is being hired for before it can make a
   determination. The Security Forces SFA Flight Chief will act as the DVA single point of
   contact to receive DVA Marginal Cases.
A34.12. (Added-USAFE) Financing DVA Investigations.
   A34.12.1. (Added-USAFE) Directorate of Logistics (HQ USAFE/A4) will enter into and
   maintain currency of an Acquisition and Cross-Service Agreement (ACSC) with the British
   MOD to conduct investigations as listed in this instruction. As required, HQ USAFE/A7S is
   responsible for providing HQ USAFE/A4 amplifying instructions to be included as an
   attachment to the ACSC.
   A34.12.2. (Added-USAFE) Installations will develop procedures to transfer the appropriate
   amount of funds to MODLO in order to pay for the DVA investigations in accordance with
   the US-UK Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreement. Each month, MODLO will forward a
   billing invoice listing completed background checks to the installation SFS. SF will validate
   that the invoice is accurate and forward it to the installation comptroller squadron which will
   charge the appropriate organizations and pay the bill to MODLO.
A34.13. (Added-USAFE) Procedures for Obtaining a DVA Background Investigation.
   A34.13.1. (Added-USAFE) Applicant, proposed employee will:
      A34.13.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Complete MOD Form 1109 and provide to the employer.
172                          AFI31-501_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012


        A34.13.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Along with the completed MOD Form 1109, provide the
        employer with identification credentials and references in accordance with MOD
        procedures clarified in Table A34.1. (Added) and Paragraph A34.15. (Added).
      A34.13.2. (Added-USAFE) Hiring Agency will:
        A34.13.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Coordinate MOD Forms 1109 submissions with SFS.
        A34.13.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Verify completion of the Basic Check (BCVR) by
        confirming the employee’s identification using credentials as listed in Table A34.1.
        (Added) and ensuring the appropriate references as defined in paragraph A34.15.
        (Added) are in order. When the BCVR is completed in conjunction with a SC/CTC, only
        one reference is required. The employing agency representative that completed the check
        must sign the BCVR.
        A34.13.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Have the employee complete the USAFE Form
        19. When information identifies residence by the potential employee in the US for 12 or
        more consecutive months since age 18, the hiring agency will forward the USAFE Form
        19 to SFS who will forward to AFOSI, which will request a FBI name check.
        A34.13.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Verify that the MOD Form 1109 turned in by the
        employee is completed properly with all of the necessary information.
        A34.13.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Forward the completed MOD Form 1109 and other
        security forms to the installation SFA flight.
        A34.13.2.6. (Added-USAFE) When informed by SFA that all investigations, checks are
        complete with favorable results, complete a USAFE Form 79 and have employee hand-
        carry the form to SFA with identification credentials.
        A34.13.2.7. (Added-USAFE) Once this process is completed, maintain the BCVR,
        USAFE Form 19, AF Form 2583, USAFE Form 79 and any DVA clearance information
        as long as the employee remains with the employing agency. All documents must be
        readily available for Security Forces or Higher Headquarters inspections and verification.
        A34.13.2.8. (Added-USAFE) Retrieve the USAFE Form 77 from the employee if the
        employment is terminated prior to the USAFE Form 77’s expiration date.
        A34.13.2.9. (Added-USAFE) Report any negative information received on an
        employee during the time of employment to the installation SF so it can be determined by
        DVA if such information will affect the clearance held.
        A34.13.2.10. (Added-USAFE) Contact SF in all cases when employment is terminated.
   A34.13.3. (Added-USAFE) The hiring or sponsoring organization USMs should track
   investigations and notify employees of the need for reinvestigation requirements prior to the
   expiration of the current check (refer to para A34.3.4. (Added)). If an employee’s
   investigation expires prior to their employment being terminated, they will not maintain
   unescorted access to the installation.
   A34.13.4. Installation SF will:
        A34.13.4.1. Ensure accessibility of MOD form 1109 for agencies/units.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                        173


      A34.13.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Receive and review the MOD Form 1109 (or signed
      verification letters from Defence Estates or RAF Station Warden) from the hiring agency
      for completeness. Return to requesting agency/unit for any corrections needed.
      A34.13.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Forward the correct MOD Form 1109 to MODLO.
      A34.13.4.4. (Added-USAFE) Review the BCVR to ensure the proper BC was
      conducted on the employee.
      A34.13.4.5. (Added-USAFE) Notify MODLO anytime information is received from
      the hiring agency requiring a DVA background investigation on a proposed employee to
      be terminated.
      A34.13.4.6. (Added-USAFE) Ensure completion of LFC and DCII check and as
      appropriate, request AFOSI coordinate FBI check on personnel who indicate residence in
      the US for one year or more since age 18. Annotate as stated in para A34.2.1.5. (Added)
      of this attachment.
      A34.13.4.7. Receive the Clearance Notification Form from MODLO.
      A34.13.4.8. (Added-USAFE) Notify the hiring agency of the background investigation
      results.
      A34.13.4.9. (Added-USAFE) Verify the employee's identity and annotate on the
      employee’s USAFE Form 79 that all required checks were completed. Have employee
      hand carry the USAFE Form 79 to Pass and Registration to be issued a USAFE Form 77.
      A34.13.4.10. (Added-USAFE) Upon notification from the hiring agency, up-channel
      any negative information received on an employee to MODLO for consideration by
      DVA. DVA may determine that the information has a negative impact on the clearance
      held by that employee.
      A34.13.4.11. (Added-USAFE) Contact MODLO in all cases where employment is
      terminated.
   A34.13.5. (Added-USAFE) GSU SFAs will complete all of the actions listed under para
   A34.13.4. (Added) except they will forward documents and information to 100 SFS/SFA for
   submission to MODLO and receive the DVA results from the submitting SFA.
   A34.13.6. (Added-USAFE) MODLO will:
      A34.13.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Receive completed MOD Form 1109 from SFS.
      A34.13.6.2. (Added-USAFE) Sign MOD Form 1109 as sponsor, submit form to DVA
      and receive the results.

A34.15. (Added-USAFE) DVA Reference Restrictions for the BC (from MOD JSP 440,
Manual of Protective Security).
   A34.15.1. (Added-USAFE) Reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that the reference
   and referees are genuine, especially where the reference is less than convincing, for example,
   it is written on poor quality paper or contains spelling or grammatical errors.
   A34.15.2. (Added-USAFE) Where a BC is being carried out as the groundwork for a SC or
   DV, or in conjunction with a CTC, only one reference is needed. This should be from the
   individual’s most recent employer and should cover a period of one year or from a previous
   employer for the same period. If an employer’s reference is not available, a personal or
   academic reference should be obtained.
   A34.15.3. (Added-USAFE) Depending on the individual’s circumstances, the following
   references may also be required:
      A34.15.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Where an individual has been overseas for more than 6
      months during the previous 3 years, every effort should be made to get a reference from
      the overseas employer.
      A34.15.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Where, for any reason, an employer’s reference is not
      available, a second personal reference should be obtained from a referee nominated by
      the individual. (This is not necessary if the period of coverage is less than 6 months).
      A34.15.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Where an individual has been in full time education

A35.1. (Added-USAFE) Program Overview. Local National (LN) personnel require a
favorably completed NAC equivalent background investigation prior to employment with the
Department of Defense (DOD) in Germany. Based on agreements between USAFE and United
States Army in Europe (USAREUR), the primary background investigation requirement for LNs
in Germany, with the exception of those LNs hired before 3 October 1985, is the German Police
Good Conduct Certificate (PGCC/Polizeiliches Führungszeugnis), a USAREUR Local National
Screening (LNS), Local Files Check (LFC), Defense Central Index of Investigations (DCII)
check, and an FBI check when information exists that indicates residence by the non-U.S. citizen
in the United States for 12 or more consecutive months since the age of 18; hereafter referred to
as the LNS program. Local national employees hired prior to 3 October 1985 were the subject of
an appropriate investigation and will not be investigated under LNS.
   A35.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Applicability. The Local National Screening background
   investigation requirement applies to the following personnel.
       A35.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) LN appropriated and nonappropriated fund employees, to
       include permanent, temporary, and or seasonal employees (hereafter referred to as
       employees), who were hired after 3 October 1985 and have resided in Germany for the
       past twelve or more consecutive months.
       A35.1.1.2. (Added-USAFE) LN contractors, subcontractors, and employees (here after
       referred to as contractors) who were hired after 3 October 1985, have resided in Germany
       for the past twelve or more consecutive months and are under contract for performance
       on USAFE installations within Germany, and:
           A35.1.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Are in a sensitive position (Attachment 36 (Added))
           or require unescorted entry into USAFE installations within Germany.
       A35.1.1.3. (Added-USAFE) LN vendors, commercial solicitors, delivery personnel,
       etc. (hereafter referred to as vendors), who were hired after 3 October 1985, have resided
       in Germany for the past twelve or more consecutive months, and require unescorted entry
       into USAFE installations within Germany.
   A35.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Non-Applicability. The LNS investigation requirements do not
   apply to the following personnel.
       A35.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) LNs with an approved Limited Access Authorization
       (LAA) and a completed and adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI)
       and or SSBI Periodic Reinvestigation (SBPR).
       A35.1.2.2. (Added-USAFE) LNs with a completed and adjudicated SSBI and or SBPR
       for unescorted entry into Protection Level (PL) 1 and 2, and or unclassified Information
       Technology (IT) (formerly Automated Information Systems (AIS)) level 1 or 2 access.

     A35.1.2.3. (Added-USAFE) LNs hired before 3 October 1985. (Note: LNs hired before
     3 October 1985 have met/comply with all investigative requirements for employment
     with the DOD in Germany. Therefore, it is prohibited to require and or request these LNs
     to submit further/additional background investigation under LNS.)
     A35.1.2.4. LNs who are:
         A35.1.2.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Ineligible to have a FNS completed or obtain the
         PGCC because their country of residence is other than Germany or they have not
         resided in Germany for the past twelve or more consecutive months. Local Nationals
         in this situation will comply with the requirements listed in paragraph A35.15.
         (Added), appendix 1 and will have a Local Files and DCII check. Additionally, an

     October 1985, and have resided in Germany for the past twelve or more consecutive
     months, will comply with the LNS background investigation requirements prescribed in
     this instruction. However, if these personnel have a previously completed and favorable
     US personnel security investigation commensurate with the requirements of the position,
     it will satisfy the LNS requirement. The US equivalent investigation can only be accepted
     if the individual previously worked for the DOD and the break in employment is less than
     24 months.
     A35.1.3.2. (Added-USAFE) LN dependents of US personnel, to include third country
     national (TCN) dependents, who have not resided in Germany for the past twelve or more
     consecutive months are not required to comply with the LNS background investigation
     requirements. Instead, these personnel will:
         A35.1.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Provide their country's equivalent of the PGCC (refer
         to paragraph A35.15. (Added)); and or:
         A35.1.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Submit the appropriate US personnel security
         investigation commensurate with the requirements for the position of employment.

         investigation may vary depending on the sensitivity of the position.
  A35.1.4. (Added-USAFE) US Citizens (Non-DoD Affiliated). Non-DoD affiliated US
  citizens must comply with the LNS background investigation requirements if they were hired

   A35.13.1. (Added-USAFE) CPF and HRO. CPF and HRO will file and maintain
   background investigation results either in the individual’s Official Personnel File (OPF) or in
   a separate security file or folder. It is strongly recommended CPF and HRO establish a
   separate security file or folder. Whether filed and maintained in the OPF or separate security
   file or folder, the LN background investigation results will not contain any adverse
   information or suitability determination decision results. These will be maintained by the
   servicing SFA as identified below.
   A35.13.2. (Added-USAFE) SFA. SFA will establish and maintain a security file or folder
   on:
A35.13.2.1. (Added-USAFE) All LNs for which they submit a FNS to USAREUR.
A35.13.2.2. (Added-USAFE) All LNs with adverse information and suitability determination.
   A35.13.3. (Added-USAFE) Safeguarding. The PGCC and LNS results, to include adverse
   information provided by USAREUR and suitability determinations are considered an
   investigative agency case and foreign source information. It must be safeguarded as
   prescribed in DoDD 5200.2, Chapter 10 and in the USAREUR memorandum provided with
   all adverse information reports.
A35.14. (Added-USAFE) Program Oversight. Information Security Program Managers
(ISPM) will review the installation LNS program annually during the appropriate unit’s annual
program review and include a separate paragraph in the program review report that specifically
addresses the program.
A35.15. (Added-USAFE) Background Investigation Requirements for Other Local
Nationals.
   A35.15.1. (Added-USAFE) It is not uncommon for a LN to be ineligible for a FNS because
   their country of residence is other than Germany or because they have not resided in
   Germany for the past twelve or more consecutive months. Examples include a LN who
   resides in a country other than Germany and is seeking employment and or unescorted
   installation access on a USAFE installation within Germany, a LN vendor from a country
   other than Germany who requires unescorted installation access to sell their merchandise
   during a sponsored event, etc. In cases such as these, the following requirements apply.
       A35.15.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If the LN is not a German resident and or has not resided
       in Germany for the past twelve or more consecutive months, the LN must provide their
       country's equivalent of the PGCC. The PGCC equivalent document must:
           A35.15.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Be the original (copies are prohibited) copy in or
           translated into English, and notarized.
           A35.15.1.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Reflect a favorable background investigation
           result. If the PGCC equivalent document is not favorable and or other information is
           identified, a suitability determination must be completed.
           A35.15.1.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Be dated within 90 days of the entry on duty
           date. If the PGCC equivalent document is 91 days old or older at the entry on duty
           date, a new PGCC equivalent document must be obtained.
       A35.15.1.2. (Added-USAFE) All other additional LN security related processes,
       procedures, and requirements apply. These include the additional mandatory security
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_ MILDENHALLSUP_I 26 APRIL 2012                                            185


        checks for LN employees, contractors, and or vendors; specifically, FBI check where
        information exists that indicates residence by the non-US citizen in the US for twelve or
        more consecutive months since age 18, DCII, and a Local Files Check.
   A35.15.2. (Added-USAFE) As with the PGCC conducted in Germany, the PGCC
   equivalent conducted in most other countries is limited only to a criminal courts records
   check over the previous 5-7 years, depending on the criminal offense. Since these host
   country PGCCs do not provide the same level and scope of background investigation check
   as the FNS, additional measures and considerations must be taken; specifically:
        A35.15.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Closely scrutinize unescorted installation              access
        requirements and limit the number of days and times when access is allowed.
        A35.15.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Deny unescorted installation access sign-in privileges.
        A35.15.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Limit employment and or contract performance only to
        non-sensitive positions.
   A35.15.3. (Added-USAFE) Within the USAFE Theater of operations, LN background
   investigation requirements and processes vary from country to country. While most countries
   only conduct a criminal courts records check similar to the German PGCC, within the United
   Kingdom, the Ministry of Defence conducts a full background investigation similar to the
   USAREUR LNS. When utilizing the background investigation results from a country within
   the USAFE Theater of operation, it is important to ensure the results are not only valid, but
   also the correct type for that particular country. CPF, HRO, and or SF should contact their
   USAFE counterpart in the appropriate country to determine the specific LN background
   investigation requirements and processes.
