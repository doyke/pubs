This manual provides policy and procedures to record and display long-range workload planning, repair
program management and customer requirements. This manual applies to all Air Force organizations that
prepare, manage, review, approve, or use the depot level maintenance requirements information contained
in and produced by the MP&E system. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed
in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363),
Management of Records, and disposed in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This manual has been revised to incorporate major corrections, clarifications, and relevant information
from other directives. It has been substantially realigned for clarity and ease of reading and should be read
in its entirety. Furthermore, it eliminates duplication of procedures for long-range requirements, engines,
exchangeables, other major end items (OMEI), deletes references to control and management of the cus-
tomer program authority, and revises all attachments.

                                 POLICIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Purpose. The Maintenance Planning and Execution (MP&E) system provides maintenance program
planning, execution, and management functionality for maintaining major and secondary items. MP&E is
a depot level maintenance requirements and program management system. It provides a single source of
requirements managed by the Air Logistics Center (ALC) and other Air Force Logistics facilities. It is the
system of record for establishing and assigning Production Control Numbers (PCNs). The information
this system provides is used to address issues as they pertain to posturing depot maintenance facilities and
development of requirement budgets. The information is also used to answer questions from a wide vari-
ety of sources, such as Air Staff, Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD), Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA),
and General Accounting Office (GAO) and also from internal AFMC staff personnel. It provides financial
resource managers and all other levels of management with the instrument to project and to manage cus-
tomer financial resources effectively and efficiently by displaying a total picture, stratification for specific
areas of management attention, and details requiring individual attention. MP&E portrays customer
requirements, programs, workload identity, source of repair, and reimbursement customer.

1.2. General. The system provides information used to posture depot maintenance facilities and the
development of the Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG) budget. Additionally, MP&E provides
information to support these maintenance activities; Logistics Support Review (LSR), Workload Review,
50/50, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), Biannual Core Review, Maintenance Requirements
Review Board (MRRB), Supply Requirements Review Board (SRRB), and Posture Planning. The system
also provides Repair Program Managers with a standard for maintenance program planning and manage-
ment functionality for major and secondary items: Aircraft, Missiles, Engines, Other Major End Items
(OMEI), Exchangeables, Area Base Maintenance, Software, and Storage. MP&E is the single source for
each Depot’s maintenance requirements. MP&E provides a common system for negotiating maintenance
costs, schedules and the allocation of maintenance workload among organic and contract repair sources.
It contributes to improved materiel management processes by reducing the repair cycle requirements and
administrative lead-time, improving accuracy in determining the total order quantity to be procured, and
enhancing total asset visibility. This MP&E manual provides policy, procedures, and responsibilities for
developing long-range customer workload requirements for:
   1.2.1. Aircraft Mission Design/Mission Design Series (MD/MDS), RGCs A and B.
   1.2.2. Missiles, MD/MDS for RGCs C and D.
   1.2.3. Engines, Type/Type Model Series (TM/TMS), RGCs E and F.
   1.2.4. OMEI RGCs G and H.
   1.2.5. Exchangeables RGCs J, K and L.

1.3. Description:
    1.3.1. MP&E provides Repair Program Managers (RPM) with a standard system for performing the
    actions associated with planning for the maintenance of repairable items. MP&E provides a common
    system for programming repair requirements, breaking out maintenance workloads among organic,
    inter-service and contract sources of repair (SOR), and providing management of the maintenance
    programs. MP&E receives data through both manual file maintenance transactions and interfaces with
    other data systems. All incoming information is subject to various edits, audits, and compatibility
    checks. Any information not passing edits, audits, and checks is identified in the Alert Maintenance
    screen to the proper RPM for corrective action if necessary.
    1.3.2. Information accepted by the MP&E system is recorded and maintained in the Core database.
    The Information Delivery Facility (IDF) is used to retrieve data for reports and queries shown on out-
    put documents and data files from the Core database. Specific reports can be extracted from the
    MP&E Core and IDF databases.
    1.3.3. Information maintained in the MP&E Core database is identified by PCNs, with supporting
    information for current fiscal year (FY), seven out years, and three years of history.

     Product Actual Hours (DPAH) and Direct Product Standard Hours (DPSH), the capability for work-
     load pricing, interface data to other systems, and a master list of all RCC’s and their associated
     accepted workload factors.
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                             13


     1.5.1.1. G004C provides the MP&E system with PLA, DPAH, and DPSH at PCN level.
     1.5.1.2. Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System (DMAPS Data Store System),
     (DDSS). Weekly. Organic Project Order Register Data (OPORD) provides DMAG organic project
     order register data at PCN level; to include quantity, hours, and dollars; planned and completed.
     This information provides production progress within DMAG ALC organic production facilities
     and is used in various MP&E products.
  1.5.2. Exchangeables and OMEI. The following information applies:
     1.5.2.1. D075, Logistic Management Databank System (LMDBS), frequency weekly, receives
     and send interface.
         1.5.2.1.1. D075, interfaces into the MP&E system, the long-range DLM requirements for
         MISTR exchangeables. These requirements, computed by D200A and D200C systems at
         stock number level are passed to D075 for interface with MP&E. For the purpose of this regu-
         lation D075 and ABCS are synonymous.
         1.5.2.1.2. D075 provides the NSN and Work Performance Category (WPC), quantities for 32
         quarters, FY, Item Manager Designator Code (IMS), Production Manager Specialists Code,
         Subsystem Identification Text, Mission Item Essentiality Code, Expendability Recoverability
         Reparability Code, Unit of Issue Code, Unit Price Amount, Order of Use Code, Source of Sup-
         ply Code, Primary Item Number, PICA, SICA, Non-consumable Item Materiel Code, and item
         for programmed exchangeable workloads.
         1.5.2.1.3. These requirements should be adjusted in D075 before being passed to MP&E. The
         D075 interface to MP&E includes gross and adjusted requirements computed for 32 quarters
         by subgroup master and actual national stock number (NSN). Adjusted repair requirements
         will contain induction, or net input, from previous quarter and negotiated requirements for cur-
         rent quarter. D075 also provides Weapon System Application and Percents by subgroup mas-
         ter and actual NSNs.
         1.5.2.1.4. There are three conditions that will lead to having a NSN show up on the Exchange-
         able Requirements Section Window; (1) New NSN; (2) New NSN/WPC combination; and (3)
         Federal Stock Class (FSC) changed and is no longer valid for Technology Repair Center
         (TRC). The RPM must identify and assign this NSN to a valid MP&E SCN (PCN) in MP&E.
         1.5.2.1.5. D075 provides Weapon System Application and Percents received from D200A to
         MP&E. If for some reason MP&E receives no weapon system application/percents when the
         NSN is passed from D075, then MP&E will assign 100% Common. The RPM will be able to
         correct this discrepancy in MP&E, any other discrepancies with the weapon system percents
         need to be corrected in D200A.
  1.5.3. D101, Consolidated Analysis and Reporting System (CARS), applicable to WR-ALC only.
  This is a vehicle requirements, OMEI data file. Vehicle requirements under RGC G are mechanically
  provided by PCN level to MP&E from D101. This system combines data from various reporting sys-
  tems into one management information system (MIS) to improve vehicle management capability at
  WR-ALC. CARS consolidates, integrates, and assists in interpretation of vehicle data, captures the
  corporate knowledge of senior vehicle managers and documents the detailed process used.
  1.5.4. D200F, Applications, Programs and Indentures (API), a send only interface, data pertaining to
  modification schedule summary. API provides an integrated repository of indentured items, applica-
14                                                                  AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007


     tion data, weapon system force structure program activity, item identification and cataloging data for
     requirements determination systems. The indenture structure has next higher assemblies with their
     direct component parts, allowing weapon system item relationships to be traversed in the indenture
     structure from top-down or bottom-up.
     1.5.5. D357, Reparability Forecast Model (RFM), a send only interface, data pertaining to mainte-
     nance requirement master records. RFM performs a material forecast simulation of component item
     requirements over quarterly time segments for a vehicle end item maintenance repair requirement.
     RFM models the supplier chains of AFMC Depot Maintenance organizations to identify current and/
     or future component item shortfalls for active job order numbers at AFMC depots.
     1.5.6. DPEM, Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance Database, a send only interface, data per-
     taining to aircraft and missiles maintenance requirement records.
     1.5.7. G019C, MISTR Requirements Scheduling and Analysis System, receive interface with the
     most current USP and EIDPSH. G019C provides maintenance with scheduling and analysis data on
     Management Items Subject to Repair (MISTR) repairable items. It schedules and tracks MISTR items
     and provides management information necessary to respond to the turn around required by the repair
     cycle. This system also produces MISTR schedules that are distributed to maintenance for scheduling
     repair operations by individual stock number and control number.
     1.5.8. Q310, Air Force Knowledge System (AFKS), designed to consolidate and centralize data from
     the Air Force's nearly two dozen Combat Support divisions. AFKS has integrated data from nearly 30
     different legacy systems. It pulls in data from domains including maintenance, supplies, finance, con-
     tracts and acquisitions and is currently working on integrating data from the civil engineering and
     training division. The data depot environment provides decision makers an authoritative source of
     data and uses business integration tools for end users to get the data.
     1.5.9. G072D/G072I, receive interface to update the USP and EIDPSH fields of the MP&E database
     with data from the G072D (DMAG Funds) and G072I (Direct Cite Funds) input files. These files
     include only information about contract and inter service (i.e. Army and Navy) requirements.
        1.5.9.1. G072D/G072I’s NSN, WPC, SCN, and Fiscal Year are compared to NSN requirements in
        the MP&E database. If no match is found, the G072D/I record is suspended and MP&E will send
        an alert message. The alert message will state, “No match found for NSN (%s), PSEUDO Code
        (%s), and Fiscal Year (%s). The record will not be processed.
            1.5.9.1.1. If the G072D/I record is not suspended, the EIDPSH and USP is used to update the
            matching MP&E requirement. Also, the USP Source of these MP&E requirements is updated
            with an asterisk (*) to indicate that the source is an interface. It is common in the G072D/I
            interface file for MP&E to receive multiple records for the same NSN, WPC, SCN, and Fiscal
            Year combination due to multiple CLINS on the same SCN.
            1.5.9.1.2. MP&E does not store contract-repaired requirements at the CLIN level; only the
            SCN level. As a result, MP&E will use a weighted average of the USP and EIDPSH for that
            SCN.
     1.5.10. Monthly, the G004C, Workload Programming, Planning, and Control System, provides the
     MP&E system with planned labor application (PLA), direct product actual hours (DPAH), and direct
     product standard hours (DPSH)
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                       15


       1.5.10.1. Monthly 4L, organic PO register data provides the MP&E system with PO data on
       organic quantity, hours, and dollars completed.

1.6. Financial Resources. The following system currently interfaces with MP&E in providing informa-
tion impacting management of financial resources:
   1.6.1. DDSS, DMAPS Data Store System provides DMAG organic project order register data at PCN
   level. This information provides production progress within DMAG ALC organic production facili-
   ties and is used in various MP&E products.

                       DATABASE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS AND ACTIVITIES

2.1. General. Enter file maintenance for repair requests through Oracle-based MP&E system software
and is accessible through a personal computer (PC). Contact your local MP&E FSA for additional infor-
mation.

2.2. Database Support Functions.
     2.2.1. MP&E Core. This is the live system in which file-maintenance occurs.
     2.2.2. IDF (IDF) Core. The Information Delivery Facility (IDF) uses Oracle Discoverer to provide
     users with the ability to view MP&E data, analyze the information, and create customized reports. The
     IDF is updated several times during the day with data from the live database.
     2.2.3. Posture Planning (ppidf). The Posture Planning database is a “snap-shot in time” of the data in
     MP&E. Users are given a suspense date to “scrub” their data and that data is then copied to the Posture
     Planning database. The FSA then has a limited time to verify the data and make any changes at the
     PCN level. The CSA file maintains the inflation factors. On a designated date, established after all
     inputs are accounted for, a file is run to apply the inflation factors. This file then becomes the baseline
     for Workload Review and Posture Planning, and is used by CORE and BRAC. Posture Planning is an
     annual requirement.
     2.2.4. Distribution of Depot Maintenance Workload (50-50) and Workload Certification (xp_idf).
     Before a new Posture Planning IDF file is created, the existing one is copied to another file and
     becomes the XP_IDF. This file becomes the baseline for 50/50 requirements and Workload Certifica-
     tions. These are the requirements that are in the approved President’s Budget for the year of execution.
     Realizing requirements change from budget year to the year of execution, the Workload Certification
     process was established. Increases to exchangeable workload coded as contract repair require Work-
     load Certification Approval.
        2.2.4.1. ALCs use the Workload Review Process to size depot maintenance workload based on
        identified customer funding projections. The funding, hours, manpower, and capabilities identi-
        fied during this process form the baseline for the DMAG Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).
        It is also the basis for DMAG budget and sales rate development and the AFMC organic DMAG
        manpower program
            2.2.4.1.1. Requirements Determination. Various review boards are held for aircraft, engines,
            spare parts, communications/electronics, and software, etc.
     2.2.5. Pre/Post IDF (PR_IDF). These IDFs are run in association with the yearly Logistics Support
     Reviews (LSR). The Pre-review is a copy of the production IDF before the aircraft and missile RPMs
     begin their data scrub. The Post-review is a copy of the production IDF after completion of the LSRs
     and all core data is updated. These are updated prior to the LSRs for the Pre-review and again after the
     LSRs for the Post-review IDF.
     2.2.6. FY Slide (FYSD_IDF). This is a copy of the production IDF that is taken just prior to running
     the MPGEN 13A, which initiates the Fiscal Year Slide. The March Comp data must, unless overcome
     by events, be received in conjunction with the scheduled time, so database will reflect that data. This
     is to be updated the last week of September at the end of September each year.
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                                17


   2.2.7. CAT (IDF_CAT). The Customer Acceptance Test (CAT) IDF is a copy of the production IDF
   that is exported and uploaded to the CAT platform. This is updated prior to testing new versions, and
   the idf_cat is also used to support training.
   2.2.8. MP_OC1 used for testing and training purposes at Tinker
   2.2.9. MP_OO1 used for testing and training purposes at Hill
   2.2.10. MP_WR1 used for testing and training purposes at Warner Robins
   2.2.11. MP_AMARC used for testing and training purposes at AMARC

2.3. MP&E System Problems. System discrepancy reports (DRs) and baseline change requests (BCRs),
jointly called Problem Reports (PRs), will be reported in the Problem Tracking System (PTS) module of
the Information Systems Management Tool (ISMT). The CSA will review all submitted PRs and autho-
rize any further processing. The CSA will prioritize PRs with the input of FSAs or the FRB. CSA and
FSAs should have ISMT accounts. ISMT administrators will coordinate with FSAs concerning other
accounts requested from their sites. Only account holders can submit PRs, users without an account will
work through their FSA. ISMT can be accessed at https://www.ismt.wpafb.af.mil/. To obtain an ISMT
account, follow the instructions in ISMT or contact the MP&E Project Management Office.

2.4. Community of Practice. The MP&E Community of Practice (CoP) can be accessed through the Air
Force Portal, visit URL: https://rso.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/openCoP.asp?Fil-
ter=OO-AQ-MS-01 (a Portal account is required). Anyone with access can view the content of the CoP,
and members of the CoP have additional usage rights (i.e. uploading data). Please follow instructions
posted on the webpage to become a member. CoP administrators will add members after consulting with
the CSA or the requestor’s site FSA. The CSA or the semi-annual FRB will make decisions concerning
major re-structuring of the CoP, assignment of folders for adding data, and restricting access for
non-members.

2.5. Functional Review Board. This board is chaired by HQ AFMC CSA and is conducted semi-annu-
ally. Membership consists of ALC FSAs, 754 ELSG, and Accenture. Discussions will be based on agenda
items submitted by board members to CSA. Topics should be submitted two months prior to the actual
date of the FRB.

2.6. Conference Calls/Ad-Hoc. All bi-monthly conference calls are setup in advance by 754 ELSG, and
calls usually take place on Wednesday, 1430 EST. 754 ELSG will provide, via email, discussion topics
and a meet-me number for all participants to call. All participants are required to call in unless otherwise
indicated in the email.

2.7. Calendar of Events. The annual calendar of events is posted on the MP&E CoP (https://
rso.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/openCoP.asp?Filter=OO-AQ-MS-01). All dates are coordinated
and confirmed at the semi-annual Functional Review Board. Events included on the calendar are those
affected by other major programs such as the LSR, MRRB, ABCS Quarterly Comp Cycles, FY slide,
Routine Block Releases, etc. Anyone can submit a calendar event by going to the month and clicking on
the “+” on the day desired. Submitted events will be placed on the calendar by CoP administrators after
coordinating with the CSA.

2.8. Database Connectivity Procedures. Access requests for ALC MP&E OPRs are accomplished by
completing DD Form 2875. Access requests must be routed through your onsite FSA for approval. Upon
approval/concurrence, the FSA will forward the submission to Oklahoma DISA Security Office. Monthly
access is required to maintain account privileges. Accounts not accessed for a period greater than 90 days
must have their passwords reset and depending on local DISA policy, may require a new DD Form 2875.

2.9. Procedures for Adding Your Printer to DISA Server. For print capabilities, please call in a trou-
ble ticket with your local PC support. Subsequently, local PC support will contact 72nd CS and provide
them with applicable information, (i.e. customer’s email address, bldg. suite (post location) of printer,
printer I.P address, and make/model of printer). Thereafter, 72nd CS will coordinate with DISA OKC and
establish print capabilities.

2.10. Navigational Training. See Maintenance Planning and Execution (MP&E) Student Training
Course Guide (MTELOG-0003400SU) for instructions. This guide provides detailed “navigational”
instructions for navigating through the various MP&E menus and windows. It does not provide the user
with specific workload information to perform their job. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of this manual provide
specific procedures for file maintenance and other activities in MP&E.

2.11. DISA Help Desk Basic Services. DISA, OC-ALC operates the systems management center
(SMC) Help Desk. This service is provided around the clock, 24/7 and support includes:
     2.11.1. Receive call from users and establish a trouble ticket.
     2.11.2. Perform analysis to determine origin of the problem.
     2.11.3. Maintain a database of all trouble tickets and track problems through resolution.

2.12. DD2875 Policy for Reassigning User-id/Passwords. The table below provides information on for
problems associated with if user accounts (i.e. suspension, deactivation, etc.).

                           RPM FILE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES

3.1. Purpose. To provide detailed instructions on processing long-range requirements for each ALC hav-
ing responsibility for managing DLM programs. The RPM is responsible for file maintaining manually
computed DLM requirements in MP&E. This includes all depot maintenance inter-service support agree-
ments (DMISA) and Project Directive (PD) workloads for all DMAG customers. These requirements are
identified by customers, MAJCOMS, and associated application.

3.2. General. This chapter provides guidance on the process and procedures for establishing a PCN,
assignment of the PCN by the FSA, RPM verification of PCN assignment through Alert messages, and
adding your PCN in the requirements maintenance portion of MP&E. Once workload has been estab-
lished in MP&E, you will have the choice of file maintaining it in either MP&E or ABCS, depending on
the RGC. All corrections required as a result of user direct input or system interface will be made by the
RPM in MP&E or the PMS who entered the data in ABCS. Corrections must be made in the source sys-
tem (i.e. original system in which the data was entered).

3.3. Table 3.1. displays the available menus and icons assigned to all regular MP&E users. Areas high-
lighted in gray are reserved for the FSA or CSA. This chapter describes those Menu Icons in white and
procedures required for RPMs to ensure database integrity.

3.4. Requesting a New Program Control Number (PCN). The RPM will establish a new PCN when
an initial requirement for a new workload is requested. The following procedures apply:
     3.4.1. Using the MP&E Thin Client, log into the system. This should prompt the Main Menu window.
         3.4.1.1. Select Program Maintenance on the Main Menu.
         3.4.1.2. Select Pseudo Code Maintenance on the Program Maintenance Menu.
         3.4.1.3. Select the Add option on the Pseudo Code selection window.
         3.4.1.4. Refer to the attachments for guidance on selecting the appropriate criteria for workload.
         The attachments in this manual appear in the same order as the drop down menus on the pseudo
         code detail window.
         3.4.1.5. Enter or select or select data fields from each drop down menu or item that appears on the
         screen, this should be highlighted in yellow. Selection of the RGC will highlight, in yellow, all
         other fields requiring data input. MP&E is designed for users to select valid acceptable entries
         only. Blocks requiring entries not containing a drop down menu can be found in the attachments
         of this manual.
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                                  21


       3.4.1.6. The Element of Expense/Investment Code (EEIC) block will turn yellow once a SOR is
       selected. After you have completed all required data field entries your “OK” button will enable.
       The entry is now ready to submit your request for a PCN. Click the OK button. A message will
       appear on the bottom of your screen indicating “update successful”. You may close out of the pro-
       gram at this point.

3.5. PCN Assignment. The FSA will assign the PSEUDO Code, which establishes the PCN record in
MP&E.

3.6. Alert List. This icon will prompt the Alert Message window and allows the user to inquire on a vari-
ety of alerts. Users must learn to distinguish between message “alerts” and “errors.” As a rule, an alert will
not require action on the RPMs part. It is a system update notifying the RPM of actions recently modified
in the system by either the user or FSA. For example, when a user submits a request for a PCN, an alert
will appear under their RPM code indicating a “Pseudo code has been created.” Once the FSA has
assigned the PCN, the RPM will receive a new alert message indicating a “Pseudo code has been
assigned.” The first alert message requires no action by the RPM and may be deleted if desired. The sec-
ond alert message is not an error, but does require immediate action from the RPM to begin file mainte-
nance for that particular PCN. See Figure 3.1. below.
   3.6.1. Reviewing Alert Messages Received by the RPM. RPMs should review Alert Messages
   each time MP&E is accessed to ensure database integrity. Selecting the designated RPM code from
   the drop down box under “Received By” selecting the “Fill” button, should prompt a window with all
   messages linked to that RPM code. Messages will continue to populate/add-on unless the RPM takes
   appropriate action to clear them. File maintenance on alert messages is an open capability and thus
   can be accomplished at anytime. Also, alert messages will continue to reappear until appropriate
   action is taken to address the message, simple deletions will not fix the message prompts.
   3.6.2. Alert Message Data Elements. Queries can be retrieved by selecting specific data elements
   and data elements may be used individually or in a group. For example, select MPD075_4 if all mes-
   sages are to be reviewed from part 4 of the D075 interface, refer to Figure 3.2. for additional guid-
   ance. Note the Message Category will contain, “Invalid Pseudo Code Data” and additional detailed
   information will be displayed in the “Message Data” window indicating: “Pseudo Code (D000/E000/
   J000) not established in D363. The following record will not be processed. Record
   1420-00-000-4543 AH.” This type of alert is considered an “error” message. The error indicates that
   file maintenance was accomplished in ABCS for a specific stock number using an invalid or dummy
   pseudo code (UJ0000). MP&E did not accept the NSN file maintenance data. Corrective action
   requires the MM/PMS to file maintain NSN 142000004543AH in ABCS using a valid PCN. This
   change and corrective action will reflect in MP&E after next scheduled D075 interface.

3.7. RPM File Maintenance. The RPM will file maintain requirements to include current FY and seven
out years in MP&E, or in the applicable interface systems, D075 and/or D101.
   3.7.1. RGC A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, and 1 requirement are file maintained in
   MP&E. Refer to Attachment 1 for a description of each RGC code.
   3.7.2. RGC J and K (at the NSN level) requirements are file-maintained in D075. In the case an NSN
   did not get file maintained in D075 or failed to come over in the D075 interface, the MM/PMS may
   file maintain that NSN directly into MP&E. The source of the requirement will show MP&E. Along
22                                                                  AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007


     those lines, if the NSN gets into the following D075/ABCS computation and overlays correctly into
     MP&E, then it will over ride the requirement that was file maintained directly into MP&E from the
     previous computation and the source of requirement will change from MP&E to D075. RGC K will be
     file maintained in MP&E at the PCN level.
     3.7.3. RGC J and K (at the NSN level) requirements are file-maintained in D075. . RGC K will be file
     maintained in MP&E at the PCN level.
     3.7.4. RGC G and H, applicable to WR-ALC only, vehicle requirements are file maintained in D101
     and sent to MP&E. All other RGC G and H (OMEI) requirements are file maintained directly into
     MP&E.
     3.7.5. If the requirement pertains to a Mission Design/Mission Design Series RGC A, B, C, D or Type
     Model/Type Model Series RGC E and F the MP&E FSA must ensure that the weapon system is iden-
     tified in the weapon system table prior to assigning a PCN.
     3.7.6. If the NSN RGC J or K is a new requirement in D075/ABCS, then it must file maintained to a
     PCN/SCN. If it fails to get assigned to a valid PCN/SCN or it gets file maintained to a wrong or erro-
     neous PCN/SCN in D075/ABCS then it will appear in MP&E Alert Messages, reference Attachment
     20, for corrective action by the RPM. The RPM must then take action to assign the NSN to a valid
     PCN/SCN in MP&E and should try to get the NSN assigned prior to the end of the file maintenance
     period of the current D075/ABCS computation cycle.
     3.7.7. If a DLM workload is designated for more than one SOR, then a separate PCN must be estab-
     lished and file maintained for each SOR, refer to Attachment 5 for SOR codes. Also, there should be
     a corresponding number of requirement records maintained, if more than one PCN is required to iden-
     tify workloads.

                                       AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES

4.1. Introduction to Aircraft and Missiles. The purpose of the aircraft and missile data is to identify
aircraft and missile depot level maintenance, permanent modification requirements, and programs on all
major customer supported weapon systems and equipment. Requirements are reflected in the system by
the driving record. The driving record reflects the reason the aircraft or missile is in depot status, i.e. Pro-
grammed Depot Maintenance (PDM), Depot Field Team (DFT), etc. Modifications accomplished concur-
rently with the driving tasks are reflected on associated records. Also, certain maintenance tasks
performed during PDM are broken out from the driving record and are reflected on associated records.

4.2. Data Sources. The RPM directly inputs the data in the MP&E system. The RPM uses several
sources to obtain information for input, including:
   4.2.1. Maintenance Requirements Review Board (MRRB). The MRRB is held annually to validate
   and approve the Direct Product Standard Hours (DPSH) required for each PDM task. The DPSH
   file-maintained in MP&E must reflect MRRB approved hours. Occasionally, there are Out-of-Cycle
   requests presented to the MRRB for changes; once these changes have been approved by the MRRB,
   they can be file-maintained to MP&E.
   4.2.2. Configuration Control Board (CCB) approval. The CCB approves modifications to weapon
   systems. Modification numbers are assigned by the CCB.
   4.2.3. Budget Exhibit P3A, Modification of Aircraft. The P3A is the Central Procurement budget
   document used for modifications. Only depot-level modification installs are file-maintained to
   MP&E. P3As are located in the Integrated Budget Documentation and Execution System (IDECS).
   Once a depot-level P3A has been established, the install requirements should be file-maintained to
   MP&E.
   4.2.4. T.O. 00-25-04, Depot Maintenance of Aerospace Vehicular and Training Equipment. This T.O.
   provides procedures for programmed maintenance.
   4.2.5. T.O. 00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance. This T.O. provides procedures for un-programmed
   maintenance.
   4.2.6. Maintenance Engineering Document (Aircraft Flying Hour and Inventory Report). This docu-
   ment is provided by HQ USAF and provides the quantity of aircraft by MD.
   4.2.7. Sales Rates and Prices for the Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG) of the Air Force
   Working Capital Fund (AFWCF). Yearly sales rates and prices are provided by HQ AFMC/FMR.
   4.2.8. Financial Management Handbook. The Financial Management Handbook can be found at the
   following link: https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/FM/FMRS/index.htm, chapter 92
   of the handbook covers the DPEM process.
   4.2.9. Other sources as required by HQ USAF and/or customers.

4.3. PCN Structure for Aircraft and Missiles. An aircraft or missile PCN is limited in scope to a single
type aircraft or missile (normally the MDS), a single type of work, and a single customer. The work must
also be in the same RGC, agency, and facility. Work on aircraft belonging to several commands may be
26                                                                    AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007


reported on the same PCN, if there is a single funding source. Work being funded by different customers
must be reported against separate PCNs.
     4.3.1. PDM and ACI. PDM and ACI requirements are shown under RGC A for aircraft and RGC C
     for missiles. These requirements are scheduled on a calendar/time cycle basis and are presented to the
     MRRB for approval. Aircraft and missiles receiving the same type work may be reported on the same
     PCN if they have the same MDS, customer code, RGC, agency, and facility. The Program Code must
     be at the MD level; the sub-program code must be at the MDS level. Applicable PUCs are N000A for
     PDMs, and F0082 for ACIs. If ACIs are being accomplished in conjunction with PDMs, the PDM
     PUC of N000A is used and ACI is shown as an associated record.
     4.3.2. Depot Maintenance. When depot maintenance is done on aircraft or missiles that are not on a
     PDM schedule, there are several PUCs that can be used, such as: K000A - Depot Maintenance – non
     PDM, F0100 - drop-in maintenance, F0180 - fly-in maintenance or H000A - repair. The Program
     Code must be at the MD level; the sub-program code must be at the MDS level. If the workload is
     recurring and can be forecast with analysis of Air Force programming documents, the requirements
     are shown under RGC A or C. If not, the RGC is B or D.
     4.3.3. Field Teams. Maintenance accomplished by field teams is considered un-programmed and
     therefore is accomplished under RGC B for aircraft and RGC D for missiles. If work that is normally
     performed in a depot facility under RGC A is accomplished with a field team, it is reported under
     RGC B. The Program Code must be at the MD level; the sub-program code must be at the MDS level.
     4.3.4. Contingencies. Since it is impossible to project specific un-programmed requirements, contin-
     gency PCNs are established to cover un-programmed requirements. A PCN is established for each
     Major Command. The Program Code and the Sub-Program Code are at the MD level. There are two
     types of contingencies:
        4.3.4.1. Depot Repair. A contingency PCN should be set up for each Major Command for 107
        requests (submitted according to TO-00-25-107). The depot repair contingency PCN should be set
        up with a RGC of B and with a PUC of H000A.
        4.3.4.2. Aircraft Damage Repair (ADR). Damage that is not due to fair wear and tear and exceeds
        $250,000 is considered aircraft damage repair. The ADR contingency PCN should be set up with
        a RGC of B and a PUC of F0188.
     4.3.5. Modifications Installs. Only permanent, approved depot-level modifications are file-main-
     tained in MP&E. A separate PCN should be established for each mod number, facility, and agency.
     The Program Code should be at the MD level. If the modification pertains to more than one MDS, the
     Sub-Program Code should be established at the MD level. Modifications installed during PDM or as
     a Fly-In Program should be set up with an RGC of A. Modifications installed by a field team should
     be set up with an RGC of B. All modifications will have a PUC of C000C.
     4.3.6. Modification Processing. If an aircraft or missile comes into the depot for modifications only,
     a modification processing PCN must be established. The Program and Sub-Program Codes should be
     at the MD level. These PCNs will have a PUC of D000B. The customer who funds the driving work-
     load generally pays for aircraft processing. If an aircraft or missile comes into the depot for modifica-
     tions only, BP11/21 pays for the processing costs. Processing consists of fueling and de-fueling,
     towing, panel removal and all preparation required on the units to be modified. If an aircraft or missile
     comes in for both modification and maintenance, BP11/21 will only pay for processing that is peculiar
     to the modifications’ installation.
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                                 27


   4.3.7. Modification Fly-In Programs. When a modification is the driver for the aircraft/missile
   coming into the depot, a PCN should be set up for each Major Command to cover Category II/III
   repairs. The PCN should be set up with a PUC of G000D (concurrent repair). Categories of repair in
   relation to modification fly-in programs are as follows:
       4.3.7.1. Category I: Maintenance deficiencies that must be corrected in order to complete the
       installation and checkout of the modification per the TCTO. These discrepancies include deficien-
       cies found in disturbed systems as well as deficiencies found in systems/equipment that were not
       disturbed by the modification, but are required to perform the after-modification checkout. The
       labor and material required to correct these deficiencies are funded by the modification (BP11/21).
       4.3.7.2. Category II: Maintenance “Safety of Flight” deficiencies which do not fall under Cat I,
       but which must be corrected in order to return the aircraft to the user. The labor and material
       required to correct these deficiencies are funded by the customer’s DPEM funds.
       4.3.7.3. Category III: Maintenance deficiencies which do not fall under Cat II or which the user
       has directed be repaired by the depot. The labor and material required to correct these deficiencies
       are funded by the customer’s DPEM funds.

4.4. Tables. In the aircraft and missile portion of MP&E, there are several table areas that can or must be
used to propagate records in the system.
   4.4.1. Modification Numbers. Modifications numbers must be added to the system before they can
   be associated with a pseudo request. The modification number must be tied to a Repair Item Identifier
   (RIID). A modification description is required; comments are optional. Detailed instructions for add-
   ing, changing, or deleting modification numbers are provided in the MP&E Training Manual.
   4.4.2. Applications. The application field is a description of the task being performed (i.e. strip paint,
   ACI, Negotiated O&I) and is used to differentiate repair records. The application must be file main-
   tained to the table before it can be used on driving and associated records. Adding an application to the
   table will cause the application name to appear in the drop-down combo box on the application field.
   The application must be tied to a RIID and a print order must be assigned. The print order is used for
   printing reports, and is designed to sort/print reports the same order for all PCNs tied to the applicable
   RIID. Assigning applications to the different tasks allows use of the standards tables, which allows the
   user to make mass changes for hours and Unit Sales Prices (USPs). If an application is not assigned,
   the system will assign “Record01” “Record02”, etc. Users should use “Record01”, “Record02,” etc.
   only on modification association records. Maintenance tasks should be assigned an application name
   that is descriptive of the task being performed. Once an application is assigned, it cannot be changed.
   The record will have to be deleted and input again. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying, or
   deleting applications are provided in the MP&E Training Manual.
   4.4.3. Aircraft and Missile Requirement Standards. In the Aircraft & Missile Requirements Stan-
   dards portion of MP&E, the users have the option to set up and use standards tables in order to make
   mass changes to their requirements. A batch module will propagate the requirement standards to the
   most specific repair program match that is not marked as an override. The batch modules run nightly,
   meaning that updates to the tables will take effect the following day. Detailed instructions for adding,
   modifying, or deleting standards are provided in the MP&E Training Manual. The following para-
   graphs describe each type of standard:
28                                                                    AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007


       4.4.3.1. Flow Days. Flow days can be mass changed using a standard. Flow days are the average
       number of days an aircraft is in depot status for a specified type of work. It is important that flow
       days are correctly file-maintained since they are used by the system to compute out-put schedules.
       The RIID, Facility Location ID, PUC and Flow Days fields are mandatory, the Comments field is
       optional. The system default for Flow Days is “one.”
       4.4.3.2. Hourly Rate. The hourly sales rate can be mass changed using a standard. Approved
       organic sales rates are provided by HQ AFMC. The RIID, Facility Location ID, Agency, RGC,
       and eight Fiscal Years of Hourly Rate fields are mandatory. The Reason and Comments fields are
       optional.
       4.4.3.3. Maintenance End Item Direct Product Standard Hour (EIDPSH). The Maintenance
       EIDPSH can be mass changed using a standard. The EIDPSH is obtained from the MRRB Bro-
       chure for programmed organic workloads. The RIID, Facility Location ID, PUC, and eight fiscal
       years of EIDPSH data are mandatory. The Application field is enabled, but limited based on the
       RIID entered. The Reason and Comments fields are optional.
       4.4.3.4. Maintenance Unit Sales Price (USP). The Maintenance USP can be mass changed using
       a standard. The maintenance USP pertains to contract workloads and is obtained from the seller
       PMS. The RIID, Facility Location ID, PUC, and eight fiscal years of USP data are mandatory. The
       Application field is enabled, but limited based on the RIID entered. The Reason and Comments
       fields are optional.
       4.4.3.5. Modification EIDPSH. The Modification EIDPSH can be mass changed using a standard.
       The Modification EIDPSH is the number of hours it takes to install a modification and can be
       obtained from the modification manager. The RIID, Facility Location ID, Modification Number,
       and eight fiscal years of Modification EIDPSH data are mandatory. The Reason and Comment
       fields are optional.
       4.4.3.6. Modification USP. The Modification USP can be mass changed using a standard. The
       maintenance USP pertains to contract workloads and is obtained from the seller PMS. The RIID,
       Facility Location ID, Modification Number, and eight fiscal years of Modification USP data are
       mandatory. The Reason and Comment fields are optional.
       4.4.3.7. PDM Cycle. The PDM Cycle can be mass changed using a standard. The PDM Cycle is
       the number of months between PDMs. The RIID and PDM Cycle fields are mandatory, the Com-
       ments field is optional.

4.5. Driving Records. Aircraft and missiles requirements are reflected in the system by the driving
record. Driving records report eight years of approved data on depot maintenance programs and eight
years of proposed data, beginning with the current year. The user file-maintains changes/updates to the
requirements to the proposed data. The proposed data is reviewed and validated by the MAJCOMs during
the annual Logistics Support Review. After the review, the validated requirements are copied to the
approved line. This line remains static until the next review. The system defaults to the proposed require-
ments and the approved requirements may be viewed by selecting the Approved button in the Reviewed
Status box. The driving record reflects the task that is causing the aircraft or missile to be in depot status.
If the aircraft or missile is scheduled into depot exclusively for modification, the driving record will only
show the data for processing the aircraft or missile through the depot. In the case of field teams, there may
not be processing charges. In those cases, the driving record will only reflect the quantity of aircraft that
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                                29


are in depot status. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying, or deleting a driving record can be found
in the MP&E Training Manual. The following screens are used to file-maintain driving records:
   4.5.1. Aircraft and Missile Requirement Detail Screen. The Aircraft and Missile Requirement
   Detail screen reflects PCN data from the Pseudo Requirements Area, total quantity, hourly sales rate,
   EIDPSH, USP, Total Hours and Total Dollars by FY for the driving record, and a list box containing
   the Associated Records. The data carried over from the Pseudo Requirement area is protected except
   for the Comments field, the Suppression Status field, the RPM field, and the Application field. The
   RIID is the Sub-Program Code from the Pseudo Requirement area.
       4.5.1.1. Comments Field. The comments field is a free field. Information entered in this field will
       print out on the J-reports.
       4.5.1.2. Suppression Status Field. The Suppression Status will indicate an active versus sup-
       pressed requirement. Suppressed requirements will not print on the J-reports and will not be
       reflected in the IDF. To suppress a driving record, the carryover and proposed requirements for the
       current fiscal year must be zero.
       4.5.1.3. RPM Field. The RPM field will reflect the RPM code of the RPM that established the
       PCN. However, the RPM may be changed when the record is established.
       4.5.1.4. Application Field. A drop-down combo box is activated on this field that reflects the
       entries in the Application Table for the applicable MD/MDS, this field may be blank on driving
       records.
   4.5.2. Aircraft and Missile Requirement Schedule Screen. Selecting the “Schedule” button on the
   Aircraft and Missile Requirement Detail Screen will prompt the Aircraft and Missile Requirement
   Schedule screen. Repair quantities are file-maintained by quarter. Only the scheduled in quantity is
   file-maintained; the scheduled out quantity is computed by the system based on the number of flow
   days. If a quantity is changed and there is a higher quantity on the corresponding quarter of an associ-
   ated record, the system will automatically change the quantity of the associated record and the RPM
   will receive a message on the screen notifying them of the change.
       4.5.2.1. Flow Days. Flow days are the average number of days an aircraft is in depot status for a
       specified type of work. The flow days are file-maintained on the driving record and apply to all the
       associated records on the driving record. The flow days are reflective of the number of days it
       takes to complete the driving task and all associated tasks. If a maintenance task or modification is
       added to the workload package that increases the amount of time the aircraft or missile is in depot,
       the flow days must be changed accordingly. Flow days can be derived from a standard table. If the
       standard does not apply, the flow days can be overridden by selecting the Flow Days override box.
       The correct flow days can then be file-maintained.
       4.5.2.2. PDM Cycle. The PDM Cycle is the number of months between scheduled PDMs. The
       PDM Cycle can be derived from a standard table. If the standard does not apply, the PDM Cycle
       can be overridden by selecting the PDM Cycle override box. The correct PDM Cycle can then be
       file maintained.
       4.5.2.3. Carryover. The carryover quantity may be updated within the first year of the schedule.
       Upon the execution of the FY slide, the carryover will be calculated and protected from user
       update. The carryover reflects the quantity of aircraft or missiles that were inducted in the previ-
       ous FY, but have not yet been completed.
30                                                                  AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007


     4.5.3. Aircraft and Missile Requirement Hours and Dollars Screen. The Aircraft and Missile
     Requirement Hours and Dollars screen reflects the Quantity, Hourly Rate, EIDPSH, USP, Total
     Hours, and Total Dollars for each FY. The Quantity is the Total FY Quantity computed from the
     schedule screen. For organic workloads, the Hourly Rate, and EIDPSH are file-maintained. The USP,
     Total Hours, and Total Dollars are computed by the system. For contract workloads, the EIDPSH, and
     USP are file-maintained. The Hourly Rate is left blank. The Total Hours and Total Dollars are com-
     puted by the system. An organic record has an agency code of D (organic depot) or S (depot team), or
     an agency code of U (unknown) and an ALC facility code. All other agency codes are considered con-
     tract. The Hourly Rate, Maintenance EIDPSH, and Maintenance USP can be derived from a standard
     table. If the standard does not apply, it can be overridden by selecting the appropriate override box.
     The correct Hourly Rate, Maintenance EIDPSH, or Maintenance USP can then be file-maintained.
     Also, a reason may be selected from the Hourly Rate Reason, EIDPSH Reason, or USP Reason drop-
     down combo boxes to explain changes.

4.6. Associated Records. Modifications accomplished concurrently with the driving tasks are reflected
on associated records. Also, certain maintenance tasks performed during PDM are broken out from the
driving record and reflected on associated records. Generally, paint requirements, Negotiated O&I, ACI
and special interest items, such as large one-time through the fleet tasks or any other tasks the MAJCOMs
may request to see separately, are broken out and reflected on associated records. Associated records are
listed in the Associated Requirements list box on the Aircraft and Missile Requirement Detail screen of
the driving record. Associated records contain and report eight years of approved data on depot mainte-
nance programs and eight years of proposed data, beginning with the current year. The system defaults to
the proposed requirements; the approved requirements may be viewed by selecting the Approved button
in the Reviewed Status box. Associated records must be file-maintained at the MDS level. Detailed
instructions for adding, modifying, or deleting an associated record can be found in the MP&E Training
Manual. The following screens are used to file-maintain associated records:
     4.6.1. Aircraft and Missile Requirement Detail Screen. The Aircraft and Missile Requirement
     Detail screen reflects PCN data from the Pseudo Requirements Area; the total quantity, hourly sales
     rate, End Item Direct Product Standard Hours (EIDPSH), Unit Sales Price (USP), Total Hours and
     Total Dollars by FY for the associate record. The data carried over from the Pseudo Requirement area
     is protected except for the Comments field, the Suppression Status field, the RPM field and the Appli-
     cation field. The RIID is the Sub-Program Code from the Pseudo Requirement area.
        4.6.1.1. Comments Field. The comments field is a open field, information entered in this field will
        print out on the J-reports.
        4.6.1.2. Suppression Status Field. The Suppression Status will indicate an active versus sup-
        pressed requirement. Suppressed requirements will not print on the J-reports and will not be
        reflected in the IDF. To suppress a driving record, the carryover and proposed requirements for the
        current fiscal year must be zero.
        4.6.1.3. RPM Field. The RPM field will reflect the RPM code of the RPM that established the
        PCN. However, the RPM may be changed when the record is established.
        4.6.1.4. Application Field. A drop-down combo box is activated on this field that reflects the
        entries in the Application Table for the applicable MD/MDS. An application name must be
        file-maintained to the Application Table before it is available in the drop-down menu. The system
        defaults to “Record01,” “Record02,” etc., if an entry is not made in the Application Table. Users
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                                 31


       should not rely on the system to assign application names for non-modification tasks; they should
       assign an application that is descriptive of the task being performed. Once an application is
       assigned, it cannot be changed. The record will have to be deleted and added back. An entry must
       be selected since the Application Field is used to differentiate the associated records.
   4.6.2. Aircraft and Missile Requirement Schedule Screen. Selecting the “Schedule” button on the
   Aircraft and Missile Requirement Detail Screen will bring up the Aircraft and Missile Requirement
   Schedule screen. Repair quantities are file-maintained by quarter. Only the scheduled in quantity is
   file-maintained; the scheduled out quantity is computed by the system based on the number of flow
   days. The schedule may be copied from the driving record. A quantity may not be file-maintained that
   is higher than the quantity on the corresponding quarter of the driving record.
   4.6.3. Aircraft and Missile Requirement Hours and Dollars Screen. The Aircraft and Missile
   Requirement Hours and Dollars screen reflect the Quantity, Hourly Rate, EIDPSH, USP, Total Hours,
   and Total Dollars for each FY. The Quantity is the Total FY Quantity computed from the schedule
   screen. For organic workloads, the Hourly Rate and EIDPSH are file-maintained. The USP, Total
   Hours and Total Dollars are computed by the system. For contract workloads, the EIDPSH and USP
   are file-maintained. The Hourly Rate is left blank. The Total Hours and Total Dollars are computed by
   the system. An organic record has an agency code of D (organic depot) or S (depot team), or an
   agency code of U (unknown) and an ALC facility code. All other agency codes are considered con-
   tract. The Hourly Rate, Maintenance EIDPSH, and Maintenance USP can be derived from a standard
   table. If the standard does not apply, it can be overridden by selecting the appropriate override box.
   The correct Hourly Rate, Maintenance EIDPSH, or Maintenance USP can then be file-maintained.
   Also, a reason may be selected from the Hourly Rate Reason, EIDPSH Reason, or USP Reason drop-
   down combo boxes to explain changes.

4.7. Modifications. Modifications are file-maintained on associated records; however, there is additional
information that pertains only to modifications. The modification requirement is to reflect an estimate of
the dollars and hours that will be needed to install the modification. Modification installation require-
ments are entered in MP&E as soon as the modification has been approved by the CCB, and the P3A doc-
ument has been approved. Modification numbers are assigned by the Single Manager/Operating CCB
Executive Secretariat. The SPD is responsible for the accuracy of the information that is file maintained.
   4.7.1. Aircraft and Missile Requirement Detail Screen. The information on the Aircraft and Mis-
   sile Requirement Detail Screen is the same for modifications as other associated records except for the
   following:
       4.7.1.1. Repair Item Identifier (RIID). The Program Code and the Sub-Program Code for modifi-
       cation PCNs are established at the MD level. However, the associated requirement records must
       be established at the MDS level. MP&E interfaces modification install schedules to the Applica-
       tions, Programs and Indentures (D200F) system, which requires data at the MDS level. Therefore,
       on associated modification records, the RIID must be changed from the MD to the MDS.
       4.7.1.2. Suppression Status Field. The Suppression Status options for modifications records
       include Active, Suppressed, Completed, and Cancelled. Suppressed, completed, and cancelled
       requirements will not print on the J-reports and will not be reflected in the IDF. To suppress a driv-
       ing record, the carryover and proposed requirements for the current fiscal year must be zero. A
       modification can be completed if the Total Quantity equals the Completed Quantity. The system
       will automatically change a record to complete during the Quarterly-Add-Over if the Total Quan-
32                                                                  AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007


        tity equals the Completed Quantity. A modification can be cancelled if the Total Quantity and
        Completed Quantity equal zero.
        4.7.1.3. Application Field. A drop-down combo box is activated on this field that reflects the
        entries in the Application Table for modifications. An entry must be selected to differentiate the
        associated records. The options are Kit Proof, Trial Installation, Component Modification, Sup-
        port Equipment Modification, Res/Devel/Test/Eval, Bench Mockup, and RECORD**.
        RECORD** must be selected if none of the other options are applicable. The system will keep
        track of the number of modification records associated with a driving record and will offer the
        next number available. For example, the first time a mod record is added to a driving record,
        “RECORD01” will be available, the next time “RECORD02” will be available, etc.
     4.7.2. Aircraft and Missile Requirement Schedule Screen. On the Aircraft and Missile Require-
     ment Schedule screen, there is a Modification box that includes the Total Quantity field, the Quantity
     In Work field, and the Quantity Completed field. These fields are enabled only for those records with
     a PUC of C000C.
        4.7.2.1. Total Quantity. The Total Quantity field reflects the total numbers of modifications that
        that are being installed for this particular workload. The Total Quantity must be greater than or
        equal to the sum of current Quantity in Work, current Quantity Completed, and the remaining pro-
        posed Scheduled Input Quantity.
        4.7.2.2. Quantity in Work. The Quantity in Work field may be updated within the first quarter of
        the first fiscal year on the schedule. Upon the execution of the Quarterly Add-Over, the Quantity
        In Work will be calculated and protected from user update. For each quarter, starting with the next
        quarter to be included in the quarterly add-over, the quantity in work is increased by the quantity
        scheduled in and decreased by the quantity scheduled out.
        4.7.2.3. Quantity Completed. The Quantity Completed field is calculated by the system and is
        protected from user update.
        4.7.2.4. Schedule Errors. The sum of the quantity completed and the quantity scheduled out for
        each quarter not included in a quarterly add-over is computed. If this value does not match the
        quantity programmed, there is a schedule error and the field must be corrected before the record
        can be saved. Also, the sum of the quantity completed, the quantity in work, and the quantity
        scheduled in for each quarter not included in a quarterly add-over is computed. If this sum does
        not match the quantity programmed, there is a schedule error, and the field must be corrected
        before the record can be saved.

4.8. Contingency Maintenance. This term refers to those types of un-programmed tasks that can only be
scheduled after a problem is discovered. If there is a history of repeated occurrence, a contingency projec-
tion PCN is established to estimate the level of expected future requirement. Normally, averaging the dol-
lars obligated over the last three years arrives at the estimate used. When the work actually generates,
money is transferred from the projection PCN to the execution PCN under which the workload will be
funded and accomplished. There are two types of contingencies:
     4.8.1. Depot Repair. 107 requests (submitted according to TO-00-25-107) from the Major Com-
     mands are funded from the depot repair contingency PCN.
     4.8.2. Aircraft Damage Repair (ADR). Damage that is not due to fair wear and tear and exceeds
     $250,000 is considered aircraft damage repair and should be funded from the ADR Contingency PCN.
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                                33


   4.8.3. Contingency Projection Records. Each projection requirement is established as a driving
   PCN and must be reflected at the MD level. A separate PCN must be established for each customer.
   Separate PCNs should also be established for organic, inter-service and contract workloads. If more
   than one organic SOR is involved, use a separate PCN for each. If more than one contract/inter-service
   SOR is involved, use facility code UNK for unknown. Within each, select an agency where the bulk
   of the requirement is expected to be accomplished. Contingency records are designated in the system
   by selecting the contingency indicator. This changes the input screen to reflect the Quantity, Hourly
   Rate, Total Requirements Dollars, Total Execution Dollars, Variance Hours, and Variance Dollars. For
   contract contingencies, only the Total Requirements Dollars are file-maintained; for organic contin-
   gencies, only the Hourly Rate and the Total Requirements Dollars are file-maintained. The Quantity
   and Total Execution Dollars are generated from the execution PCNs. The Variance Dollars are com-
   puted by subtracting the Total Execution Dollars from the Total Requirements Dollars. The Variance
   Hours are computed by dividing the Variance Dollars by the Hourly Rate on organic PCNs. The Vari-
   ance Hours and Dollars are the fields reflected on the J-reports. Detailed instructions for adding, mod-
   ifying or deleting a contingency record are available in the MP&E Training Manual.
   4.8.4. Execution Generation Records. When work projected as a contingency actually generates
   the workload is reported on a driving record at the MDS level. Each unique combination of input des-
   ignation, customer code, RGC, agency, and facility requires a different PCN. The most commonly
   used PUCs for unprogrammed maintenance is PUC F0100 for drop-in maintenance, PUC F0180 for
   fly-in maintenance or PUC H000A for repair. See Attachment 8 for a total list of PUCs. Each execu-
   tion record must be tied to a contingency by file-maintaining the contingency PCN in the Contingency
   Cross- Reference SCN field on the Aircraft and Missile Requirements Detail Screen. Dollars reflected
   on the execution records are subtracted from the contingency projection record. Generated damage
   repair is carried in RGC B. Each damage repair should be scheduled in the earliest year it could be
   work loaded regardless of funding availability, and rescheduled into the next FY no later than Septem-
   ber if it becomes certain that funding will not be provided. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying
   or deleting execution records are available in the MP&E Training Manual.

4.9. Processing of Data.
   4.9.1. Fiscal Year Slide on the Standards. At the beginning of a new FY, it becomes necessary for
   the MP&E system to move forward, by one year, on all FYs. The standards tables will also move for-
   ward by one year on all FYs.
   4.9.2. Quarterly Add-over. On the first day of each quarter, the system repositions the quantity com-
   pleted and the quantity in work on modification records. It adds the proposed quantity scheduled in for
   the quarter just completed to the quantity in work. It then subtracts the proposed quantity scheduled
   out for this quarter from the quantity in work and adds it to the quantity completed. The fourth quarter
   add-over must be run before the FY slide.
   4.9.3. Standards Update. Updates to the standards tables are run nightly in a batch module, meaning
   that updates to the tables will take effect the following day. A batch module will propagate the require-
   ment standards to the most specific repair program match that is not marked as an override. Selecting
   the override option on the Aircraft and Missile Requirement Schedule screen or the Aircraft and Mis-
   sile Hours and Dollars screen will prevent the record from being changed by the standards update.
   4.9.4. Proposed to Approve Roll-Up. At a designated date after the LSR, the post-review will be
   run by DISA. At this time, the information on the proposed line is copied to the approved line. The
34                                                                     AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007


     FSAs then may run the Post-Review J01 reports. The data on the approved line remains static until the
     next post-review, unless changed by the FSA. Only the FSA has the authority to make changes to the
     approved line.

4.10. Aircraft and Missile Reports
     4.10.1. Description and Usage of MP&E Aircraft and Missile Core Reports. The MP&E core
     reports area allows users to print standardized reports from the MP&E application. Reports printed
     from this area will show pre-defined data elements in a pre-defined format for a specified group of
     data. The reports can be filtered and sorted to tailor the report to the user’s specifications. Filtering
     data will narrow down the information to print. Sorting data will organize the filtered data for the
     user’s specific needs. Listed here are the standardized reports available and an explanation of the data
     portrayed.
        4.10.1.1. J01 (Aircraft & Missile Maintenance and Modification Report). The J01 is the most
        used report, it displays the details of the depot maintenance and modifications install projects from
        an ALC. The information is arranged in an orderly fashion, so that whoever is reading it can
        quickly locate the particular information needed. The default sort for the information in the J01 is
        MD/MDS, Customer, RGC, and Pseudo Code. For each PCN, the J01 shows a wealth of informa-
        tion, including the specific work to be done, where it will be done, who will do it, when it will be
        done, how much it will cost per aircraft, the total cost per FY, who owns the aircraft, and who will
        pay for the work being done. The report shows the entire project or program as it was approved by
        the customer, and also shows any adjustments to the program by the program manager, and his
        reason for making them. The J01 divides the information for each PCN into three parts: Part A,
        Depot Maintenance; Part B, Modification Schedule Detail; and Part X, Summary. Part A may be
        divided into two sections in order to show even more detail. Section I shows the primary mainte-
        nance task that caused the aircraft to be input into depot status, and Section II shows any other
        maintenance that will be performed concurrently. Part B shows the installation requirements for an
        approved mod. It must be noted that part B shows only the DPSH and costs for the actual installa-
        tion of the mod kit; the processing costs of bringing the aircraft into the depot are shown in part A,
        Section I. The Cross-Reference PCN field on the Part B record reflects the Part A PCN that has the
        processing costs and quantities of aircraft being driven into the depot. Part X summarizes the data
        in parts A and B.
        4.10.1.2. J03 (Part X). This product is a reprint of the J01 Part X Summary information. Those
        who need program information, but do not require the detail contained in the J01 Part A and Part
        B use this product.
        4.10.1.3. J05 (PCN Cross Reference). This product contains the same information as the J01, only
        in a different sequence. In this report, the Part B modification records are shown with the Part A
        records they are tied to by the Cross-Reference PCN. This allows the user to see the total workload
        projected for an aircraft while it is in depot status. The default sort for the information in the J05 is
        MD/MDS, Customer, RGC, and Pseudo Code.
        4.10.1.4. J07 (Part X Cross Reference). This product is a reprint of the J05 Part X Summary infor-
        mation. Those who need program information, but do not require the detail contained in the J05
        Part A and Part B use this product.
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                               35


       4.10.1.5. J09 (Aircraft & Missile Suppressed/Cancelled Requirements). This report contains all
       records that have been suppressed or cancelled. The default sort is MD/MDS and SCN. This report
       is in the same format as the J01, but includes only the suppressed/cancelled records.
       4.10.1.6. J11 (Aircraft & Missile Modification Number Detail). This report contains all Part B
       records sorted by MD/MDS and Modification Number. The records within MD and Modification
       Number are also sub-totaled by Agency. This product is used to reconcile modification require-
       ments with the P3 documents.
       4.10.1.7. Aircraft & Missile Requirements Standards Reports. In the Aircraft & Missile Require-
       ments Standards portion of the MP&E core, the users have the option to set up and use standards
       tables in order to make mass changes to their requirements. A formatted report may be generated
       from the Aircraft and Missile Requirement Standards Selection window by clicking File/Print
       from the menu bar. All data displayed on the window will be contained in the report, along with
       the corresponding standard value, Reason, and Comments. For requirement standards entered by
       Fiscal Year, eight Fiscal Years of data, starting with the current Fiscal Year, will be printed for
       each standard displayed. A description of each type of standard is provided in paragraph 4.4.3.
       4.10.1.8. Modification Number Report. The Modification Number Maintenance area in the
       MP&E core is used to define modification numbers within MP&E that later can be associated with
       Aircraft & Missile requirements. A Modification Number must be added to the system before it
       can be associated with a pseudo code request. A formatted report may be generated form the Mod-
       ification Number Selection window by clicking File/Print from the menu bar. It will contain the
       RIID, Modification Number, Modification Description, and any Comments.

4.11. Information Delivery Facility (IDF) Reports.
   4.11.1. MPEADEVL.CK01 (Aircraft and Missiles Maintenance and Modification Summaries).
   This IDF report contains four worksheets. The CK01 SCN report reflects aircraft and missile require-
   ments by MD, SOR, RGC and the driving record. It also gives a breakdown of the requirements by the
   associated records and gives a PCN rollup. The CK01 Mod Totals reflect the requirements for mod
   records only. The CK01 Maintenance Totals reflect mod totals only. The CK01 Totals reflect a sum-
   mary of all aircraft and missile requirements by Customer Code.
   4.11.2. MPEADEVL.CK01 (Contingencies). This report provides a list of the contingency PCNs
   and the execution PCNs associated with them. It also reflects the total dollars executed and the contin-
   gency dollars remaining.
   4.11.3. MPEADEVL.CK02. This report provides aircraft and missile summary totals by RGC.
   4.11.4. MPEADEVL.JP01. This report contains two worksheets. JP01-Detail provides a list of air-
   craft and missile requirements by command and SCN. The JP01-Summary summarizes requirements
   by command.

4.12. Logistics Support Review (LSR). The LSR is conducted annually to discuss DPEM aircraft and
missile depot maintenance programs to ensure that only justified and approved programs are included in
the budget submissions. HQ USAF, HQ AFMC, and the Major Commands review these programs jointly
with ALC personnel involved in managing the programs. This review provides a forum to discuss issues,
resolve problems, and establish an Air Force position on logistics tasks and goals, and supports the finan-
cial plan and the POM for each of the DPEM customers.
36                                                                   AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007


     4.12.1. Pre-review Process. The LSR schedule is posted to the DPEM CoP. It includes the dates for
     the LSR review at each ALC and the dates the pre and post review J01 products are to be provided to
     the customers. At this point, several concurrent actions are initiated to prepare for the review. These
     are:
        4.12.1.1. The ALC Aircraft & Missile RPM is responsible for completing all file-maintenance by
        the Pre-Review run date. File maintenance includes ensuring the programmed schedules in MP&E
        reflect the latest negotiated schedules; ensuring the hours for programmed workloads reflect the
        validated MRRB hours; ensuring the correct sales rates are used; and ensuring all un-programmed
        workloads have been updated.
        4.12.1.2. The HQ AFMC CSA will ensure that DISA is notified of the pre-review date so that a
        flat file of the MP&E Aircraft & Missile data is ran and provided to each ALC Aircraft & Missile
        FSA for use in the DPEM Database interface.
        4.12.1.3. The ALC MP&E Aircraft & Missile FSA ensures that all personnel involved with
        MP&E or the LSR at the ALC are aware of the schedule provided in the LSR data call. The ALC
        FSA assists in preparing an agenda for the review, and coordinates it with the ALC participants,
        the ALC LSR focal point, and the HQ AFMC focal point for the review. After coordination, the
        agenda is posted to the DPEM CoP. The ALC Aircraft & Missile FSA is responsible for providing
        electronic copies of the J01 reports to each participant of the review upon the pre-review date. On
        that date, the ALC OPR will run J01 reports for each participant and save them in a PDF format
        for electronic transmission. The J01 reports are also posted to the DPEM CoP. The ALC Aircraft
        & Missile FSA also uses the flat file provided by DISA to run an interface with the DPEM Data-
        base. This is to ensure aircraft & missile requirements are reflected in the DPEM Brochures.
        4.12.1.4. HQ USAF and the MAJCOM customers, upon receiving their files of the pre-review
        products, compare the data in those products with mission needs, the force & financial plan, the
        force structure projections, and any other documents which may be the cause of changes to the
        stated requirement in MP&E. Customers are to forward questions concerning their requirements
        to the ALC FSA prior to the LSR, so the SPD can provide answers at the review.
        4.12.1.5. The ALC will continue to update MP&E after the pre-review products are produced. All
        changes that occur after the pre-review will be presented for approval by the review team.
        4.12.1.6. Aircraft and Missile Contingency Work Projections worksheets are provided to the
        MAJCOM customers at least two weeks before the LSR. A separate worksheet must be prepared
        for each contingency PCN showing the execution PCNs, the dollar amount that has generated
        against the contingency in the current FY, and a three-year history of actual generations against the
        contingency PCN. This information must be available for use by the review team to determine if
        the contingency dollar amounts need to be adjusted.
     4.12.2. Formal Logistics Support Review (LSR). The LSR starts with the opening remarks. This is
     followed by a detailed review of the programs as outlined on the agenda. Participants who are inter-
     ested only in select items need be present only when these items are being discussed. At the end of the
     review, the team leaders collect comments for inclusion in the out brief. During the out brief, the team
     leaders discuss the status of the ALC systems and equipment with the ALC management.
        4.12.2.1. Aircraft & Missile programs are reviewed by weapon system at the PCN level. All cus-
        tomers of the weapon system being reviewed should be in attendance to ensure concurrence with
        decisions made.
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                            37


     4.12.2.2. The ALC Aircraft & Missile FSA attends all aircraft & missile reviews and provides
     assistance by having the proper people in the right place at the right time; monitoring progress of
     the reviews and making alternate plans if necessary; ensuring action items are documented, ensur-
     ing call-backs are documented and completed, and ensuring any requested change pages are pro-
     vided.
     4.12.2.3. The ALC Aircraft & Missile RPM is the focal point for their weapon system review. The
     RPM is responsible for having the proper people in attendance at the review and is responsible for
     completing any action items, call-backs, or change pages that occur.
  4.12.3. Logistics Support Post-Review Process. Decisions made at the review are documented in
  the MP&E post-review products. The following actions are accomplished after each review:
     4.12.3.1. The HQ AFMC CSA checks the post-review processing schedule prepared when the
     review was announced. Any changes that need to be made are sent to the ALC FSA for implemen-
     tation. The HQ AFMC CSA will ensure that DISA is notified of the post-review cycle so that the
     proposed line will be copied to the approved line and so that a flat file of the MP&E Aircraft &
     Missile data is ran and provided to each ALC Aircraft & Missile FSA for use in the DPEM Data-
     base interface.
     4.12.3.2. The ALC Aircraft & Missile RPM updates MP&E according to the decisions made at
     the review. Additionally, a customer or the HQ AFMC focal point may direct the ALC to file
     maintain urgent changes that generate after the review so that they can be included in the
     post-review products. Any verbal request to make these urgent changes will be followed by a writ-
     ten confirmation.
     4.12.3.3. The ALC Aircraft & Missile FSA is responsible for providing electronic copies of the
     post-review J01 reports to each participant of the review upon the post-review date. On that date,
     the ALC OPR will run J01 reports for each participant and save them in a PDF format for elec-
     tronic transmission. The J01 reports are also posted to the DPEM CoP. The ALC Aircraft & Mis-
     sile FSA also uses the flat file provided by DISA to run an interface with the DPEM Database.
     This is to ensure aircraft & missile requirements are reflected in the DPEM Brochures.

                                               Chapter 5

                                              ENGINES

5.1. Introduction to Engines. Engine requirements are reflected in RGCs E and F. Programmed require-
ments are reflected in RGC E and includes major overhauls (A jobs), minor repair (B jobs), and
Two-Level Maintenance (2LM). Un-programmed requirements are reflected in RGC F and include labor
and/or material for work not normally done on overhauls. Examples are accelerated maintenance testing
and ACI, one time repair, beginning of programmed work to determine history data, Quality Deficiency
Report (QDR) test and inspection, Teardown Deficiency Report (TDR) test and inspection, and action
required to prepare engines for disposal, including environment protection requirements. Product Quality
Deficiency Report (PQDR) test and inspection is also included for engines not under warranty. Depot
Field Team (DFT) support is always funded as RGC F.

5.2. Data Sources
     5.2.1. Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance (DPEM) Brochure. The DPEM database produces
     the DPEM Brochure that is used to review MAJCOM requirements during the LSR. The DPEM Bro-
     chure summarizes requirements by PCN and provides narratives detailing changes in programs.
     5.2.2. Sales Rates and Prices for the Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG) of the Air Force
     Working Capital Fund (AFWCF). Yearly sales rates and prices are provided by HQ AFMC/FMR.
     5.2.3. Financial Management Handbook. The Financial Management Handbook can be found at the
     following link: https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/FM/FMRS/index.htm, chapter 92
     of the handbook covers the DPEM process.

5.3. PCN Structure. All engine requirements are reflected in RGC E or F. When establishing RGC E or
F PCNs, the following fields are mandatory: Customer, Manager Division, Source of Repair, Program
Code, Sub Program Code, PUC, Work Breakdown Code, RPM, EEIC, and Organization codes. The PEC,
Technology Repair Center, SCN ID, Overseas Workload Code, Country, Multi Pseudo Code ID, Suffix
Code, and Suffix Code ID fields are optional. See Attachment 3-Attachment 24 for a complete list of
codes. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying or deleting a PCN are provided in the MP&E Training
Manual.

5.4. Standards Tables. For RGCs E and F, the Hourly Rate and Engine Service USP can be input to a
Standards Table. Using the Standards Table allows the user to make mass changes to RGC E and F
records. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying or deleting standards are provided in the MP&E
Training Manual. The table standards are run by a batch module, and transactions are run nightly.
Changes will be reflected the following day for those RGC E or F records that do not have an over-ride
selected.

5.5. Repair Requirements. Once a PCN is established in MP&E, a requirements record should be estab-
lished. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying or deleting a requirements record are provided in the
MP&E Training Manual.
     5.5.1. Requirement Schedule Screen.
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                             39


     5.5.1.1. For RGC E requirements, the Quantity, USP, and EIDPSH must be file-maintained for
     each FY. A zero must be entered for those FYs with no known requirements. The USP field can be
     file maintained directly in the Requirement Schedule Screen or can be propagated from the Stan-
     dards Table. When adding a new requirements record, the USP field will be propagated with infor-
     mation from the Standards Table, if one exists, the fields will be grayed out. Selecting the USP
     Override box will zero out the USP fields, allowing the user to directly file-maintain the USPs.
     Selecting the Override box again will fill the USP fields with information from the Standards
     Table. If the USP override box is grayed-out, a USP standards table does not exist.
     5.5.1.2. For RGC F requirements, the Hourly Rate and Total Hours must be file-maintained for
     each FY. A zero must be entered for those FYs with no known requirements. The Hourly Rate
     field can be file maintained directly in the Requirement Schedule Screen or can be propagated
     from the Standards Table. When adding a new requirements record, the Hourly Rate field will be
     propagated with information from the Standards Table, if one exists, the fields will be grayed-out.
     Selecting the Hourly Rate Override box will zero out the rate fields, allowing the user to directly
     file-maintain the rates. Selecting the Override box again will fill the rate fields with information
     from the Standards Table. If the Hourly Rate override box is grayed-out, then an Hourly Rates
     standards table does not exist.
  5.5.2. Sub-Customers. Reimbursement Sub-customer Code is a two position code which identifies
  the customers of the EEIC 54X that reimburses the EEIC 54X to pay for that portion of the EEIC 54X
  program negotiated with the DMAG that supports the customer requirements. Requirement Schedule
  of engine quantities for all reimbursable sub-customers supported by a pseudo code establishes the
  percentage of support provided to each. The percentage of the total requirements identified to the
  reimbursement sub-customer and to the Pseudo Code should correlate and match. Additionally, the
  total of each within an FY must equal 100 percent.
  5.5.3. Weapon System Percents. Weapon System Percents must be added before the requirements
  record can be saved. More than one weapon system can be added, but the total percentage must equal
  100% for each FY.

                               OTHER MAJOR END ITEMS (OMEI)

6.1. Introduction to OMEI. OMEI includes all programmed (RGC G) and un-programmed (RGC H)
repair of hardware that does not fall under aircraft, missiles, engines or exchangeables. OMEI includes
PDM, DFT support, and un-programmed repair and overhaul for Communications-Electronics, space sys-
tems, ground power generators, railway equipment, and vehicles. It also includes cryogenic systems, sup-
port equipment, Automated Test Equipment (ATE), hush houses, and noise suppressers. Vehicle repair
requirements are entered in the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS), which then inter-
faces with MP&E. The remaining OMEI requirements are directly file-maintained in MP&E.

6.2. Data Sources
     6.2.1. Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance (DPEM) Brochure. The DPEM database pro-
     duces the DPEM Brochure that is used to review MAJCOM requirements during the LSR. The DPEM
     Brochure summarizes requirements by PCN and provides narratives detailing changes in programs.

     the following link: https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/FM/FMRS/index.htm, chap-
     ter 92 of the handbook covers the DPEM process.

6.3. PCN Structure. All OMEI requirements are reflected in RGC G or H. OMEI PCNs are limited in
scope to a single customer and a single SOR. When establishing RGC G or H PCNs, the following fields
are mandatory: Customer, Manager Division, Source of Repair, Program Code, Sub Program Code, PUC,
Technology Repair Center, Work Breakdown Code, RPM, EEIC, and Organization Codes. The PEC, SCN
ID, Overseas Workload Code, Country, and Multi Pseudo Code ID fields are optional. See attachments
(which attachment) for a complete list of codes. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying or deleting a
PCN are provided in the MP&E Training Manual.

6.4. Standards Tables. For RGCs G and H, the Hourly Rate can be input to a Standards Table. Using the
Standards Table allows the user to make mass changes to RGC G and H records. From the Program Main-
tenance Menu, select the Requirements Standards Maintenance icon. To add a new standard, select the
Add button. From the drop-down menu in the Standard Type field, select “Hourly Rate.” The RGC field
becomes mandatory. Select RGC G or H. The SOR field then becomes mandatory. Select the SOR, then,
add the hourly rate(s) to the table. The table standards are run by a batch module and transactions are run
nightly. Hourly rate changes will be reflected the following day for those RGC G or H records that do not
have an over-ride selected.

6.5. Repair Requirements. Once a PCN is established in MP&E, a requirements record should be estab-
lished. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying or deleting a requirements record are provided in the

                                         EXCHANGEABLES

7.1. Introduction to Exchangeables. Exchangeable programs are identified in three separate RGCs.
     7.1.1. RGC J. RGC J is limited to repair of exchangeables under the Management of Items Subject to
     Repair (MISTR) system. These are not serial number controlled, but are under production count and
     control. A PCN should be established for each Federal Stock Class (FSC) and Material Management
     Aggregation Code (MMAC), and SOR. MISTR exchangeable requirements are computed by item
     managers and file maintained by National Stock Number (NSN) into D200A. Those requirements are
     then sent to D075/ABCS for file maintenance, primarily to assign a valid MP&E PCN to each NSN.
     After file maintenance, the files are sent to MP&E for upload and to reflect applicable changes. RGC
     J requirements can be added or adjusted in MP&E as required. If the D075 interface has a PCN/SCN,
     which is erroneous for the NSN or if the NSN has no PCN/SCN, it will be placed in a holding area in
     MP&E and an Alert message will be generated and made available to the RPM so they can take the
     appropriate action
     7.1.2. RGC K. RGC K includes all negotiated exchangeable item workloads other than MISTR that
     have a defined production count and control. These are workloads negotiated through project direc-
     tives similar to but outside of the MISTR system. These types of items are normally either repair or
     return or non-catalogued. These requirements are uploaded from the ABCS interface.
     7.1.3. RGC L. RGC L includes all miscellaneous exchangeable workloads outside of MISTR and
     project directives. Where possible, requirements are stated by FSC/MMAC or aggregated similar to
     the structure in MISTR. Exception to this is reclamation, which cannot normally be broken down by
     FSC/MMAC. Much of the work accommodated under this RGC is of an emergency nature requiring
     a quick turn-around of an item to prevent a mission deprivation or production stoppage. Prototypes
     and Quality Deficiency Reports/Material Deficiency Reports (QDR/MDR) are also accomplished
     under this RGC. It also includes repair and return of items that do not have sufficient condition
     checks, demilitarization, reclamation, etc. of items for MSD, Air Force Stock Fund not included in
     RGCs J or K. RGC L requirements are directly file maintained in MP&E.

7.2. Data Sources
     7.2.1. Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance (DPEM) Brochure. The DPEM database produces
     the DPEM Brochure that is used to review MAJCOM requirements during the LSR. The DPEM Bro-
     chure summarizes requirements by PCN and provides narratives detailing changes in programs.
     7.2.2. Sales Rates and Prices for the Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG) of the Air Force
     Working Capital Fund (AFWCF). Yearly sales rates and prices are provided by HQ AFMC/FMR.

     7.2.4. Automated Budget Compilation System (ABCS).

7.3. PCN Structure. Exchangeable requirements are reflected in RGCs J, K or L and are limited in scope
to a single customer and a single Source of Repair (SOR). When establishing an RGC J, K or L PCN, the
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                                  43


following fields are mandatory: Customer, Manager Division, Source of Repair, Program Code, Sub Pro-
gram Code, PUC, Technology Repair Center, Work Breakdown Code, RPM, EEIC, and Organization
Codes. The PEC, SCN ID, Overseas Workload Code, Country, and Multi Pseudo Code ID fields are
optional. See attachments for a complete list of codes. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying or
deleting a PCN are provided in the MP&E Training Manual.
   7.3.1. Technology Repair Center (TRC) Assignment. When establishing a PCN in support of
   Exchangeables it is mandatory to identify the correct TRC when establishing a PCN for RGC J and
   RGC K. The TRC is optional for RGC L; however, if the RGC L PCN represents an exchangeable
   type item then the TRC must be identified. The TRC must coincide with the Sub-Program Code fields
   on the PCN request. For example, if the Sub-Program Field is "6605-NT" then you must assign a TRC
   representing the Sub-Program Field. The TRC Table in MP&E is controlled by HQ AFMC.
NOTE: Only NSNs which fall under the Valid TRC are to be assigned to the PCN. The TRCs and their
descriptions are located in a drop-down menu on the PSEUDO Code Detail screen.

7.4. Standards Tables. For RGC L, the Hourly Rate can be input to a Standards Table. Using the Stan-
dards Table allows the user to make mass changes to RGC L records. From the Program Maintenance
Menu, select the Requirements Standards Maintenance icon. To add a new standard, select the Add but-
ton. From the drop-down menu in the Standard Type field, select “Hourly Rate.” The RGC field becomes
mandatory. Select RGC L. The SOR field then becomes mandatory. Select the SOR, then, add the hourly
rate(s) to the table. The table standards are run by a batch module; transactions are run nightly. Hourly rate
changes will be reflected the following day for those RGC L records that do not have an over ride
selected.

7.5. Repair Requirements. Once a RGC L PCN is established in MP&E, a requirements record should
be established. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying or deleting a requirements record are provided
in the MP&E Training Manual.
   7.5.1. Requirement Schedule Screen. For RGC L requirements, the Hourly Rate and Total Hours
   fields must be file-maintained for each FY. A zero must be entered for those FYs with no known
   requirements. The Hourly Rate field can be file-maintained directly in the Requirement Schedule
   Screen or can be propagated from the Standards Table. When adding a new requirements record, the
   Hourly Rate field will be propagated with information from the Standards Table, if one exists, the
   fields will be grayed out. Selecting the Hourly Rate Override box will zero out the rate fields, allowing
   the user to directly file-maintain the rates. Selecting the Hourly Rate Override box again will fill the
   rate fields with information from the Standards Table. If the Hourly Rate Override box is grayed-out,
   a rate standards table does not exist.
   7.5.2. Weapon System Percents. Weapon System Percents must be added before the requirements
   record can be saved. More than one weapon system can be added, but the total percentage must equal
   100% for each FY.

              AREA SUPPORT/BASE SUPPORT/LOCAL MANUFACTURE (A/B/M)

8.1. Introduction to AREA/BASE/MANUFACTURE. A/B/M programs are identified in four separate
RGCs.
     8.1.1. RGC M. Area Support provides organic assistance to Air Force Bases in RGC M in response
     to the using MAJCOMs needs, as governed by T.O. 00-25-107 and T.O. 00-25-108, in an ALCs geo-
     graphical area. Area assistance is provided in situations where an O&I workload requirement is
     beyond the capability of or in excess of the using MAJCOM/agency. Although the area support pro-
     gram is constructed to serve the Air Force, its services are available to non Air Force customers as
     well. An example of an RGC M requirement is calibrating test measurement and diagnostic equip-
     ment in an ALC DMAG owned Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory. If the calibration is
     done for a user at a different Air Force Base in the ALCs geographical area, it is area support. If the
     calibration is done for a user on base, it is base or tenant support. This is organic only
     8.1.2. RGC N. Base and tenant support is in RGC N. Includes assistance to the Air Force base and all
     tenants of that base upon which a DMAG organic facility is located. This organizational and interme-
     diate support is provided through an agreement between the ALC and other AFMC facility managers
     and the base or tenant unit. This RGC also includes foreign national training; sustaining engineering
     requests directed to the SOR by HQ AFMC, quality audit program for both expense and investment
     items; repair of items in support of the GSD, AFSF, reclamation support requested directly by local
     redistributing and marketing, and PMEL support of base and tenant units. All tasks under this RGC
     are in support of organizational and intermediate level requirements only. This is organic only
     8.1.3. RGCs P & R. Manufacture of items in support of the Supply Management Activity Group
     (SMAG) is in RGC P. Manufacture for requirements other than those supporting the SMAG is in RGC
     R. Central Procurement appropriations as well as other customers funding can fund them. Manufac-
     ture is authorized under certain conditions such as emergencies (i.e. to prevent work stoppages or sup-
     port field mission essential requirements), filling the time lag in procurement, or lack of a commercial
     source. This is organic only.

8.2. Data Sources
     8.2.1. Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance (DPEM) Brochure. The DPEM database produces
     the DPEM Brochure that is used to review MAJCOM requirements during the LSR. The DPEM Bro-

                                                SOFTWARE

9.1. Introduction to Software. Depot level maintenance support for software requirements are reflected
in RGC S. Chapter 97 of the Financial Management Reference System provides policies and procedures
for developing software requirements. MAJCOM software requirements are reviewed/validated during
the Logistics Support Review (LSR). The validated requirements are file maintained in MP&E, along
with any non MAJCOM requirements (i.e FMS, Navy, etc.).

9.2. Data Sources
     9.2.1. Software Support Requirements Documentation (AFMC Form 230) and Software Task
     Detail Description (AFMC Form 231). The AFMC Form 230/231 is prepared using the Software
     Requirements Application (SRA) database and is reviewed during the annual Software Requirements
     Review (SRR). The AFMC Form 230/231 provides detailed information by PCN.
     9.2.2. Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance (DPEM) Brochure. Information in the SRA
     database is exchanged with the DPEM database. The DPEM database produces the DPEM Brochure
     that is used to review MAJCOM requirements during the LSR. The DPEM Brochure summarizes
     requirements by PCN and provides narratives detailing changes in programs.
     9.2.3. Sales Rates and Prices for the Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG) of the Air
     Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF). Yearly sales rates and prices are provided by HQ AFMC/
     A8W, Working Capital Funds Division.
     9.2.4. Financial Management Handbook. The Financial Management Handbook can be found at
     the following link: https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/FM/FMRS/index.htm, chap-
     ter 92 of the handbook covers the DPEM process and chapter 97 covers software requirements.

9.3. PCN Structure. All software requirements are reflected in RGC S. Software PCNs are limited in
scope to a single customer and a single SOR. When establishing an RGC S PCN, the following fields are
mandatory: Customer, Manager Division, Source of Repair, Sub Program Code, PUC, Work Breakdown
Code, RPM, Suffix Code, Suffix Code ID, EEIC, and Organization Codes. The PEC, SCN ID, Overseas
Workload Code, Country, and Multi Pseudo Code ID fields are optional. See attachments for a complete
list of codes 2-24. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying or deleting a PCN are provided in the
MP&E Training Manual.
     9.3.1. Sub-Program Code. The Sub-Program field is an open field. The MDS/TMS should be used,
     if applicable.
     9.3.2. Suffix Code. Once the suffix code is selected, the Program Code and the Suffix Code ID fields
     will be automatically filled based on the suffix code. For each category of software, there is a threat or
     non-threat option.
        9.3.2.1. Threat – Includes software workloads that will require quick turnaround during wartime.
        Feedback from operational forces based on intelligent information garnered from contact with the
        enemy will determine required response time.
        9.3.2.2. Non-Threat – Lower priority workloads that will not directly affect war-fighting capa-
        bility of the United States Forces.
AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007                                                                                 47


   9.3.3. Suffix Code ID : The Suffix Code ID will be displayed once the Suffix Code is selected. The
   field will turn red and the record cannot be processed until a 3-digit surge factor is added. The surge
   factor represents “what-if” happenstance to workload in time of war. For example, if the workload
   would double, the surge factor would be 2.0. If the workload would remain the same, the surge factor
   would be 1.0. and if decreased by half, the surge factor would be 0.5.

9.4. Standards Tables. For RGC S, the Hourly Rate can be input to a Standards Table. Using the Stan-
dards Table allows the user to make mass changes to RGC S records. From the Program Maintenance
Menu, select the Requirements Standards Maintenance icon. To add a new standard, select the Add but-
ton. From the drop-down menu in the Standard Type field, select “Hourly Rate.” The RGC field becomes
mandatory. Select RGC S. The SOR field then becomes mandatory. Select the SOR, then, add the hourly
rate(s) to the table. The table standards are run by a batch module and transactions are processed nightly.
Hourly rate changes will be reflected the following day for those RGC S records that do not have an over
ride selected.

9.5. Repair Requirements. Once a PCN is established in MP&E, a requirements record should be estab-
lished. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying or deleting a requirements record are provided in the
MP&E Training Manual.
   9.5.1. Requirement Schedule Screen. For RGC S requirements, the Hourly Rate and Total Hours
   fields must be file-maintained for each FY. A zero must be entered for those FYs with no known
   requirements. The Hourly Rate field can be file-maintained directly in the Requirement Schedule
   Screen or can be propagated from the Standards Table. When adding a new requirements record, the
   Hourly Rate field will be propagated with information from the Standards Table, if one exists, the
   fields will be grayed out. Selecting the Hourly Rate Override box will zero out the rate fields, allowing
   the user to directly file maintain the rate(s). Selecting the Hourly Rate Override box again will fill the
   rate fields with information from the Standards Table. If the Hourly Rate Override box is grayed out,
   a rate standards table does not exist.
   9.5.2. Weapon System Percents. Weapon System Percents must be added before the requirements
   record can be saved. More than one weapon system can be added, but the total percentage must equal
   100% for each FY.

     ter 92 of the handbook covers the DPEM process.

10.3. PCN Structure. All storage requirements are reflected in RGC 1. Storage PCNs are limited in
scope to a single customer and a single SOR. When establishing an RGC 1 PCN, the following fields are
mandatory: Customer, Manager Division, Source of Repair, Program Code, Sub Program Code, PUC,
Work Breakdown Code, RPM, EEIC, and Organization Codes. The PEC, SCN ID, Overseas Workload
Code, Country, and Multi Pseudo Code ID fields are optional. See Attachment 1-Attachment 20 for a
complete list of codes. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying or deleting a PCN are provided in the
MP&E Training Manual.

10.4. Standards Tables. For RGC 1, the Hourly Rate can be input to a Standards Table. Using the Stan-
dards Table allows the user to make mass changes to RGC 1 records. From the Program Maintenance
Menu, select the Requirements Standards Maintenance icon. To add a new standard, select the Add but-
ton. From the drop-down menu in the Standard Type field, select “Hourly Rate.” The RGC field becomes
mandatory. Select RGC 1. The SOR field then becomes mandatory. Select the SOR, then, add the hourly
rate(s) to the table. The table standards are run by a batch module and transactions are processed nightly.
Hourly rate changes will be reflected the following day for those RGC 1 records that do not have an
over-ride selected.

10.5. Repair Requirements. Once a PCN is established in MP&E, a requirements record should be
established. Detailed instructions for adding, modifying or deleting a requirements record are provided in
the MP&E Training Manual.
     10.5.1. Requirement Schedule Screen. For RGC 1 requirements, the Hourly Rate and Total Hours
     fields must be file maintained for each FY. A zero must be entered for those FYs with no known
     requirements. The Hourly Rate field can be file-maintained directly in the Requirement Schedule

  Screen or can be propagated from the Standards Table. When adding a new requirements record, the
  Hourly Rate field will be propagated with information from the Standards Table, if one exists, the
  fields will be grayed out. Selecting the Hourly Rate Override box will zero out the rate fields, allowing
  the user to directly file maintain the rate(s). Selecting the Hourly Rate Override box again will fill the
  rate fields with information from the Standards Table. If the Hourly Rate Override box is grayed out,
  a rate standards table does not exist.
  10.5.2. Weapon System Percents. Weapon System Percents must be added before the requirements
  record can be saved. More than one weapon system can be added, but the total percentage must equal
  100% for each FY.

     It has requirements through production for current year, and requirements plus PA values for budget
     year and, if in the 4th quarter, the 1st out-year. This product covers entire “life cycle” of requirement
     by PCN. It begins with gross requirements, adjusted requirements, PA, funded requirements negoti-
     ated, input, and production values. All values include quantity, hours, and dollars except DPAH and
     DPSH entries.
     11.2.4. MPE02 Posture Planning DLM Report. Same as MPE02 DLM Report, but pulls data from
     Posture Planning database?

11.3. IDF Reports and Queries Listing. The following is a list of reports and queries available to prod-
uct directorates at each ALC.
     11.3.1. MPEADEVL.E01-NSN End Item Identity Active/Inactive List. This IDF query provides
     production management with a list of NSN items, RGCs G, H, J, and K, within organizations that have
     recurring or future repair requirement. The list is sequenced by NSN and shows, in the SRC field,
     whether the item was interfaced (*) or manually file maintained (#) into MP&E. For NSN end items
     there are two sheets/tabs to query, the second sheet/tab shows the SOR percentage breakout. This
     query has the capability to provide visibility of current workload for three (3) years history, current FY
     and seven (7) out years.
     11.3.2. MPEADEVL.E01-NON-NSN End Item Identity Active/Inactive List. T h i s I D F q u e r y
     provides production management with a list of NON-NSN items, all RGCs except J, within the orga-
     nizations that have recurring or future repair requirements. The list is sequenced by PCN and shows
     the source of the information. This query has the capability to provide visibility of current workload
     for three (3) years history, current FY and seven (7) out years. An individual PCN will be retained on
     this product until all eleven (11) years’ field values for requirements and production are zero.
     11.3.3. MPEADEVL.E02 Long-Range Workload Requirements Plan. This IDF query contains
     the same information as MPEADEVL.E04. The only difference is sequencing of the data. The E02 is
     by PCN in lieu of RPM code in the E04. It gives RPMs a display of repair requirements provided
     mechanically from D075, or manually input transactions broken out by PCN.
     11.3.4. MPEADEVL.E03 Long-Range Requirements by Subsystem/PMS Sequence. T h i s I D F
     query reflects MISTR requirements, RGC G, J, and K, by subsystem or RPM. This query reflects lat-
     est repair requirement, up to 32 quarters of D075 mechanically provided computed items, for analysis.
     This query has two sheets/tabs; one is a detailed (NSN) level; and the other a summary (subsystem)
     level. If the SOR is contract or inter-service, these requirements should be compared to current con-
     tract/inter-service documents to determine if changes should be made. If so, amend the G072D, cus-
     tomer order acceptance list (COAL) for contract and inter-service changes and the AF Form 185,
     Project Order for organic revisions. Information on this product is used by MM to verify accuracy of
     file maintained requirement quantities; by seller PMS to develop contractual or inter-service agree-
     ments; and by seller PMS to determine validity of workload distribution of those items having more
     than one SOR. All requirements are mechanically provided from D075.
     11.3.5. MPEADEVL.E04-NSN Long-Range Workload Requirement Plan. T h i s I D F q u e r y
     reflects repair requirements for, RGCs G, J, and K, and is identified to the individual RPMs. This
     query reflects latest repair requirement, up to 32 quarters of D075 mechanically provided computed
     items, for analysis. If the SOR is contract or inter-service, these requirements should be compared to
     current contract/inter-service documents to determine if changes should be made. If so, amend G072D

  this product is used by MM to verify accuracy of file maintained requirement quantities; by the seller
  PMS to develop contractual or inter-service agreements; and by seller PMS to determine validity of
  workload distribution of those items having more than one SOR. All requirements are mechanically
  provided from D075.
  11.3.6. MPEADEVL.E04-NON-NSN Long-Range Workload Requirement Plan. This IDF query
  reflects repair requirements for all non-stock listed items and is identified to individual RPMs by
  PCN. This query has the capability to provide visibility of current workload for three (3) years history,
  current FY and seven (7) out years.
  11.3.7. MPEADEVL.E05 Requirement by Contract Reason Code. T h i s q u e r y i d e n t i f i e s
  exchangeables that are on contract and the reason they were not work-loaded organically. This query
  has two sheets/tabs, first sheet/tab being detailed information and second sheet/tab being summary
  data.
  11.3.8. MPEADEVL.E09-SUBCUSTOMER End Item Application Customer/Command Inter-
  rogation Response. This query contains reimbursement sub-customers and percent of support to
  each; and, commands supported with percent of support to each for 8 FYs.
  11.3.9. MPEADEVL.E09-WEAPON SYSTEM End Item Application Customer/Command
  Interrogation Response. This IDF query displays current weapon system supported and projected
  percent of support provided to each weapon system for 8 FYs.
  11.3.10. MPEADEVL.E11 End Item Workload Distribution Percentage Interrogation
  Response. This IDF query is used to determine or verify current workload distribution between all
  contract, inter-service, and organic SORs for a specific end item. Each PCN displays SOR designation
  and thirty-two quarters of distribution percentages. This product is used by MM to change existing
  workload percentages to reflect changing SOR capabilities. This query contains mechanically com-
  puted requirements from the D075 system.
  11.3.11. MPEADEVL.E44-NSN Long-Range Workload Requirement Plan. T h i s I D F q u e r y
  reflects, RGCs G, J, and K, identified to individual RPMs. This query reflects latest repair require-
  ment, up to 32 quarters of D075 mechanically provided computed items, for analysis. If SOR is con-
  tract or inter-service, these requirements should be compared to current contract/inter-service
  documents to determine if changes should be made. If so, amend G072D COAL for contract and
  inter-service changes and AF Form 185 for organic revisions. Information on this query is also used
  by MM to verify accuracy of file maintained requirement quantities. It is accomplished by seller PMS
  to develop contract or inter-service agreements and by seller PMS to determine validity of workload
  distribution of those items having more than one SOR. All requirements are mechanically provided
  from D075.
  11.3.12. MPEADEVL.E44-NON-NSN Long-Range Workload Requirement Plan. T h i s                        IDF
  query reflects all non-stock listed items identified to individual RPM. This query reflects the latest
  repair requirement, up to 32 quarters of manually file maintained data, for analysis. If the SOR is con-
  tract or inter-service, these requirements should be compared to current contract/inter-service docu-
  ments to determine if changes should be made. If so, amend G072D COAL for contract and
  inter-service changes and AF Form 185 for organic revisions. Information on this query is also used
  by MM to verify accuracy of file maintained requirement quantities. It is accomplished by seller PMS
54                                                                    AFMCMAN20-1 23 MARCH 2007

     distribution of those items having more than one SOR.
     11.3.13. MPEADEVL.E45, End Item Workload Distribution Percentage Interrogation
     Response. This IDF query is in IMS sequence and is used to determine or verify current workload dis-
     tribution between all contract, inter-service, and organic SORs for a specific end item. It contains such
     information as actual EIID, job designator (JD), PCN, SOR, FY, and workload percent. Each PCN dis-
     plays SOR designation and 32 quarters of distribution percentages. This product is used by IMS to
     assist in managing and validating their requirements
     11.3.14. MPEADEVL.F04 Pseudo File Maintenance Report (Pseudo Code Sequence). This IDF
     query shows the applicable program data for each PCN, in PCN sequence. The initiator must make
     sure that data is accurate so that DMAG financial resource managers can make correct decisions on
     programming and reprogramming. This information is used for core workloads, BRAC transfers, and
     workload review. This data is provided to other systems through mechanical interfaces for validation
     of PCN/SCN information.
     11.3.15. MPEADEVL.F05 Pseudo File Maintenance Report (Program Sequence). T h i s                    IDF

                               REPAIR GROUP CATEGORIES (RGC)
RGC CATEGORY & DEFINITIONS
A      AIRCRAFT-FIXED FACILITY/SELECTED OFFBASE TASKS
Includes recurring aircraft depot level maintenance, concurrent organizational and intermediate work, and
TCTO Mods that can be forecast using Air Force programming documents. Serial number control is man-
datory and input/output schedules will be developed. All expenditures, including line support manufac-
ture and routed work, are controlled by specific aircraft serial number once the aircraft is input to work.
Damage repair, accomplished or actual, is in RGC A, unless accomplished by a field team; then it should
be in RGC B. Fixed facility aircraft mod kit proofing is also in RGC A. Organic work loaded RGC A cus-
tomer orders, are charged to type 1 project orders. Costs to customer are based on an organic unit sales
price composed of a given hourly rate times number of hours, or on a contract/inter-service unit sales
price based on unit repair cost. Workload is accomplished either through organic (EEIC 54101), contract
DMAG (EEIC 54100), Contract Depot Maintenance (EEIC 56010), or Inter-Service agreement (EEIC
54102).
B      AIRCRAFT-SERVICE WORK
Includes field team work and un-programmed aircraft workloads not in RGC A. Includes workloads for
which a specific input/output has not been formalized and planned organic reclamation of complete air-
craft. All damage repairs accomplished by a field team and depot level field team efforts are in RGC B.
Input/output schedules will be developed. Once a workload is input in the RGC, it remains in the RGC
through completion. Requirements are based on workload projections by MD. When specific end item is
identified, requirement is expressed by MDS. Organic work loaded RGC B, customer orders are charged
to type 6 project orders. Workload is accomplished either through organic (EEIC 54101), contract DMAG
(EEIC 54100), Contract Depot Maintenance (EEIC 56010), or Inter-Service agreement (EEIC 54102).
C      MISSILE-FIXED FACILITY
Includes all programmed missile depot maintenance requirements for which a specific input/output
schedule is developed. If accomplished organically as cost class (CC) 1, all expenditures, including line
item support manufacture and routed work, are controlled by specific missile serial number once the mis-
sile is input to work. Costs to customer are based on a unit sales price composed of a fixed hourly rate
times the number of hours, or on a contract/inter-service unit sales price based on unit repair cost. All
organic work loaded RGC C, customer orders are charged to type 2 project orders. Workload is accom-
plished either through organic (EEIC 54201), contract DMAG (EEIC 54200), Contract Depot Mainte-
nance (EEIC 56020), or Inter-Service agreement (EEIC 54202).
D      MISSILE-SERVICE WORK
Includes field team and un-programmed missile workloads not in RGC C. Includes: onsite repair, engi-
neering/quality analysis, storage, and reclamation. Maintenance on operational and maintenance ground
equipment can be accomplished in this RGC. Requirements are based on some form of workload projec-
tions and are expressed by MD until the specific end item is identified, upon which requirement is
expressed by MDS. All organic work loaded RGC D, customer orders are charged to type 6 project
orders. Workload is accomplished either through organic (EEIC 54201), contract DMAG (EEIC 54200),
Contract Depot Maintenance (EEIC 56020), or inter-service agreement (EEIC 54202).

DEFINITION OF THREAT AND NONTHREAT
THREAT—Includes software workloads that will require quick turnaround during wartime. Feedback
from our operational forces based on intelligence information garnered from contact with the enemy, will
determine required response time.
NONTHREAT—Will include lower priority workloads that will not directly affect war-fighting capabil-
ity of the United States Forces.
SURGE FACTORS
The war-surge factor will need to be identified for each PCN. For example, if you have a peace time
requirement of 1000 hours per year and that workload would double in size in time of war, then the surge
factor would be 2.0. If it remained the same, then the surge factor would be 1.0. If the workload decreased
50 percent in time of war, then the surge factor would be 0.5.
