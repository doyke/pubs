                                       INTRODUCTION
1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make available a training aid that will
assist Diet Therapy Technicians in developing technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks.
The tasks are broken down into teachable steps, which help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming
proficient with the tasks. The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task
certification.

2. As a trainer, direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of
this QTP. Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to
learn each step; some steps may take more time than others. Remember that the purpose of this QTP is to
ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training and is
ready to be evaluated on the objective, follow the evaluation instructions. Conduct a feedback with the
trainee on this QTP. After you have ensured and documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the
task, a certifier should evaluate the trainee.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that
will meet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP). We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have
suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP,
please let us know about them.

REMARKS/NOTES:


EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks or as an end
   product evaluation. (Whichever applies.)

2. After the trainee has received instructions, allow sufficient practice on each part of the
   task. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

3. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task
   are accomplished. NOTE: This QTP is evaluated in 3 parts. Part I is the initial 3 week, 3
   shift schedule. Parts II and III, involve changes to the schedule. The Performance
   Scenario should be given to the trainee one part at a time and evaluated upon completion
   using the Evaluation Schedule contained in this QTP, along with the information provided
   in the information section. The evaluation schedule is provided only as a guide for
   evaluation. The trainees’ schedule may be slightly different. Job duties and titles will be
   the same but names may be different. If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective,
   document appropriately in the individual’s training record. If the trainee does not
   accomplish the objective, review the areas needing more training until the objective is
   met.

4. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial
   evaluation should be documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the
   trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation should be documented using AF Form
   1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved
   substitute record.

                                 Personnel Scheduling

INFORMATION FOR THE TRAINEE:

           PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE PERSONNEL SCHEDULING

The schedule contains the names of all persons employed by, assigned, or attached to the
Nutritional Medicine (NM)*. Personnel, when possible should be scheduled for a 40
hour week of 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, unless local directives prescribe an
alternate scheduling procedure such as a Compressed Work Schedule. The Compressed
Work Schedule allows individuals to work four 9-hour days plus one 8-hour day, and
then four 9-hour days with a 3-day weekend on alternate weekends. You may choose not
to implement alternate schedules for shift workers depending on local conditions. Try
rotating days off so employees have one weekend off as often as the operational
requirements and desires of the staff will allow. The schedule must forecast each
person’s duty days, hours of duty, and days off. Example: if an individual’s duty day is
a Monday with duty hours of 0500-1400, the schedule should reflect 0500-1400 in the
block instead of using “E” which means Early shift. All codes used on the duty schedule
must be explained. Example: Administrative Officer of the Day (AOD), Bay Orderly
(BO), Leave (LV), and Temporary Duty Assignment (TDY). Unplanned changes such as
sickness, emergency leaves, or AWOL are posted promptly. For civilian employees an
AF Form 2581, Daily Absentee Record, is completed by the shift leader and attached to
AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Record of Employee, or follow local procedures. Proper
supervision requires personnel to be scheduled effectively; otherwise the 8-hour day and
40 hour week could be exceeded. An annual leave plan for civilian and military
personnel should be developed at the beginning of each calendar year.

Flexibility in scheduling personnel must be maintained. All shifts are to be balanced to
give necessary coverage. Meal hours and break periods for NM personnel are scheduled
to minimize interruptions of work. They should be scheduled so food is prepared as close
as possible to the time patient trays are assembled and the dining facility opens.

Shift leaders assign shift personnel daily work tasks using AF Form 2577, Medical Food
Service Daily Work Assignment, or a suitable locally developed substitute.
Recommended procedures for setting up the work schedule for personnel are as follows:

There are many factors to consider when scheduling personnel. Always begin with the
current schedule. Pay close attention to the following areas: 1) The shift starting times
(are they too early/late). 2) The length of the duty day (13 hours from open to close or a
24-hour operation). 3) Does the weekend shift have too many/not enough people? 4) Are
there enough personnel to cover peak work periods? 5) How often do workers get
weekends off, total number of shifts, and length of shifts? Remember that good
personnel scheduling means a person should be scheduled for no more than 8-hours
of work per day. If everything is working well with the current schedule, don’t change
it.

                                 Personnel Scheduling

When scheduling personnel you need to consider several factors:

1. Personnel allocations.

2. Schedule simplicity.

3. Morale of NM.

4. Quality of personnel assigned (skill level and workload potential.)

5. Covering the peak/light work loads with the appropriate number of personnel.

6. Reducing non-productive time of worker (more personnel than actually required
should not be scheduled before or after peak workload hours, which is 1000-1400 hours.)

7. Collect data (analyze past system, production of food, the menu, available equipment,
and times people are actually working, determine the minimum number of personnel you
need to accomplish the mission, and look at the number of personnel available and the
capabilities of each.)

8. Study the data collected.

Listed below are a series of steps designed to help establish a rough draft work schedule:

Step 1: Determine the total number of personnel assigned to the section. Example:

Diet Therapy Craftsman                       MSgt                           1
Diet Therapy Craftsman                       TSgt                           1

Step 2: Break down the categories of specialist into two groupings according to their
capabilities and skills. Example:

TOTAL                                                    35

Step 4: Determine the minimum daily manning requirement per shift and other key
positions. Example:

                                  Personnel Scheduling

Step 5: Group personnel of similar capabilities and skills together on a master schedule
form. Plot out days off for each group. Care should be taken to remember:

1. Personnel should rotate days off. Example: after the third Saturday, each person
drops to the next position and the last position moves to the first. When using a three-
shift schedule, all shift personnel normally rotate days off at the same time.

2. Each person should have six days off in a 21-day period.

3. Have as many two consecutive days off as possible. (Remember the first day of the
week is Sunday.)

4. Consider each group one at a time.

5. Have more persons off on the weekend, when they are not needed/depending on actual
workload.

6. Have no more than five consecutive days of duty at any one time.

Step 6: Designate the hours of duty for each position. Decide the earliest time someone
should be on duty. This is based on size of facility, type of service and meal hours for
staff and patients. Decide the number of personnel actually needed for the last one or two
hours of the NM day.

Step 7: Other considerations are: Cleaning days require more employees. In-service
training days should be scheduled on days when the most employees are on duty. How
often to repeat/rotate the schedule. Additional duties for military personnel such as
details/training, personal concerns of staff such as school, child-care, part-time jobs.
Food service workers should be scheduled one hour later than cooks so pots and pans can
be cleaned after food preparation, and late shift leader should come in after other late
shift members so sanitation/security checks are made after the shift has ended.

Step 8: If minimum coverage is not achieved for shifts and key operational areas,
consider the following alternatives:

1. Change individual’s shift.

2. Change days off.

3. Cancel scheduled leaves.

4. Use personnel not assigned to shift (modify nourishment duties to allow that person to
work shift, etc.)

TYPES OF SCHEDULES

                                           Staggered

A staggered method of scheduling personnel is the most effective means of scheduling to
fulfill your peak workload requirements. A staggered schedule is much like progressive
cooking; you gradually increase the number of personnel as the peak workload
approaches. By bringing personnel on duty gradually, the greatest number is on duty at
the peak period and the least number are on hand for the light work period. Example:

POSITION                                            TIME PERIOD

                                                    ÄÅ

You can see from the chart that by staggering the duty hours of the cooks less people are
required on duty during slower periods and the maximum number are present for duty
during peak work periods. This allows for more efficient use of available manpower and
allows for personnel to have two consecutive days off at regular intervals. The benefits of
adequate coverage far outweighs the extra time required for planning this type of
schedule. A limitation of this schedule is personnel may forget their duty hours when
they change schedules between early, late, and swing. Additionally, personnel do not
work together for the entire shift.


                Three Shifts (1 Shift Early - 1 Shift Late – 1 Shift Off)

The method illustrated below has the advantage of adequate coverage during peak work
periods and the same group of people work together all the time. Stop and ask do we
really need this many cooks at 0500 and 1900 hours? Many man-hours are wasted
because the same number of people is on duty during slack work periods as is on duty
during peak work periods. Personnel do have two consecutive days off. Example:

                               One Shift On – One Shift Off

The least acceptable method of scheduling is one shift on and one shift off. You can see
below that no extra help is scheduled for peak work periods and many man-hours are
wasted during the beginning and the end of each duty day. Personnel are on duty too
many continuous hours. A 14-hour duty day could cause fatigue and decreased
efficiency during the last four or five hours. You could also experience low morale and
short tempers among co-workers.

SCHEDULING FOR YOUR FACILITY

Variations of these basic methods of scheduling are being practiced. Of the three
methods, the staggered method is the most flexible in terms of production coverage.
Example: This methods works best for a full-foodservice department.




QTP 4D071-2                                     8                                      APRIL 2000
                                  Personnel Scheduling

The scheduling system you choose must be adapted to your facility. One system will not
work exactly the same in all facilities. Example: Sections feeding only patients may
choose to use the One shift on – One shift off due to limited number of personnel.

Whatever system of scheduling you use, be absolutely certain you meet the minimum
requirements of proper personnel scheduling. Be sure your schedule reflects:

1. Names of all personnel assigned.

2. A 40-hour work-week.

3. An 8-hour per shift duty day (with the exception of the one shift on/one shift off
method.)

4. A 5 day work week (This guideline may be subject to local scheduling policy such as
a compressed work schedule of 9-hour days and alternate 3 day weekend.)

5. Forecast days of duty, hours of duty, days off, leave, and details.

SELLING THE SCHEDULE

As you prepare to install the new schedule you will need to sell it. Employees may be
resistant to change because new things are sometimes hard to accept. You must be aware
and be prepared for this to happen. To minimize the resistance, involve some of the staff
in developing the new schedule. Additionally, a meeting with all employees to explain
the new schedule might help avert resistance to change.

IMPLEMENTING THE SCHEDULE

The decision to implement a new schedule should be carefully studied prior to its
implementation. There should be basic rationale and philosophy that explain why a
particular type of schedule was chosen for the section. This may be expressed in the
form of an operating instruction so all personnel will have an understanding of the
philosophy and procedures for making the schedule.

Work schedule implementation problems can usually be decreased if sufficient time and
attention are devoted to preparatory tasks such as setting a changeover date,
disseminating the information on the new schedule and its proposed changeover
priorities, and reviewing the impact of the new schedule upon personnel policies and
administrative procedures.

EVALUATING THE SCHEDULE

Once the new schedule has been implemented you must evaluate it to ensure the new
schedule is effective. Does it satisfy the production requirements of your section? Are
you better able to manage the personnel under you. Do your personnel spend more time
being productive?

QTP 4D071-2                                   9                                 APRIL 2000
                                  Personnel Scheduling



Another area that needs to be evaluated is the flexibility of the schedule. Does the
schedule allow you to fill all positions within your operation? Can shift rotations easily
be made to the schedule?

                                    Performance Scenario

                                          PART I

Using AF Form 2578 or suitable locally developed substitution, the information outlined
in Principles of Effective Personnel Scheduling, and the following scenario, schedule
personnel using a combination staggered and three shift methods. Ensure both early and
late shifts are staggered for a three-week period. In the second and third week of the
schedule rotate shifts days off and include all personnel (military and civilian) in the
rotation. Personnel must be scheduled to ensure operational hours (0500-1900 hrs) are
covered and minimum manning requirements outlined in Personnel Scheduling
Information are met each day of the schedule. Develop schedule so that on Wednesdays
all shifts are on duty. List all Monday – Friday workers together and separate them from
shift workers. List all shift workers, military and civilian, together if they work at the
same shift.

                              Meal Hours are as follows:
                           Breakfast           0600 – 0730
                           Lunch               1100 – 1300
                           Dinner              1630 – 1730

NOTE 1: Do not develop your schedule based on your current or past medical
facility workload, personnel utilization, etc. Follow the instructions given in the
scenario.

NOTE 2: Days off rotation normally would not be done weekly, this exercise is to
test your understanding of the rotation process.

After you have completed your schedule, have your trainer check the schedule before
going to Part II. The names and positions of your personnel are as follows:

Performance Scenario

                                        PART II

Using the schedule developed in Part 1 and the following scenarios, make required
changes to your schedule ensuring minimal manning is achieved each day of the three-
week schedule. Minimal manning must be achieved without working shift personnel
more than 5 days per week or 40 hours per week. All personnel must be given 2
consecutive days off, within a 40 hour week (except when rotating days off). The week
begins with Sunday.

Your early shift has one PTS worker on leave for the first week. The Assistant NCOIC
has Continuing Medical Readiness Training (CMRT) the first Thursday from 0700-1600.
One food service worker on late shift is on annual leave for the first Thursday, and the
baker is on leave Thursday and Friday of the first week.

You are notified on Wednesday week one of the following situations:

1. One of the cooks from early shift wants emergency leave (EL) on Thursday week one.

2. One of the food service workers from early shift will be on sick leave (SL) Thursday
and Friday of week one.

3. One PTS worker from early shift has been put on quarters (Q) for Wednesday and
Thursday of week one.

Make changes to your schedule to reflect these last minute changes, without calling in
personnel who are off-duty, canceling leaves, details, or training.

NOTE 1: Remember when completing all scenarios in Part II that minimum manning is 8
persons per shift and check how many personnel are required for each of the positions on
shift.

NOTE 2: The abbreviations used in the scenarios are not approved abbreviations in each
case but are to be used when adjusting the schedule developed in Part 1.

NOTE 3: Civilians are only charged annual and sick leave on days they are scheduled for
duty, the type of leave should be indicated such as sick leave (SL) or annual leave (AL).

1. One swing shift PTS worker has Bay Orderly the first Sunday through the second
Friday and has a compensatory day off (C) on Saturday of week two.

2. One swing shift worker takes four days annual leave the second week of the schedule.

3. The Assistant NCOIC has Administrative Officer of the Day (AOD) duties on the
second Wednesday and will be given a compensatory (C) day off on Thursday.

The following emergency situations arise:

1. One early cook gets hit on the head by a walk-in refrigerator door and will be out for
four days during the second week of the schedule.

2. Storeroom clerk requires nine days emergency leave starting the first Saturday through
the third Sunday. The Assistant NCOIC will run the storeroom on Monday, Tuesday,
and Friday of the second week. One late PTS worker (who has storeroom experience)
will work in the storeroom on Wednesday and Thursday of the second week.

3. One late PTS worker is placed on 48 hours quarters (Q), for the flu, on the second
Monday and Tuesday.

4. On the third Sunday a late PTS worker is stricken with food poisoning requiring him
to be hospitalized for five days.
