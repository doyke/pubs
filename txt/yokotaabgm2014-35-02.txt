MEMORANDUM FOR BASE MULTIMEDIA CENTER CUSTOMERS

FROM: 374 AW/CC
      Unit 5078
      APO AP 96328-5078

SUBJECT: 374 AW Multimedia Products and Services

        1. The items in memorandum are a list of products and services offered by the 374th Public
Affairs Base Multimedia Center. Products and services are provided for official use only as outlined in
AFI 35-109, Visual Information, paragraph 2.2.

         2. Air Force multimedia resources are government-owned property used for official mission
support and historical documentation purposes. All resources must meet the guidelines of the National
Archive and Records Administration (NARA). Unofficial use of multimedia resources, or their products
and services, is illegal and violators are subject to prosecution. Unofficial use by military personnel
violates Article 92 of the UCMJ and may result in punitive action. Unofficial use by civilian personnel
may result in administrative or other disciplinary action under applicable civilian personnel regulations or
instructions. Refer to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and AFI 65-603,
Official Representation of Funds, for clarification or exclusions. The customer’s signature on the AF
Form 833, Multimedia Work Order, certifies the products requested will be used for official
purposes only.

         3. Multimedia products that Air Force members and civilian employees produce or collect in
their official duties become the property of the United States Air Force. Multimedia products that
contractors produce or collect in their official duties become property of the United States Air Force. Any
product collected or produced to include the use of personal photographic/video equipment or self-help
equipment on federal property is subject to local Public Affairs review prior to being used outside of the
military.

        4. Motion media (video) personnel and equipment are restricted to operational requirements
except to document retirements or promotion ceremonies honoring MAJCOM, Numbered Air Force,
wing, and vice wing commanders. Change of Command ceremonies, important historical figures such as
Medal of Honor winners, Order of the Sword recipients, or aerial aces are also authorized for video
documentation for historical and informational purposes.

       5. Still media photographic personnel, equipment, and material may be used to document official
ceremonies, such as formal awards. When multimedia personnel are not available, the base Multimedia
Center may offer consumer-grade photographic equipment for self-help use. Do not use government-
funded multimedia resources to:
       a. Provide souvenirs, personal gifts, mementos or farewell gifts.

       b. Support or document farewell parties or social events, unless certified as newsworthy or
          having historical significance by the base historian or chief of PA.

       c. Create products used primarily for entertainment during farewell parties or social events.

       d. Support MWR or services-sponsored recognition programs.

       e. Provide passports photos for civilian passports, unless required by official military orders.

         6. Deviations from this memorandum for special needs/purposes require a memorandum of
justification signed by the requesting unit commander. Requesting units may be required to supplement
cost for services above and beyond those specified in this memorandum.

       7. The following priority system will be used to determine availability of services provided:

       Priority I: Emergency incidents requiring immediate response
       Priority II: Mission-essential or urgent conditions requiring 1 or 2 days response time
       Priority III: Normal day-to-day mission requirements – 5 working day response
       Priority IV: Necessary, routine requirements – accomplished on a space-available basis

   8. Any questions regarding this memorandum should be referred to the Chief, Internal Information at
225-8833.

accordance with AF Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

   The guidance in this memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the date of this
memorandum, or upon release of an AF publication incorporating the guidance, whichever is earlier.
