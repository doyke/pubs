5.9.1.3.4.3. Aircraft are ranked/prioritized utilizing categories (CAT) I to V (I being best and V
being worst), based on the severity of paint deterioration. Once categorized, the aircraft are
identified on the paint schedule with the required paint time and minimum cure time estimates.
NOTE: A 24 hour paint cure is established only when the CCF heating system is operating at a
75 degree Fahrenheit temperature, otherwise a 72 hour paint cure will be imposed IAW TO 1-1-
8, Application and Removal of Organic Coatings, Aerospace and Non-Aerospace Equipment.
5.9.1.3.4.3.1. CAT I ranking indicates a negligible condition not requiring maintenance.
5.9.1.3.4.3.2. CAT II ranking indicates a correctable condition with SEMPEN paint pens, minor
spraying, and/or brush touch-up, usually limited to slat leading edges or exposed composite
materials. An estimated time in commission (ETIC) is set at 3 days plus 24-72 hours cure before
flight depending on conditions. Aircraft paints in this category should be minimized and only be
identified on the paint schedule if the Wing CCP deems it necessary.
5.9.1.3.4.3.3. CAT III ranking indicates a condition that may include sectionalized painting of
wing leading edges, nacelles, and flaps. An ETIC is set at 4 days plus 24-72 hour cure before
flight depending upon conditions. Immediate requirements for identifying CAT III aircraft on the
paint schedule will be determined by the Wing CCP.
5.9.1.3.4.3.4. CAT IV ranking indicates a condition requiring complete repaint of major
components involving most zones. An ETIC is set at 5 days plus 24-72 hour cure before flight
depending on conditions. Aircraft placed in CAT IV status will be immediately identified on the
paint schedule and coordinated for paint at the aircraft’s soonest availability.
5.9.1.3.4.3.5. CAT V ranking indicates an aircraft requiring complete repaint of major
components involving most zones and large areas of the fuselage. An ETIC is set at 6 days plus
24-72 hour cure before flight depending on conditions. Aircraft placed in CAT V status will be
immediately identified on the paint schedule and coordinated for paint at the aircraft’s soonest
availability.
5.9.1.3.5. (Added-OPR 62 MXS/MXMFB) Assigned aircraft painted over 300 square feet

11.19. (OPR 62 MXG/QAI) LM requests are normally restricted to mission-essential aircraft
parts, related support systems, and depot-directed field-level manufacture items. The Source,
Maintenance, Recoverability (SMR) code defines manufacturing responsibility, with the first two
digits determining whether a part is manufactured or procurable and by what organization. 62
MXS normally manufactures SMR codes “MFO”, “MFF” and “AFO”. Items SMR coded “XB”
are not procured through normal supply channels and will be reviewed for local manufacture on
a case by case basis. The responsible local manufacture shop will have approval/disapproval
authority based upon material availability and manufacturing capability.
11.19.1. (OPR 62 MXG/QAI) Designate 62 AMXS/MXS Operations Officers (MOO),
Maintenance Superintendents, Maintenance Directors, or Production Superintendents as LM

11.19.8.1. MICAP requests for any locally manufactured part, regardless of SMR code, will not
be processed through the DOL SharePoint. Verification will first be made with the appropriate
repair shop that on-aircraft repair will not correct the discrepancy.
11.19.8.2. If local manufacture of a MICAP component can be accomplished, the requestor will
coordinate directly with MXS Production Superintendent. After coordination with the MXS
Production Superintendent and verification by the manufacturing shop that the part can be
fabricated, requester will place a request with Aircraft Parts Store (DOL/APS) using Local
Manufacture Check sheet. (Attachment 21).
11.19.8.3. Once the request has been processed and an A0A/A0E is produced, Aircraft Parts
Store (DOL/APS) will contact the MXS Production Superintendent for pick-up of the A0A/A0E.
11.19.8.4. Once fabrication is complete, the final manufacturing shop will annotate the cost of
the item on the A0A/A0E and coordinate with the MXS Production Superintendent to arrange
pick-up/delivery of the part. Upon delivery/receipt of the part, the requestor will sign the
A0A/A0E. The MXS Production Superintendent will ensure the A0A/A0E is hand carried or sent
via facsimile to DOL.
11.19.9. (Added-OPR 62 MXG/QAI) Local Manufacture Cancellation/Disapproval Process.

14.39. (Added-62 MXG/QAI) Critical Tire Inspections (CTI)
14.39.1. (Added-OPR 62 MXG/QAI) A CTI is a special inspection on C-17A tires with tire
wear and/or cut limits that are more stringent than the applicable technical order inspection
requirements. These inspections are conducted on aircraft transiting locations or performing a
specific mission where tire reliability is of the utmost importance to ensure mission
accomplishment. CTIs are required for:
14.39.1.1. (Added) Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) missions (REF: AFI 13-526, Prime
Nuclear Airlift Force Operations)
14.39.1.2. Phoenix Banner/Silver (Presidential support) missions.
14.39.1.3. As required, based on specific mission taskings.
14.39.2. (Added-OPR 62 MXG/QAI) Limited CTI (LCTI) will be directed by the
MXG/CC/CD or designated representative. LCTIs are less stringent than the CTI requirement,
but maintain the emphasis on prolonging tire reliability at airfields with limited or no tire change
capability. The limits in paragraph 14.39.5 are designed to increase the reliability, as mission
requirements may dictate, at locations or situations not addressed in the paragraphs above. The
MXG/CC/CD or designated representative should base the decision to perform LCTIs on airfield
conditions and operational factors.
14.39.3. (Added-OPR 62 MXG/QAI) CTI and LCTI Procedures.
14.39.3.1. Production superintendents will ensure CTIs and LCTIs are performed on identified
aircraft. Tires will be inspected and the results documented in accordance with this instruction
and the references listed in Attachment 1. Any tire not meeting minimum inspection
requirements will be documented in the AFTO Form 781A.
14.39.3.2. CTIs will be accomplished on both primary and backup aircraft (if applicable) and
tire replacements will be accomplished on both aircraft in accordance with production priorities.
Any decision not to change affected tires on identified aircraft will be made by the MXG/CC/CD
or designated representative.
14.39.3.3. Aircraft movement. If an aircraft is towed after a CTI is accomplished, another CTI
will be performed and documented in the aircraft’s AFTO Form 781A.
14.39.4. (Added-OPR 62 MXG/QAI) CTI Limits.
14.39.4.1. Any non PNAF mission requiring a CTI will follow these inspection requirements:
14.39.4.1.1. Cuts: Tires with cuts that exceed one-half the embossed cut limits or cuts of more
than ½ inch in length will be replaced. If a sidewall cut extends into the cord body, the tire will
be replaced as prescribed in TO 4T-1-3, Inspection, Maintenance Instructions, Storage, and
Disposition of Aircraft Tires and Inner Tubes.
14.39.4.1.2. Wear: Tires with a measurement of less than 3/32-inch depth over the full length of
any 12-inch span of a tire tread will be replaced.
AFI21-101_AMCSUP_62AWSUP 8 AUGUST 2014                                                           45


14.39.4.1.3. For PNAF CTI requirements, refer to AFI 13-526 for limits.
14.39.4.2. Critical tire inspection limits for missions and locations identified in paragraph
14.39.1.
14.39.4.2.1. Cuts: Tire cuts with a depth of 1/32-inch or less than the embossed tire cut limit,
will be replaced (Example: 8/32-inch cut on a tire with a 9/32-inch embossed cut limit needs to
be replaced). If a cut extends into the cord body of the sidewall, the tire will be replaced as
prescribed in TO 4T-1-3.
14.39.4.2.2. Wear: Tires with a measurement of less than 3/32-inch depth over the full length of
any 12-inch span of a tire tread will be replaced IAW the aircraft generation schedule.
14.39.5. (Added-OPR 62 MXG/QAI) LCTI Limits.
14.39.5.1. Cuts: Use the same cut limit described in paragraph 14.39.4.2.1.
14.39.5.2. Wear: Tires with a measurement of less than 2/32-inch length depth over the full
length of any 12-inch span of a tire tread will be replaced in accordance with the aircraft
generation schedule.
14.39.6. (Added-OPR 62 MXG/QAI) Documentation. The AFTO Form 781A will have a
dash symbol and the following entry in the discrepancy block: “Critical Tire Inspection
(CTI)/Limited Critical Tire Inspection (LCTI) due.” When the inspection is completed, the
discrepancy will be signed off with the following entry placed in the corrective action block for
aircraft tires that pass the inspection: “CTI/LCTI complied with—all tires within CTI/LCTI
limits.” For tires that fail the CTI, the following entry will be entered in the corrective action
block: “CTI/LCTI complied with, (specific number) tires failed.” Tires changed as a result of a
CTI/LCTI will be referenced to the original CTI discrepancy.
14.39.6.1. Units may want to inspect several aircraft to select the best candidate for the mission.
In this circumstance, an “Info Note” is sufficient documentation (e.g., INFO NOTE: CTI
performed IAW AFI 21-101 _AMC Supp 1_62 AW Sup 1, paragraph 14.39.4.2.1. Tires 3, 5 and
nose tires bad). However, once an aircraft has been selected to fill the mission requirement
follow the documentation process in paragraph 14.39.6 (Added 62 AW).
14.40. (Added-OPR 62 MXG/QAP)               Request for Engineering Disposition Instructions
(REDI).
14.40.1. (Added-OPR 62 MXG/QAP) An Engineering Disposition (ED) requires the
submission of a completed REDI to Boeing C-17 Field Engineering Support. Prior to completing
a REDI, 62/446 MXG personnel will exhaust all possible resources (training, experience,
technical data, tools, support equipment, etc.). If no fix or repair is possible, then a REDI should
be submitted to Boeing for assistance. The ED process now utilizes a web based system called
VECTOR. When the online REDI form is completed in VECTOR, an email notification is
automatically sent to 62 MXG QA Product Improvement Office (QAP) and to Boeing Field
Engineering. Once Boeing has completed the ED, the initiator will receive an automatic email
notification. The initiator can then enter VECTOR and retrieve the ED.
14.40.2. (Added-OPR 62 MXG/QAP) There are two priority levels for REDI submission:

14.42. (Added-62 MXG/QAI) Fall Protection and Rescue Response Procedures:
14.42.1. Fall protection will be used every time personnel are more than four feet above a
surface to include accessing the upper fuselage, wing and tail areas. Refer to technical order
(TO) 1C-17A-2-00JG-00-1, for harness wear instructions and attach point locations.
14.42.2. Prompt rescue following a fall, as defined in AFI 91-203, is “getting to the subject
within six minutes after an accidental fall.” To meet this requirement, whenever maintenance is
performed on top of the aircraft fuselage, wing, T-tail, or whenever fall restraint equipment is
used maintenance personnel will ensure the following:
14.42.2.1. A ground spotter will be used at all times. EXCEPTION: Maintenance tasks that
require additional personnel who are not on top of the aircraft surface (For example, an
additional person on a stand assisting someone on top of the wing) do not require a ground
spotter.
14.42.2.2. A maintenance stand tall enough to reach a fallen worker will be present at the
aircraft. Prior to personnel accessing the T-tail, a Condor or other suitable high-reach equipment
will be positioned and prepared for use. Personnel qualified to operate the high-reach equipment
AFI21-101_AMCSUP_62AWSUP 8 AUGUST 2014                                                            49


must be on site, but are not required to stand by in the equipment. MXG/CC may waive this
requirement for MRT/Flying Crew Chief (FCC) in obscure locations.
14.42.3. Upon recognizing that a worker has fallen, the ground spotter will immediately notify
MOC and the production superintendent/dock coordinator. The spotter will then initiate actions

14.45.2. AMXS personnel will inspect all assigned aircraft terminating at home station and Pro
Supers will request contract services as necessary to maintain a clean aircraft. The single
criterion for ordering a wash/cleaning (except a complete wash) will be the need for that service.
Automatically ordering services because an aircraft has returned from, or is about to depart on a
mission, is not authorized. For flight line wash services, this need will be verified by
Maintenance Supervision or a Production Superintendent prior to scheduling the service through
PS&D or the MOC.
 52                                        AFI21-101_AMCSUP_62AWSUP 8 AUGUST 2014


14.45.3. Authorized personnel will request contract services by contacting PS&D or the MOC.
PS&D or the MOC will prepare an AFTO Form in G081. MOC only schedules minor interior
washes. The AFTO Form 349 will contain a JCN, the aircraft identification number, type of
service required, and the scheduled time that the service is required. The AFTO Form 349 will
then be transmitted to the printer designated for contractor use. If the G081 system is down,
PS&D or the MOC may call the contractor to request a wash service. However, as soon as the
G081 system is back up, the requester must transmit an AFTO Form 349 to the contractor, even
if the job has been completed. The contractor needs a hard copy of the AFTO Form 349 for
payment purposes.
14.45.4. The contractor will forward the completed AFTO Form 349 to MXG/QAE for service
validation.
14.45.5. If a wash service cannot be accomplished as scheduled, personnel responsible for, or
first aware of the delay, (i.e. AMXS/MXS) will notify the MOC (extension 982-3336) of the
delay or termination of the service requirement. The MOC will coordinate with PS&D during the
following dayshift to ensure job orders (AFTO Form 349) are completed, rescheduled, or
terminated. If an aircraft cannot be turned over to the contractor within one hour of the scheduled
time, it must be rescheduled to start no sooner than 12 hours after the originally scheduled time.
Rescheduled wash start times may differ from normal start times in order to match mission
requirements.
14.45.6. As soon as possible after completion, the contractor will sign off the wash due write-up
in G081. Clearing wash acceptance write-ups remains the owning squadron’s responsibility.
14.45.7. The contractor is not allowed to create a wash job order (AFTO Form 349) in G081.
This can only be accomplished by PS&D or the MOC.
14.45.9. For complete washes, the owning organization will deliver all aircraft to the contractor
at the scheduled time. The contractor will accomplish all towing, servicing, and wash preparation

          E-TOOL 90 DAY INSPECTION AND CLEANING REQUIREMENTS

Figure A32.1. (Added) E-Tool 90-Day Inspection and Cleaning Requirements.


These inspection and cleaning requirements are intended to help maximize the service life of the
equipment as well as provide resolution to common issues that may be encountered.

1. E-Tool Case: Inspect for broken, loose or missing parts, fasteners, screws, cracks and
damage.
2. Port/dust covers: Inspect for broken, loose, cracked or missing covers.
3. Keyboard: Inspect for broken or missing keys. If installed inspect keyboard cover for cracks,
damage, and serviceability.
4. Carrying Handle: Inspect for broken, loose or missing parts, fasteners, screws, cracks,
damage and serviceability.
5. Screen Housing: Inspect for cracks and damage around the housing. Also check for loose or
missing screws.
6. Screen: Inspect for cracks and damage.
7. Screen Cleaning: With proper usage and cleaning, the E-Tool display will last the anticipated
life of the product in the field (three to five years) without significant changes in view ability or
function. Key to achieving this performance is proper cleaning of the screen.

NEVER SPRAY WATER OR CLEANING SOLUTIONS DIRECTLY ON THE E-TOOL.
ALWAYS USE AN APPROVED CLEANING CLOTH.

a. For mild cleaning tasks, always use the provided micro-fiber cleaning cloth; tougher
contaminates such as oily fingerprints may require light dampening with clean water. Plain water
in combination with the cleaning cloth will be effective for most contaminants, and should
always be tried before stronger solutions are considered.
b. For tougher cleaning tasks a mixture of Isopropyl alcohol and water (50/50) used in
combination with the cleaning cloth will be effective and will not damage the Touch Screen
surface.
c. NEVER use paper products such as paper towels or wipes to clean the display surface. Paper
products are abrasive and will act like fine sandpaper when used on the screen surface. This can
cause damage to the screen surface and the anti-glare coating.
8. Keyboard Cover Cleaning:
a. For mild cleaning tasks, always use the provided micro-fiber cleaning cloth; tougher
contaminates such as oily fingerprints may require light dampening with clean water. Plain water
in combination with the cleaning cloth will be effective for most contaminants, and should
always be tried before stronger solutions are considered.
b. For tougher cleaning tasks a mixture of Isopropyl alcohol and water (50/50) used in
combination with the cleaning cloth will be effective.

*Corrective action: Take corrective action as required. Be sure these items are documented on
the MIL and LOGNET has been notified for resolution.

1.     Contact MOC to change aircraft status/lock out G081 and initiate QRC. Secure/”X” forms
      with impoundment write up and reason for impoundment.
2.    Attend debrief with aircrew if possible. Ensue all specialists are present. Retain AC’s
      contact information in case you have further questions. If unable to attend formal debrief,
      contact crew to obtain thorough information regarding condition. Reach CP for contact
      information.
3.    Collect/route stored or perishable date for analysis (SFDR, QAR, CVR, fluid from samples
      from affected systems, samples from any AGE or equipment used to service the aircraft, i.e.
      fuel trucks, lox carts, hydraulic mules, etc.). Verify through Wing Safety that the
      information is releasable prior to routing.
4.    Ensure CVR and FDR circuit breakers are pulled immediately after engine shutdown or
      before applying external power.
5.    Control access to impound assets (both acft and equipment. Establish isolation area for acft
      using cones, ropes, or placards. An ECP can be established, but must have a control log with
      name, rank, employee number, time/dates of entry and departure, and the reason for entry.
6.    When available, review appropriate records for discrepancy history (G081 screen 8070,
      F8005, applicable training records, acft jacket file). Search 180 days of history
7.    Establish a dedicated repair team. Coordinate with squadrons/flights to obtain necessary
      technicians for troubleshooting and repair, as well as any required support equipment. This
      includes Boeing support.
8.    Ensure only impoundment related maintenance actions are performed unless otherwise
      authorized by the Releasing Authority. This includes cargo offload actions until cleared by
      Bioenvironmental for physiological events.
9.    Ensure no cannibalization actions are taken against the affected asset without specific
      authorization of the Releasing Authority.
10.   Ensure all required maintenance is performed IAW applicable tech orders, to include a
      special inspection (borescope, hard landing, lightning, etc.). Provide direct, personal
      supervision.
11.   Ensure any required maintenance is properly documented to include any significant items for
      the AFTO Form 95. Recommend using a log book.
12.   Brief Releasing Authority daily on the progress of impoundment related maintenance.
13.   When corrective action will be removal/replacement of a defective engine, ensure the
      impoundment is transferred to the affected engine. Attach an AFTO Form 350 to the engine
      with the word "IMPOUNDMENT" printed in red in the discrepancy block prior to
      transporting to Engine Management. Additionally, notify QA, who will sign the
      impoundment statement.
14.   Review the aircraft forms prior to seeking impoundment release.
15.   Report to QA for review of all forms.
16.   Report to the Releasing Authority for release from impoundment. Ensure all applicable
      background data is available.
