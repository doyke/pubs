1. Overview. FOD and DOP is the responsibility of every individual working in or around the
airfield. Commanders and supervisors with missions on the airfield or supporting aircraft
operations are responsible for implementing these procedures. Continual training, awareness and

discipline are important elements of an effective FOD/DOP program. The overall program
objective is “ZERO FOD and DO” mishaps.
     1.1. Foreign Object Damage (FOD). FOD is any damage to an aircraft engine, aircraft
     system, equipment or tire caused by an external foreign object (FO) which may or may not
     degrade the required safety or operational characteristics of the engine, aircraft system or tire.
     Common causes of FOD are poor housekeeping, improper maintenance practices and aircraft
     taxiway or ramp deterioration.
     1.2. Dropped Object Prevention (DOP). A dropped object (DO) is any aircraft part,
     component, surface or other item lost during aircrew operations from engine start to engine
     shutdown, unless intentionally jettisoned. Inadvertently released munitions or munitions
     released in excess of the quantity selected by the aircrew are not considered dropped objects
     and will be reported IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
     1.3. Any area where a noticeable FO hazard is identified shall be immediately reported
     through Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) at 366-4321 and Airfield Management at
     366-4188 to ensure the applicable ramp/runway area is swept or cleared before engine run or
     taxi operations begin.
