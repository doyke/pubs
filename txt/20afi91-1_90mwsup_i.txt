1. Vehicle Operator Responsibilities.
     1.1. When a vehicle mishap occurs in the missile complex, the wing commander or
     designated representative will consider restricting travel on that stretch of road until safety
     personnel investigate, review the circumstances and recommend releasing the road to
     unrestricted travel.
     1.2. Vehicle Crew Concept (VCC). Everyone in the vehicle shares responsibility for safety
     and mission accomplishment. Each member of the crew has specific responsibilities and is
     accountable for safely completing the mission. The senior ranking person is responsible for
     the safe vehicle operation and occupant safety. The vehicle crew concept applies to all
     Government Motor Vehicles (GMVs) driven in the missile field complex for missile field
     operations. Each occupant will participate in mission planning, to include route selection and
     risk management and ensure all personnel and equipment is secure.
     1.3. A first-aid kit, route folder, spare tire, jack and highway warning kit will be available in
     the vehicle prior to trip departure. Additionally, during locally determined periods, all
     occupants will carry personal cold weather gear and the vehicle will be equipped with a
     winter survival kit. See Attachment (Atch) 1 for recommended survival kit items.
     1.4. All items (survival kits, vehicle accessory kits, tools, personal bags/A-3 bags, Individual
     Protective Equipment not worn, etc.) will be secured to prevent shifting/movement during
     travel and potential injury to personnel.
     1.5. Security Forces personnel will secure their weapon(s) at all times. Weapons will be
     secured in such a manner as to remain secured if the vehicle is involved in a mishap.
20AFI91-1_90MWSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                               3


       1.5.1. (Added-90MW) All maintenance personnel will secure their weapon(s) at all
       times. Weapons will be secured in such a manner as to remain secured if the vehicle is
       involved in a mishap.
   1.6. Vehicle headlights will be used at all times. Daytime running lights will suffice during
   daylight hours as long as they are on.
   1.7. The Operational Risk Management (ORM) process will include driver selection and
   factors outlined in paragraph 3.1. Whenever possible, the senior ranking passenger will be in
   the front seat. The front seat passenger will remain alert throughout the dispatch, assist in
   identifying hazards and ensure driving regulations and laws are obeyed. NOTE: For the
   purposes of conducting driver and safety observer evaluations, the senior ranking individual
   is authorized to sit in the back seat (if conducting an evaluation).
   1.8. Vehicle operator and passenger(s) will monitor road conditions and, if different from
   those briefed, report observed conditions to Transportation Control Center (TCC). The
   safety observer will handle all communication requirements. When factors affecting road
   conditions deteriorate enough to implement a change in Travel Condition, operators will stop
   in a safe location. To avoid/minimize the potential of a traffic mishap, stop at a rest area, gas
   station or parking lot, if available. Engage hazard-warning lights. Notify TCC of conditions
   and await permission to continue travel.
2. Speed Limits.
   2.1. All speed limits are maximums based on optimum road and weather conditions.
   Personnel operating GMVs will comply with all federal, state, local, and commander-
   directed speed limits, and will lower speed whenever road and weather conditions warrant.
   2.2. At no time will a vehicle be operated at speeds unsafe for conditions. The maximum
   speed limit on all gravel roads is 25 miles per hour or lower, as road and weather conditions
   dictate.
       2.2.1. (Added-90MW) Speed limits for all personnel (military or civilian) who operate
       government vehicles off-base on interstate highways are as follows:
          2.2.1.1. (Added-90MW) Commercial vehicles (GVWR of 26,000 lbs or more) are
          limited to a maximum speed of 65 MPH.
          2.2.1.2. (Added-90MW) High Mobility Multi-Purpose                   Wheeled     Vehicles
          (HMMWV & UA-HMMWV) are limited to 55 MPH.
          2.2.1.3. (Added-90MW) All other vehicles will obey posted interstate highway
          speed limits or as specified by Technical Order.
   2.3. SF Teams responding to a real world Covered Wagon, Helping Hand, In-Field
   Response, Back-up Force, or emergency situation involving life or limb are authorized to
   exceed 25 MPH on gravel/dirt roads, as directed by local wing policy. Response to
   emergency situations does not automatically give the driver the “right of way.” Drivers retain
   accountability for safe travel, regardless of response priorities.
3. Operational Risk Management (ORM). A unit-managed, formalized ORM decision-
making process will be conducted for every vehicle movement to/from/within the missile
complex. Mitigators will be implemented to offset high-risk situations. For example, choosing
 4                                                 20AFI91-1_90MWSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


to reduce speed or swap to a more experienced driver during inclement weather conditions would
be examples of mitigators. Some factors to be considered in the ORM process are:
     3.1. Vehicle operator’s driving experience (month/years)
     3.2. Vehicle operator’s driving history (tickets, accident, mishaps, etc.)
     3.3. Geographic driving experience (e.g. southern or northern states)
     3.4. Driving experience on gravel roads (month/years)
     3.5. Driving experience on winter road conditions (months/years)
     3.6. Vehicle operator’s age
     3.7. Vehicle operator’s rest/sleep prior to driving
     3.8. Existing and forecasted weather (to include wind speed)
     3.9. Vehicle type
     3.10. Road condition
     3.11. Travel distance
     3.12. Hours on duty prior to trip departure
     3.13. Day or night travel
     3.14. Familiarity with the area to be traversed (flight, squadron, etc.)
     3.15. Other factors as directed by local policy
     3.16. (Added-90MW) Primary responsibility for accomplishing Operational Risk
     Management rests with the respective squadron commander. The owning squadron
     commander has the best knowledge of personnel, equipment, and mission and is in the best
     position to balance risk against benefit. For all Transportation Control Center (TCC)
     operations and vehicle operations within and outside the missile field complex refer to 20
     AFI 24-301 and the 90th MW supplement.
     3.17. (Added-90MW) The Driver’s Risk Assessment (DRA) process is designed to help
     vehicle crews and their supervisors identify and mitigate risks inherent in missile complex
     travel. It is a two-part process consisting of a Baseline Personal Risk Assessment (BPRA)
     and a real-time Driver Risk Assessment (DRA). Baseline Personal Risk Assessment’s
     should be reviewed/updated annually.
        3.17.1. (Added-90MW) Upon assignment to a unit, all personnel will complete a BPRA
        worksheet that factors age, driving experience, missile complex driving experience, bad
        weather driving experience and driving history (Attachment 2). NOTE: BPRA worksheet
        should be re-accomplished as driver skill improves or as directed by the supervisor to
        factor recent vehicle accidents/tickets.
        3.17.2. (Added-90MW) The BPRA score determines the color of the personal DRA
        card issued to the driver. Supervisors can then use the DRA card to identify high risk
        operators (Attachment 3).
20AFI91-1_90MWSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                                 5


      3.17.3. (Added-90MW) For all personnel issued a red DRA card, travel release will be
      determined by the functional supervisor (the first line supervisor in the field) rather than
      the individual even under the most favorable conditions.
   3.18. (Added-90MW) Prior to every vehicle movement or leg of the trip and when
   conditions change, vehicle crews will complete a real-time risk assessment using their
   personal DRA card.
      3.18.1. (Added-90MW) The DRA card identifies seven risk areas to be considered:
      Travel Conditions (which include weather), distance, hours on duty, vehicle type, area
      familiarity, other factors, and fatigue. For each of these areas, conditions are specified
      with associated risk values. The risk values for all conditions pertaining at the time of
      travel are totaled and added to the “personal number” to obtain a risk score. This score
      determines the trip release authority (risk decision) level for that trip.
      3.18.2. (Added-90MW) In addition to each of the risk areas discussed in 3.18.1., high
      risk conditions are identified as “shaded areas” on the DRA card. If any of the shaded
      areas apply, the vehicle crew will request instructions from their supervisor before
      beginning the dispatch.
      3.18.3. (Added-90MW) If unit leadership considers the DRA score is high,
      commanders & supervisors will review/evaluate options to lower the score and mitigate
      the risk for the team (e.g., change drivers, select a different vehicle type, select a different
      route, delay/accelerate trip departure). The DRA process is not an end in itself and does
      not substitute for sound professional judgment on the part of the driver or supervisor. It
      is only one tool to assist personnel in identifying and mitigating potential risk.
4. Additional Safety Requirements.
   4.1. The senior occupant, though not necessarily the driver, in SF vehicles will, to the
   greatest extent possible, be at least an E-4.
   4.2. The center front seat will only be occupied if all other available seats are filled.
   4.3. All passengers, regardless of rank, seniority or position will ensure safe procedures are
   practiced and seat belts are worn.
   4.4. Report all vehicle mishaps IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports and
   applicable supplements.
   4.5. Rollover mishaps will be briefed to the 20 AF/CC, within 30 days of occurrence. A
   rollover is defined as any Air Force vehicle, moving on or off-base, which, in the course of a
   single vehicle mishap, rolls onto its side, its top, or rolls 360 degrees or more and comes to
   rest on its wheels. Vehicles designated as Gravel Road Trainers are exempted from this
   requirement when performing their training mission.
   4.6. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has published numerous warnings
   about the rollover risk of 15-passenger vans. To mitigate the risk associated with this type
   vehicle, the following safety restrictions apply when operating government 15-passenger
   vans:
      4.6.1. Vans will not be operated with more than nine personnel (includes driver).
      4.6.2. Do not operate the van at a speed greater than 55 MPH under any circumstances.
 6                                              20AFI91-1_90MWSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


        4.6.3. All seat belts (lap and shoulder) will be worn when the vehicle is in motion.
        4.6.4. Only experienced personnel who have received hands-on familiarization training
        and understand the driving and loading characteristics of 15-passenger vans will be
        allowed to operate such vehicles. Personnel designated to drive 15-passenger vans must
        have the qualification annotated on their government driver’s license (AF Form 2293
        with management code B192). In addition, the National Highway Traffic Safety
        Administration warning/safety brief must be completed and annotated on the member’s
        AF Form 55 and on the AF Form 171.
5. Team Chief Responsibilities.
     5.1. The team chief will check Travel Conditions prior to trip departure, including departures
     from Missile Alert Facilities (MAFs) or Launch Facilities (LFs) in the missile complex. The
     team chief will ensure the appropriate risk management assessment has been performed and
     the appropriate approval level and leadership review has been conducted prior to departure.
     The team chief will ensure vehicle operator’s responsibilities identified in paragraph 1 have
     been accomplished.
     5.2. Ensure all teams dispatch with a copy of the Travel Condition chart (20AFI 24-301,
     Atch 1).
6. Driver’s Training.
     6.1. There are six types of driver’s training required for personnel who drive in the missile
     field complex. They are Driver’s Safety, Vehicle Orientation and Operation, Vehicle Crew
     Concept, SkidCar, Gravel Road and Route Familiarization.
        6.1.1. Driver’s Safety training. All personnel will attend driver’s safety training. This
        training will emphasize driving conditions, proper risk assessment (pre-dispatch and
        trans-dispatch), proper vehicle inspection, emergencies, radio-use, and instructions and
        policies within this instruction and local directives governing missile complex travel.
        6.1.2. Vehicle Orientation and Operation training. Each organization will conduct a
        driver-training program for each individual on those vehicles that the individual will
        operate. This training can be tailored to the driver’s experience and unit driver training
        requirements. Vehicle driver training in inclement weather is an essential element for
        drivers to learn and gain experience on how to handle vehicles in such conditions.
        Training in inclement weather can only occur after proper coordination between the
        squadron commander and group commander. Training should not be conducted in TC
        RED.
        6.1.3. VCC training. All personnel who dispatch to the missile field complex will
        receive this training IAW paragraph 1.2.
        6.1.4. SkidCar and Gravel Road training. All personnel who drive GMVs in the missile
        field complex will complete this training within 90 days of initial assignment to 90 MW,
        91 MW or 341 MW unless they have documented proof of attending the class at another
        20 AF wing.
            6.1.4.1. No missile field complex vehicle operator will receive a government vehicle
            license until the individual has completed skid car and gravel road training.
20AFI91-1_90MWSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                           7


         6.1.4.2. All personnel under 24 years of age, who drive in the missile field complex
         will receive annual skid car and gravel road training.
             6.1.4.2.1. (Added-90MW) Vehicle Control Officers/NCOs (VCO/VCNCO) will
             annotate skid monster and gravel road training (GRT) on the AF IMT 171,
             Request for Driver's Training and Addition to U.S. Government Drivers License
             before sending a driver to 90 LRS for issue of a government license.
             Organizations will also ensure recurring training directed by 20 AFI 91-1 para
             6.1.4.2. is current before forwarding the AF IMT 171 to 90 LRS.
             6.1.4.2.2. (Added-90MW) For persons who require a government license but do
             not dispatch to the missile complex, the VCO/VCNCO will annotate that
             information on the AF IMT 171.
             6.1.4.2.3. (Added-90MW) In addition to normal GRT, personnel (driver & front
             seat passenger) who will operate vehicles of GVWR 26,000 lbs or more in the
             missile field will complete heavy GRT training. Criteria is the same as normal
             Skid/GRT training (20 AFI 91-1, para 6.1.4.).
     6.1.5. Route Familiarization training. This training should, to the greatest extent
     possible, include driver’s familiarization of the missile flight area and should be
     performed on a regular basis.
  6.2. For mission-related dispatches, no operator or front seat passenger will use a vehicle in
  the missile field complex until they complete Driver’s Safety, Vehicle Orientation and
  Operation, Vehicle Crew Concept, SkidCar, Gravel Road and Route Familiarization.
     6.2.1. Squadron Commanders may document the inability of a front seat passenger to
     meet this requirement in a signed memorandum that states the reasons for the shortfall
     (maintenance issues, weather, etc.) and a suspense for the member to complete the
     required training. The duration for this memorandum will not exceed 6 months from
     initial assignment to 90 MW, 91 MW or 341 MW. During the period the member is
     under the memorandum, they may sit in the front seat and perform the required duties of
     the front seat passenger but this does not give them a waiver to operate a GMV. The
     group commander will endorse each memorandum indicating his/her acceptance of the
     risk to allow the individual to perform duties as a front seat passenger.
     6.2.2. Senior personnel accomplishing orientation-only dispatches may take
     distinguished visitors and newly-arrived personnel to the ICBM complex as front seat
     passengers. These passengers are exempt from the provisions in paragraph 6.1.
     6.2.3. The Missile Wing commander has discretion to permit missile complex travel for
     visiting personnel/teams who lack training/certification required by 20 AFI 91-1,
     paragraph 6.1.
         6.2.3.1. Visiting personnel/teams are responsible for adhering to all provisions of
         20AFI 91-1 (e.g., operational risk management, travel conditions, speed limits, etc.)
         and will abide by direction for travel in paragraph 6.4.
  6.3. Wing Safety will use 20 AF standardized lesson plans to develop local lesson plans for
  SkidCar and Gravel Road training and will develop local vehicle crew concept training.
  Wing safety will provide these lesson plans and any updates to the affected organizations.
 8                                              20AFI91-1_90MWSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


     Wing ground safety staffs will train/certify all instructors on the gravel road academic
     curriculum, vehicle and course. SkidCar training will be accomplished IAW training
     received from the parent company of the SKidCar kit. Experienced trainers outside the
     safety office may certify other instructors with prior authorization of Wing Safety.
        6.3.1. (Added-90MW) Personnel appointed by their unit as skid monster/gravel road
        instructors will meet the following minimum requirements.
            6.3.1.1. (Added-90MW) Satisfactorily completed all driver's training requirements
            in 20 AFI 91-1, para 6. and sub-paragraphs.
            6.3.1.2. (Added-90MW) Have at least two years of civilian driving experience and
            possess a civilian as well as a government driver's license.
            6.3.1.3. (Added-90MW) Possess a green DRA card.
            6.3.1.4. (Added-90MW) Be at least a Senior Airman with two years missile field
            driving experience or at least a O-1 with one year missile field driving experience.
        6.3.2. (Added-90MW) During instructor certification, 90 MW/SE will demonstrate all
        steps of the skid monster/gravel road course curriculum. Each prospective instructor

        of 90 MW/SE, and will only be re-certified with the approval of the Chief of Safety or the
        Ground Safety Manager.
     6.4. Organizations are responsible for the training of their personnel on Gravel Road and

                     BASELINE PERSONAL RISK ASSESSMENT (BPRA)

This assessment is used to determine a risk number that will help guide the supervisor's selection of a per-
sonal Driver Risk Assessment (DRA) card for each missile field driver. The process will only work with
total and honest disclosure by the person being assessed. Therefore, supervisors and commanders should
consider this assessment a non-attributive interview and must assure the privacy of the driver.
