C1.1. REFERENCES

       C1.1.1. References (see pages 2 and 3, above)

C1.2. PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

        C1.2.1. Purpose. This Regulation provides policies and procedures for the DoD implementation
of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552, as amended) and DoD Directive 5400.7 (references
(a) and (b)), and promotes uniformity in the DoD Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program.

        C1.2.1. (AF) This supplement implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 37-1, Air Force
Information Management (will convert to AFPD 33-3), and applies to all Air Force activities. It provides
policies and procedures for implementing Title 5 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 552, Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA), as amended, and For Official Use Only (FOUO) information requirements. In
the case of a conflict, this supplement takes precedence over any Air Force publication that addresses
disclosure of Air Force records to the public. Commands may not change the basic procedures in this
supplement. Send copies of major command (MAJCOM), field operating agency (FOA), and direct
reporting unit (DRU) supplements to (AF-CIO/P, 1155 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-
1155. Use of the term “MAJCOM” throughout this supplement includes MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs.
Refer recommended changes or comments to Headquarters Air Force Communications Agency (HQ
AFCA/ITPP), 203 W. Losey Street, Room 1100, Scott AFB IL 62225- 5222, through appropriate
channels, using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, with an information copy to
AF-CIO/P.

               C1.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) Summary of Revisions. This change incorporates interim change
(IC) 2002-1 (Attachment 1). It moves responsibility for the Air Force FOIA Program from HQ
USAF/SC to AF-CIO; updates Government Information Locator Service (GILS) links; changes the
number of FOIA requests to be considered frequently requested from 5 to 3, and updates organizational
addresses, and office symbols..

         C1.2.2. Applicability. This Regulation applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD),
the Military Departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Combatant Commands, the
Inspector General of the Department of Defense (IG DoD), the Defense Agencies, and the DoD Field
Activities (hereafter referred to collectively as “the DoD Components”). This Regulation takes prece-
dence over all DoD Component publications that supplement and implement the DoD FOIA Program. A
list of DOD Components is at Appendix AP6.

       C1.2.2. (AF) A list of Air Force MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs is at Appendix 2.

C1.3. DOD PUBLIC INFORMATION

       C1.3.1. Public Information.

             C1.3.1.1. The public has a right to information concerning the activities of its
Government. DoD policy is to conduct its activities in an open manner and provide the public with a
maximum amount of accurate and timely information concerning its activities, consistent always with
                                                  13
the legitimate public and private interests of the American people. A record requested by a member of
the public who follows rules established by proper authority in the Department of Defense shall not be
withheld in whole or in part unless the record is exempt from mandatory partial or total disclosure under
the FOIA. As a matter of policy, DoD Components shall make discretionary disclosures of exempt
records or information whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA
exemption, but this policy does not create any right enforceable in court. In order that the public may
have timely information concerning DoD activities, records requested through public information
channels by news media representatives that would not be withheld if requested under the FOIA should
be released upon request. Prompt responses to requests for information from news media representatives
should be encouraged to eliminate the need for these requesters to invoke the provisions of the FOIA
and thereby assist in providing timely information to the public. Similarly, requests from other members
of the public for information that would not be withheld under the FOIA should continue to be honored
through appropriate means without requiring the requester to invoke the FOIA.

                C1.3.1.1. (AF) Functional Requests. Air Force elements may receive requests for
government information or records from the public that do not refer to the FOIA. Often these requests
are sent to a public affairs office (PAO) or a specific unit. All releases of information from Air Force
records, whether the requester cites the FOIA or not, must comply with the principles of the FOIA and
this supplement. If the requested material contains personal privacy information that the Air Force must
withhold, it is particularly important to handle that “functional” request as a request under the FOIA and
coordinate it with the appropriate FOIA office and an Air Force attorney. Regardless of the nature of the
functional request, if the responding element denies the release of information from Air Force records,
then control the request as a FOIA and follow FOIA denial procedures for records withheld (cite the
pertinent FOIA exemption and give the requester FOIA appeal rights).

               C1.3.1.2. Within the OSD, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control,
Communications, and Intelligence, as Chief Information Officer, in conjunction with the Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, is responsible for ensuring preparation of reference material or a
guide for requesting records or information from the Department of Defense, subject to the nine
exemptions of the FOIA. This publication shall also include an index of all major information systems,
and a description of major information and record locator systems, as defined by the Office of the
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence. DoD FOIA
Components shall coordinate with the appropriate office(s) to insure that this is also accomplished
within their department or organization.

               C1.3.1.3. DoD Components shall also prepare, in addition to normal FOIA regulations, a
handbook for the use of the public in obtaining information from their organization. This handbook
should be a short, simple explanation to the public of what the FOIA is designed to do, and how a
member of the public can use it to access government records. Each DoD Component should explain the
types of records that can be obtained through FOIA requests, why some records cannot, by law, be made
available, and how the DoD Component determines whether the record can be released. The handbook
should also explain how to make a FOIA request, how long the requester can expect to wait for a reply,
and explain the right of appeal. The handbook should supplement other information locator systems,
such as the Government Information Locator Service (GILS), and explain how a requester can obtain
more information about those systems. The handbook should be available on paper and through
electronic means and contain the following additional information, complete with electronic links to the
below elements; the location of reading room(s) within the Component and the types and categories of
information available, the location of Component’s World Wide Web page, a reference to the
Component’s FOIA regulation and how to obtain a copy, a reference to the Component’s FOIA annual
                                                    14
report and how to obtain a copy and the location of the Component’s GILS page. Also, the DoD
Components’ Freedom of Information Act Annual Reports should refer to the handbook and how to
obtain it.

               C1.3.1.3. (AF) AF-CIO/P will make the Air Force handbook and guide for requesting
records available on the World Wide Web (WWW) from Air ForceLINK, at
http://www.foia.af.mil/handbook1.shtml.

        C1.3.2. Control System. A request for records that invokes the FOIA shall enter a formal control
system designed to ensure accountability and compliance with the FOIA. Any request for DoD records
that either explicitly or implicitly cites the FOIA shall be processed under the provisions of this
Regulation, unless otherwise required by subsection C1.5.13 below.

C1.4. DEFINITIONS

       C1.4.1. Definitions. As used in this Regulation, the following terms and meanings shall be
applicable:

        C1.4.1. (AF) Electronic Reading Room. Rooms established on internet web sites for public
access to FOIA (a)(2)(D) records.

        C1.4.2. FOIA Request. A written request for DoD records that reasonably describes the
record(s) sought, made by any person, including a member of the public (U.S. or foreign citizen/entity),
an organization, or a business, but not including a Federal Agency or a fugitive from the law, that either
explicitly or implicitly invokes the FOIA, DoD Directive 5400.7 (reference (b)), this Regulation, or DoD
Component supplementing regulations or instructions. Requesters should also indicate a willingness to
pay fees associated with the processing of their request or, in the alternative, why a waiver of fees may
be appropriate. Written requests may be received by postal service or other commercial delivery means,
by facsimile, or electronically. Requests received by facsimile or electronically must have a postal
mailing address included since it may not be practical to provide a substantive response electronically.
The request is considered properly received, or perfected, when the above conditions have been met and
the request arrives at the FOIA office of the Component in possession of the records.

        C1.4.2. (AF) This includes FOIA requests made by members of Congress either on their own
behalf or on behalf of one of their constituents. Process FOIA requests from members of Congress in
accordance with this Air Force supplement. Air Force-affiliated requesters, to include military and
civilian employees, should not use government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage, telephones, or
official mail channels to make FOIA requests.

       C1.4.2. (AMC) Even if a requester agrees to accept only releasable portions of a record,
process Security Forces Reports of Investigation (ROI), Equal Opportunity and Treatment (EOT)
Investigations, Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Investigations, Inspector General (IG)
Investigations and/or records, Commander Directed Investigations (CDI), Family Advocacy files,
or any other investigative records under both the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA).

              C1.4.2.1. (Added)(AF) Simple requests can be processed quickly with limited impact on
the responding units. The request clearly identifies the records with no (or few) complicating factors
involved. There are few or no responsive records. Only one installation is involved and there are no
outside OPRs. There are no classified or nongovernment records. No deliberative process/privileged
                                                     15
materials are involved. The responsive records contain no (or limited) personal privacy information and
do not come from a Privacy Act system of records. No time extensions are anticipated.

             C1.4.2.1. (AMC) Simple requests include: releases, referrals, no records, requests
withdrawn, fee-related reasons, records not reasonably described, not a proper FOIA request, not
an agency record, duplicate request, etc.

              C1.4.2.2. (Added)(AF) Complex requests take substantial time and cause significant
impact on responding units. Complications and delays are likely. Records sought are massive in volume.
Multiple organizations must review/coordinate on requested records. Records are classified; originated
with a nongovernment source; are part of the Air Force’s decision-making process; or are privileged.

                C1.4.2.2. (AMC) Complex requests are those that require substantial time to
process, i.e., contracts, denial/partial denials, large volume of records to review, etc.

       C1.4.3. Agency Record.

                C1.4.3.1. The products of data compilation, such as all books, papers, maps, and
photographs, machine readable materials, inclusive of those in electronic form or format, or other
documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of
the United States Government under Federal law in connection with the transaction of public business
and in Department of Defense possession and control at the time the FOIA request is made. Care should
be taken not to exclude records from being considered agency records, unless they fall within one of the
categories of the subparagraph C1.4.3.2, below.

               C1.4.3.2. The following are not included within the definition of the word "record":

                        C1.4.3.2.1. Objects or articles, such as structures, furniture, vehicles and
equipment, whatever their historical value, or value as evidence.

                        C1.4.3.2.2. Anything that is not a tangible or documentary record, such as an
individual's memory or oral communication.

                          C1.4.3.2.3. Personal records of an individual not subject to agency creation or
retention requirements, created and maintained primarily for the convenience of an agency employee,
and not distributed to other agency employees for their official use. Personal papers fall into three
categories: those created before entering Government service; private materials brought into, created, or
received in the office that were not created or received in the course of transacting Government
business; and work-related personal papers that are not used in the transaction of Government business
(see reference (c)).

                C1.4.3.3. A record must exist and be in the possession and control of the Department of
Defense at the time of the request to be considered subject to this Regulation and the FOIA. There is no
obligation to create, compile, or obtain a record to satisfy a FOIA request. See paragraph C1.5.7.2.,
below on creating a record in the electronic environment.

               C1.4.3.4. Hard copy or electronic records, that are subject to FOIA requests under 5
U.S.C. 552 (a)(3) (reference (a)), and that are available to the public through an established distribution
system, or through the Federal Register, the National Technical Information Service, or the Internet,
normally need not be processed under the provisions of the FOIA. If a request is received for such
                                                     16
information, DoD Components shall provide the requester with guidance, inclusive of any written notice
to the public, on how to obtain the information. However, if the requester insists that the request be
processed under the FOIA, then the request shall be processed under the FOIA. If there is any doubt as
to whether the request must be processed, contact the Directorate for Freedom of Information and
Security Review.

              C1.4.3.4. (AF) Refer to C1.5.9.9. for procedures when request ing records from the
National Technical Information Service (NTIS) or Government Printing Office (GPO).

       C1.4.4. DoD Component. An element of the Department of Defense, as defined in subsection
C1.2.2, above, authorized to receive and act independently on FOIA requests. (See Appendix AP6.) A
DoD Component has its own initial denial authority (IDA), appellate authority, and legal counsel.

                 C1.4.4.1. (Added)(AF) Government Information Locator Service (GILS). GILS is an
automated on-line card catalog of publicly accessible information. The Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Bulletin 95-01, 7 December 1994, and OMB Memorandum, 6 February 1998, mandates
that all federal agencies create a GILS record for information available to the public. Within DoD, GILS
is referred to as the DoD Resource Locator and may be found at http://sites.defenselink.mil.

        C1.4.5. Initial Denial Authority (IDA). An official who has been granted authority by the head of
a DoD component to withhold records requested under the FOIA for one or more of the nine categories
of records exempt from mandatory disclosure. IDA’s may also deny a fee category claim by a requester;
deny a request for expedited processing due to demonstrated compelling need under paragraph C1.5.4.3,
below, of this Regulation; deny a request for a waiver or reduction of fees; review a fee estimate; and
confirm that no records were located in response to a request.

         C1.4.5. (AF) Only approved IDAs may deny all or parts of records. FOIA managers may:
initially deny fee category claims, requests for expedited processing, and waiver or reduction of fees;
review fee estimates; and sign “no records” responses. IDAs are the deputy chiefs of staff and chiefs of
comparable offices or higher at HQ USAF and Secretary of the Air Force (SAF), and MAJCOM
commanders. MAJCOM commanders may appoint two additional positions at the headquarters and also
the wing commander at base level. MAJCOM inspectors general (IG) and MAJCOM Directors of
Inquiries (IGQ) may act as IDAs for IG records. MAJCOM FOIA managers must notify AF-CIO/P in
writing (by facsimile, e-mail, or regular mail) of IDA position titles. Send position titles only--no names.
AF-CIO/P provides SAF/IGQ a courtesy copy of correspondence designating IDA positions for IG
records. When the commander changes the IDA designee position, MAJCOM FOIA managers advise
AF-CIO/P immediately. In the absence of the designated IDA, the individual filling/assuming that
position acts as an IDA, however; all denial documentation must reflect the position title of the approved
or designated IDA, even if in an acting capacity (i.e., Acting Director of Communications and
Information, Headquarters Air Combat Command).

      C1.4.5. (AMC) Chief, Operations Division (HQ AMC/A6O) is designated the initial denial
authority (IDA) for the Air Mobility Command when the A6O is a pinned O-6 or above.
Otherwise, the Deputy Director of Communications (HQ AMC/DA6) will sign as the denial
authority.

               C1.4.5.1. (Added)(AF) Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). A DoD element that
either prepared, or is responsible for, records identified as responsive to a FOIA request. OPRs


                                                    17
coordinate with the office of corollary responsibility (OCR) and FOIA managers to assist IDAs in
making decisions on FOIA requests.

                 C1.4.5.1. (AMC) The base wing commander is appointed as the initial denial
authority over the following types of requests: (1) for lists of names of personnel (military or
civilian), e.g., personnel assigned to the base, personnel separating, in-bound and out-bound
personnel, lists of contracting officers, etc; (2) for “lists” of names of government-wide purchase
card holders; (3) for maps depicting base housing addresses in base telephone books; (4) for a list
of quarters addresses, with or without resident’s names; (5) for names contained in organizational
charts or similar records that show the structure of base organizations; (6) for names and other
personal information, contained in Security Forces blotters and minor accident reports, not
involving injury; and (7) government e-mail addresses on contracts (signatures on contracts are
releasable). Note: These types of requests can be processed at the base level and should not be
forwarded to the HQ AMC FOIA office.

                C1.4.5.2. (Added)(AF) OCR. A DoD element with an official interest in, and/or collateral
responsibility for, the contents of records identified as responsive to a FOIA request, even though those
records were either prepared by, or are the primary responsibility of, a different DoD element. OCRs
coordinate with OPRs and FOIA managers to assist IDAs in making decisions on FOIA requests.

       C1.4.6. Appellate Authority. The Head of the DoD Component or the Component head's
designee having jurisdiction for this purpose over the record, or any of the other adverse determinations
outlined in subsections C1.4.5, above, and C1.4.7, below.

       C1.4.6. (AF) The SAF has designated the Deputy General Counsel, Fiscal, Ethics, and Civilian
Personnel (SAF/GCA) as the FOIA appellate authority.

        C1.4.7. Administrative Appeal. A request by a member of the general public, made under the
FOIA, asking the appellate authority of a DoD Component to reverse a decision: to withhold all or part
of a requested record; to deny a fee category claim by a requester; to deny a request for waiver or
reduction of fees; to deny a request to review an initial fee estimate; to deny a request for expedited
processing due to demonstrated compelling need under paragraph C1.5.4.3, below, of this Regulation; to
confirm that no records were located during the initial search. Requesters also may appeal the failure to
receive a response determination within the statutory time limits, and any determination that the
requester believes is adverse in nature.

         C1.4.8. Public Interest. The interest in obtaining official information that sheds light on an
agency's performance of its statutory duties because the information falls within the statutory purpose of
the FOIA to inform citizens about what their Government is doing. That statutory purpose, however, is
not fostered by disclosure of information about private citizens accumulated in various governmental
files that reveals nothing about an agency's or official's own conduct.

        C1.4.9. Electronic Record. Records (including e-mail) that are created, stored, and retrievable by
electronic means.

       C1.4.10. Federal Agency. As defined by 5 U.S.C. 552 (f)(1) (reference (a)), a Federal agency is
any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled
corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive
Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.

                                                    18
       C1.4.11. (Added)(AF) Reading Room. Any place where a member of the public may view FOIA
records.

C1.5. POLICY

        C1.5.1. Compliance with the FOIA. DoD personnel are expected to comply with the FOIA, this
Regulation, and DoD FOIA policy in both letter and spirit. This strict adherence is necessary to provide
uniformity in the implementation of the DoD FOIA Program and to create conditions that will promote
public trust.

        C1.5.2. Openness with the Public. The Department of Defense shall conduct its activities in an
open manner consistent with the need for security and adherence to other requirements of law and
regulation. Records not exempt from disclosure under the Act shall, upon request, be made readily
accessible to the public in accordance with rules promulgated by competent authority, whether or not the
Act is invoked.

        C1.5.3. Avoidance of Procedural Obstacles. DoD Components shall ensure that procedural
matters do not unnecessarily impede a requester from obtaining DoD records promptly. Components
shall provide assistance to requesters to help them understand and comply with procedures established
by this Regulation and any supplemental regulations published by the DoD Components.

        C1.5.3. (AF) Responsibilities. The Air Force Chief Information Officer (AF-CIO) has overall
responsibility for the Air Force FOIA Program. The Plans and Policy Directorate (AF-CIO/P)
administers the procedures necessary to implement the Air Force FOIA Program, submits reports to
Director, Freedom of Information and Security Review (DFOISR), and provides guidance and
instructions to MAJCOMs. Responsibilities of other Air Force elements follow.

               C1.5.3.1. (Added)(AF) SAF/GCA makes final decisions on FOIA administrative appeals.

               C1.5.3.2. (Added)(AF) Installation commanders will:

                         C1.5.3.2.1. (Added)(AF) Comply with FOIA electronic reading room (ERR)
requirements by establishing a FOIA site on their installation public web page and making frequently
requested records [FOIA (a)(2)(D)] records available through links from that site, with a link to the Air
Force FOIA web page at http://www.foia.af.mil. See paragraph C2.1.2.4.2.2.

              C1.5.3.3. (Added)(AF) MAJCOM commanders implement this instruction in their
commands and agencies and appoint a FOIA manager in writing. Send the name, phone number, office
symbol, and e-mail address to AF-CIO/P, 1155 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1155.

               C1.5.3.4. (Added)(AF) Air Force attorneys review FOIA responses for legal sufficiency,
provide legal advice to OPRs, disclosure authorities, IDAs, and FOIA managers, and provide written
legal opinions when responsive records (or portions of responsive records) are withheld. Air Force
attorneys ensure factual and legal issues raised by appellants are considered by IDAs prior to sending the
FOIA appeal files to the Secretary of the Air Force’s designee for final action.

                 C1.5.3.5. (Added)(AF) Disclosure authorities and IDAs apply the policies and guidance
in this instruction, along with the written recommendations provided by staff elements, when
considering what decisions to make on pending FOIA actions. Where any responsive records are denied,
the IDA tells the requesters the nature of records or information denied, the FOIA exemption supporting
                                                    19
the denial, the reasons the records were not released, and gives the requester the appeal procedures. In
addition, on partial releases, IDAs must ensure requesters can see the placement and general length of
redactions with the applicable exemption indicated. This procedure applies to all media, including
electronic records. Providing placement and general length of redacted information is not required if
doing so would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. When working FOIA appeal actions
for the appellate authority review:

                           C1.5.3.5.1 (Added)(AF) IDAs grant or recommend continued denial (in full or
in part) of the requester’s appeal of the earlier withholding of responsive records, or adverse
determination (for example, IDAs may release some or all of the previously denied documents).

                       C1.5.3.5.2. (Added)(AF) IDAs reassess a request for expedited processing due
to demonstrated compelling need, overturning or confirming the initial determination made by the FOIA
manager.

                            C1.5.3.5.3. (Added)(AF) When an IDA denies any appellate action sought by a
FOIA requester, the IDA, or MAJCOM FOIA manager (for no record, fee, fee estimates, or fee category
appeals) will indicate in writing that the issues raised in the FOIA appeal were considered and rejected
(in full or in part). Include this written statement in the file you send to the Secretary of the Air Force in
the course of a FOIA appeal action. Send all appeal actions through the MAJCOM FOIA office.

               C1.5.3.6. (Added)(AF) OPRs:

                          C1.5.3.6.1. (Added)(AF) Coordinate the release or denial of records requested
under the FOIA with OCRs, FOIA offices, and with Air Force attorneys on proposed denials.
C1.5.3.6.2. (Added)(AF) Provide requested records. Indicate withheld parts of records annotated with
FOIA exemption. Ensure requesters can see the placement and general length of redactions. This
procedure applies to all media, including electronic records. Providing placement and general length of
redacted information is not required if doing so would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption.

                          C1.5.3.6.1. (AMC) OPRs will coordinate recommendations for release, as
well as denial of records, with Air Force attorneys. Releases only require legal coordination and
not a full legal analysis. Denials require a full legal analysis.

                         C1.5.3.6.2. (Added)(AF) Provide requested records. Indicate withheld parts of
records annotated with FOIA exemption. Ensure requesters can see the placement and general length of
redactions. This procedure applies to all media, including electronic records. Providing placement and
general length of redacted information is not required if doing so would harm an interest protected by a
FOIA exemption.

                       C1.5.3.6.2. (AMC) OPRs will copy all two-sided documents to single-sided
prior to marking the portions recommended for denial/partial denial with a yellow highlighter.
(Do not black out information). HQ AMC/JAAC will use a blue highlighter to differentiate
between their recommendations and the base recommendations. Forward one yellow highlighted
single-sided copy and one single-sided clean copy to the HQ AMC FOIA office as part of FOIA
package. Approved redacting software may be used instead of highlighting.

                        C1.5.3.6.3. (Added)(AF) Provide written recommendations to the disclosure
authority to determine whether or not to release records, and act as declassification authority when
appropriate.
                                                    20
                           C1.5.3.6.4. (Added)(AF) Make frequently requested records [FOIA (a)(2)(D)]
available to the public in the FOIA ERR via the internet. As required by AFIs 33-129, Transmission of
Information Via the Internet, and 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures, OPRs request
clearance of these records with the PAO before posting on the WWW, and coordinate with JA and FOIA
office prior to posting. The FOIA manager, in coordination with the functional OPR or the owner of the
records, will determine qualifying records, after coordination with any interested OCRs.

                         C1.5.3.6.5. (Added)(AF) Complete the required GILS core record for each
FOIA (a)(2)(D) record.

                           C1.5.3.6.6. (Added)(AF) Manage ERR records posted to the installation public
web page by updating or removing them when no longer needed. Software for tracking number of hits
may assist in this effort.

               C1.5.3.7. (Added)(AF) FOIA managers:

              C1.5.3.7. (AMC) Base Record Managers are designated as the FOIA manager for
their base. They are responsible for sending denial/partial denial case files to HQ AMC/A6OBR
(FOIA), using the sample letter at Appendix 13. Forward the original of all administrative
documents in the FOIA case file, to include, the tasking letter, the OPR's response, the base legal
review, and other processing documents. Send a copy of the responsive record, not the original.
Forward all case files via first class mail. When necessary, use overnight services to expedite
delivery. Advise the requester of this transfer. FOIA managers have the option to scan the FOIA
package and place it on the official records drive, then notify the MAJCOM FOIA Manager of the
pending FOIA.

                         C1.5.3.7.1. (Added)(AF) Ensure administrative correctness of all FOIA actions
processed.

                                    C1.5.3.7.1.1. (Added)(AF) Control and process FOIA requests.

                                C1.5.3.7.1.1. (AMC) FOIA Managers must use the ACC FOIA
Module (will revert to ACC web-based FOIA) to record receipt of FOIA requests for daily
tracking and monitoring purposes.

                                    C1.5.3.7.1.2. (Added)(AF) Obtain recommendations from the OPR
for records.

                               C1.5.3.7.1.2. (AMC) Use sample tasking letter at Appendix 14.
Give the OPR no more than 7 workdays to respond. Use AMC Form 13, FOIA Request, as a cover
sheet on all FOIA packages.

                                      C1.5.3.7.1.3. (Added)(AF) Prepare or coordinate on all proposed
replies to the requester. FOIA managers may sign replies to requesters when disclosure authorities
approve the total release of records. If the MAJCOM supplement directs the OPR to prepare the reply,
the OPR will coordinate their reply with the FOIA office.

                                  C1.5.3.7.1.3. (AMC) The FOIA manager will prepare all
responses to the requester. Responses will be coordinated through legal and signed by the
designated disclosure authority. HQ AMC/A6OBR will coordinate all FOIA requests with staff
                                                  21
agencies that help develop recommended courses of action for the commander. At a minimum,
these agencies will include HQ AMC/JA, HQ AMC/PA, and those offices holding the responsive
records.

                                      C1.5.3.7.1.4. (Added)(AF) Make determinations as to whether or
not the nature of requests are simple or complex where multitrack FOIA request processing queues exist.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.5. (Added)(AF) Approve or initially deny any requests
for expedited processing.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.6. (Added)(AF) Provide interim responses to requesters,
as required.

                                    C1.5.3.7.1.6. (AMC) Use applicable portions of the letter at
Appendix 15 to acknowledge receipt of FOIA requests, misdirected requests, and functional
requests logged in as a FOIA. Use sample letter at Appendix 16 to provide requester with status of
their request. Use sample letter at Appendix 17 when releasing records, assessing fees, providing
no record responses, and referring requests.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.7. (Added)(AF) Provide a reading room for inspecting
and copying records.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.8. (Added)(AF) Provide training.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.9. (Added)(AF) Review publications for compliance
with this supplement.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.10. (Added)(AF) Conduct periodic program reviews.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.11. (Added)(AF) Approve or deny initial fee waiver
requests.

                                    C1.5.3.7.1.11. (AMC) Use sample letter at Appendix 18 to
request justification for fee waiver. Use sample letter at Appendix 19 to deny fee waiver requests.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.12. (Added)(AF) Make the initial decision on chargeable
fees.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.13. (Added)(AF) Collect fees.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.14. (Added)(AF) Send extension notices.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.15. (Added)(AF) Submit reports.

                            C1.5.3.7.1.15. (AMC) FOIA managers will submit the annual
FOIA report to HQ AMC/ A6OBR by the 10th of October.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.16. (Added)(AF) Sign “no record” responses.

                                     C1.5.3.7.1.17. (Added)(AF) Provide the requester the basis for any
adverse determination (i.e., no records, fee denials, fee category determinations, etc.) in enough detail to
                                                     22
permit the requester to make a decision whether or not to appeal the actions taken, and provide the
requester with appeal procedures.

                                  C1.5.3.7.1.17. (AMC) When providing any adverse
determination, provide appeal rights. Use the following wording, "If you interpret our response to
be an adverse action, you may appeal it to the Secretary of the Air Force through our office at the
above address within 60 calendar days from the date of this letter. Include your reasons for
reconsideration and attach a copy of this letter."

                         C1.5.3.7.2. (Added)(AF) On appeals, FOIA managers:

                                    C1.5.3.7.2.1. (Added)(AF) Reassess a fee category claim by a
requester, overturning or confirming the initial determination.

                                  C1.5.3.7.2.2. (Added)(AF) Reassess a request for expedited
processing due to demonstrated compelling need, overturning or confirming the initial determination.

                                     C1.5.3.7.2.3. (Added)(AF) Reassess a request for a waiver or
reduction of fees, overturning or confirming the initial determination.

                                        C1.5.3.7.2.4. (Added)(AF) Review a fee estimate, overturning or
confirming the initial determination.

                                        C1.5.3.7.2.5. (Added)(AF) Confirm that no records were located in
response to a request.

                          C1.5.3.7.3. (Added)(AF) The base FOIA manager acts as the FOIA focal point
for the FOIA site on the installation web page.

                C1.5.3.8. (Added)(AF) When any appellate action sought by a FOIA requester is denied
by an IDA or FOIA manager for authorized actions, the IDA or FOIA manager will indicate, in writing,
that the issues raised in the FOIA appeal were considered and rejected (in full or in part). Include this
written statement in the file you send it to the Secretary of the Air Force in the course of a FOIA appeal
action. Send all appeal actions through the MAJCOM FOIA office.

               C1.5.3.8. (AMC) Forward all base-level appeals to HQ AMC/A6OBR for processing
to the appellate authority. Include all records as outlined in AP 9.5 of DOD 5400.7/AF SUP 1.

            C1.5.3.8.1. (Added) (AMC) HQ AMC/A6OBR will forward all appeals of previously
denied command-level FOIA requests to higher headquarters for resolution, unless the AMC
commander determines such action is unnecessary.

       C1.5.4. Prompt Action on Requests.

                C1.5.4.1. Generally, when a member of the public complies with the procedures
established in this Regulation and DoD Component regulations or instructions for obtaining DoD
records, and after the request is received by the official designated to respond, DoD Components shall
endeavor to provide a final response determination within the statutory 20 working days. If a significant
number of requests, or the complexity of the requests prevent a final response determination within the
statutory time period, DoD Components shall advise the requester of this fact, and explain how the
                                                      23
request will be responded to within its multitrack processing system (see subparagraph C1.5.4.2.,
below). A final response determination is notification to the requester that the records are released, or
will be released on a certain date, or the records are denied under the appropriate FOIA exemption, or
the records cannot be provided for one or more of the other reasons in subsection C5.2.2., below. Interim
responses acknowledging receipt of the request, negotiations with the requester concerning the scope of
the request, the response timeframe, and fee agreements are encouraged; however, such actions do not
constitute a final response determination pursuant to the FOIA. If a request fails to meet minimum
requirements as set forth in subsection C1.4.2., above, Components shall inform the requester how to
perfect or correct the request. The statutory 20 working day time limit applies upon receipt of a
perfected or correct FOIA request which complies with the requirements outlined in subsection C1.4.2.,
above.

               C1.5.4.1. (AF) Examples of letters to FOIA requesters (e.g., response determinations and
interim responses) are included in Appendix 7.

                C1.5.4.2. Multitrack Processing. When a Component has a significant number of pending
requests that prevents a response determination being made within 20 working days, the requests shall
be processed in a multitrack processing system, based on the date of receipt, the amount of work and
time involved in processing the requests, and whether the request qualifies for expedited processing as
described in paragraph C1.5.4.3., below. DoD Components may establish as many processing queues as
they wish; however, as a minimum, three processing tracks shall be established, all based on a first-in,
first-out concept, and rank ordered by the date of receipt of the request. One track shall be a processing
queue for simple requests, one track for complex requests, and one track shall be a processing queue for
expedited processing as described in paragraph C1.5.4.3, below. Determinations as to whether a request
is simple or complex shall be made by each DoD Component. DoD Components shall provide a
requester whose request does not qualify for the fastest queue (except for expedited processing as
described in paragraph C1.5.4.3, below), an opportunity to limit in writing by hard copy, facsimile, or
electronically, the scope of the request in order to qualify for the fastest queue. This multitrack
processing system does not obviate components’ responsibility to exercise due diligence in processing
requests in the most expeditious manner possible.

               C1.5.4.2. (AF) Examples of letters to FOIA requesters (e.g., letters to individuals who
have had their FOIA request placed in the complex track) are included in Appendix 7.

                          C1.5.4.2.1. (Added)(AF) Simple requests can be processed quickly, with
limited impact on the responding units. The request clearly identifies the records with no (or few)
complicating factors involved. There are few or no responsive records, only one installation is involved,
there are no outside OPRs, no classified or nongovernment records, no deliberative process/privileged
materials are involved, records contain no (or limited) personal privacy information/did not come from
Privacy Act systems of records concerning other individuals, or time extensions not anticipated.

                          C1.5.4.2.2. (Added)(AF) Complex requests will take substantial time, will
cause significant impact on responding units. Complications and delays are likely. Records sought are
massive in volume, multiple organizations must review/coordinate on records, records are classified,
records originated with a nongovernment source, records were part of the Air Force’s decision-making
process or are privileged.

               C1.5.4.3. Expedited Processing. A separate queue shall be established for requests
meeting the test for expedited processing. Expedited processing shall be granted to a requester after the

                                                    24
requester requests such and demonstrates a compelling need for the information. Notice of the
determination as to whether to grant expedited processing in response to a requester’s compelling need
shall be provided to the requester within 10 calendar days after receipt of the request in the DoD
Component’s office that will determine whether to grant expedited processing. Once the DoD
Component has determined to grant expedited processing, the request shall be processed as soon as
practicable. Actions by DoD Components to initially deny or affirm the initial denial on appeal of a
request for expedited processing, and failure to respond in a timely manner shall be subject to judicial
review

              C1.5.4.3. (AF) Examples of letters to individuals whose FOIA requests and/or appeals
were not expedited are included in Appendix 7.

                         C1.5.4.3.1. Compelling need means that the failure to obtain the records on an
expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of
an individual.

                         C1.5.4.3.2. Compelling need also means that the information is urgently needed
by an individual primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public
concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity. An individual primarily engaged in
disseminating information means a person whose primary activity involves publishing or otherwise
disseminating information to the public. Representatives of the news media (see paragraph C6.1.5.7.,
below) would normally qualify as individuals primarily engaged in disseminating information. Other
persons must demonstrate that their primary activity involves publishing or otherwise disseminating
information to the public.

                                        C1.5.4.3.2.1 Urgently needed means that the information has a
particular value that will be lost if not disseminated quickly. Ordinarily this means a breaking news story
of general public interest. However, information of historical interest only, or information sought for
litigation or commercial activities would not qualify, nor would a news media publication or broadcast
deadline unrelated to the news breaking nature of the information.

                          C1.5.4.3.3. A demonstration of compelling need by a requester shall be made
by a statement certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of their knowledge. This
statement must accompany the request in order to be considered and responded to within the 10 calendar
days required for decisions on expedited access.

                           C1.5.4.3.4. Other Reasons for Expedited Processing. Other reasons that merit
expedited processing by DoD Components are an imminent loss of substantial due process rights and
humanitarian need. A demonstration of imminent loss of substantial due process rights shall be made by
a statement certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge.
Humanitarian need means that disclosing the information will promote the welfare and interests of
mankind. A demonstration of humanitarian need shall be also made by a statement certified by the
requester to be true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge. Both statements mentioned above
must accompany the request in order to be considered and responded to within the 10 calendar days
required for decisions on expedited access. Once the decision has been made to expedite the request for
either of these reasons, the request may be processed in the expedited processing queue behind those
requests qualifying for compelling need.



                                                    25
                         C1.5.4.3.5. These same procedures also apply to requests for expedited
processing of administrative appeals.

        C1.5.5. Use of Exemptions. It is DoD policy to make records publicly available, unless the
record qualifies for exemption under one or more of the nine exemptions. It is DoD policy that DoD
Components shall make discretionary releases whenever possible; however, a discretionary release is
normally not appropriate for records clearly exempt under exemptions 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 (C) and 7(F) (see
Chapter 3, below). Exemptions 2, 5, and 7(A)(B)(D) and (E) (see Chapter 3, below) are discretionary in
nature, and DoD Components are encouraged to exercise discretionary releases whenever possible.
Exemptions 4, 6 and 7(C) cannot be claimed when the requester is the submitter of the information.

        C1.5.5. (AF) A listing of some AFIs that provide guidance on special disclosure procedures for
certain types of records is provided in Appendix 8. Refer to those instructions for specific disclosure
procedures. Remember, the only reason to deny a request is a FOIA exemption.

              C1.5.5.1. (Added)(AF) Refer requests from foreign government officials that do not cite
the FOIA to your foreign disclosure office and notify the requester.

               C1.5.5.2. (Added)(AF) If you have a non-US Government record, determine if you need
to consult with the record's originator before releasing it (see paragraphs C1.5.9, C3.2.1.4 Number 4,
C5.1.5.1, C5.1.5.2, and C5.2.8). This includes records created by foreign governments and organizations
such as North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and North American Aerospace Defense
(NORAD). You may need to coordinate release of foreign government records with either the US
Department of State or with the specific foreign embassy, directly through the MAJCOM FOIA office.
Coordinate release or denial of letters of offer and acceptance (LOA) with SAF/IA through 11 CS/SCSR
(FOIA), 1000 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1000.

        C1.5.6. Public Domain. Nonexempt records released under the authority of this Regulation are
considered to be in the public domain. Such records may also be made available in Components' reading
rooms in paper form, as well as electronically, to facilitate public access. Discretionary releases to FOIA
requesters constitute a waiver of the FOIA exemption that may otherwise apply. Disclosure to a properly
constituted advisory committee, to Congress, or to other Federal Agencies does not waive the
exemption. (See subsection C5.1.4., below.) Exempt records disclosed without authorization by the
appropriate DoD official do not lose their exempt status. Also, while authority may exist to disclose
records to individuals in their official capacity, the provisions of this Regulation apply if the same
individual seeks the records in a private or personal capacity.

       C1.5.7. Creating a Record

                C1.5.7.1. A record must exist and be in the possession and control of the Department of
Defense at the time of the search to be considered subject to this Regulation and the FOIA. There is no
obligation to create, compile, or obtain a record to satisfy a FOIA request. A DoD Component, however,
may compile a new record when so doing would result in a more useful response to the requester, or be
less burdensome to the agency than providing existing records, and the requester does not object. Cost of
creating or compiling such a record may not be charged to the requester unless the fee for creating the
record is equal to or less than the fee which would be charged for providing the existing record. Fee
assessments shall be in accordance with Chapter 6.

               C1.5.7.2. About electronic data, the issue of whether records are actually created or
merely extracted from an existing database is not always readily apparent. Consequently, when
                                                    26
responding to FOIA requests for electronic data where creation of a record, programming, or particular
format are questionable, Components should apply a standard of reasonableness. In other words, if the
capability exists to respond to the request, and the effort would be a business as usual approach, then the
request should be processed. However, the request need not be processed where the capability to
respond does not exist without a significant expenditure of resources, thus not being a normal business
as usual approach. As used in this sense, a significant expenditure of resources in both time and
manpower, that would cause a significant interference with the operation of the Components’ automated
information system would not be a business as usual approach.

       C1.5.8. Description of Requested Record

                C1.5.8.1. Identification of the record desired is the responsibility of the requester. The
requester must provide a description of the desired record, that enables the Government to locate the
record with a reasonable amount of effort. In order to assist DoD Components in conducting more
timely searches, requesters should endeavor to provide as much identifying information as possible.
When a DoD Component receives a request that does not reasonably describe the requested record, it
shall notify the requester of the defect in writing. The requester should be asked to provide the type of
information outlined below in paragraph C1.5.8.2, below, of this Regulation. DoD Components are not
obligated to act on the request until the requester responds to the specificity letter. When practicable,
DoD Components shall offer assistance to the requester in identifying the records sought and in
reformulating the request to reduce the burden on the agency in complying with the Act.

                C.1.5.8.1. (AMC) Allow the requester 30 days to respond to requests for
clarification. If a response is not received within that time, notify the requester that you consider
the case closed.

               C1.5.8.2. The following guidelines are provided to deal with generalized requests and are
based on the principle of reasonable effort: (Descriptive information about a record may be divided into
two broad categories.)

                       C1.5.8.2.1. Category I is file-related and includes information such as type of
record (for example, memorandum), title, index citation, subject area, date the record was created, and
originator.

                          C1.5.8.2.2. Category II is event-related and includes the circumstances that
resulted in the record being created or the date and circumstances surrounding the event the record
covers.

               C1.5.8.3. Generally, a record is not reasonably described unless the description contains
sufficient Category I information to permit the conduct of an organized, non random search based on the
DoD Component's filing arrangements and existing retrieval systems, or unless the record contains
sufficient Category II information to permit inference of the Category I elements needed to conduct such
a search.

                C1.5.8.4. The following guidelines deal with requests for personal records: Ordinarily,
when personal identifiers are provided only in connection with a request for records concerning the
requester, only records in a Privacy Act system of records that can be retrieved by personal identifiers
need be searched. However, if a DoD Component has reason to believe that records on the requester
may exist in a record system other than a Privacy Act system, the DoD Component shall search that
system under the provisions of the FOIA. In either case, DoD Components may request a reasonable
                                                    27
description of the records desired before searching for such records under the provisions of the FOIA
and the Privacy Act (reference (d)). If the record is required to be released under the FOIA, reference (d)
does not bar its disclosure. See subsection C1.5.13, below, for the relationship between the FOIA and
the Privacy Act.

                  C1.5.8.5. The previous guidelines notwithstanding, the decision of the DoD Component
concerning reasonableness of description must be based on knowledge of its files. If the description
enables DoD Component personnel to locate the record with reasonable effort, the description is
adequate. The fact that a FOIA request is broad or burdensome in its magnitude does not, in and of
itself, entitle a DoD Component to deny the request on the ground that it does not reasonably describe
the records sought. The key factor is the ability of the DoD Component’s staff to reasonably ascertain
and locate which records are being requested.

                C1.5.8.5. (AF) Air Force elements must make reasonable efforts to find the records
described in FOIA requests. Reasonable efforts means searching all activities and locations most likely
to have the records, and includes staged or retired records, as well as complete and thorough searches of
relevant electronic records, such as databases, word processing, and electronic mail files. C1.5.9.
Referrals

       C1.5.9. Referrals

                 C1.5.9.1. The DoD FOIA referral policy is based upon the concept of the originator of a
record making a release determination on its information. If a DoD Component receives a request for
records originated by another DoD Component, it should contact the DoD Component to determine if it
also received the request, and if not, obtain concurrence from the other DoD Component to refer the
request. In either situation, the requester shall be advised of the action taken, unless exempt information
would be revealed. While referrals to originators of information result in obtaining the best possible
decision on release of the information, the policy does not relieve DoD Components from the
responsibility of making a release decision on a record should the requester object to referral of the
request and the record. Should this situation occur, DoD Components should coordinate with the
originator of the information prior to making a release determination. A request received by a DoD
Component having no records responsive to a request shall be referred routinely to another DoD
Component, if the other DoD Component has reason to believe it has the requested record. Prior to
notifying a requester of a referral to another DoD Component, the DoD Component receiving the initial
request shall consult with the other DoD Component to determine if that DoD Component’s association
with the material is exempt. If the association is exempt, the DoD Component receiving the initial
request will protect the association and any exempt information without revealing the identity of the
protected DoD Component. The protected DoD Component shall be responsible for submitting the
justifications required in any litigation. Any DoD Component receiving a request that has been
misaddressed shall refer the request to the proper address and advise the requester. DoD Components
making referrals of requests or records shall include with the referral, a point of contact by name, a
telephone number, and an e-mail address.

                C1.5.9.2. A DoD Component shall refer for response directly to the requester, a FOIA
request for a record that it holds to another DoD Component or agency outside the DoD, if the record
originated in the other DoD Component or outside agency. Whenever a record or a portion of a record is
referred to another DoD Component or to a Government Agency outside of the DoD for a release
determination and direct response, the requester shall be informed of the referral, unless it has been


                                                    28
determined that notification would reveal exempt information. Referred records shall only be identified
to the extent consistent with security requirements.

                C1.5.9.3. A DoD Component may refer a request for a record that it originated to another
DoD Component or agency when the other DoD Component or agency has a valid interest in the record,
or the record was created for the use of the other DoD Component or agency. In such situations, provide
the record and a release recommendation on the record with the referral action. Ensure you include a
point of contact with the telephone number. An example of such a situation is a request for audit reports
prepared by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. These advisory reports are prepared for the use of
contracting officers and their release to the audited contractor shall be at the discretion of the contracting
officer. A FOIA request shall be referred to the appropriate DoD Component and the requester shall be
notified of the referral, unless exempt information would be revealed. Another example is a record
originated by a DoD Component or agency that involves foreign relations, and could affect a DoD
Component or organization in a host foreign country. Such a request and any responsive records may be
referred to the affected DoD Component or organization for consultation prior to a final release
determination within the Department of Defense. See also subsection C5.1.5., below, of this Regulation.

                C1.5.9.4. Within the Department of Defense, a DoD Component shall ordinarily refer a
FOIA request and a copy of the record it holds, but that was originated by another DoD Component or
that contains substantial information obtained from another DoD Component, to that Component for
direct response, after direct coordination and obtaining concurrence from the Component. The requester
then shall be notified of such referral. DoD Components shall not, in any case, release or deny such
records without prior consultation with the other DoD Component, except as provided in subsection 5-
104, below.

                C1.5.9.4. (AF) Send all referrals through the FOIA office. The receiving FOIA office
must agree to accept the referral before transfer. The FOIA office will provide the name, phone number,
mailing address, and e-mail address of both the FOIA office point of contact and the record OPR point
of contact in their referral letter. Include the requested record. If the requested records are massive, then
provide a description of them. Referrals to, or consultations with, DFOISR are accomplished from the
MAJCOM level. Appendix 7 has an example of a referral memo.

              C1.5.9.5. DoD Components that receive referred requests shall answer them in
accordance with the time limits established by the FOIA, this Regulation, and their multitrack
processing queues, based upon the date of initial receipt of the request at the referring component or
agency.

               C1.5.9.6. Agencies outside the Department of Defense that are subject to the FOIA.

                          C1.5.9.6.1. A DoD Component may refer a FOIA request for any record that
originated in an agency outside the Department of Defense or that is based on information obtained from
an outside agency to the agency for direct response to the requester after coordination with the outside
agency, if that agency is subject to FOIA. Otherwise, the DoD Component must respond to the request.

                        C1.5.9.6.2. A DoD Component shall refer to the agency that provided the
record any FOIA request for investigative, intelligence, or any other type of records that are on loan to
the Department of Defense for a specific purpose, if the records are restricted from further release and so
marked. However, if for investigative or intelligence purposes, the outside agency desires anonymity, a
DoD Component may only respond directly to the requester after coordination with the outside agency.

                                                     29
               C1.5.9.7. DoD Components that receive requests for records of the National Security
Council (NSC), the White House, or the White House Military Office (WHMO) shall process the
requests. DoD records in which the NSC or White House has a concurrent reviewing interest, and NSC,
White House, or WHMO records discovered in DoD Components’ files shall be forwarded to the
Directorate for Freedom of Information and Security Review (DFOISR). The DFOISR shall coordinate
with the NSC, White House, or WHMO and return the records to the originating agency after
coordination.

               C1.5.9.8. To the extent referrals are consistent with the policies expressed by this
subsection, referrals between offices of the same DoD Component are authorized.

               C1.5.9.9. On occasion, the Department of Defense receives FOIA requests for General
Accounting Office (GAO) records containing DoD information. Even though the GAO is outside the
Executive Branch, and not subject to the FOIA, all FOIA requests for GAO documents containing DoD
information received either from the public, or on referral from the GAO, shall be processed under the
provisions of the FOIA.

               C1.5.9.9. (AF) In some cases, requested records are available from the GPO and NTIS,
5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield VA 22161. These organizations offer certain records for sale to the
public. Current standard releasable Air Force publications are available electronically on the WWW. For
requesters without electronic access, NTIS has paper copies for sale. Give requesters the web address or
NTIS address when appropriate. However, if the requester prefers to pursue the FOIA process, consult
with AF-CIO/P through the MAJCOM. Refer FOIA requests for Air Force publications that are
classified, FOUO, rescinded, or superseded to the OPR through the appropriate FOIA office.

        C1.5.10. Authentication. Records provided under this Regulation shall be authenticated with an
appropriate seal, whenever necessary, to fulfill an official Government or other legal function. This
service, however, is in addition to that required under the FOIA and is not included in the FOIA fee
schedule. DoD Components may charge for the service at a rate of $5.20 for each authentication.

       C1.5.11. Combatant Commands

                C1.5.11.1. The Combatant Commands are placed under the jurisdiction of the OSD,
instead of the administering Military Department or the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, only for
the purpose of administering the DoD FOIA Program. This policy represents an exception to the policies
directed in DoD Directive 5100.3 (reference (e)); it authorizes and requires the Combatant Commands to
process FOIA requests in accordance with DoD Directive 5400.7 (reference (b)) and this Regulation.
The Combatant Commands shall forward directly to the Director, Freedom of Information and Security
Review all correspondence associated with the appeal of an initial denial for records under the
provisions of the FOIA. Procedures to effect this administrative requirement are outlined in Appendix
AP1.

              C1.5.11.2. Combatant Commands shall maintain an electronic reading room for FOIA-
processed 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(D) (reference (a)) records in accordance with Chapter 2, this Regulation.
Records qualifying for this means of public access also shall be maintained in hard copy for public
access at Combatant Commands’ respective locations.

       C1.5.12. Records Management. FOIA records shall be maintained and disposed of in accordance
with the National Archives and Records Administration General Records Schedule, and DoD
Component records schedules.
                                                30
        C1.5.12. (AF) Keep records that were fully released for 2 years and denied records for 6 years.
Include in the 6-year record file copies of records or parts of records that were released in response to
the same request. Refer to Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule
(converting to AFMAN 33-322, Volume 4). The functional OPR or FOIA office may keep the records
released or denied. The FOIA office keeps the FOIA case file for each request. The FOIA case file
consists of: the initial request; tasking to OPRs; OPR's reply; memoranda for record (MFR) of phone
calls or other actions related to the FOIA request; DD Forms 2086, Record of Freedom of Information
(FOI) Processing Cost, or 2086-1, Record of Freedom of Information (FOI) Processing Cost for
Technical Data; final response; and any of the following, if applicable: extension letter; legal opinions;
submitter notification letters and replies; the appeal and required attachments (except for the released or
denied records if maintained by the OPR); and all other correspondence to and from the requester

       C1.5.13. Relationship Between the FOIA and the Privacy Act (PA). Not all requesters are
knowledgeable of the appropriate statutory authority to cite when requesting records, nor are all of them
aware of appeal procedures. In some instances, they may cite neither Act, but will imply one or both
Acts. For these reasons, the below guidelines are provided to ensure that requesters receive the greatest
amount of access rights under both Acts. See also paragraph C5.3., below, regarding appeal rights.

                 C1.5.13.1. If the record is required to be released under the FOIA, the Privacy Act does
not bar its disclosure. Unlike the FOIA, the Privacy Act applies only to U.S. citizens and aliens admitted
for permanent residence.

               C1.5.13.2. Requesters who seek records about themselves contained in a Privacy Act
system of records and who cite or imply only the Privacy Act, will have their requests processed under
the provisions of both the Privacy Act and the FOIA. If the Privacy Act system of records is exempt
from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1) (reference (d)) and if the records, or any portion thereof, are
exempt under the FOIA, the requester shall be so advised with the appropriate Privacy Act and FOIA
exemption. Appeals shall be processed under both Acts.

               C1.5.13.3. Requesters who seek records about themselves that are not contained in a
Privacy Act system of records and who cite or imply the Privacy Act will have their requests processed
under the provisions of the FOIA, since the Privacy Act does not apply to these records. Appeals shall
be processed under the FOIA.

                C1.5.13.4. Requesters who seek records about themselves that are contained in a Privacy
Act system of records and who cite or imply the FOIA or both Acts will have their requests processed
under the provisions of both the Privacy Act and the FOIA. If the Privacy Act system of records is
exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1) (reference (d)) and if the records, or any portion
thereof, are exempt under the FOIA, the requester shall be so advised with the appropriate Privacy Act
and FOIA exemption. Appeals shall be processed under both Acts.

               C1.5.13.5. Requesters who seek access to agency records that are not part of a Privacy
Act system of records, and who cite or imply the Privacy Act and FOIA, will have their requests
processed under the FOIA since the Privacy Act does not apply to these records. Appeals shall be
processed under the FOIA.

                C1.5.13.6. Requesters who seek access to agency records and who cite or imply the FOIA
will have their requests and appeals processed under the FOIA.


                                                    31
               C1.5.13.7. Requesters shall be advised in the final response letter which Act(s) was
(were) used, inclusive of appeal rights as outlined above.

       C1.5.14. Non-Responsive Information in Responsive Records. DoD Components shall interpret
FOIA requests liberally when determining which records are responsive to the requests, and may release
non-responsive information. However, should DoD Components desire to withhold non-responsive
information, the following steps shall be accomplished:

               C1.5.14.1. Consult with the requester, and ask if the requester views the information as
responsive, and if not, seek the requester's concurrence to deletion of nonresponsive information without
a FOIA exemption. Reflect this concurrence in the response letter.

                C1.5.14.2. If the responsive record is unclassified, and the requester does not agree to
deletion of non-responsive information without a FOIA exemption, release all nonresponsive and
responsive information which is not exempt. For non-responsive information that is exempt, notify the
requester that even if the information were determined responsive, it would likely be exempt under (state
appropriate exemption (s)). Advise the requester of the right to request this information under a separate
FOIA request. The separate request shall be placed in the same location within the processing queue as
the original request.

                C1.5.14.3. If the responsive record is classified, and the requester does not agree to
deletion of non-responsive information without a FOIA exemption, release all unclassified responsive
and non-responsive information which is not exempt. If the non-responsive information is exempt,
follow the procedures in subparagraph C1.5.14.2, above. The classified, non-responsive information
need not be reviewed for declassification at this point. Advise the requester that even if the classified
information were determined responsive, it would likely be exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(1) (reference
(a)), and other exemptions if appropriate. Advise the requester of the right to request this information
under a separate FOIA request. The separate request shall be placed in the same location within the
processing queue as the original request.

        C1.5.15. Honoring Form or Format Requests. DoD Components shall provide the record in any
form or format requested by the requester if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.
DoD Components shall make reasonable efforts to maintain their records in forms or formats that are
reproducible. In responding to requests for records, DoD Components shall make reasonable efforts to
search for records in electronic form or format, except when such efforts would significantly interfere
with the operation of the DoD Components’ automated information system. Such determinations shall
be made on a case by case basis. See also paragraph C1.5.7.2, above.




                                                   32
                                               C2. Chapter 2

                                        FOIA READING ROOMS

C2.1. REQUIREMENTS

       C2.1.1. Reading Room

               C2.1.1.1. Each DoD Component shall provide an appropriate facility or facilities where
the public may inspect and copy or have copied the records described in subsections C2.1.2 and C2.2.1,
below. In addition to the records described in subsections C2.1.2 and C2.2.1, below, DoD Components
may elect to place other records in their reading room, and also make them electronically available to the
public. DoD Components may share reading room facilities if the public is not unduly inconvenienced,
and also may establish decentralized reading rooms. When appropriate, the cost of copying may be
imposed on the person requesting the material in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 6 of this
Regulation.

                 C2.1.1.1. (AF) Each FOIA office will arrange for a reading room where the public may
inspect releasable records. You do not need to collocate the reading room with the FOIA office. The
FOIA does not require creation of a reading room dedicated exclusively to this purpose. A “reading
room” is any location where a requester may review records. For (a)(3) records, if requesters meet the
criteria for search and review costs, they must be paid before inspecting records. Assess reproduction
costs at the time of inspection, if appropriate.

             C2.1.1.1. (AMC) Each FOIA office will immediately notify HQ AMC/A6OBR
(FOIA) via e-mail of any URL address changes to its FOIA web site.

        C2.1.2. Record Availability. The FOIA requires that records described in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(A),
(B), (C), and (D) (reference (a)) created on or after November 1, 1996, shall be made available
electronically by November 1, 1997, as well as in hard copy in the FOIA reading room for inspection
and copying, unless such records are published and copies are offered for sale. Personal privacy
information, that if disclosed to a third party requester, would result in an invasion of the first party’s
personal privacy, and contractor submitted information, that if disclosed to a competing contractor,
would result in competitive harm to the submitting contractor shall be deleted from all 5 U.S.C.
552(a)(2) (reference (a)) records made available to the general public. In every case, justification for the
deletion must be fully explained in writing, and the extent of such deletion shall be indicated on the
record which is made publicly available, unless such indication would harm an interest protected by an
exemption under which the deletion was made. If technically feasible, the extent of the deletion in
electronic records or any other form of record shall be indicated at the place in the record where the
deletion was made. However, a DoD Component may publish in the Federal Register a description of
the basis upon which it will delete identifying details of particular types of records to avoid clearly
unwarranted invasions of privacy, or competitive harm to business submitters. In appropriate cases, the
DoD Component may refer to this description rather than write a separate justification for each deletion.
5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(A), (B), (C), and (D) records are:

                C2.1.2.1. (a)(2)(A) records. Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions,
and orders made in the adjudication of cases, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551 (reference (f)), that may be
cited, used, or relied upon as precedents in future adjudications.


                                                     33
              C2.1.2.2. (a)(2)(B) records. Statements of policy and interpretations that have been
adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register.

                C2.1.2.3. (a)(2)(C) records. Administrative staff manuals and instructions, or portions
thereof, that establish DoD policy or interpretations of policy that affect a member of the public. This
provision does not apply to instructions for employees on tactics and techniques to be used in
performing their duties, or to instructions relating only to the internal management of the DoD
Component. Examples of manuals and instructions not normally made available are:

                         C2.1.2.3.1. Those issued for audit, investigation, and inspection purposes, or
those that prescribe operational tactics, standards of performance, or criteria for defense, prosecution, or
settlement of cases.

                        C2.1.2.3.2. Operations and maintenance manuals and technical information
concerning munitions, equipment, systems, and intelligence activities.

                C2.1.2.4. (a)(2)(D) records. Those 5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(3) (reference (a)) records, which
because of the nature of the subject matter, have become or are likely to become the subject of
subsequent requests for substantially the same records. These records are referred to as FOIAprocessed
(a)(2) records.

                           C2.1.2.4.1. DoD Components shall decide on a case by case basis whether
records fall into this category, based on the following factors:

                                     C2.1.2.4.1.1. Previous experience of the DoD Component with
similar records.

                                     C2.1.2.4.1.2. Particular circumstances of the records involved,
including their nature and the type of information contained in them.

                                      C2.1.2.4.1.3. The identity and number of requesters and whether
there is widespread press, historic, or commercial interest in the records.

                          C2.1.2.4.2. This provision is intended for situations where public access in a
timely manner is important, and it is not intended to apply where there may be a limited number of
requests over a short period of time from a few requesters. DoD Components may remove the records
from this access medium when the appropriate officials determine that access is no longer necessary.

                         C2.1.2.4.2. (AF) AF-CIO/P will make the traditional (a)(2) materials (Title 5
U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(A), (B), and (C)) available to the public. Each Air Force activity must make Title 5
U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(D) records (“FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) records”—records which they determine will,
or have become, the subject of frequent or subsequent requests) available to the public in a reading room
in hard copy and electronically by posting it to their appropriate web site. There is no requirement to
make all FOIA-released records available electronically. The FOIA manager, in coordination with the
functional OPR, or the owner of the records, will determine qualifying records, after coordination with
any interested OCRs. As required by AFIs 33-129 and 35-101, OPRs request clearance of these records
with the PAO before posting on the WWW.

                                       C2.1.2.4.2.1. (Added)(AF) Normally, if the FOIA office or OPR
receives, or anticipates receiving, three or more requests for the same record in a quarter, they will
                                                     34
consider it a frequently requested record (FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) record) and make it publicly
available in hard copy and electronically as outlined in paragraph C2.1.2. OPRs may elect to make other
records publicly available if they receive, or expect to receive, less than three requests a quarter. The
purpose is to make records available in an ERR to potential future FOIA requesters instead of waiting to
receive a FOIA request, and reduce the number of multiple FOIA requests for the same records
requiring separate responses. In making these determinations, recognize there are some situations in
which a certain type of record becomes the subject of simultaneous FOIA requests from all interested
parties and then ceases to be of interest. Activities may typically receive a “flurry” of FOIA requests for
contract records immediately after a contract is awarded, but do not receive any subsequent requests for
such bulky records after that point. In some cases activities may decide that placing records in the ERR
would not serve the statutory purpose of “diverting some potential FOIA requests for previously
released records.”

                                      C2.1.2.4.2.2 . (Added)(AF) GILS. Each activity that posts FOIA-
processed (a)(2)(D) records (records which they determine will, or have become, the subject of frequent
or subsequent requests) must create a GILS record for each FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) record and post it
to DefenseLINK. The OPR prepares the GILS record. You can complete and submit a GILS record on-
line using a web browser. Instructions for completing the GILS record, and an on-line form are at
http://sites.defenselink.mil. Follow the steps listed on the web page. The GILS site on DefenseLINK will
serve as the central index of Air Force FOIA (a)(2)(D) records.

                                       C2.1.2.4.2.3. (Added)(AF) In addition, installations will post a list,
or index, of locally produced FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) records on their web page at their FOIA site.
Each listing will point or link to the particular record. In addition, MAJCOMs may choose to post their
own index of MAJCOM specific FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) records to their appropriate web site.
Installation web pages will include the following phrase (or similar words) on their FOIA site if they do
not have any frequently requested FOIA records: “There are no frequently requested FOIA records to
post at this time.” Include the following statement, or a similar one, on the installation web page with the
records: “Some records are released to the public under the FOIA, and may therefore reflect deletion of
some information in accordance with the FOIA’s nine statutory exemptions. A consolidated list of such
records is on DefenseLINK.” Link the word “DefenseLINK” to
http://sites.defenselink.mil/index.html#register and click on “Browse,” and “FOIA Electronic Reading
Room Documents.” Qualifying releasable records with exempt information redacted must show on the
record the amount of information withheld and the exemption reason (for example, (b)(6)). Activities
with such records should provide the public an index and explanation of the FOIA exemptions. All
installation FOIA pages will include the capability for FOIA requesters to send an electronic FOIA
request, contain a link to their Reading Room, and include a link to the Air Force FOIA page,
http://www.foia.af.mil.

                                     C2.1.2.4.2.4. (Added)(AF) FOIA web pages should be clearly
accessed from the main installation page, either by a direct link to “FOIA” or “Freedom of Information
Act” from the main page, or found under a logical heading such as “Library” or “Sites.”

                           C2.1.2.4.3. Should a requester submit a FOIA request for FOIA processed
(a)(2) records, and insist that the request be processed, DoD Components shall process the FOIA
request. However, DoD Components have no obligation to process a FOIA request for 5 U.S.C.
552(a)(2)(A), (B), and (C) (reference (a)) records because these records are required to be made public
and not FOIA-processed under paragraph (a)(3) of the FOIA.

C2.2. INDEXES

         C2.2.1. "(a)(2)" Materials

                C2.2.1.1. Each DoD Component shall maintain in each facility prescribed in paragraph
C2.1.1 above, an index of materials described in paragraph C2.1.2., above, that are issued, adopted, or
promulgated, after July 4, 1967. No "(a) (2)" materials issued, promulgated, or adopted after July 4,
1967, that are not indexed and either made available or published may be relied upon, used or cited as
precedent against any individual unless such individual has actual and-timely notice of the contents of
such materials. Such materials issued, promulgated, or adopted before July 4, 1967, need not be indexed,
but must be made available upon request if not exempted under this Regulation.

                C2.2.1.1. (AF) The GILS records on DefenseLINK will serve as the index.

                C2.2.1.2. Each DoD Component shall promptly publish quarterly or more frequently, and
distribute, by sale or otherwise, copies of each index of "(a) (2)" materials or supplements thereto unless
it publishes in the Federal Register an order containing a determination that publication is unnecessary
and impracticable. A copy of each index or supplement not published shall be provided to a requester at
a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication as set forth in Chapter 6 of this Regulation.

               C2.2.1.3. Each index of "(a) (2)" materials or supplement thereto shall be arranged topical
or by descriptive words rather than by case name or numbering system so that members of the public
can readily locate material. Case name and numbering arrangements, however, may also be included for
DoD Component convenience.

               C2.2.1.4. A general index of FOIA-processed (a)(2) records referred to in paragraph
C2.1.2.4., above, shall be made available to the public, both in hard copy and electronically by
December 31, 1999.

         C2.2.2. Other Materials

               C2.2.2.1. Any available index of DoD Component material published in the Federal
Register, such as material required to be published by Section 552(a)(1) of the FOIA, shall be made
available in DoD Component FOIA reading rooms, and electronically to the public.

                C2.2.2.2. Although not required to be made available in response to FOIA requests or
made available in FOIA Reading Rooms, "(a)(1)" materials shall, when feasible, be made available to
the public in FOIA reading rooms for inspection and copying, and by electronic means. Examples of
"(a)(1)" materials are: descriptions of an agency's central and field organization, and to the extent they
affect the public, rules of procedures, descriptions of forms available, instruction as to the scope and
contents of papers, reports, or examinations, and any amendment, revision, or report of the
aforementioned.

                C2.2.2.2. (AF) AF-CIO/P makes the appropriate (a)(1) materials available for the Air
Force.

                                              C3. Chapter 3

                                             EXEMPTIONS

C3.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

       C3.1.1. General. Records that meet the exemption criteria of the FOIA may be withheld from
public disclosure and need not be published in the Federal Register, made available in a library reading
room, or provided in response to a FOIA request.

C3.2. EXEMPTIONS

        C3.2.1. FOIA Exemptions. The following types of records may be withheld in whole or in part
from public disclosure under the FOIA, unless otherwise prescribed by law: A discretionary release of a
record (see also subsection C1.5.5., above) to one requester shall prevent the withholding of the same
record under a FOIA exemption if the record is subsequently requested by someone else. However, a
FOIA exemption may be invoked to withhold information that is similar or related that has been the
subject of a discretionary release. In applying exemptions, the identity of the requester and the purpose
for which the record is sought are irrelevant with the exception that an exemption may not be invoked
where the particular interest to be protected is the requester's interest. However, if the subject of the
record is the requester for the record and the record is contained in a Privacy Act system of records, it
may only be denied to the requester if withholding is both authorized by DoD 5400.11-R (reference (v))
and by a FOIA exemption.

                 C3.2.1.1. Number 1. (5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(1) (reference (a)). Those properly and currently
classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, as specifically authorized under the
criteria established by Executive Order and implemented by regulations, such as DoD 5200.1-R
(reference (g)). Although material is not classified at the time of the FOIA request, a classification
review may be undertaken to determine whether the information should be classified. The procedures in
reference (g) apply. If the information qualifies as exemption 1 information, there is no discretion
regarding its release. In addition, this exemption shall be invoked when the following situations are
apparent:

                           C3.2.1.1.1. The fact of the existence or nonexistence of a record would itself
reveal classified information. In this situation, Components shall neither confirm nor deny the existence
or nonexistence of the record being requested. A "refusal to confirm or deny" response must be used
consistently, not only when a record exists, but also when a record does not exist. Otherwise, the pattern
of using a "no record" response when a record does not exist, and a "refusal to confirm or deny" when a
record does exist will itself disclose national security information.

                         C3.2.1.1.2. Compilations of items of information that are individually
unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals additional association or relationship
that meets the standard for classification under an existing executive order for classification and DoD
5200.1-R (reference (g)), and is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information.

                           C3.2.1.1.2. (AF) When a requester seeks records that are classified, or should
be classified, only an initial classification authority, or a declassification authority, can make final
determinations with respect to classification issues. The fact that a record is marked with a security
classification is not enough to support withholding the document; make sure it is “properly and currently
classified.” Review the record paragraph by paragraph for releasable information. Review declassified
                                                       37
and unclassified parts before release to see if they are exempt by other exemptions. Before releasing a
reviewed and declassified document, draw a single black line through all the classification markings so
they are still legible and stamp the document unclassified. If the requested records are “properly and
currently classified,” and the Air Force withholds from release under FOIA exemption (b)(1), and the
requester appeals the withholding, include a written statement from an initial classification authority or
declassification authority certifying the data was properly classified originally and that it remains
properly classified per Executive Order. Examples of initial classification and declassification authority
statements are included in Appendix 7. Guidance on document declassification reviews is in AFI 31-
401, Managing the Information Security Program, and DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program,
January 1997.

                C3.2.1.2. Number 2. (5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(2) (reference (a)). Those related solely to the
internal personnel rules and practices of the Department of Defense or any of its Components. This
exemption is entirely discretionary. This exemption has two profiles, high (b)(2) and low (b)(2).
Paragraph C3.2.1.2.2., below, contains a brief discussion on the low (b)(2) profile; however, that
discussion is for information purposes only. When only a minimum Government interest would be
affected (administrative burden), there is a great potential for discretionary disclosure of the information.
Consequently, DoD Components shall not invoke the low (b)(2) profile.

                           C3.2.1.2.1. Records qualifying under high (b)(2) are those containing or
constituting statutes, rules, regulations, orders, manuals, directives, instructions, and security
classification guides, the release of which would allow circumvention of these records thereby
substantially hindering the effective performance of a significant function of the Department of Defense.
Examples include:

                                     C3.2.1.2.1.1. Those operating rules, guidelines, and manuals for
DoD investigators, inspectors, auditors, or examiners that must remain privileged in order for the DoD
Component to fulfill a legal requirement.

                                   C3.2.1.2.1.2. Personnel and other administrative matters, such as
examination questions and answers used in training courses or in the determination of the qualifications
of candidates for employment, entrance on duty, advancement, or promotion.

                                     C3.2.1.2.1.3. Computer software, the release of which would allow
circumvention of a statute or DoD rules, regulations, orders, manuals, directives, or instructions. In this
situation, the use of the software must be closely examined to ensure a circumvention possibility exists.

                           C3.2.1.2.2. Records qualifying under the low (b)(2) profile are those that are
trivial and housekeeping in nature for which there is no legitimate public interest or benefit to be gained
by release, and it would constitute an administrative burden to process the request in order to disclose
the records. Examples include rules of personnel's use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours,
statements of policy as to sick leave, and administrative data such as file numbers, mail routing stamps,
initials, data processing notations, brief references to previous communications, and other like
administrative markings. DoD Components shall not invoke the low (b)(2) profile.

                C3.2.1.3. Number 3. (5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(3) (reference (a)). Those concerning matters that a
statute specifically exempts from disclosure by terms that permit no discretion on the issue, or in
accordance with criteria established by that statute for withholding or referring to particular types of
matters to be withheld. The Directorate for Freedom of Information and Security Review maintains a list

                                                     38
of (b)(3) statutes used within the Department of Defense, and provides updated lists of these statutes to
DoD Components on a periodic basis. A few examples of such statutes are:

              C3.2.1.3. (AF) AF-CIO/P will provide the current DoD (b)(3) statutes list to the
MAJCOMs. You may access the current list of DoD (b)(3) statutes by going to http://www.foia.af.mil,

                         C3.2.1.3.1. Patent Secrecy, 35 U.S.C. 181-188 (reference (h)). Any records
containing information relating to inventions that are the subject of patent applications on which Patent
Secrecy Orders have been issued.

                           C3.2.1.3.9. Procurement Integrity, 41 U.S.C. 423 (reference (q)).

                C3.2.1.4. Number 4. (5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(4) (reference (a)). Those containing trade secrets
or commercial or financial information that a DoD Component receives from a person or organization
outside the Government with the understanding that the information or record will be retained on a
privileged or confidential basis in accordance with the customary handling of such records. Records
within the exemption must contain trade secrets, or commercial or financial records, the disclosure of
which is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the source providing the
information; impair the Government's ability to obtain necessary information in the future; or impair
some other legitimate Government interest. Commercial or financial information submitted on a
voluntary basis, absent any exercised authority prescribing criteria for submission is protected without
any requirement to show competitive harm (see paragraph C3.2.1.4.8., below). If the information
qualifies as exemption 4 information, there is no discretion in its release. Examples include:

                          C3.2.1.4.1. Commercial or financial information received in confidence in
connection with loans, bids, contracts, or proposals set forth in or incorporated by reference in a contract
entered into between the DoD Component and the offeror that submitted the proposal, as well as other
information received in confidence or privileged, such as trade secrets, inventions, discoveries, or other
proprietary data. See also C5.2.8.2., below, this Regulation. Additionally, when the provisions of 10
                                                     39
U.S.C. 2305(g) (reference (p)), and 41 U.S.C. 423 (reference (q)) are met, certain proprietary and source
selection information may be withheld under exemption 3.

                         C3.2.1.4.2. Statistical data and commercial or financial information concerning
contract performance, income, profits, losses, and expenditures, if offered and received in confidence
from a contractor or potential contractor.

                           C3.2.1.4.3. Personal statements given in the course of inspections,
investigations, or audits, when such statements are received in confidence from the individual and
retained in confidence because they reveal trade secrets or commercial or financial information normally
considered confidential or privileged.

                         C3.2.1.4.4. Financial data provided in confidence by private employers in
connection with locality wage surveys that are used to fix and adjust pay schedules applicable to the
prevailing wage rate of employees within the Department of Defense.

                           C3.2.1.4.5. Scientific and manufacturing processes or developments concerning
technical or scientific data or other information submitted with an application for a research grant, or
with a report while research is in progress.

                          C3.2.1.4.6. Technical or scientific data developed by a contractor or
subcontractor exclusively at private expense, and technical or scientific data developed in part with
Federal funds and in part at private expense, wherein the contractor or subcontractor has retained
legitimate proprietary interests in such data in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2320-2321 (reference (r)) and
DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Chapter 2 of 48 C.F.R., Subpart 227.71-
227.72 (reference (s)). Technical data developed exclusively with Federal funds may be withheld under
Exemption Number 3 if it meets the criteria of 10 U.S.C. 130 (reference (k)) and DoD Directive 5230.25
(reference (l)) (see subsection C3.2.1., Number 3 C3.2.1.3.5., above).

                         C3.2.1.4.7. Computer software which is copyrighted under the Copyright Act
of 1976 (17 U.S.C. 106) (reference (t)), the disclosure of which would have an adverse impact on the
potential market value of a copyrighted work.

                           C3.2.1.4.8. Proprietary information submitted strictly on a voluntary basis,
absent any exercised authority prescribing criteria for submission. Examples of exercised authorities
prescribing criteria for submission are statutes, Executive Orders, regulations, invitations for bids,
requests for proposals, and contracts. Submission of information under these authorities is not voluntary.
(See also subsection C5.2.8.3., below.)

                          C3.2.1.4.8. (AF) The Air Force, in compliance with Executive Order 12600,
will advise submitters of contractor-submitted records when a FOIA requester seeks the release of such
records, regardless of any initial determination of whether FOIA exemption (b)(4) applies. (See
paragraph C5.2.8.1, and Appendix 11.) Due to a change to Title 48 CFR, Federal Acquisition
Regulations System, submitter notification is not required prior to release of unit prices contained in
contracts awarded based upon solicitations issued after 1 January 1998. For solicitations issued before 1
January 1998, conduct a normal submitter notice. Unit prices contained in proposals provided prior to
contract award are protected from release, as are all portions of unsuccessful proposals (before and after
contract award) (10 USC 2305(g), Prohibition on Release of Contractor Proposals).


                                                    40
                C3.2.1.5. Number 5. (5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(5) (reference (a)). Those containing information
considered privileged in litigation, primarily under the deliberative process privilege. Except as provided
in paragraphs Number 5 C3.2.1.5.2. through C3.2.1.5.5., below, internal advice, recommendations, and
subjective evaluations, as contrasted with factual matters, that are reflected in deliberative records
pertaining to the decision-making process of an agency, whether within or among agencies (as defined
in 5 U.S.C. 552(e) (reference (a)), or within or among DoD Components. In order to meet the test of this
exemption, the record must be both deliberative in nature, as well as part of a decision-making process.
Merely being an internal record is insufficient basis for withholding under this exemption. Also
potentially exempted are records pertaining to the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work-
product privilege. This exemption is entirely discretionary.

                C3.2.1.5. (AF) Attorney-client records could include, e.g., when a commander expresses
concerns in confidence to his or her judge advocate and asks for a legal opinion. The legal opinion and
everything the commander tells the judge advocate in confidence qualify under this privilege. Unlike
deliberative process privilege, both facts and opinions qualify under the attorney work product or
attorney-client privilege. Attorney work product records are records an attorney prepares, or supervises
the preparation of, in contemplating or preparing for administrative proceedings or litigation.

                          C3.2.1.5.1. Examples of the deliberative process include:

                                       C3.2.1.5.1.1. The non factual portions of staff papers, to include
after-action reports, lessons learned, and situation reports containing staff evaluations, advice, opinions,
or suggestions.

                                    C3.2.1.5.1.2. Advice, suggestions, or evaluations prepared on behalf
of the Department of Defense by individual consultants or by boards, committees, councils, groups,
panels, conferences, commissions, task forces, or other similar groups that are formed for the purpose of
obtaining advice and recommendations.

                                  C3.2.1.5.1.3. Those non factual portions of evaluations by DoD
Component personnel of contractors and their products.

                                        C3.2.1.5.1.4. Information of a speculative, tentative, or evaluative
nature or such matters as proposed plans to procure, lease or otherwise acquire and dispose of materials,
real estate, facilities or functions, when such information would provide undue or unfair competitive
advantage to private personal interests or would impede legitimate government functions.

                                     C3.2.1.5.1.5. Trade secret or other confidential research
development, or commercial information owned by the Government, where premature release is likely
to affect the Government's negotiating position or other commercial interest.

                                      C3.2.1.5.1.6. Those portions of official reports of inspection, reports
of the Inspector Generals, audits, investigations, or surveys pertaining to safety, security, or the internal
management, administration, or operation of one or more DoD Components, when these records have
traditionally been treated by the courts as privileged against disclosure in litigation.

                                       C3.2.1.5.1.6. (AF) Based on court decisions in FOIA litigation,
which led to the release of results of personnel surveys, FOIA managers and IDAs should get advice
from an Air Force attorney before withholding survey results under FOIA exemption (b)(5).

                                                     41
                                      C3.2.1.5.1.7. Planning, programming, and budgetary information
that is involved in the defense planning and resource allocation process.

                           C3.2.1.5.2. If any such intra- or inter-agency record or reasonably segregable
portion of such record hypothetically would be made available routinely through the discovery process
in the course of litigation with the Agency, then it should not be withheld underthe FOIA. If, however,
the information hypothetically would not be released at all, or would only be released in a particular case
during civil discovery where a party’s particularized showing of need might override a privilege, then
the record may be withheld. Discovery is the formal process by which litigants obtain information from
each other for use in the litigation. Consult with legal counsel to determine whether exemption 5
material would be routinely made available through the discovery process.

                         C3.2.1.5.3. Intra- or inter-agency memoranda or letters that are factual, or those
reasonably segregable portions that are factual, are routinely made available through discovery, and
shall be made available to a requester, unless the factual material is otherwise exempt from release,
inextricably intertwined with the exempt information, so fragmented as to be uninformative, or so
redundant of information already available to the requester as to provide no new substantive
information.

                          C3.2.1.5.4. A direction or order from a superior to a subordinate, though
contained in an internal communication, generally cannot be withheld from a requester if it constitutes
policy guidance or a decision, as distinguished from a discussion of preliminary matters or a request for
information or advice that would compromise the decision-making process.

                         C3.2.1.5.5. An internal communication concerning a decision that subsequently
has been made a matter of public record must be made available to a requester when the rationale for the
decision is expressly adopted or incorporated by reference in the record containing the decision.

                C3.2.1.6. Number 6. (5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(6) (reference (a)). Information in personnel and
medical files, as well as similar personal information in other files, that, if disclosed to a requester, other
than the person about whom the information is about, would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy. Release of information about an individual contained in a Privacy Act System of
records that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy is prohibited, and could subject
the releaser to civil and criminal penalties. If the information qualifies as exemption 6 information, there
is no discretion in its release.

                C3.2.1.6. (AF) AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program, provides guidance on
collecting and safeguarding social security numbers (SSN). Paragraph 3.3.3. states: “SSNs are personal
and unique to each individual. Protect them as FOUO. Do not disclose them to anyone without an
official need to know.” Before releasing an Air Force record to a FOIA requester, delete SSNs that
belong to anyone other than the requester. In any subsequent FOIA release to a different requester of
those same records, make sure SSNs are deleted. When feasible, notify Air Force employees when
someone submits a FOIA request for information about them. The notification letter should include a
brief description of the records requested. Also include a statement that only releasable records will be
provided and we will protect personal information as required by the FOIA and Privacy laws. Personal
information may not be posted at publicly accessible DoD web sites unless to do so is clearly authorized
by law and implementing regulation and policy. Personal information should not be posted at
nonpublicly accessible web sites unless it is mission essential and appropriate safeguards have been
established. See also AFIs 33-129 and 35-101.

                                                      42
                         C3.2.1.6.1. Examples of other files containing personal information similar to
that contained in personnel and medical files include:

                                        C3.2.1.6.1.1. Those compiled to evaluate or adjudicate the
suitability of candidates for civilian employment or membership in the Armed Forces, and the eligibility
of individuals (civilian, military, or contractor employees) for security clearances, or for access to
particularly sensitive classified information.

                                    C3.2.1.6.1.2. Files containing reports, records, and other material
pertaining to personnel matters in which administrative action, including disciplinary action, may be
taken.

                          C3.2.1.6.2. Home addresses, including private e-mail addresses, are normally
not releasable without the consent of the individuals concerned. This includes lists of home addressees
and military quarters’ addressees without the occupant’s name. Additionally, the names and duty
addresses (postal and/or e-mail) of DoD military and civilian personnel who are assigned to units that
are sensitive, routinely deployable, or stationed in foreign territories can constitute a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy.

                                       C3.2.1.6.2.1. Privacy Interest. A privacy interest may exist in
personal information even though the information has been disclosed at some place and time. If personal
information is not freely available from sources other than the Federal Government, a privacy interest
exists in its nondisclosure. The fact that the Federal Government expended funds to prepare, index and
maintain records on personal information, and the fact that a requester invokes FOIA to obtain these
records indicates the information is not freely available.

                                       C3.2.1.6.2.2. Names and duty addresses (postal and/or e-mail)
published in telephone directories, organizational charts, rosters and similar materials for personnel
assigned to units that are sensitive, routinely deployable, or stationed in foreign territories are
withholdable under this exemption.

                                       C3.2.1.6.2.2. (AF) Withhold names and duty addresses of personnel
serving overseas or in sensitive or routinely deployable units. Routinely deployable units normally leave
their permanent home stations on a periodic or rotating basis for peacetime operations or for scheduled
training exercises conducted outside the United States or United States territories. Units based in the
United States for a long time, such as those in extensive training or maintenance activities, do not
qualify during that period. Units designated for deployment on contingency plans not yet executed and
units that seldom leave the United States or United States territories (e.g., annually or semi-annually) are
not routinely deployable units. However, units alerted for deployment outside the United States or
United States territories during actual execution of a contingency plan or in support of a crisis operation
qualify. The way the Air Force deploys units makes it difficult to determine when a unit that has part of
its personnel deployed becomes eligible for denial. The Air Force may consider a unit deployed on a
routine basis or deployed fully overseas when 30 percent of its personnel have been either alerted or
actually deployed. In this context, alerted means that a unit has received an official written warning of
an impending operational mission outside the United States or United States territories. Sensitive units
are those involved in special activities or classified missions, including, for example, intelligence-
gathering units that collect, handle, dispose of, or store classified information and materials, as well as
units that train or advise foreign personnel.


                                                     43
                                    C3.2.1.6.2.2. (AMC) Lists of names will not be released. Listings
of office symbols may be released. When releasing, advise the requester that “Air Force directives
prohibit the delivery of unofficial mass mailings (50 pieces or more from the same mailer on the
same day). Repeated mailings of less than 50 pieces to circumvent policy are prohibited.”

                                                   C3.2.1.6.2.2.1. (Added)(AF) Each MAJCOM and
FOA will establish a system and assign OPRs to identify United States-based units in their command
qualifying for the “sensitive or routinely deployable unit” designation, under this exemption.
Appropriate OPRs could include directors of operations, plans and programs, and personnel.

                                                  C3.2.1.6.2.2.1. (AMC) Each base FOIA manager
will update the list of routinely deployable/sensitive units. Forward the updated list to HQ
AMC/A6OBR by 1 February and 1 August for consolidation. The reports control symbol is RCS:
AMC-A6O(SA)9906 (Designation of Routinely Deployable/Sensitive Units 30% Deployed). Note:
This report is designated emergency status code D - Immediately discontinue reporting data
requirements during emergency conditions. Discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE.

                                                      C3.2.1.6.2.2.2. (Added)(AF) MAJCOM FOIA
managers will ensure the list of sensitive and routinely deployable units is reviewed in January and July,
and will follow that review with a memo to the Air Force Personnel Center (HQ AFPC/MSIMD), 550C
Street West, Suite 48, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4750, either validating the current list or providing a
revised listing based on the current status of deployed units at that time. This listing is in American
Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format on a 3-½” (doublesided, high density)
diskette, that contains the unit's eight-position personnel accounting symbol (PAS) code, with one PAS
code per line (record)(8-byte record). The MAJCOM FOIA manager will send an electronic copy of the
list of nonreleaseable units to HQ AFPC/MSIMD that is included in the personnel data system. The
MAJCOM and HQ AFPC FOIA offices will use it to determine releasable units. This reporting
requirement is exempt from licensing with a reports control symbol (RCS) in accordance with AFI 33-
324, The Information Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and
Interagency Air Force Information Collections.

                          C3.2.1.6.3. This exemption shall not be used in an attempt to protect the
privacy of a deceased person, but it may be used to protect the privacy of the deceased person's family if
disclosure would rekindle grief, anguish, pain, embarrassment, or even disruption of peace of mind of
surviving family members. In such situations, balance the surviving family members’ privacy against
the public’s right to know to determine if disclosure is in the public interest. Additionally, the deceased’s
social security number should be withheld since it is used by the next of kin to receive benefits.
Disclosures may be made to the immediate next of kin as defined in DoD Directive 5154.24 (reference
(u)).

                          C3.2.1.6.4. A clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of third parties
identified in a personnel, medical or similar record constitutes a basis for deleting those reasonably
segregable portions of that record. When withholding third party personal information from the subject
of the record and the record is contained in a Privacy Act system of records, consult with legal counsel.

                         C3.2.1.6.4. (AMC) Insurance companies, requesting records on behalf of
their insured, will be processed under the Privacy Act. Insurance company agents (i.e.,
ChoicePoint and Metropolitan), requesting records for an insurance company, will be processed
under the Privacy Act if accompanied by a written release from the insurance company or

                                                     44
insured. Attorneys requesting records about their client, on behalf of their client, will be processed
under the Privacy Act only if accompanied by a written release from their client. Otherwise,
process under the Freedom of Information Act. Note: When processing records under the Privacy
Act, remove all third-party personal information, other than name, government organization, and
government work phone.

                           C3.2.1.6.5. This exemption also applies when the fact of the existence or
nonexistence of a responsive record would itself reveal personally private information, and the public
interest in disclosure is not sufficient to outweigh the privacy interest. In this situation, DoD
Components shall neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of the record being requested.
This is a Glomar response, and exemption 6 must be cited in the response. Additionally, in order to
insure personal privacy is not violated during referrals, DoD Components shall coordinate with other
DoD Components or Federal Agencies before referring a record that is exempt under the Glomar
concept.

                                       C3.2.1.6.5.1. A "refusal to confirm or deny" response must be used
consistently, not only when a record exists, but also when a record does not exist. Otherwise, the pattern
of using a "no records" response when a record does not exist and a "refusal to confirm or deny" when a
record does exist will itself disclose personally private information.

                                       C3.2.1.6.5.2. Refusal to confirm or deny should not be used when
(a) the person whose personal privacy is in jeopardy has provided the requester a waiver of his or her
privacy rights; (b) the person initiated or directly participated in an investigation that lead to the creation
of an agency record seeks access to that record; or (c) the person whose personal privacy is in jeopardy
is deceased, the Agency is aware of that fact, and disclosure would not invade the privacy of the
deceased’s family. See paragraph Number C3.2.1.6.2.3., above.

                 C3.2.1.7. Number 7. (5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(7) (reference (a)). Records or information
compiled for law enforcement purposes; i.e., civil, criminal, or military law, including the
implementation of Executive Orders or regulations issued pursuant to law. This exemption may be
invoked to prevent disclosure of documents not originally created for, but later gathered for law
enforcement purposes. With the exception of parts (C) and (F) (see subparagraph Number 7
C3.2.1.7.1.3., below) of this exemption, this exemption is discretionary. If information qualifies as
exemption (7)(C) or (7)(F) (see subparagraph Number 7 C3.2.1.7.1.3., below) information, there is no
discretion in its release.

                        C3.2.1.7.1. This exemption applies, however, only to the extent that production
of such law enforcement records or information could result in the following:

                                   C3.2.1.7.1.1. Could reasonably be expected to interfere with
enforcement proceedings (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(A) (reference (a)).

                                     C3.2.1.7.1.2. Would deprive a person of the right to a fair trial or to
an impartial adjudication (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(B) (reference (a)).

                                      C3.2.1.7.1.3. Could reasonably be expected to constitute an
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of a living person, including surviving family members of an
individual identified in such a record (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(C) (reference (a)).


                                                      45
                                    C3.2.1.7.1.3. (AF) Guidance provided in paragraph (AF) C3.2.1.6.
also applies to SSNs in records compiled for law enforcement purposes. Do not disclose SSNs to anyone
without an official need to know.

                                                     C3.2.1.7.1.3.1. This exemption also applies when the
fact of the existence or nonexistence of a responsive record would itself reveal personally private
information, and the public interest in disclosure is not sufficient to outweigh the privacy interest. In this
situation, Components shall neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of the record being
requested. This is a Glomar response, and exemption (7)(C) must be cited in the response. Additionally,
in order to insure personal privacy is not violated during referrals, DoD Components shall coordinate
with other DoD Components or Federal Agencies before referring a record that is exempt under the
Glomar concept.

                                                   C3.2.1.7.1.3.2. A "refusal to confirm or deny"
response must be used consistently, not only when a record exists, but also when a record does not exist.
Otherwise, the pattern of using a "no records" response when a record does not exist and a "refusal to
confirm or deny" when a record does exist will itself disclose personally private information.

                                                    C3.2.1.7.1.3.3. Refusal to confirm or deny should not
be used when 1 the person whose personal privacy is in jeopardy has provided the requester with a
waiver of his or her privacy rights; or 2 the person whose personal privacy is in jeopardy is deceased,
and the Agency is aware of that fact.

                                                     C3.2.1.7.1.3.4. Could reasonably be expected to
disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a source within the Department of Defense; a
State, local, or foreign agency or authority; or any private institution that furnishes the information on a
confidential basis; and could disclose information furnished from a confidential source and obtained by
a criminal law enforcement authority in a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful
national security intelligence investigation (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(D) (reference (a)).

                                                  C3.2.1.7.1.3.5. Would disclose techniques and
procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk
circumvention of the law (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(E) (reference (a)).

                                                    C3.2.1.7.1.3.6. Could reasonably be expected to
endanger the life or physical safety of any individual (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(F) (reference (a).

                          C3.2.1.7.2. Some examples of exemption 7 are:

                                     C3.2.1.7.2.1. Statements of witnesses and other material developed
during the course of the investigation and all materials prepared in connection with related Government
litigation or adjudicative proceedings.

                                      C3.2.1.7.2.2. The identity of firms or individuals being investigated
for alleged irregularities involving contracting with the Department of Defense when no indictment has
been obtained nor any civil action filed against them by the United States.

                                      C3.2.1.7.2.3. Information obtained in confidence, expressed or
implied, in the course of a criminal investigation by a criminal law enforcement agency or office within
                                                     46
a DoD Component, or a lawful national security intelligence investigation conducted by an authorized
agency or office within a DoD Component. National security intelligence investigations include
background security investigations and those investigations conducted for the purpose of obtaining
affirmative or counterintelligence information.

                         C3.2.1.7.3. The right of individual litigants to investigative records currently
available by law (such as, the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500, (reference (w)) is not diminished.

                           C3.2.1.7.4. Exclusions. Excluded from the above exemption are the below two
situations applicable to the Department of Defense. (Components considering invoking an exclusion
should first consult with the Department of Justice, Office of Information and Privacy.)

                                      C3.2.1.7.4.1. Whenever a request is made that involves access to
records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, and the investigation or proceeding
involves a possible violation of criminal law where there is reason to believe that the subject of the
investigation or proceeding is unaware of its pendency, and the disclosure of the existence of the records
could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, Components may, during only
such times as that circumstance continues, treat the records or information as not subject to the FOIA. In
such situation, the response to the requester will state that no records were found.

                                       C3.2.1.7.4.2. Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal
law enforcement organization within a DoD Component under the informant's name or personal
identifier are requested by a third party using the informant's name or personal identifier, the Component
may treat the records as not subject to the FOIA, unless the informant's status as an informant has been
officially confirmed. If it is determined that the records are not subject to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7) (reference
(a)), the response to the requester will state that no records were found.

               C3.2.1.8. Number 8. (5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(8) (reference (a)). Those contained in or related to
examination, operation or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of any agency
responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.

              C3.2.1.9. Number 9. (5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(9) (reference (a)). Those containing geological
and geophysical information and data (including maps) concerning wells.

                                              C4. Chapter 4

                                      FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

C4.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

         C4.1.1. General. Information that has not been given a security classification pursuant to the
criteria of an Executive Order, but which may be withheld from the public because disclosure would
cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more FOIA exemptions 2 through 9 (see
Chapter 3) shall be considered as being for official use only (FOUO). No other material shall be
considered FOUO and FOUO is not authorized as an anemic form of classification to protect national
security interests. Additional information on FOUO and other controlled, unclassified information may
be found in reference (g) or by contacting the Directorate for Security, Office of the Assistant Secretary
of Defense (Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence).

        C4.1.2. Prior FOUO Application. The prior application of FOUO markings is not a conclusive
basis for withholding a record that is requested under the FOIA. When such a record is requested, the
information in it shall be evaluated to determine whether disclosure would result in a foreseeable harm
to an interest protected by one or more FOIA exemptions 2 through 9. Even if any exemptions apply, the
record shall be released as a discretionary matter when it is determined that there is no foreseeable harm
to an interest protected by the exemptions.

        C4.1.3. Historical Papers. Records such as notes, working papers, and drafts retained as
historical evidence of DoD Component actions enjoy no special status apart from the exemptions under
the FOIA (reference (a)).

        C4.1.4. Time to Mark Records. The marking of records at the time of their creation provides
notice of FOUO content and facilitates review when a record is requested under the FOIA. Records
requested under the FOIA that do not bear such markings shall not be assumed to be releasable without
examination for the presence of information that requires continued protection and qualifies as exempt
from public release.

       C4.1.5. Distribution Statement. Information in a technical document that requires a distribution
statement pursuant to DoD Directive 5230.24 (reference (x)) shall bear that statement and may be
marked FOUO, as appropriate.

C4.2. MARKINGS

       C4.2.1. Location of Markings

              C4.2.1.1. An unclassified document containing FOUO information shall be marked "For
Official Use Only" at the bottom on the outside of the front cover (if any), on each page containing
FOUO information, and on the outside of the back cover (if any). Each paragraph containing FOUO
information shall be marked as such.

                C4.2.1.2. Within a classified document, an individual page that contains both FOUO and
classified information shall be marked at the top and bottom with the highest security classification of
information appearing on the page. Individual paragraphs shall be marked at the appropriate
classification level, as well as unclassified or FOUO, as appropriate.

                                                    48
                C4.2.1.3. Within a classified document, an individual page that contains FOUO
information but no classified information shall be marked "For Official Use Only" at the top and bottom
of the page, as well as each paragraph that contains FOUO information.

               C4.2.1.4. Other records, such as photographs, films, tapes, or slides, shall be marked "For
Official Use Only" or "FOUO" in a manner that ensures that a recipient or viewer is aware of the status
of the information therein.

               C4.2.1.5. FOUO material transmitted outside the Department of Defense requires
application of an expanded marking to explain the significance of the FOUO marking. This may be
accomplished by typing or stamping the following statement on the record prior to transfer:

               This document contains information
               EXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE
               under the FOIA. Exemption(s)….. applies/apply.

              C4.2.1.5. (AF) Record owners may also add the following sentence to the statement
above: “(Further distribution is prohibited without the approval of (owner’s organization, office symbol,
phone).)”

C4.3. DISSEMINATION AND TRANSMISSION

       C4.3.1. Release and Transmission Procedures. Until FOUO status is terminated, the release and
transmission instructions that follow apply:

               C4.3.1.1. FOUO information may be disseminated within DoD Components and between
officials of DoD Components and DoD contractors, consultants, and grantees to conduct official
business for the Department of Defense. Recipients shall be made aware of the status of such
information, and transmission shall be by means that preclude unauthorized public disclosure.
Transmittal documents shall call attention to the presence of FOUO attachments.

               C4.3.1.1. (AF) When deciding whether to send FOUO records over facsimile equipment,
balance the sensitivity of the records against the risk of disclosure. When faxing, use cover sheets to
indicate FOUO attachments (i.e., AF Form 3227, Privacy Act Cover Sheet, for Privacy Act information).
Consider the location of sending and receiving machines and ensure authorized personnel are available
to receive FOUO information as soon as it is transmitted.

                 C4.3.1.2. DoD holders of FOUO information are authorized to convey such information
to officials in other Departments and Agencies of the Executive and Judicial Branches to fulfill a
government function, except to the extent prohibited by the Privacy Act. Records thus transmitted shall
be marked “For Official Use Only,” and the recipient shall be advised that the information may qualify
for exemption from public disclosure, pursuant to the FOIA, and that special handling instructions do or
do not apply.

                C4.3.1.3. Release of FOUO information to Members of Congress is governed by DoD
Directive 5400.4 (reference (y)). Release to the GAO is governed by DoD Directive 7650.1 (reference
(z)). Records released to the Congress or GAO should be reviewed to determine whether the information
warrants FOUO status. If not, prior FOUO markings shall be removed or effaced. If withholding criteria
are met, the records shall be marked FOUO and the recipient provided an explanation for such
                                                   49
exemption and marking. Alternatively, the recipient may be requested, without marking the record, to
protect against its public disclosure for reasons that are explained.

                C4.3.1.3. (AF) For Privacy Act records, refer to AFI 33-332 for specific disclosure rules.
For releases to GAO and Congress, refer to AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations With Congress and AFI
65-401, Relations With the General Accounting Office.

        C4.3.2. Transporting FOUO Information. Records containing FOUO information shall be
transported in a manner that prevents disclosure of the contents. When not commingled with classified
information, FOUO information may be sent via first-class mail or parcel post. Bulky shipments, such as
distributions of FOUO Directives or testing materials, that otherwise qualify under postal regulations,
may be sent by fourth-class mail.

       C4.3.3. Electronically and Facsimile Transmitted Messages. Each part of electronically and
facsimile transmitted messages containing FOUO information shall be marked appropriately.
Unclassified messages containing FOUO information shall contain the abbreviation "FOUO" before the
beginning of the text. Such messages and facsimiles shall be transmitted in accordance with
communications security procedures whenever practicable.

C4.4. SAFEGUARDING FOUO INFORMATION

       C4.4.1. During Duty Hours. During normal working hours, records determined to be FOUO shall
be placed in an out-of-sight location if the work area is accessible to non-government personnel.

        C4.4.2. During Nonduty Hours. At the close of business, FOUO records shall be stored so as to
prevent unauthorized access. Filing such material with other unclassified records in unlocked files or
desks, etc., is adequate when normal U.S. Government or Government contractor internal building
security is provided during nonduty hours. When such internal security control is not exercised, locked
buildings or rooms normally provide adequate after-hours protection. If such protection is not
considered adequate, FOUO material shall be stored in locked receptacles such as file cabinets, desks, or
bookcases. FOUO records that are subject to the provisions of the National Security Act of 1959
(reference (aa)) shall meet the safeguards outlined for that group of records.

C4.5. TERMINATION, DISPOSAL AND UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES

        C4.5.1. Termination. The originator or other competent authority; e.g., initial denial and
appellate authorities, shall terminate "For Official Use Only" markings or status when circumstances
indicate that the information no longer requires protection from public disclosure. When FOUO status is
terminated, all known holders shall be notified, to the extent practical. Upon notification, holders shall
efface or remove the "For Official Use Only" markings, but records in file or storage need not be
retrieved solely for that purpose.

       C4.5.2. Disposal

                C4.5.2.1. Nonrecord copies of FOUO materials may be destroyed by tearing each copy
into pieces to prevent reconstructing, and placing them in regular trash containers. When local
circumstances or experience indicates that this destruction method is not sufficiently protective of
FOUO information, local authorities may direct other methods but must give due consideration to the
additional expense balanced against the degree of sensitivity of the type of FOUO information contained
in the records.
                                                    50
               C4.5.2.2. Record copies of FOUO documents shall be disposed of in accordance with the
disposal standards established under 44 U.S.C. 3301-3314 (reference (ab)), as implemented by DoD
Component instructions concerning records disposal.

                C4.5.2.2. (AF) You may recycle FOUO material. Safeguard the FOUO documents or
information to prevent unauthorized disclosure until recycling. Recycling contracts must include specific
responsibilities and requirements on protecting and destroying FOUO and Privacy Act materials.

                C4.5.3. Unauthorized Disclosure. The unauthorized disclosure of FOUO records does not
constitute an unauthorized disclosure of DoD information classified for security purposes. Appropriate
administrative action shall be taken, however, to fix responsibility for unauthorized disclosure whenever
feasible, and appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against those responsible. Unauthorized
disclosure of FOUO information that is protected by the Privacy Act (reference (d)) may also result in
civil and criminal sanctions against responsible persons. The DoD Component that originated the FOUO
information shall be informed of its unauthorized disclosure.




                                                   51
                                               C5. Chapter 5

                            RELEASE AND PROCESSING PROCEDURES

C5.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

       C5.1.1. Public Information

               C5.1.1.1. Since the policy of the Department of Defense is to make the maximum amount
of information available to the public consistent with its other responsibilities, written requests for a
DoD record made under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(3) (reference (a)) of the FOIA may be denied
only when:

                       C5.1.1.1.1. Disclosure would result in a foreseeable harm to an interest
protected by a FOIA exemption, and the record is subject to one or more of the exemptions of the FOIA.

                        C5.1.1.1.2. The record has not been described well enough to enable the DoD
Component to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort by an employee familiar with the files.

                         C5.1.1.1.3. The requester has failed to comply with the procedural
requirements, including the written agreement to pay or payment of any required fee imposed by the
instructions of the DoD Component concerned. When personally identifiable information in a record is
requested by the subject of the record or the subject’s attorney, notarization of the request, or a statement
certifying under the penalty of perjury that their identity is true and correct may be required.
Additionally, written consent of the subject of the record is required for disclosure from a Privacy Act
System of records, even to the subject’s attorney.

               C5.1.1.2. Individuals seeking DoD information should address their FOIA requests to one
of the addresses listed in Appendix AP2.

                C5.1.1.2. (AF) Individuals seeking Air Force information should address requests to an
address listed in Appendix 2. MAJCOM FOIA office phone numbers and mailing addresses are
available on the Air Force FOIA Web Page at http://www.foia.af.mil.

                          C5.1.1.2.1. (Added)(AF) A list of Air Force FOIA processing steps, from
receipt of the request through the final disposition of an administrative appeal, is at Appendix 9, which
also includes guidance on preparing and processing an Air Force FOIA appeal package.

                         C5.1.1.2.2. (Added)(AF) Air Force Host Tenant Relationships. The Air Force
host base FOIA manager may log, process, and report FOIA requests for Air Force tenant units. In such
cases, the host base FOIA office refers all recommended denials and “no records” appeals to the Air
Force tenant MAJCOM FOIA manager. This does not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG), Air
Force Reserves, or to disclosure authorities for specialized records.

        C5.1.2. Requests from Private Parties. The provisions of the FOIA are reserved for persons with
private interests as opposed to U.S. Federal Agencies seeking official information. Requests from
private persons will be made in writing, and should clearly show all other addressees within the Federal
Government to which the request was also sent. This procedure will reduce processing time
requirements, and ensure better inter- and intra-agency coordination. However, if the requester does not
show all other addressees to which the request was also sent, DoD Components shall still process the
                                                     52
request. DoD Components should encourage requesters to send requests by mail, facsimile, or by
electronic means. Disclosure of records to individuals under the FOIA is considered public release of
information, except as provided for in subsections C1.5.6. and C3.2.1., above.

       C5.1.2. (AMC) Do not allow requesters to review files in order to select documents. Use
sample letter at Appendix 20 to notify them of the requirement to process records under FOIA
prior to allowing access to government records.

        C5.1.3. Requests from Government Officials. Requests from officials of State or local
Governments for DoD Component records shall be considered the same as any other requester. Requests
from members of Congress not seeking records on behalf of a Congressional Committee, Subcommittee,
either House sitting as a whole, or made on behalf of their constituents shall be considered the same as
any other requester (see also subsections C1.5.6., above and C5.1.4., below). Requests from officials of
foreign governments shall be considered the same as any other requester. Requests from officials of
foreign governments that do not invoke the FOIA shall be referred to appropriate foreign disclosure
channels and the requester so notified.

        C5.1.3. (AF) Use FOIA procedures in this supplement to process any congressional request
citing FOIA, or covering a constituent letter citing FOIA. This does not apply to requests from a
Congressional Committee or Subcommittee Chair on behalf of the committee or subcommittee.

       C5.1.4. Privileged Release Outside of the FOIA to U.S. Government Officials

                C5.1.4.1. Records exempt from release to the public under the FOIA may be disclosed in
accordance with DoD Component regulations to agencies of the Federal Government, whether
legislative, executive, or administrative, as follows:

                         C5.1.4.1.1. In response to a request of a Committee or Subcommittee of
Congress, or to either House sitting as a whole in accordance with DoD Directive 5400.4 (reference (y));

                        C5.1.4.1.2. To other Federal Agencies, both executive and administrative, as
determined by the head of a DoD Component or designee;

                         C5.1.4.1.3. In response to an order of a Federal court, DoD Components shall
release information along with a description of the restrictions on its release to the public;

                C5.1.4.2. DoD Components shall inform officials receiving records under the provisions
of this paragraph that those records are exempt from public release under the FOIA. DoD Components
also shall advise officials of any special handling instructions. Classified information is subject to the
provisions of DoD 5200.1-R (reference (g)), and information contained in Privacy Act systems of
records is subject to DoD 5400.11-R (reference (v)).

       C5.1.5. Consultation with Affected DoD Component

               C5.1.5.1. When a DoD Component receives a FOIA request for a record in which an
affected DoD organization (including a Combatant Command) has a clear and substantial interest in the
subject matter, consultation with that affected DoD organization is required. As an example, where a
DoD Component receives a request for records related to DoD operations in a foreign country, the
cognizant Combatant Command for the area involved in the request shall be consulted before a release is
made. Consultations may be telephonic, electronic, or in hard copy.
                                                    53
                C5.1.5.2. The affected DoD Component shall review the circumstances of the request for
host- nation relations, and provide, where appropriate, FOIA processing assistance to the responding
DoD Component regarding release of information. Responding DoD Components shall provide copies
of responsive records to the affected DoD Component when requested by the affected DoD Component.
The affected DoD Component shall receive a courtesy copy of all releases in such circumstances.

                 C5.1.5.3. Nothing in the above paragraphs shall impede the processing of the FOIA
request initially received by a DoD Component.

       C5.1.6. (Added)(AMC) Processing Procedures for Inspector General (IG) Records:

               C5.1.6.1. (Added)(AMC) Base FOIA managers will: Receive and log in the request,
then forward the request to the base IG office for action. Note: The FOIA manager will not
physically handle the requested IG records. Process records identified as non-IG records as usual,
if applicable.

               C5.1.6.2. (Added)(AMC) Base IG personnel will: Locate the records and contact HQ
AMC/IGQ to determine further processing requirements. Forward a copy of the documents
directly to HQ AMC/IGQ in accordance with their guidance. (Note: If the base IG personnel
receive the request directly, they will immediately notify the base FOIA office.)

             C5.1.6.3. (Added)(AMC) Base FOIA managers will: Prepare a referral
memorandum to HQ AMC/A6OBR (FOIA) and a response to the requester. The referral
memorandum should detail all actions taken on the non-IG records and include the date the base
IG forwarded the records to HQ AMC/IGQ. FOIA Managers will provide copies of all supporting
documentation and an index of non-IG released records. Note: Even though IG records do not go
through the base FOIA office, the request will always be processed as a referral.

              C5.1.6.4. (Added)(AMC) The MAJCOM FOIA manager will: Continue to process
FOIA requests for HQ AMC/IG records in the usual manner. On completion of the case, the
MAJCOM FOIA manager will provide HQ AMC/IGQ with an info copy of the legal review, final
response, and all copies of IG records for file. On appeals, the MAJCOM FOIA manager will
forward the appeal to HQ AMC/IGQ for action. HQ AMC/IGQ will review the appeal and make a
recommendation for inclusion in the appeal package to AFLSA/JACL.

C5.2. INITIAL DETERMINATIONS

       C5.2.1. Initial Denial Authority

               C5.2.1.1. Components shall limit the number of IDAs appointed. In designating its IDAs,
a DoD Component shall balance the goals of centralization of authority to promote uniform decisions
and decentralization to facilitate responding to each request within the time limitations of the FOIA.

              C5.2.1.1. (AF) See paragraph C1.4.5 for the expanded definition of Air Force IDAs, and
paragraph C1.5.3.5 for responsibilities of Air Force IDAs.

               C5.2.1.2. The initial determination whether to make a record available upon request may
be made by any suitable official designated by the DoD Component in published regulations. The
presence of the marking "For Official Use Only" does not relieve the designated official of the

                                                  54
responsibility to review the requested record for the purpose of determining whether an exemption under
the FOIA is applicable.

                C5.2.1.2. (AF) Disclosure Authorities make final decisions on providing releasable
records within the time limits and provide recommendations to the IDA on proposed denials and partial
denials after coordination with the appropriate FOIA and JA office. Normally disclosure authorities are
division chiefs or higher at Air Staff level. MAJCOMs will designate their disclosure authority levels.
The level should be high enough so a responsible authority makes the disclosure according to the
policies outlined in this supplement. At out sourced units or functions, the disclosure authority must be a
government official. Contractors who are functional OPRs for official government records are not
authorized to make the decision to disclose government records.

                C5.2.1.2. (AMC) Disclosure authority for records within their jurisdiction is
delegated to the command records manager; to commanders and vice commanders at numbered
Air Force and wing levels; to commanders and deputy commanders at group level, and to
commanders, vice commanders, or deputy commanders at unit reporting directly to AMC
headquarters. This can also be delegated to the group level at the base by local supplement. A
letter identifying each disclosure authority will be forwarded to HQ AMC/A6OBR. Release letters
to requesters, as well as letters recommending denial/partial denial submitted to HQ
AMC/A6OBR will be signed by the disclosure authority.

                C5.2.1.3. The officials designated by DoD Components to make initial determinations
should consult with public affairs officers (PAOs) to become familiar with subject matter that is
considered to be newsworthy, and advise PAOs of all requests from news media representatives. In
addition, the officials should inform PAOs in advance when they intend to withhold or partially
withhold a record, if it appears that the withholding action may be challenged in the media.

               C5.2.1.3. (AF) On receipt, Air Force FOIA offices will promptly inform Air Force PAOs
of all FOIA requests that are potentially newsworthy, or that are submitted by news media requesters.
FOIA offices will coordinate final replies for such cases with public affairs.

       C5.2.2. Reasons for Not Releasing a Record. The following are reasons for not complying with a
request for a record under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) (reference (a)):

               C5.2.2.1. No Records. A reasonable search of files failed to identify responsive records.

             C5.2.2.2. Referrals. The request is transferred to another DoD Component, or to another
Federal Agency.

               C5.2.2.3. Request Withdrawn. The request is withdrawn by the requester.

               C5.2.2.4. Fee-Related Reason. The requester is unwilling to pay fees associated with a
request; the requester is past due in the payment of fees from a previous FOIA request; or the requester
disagrees with the fee estimate.

                C5.2.2.5. Records not Reasonably Described. A record has not been described with
sufficient particularity to enable the DoD Component to locate it by conducting a reasonable search.



                                                    55
              C5.2.2.6. Not a Proper FOIA Request for Some Other Reason. The requester has failed
unreasonably to comply with procedural requirements, other than fee-related, imposed by this
Regulation or DoD Component supplementing regulations.

              C5.2.2.7. Not an Agency Record. The information requested is not a record within the
meaning of the FOIA and this Regulation.

                C5.2.2.8. Duplicate Request. The request is a duplicate request (e.g., a requester asks for
the same information more than once). This includes identical requests received via different means
(e.g., electronic mail, facsimile, mail, courier) at the same or different times.

               C5.2.2.9. Other (Specify). Any other reason a requester does not comply with published
rules other than those outlined above.

              C5.2.2.10. Partial or Total Denial. The record is denied in whole or in part in accordance
with procedures set forth in the FOIA.

               C5.2.2.10. (AMC) FOIA managers will refer partial and full denial packages to HQ
AMC/A6OBR (FOIA). The denial packages must have a cover memorandum signed by the
designated disclosure authority, outlining all actions taken up to the date of referral, to include all
unusual circumstances. All referral letters must include the statement: “These records (were/were
not) retrieved from Privacy Act System #________ by (individual’s name or personal identifier).”
Attachments will be identified on the cover memorandum and each attachment will be tabbed
separately.

        C5.2.3. Denial Tests. To deny a requested record that is in the possession and control of a DoD
Component, it must be determined that disclosure of the record would result in a foreseeable harm to an
interest protected by a FOIA exemption, and the record is exempt under one or more of the exemptions
of the FOIA. An outline of the FOIA’s exemptions is contained in Chapter 3 of this Regulation.

        C5.2.4. Reasonably Segregable Portions. Although portions of some records may be denied, the
remaining reasonably segregable portions must be released to the requester when it reasonably can be
assumed that a skillful and knowledgeable person could not reconstruct the excised information. Unless
indicating the extent of the deletion would harm an interest protected by an exemption, the amount of
deleted information shall be indicated on the released portion of paper records by use of brackets or
darkened areas indicating removal of information. In no case shall the deleted areas be left “white”
without the use of brackets to show the bounds of deleted information. In the case of electronic deletion,
or deletion in audiovisual or microfiche records, if technically feasible, the amount of redacted
information shall be indicated at the place in the record such deletion was made, unless including the
indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption under which the deletion is made. This
may be done by use of brackets, shaded areas, or some other identifiable technique that will clearly
show the limits of the deleted information. When a record is denied in whole, the response advising the
requester of that determination will specifically state that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the
record for release.

       C5.2.4. (AF) Delete information exempt from release under the FOIA from copies of otherwise
releasable records. Do not release copies that would permit the requester to “read through the marking."
Examples of records with deletions of exempted data are in Appendix 10.

       C5.2.5. Response to Requester.
                                                      56
                 C5.2.5.1. Whenever possible, initial determinations to release or deny a record normally
shall be made and the decision reported to the requester within 20 working days after receipt of the
request by the official designated to respond. When a DoD Component has a significant number of
pending requests which prevent a response determination within the 20 working day period, the
requester shall be so notified in an interim response, and advised whether their request qualifies for the
fast track or slow track within the DoD Components’ multitrack processing system. Requesters who do
not meet the criteria for fast track processing shall be given the opportunity to limit the scope of their
request in order to qualify for fast track processing. See also subsection C5.1.4. above, for greater detail
on multitrack processing and compelling need meriting expedited processing.

                C5.2.5.1. (AF) A request is officially received when it is received by the FOIA office of
the activity responsible for the records. See also paragraphs C1.5.3.7 and C1.5.4.2. Examples of interim
response letters to requesters are included in Appendix 7.

              C5.2.5.1. (AMC) FOIA Managers will notify the MAJCOM FOIA office upon
receipt of requests involving media attention or matters of national interest.

               C5.2.5.2. When a decision is made to release a record, a copy should be made available
promptly to the requester once he has complied with preliminary procedural requirements.

                C5.2.5.3. When a request for a record is denied in whole or in part, the official designated
to respond shall inform the requester in writing of the name and title or position of the official who made
the determination, and shall explain to the requester the basis for the 66 determination in sufficient detail
to permit the requester to make a decision concerning appeal. The requester specifically shall be
informed of the exemptions on which the denial is based, inclusive of a brief statement describing what
the exemption(s) cover. When the initial denial is based in whole or in part on a security classification,
the explanation should include a summary of the applicable Executive Order criteria for classification,
as well as an explanation, to the extent reasonably feasible, of how those criteria apply to the particular
record in question. The requester shall also be advised of the opportunity and procedures for appealing
an unfavorable determination to a higher final authority within the DoD Component.

              C5.2.5.3. (AF) See also paragraph C3.2.1.1.2 for more detail on Air Force procedures for
processing FOIA requests for classified records.

                C5.2.5.4. The final response to the requester should contain information concerning the
fee status of the request, consistent with the provisions of Chapter 6, this Regulation. When a requester
is assessed fees for processing a request, the requester’s fee category shall be specified in the response
letter. Components also shall provide the requester with a complete cost breakdown (e.g., 15 pages of
office reproduction at $0.15 per page; 5 minutes of computer search time at $43.50 per minute, 2 hours
of professional level search at $25 per hour, etc.) in the response letter.

                C5.2.5.5. The explanation of the substantive basis for a denial shall include specific
citation of the statutory exemption applied under provisions of this Regulation; e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(1)
(reference (a)). Merely referring to a classification; to a "For Official Use Only" marking on the
requested record; or to this Regulation or a DoD Component's regulation does not constitute a proper
citation or explanation of the basis for invoking an exemption.

                C5.2.5.6. When the time for response becomes an issue, the official responsible for
replying shall acknowledge to the requester the date of the receipt of the request.

                                                     57
                C5.2.5.7. When denying a request for records, in whole or in part, a DoD Component
shall make a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of the records denied and provide this estimate to
the requester, unless providing such an estimate would harm an interest protected by an exemption of
the FOIA. This estimate should be in number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation,
unless the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part.

              C5.2.5.8. When denying a request for records in accordance with a statute qualifying as a
FOIA exemption 3 statute, DoD Components shall, in addition to stating the particular statute relied
upon to deny the information, also state whether a court has upheld the decision to withhold the
information under the particular statute, and a concise description of the scope of the information being
withheld.

       C5.2.6. Extension of Time

                 C5.2.6.1. In unusual circumstances, when additional time is needed to respond to the
initial request, the DoD Component shall acknowledge the request in writing within the 20 day period,
describe the circumstances requiring the delay, and indicate the anticipated date for a substantive
response that may not exceed 10 additional working days, except as provided below:

                C5.2.6.2. With respect to a request for which a written notice has extended the time limits
by 10 additional working days, and the Component determines that it cannot make a response
determination within that additional 10 working day period, the requester shall be notified and provided
an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within the extended time
limit, or an opportunity to arrange an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified
request. Refusal by the requester to reasonably modify the request or arrange for an alternative time
frame shall be considered a factor in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist with respect
to DoD Components’ request backlogs. Exceptional circumstances do not include a delay that results
from predictable component backlogs, unless the DoD Component demonstrates reasonable progress in
reducing its backlog.

                C5.2.6.2. (AF) See paragraph C1.5.4.1 for examples of interim letters to a requester
proposing they modify their request and/or to arrange an alternate time frame for responding to the
request are included in Appendix 7.

               C5.2.6.3. Unusual circumstances that may justify delay are:

                            C5.2.6.3.1. The need to search for and collect the requested records from other
facilities that are separate from the office determined responsible for a release or denial decision on the
requested information.

                       C5.2.6.3.2. The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are requested in a single request.

                         C5.2.6.3.3. The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all
practicable speed, with other agencies having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or
among two or more DoD Components having a substantial subject-matter interest in the request.

                         C5.2.6.3.4. DoD Components may aggregate certain requests by the same
requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, if the DoD Component reasonably believes that
such requests actually constitute a single request, which would otherwise satisfy the unusual
                                                    58
circumstances set forth above, and the requests involve clearly related matters. Multiple requests
involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated. If the requests are aggregated under these
conditions, the requester or requesters shall be so notified.

                            C5.2.6.3.5. In cases where the statutory time limits cannot be met and no
informal extension of time has been agreed to, the inability to process any part of the request within the
specified time should be explained to the requester with a request that he agree to await a substantive
response by an anticipated date. It should be made clear that any such agreement does not prejudice the
right of the requester to appeal the initial decision after it is made. DoD Components are reminded that
the requester still retains the right to treat this delay as a defacto denial with full administrative remedies.

                         C5.2.6.3.6. As an alternative to the taking of formal extensions of time as
described in subsection C5.2.6. above, the negotiation by the cognizant FOIA coordinating office of
informal extensions in time with requesters is encouraged where appropriate.

       C5.2.7. Misdirected Requests. Misdirected requests shall be forwarded promptly to the DoD
Component or other Federal Agency with the responsibility for the records requested. The period
allowed for responding to the request misdirected by the requester shall not begin until the request is
received by the DoD Component that manages the records requested.

        C5.2.8. Records of Non-U.S. Government Source

                C5.2.8.1. When a request is received for a record that falls under exemption 4 (see
subsection Number 4 of Chapter 3, above), that was obtained from a non-U.S. Government source, or
for a record containing information clearly identified as having been provided by a non-U.S.
Government source, the source of the record or information [also known as "the submitter" for matters
pertaining to proprietary data under 5 U.S.C. 552 (reference (a)) Exemption (b)(4)] [Chapter 3, section
2, subsection C3.2.1., Number 4, this Regulation and E. O. 12600 (reference (ac)),] shall be notified
promptly of that request and afforded reasonable time (e.g., 30 calendar days) to present any objections
concerning the release, unless it is clear that there can be no valid basis for objection. This practice is
required for those FOIA requests for data not deemed clearly exempt from disclosure under exemption
(b)(4) of reference (a). If, for example, the record or information was provided with actual or
presumptive knowledge of the non-U.S. Government source and established that it would be made
available to the public upon request, there is no obligation to notify the source. Any objections shall be
evaluated. The final decision to disclose information claimed to be exempt under exemption (b)(4) shall
be made by an official equivalent in rank to the official who would make the decision to withhold that
information under the FOIA. When a substantial issue has been raised, the DoD Component may seek
additional information from the source of the information and afford the source and requester reasonable
opportunities to present their arguments on the legal and substantive issues involved prior to making an
agency determination. When the source advises it will seek a restraining order or take court action to
prevent release of the record or information, the requester shall be notified, and action on the request
normally shall not be taken until after the outcome of that court action is known. When the requester
brings court action to compel disclosure, the submitter shall be promptly notified of this action.

                C5.2.8.1. (AF) The Air Force, in compliance with Executive Order 12600, will advise
submitters of contractor-submitted records when a FOIA requester seeks the release of such records,
regardless of any initial determination as to whether FOIA exemption (b)(4) applies. (See paragraph
C3.2.1.4.8. and Appendix 11.) Due to a change to the Title 48 CFR, submitter notification is not
required prior to release of unit prices contained in contracts awarded based upon solicitations issued

                                                      59
after 1 January 1998. For solicitations issued before 1 January 1998, conduct a normal submitter notice.
Unit prices contained in proposals provided prior to contract award are protected from release, as are all
portions of unsuccessful proposals (before and after contract award) (10 USC 2305(g)).

                C5.2.8.1. (AMC) Use sample letter at Appendix 21 to obtain views of
nongovernment sources. If the nongovernment source does not respond within the 30 calendar
days allowed, advise them of your decision to release and give the expected release date of 2 weeks
from the date of your letter. If the nongovernment source objects to release of their data, forward
the entire file to HQ AMC/A6OBR. All submitter notification letters will be sent via certified mail.

                 C5.2.8.2. If the submitted information is a proposal in response to a solicitation for a
competitive proposal, and the proposal is in the possession and control of DoD, and meets the
requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2305(g) (reference (p)), the proposal shall not be disclosed, and no submitter
notification and subsequent analysis is required. The proposal shall be withheld from public disclosure
pursuant to reference (p) and exemption (b)(3) of reference (a). This statute does not apply to bids,
unsolicited proposals, or any proposal that is set forth or incorporated by reference in a contract between
a DoD Component and the offeror that submitted the proposal. In such situations, normal submitter
notice shall be conducted in accordance with paragraph C5.2.8.1., above, except for sealed bids that are
opened and read to the public. The term proposal means information contained in or originating from
any proposal, including a technical, management, or cost proposal submitted by an offeror in response to
solicitation for a competitive proposal, but does not include an offeror’s name or total price or unit
prices when set forth in a record other than the proposal itself. Submitter notice, and analysis as
appropriate, are required for exemption (b)(4) matters that are not specifically incorporated in reference
(p).

                 C5.2.8.3. If the record or information was submitted on a strictly voluntary basis, absent
any exercised authority that prescribes criteria for submission, and after consultation with the submitter,
it is absolutely clear that the record or information would customarily not be released to the public, the
submitter need not be notified. Examples of exercised authorities prescribing criteria for submission are
statutes, Executive Orders, regulations, invitations for bids, requests for proposals, and contracts.
Records or information submitted under these authorities are not voluntary in nature. When it is not
clear whether the information was submitted on a voluntary basis, absent any exercised authority, and
whether it would customarily be released to the public by the submitter, notify the submitter and ask that
it describe its treatment of the information, and render an objective evaluation. If the decision is made to
release the information over the objection of the submitter, notify the submitter and afford the necessary
time to allow the submitter to seek a restraining order, or take court action to prevent release of the
record or information.

               C5.2.8.3. (AMC) The denial authority will sign letters releasing records over the
objection of any nongovernment source. HQ AMC/A6OBR will notify the nongovernment source
when the decision is made to release data over their objection. They will be given 10 workdays to
seek a restraining order. Use sample letter at Appendix 22. Notifications will be sent via certified
mail, return receipt requested. If a response is not received within that time, the information will
be released.

              C5.2.8.4. The coordination provisions of this paragraph also apply to any non-U.S.
Government record in the possession and control of the DoD from multi-national organizations, such as
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), United Nations Commands, the North American
Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), the Inter-American Defense Board, or foreign governments.
                                                    60
Coordination with foreign governments under the provisions of this paragraph may be made through
Department of State, or the specific foreign embassy.

                C5.2.8.4. (AF) Department of State Involvement. Air Force FOIA managers will notify
their MAJCOM (or equivalent) FOIA office, in writing, via fax or e-mail when the Department of State
becomes involved in any Air Force FOIA actions. The MAJCOM FOIA office will provide 11
CS/SCSR, via fax or e-mail, a summary of the issues involved, and the name, phone number, mailing
address and e-mail address of: their own FOIA office point of contact; the Air Force record OPR point
of contact, the DoD component FOIA office point of contact (if any), and the Department of State point
of contact. 11 CS/SCSR will inform SAF/IA of any State Department involvement in Air Force FOIA
actions. (See paragraph C1.5.5.2.) An example of a memo advising 11 CS/SCSR of State Department
involvement in an Air Force FOIA action is provided in Appendix 7.

        C5.2.9. File of Initial Denials. Copies of all initial denials shall be maintained by each DoD
Component in a form suitable for rapid retrieval, periodic statistical compilation, and management
evaluation. Records denied for any of the reasons contained in C5.2.2. shall be maintained for a period
of six years to meet the statute of limitations requirement.

        C5.2.10. Special Mail Services. Components are authorized to use registered mail, certified mail,
certificates of mailing and return receipts. However, their use should be limited to instances where it
appears advisable to establish proof of dispatch or receipt of FOIA correspondence. The requester shall
be notified that they are responsible for the full costs of special services.

         C5.2.11. Receipt Accounts. The Treasurer of the United States has established two accounts for
FOIA receipts, and all money orders or checks remitting FOIA fees should be made payable to the U.S.
Treasurer. These accounts, which are described in paragraphs C5.2.11.1. and C5.2.11.2., below, shall be
used for depositing all FOIA receipts, except receipts for Working Capital and non appropriated funded
activities. Components are reminded that the below account numbers must be preceded by the
appropriate disbursing office two digit prefix. Working Capital and non appropriated funded activity
FOIA receipts shall be deposited to the applicable fund.

               C5.2.11.1. Receipt Account 3210 Sale of Publications and Reproductions, Freedom of
Information Act (reference (ad)). This account shall be used when depositing funds received from
providing existing publications and forms that meet the Receipt Account Series description found in
Federal Account Symbols and Titles.

               C5.2.11.2. Receipt Account 3210 Fees and Other Charges for Services, Freedom of
Information Act (reference (ad)). This account is used to deposit search fees, fees for duplicating and
reviewing (in the case of commercial requesters) records to satisfy requests that could not be filled with
existing publications or forms.

C5.3. APPEALS

         C5.3.1. General. If the official designated by the DoD Component to make initial determinations
on requests for records declines to provide a record because the official considers it exempt under one or
more of the exemptions of the FOIA, that decision may be appealed by the requester, in writing, to a
designated appellate authority. The appeal should be accompanied by a copy of the letter denying the
initial request. Such appeals should contain the basis for disagreement with the initial refusal. Appeal
procedures also apply to the disapproval of a fee category claim by a requester, disapproval of a request
for waiver or reduction of fees, disputes regarding fee estimates, review on an expedited basis a
                                                      61
determination not to grant expedited access to agency records, for no record determinations when the
requester considers such responses adverse in nature, not providing a response determination to a FOIA
request within the statutory time limits, or any determination found to be adverse in nature by the
requester. When denials have been made under the provisions of the Privacy Act and the FOIA, and the
denied information is contained in a Privacy Act system of records, appeals shall be processed under
both the Privacy Act and the FOIA. If the denied information is not maintained in a Privacy Act system
of records, the appeal shall be processed under the FOIA. Appeals of Office of the Secretary of Defense
and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff determinations may be sent to the address in Appendix AP2,
paragraph AP2.2.1. If a request is merely misaddressed, and the receiving DoD Component simply
advises the requester of such and refers the request to the appropriate DoD Component, this shall not be
considered a no record determination.

        C5.3.1. (AF) FOIA requesters seeking Air Force records must address appeals to the Office of
the Secretary of the Air Force, through the FOIA office of the IDA that denied the request. Requesters
should attach a copy of the denial letter to their appeal and give reasons for appealing. Air Force IDAs
may reconsider any prior denials and may grant all or part of a requester’s appeal. When any appellate
action sought by a FOIA requester is denied by an IDA, the IDA will include a statement that the issues
raised in the appeal were considered and rejected (in full or in part) in any file sent to the Secretary of
the Air Force in the course of a FOIA appeal action. Send all appeals to IDA decisions at the wing level
through the MAJCOM FOIA office for sending to the Secretary of the Air Force’s designated appellate
authority, SAF/GCA (and Air Force Legal Services Agency [AFLSA/JACL]). (See paragraphs C1.4.6,
C1.5.3.1, and C1.5.3.8.) Additional steps are required prior to sending an appeal file.

               C5.3.1.1. (Added)(AF) MAJCOM FOIA offices and record OPRs are responsible for
ensuring adequate preparation of the FOIA appeal package for reconsideration by the IDA. FOIA offices
and records OPRs will coordinate with Air Force attorneys, who will provide written opinions on
substantive issues raised in the appeal.

               C5.3.1.2. (Added)(AF) If a requester appeals an Air Force “no records” determination,
Air Force elements must search again or verify the adequacy of their first search. The package must
include documents that show the Air Force element systematically tried to find responsive records. Tell,
for example, what areas or offices were searched and how the search was conducted--manually, by
computer, by telephone, and so forth. In the event a requester sues the Air Force to contest a
determination that no responsive records exist, formal affidavits are required to support the adequacy of
any searches conducted.

              C5.3.1.3. (Added)(AF) FOIA requesters seeking to appeal denials involving Office of
Personnel Management's controlled civilian personnel records must appeal to the Office of the General
Counsel, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW, Washington DC 20415.

               C5.3.1.4. (Added)(AF) If a requester appeals a denial of a fee waiver, fee estimate, or fee
reduction request, FOIA offices and record OPRs must account for actual and estimated costs of
processing a request, and will include copies of the DD Forms 2086 or 2086-1 in the appeal package.

               C5.3.1.5. (Added)(AF) When any appellate action sought by a FOIA requester is denied
by an IDA, prepare the FOIA appeal package as specified in Appendix 9, and then the MAJCOM FOIA
office forwards the appeal file to the Secretary of the Air Force’s designated appellate authority,
SAF/GCA (through AFLSA/JACL), for a final administrative determination.


                                                    62
       C5.3.2. Time of Receipt. A FOIA appeal has been received by a DoD Component when it
reaches the office of an appellate authority having jurisdiction. Misdirected appeals should be referred
expeditiously to the proper appellate authority.

       C5.3.2. (AF) Air Force activities will process appeal actions expeditiously to ensure they reach
the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force in a timely manner.

        C5.3.3. Time Limits

                C5.3.3.1. The requester shall be advised to file an appeal so that it is postmarked no later
than 60 calendar days after the date of the initial denial letter. If no appeal is received, or if the appeal is
postmarked after the conclusion of this 60-day period, the appeal may be considered closed. However,
exceptions to the above may be considered on a case by case basis. In cases where the requester is
provided several incremental determinations for a single request, the time for the appeal shall not begin
until the date of the final response. Records that are denied shall be retained for a period of six years to
meet the statute of limitations requirement.

                C5.3.3.1. (AF) Any FOIA appeals received after the 60-day time limit are not processed,
unless the requester provides adequate justification for failing to comply with the time limit. If a late
appeal is received, and there is no adequate justification for failing to comply with the time limit, the
FOIA office will advise the FOIA requester their appeal has been closed. An example of a closure letter
is included in Appendix 7.

                C5.3.3.2. Final determinations on appeals normally shall be made within 20 working days
after receipt. When a DoD Component has a significant number of appeals preventing a response
determination within 20 working days, the appeals shall be processed in a multitrack processing system,
based at a minimum, on the three processing tracks established for initial requests. See subsection
C1.5.4. above, this Regulation. All of the provisions of C1.5.4. apply also to appeals of initial
determinations, to include establishing additional processing queues as needed.

              C5.3.3.2. (AF) Appendix 7 includes examples of letters to FOIA requesters who have
appealed any Air Force denial action taken on their requests.

        C5.3.4. Delay in Responding to an Appeal

               C5.3.4.1. If additional time is needed due to the unusual circumstances described in
subsection C5.2.6., above, the final decision may be delayed for the number of working days (not to
exceed 10), that were not used as additional time for responding to the initial request.

                C5.3.4.2. If a determination cannot be made and the requester notified within 20 working
days, the appellate authority shall acknowledge to the requester, in writing, the date of receipt of the
appeal, the circumstances surrounding the delay, and the anticipated date for substantive response.
Requesters shall be advised that, if the delay exceeds the statutory extension provision or is for reasons
other than the unusual circumstances identified in subsection C5.2.6., above, they may consider their
administrative remedies exhausted. They may, however, without prejudicing their right of judicial
remedy, await a substantive response. The DoD Component shall continue to process the case
expeditiously.



                                                       63
               C5.3.4.2. (AF) For an appeal in process and not yet forwarded to AFLSA/JACL, the
MAJCOM FOIA office is responsible for advising the requester of the status of the appeal. For an
appeal in process at AFLSA/JACL, that office will advise the requester regarding status of the appeal.

          C5.3.5. Response to the Requester

               C5.3.5.1. When an appellate authority makes a final determination to release all or a
portion of records withheld by an IDA, a written response and a copy of the records so released should
be forwarded promptly to the requester after compliance with any preliminary procedural requirements,
such as payment of fees.

               C5.3.5.2. Final refusal of an appeal must be made in writing by the appellate authority or
by a designated representative. The response, at a minimum, shall include the following:

                         C5.3.5.2.1. The basis for the refusal shall be explained to the requester in
writing, both with regard to the applicable statutory exemption or exemptions invoked under provisions
of the FOIA, and with respect to other appeal matters as set forth in subsection C5.3.1., above.

                          C5.3.5.2.2. When the final refusal is based in whole or in part on a security
classification, the explanation shall include a determination that the record meets the cited criteria and
rationale of the governing Executive Order, and that this determination is based on a declassification
review, with the explanation of how that review confirmed the continuing validity of the security
classification.

                           C5.3.5.2.3. The final denial shall include the name and title or position of the
official responsible for the denial.

                          C5.3.5.2.4. In the case of appeals for total denial of records, the response shall
advise the requester that the information being denied does not contain meaningful portions that are
reasonably segregable.

                          C5.3.5.2.5. When the denial is based upon an exemption 3 statute (see
subsection Number 3 of Chapter 3), the response, in addition to citing the statute relied upon to deny the
information, shall state whether a court has upheld the decision to withhold the information under the
statute, and shall contain a concise description of the scope of the information withheld.

                          C5.3.5.2.6. The response shall advise the requester of the right to judicial
review.

          C5.3.6. Consultation

              C5.3.6.1. Final refusal involving issues not previously resolved or that the DoD
Component knows to be inconsistent with rulings of other DoD Components ordinarily should not be
made before consultation with the DoD Office of the General Counsel.

                C5.3.6.2. Tentative decisions to deny records that raise new or significant legal issues of
potential significance to other Agencies of the Government shall be provided to the DoD Office of the
General Counsel.

C5.4. JUDICIAL ACTIONS
                                                     64
       C5.4.1. General

               C5.4.1.1. This section states current legal and procedural rules for the convenience of the
reader. The statements of rules do not create rights or remedies not otherwise available, nor do they bind
the Department of Defense to particular judicial interpretations or procedures.

                C5.4.1.2. A requester may seek an order from a U.S. District Court to compel release of a
record after administrative remedies have been exhausted; i.e., when refused a record by the head of a
Component or an appellate designee or when the DoD Component has failed to respond within the time
limits prescribed by the FOIA and in this Regulation.

       C5.4.2. Jurisdiction. The requester may bring suit in the U.S. District Court in the district in
which the requester resides or is the requesters place of business, in the district in which the record is
located, or in the District of Columbia.

       C5.4.3. Burden of Proof. The burden of proof is on the DoD Component to justify its refusal to
provide a record. The court shall evaluate the case de novo (anew) and may elect to examine any
requested record in camera (in private) to determine whether the denial was justified.

       C5.4.4. Actions by the Court

                C5.4.4.1. When a DoD Component has failed to make a determination within the
statutory time limits but can demonstrate due diligence in exceptional circumstances, to include
negotiating with the requester to modify the scope of their request, the court may retain jurisdiction and
allow the Component additional time to complete its review of the records.

              C5.4.4.2. If the court determines that the requester's complaint is substantially correct, it
may require the United States to pay reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs.

                C5.4.4.3. When the court orders the release of denied records, it may also issue a written
finding that the circumstances surrounding the withholding raise questions whether DoD Component
personnel acted arbitrarily and capriciously. In these cases, the special counsel of the Merit System
Protection Board shall conduct an investigation to determine whether or not disciplinary action is
warranted. The DoD Component is obligated to take the action recommended by the special counsel.

             C5.4.4.4. The court may punish the responsible official for contempt when a DoD
Component fails to comply with the court order to produce records that it determines have been withheld
improperly.

        C5.4.5. Non-United States Government Source Information. A requester may bring suit in a U.S.
District Court to compel the release of records obtained from a non-government source or records based
on information obtained from a non- government source. Such source shall be notified promptly of the
court action. When the source advises that it is seeking court action to prevent release, the DoD
Component shall defer answering or otherwise pleading to the complainant as long as permitted by the
Court or until a decision is rendered in the court action of the source, whichever is sooner.

      C5.4.6. FOIA Litigation. Personnel responsible for processing FOIA requests at the DoD
Component level shall be aware of litigation under the FOIA. Such information will provide
management insights into the use of the nine exemptions by Component personnel. Whenever a
complaint under the FOIA is filed in a U.S. District Court, the DoD Component named in the complaint
                                                     65
shall forward a copy of the complaint by any means to the Director, Freedom of Information and
Security Review with an information copy to the DoD Office of the General Counsel, ATTN: Office of
Legal Counsel.

                                               C6. Chapter 6

                                            FEE SCHEDULE

C6.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

         C6.1.1. Authorities. The Freedom of Information Act (reference (a)), as amended; the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) (reference (ae) ), as amended; the Privacy Act of 1974 (reference
(d)), as amended; the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 and the Budget and Accounting Procedures
Act, as amended (see 31 U.S.C.) (reference (af)); and 10 U.S.C. 2328 (reference (ag)).

       C6.1.2. Application

                C6.1.2.1. The fees described in this Chapter apply to FOIA requests, and conform to the
Office of Management and Budget Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines
(reference (ah)). They reflect direct costs for search, review (in the case of commercial requesters); and
duplication of documents, collection of which is permitted by the FOIA. They are neither intended to
imply that fees must be charged in connection with providing information to the public in the routine
course of business, nor are they meant as a substitute for any other schedule of fees, such as DoD
7000.14-R (reference (ai)), which does not supersede the collection of fees under the FOIA. Nothing in
this Chapter shall supersede fees chargeable under a statute specifically providing for setting the level of
fees for particular types of records. A "statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for
particular types of records" (5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(4)(a)(vi)) (reference (a)) means any statute that enables a
Government Agency such as the Government Printing Office (GPO) or the National Technical
Information Service (NTIS), to set and collect fees. Components should ensure that when documents
that would be responsive to a request are maintained for distribution by agencies operating statutory-
based fee schedule programs such as the GPO or NTIS, they inform requesters of the steps necessary to
obtain records from those sources.

                C6.1.2.2. The term "direct costs" means those expenditures a Component actually makes
in searching for, reviewing (in the case of commercial requesters), and duplicating documents to respond
to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work
(the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits), and the costs of
operating duplicating machinery. These factors have been included in the fee rates prescribed at Section
C6.2. of this Chapter. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, heating
or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.

                C6.1.2.3. The term "search" includes all time spent looking, both manually and
electronically, for material that is responsive to a request. Search also includes a page-by-page or line-
by-line identification (if necessary) of material in the record to determine if it, or portions thereof are
responsive to the request. Components should ensure that searches are done in the most efficient and
least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both the Component and the requester. For example,
Components should not engage in line-by-line searches when duplicating an entire document known to
contain responsive information would prove to be the less expensive and quicker method of complying
with the request. Time spent reviewing documents in order to determine whether to apply one or more of
the statutory exemptions is not search time, but review time. See paragraph .5., below, for the definition
of review, and paragraphs C6.1.3.5.. and C6.2.2.2., below, for information pertaining to computer
searches.


                                                    67
                C6.1.2.4. The term "duplication" refers to the process of making a copy of a document in
response to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microfiche, audiovisual, or
machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disc), among others. Every effort will be made
to ensure that the copy provided is in a form that is reasonably usable, the requester shall be notified that
the copy provided is the best available and that the Agency's master copy shall be made available for
review upon appointment. For duplication of computer tapes and audiovisual, the actual cost, including
the operator's time, shall be charged. In practice, if a Component estimates that assessable duplication
charges are likely to exceed $25.00, it shall notify the requester of the estimate, unless the requester has
indicated in advance his or her willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice shall
offer a requester the opportunity to confer with Component personnel with the object of reformulating
the request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.

                C6.1.2.5. The term "review" refers to the process of examining documents located in
response to a FOIA request to determine whether one or more of the statutory exemptions permit
withholding. It also includes processing the documents for disclosure, such as excising them for release.
Review does not include the time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application
of exemptions. It should be noted that charges for commercial requesters may be assessed only for the
initial review. Components may not charge for reviews required at the administrative appeal level of an
exemption already applied. However, records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemption
that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of
other exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review would be properly
assessable.

       C6.1.3. Fee Restrictions

                C6.1.3.1. No fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine
collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the
exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two
hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge. For example, for a
request (other than one from a commercial requester) that involved two hours and ten minutes of search
time, and resulted in one hundred and five pages of documents, a 79 Component would determine the
cost of only ten minutes of search time, and only five pages of reproduction. If this processing cost was
equal to, or less than, the cost to the Component for billing the requester and processing the fee
collected, no charges would result.

                C6.1.3.2. Requesters receiving the first two hours of search and the first one hundred
pages of duplication without charge are entitled to such only once per request. Consequently, if a
Component, after completing its portion of a request, finds it necessary to refer the request to a
subordinate office, another DoD Component, or another Federal Agency to action their portion of the
request, the referring Component shall inform the recipient of the referral of the expended amount of
search time and duplication cost to date.

                C6.1.3.3. The elements to be considered in determining the "cost of collecting a fee" are
the administrative costs to the Component of receiving and recording a remittance, and processing the
fee for deposit in the Department of Treasury's special account. The cost to the Department of Treasury
to handle such remittance is negligible and shall not be considered in Components' determinations.

                C6.1.3.3. (AF) For FOIA purposes, Air Force activities will consider the cost of
collecting a fee to be $15 and will not assess requesters' fees for any amount less than $15.

                                                     68
               C6.1.3.4. For the purposes of these restrictions, the word "pages" refers to paper copies of
a standard size, which will normally be "8 1/2 x 11" or "11 x 14". Thus, requesters would not be entitled
to 100 microfiche or 100 computer disks, for example. A microfiche containing the equivalent of 100
pages or 100 pages of computer printout however, might meet the terms of the restriction.

                 C6.1.3.5. In the case of computer searches, the first two free hours will be determined
against the salary scale of the individual operating the computer for the purposes of the search. As an
example, when the direct costs of the computer central processing unit, input output devices, and
memory capacity equal $24.00 (two hours of equivalent search at the clerical level), amounts of
computer costs in excess of that amount are chargeable as computer search time. In the event the direct
operating cost of the hardware configuration cannot be determined, computer search shall be based on
the salary scale of the operator executing the computer search. See Section C6.2., this Chapter, for
further details regarding fees for computer searches.

       C6.1.4. Fee Waivers

                C6.1.4.1. Documents shall be furnished without charge, or at a charge reduced below fees
assessed to the categories of requesters in subsection C6.1.5. below, when the Component determines
that waiver or reduction of the fees is in the public interest because furnishing the information is likely
to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Department of
Defense and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

             C6.1.4.2. When assessable costs for a FOIA request total $15.00 or less, fees shall be
waived automatically for all requesters, regardless of category.

               C6.1.4.3. Decisions to waive or reduce fees that exceed the automatic waiver threshold
shall be made on a case-by-case basis, consistent with the following factors:

                           C6.1.4.3.1. Disclosure of the information "is in the public interest because it is
likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the
Government."

                                        C6.1.4.3.1.1. The subject of the request. Components should
analyze whether the subject matter of the request involves issues that will significantly contribute to the
public understanding of the operations or activities of the Department of Defense. Requests for records
in the possession of the Department of Defense which were originated by nongovernment organizations
and are sought for their intrinsic content, rather than informative value, will likely not contribute to
public understanding of the operations or activities of the Department of Defense. An example of such
records might be press clippings, magazine articles, or records forwarding a particular opinion or
concern from a member of the public regarding a DoD activity. Similarly, disclosures of records of
considerable age may or may not bear directly on the current activities of the Department of Defense;
however, the age of a particular record shall not be the sole criteria for denying relative significance
under this factor. It is possible to envisage an informative issue concerning the current activities of the
Department of Defense, based upon historical documentation. Requests of this nature must be closely
reviewed consistent with the requester's stated purpose for desiring the records and the potential for
public understanding of the operations and activities of the Department of Defense.

                                      C6.1.4.3.1.2. The informative value of the information to be
disclosed. This factor requires a close analysis of the substantive contents of a record, or portion of the
record, to determine whether disclosure is meaningful, and shall inform the public on the operations or
                                                      69
activities of the Department of Defense. While the subject of a request may contain information that
concerns operations or activities of the Department of Defense, it may not always hold great potential
for contributing to a meaningful understanding of these operations or activities. An example of such
would be a previously released record that has been heavily redacted, the balance of which may contain
only random words, fragmented sentences, or paragraph headings. A determination as to whether a
record in this situation will contribute to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the
Department of Defense must be approached with caution, and carefully weighed against the arguments
offered by the requester. Another example is information already known to be in the public domain.
Disclosure of duplicative, or nearly identical information already existing in the public domain may add
no meaningful new information concerning the operations and activities of the Department of Defense.

                                        C6.1.4.3.1.3. The contribution to an understanding of the subject by
the general public likely to result from disclosure. The key element in determining the applicability of
this factor is whether disclosure will inform, or have the potential to inform the public, rather than
simply the individual requester or small segment of interested persons. The identity of the requester is
essential in this situation in order to determine whether such requester has the capability and intention to
disseminate the information to the public. Mere assertions of plans to author a book, researching a
particular subject, doing doctoral dissertation work, or indigence are insufficient without demonstrating
the capacity to further disclose the information in a manner that will be informative to the general
public. Requesters should be asked to describe their qualifications, the nature of their research, the
purpose of the requested information, and their intended means of dissemination to the public.

                                      C6.1.4.3.1.4. The significance of the contribution to public
understanding. In applying this factor, Components must differentiate the relative significance or impact
of the disclosure against the current level of public knowledge, or understanding which exists before the
disclosure. In other words, will disclosure on a current subject of wide public interest be unique in
contributing previously unknown facts, thereby enhancing public knowledge, or will it basically
duplicate what is already known by the general public? A decision regarding significance requires
objective judgment, rather than subjective determination, and must be applied carefully to determine
whether disclosure will likely lead to a significant public understanding of the issue. Components shall
not make value judgments as to whether the information is important enough to be made public.

                           C6.1.4.3.2. Disclosure of the information "is not primarily in the commercial
interest of the requester."

                                       C6.1.4.3.2.1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest.
If the request is determined to be of a commercial interest, Components should address the magnitude of
that interest to determine if the requester's commercial interest is primary, as opposed to any secondary
personal or non-commercial interest. In addition to profitmaking organizations, individual persons or
other organizations may have a commercial interest in obtaining certain records. Where it is difficult to
determine whether the requester is of a commercial nature, Components may draw inference from the
requester's identity and circumstances of the request. In such situations, the provisions of subsection
C6.1.5. below, apply. Components are reminded that in order to apply the commercial standards of the
FOIA, the requester's commercial benefit must clearly override any personal or non-profit interest.

                                       C6.1.4.3.2.2. The primary interest in disclosure. Once a requester's
commercial interest has been determined, Components should then determine if the 82 disclosure would
be primarily in that interest. This requires a balancing test between the commercial interest of the
request against any public benefit to be derived as a result of that disclosure. Where the public interest is
                                                     70
served above and beyond that of the requester's commercial interest, a waiver or reduction of fees would
be appropriate. Conversely, even if a significant public interest exists, and the relative commercial
interest of the requester is determined to be greater than the public interest, then a waiver or reduction of
fees would be inappropriate. As examples, news media organizations have a commercial interest as
business organizations; however, their inherent role of disseminating news to the general public can
ordinarily be presumed to be of a primary interest. Therefore, any commercial interest becomes
secondary to the primary interest in serving the public. Similarly, scholars writing books or engaged in
other forms of academic research, may recognize a commercial benefit, either directly, or indirectly
(through the institution they represent); however, normally such pursuits are primarily undertaken for
educational purposes, and the application of a fee charge would be inappropriate. Conversely, data
brokers or others who merely compile government information for marketing can normally be presumed
to have an interest primarily of a commercial nature.

                 C6.1.4.4. Components are reminded that the factors and examples used in this subsection
are not all inclusive. Each fee decision must be considered on a case-by-case basis and upon the merits
of the information provided in each request. When the element of doubt as to whether to charge or waive
the fee cannot be clearly resolved, Components should rule in favor of the requester.

              C6.1.4.5. In addition, the following additional circumstances describe situations where
waiver or reduction of fees are most likely to be warranted:

                         C6.1.4.5.1. A record is voluntarily created to prevent an otherwise burdensome
effort to provide voluminous amounts of available records, including additional information not
requested.

                          C6.1.4.5.2. A previous denial of records is reversed in total, or in part, and the
assessable costs are not substantial (e.g., $15.00 - $30.00).

       C6.1.5. Fee Assessment

                C6.1.5.1. Fees may not be used to discourage requesters, and to this end, FOIA fees are
limited to standard charges for direct document search, review (in the case of commercial requesters)
and duplication.

              C6.1.5.2. In order to be as responsive as possible to FOIA requests while minimizing
unwarranted costs to the taxpayer, Components shall adhere to the following procedures:

                        C6.1.5.2.1. Analyze each request to determine the category of the requester. If
the Component determination regarding the category of the requester is different than that claimed by
the requester, the Component shall:

                                      C6.1.5.2.1.1. Notify the requester to provide additional justification
to warrant the category claimed, and that a search for responsive records will not be initiated until
agreement has been attained relative to the category of the requester. Absent further category
justification from the requester, and within a reasonable period of time (i.e., 30 calendar days), the
Component shall render a final category determination, and notify the requester of such determination,
to include normal administrative appeal rights of the determination.

                                     C6.1.5.2.1.2. Advise the requester that, notwithstanding any appeal,
a search for responsive records will not be initiated until the requester indicates a willingness to pay
                                                     71
assessable costs appropriate for the category determined by the Component. C6.1.5.2.2. Requesters
should submit a fee declaration appropriate for the below categories.

                          C6.1.5.2.2. Requesters should submit a fee declaration appropriate forthe below
categories.

                                     C6.1.5.2.2.1. Commercial. Requesters should indicate a willingness
to pay all search, review and duplication costs.

                                    C6.1.5.2.2.2. Educational or Noncommercial Scientific Institution
or News Media. Requesters should indicate a willingness to pay duplication charges in excess of 100
pages if more than 100 pages of records are desired.

                                    C6.1.5.2.2.3. All Others. Requesters should indicate a willingness to
pay assessable search and duplication costs if more than two hours of search effort or 100 pages of
records are desired.

                                  C6.1.5.2.2.3. (AMC) Categorize attorneys and law firms for fee
assessment purposes based on who they represent. Categorize them as "all others" when they
represent an individual and as a "commercial requester" when they represent a company.

                        C6.1.5.2.3. If the above conditions are not met, then the request need not be
processed and the requester shall be so informed.

                           C6.1.5.2.4. In the situations described by subparagraphs C6.1.5.2.1. and
C6.1.5.2.2., above, Components must be prepared to provide an estimate of assessable fees if desired by
the requester. While it is recognized that search situations will vary among Components, and that an
estimate is often difficult to obtain prior to an actual search, requesters who desire estimates are entitled
to such before committing to a willingness to pay. Should Components’ actual costs exceed the amount
of the estimate or the amount agreed to by the requester, the amount in excess of the estimate or the
requester's agreed amount shall not be charged without the requester's agreement.

                           C6.1.5.2.5. No DoD Component may require advance payment of any fee; i.e.,
payment before work is commenced or continued on a request, unless the requester has previously failed
to pay fees in a timely fashion, or the agency has determined that the fee will exceed $250.00. As used
in this sense, a timely fashion is 30 calendar days from the date of billing (the fees have been assessed in
writing) by the Component.

                          C6.1.5.2.6. Where a Component estimates or determines that allowable charges
that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250.00, the Component shall notify the
requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a
history of prompt payments, or require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated
charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment.

                           C6.1.5.2.7. Where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a
timely fashion (i.e., within 30 calendar days from the date of the billing), the Component may require
the requester to pay the full amount owed, plus any applicable interest, or demonstrate that he or she has
paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the
Component begins to process a new or pending request from the requester. Interest will be at the rate

                                                     72
prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 (reference (aj)), and confirmed with respective Finance and Accounting
Offices.

                        C6.1.5.2.7. (AMC) If a requester does not remit fees within 30 days after
receiving final response letter, notify the requester that failure to remit fees will result in being
placed on the bad-debt list for the command. Use sample letter at Appendix 23. Allow 30
additional calendar days. If fees are not remitted within that time, provide HQ AMC/A6OBR with
the name of the requester, the name of the firm/company they represent, the amount due and the
base FOIA number. Upon receipt of a request from an individual/company on the bad debt list,
use the letter at Appendix 24 to notify the requester of the amount due.

                           C6.1.5.2.8. After all work is completed on a request, and the documents are
ready for release, Components may request payment before forwarding the documents, particularly for
those requesters who have no payment history, or for those requesters who have failed previously to pay
a fee in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 calendar days from the date of the billing). In the case of the
latter, the previsions of subparagraph C6.1.5.2.7., above, apply.

                         C6.1.5.2.9. When Components act under subparagraphs C6.1.5.2.1. through
C6.1.5.2.7, above, the administrative time limits of the FOIA will begin only after the Component has
received a willingness to pay fees and satisfaction as to category determination, or fee payments (if
appropriate).

                           C6.1.5.2.10. Components may charge for time spent searching for records,
even if that search fails to locate records responsive to the request. Components may also charge search
and review (in the case of commercial requesters) time if records located are determined to be exempt
from disclosure. In practice, if the Component estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25.00,
it shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance
his or her willingness to pay fees as high as those 85 anticipated. Such a notice shall offer the requester
the opportunity to confer with Component personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet
his or her needs at a lower cost.

              C6.1.5.3. Commercial Requesters. Fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges
for document search, review and duplication when records are requested for commercial use. Requesters
must reasonably describe the records sought. (See subsection C1.5.8. above.)

                           C6.1.5.3.1. The term "commercial use" request refers to a request from, or on
behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit
interest of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a
requester properly belongs in this category, Components must determine the use to which a requester
will put the documents requested. Moreover, where a Component has reasonable cause to doubt the use
to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself,
Components should seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.

                          C6.1.5.3.2. When Components receive a request for documents for commercial
use, they should assess charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for
release, and duplicating the records sought. Commercial requesters (unlike other requesters) are not
entitled to two hours of free search time, nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. Moreover,
commercial requesters are not normally entitled to a waiver or reduction of fees based upon an assertion
that disclosure would be in the public interest. However, because use is the exclusive determining

                                                    73
criteria, it is possible to envision a commercial enterprise making a request that is not for commercial
use. It is also possible that a non-profit organization could make a request that is for commercial use.
Such situations must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.

                C6.1.5.4. Educational Institution Requesters. Fees shall be limited to only reasonable
standard charges for document duplication (excluding charges for the first 100 pages) when the request
is made by an educational institution whose purpose is scholarly research. Requesters must reasonably
describe the records sought (see subsection C1.5.8. above). The term "educational institution" refers to a
pre-school, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate high education,
an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an
institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. Fees
shall be waived or reduced in the public interest if the criteria of subsection C6.1.4., above, have been
met.

                C6.1.5.5. Non-Commercial Scientific Institution Requesters. Fees shall be limited to only
reasonable standard charges for document duplication (excluding charges for the first 100 pages) when
the request is made by a non-commercial scientific institution whose purpose is scientific research.
Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought (see subsection C1.5.8., above). The term "non-
commercial scientific institution" refers to an institution that is not operated on a "commercial" basis as
defined in subparagraph C6.1.5.3.., above, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting
scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
Fees shall be waived or reduced in the public interest if the criteria of subsection C6.1.4., above, have
been met.

                C6.1.5.6. Components shall provide documents to requesters in paragraphs C6.1.5.4. and
C6.1.5.5., above, for the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be
eligible for inclusion in these categories, requesters must show that the request is being made under the
auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for commercial use, but in
furtherance of scholarly (from an educational institution) or scientific (from a non-commercial scientific
institution) research.

               C6.1.5.7. Representatives of the news media. Fees shall be limited to only reasonable
standard charges for document duplication (excluding charges for the first 100 pages) when the request
is made by a representative of the news media. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought
(see subsection C1.5.8., above). Fees shall be waived or reduced if the criteria of subsection C6.1.4.,
above, have been met.

                           C6.1.5.7.1. The term "representative of the news media" refers to any person
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the
public. The term "news" means information that is about current events or that would be of current
interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting
to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as
disseminators of "news") who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general
public. These examples are not meant to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news
delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services),
such alternative media would be included in this category. In the case of "freelance" journalists, they
may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting
publication though that organization, even through not actually employed by it. A publication contract


                                                    74
would be the clearest proof, but Components may also look to the past publication record of a requester
in making this determination.

                           C6.1.5.7.2. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet
the criteria in subparagraph C6.1.5.7.1., above, and his or her request must not be made for commercial
use. A request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be
considered to be a request that is for a commercial use. For example, a document request by a newspaper
for records relating to the investigation of a defendant in a current criminal trial of public interest could
be presumed to be a request from an entity eligible for inclusion in this category, and entitled to records
at the cost of reproduction alone (excluding charges for the first 100 pages).

                           C6.1.5.7.3. "Representative of the news media" does not include private
libraries, private repositories of Government records, information vendors, data brokers or similar
marketers of information whether to industries and businesses, or other entities.

                C6.1.5.8. All Other Requesters. Components shall charge requesters who do not fit into
any of the categories described in subsections C6.1.5.3.., C6.1.5.4., C6.1.5.5., or C6.1.5.7., fees which
recover the full direct cost of searching for and duplicating records, except that the first two hours of
search time and the first 100 pages of duplication shall be furnished without charge. Requesters must
reasonably describe the records sought (see subsection C1.5.8., above). Requests from subjects about
themselves will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (reference
(d)), which permit fees only for duplication. Components are reminded that this category of requester
may also be eligible for a waiver or reduction of fees if disclosure of the information is in the public
interest as defined under subsection C6.1.4.1., above. (See also subparagraph C6.1.5.3.2.)

       C6.1.6. Aggregating Requests. Except for requests that are for a commercial use, a Component
may not charge for the first two hours of search time or for the first 100 pages of reproduction.
However, a requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a
document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When a Component reasonably
believes that a requester or, on rare occasions, a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to
break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding the assessment of fees, the
Agency may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. One element to be considered in
determining whether a belief would be reasonable is the time period in which the requests have
occurred. For example, it would be reasonable to presume that multiple requests of this type made
within a 30 day period had been made to avoid fees. For requests made over a longer period however,
such a presumption becomes harder to sustain and Components should have a solid basis for
determining that aggregation is warranted in such cases. Components are cautioned that before
aggregating requests from more than one requester, they must have a concrete basis on which to
conclude that the requesters are acting in concert and are acting specifically to avoid payment of fees. In
no case may Components aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester.

        C6.1.7 Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-365) (reference (ak)). The Debt
Collection Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-365) (reference (ak)) provides for a minimum annual rate of interest to
be charged on overdue debts owed the Federal Government. Components may levy this interest penalty
for any fees that remain outstanding 30 calendar days from the date of billing (the first demand notice)
to the requester of the amount owed. The interest rate shall be as prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 (reference
(aj)). Components should verify the current interest rate with respective Finance and Accounting
Offices. After one demand letter has been sent, and 30 calendar days have lapsed with no payment,


                                                     75
Components may submit the debt to respective Finance and Accounting Offices for collection pursuant
to reference (ak).

        C6.1.8. Computation of Fees. The fee schedule in this Chapter shall be used to compute the
search, review (in the case of commercial requesters) and duplication costs associated with processing a
given FOIA request. costs shall be computed on time actually spent. Neither timebased nor dollar-based
minimum charges for search, review and duplication are authorized. The appropriate fee category of the
requester shall be applied before computing fees.

       C6.1.9. Refunds. In the event that a Component discovers that it has overcharged a requester or
a requester has overpaid, the Component shall promptly refund the charge to the requester by
reimbursement methods that are agreeable to the requester and the Component.

C6.2. COLLECTION OF FEES AND FEE RATES

        C6.2.1. Collection of Fees. Collection of fees will be made at the time of providing the
documents to the requester or recipient when the requester specifically states that the costs involved
shall be acceptable or acceptable up to a specified limit that covers the anticipated costs. Collection of
fees may not be made in advance unless the requester has failed to pay previously assessed fees within
30 calendar days from the date of the billing by the DoD Component, or the Component has determined
that the fee will be in excess of $250 (see subsection C6.1.5., above).

       C6.2.2. Search Time.

               C6.2.2.1. Manual Search

                      Type            Grade                        Hourly Rate ($)

                      Clerical        E9/GS8 and below             12

                      Professional    O1-O6/GS9-GS15               25

                      Executive       O7/GS16/ES1 and above        45

               C6.2.2.2. Computer Search. Fee assessments for computer search consists of two parts;
individual time (hereafter referred to as human time), and machine time.

                          C6.2.2.2.1. Human time. Human time is all the time spent by humans
performing the necessary tasks to prepare the job for a machine to execute the run command. If
execution of a run requires monitoring by a human, that human time may be also assessed as computer
search. The terms “programmer/operator” shall not be limited to the traditional programmers or
operators. Rather, the terms shall be interpreted in their broadest sense to incorporate any human
involved in performing the computer job (e.g. technician, administrative support, operator, programmer,
database administrator, or action officer).

                         C6.2.2.2.2. Machine time. Machine time involves only direct costs of the
Central Processing Unit (CPU), input/output devices, and memory capacity used in the actual computer
configuration. Only this CPU rate shall be charged. No other machine related costs shall be charged. In
situations where the capability does not exist to calculate CPU time, no machine costs can be passed on
to the requester. When CPU calculations are not available, only human time costs shall be assessed to
                                                    76
requesters. Should DoD Components lease computers, the services charged by the lessor shall not be
passed to the requester under the FOIA.

       C6.2.3. Duplication

                       Type                        Cost per Page (cents)

                Pre-Printed                                  02
                material

                Office copy                                  15

                Microfiche                                   25

                Computer copies      Actual cost of duplicating the tape, disc or
                (tapes, discs or     printout (includes operator's time and cost of the
                printouts)           medium)

C6.2.4. Review Time (in the case of commercial requesters)

            Type                   Grade            Hourly Rate ($)

        Clerical       E9/GS8 and below                    12

        Professional   O1-O6/GS9-GS15                      25

        Executive      O7/GS16/ES1 and above               45

        C6.2.5. Audiovisual Documentary Materials. Search costs are computed as for any other record.
Duplication cost is the actual direct cost of reproducing the material, including the wage of the person
doing the work. Audiovisual materials provided to a requester need not be in reproducible format or
quality.

        C6.2.6. Other Records. Direct search and duplication cost for any record not described in this
section shall be computed in the manner described for audiovisual documentary material.

        C6.2.7. Costs for Special Services. Complying with requests for special services is at the
discretion of the Components. Neither the FOIA, nor its fee structure cover these kinds of services.
Therefore, Components may recover the costs of special services requested by the requester after
agreement has been obtained in writing from the requester to pay for one or more of the following
services:

               C6.2.7.1. Certifying that records are true copies.

               C6.2.7.2. Sending records by special methods such as express mail, etc.

C6.3. COLLECTION OF FEES AND FEE RATES FOR TECHNICAL DATA

       C6.3.1. Fees for Technical Data


                                                    77
                 C6.3.1.1. Technical data, other than technical data that discloses critical technology with
military or space application, if required to be released under the FOIA, shall be released after the
person requesting such technical data pays all reasonable costs attributed to search, duplication and
review of the records to be released. Technical data, as used in this section, means recorded information,
regardless of the form or method of the recording of a scientific or technical nature (including computer
software documentation). This term does not include computer software, or data incidental to contract
administration, such as financial and/or management information. DoD Components shall retain the
amounts received by such a release, and it shall be merged with and available for the same purpose and
the same time period as the appropriation from which the costs were incurred in complying with request.
All reasonable costs as used in this sense are the full costs to the Federal Government of rendering the
service, or fair market value of the service, whichever is higher. Fair market value shall be determined in
accordance with commercial rates in the local geographical area. In the absence of a known market
value, charges shall be based on recovery of full costs to the Federal Government. The full costs shall
include all direct and indirect costs to conduct the search and to duplicate the records responsive to the
request. This cost is to be differentiated from the direct costs allowable under section C6.2. of this
chapter for other types of information released under the FOIA.

               C6.3.1.2. Waiver. Components shall waive the payment of costs required in paragraph
C6.3.1.1., above, which are greater than the costs that would be required for release of this same
information under section C6.2. of this chapter if:

                          C6.3.1.2.1. The request is made by a citizen of the United States or a United
States corporation, and such citizen or corporation certifies that the technical data requested is required
to enable it to submit an offer, or determine whether it is capable of submitting an offer to provide the
product to which the technical data relates to the United States or a contractor with the United States.
However, Components may require the citizen or corporation to pay a deposit in an amount equal to not
more than the cost of complying with the request, which will be refunded upon submission of an offer
by the citizen or corporation;

                          C6.3.1.2.2. The release of technical data is requested in order to comply with
the terms of an international agreement; or,

                          C6.3.1.2.3. The Component determines in accordance with paragraph
C6.1.4.1., above, that such a waiver is in the interest of the United States.

               C6.3.1.3. Fee Rates

                         C6.3.1.3.1. Search Time

                             established at 1/2 hourly rates).

                                      C6.3.1.3.1.2. Computer search is based on the total cost of the
central processing unit, input-output devices, and memory capacity of the actual computer configuration.
The wage (based upon the scale in subparagraph C6.3.1.3.1.1., above) for the computer operator and/or
programmer determining how to conduct, and subsequently executing the search will be recorded as part
of the computer search. See paragraph C6.2.2.2., above, for further details regarding computer search.

C7.1. REPORTS CONTROL

       C7.1.1. General.

                C7.1.1.1. The Annual Freedom of Information Act Report is mandated by the statute and
reported on a fiscal year basis. Due to the magnitude of the requested statistics and the need to ensure
accuracy of reporting, DoD Components shall track this data as requests are processed. This will also
facilitate a quick and accurate compilation of statistics. DoD Components shall forward their report to
the Directorate for Freedom of Information and Security Review no later than November 30 following
the fiscal year’s close. It may be submitted electronically and via hard copy accompanied by a computer
diskette. In turn, DoD will produce a consolidated report for submission to the Attorney General, and
ensure that a copy of the DoD consolidated report is placed on the Internet for public access.

                C7.1.1.1. (AF) MAJCOM FOIA managers and AFLSA/JACL send a consolidated report
for the fiscal year on DD Form 2564, Annual Report Freedom of Information Act, to AFCIO/P by 30
October via regular mail, e-mail, or facsimile. AFLSA/JACL will prepare the appeals and litigation
costs sections of the report. AF-CIO/P will make the Air Force report available on the WWW.

                C7.1.1.2. Existing DoD standards and registered data elements are to be utilized to the
greatest extent possible in accordance with the provisions of DoD Manual 8320.1-M, “Data
Administration Procedures” (reference (al)).

                                     C7.1.2.5.1.1. Beginning and Ending Report Period: Midnight, 2400
hours, September 30 of the Preceding Year -OR- 0001 hours, October 1 is the beginning of the report
period. Midnight, 2400 hours, is the close of the reporting period.

                         C7.1.2.5.2. Median Age of Initial Requests Pending: Report the median age in
days (including holidays and weekends) of initial requests pending.

                         C7.1.2.5.3. Examples of Median Calculation.

                                      C7.1.2.5.3.1. If given five cases aged 10, 25, 35, 65, and 100 days
from date of receipt as of the previous September 30th, the total requests pending is five (5). The median
age (days) of open requests is the middle, not average value, in this set of numbers (10, 25, 35, 65, and
100), 35 (the middle value in the set).

                                       C7.1.2.5.3.2. If given six pending cases, aged 10, 20, 30, 50, 120,
and 200 days from date of receipt, as of the previous September 30th, the total requests pending is six
(6). The median age (days) of open requests 40 days (the mean [average] of the two middle numbers in
the set, in this case the average of middle values 30 and 50).

                         C7.1.2.5.4. Accuracy of Calculations. Components must ensure the accuracy of
calculations. As backup, the raw data used to perform calculations should be recorded and preserved.
This will enable recalculation of median [and mean values] as necessary. Components may require
subordinate elements to forward raw data, as deemed necessary and appropriate.

                          C7.1.2.5.5. Average. If a Component believes that “average” (mean)
processing time is a better measure of performance, then report “averages” (means) as well as median
values (e.g., with data reflected and plainly labeled on plain bond as an attachment to the report).
                                                    84
However, “average” (mean) values will not be included in the consolidated DoD report unless all
Components report it.

                            C7.1.2.5.5. (AF) Air Force will use the “median age” and will not collect or
report averages.

C8.1. RESPONSIBILITY AND PURPOSE

       C8.1.1. Responsibility. The Head of each DoD Component is responsible for the establishment
of educational and training programs on the provisions and requirements of this Regulation. The
educational programs should be targeted toward all members of the DoD Component, developing a
general understanding and appreciation of the DoD FOIA Program; whereas, the training programs
should be focused toward those personnel who are involved in the day-to-day processing of FOIA
requests, and should provide a thorough understanding of the procedures outlined in this Regulation.

        C8.1.2. Purpose. The purpose of the educational and training programs is to promote a positive
attitude among DoD personnel and raise the level of understanding and appreciation of the DoD FOIA
Program, thereby improving the interaction with members of the public and improving the public trust in
the DoD.

        C8.1.3. Scope and Principles. Each Component shall design its FOIA educational and training
programs to fit the particular requirements of personnel dependent upon their degree of involvement in
the implementation of this Regulation. The program should be designed to accomplish the following
objectives:

             C8.1.3.1. Familiarize personnel with the requirements of the FOIA and its
implementation by this Regulation.

               C8.1.3.2. Instruct personnel, who act in FOIA matters, concerning the provisions of this
Regulation, advising them of the legal hazards involved and the strict prohibition against arbitrary and
capricious withholding of information.

                C8.1.3.3. Provide for the procedural and legal guidance and instruction, as may be
required, in the discharge of the responsibilities of initial denial and appellate authorities.

               C8.1.3.4. Advise personnel of the penalties for noncompliance with the FOIA.

        C8.1.4. Implementation. To ensure uniformity of interpretation, all major educational and
training programs concerning the implementation of this Regulation should be coordinated with the
Director, Freedom of Information and Security Review.

         C8.1.5. Uniformity of Legal Interpretation. In accordance with DoD Directive 5400.7 (reference
(b)), the DoD Office of the General Counsel shall ensure uniformity in the legal position and
interpretation of the DoD FOIA Program.

AP1.1. General

        AP1.1.1. In accordance with DoD Directive 5400.7 (reference (b)) and this Regulation, the

5100.3 (reference (e)).

        AP1.1.2. The policy change in AP1.1.1., above, authorizes and requires the Combatant
Commands to process FOIA requests in accordance with reference (b) and DoD Instruction 5400.10

require special attention or guidance.

       AP1.2.4. Consult with other OSD and DoD Components that may have a significant interest in
the requested record prior to a final determination. Coordination with Agencies outside of the
Department of Defense, if required, is authorized.

       AP1.2.5. Coordinate proposed denials of records with the appropriate Combatant Command's
Office of the Staff Judge Advocate.

        AP1.2.6. Answer any request for a record within 20 working days of receipt. The requester shall
be notified that his request has been granted or denied. In unusual circumstances, such notification may
state that additional time, not to exceed 10 working days, is required to make a determination.

        AP1.2.7. Provide to the Director, Freedom of Information and Security Review when the request
for a record is denied in whole or in part, a copy of the response to the requester or the requester’s
representative, and any internal memoranda that provide background information or rationale for the
denial.

       AP1.2.8. State in the response that the decision to deny the release of the requested information,
in whole or in part, may be appealed to the Director, Administration and Management and Washington
Headquarters Services, Directorate for Freedom of Information and Security Review, Room 2C757,

                                                    89

Headquarters Services a copy of the records that were denied. The Director, Administration and
Management and Washington Headquarters Services shall make such requests when adjudicating

Freedom of Information and Security Review and the Freedom of Information Act Offices of the
Combatant Commands. This communication capability shall be used for FOIA cases that are time
sensitive.

AP1.5. Information Requirements

       AP1.5.1. The Combatant Commands shall submit to the Director, Freedom of Information and
Security Review, an annual report. The instructions for the report are outlined in Chapter 7, above.

       AP1.5.2. The annual reporting requirement contained in this regulation shall be submitted in
duplicate to the Director, Freedom of Information and Security Review not later than each November

   SAMPLES, AIR FORCE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT PROCESSING DOCUMENTS

AP7.1. GENERAL. This appendix includes suggested language in paragraph format that tracks Air
Force and DoD FOIA guidance. The rest of the body of letters and memorandums should comply with
Air Force administrative guidance. Each MAJCOM may elect to prepare their own verbiage to meet
their specific needs, so long as FOIA processing actions are consistent with guidance in DoD 5400.7-R
and this supplement. In this appendix, language in italics is for explanatory purposes only. DO NOT
include any of the italicized language of this appendix in your FOIA correspondence. When optional
language must be selected, the optional language will be presented within brackets. Use only the
portions that apply to the specific request or response.

AP7.2. INITIAL RECEIPT OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST.

         We received your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated ## Month year, for
(summarize the request) on ## Month year (date received). We will provide you our release
determination by (enter date that is 20 workdays from date you received the request). [Based on our
initial review, we believe we cannot process your request within 20 workdays.] (If “cannot” is used, add
appropriate explanation; examples follow.) Please contact (name and commercial telephone number) if
you have any questions and refer to case number#######.

AP7.3 INTERIM RESPONSE.

        Your request will be delayed because: all or part of the responsive records are not located at this
installation; (and/or) Processing this FOIA request will require us to collect and review a substantial
number of records (and/or) Other Air Force activities or other agencies (if applicable) to include the
submitter of the information, need to be involved in deciding whether or not to release the responsive
records. We expect to reply to your request not later than (give a date that is not more than 30 workdays
from the initial receipt of the request); (or) ( If processing the FOIA request will take more than the
allowed time limits to respond). We find we are unable to meet the time limits imposed by the FOIA in
this instance because (tell the requester the reason for the delay) (example: the records are classified
and must be reviewed for possible declassification by other activities or agencies). We anticipate
completing your request by (date).

        (When charging fees is appropriate), the FOIA provides for the collection of fees based on the
costs of processing a FOIA request and your fee category. Based on the information in your request, we
have determined your fee category is [commercial/educational or noncommercial scientific institution or
news media/all others]. As a result, you (if commercial category) are required to pay all document
search, review and duplication costs over $15.00. (or) As a result, you (if educational or noncommercial
scientific institution or news media ) will be provided the first one hundred (100) pages free of charge;
you are required to pay any duplication costs over and above those amounts. (or) As a result, you (if all
others) will be provided the first two (2) hours of search time and the first one hundred (100) pages free
of charge; you are required to pay any search and duplication costs over and above those amounts.

AP7.4. REQUEST FOR A MORE SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION.

       Your request does not sufficiently describe the desired records. The FOIA applies to existing Air
Force records; without more specific information from you, we cannot identify what documents might
be responsive to your request. Please give us whatever additional details you may have on the Air Force
                                                  109
records you want. Can you tell us when the records were created, and what Air Force element may have
created the records? If this request involves an Air Force contract, do you know the contract number and
dates it covered? Our address is (include name and complete mailing address), our fax number is (give
fax number) our e-mail address is (optional - give complete e-mail address). Based on the original
request you sent us, we are unable to respond.

AP7.5. SINGLE LETTER ACKNOWLEDGING RECEIPT OF REQUEST AND GIVING FINAL
RESPONSE (If you can complete a FOIA request within the statutory 20-workday processing period,
Air Force elements may elect to send a single letter to the requester, along with responsive records
which are released to the requester in full).

       We received your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated ## Month year, for
(summarize the request) on ## Month year (date received). A copy (or) Copies of (describe the
record(s) being released) [is/are] releasable and [is/are] attached.

AP7.6. COLLECTION OF FEES.

        The FOIA provides for the collection of fees based on the costs of processing a FOIA request
and your fee category. We have placed you in the (enter the fee category) fee category. In your case, we
have assessed a charge of $_____ for processing your request. The fee was calculated in the following
manner: (Give a detailed cost breakdown: for example, 15 pages of reproduction at $0.15 per page; 5
minutes of computer search time at $43.50 per minute, 2 hours of professional level search at $25 per
hour.) Please make your check payable to (appropriate payee) and send it to (give your completemailing
address) by (date 30 days after the letter is signed). (or) The FOIA provides for the collection of fees
based on the costs of processing a FOIA request and your fee category. We have placed you in the (enter
the fee category); however, in this case, we have waived collecting fees.

AP7.7. MULTITRACK PROCESSING LETTERS TO FOIA REQUESTERS (When using the
multitrack FOIA processing system, determine which of the following paragraphs to include in your
letters to the requester. To the extent it may apply, include language from paragraph 2 of the sample. If
a requester asks for expedited processing, answer carefully if you decide not to provide expedited
processing, because requesters may appeal denial of their request for expedited processing. Advise
requesters placed into the complex track in writing how they can simplify their request to qualify for the
simple track.)

        We received your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated ## Month year, for
(summarize the request) on ## Month year (date received). Because our organization has a significant
number of pending FOIA requests, which prevents us from making a response determination within 20
workdays, we have instituted multitrack processing of requests. Based on the information you provided,
we have placed your request in the [simple or complex] track. We have assigned number ##### to
identify your request; should you need to contact us about your request, please write or call (name and
telephone) and use this number to assist us in responding more promptly.

       Based on our current backlog, we expect to respond to your request not later than (give an
estimated date). Our policy is to process requests within their respective tracks in the order in which we
receive them. We do process each FOIA request as quickly as we can.

AP7.8. IF THE REQUEST IS PLACED IN THE COMPLEX TRACK.


                                                   110
        In your case, processing your request is complex because (give basic reasons this is a complex
case: request was vague or complicated; the records sought are voluminous; multiple organizations will
have to work on this request; records are classified; responsive records came from another
command/another service/a nongovernment source; responsive records were part of the Air Force's
decision-making process, and the prerelease review will require policy determinations from different Air
Force elements; records describe law enforcement activities; records involve foreign policy issues; due
to the nature of your request and/or the nature of our computer system, responding to your request or
providing a response in the electronic format you requested will be technically complex, etc.).
Simplifying your request might permit quicker processing in the following ways: (describe ways the
search could be narrowed to fewer records, or ways policy issues could be avoided, etc.) Can you tell us
when the records were created, and what Air Force element may have created the records? If this request
involves an Air Force contract, do you know the contract number? Please give us whatever additional
details you may have on the Air Force records you are seeking, so we can attempt to streamline the
processing of your request. Our address is (give complete mailing address), our fax number is (give fax
number) our e-mail address is (optional - give complete e-mail address).

AP7.9. IF THE REQUESTER ASKS THAT YOU EXPEDITE THEIR REQUEST:

        Because individuals receiving expedited processing may receive a response before other earlier
requesters, there are administrative requirements you must meet before we can expedite a request. In
your request, you asked that we expedite processing. In order for us to expedite a request, the requester
must provide a statement certifying the reasons supporting their request are true and correct to the best
of their knowledge.

        There are four categories of requests eligible for expedited processing. We can expedite your
request if you demonstrate you need the information because (1) failure to obtain the records on an
expedited basis could pose an imminent threat to life or physical safety of an individual; or (2) the
information is urgently needed by an individual primarily engaged in disseminating information in order
to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity; or (3) failure to obtain the
records on an expedited basis could lead to an imminent loss of substantial due process rights, or (4)
release would serve a humanitarian need by promoting the welfare and interests of mankind.

         In the second category, "urgently needed" means the information itself has a particular value that
it will lose if it is not disseminated quickly. Ordinarily this means the information concerns a breaking
news story of general public interest. Historic information, or information sought for litigation or
commercial activities usually would not qualify for expedited processing in the second category. Also,
the fact that a news organization has an internal broadcast or publication deadline, so long as the
deadline was unrelated to the nature of the information itself (for example, the information was not a
breaking news story of general public interest) would not make the information "urgently needed."

        In this case, we have determined your FOIA request [will /will not] receive expedited processing.
We came to this conclusion because you [did /did not] demonstrate you need the information because
failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis [could or could not] reasonably expect to pose an
imminent threat to life or physical safety of an individual (or) the information [is or is not] urgently
needed in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity (or) failure to
obtain the records on an expedited basis [could or could not] reasonably expect to lead to an imminent
loss of substantial due process rights, (or) release [would or would not] serve a humanitarian need by
promoting the welfare and interests of mankind (and/or) your request for expedited processing did not
meet the statutory requirements of the FOIA; you did not provide enough information to make a
                                                   111
determination of compelling need for the information you requested (and/or) you did not properly
certify your request.

AP7.10. IF YOU DENY A REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:

        If you consider our decision not to expedite your request incorrect, you may appeal our decision.
Include in your appeal letter the reasons for reconsidering your request for expedited processing, and
attach a copy of this letter. Address your appeal to: Secretary of the Air Force through (address of
MAJCOM FOIA office).

         In the meantime, we will continue to process your request in the [simple/complex] processing
track.

AP7.11. CERTIFICATION, COMPUTER SYSTEMS MANAGER (ELECTRONIC RECORDS OR
FORMAT REQUESTED) (When answering a request for electronic records, based on theconfiguration
of your hardware and/or software, certain factors may make a particular request complex. Have your
computer system manager advise you whether or not they can create the new record/format on a
"business as usual" basis. If producing the record/format would entail a significant expenditure of
resources in time and manpower that would cause significant interference with the operation of the
information system and adversely affect mission accomplishment, you do not need to process the
request. The FOIA office needs to get a certification from the computer systems manager to document
this determination to support their response. Possible language for this certification is provided below.)

        I, (rank/grade and name) am the computer systems manager for (organization with electronic
records responsive to FOIA request). In consultation with (FOIA office), I have considered the FOIA
request of (requester's name), our ##### (FOIA identifier), which asked for (describe electronic record
or format). We [do/do not] have electronic records that are responsive to this request (or) data that we
[can/cannot] configure into the requested format. (If there are electronic records) The existing electronic
records [do/do not] contain nonreleasable data that we [can/cannot] remove from the electronic record.
Because of the way our [computer system/database/software] (use all that apply, specify hardware
and/or software nomenclature if possible; for example, IBM ###, Microsoft Excel) is configured,
creating the electronic record (or) modifying the existing record/format would entail a significant
expenditure of resources in time and manpower that would cause significant interference with the
operation of the information system and adversely affect mission accomplishment (describe how
responding would interfere and time/manpower resources required, give estimated reprogramming time,
if possible). I have applied the DoD 5400.7-R paragraph C1.5.7.2. "standard of reasonableness" in
considering this request. I understand that when the capability exists to respond to a FOIA request that
would require only a "business as usual" approach to electronically extract the data and compile an
electronic record or reformat data to satisfy a FOIA request, then creation of the electronic record or
reformatting the data would be appropriate. In this case, a significant expenditure of resources and
manpower would be required to compile the electronic record (or) reformat existing data. This activity
would cause a significant interference with the operation of our automated information system. I certify
creation of the electronic record (or) reformatting existing data in order to respond to this request would
not be reasonable, under the circumstances.

        (Note: Some electronic data requests may include a request for software. You may have to
release government-developed software that is not otherwise exempt, if requested under the FOIA.
Exemptions 1 -classified software, 2 -testing, evaluation, or similar software, 3-exempt by statute, 5-
deliberative process/privileged software, and 7 -law enforcement operations software may apply, based
on the nature of the requested software. If the software is commercial off-the-shelf software, as opposed
to software developed by the government, the software may qualify to be withheld from release under
FOIA exemption 4. See paragraph C3.2.1.4.7 which would permit withholding of: "Computer software
copyrighted under the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. 106) (reference (t)), the disclosure of which
would have an adverse impact on the potential market value of a copyrighted work."

AP7.12. "NO (PAPER OR ELECTRONIC) RECORDS" OR "REQUESTED FORMAT NOT
AVAILABLE" LETTERS

      This is in response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated ## Month year, for
(summarize the request) on ## Month year (date received), our number #####.

       A thorough search by (identify the unit(s) that tried to locate responsive records) did not locate
any records responsive to your request. (If the requester asked questions, and there are no responsive
records that would provide the answers to those questions): The FOIA applies to existing Air Force
records; the Air Force need not create a record in order to respond to a request.

                                                   (OR)

         A thorough assessment by the OPR and the computer systems manager has determined we
cannot provide the [electronic record data] in the format you requested. (If this can be done on a
"business as usual basis):" [Paper copies American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
files] of the data you requested are attached.

        If you interpret this "no records" response as an adverse action, you may appeal it in writing to
the Secretary of the Air Force. Your appeal should be postmarked no later than 60 calendar days from
the date of this letter. Address your letter as follows:

               Secretary of the Air Force
               Thru: (MAJCOM FOIA Office)
               (mailing address)

        The FOIA provides for the collection of fees based on the costs of processing a FOIA request
and your fee category. We have placed you in the (enter category) fee category; however, in this case,
we have waived fees. (If paper copies or ASCII files are provided: ) The FOIA provides for the
collection of fees based on the costs of processing a FOIA request and your fee category. In your case,
as a requester in the fee category of (add appropriate category), we have assessed a charge of $_____
for processing your request. The fee was calculated in the following manner: (Give a detailed cost
breakdown: for example, 15 pages of reproduction at $0.15 per page; 5 minutes of computer search
time at $43.50 per minute, 2 hours of professional level search at $25 per hour.) Please make your
check payable to (appropriate payee) and send it to (give your complete mailing address) by (date 30
days after the letter is signed).

AP7.13. REFERRAL OR COORDINATION LETTERS. (These letters are to tell the requester all or
part of the request was referred to another Air Force organization, to refer or coordinate the request to
                                                    113
another federal government organization, and to advise a nongovernment submitter a FOIA request was
received for information they submitted.)

       AP7.13.1 Letter to Requester.

        (If all or part of a request has been referred, write to the requester:) Your Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA) request dated ## Month year, for (summarize the request) received on ## Month year (date
received), our number #####, was referred (or) must be coordinated with (give mailing address of the
FOIA office to which you are referring all or part of the request, the identity of the federal government
organization you are either coordinating with or are referring all or part of the request to, or that you
must coordinate with the nongovernment submitter of responsive information). (On referrals:) That
office will process [all/part] of your request (describe which part is being referred if the entire request is
not being referred) and they will respond directly to you. (On coordinations:) That organization has a
significant interest in the records (or) created the records that may answer to your request. (Before
notifying a requester of a referral to another DoD component or federal agency, consult with them to
determine if their association with the material is exempt. If so, protect the association and any exempt
information without revealing the identity of the protected activity.) (When a nongovernment submitter
is involved:) The nongovernment submitter of information that may answer your request needs time to
respond to the possible release of information under the FOIA.

        Because we must refer (or) coordinate your request outside our organization, your request will
be delayed. We will determine whether any records are available; as soon as is practicable, a decision
will be made whether to release or to withhold from disclosure any responsive records under the FOIA,
Title 5 U.S.C. Section 552. Your request will be processed as expeditiously as circumstances permit.

       AP7.13.1. (AMC) When notifying requesters that you contacted nongovernment sources
for their views on releasing information, indicate that the nongovernment source has 30 days to
respond. Use sample letter at Appendix 25.

       AP7.13.2. Letter To Another Government Agency.

        (If all or part of a request was referred or requires coordination, write to the government entity):
On ## Month year (date received), our organization received a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request from (identity of requester), attachment 1, dated ## Month year, for (summarize the request).
Based on our assessment of that request, our number #####, we need to [refer/coordinate] [all/part] of
that request to you (describe which part is being referred or coordinated, if it was not the entire
request). (Name and phone number of person who agreed to the referral or coordination) accepted this
referral (or) coordination action was on (date). We notified the requester of this action (see Attachment
2).

       We [do/do not] hold records responsive to this request. (If do hold is used:) Copies of responsive
records located in our files are included at Attachment 3 to assist you in making your assessment on the
releasability of [our/your] related records. If you need to contact us, our phone number and address is
(give name, phone and complete mailing address), our fax number is (give fax number) our e-mail
address is (give complete e-mail address).

       AP7.13.3. Letter To Submitter of Contract-Related Information.

        (If contractor-submitted information is involved, write to the submitter:) On ## Month year
(date received), our organization received a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from (identity
                                                   114
of requester), our number #####, dated ## Month year, for (summarize the request). Information you
submitted to the Air Force was identified as responsive to this request, see copies at Attachment 1.

        To determine the releasability of the information contained in these documents and to give you
the maximum protection under the law, please review the attached documents and give us the
information outlined in Attachment 2 (Appendix 11). If you feel the information is privileged or

statutory requirements for withholding the information from release under FOIA exemption 4, Title 5
U.S.C. 552(b)(4), respond to us in writing not later than ## working days from the date of this letter
(usually 30 calendar days.) If you object to release of this information under the FOIA, identify the
items, lines, columns or portions you believe we should withhold from release.

        You will also need to provide a written explanation of how release would adversely impact or
cause harm to your competitive position, your commercial standing, or other legally protected interests.
An assertion that "we should deny because all of the information was submitted in confidence" or "deny
because all of the information was marked as proprietary in nature" would not justify withholding of the
requested information under the FOIA. If you need to contact us, call or write (give name), phone
number is (give commercial number), our address is (give complete mailing address), our fax number is
(give fax number) our e-mail address is (give complete e-mail address).

       AP7.13.4. Letter Requesting State Department Coordination.

        (If the State Department is involved in coordinating on a request, fax or e-mail 11 CS/SCSR so
they can inform SAF/IA if appropriate). On ## Month year (date received), our organization received a
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from (identity of requester), our number #####, dated ##
Month year, for (summarize the request). Because of the nature of this request, we were advised by (note
the individual and organization who told you to coordinate the request with the State Department; this
may be a MAJCOM or Combatant Command—give telephone and facsimile numbers if known) we need
to coordinate this request with the Department of State. In accordance with DoD 5400.7-R, Air Force
Supplement, paragraph C5.2.8.4, we are informing you of their involvement in this FOIA request.
{Provide any specifics available.} Air Force records are involved in this action. If you need to contact
us, our phone number is (give commercial and DSN numbers), our address is (give complete mailing
address), our fax number is (give fax number) our e-mail address is (give complete e-mail address).

AP7.14. CERTIFICATION OF INITIAL CLASSIFICATION OR DECLASSIFICATION
AUTHORITY (When denying a FOIA request, in whole or in part, because the information requested is
classified, the initial classification authority, his or her successor, or a declassification authority, needs
to determine if the records are "properly and currently classified," and therefore must be withheld from
release under FOIA exemption (b)(1); also, you need to determine that you cannot release any
reasonably segregable additional portions. Language that certifies such a determination was made on a
FOIA request involving classified records follows).

       AP7.14.1. Sample Certification Format - All Information Remains Classified.

         I, (rank/grade and name) am the initial classification authority (or) the successor to the original
initial classification authority (or) the declassification authority for (give an unclassified description of
the records concerned). In consultation with (FOIA office), I have assessed the FOIA request of
(requester's name), our ##### (FOIA identifier), for records that were properly classified at the time of
their creation and currently remain properly classified in accordance with Executive Order 12958 (or)

                                                     115
contain information that we have determined is classified in accordance with Executive Order 12958
Section 1.5 (_) (OR) in accordance with Executive Order 12958 Section1.5(_) and is also exempt from
declassification in accordance with Section 1.6(_) of the Executive Order (OR IF THE RECORD IS
MORE THAN 25 YEARS OLD ) contain information that we have determined is exempt from
declassification in accordance with Executive Order 12958 Section 3.4(b)(_). Unauthorized release
could cause (for TOP SECRET, use exceptionally grave; for SECRET use serious; for CONFIDENTIAL
do not add language; should read cause damage) damage to national security. There are no reasonably
segregable portions that we can release. Consequently release of this information is denied pursuant to 5
U.S.C. Section 552(b)(1).

               Signature

               (Date Signed)                                                 (Signature Block)

       AP7.14.2. Sample Certification Format - Portions Remain Classified.

         I, (rank/grade and name) am the initial classification authority (OR) the successor to the original
initial classification authority (OR) the declassification authority for (give an unclassified description of
the records concerned.) In consultation with (FOIA office), I have assessed the FOIA request of
(requester's name), our ##### (FOIA identifier), that asked for records, (OR) portions of which were
properly classified at the time of their creation. Portions of the records currently remain properly
classified in accordance with Executive Order 12958. The bracketed information is currently and
properly classified in accordance with Section 1.5 (add appropriate subparagraph), Executive Order
12958, and is also exempt from declassification in accordance with Section 1.6(_) of the Executive
Order (OR IF THE RECORD IS MORE THAN 25 YEARS OLD) contain information that we have
determined is exempt from declassification in accordance with Executive Order 12958 Section 3.4(b)(_).
Unauthorized release could cause (for TOP SECRET use exceptionally grave; for SECRET use serious;
for CONFIDENTIAL do not add language; should read cause damage) damage to national security.
There are no other reasonably segregable portions that we can release. Consequently this information is
denied pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Section 552(b)(1).

               Signature

               (Date Signed)                                                 (Signature Block)

AP7.15. LETTER TO A REQUESTER WHO HAS WITHDRAWN THEIR REQUEST OR APPEAL
(If a FOIA requester has withdrawn a FOIA request or appeal, sending a final letter to the requester to
close the file may be wise. Suggested language to the requester follows).

                We received your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request (OR) appeal dated ##
Month year, on ## Month year (date received). After sending us your request (OR) appeal, you indicated
by (facsimile, letter) that you wished to withdraw your request (OR) appeal. We have, therefore, closed
your file without further action.

AP7.16. LETTER TO A REQUESTER WHO HAS APPEALED AFTER THE 60-DAY DEADLINE
(We will not process FOIA appeals received after the 60-day time limit, unless the requester provides
adequate justification for failing to comply. If you receive a late appeal, and it gives inadequate
justification for failing to comply, the FOIA office will advise the requester their appeal was closed;
suggested language for a letter to an untimely requester follows.)

                                                    116
                 We received your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) appeal dated ## Month year, on
## Month year (date received). You did not appeal within 60 days of the postmarked date of our denial
letter as outlined in our agency regulation. Therefore, we are closing our file.

AP7.17. LETTER TO A REQUESTER WHO HAS APPEALED (There are occasions when, on
reconsideration, an IDA grants all or part of an appeal. When sending their appeal to higher
headquarters, notify the requester. Suggested language to a requester who has appealed follows).

      We received your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) appeal, our number #####, dated ##
Month year, on ## Month year (date received). We considered the issues raised in your appeal carefully.

       We have decided to grant (OR) partially grant your appeal.

       (If you grant all or part of the appeal): Upon reconsideration, we are releasing the requested
records (OR) granting your request. (If the appeal is only partially granted, describe what portions
remain in dispute). (If applicable): We are releasing and attaching all or portions of the responsive
records. (If applicable): We will continue processing your appeal for the remaining withheld [records/
information].

     ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSING OF AIR FORCE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
                                 REQUESTS

AP9.1. General. This appendix is a checklist format of processing steps and explanations of Air Force
and DoD guidance. Each MAJCOM may elect to prepare its own checklists to tailor FOIA processing
actions within its own organizations to meet their specific needs, so long as it remains consistent with
guidance contained in DoD 5400.7-R and this supplement.

AP9.2. Procedures: Freedom of Information Act Requests

        AP9.2.1. Note the date the request was received, give the request a unique identifier/number, and
log the request.

       AP9.2.2. Assess the request to determine initial processing requirements:

               AP9.2.2.1. Determine what Air Force elements may hold responsive records.

                          AP9.2.2.1.1. Are responsive records kept at the same or different installations?

                          AP9.2.2.1.2. Is referral of (all/part) of the request required?

         AP9.2.3. Determine appropriate processing track (simple/complex/expedited). (Air Force FOIA
offices without backlogs do not multitrack FOIA requests.) Note: Requesters have a right to appeal an
adverse tracking decision (for example, when it is determined their request will not be expedited.) Also,
if their request qualifies for the complex track, tell requesters so they may limit the scope of their request
in order to qualify for the simple track. FOIA managers must assess a request before placing it into a
specific processing track, and must support their actions should the requester appeal. If a request is
determined to be complex, or is not expedited when the requester sought expedited processing, you must
advise the requester of the adverse tracking decision in writing. See Appendix 7 for sample language for
this kind of letter to a requester.

                 AP9.2.3.1. Simple - defines a request that can be processed quickly, with limited impact
on the responding units. The request clearly identifies the records, involves no (or few) complicating
factors (e.g., there are few or no responsive records, involves only one installation and there are no
outside OPRs, involves no classified records [Exemption 1], a law exempts the responsive records from
disclosure [Exemption 3], no contractor-submitted records [Exemption 4], no deliberative
process/privileged materials [Exemption 5], records contain no [or limited] personal privacy
information/did not come from Privacy Act systems of records concerning other individuals [Exemption
6], release of records would have minimal impact on law enforcement [Exemption 7]; no time
extensions expected, other than the additional 10-workdays allowed in situations outlined in the FOIA).
If the requested data must come from electronic records, response can be completed on a "business-as
sual" basis; requires no (or limited) reprogramming of automated information systems and would cause
no significant interference with operation of information systems by processing a simple
request/providing a response in the electronic format requested.

               AP9.2.3.2. Complex - defines a request whose processing will take substantial time, will
cause significant impact on responding units. Complications and delays are likely (e.g., the request is
vague (poor description of records, unclear who or when records were created), records are massive in
                                                     120
volume, multiple organizations will receive tasking, records are classified [Exemption 1], records came
from another command/service/a nongovernment source [Exemption 4], records are part of the Air
Force's decision-making process, and not incorporated into a final decision [IG/audit reports, legal
opinions, misconduct or mishap investigations etc.] or are attorney-client records [Exemption 5], records
are largely personal information on another individual or came from Privacy Act systems of records
[Exemption 6], records describe law enforcement activities or information from [and/or identities of]
confidential sources [Exemption 7]; response cannot be completed on a "business as usual" basis and
would require extensive reprogramming or cause significant interference with operation of the
automated information systems. (Advise requester, in writing, of right to limit the scope of their request
in order to qualify for simple track.)

                AP9.2.3.3. An expedited request is when a requester asks for expedited processing and
explains the compelling need (imminent threat to life or physical safety; urgently needed by a person
primarily engaged in disseminating information; due process; or humanitarian need) for the requested
information. In order to receive expedited processing, requesters must provide a statement certifying
their "demonstration" (description) of their specific "compelling need" or due process/humanitarian need
is true and correct to the best of their knowledge. When a requester seeks expedited processing, FOIA
offices must respond in writing to the requester within 10 calendar days after receipt of the request
approving or denying their request for expedited processing. Requesters have a right to appeal an
adverse decision (e.g., when it is determined their requests will not be expedited). There are four
categories of FOIA requests that qualify for expedited processing:

                          AP9.2.3.3.1. The requester asserts a "compelling need" for the records, because
a failure to obtain records quickly could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or
physical safety of an individual.

                            AP9.2.3.3.2. The requester asserts a "compelling need" for the records, because
the information is “urgently needed” by an individual engaged in disseminating information to inform
the public (primarily news media requesters; and could also include other persons with the ability to
disseminate information) Note: “Urgently needed,” in this case, means the information has a particular
value that will be lost if it is not disseminated quickly. This normally would apply to a breaking news
story of general public interest. Information of historical interest only, or sought for litigation or
commercial activities would not qualify, nor would the fact a news media entity had an internal
broadcast deadline of its own, which was unrelated to the "news breaking nature" of the information
itself, cause the requested information to qualify as “urgently needed.”

                           AP9.2.3.3.3. Failure to obtain records quickly could cause imminent loss of
substantial due process rights OR providing the information quickly would serve a "humanitarian need"
(i.e., disclosing the information will promote the welfare and interests of mankind). While FOIA
requests falling into these third and fourth categories can qualify for expedited processing, process them
in the expedited track behind the requests qualifying for expedited processing based on "compelling
need" (the first two types of expedited FOIA requests).

        AP9.2.4. Determine fee category of requester (Commercial/Educational—Noncommercial
Scientific Institution—News Media/All Others) and assess fee issues. When all assessable costs are
$15.00 or less, waive fees automatically for all categories of requesters. Assess other fee waiver or
reduction requests on a case-by-case basis. See Chapter 6.



                                                   121
       AP9.2.5. Apply fee waiver/fee reduction criteria in appropriate cases (when requester asks for
fee waiver/reduction). See Chapter 6, paragraph C6.1.4.

       AP9.2.6. Find the Responsive Air Force Records (if any).

              AP9.2.6.1. Send the request to the appropriate OPRs to search for responsive records and
to decide whether to recommend release of any responsive records. Include a DD Form 2086, or a DD
Form 2086-1, in each request. The OPR must complete and return the appropriate forms and statements
to the FOIA office.

                AP9.2.6.2. If the OPRs find no responsive records, or if the OPRs desire to withhold any
responsive records from release to the requester, the OPRs must provide a written certificate detailing
either their unsuccessful search, or their reasons why the documents should be withheld from release
under the FOIA; the written OPR statements must accompany the copies of the records the OPR desires
to withhold as the FOIA action is processed (e.g., include it in any denial or appeal file). NOTE: If any
part of a FOIA request is denied, and the requester appeals that denial, include all forms, certificates and
documents prepared by the OPRs in the FOIA appeal package in Tab 5 (see paragraph AP9.5).

AP9.3. Contacts with Freedom of Information Act Requesters and Non-Air Force Submitters of Data

       AP9.3.1. Contacts with Air Force Elements. A FOIA request is considered "received" (and
therefore ready to process) when the FOIA office responsible for processing the request physically
receives it, when the requester states a willingness to pay fees set for the appropriate fee category, or, if
applicable, when the requester has paid any past FOIA debts and has reasonably described the requested
records. Keep hard/paper copies of all memoranda documenting requester contacts with Air Force
elements regarding a pending FOIA request in the requester's FOIA file. If the requester contacts Air
Force elements telephonically about a pending FOIA request, the Air Force member participating in the
conversation must prepare notes or memorandums for record (MFR), and keep those notes or MFRs in
the requester's FOIA file. If any part of a FOIA request is denied, and the requester appeals that denial,
submit documentation of requester contacts with Air Force elements in chronological order in the FOIA
appeal package in Tab 1 (see paragraph AP9.5).

         AP9.3.2. Contacts with the FOIA Requester. See Appendix 7 for samples of language to use in
various types of Air Force FOIA letters. If any part of a FOIA request is denied, and the requester
appeals that denial, submit documents sent by Air Force elements to the requester (except for the denial
letter, which will be in Tab 3) in the FOIA appeal package in Tab 5 in chronological order (see
paragraph AP9.5). Letters that Air Force FOIA offices may need to send to a FOIA requester include:

                AP9.3.2.1. An initial notification letter that the FOIA request was received.

                        AP9.3.2.1.1. This letter may advise the requester that processing of the FOIA
request may be delayed because:

                                     AP9.3.2.1.1.1. All or part of the requested records are not located at
the installation processing the FOIA request (see paragraph AP9.3.2.2).

                                      AP9.3.2.1.1.2. An enormous number of records must be collected
and reviewed.


                                                    122
                                     AP9.3.2.1.1.3. Other Air Force activities or other agencies, to
include (if applicable) the nongovernment submitter of information, need to be involved in deciding
whether or not to release the records.

                                    AP9.3.2.1.1.4. If you cannot complete processing of a FOIA request
within 20 workdays, advise the requester of the reasons for the delay and give a date (within 30
workdays after receiving the request) when the requester can expect a final decision.

               AP9.3.2.2. The initial notification letter may advise the requester all/part of the request
was referred to another Air Force element or government activity.

               AP9.3.2.3. The initial notification letter may advise the requester of the appropriate fee
category. In cases where fees are appropriate, and requesters have not agreed to pay for responsive
records and fees are likely to be more than $15.00, seek assurances that the requester agrees to pay
appropriate fees. If more information is needed to make a fee category determination, or to determine
whether fees should be waived/reduced, inform the requester. FOIA offices may determine fee
waiver/reduction requests before processing a FOIA request; if a fee waiver/reduction request is denied,
the requester may appeal that denial; he/she may also appeal an adverse fee category determination (e.g.,
asked for news media fees, but was assessed commercial fees.)

                AP9.3.2.4. The initial notification letter may advise the requester the request does not
sufficiently describe the desired records. If possible, help the requester identify the requested records by
explaining what kind of information would make searching for responsive records easier.

              AP9.3.2.5. If Air Force elements can complete a FOIA request within the statutory 20-
workday processing period, you may elect to send only a single letter to the requester, along with
responsive records that are released to the requester in full.

               AP9.3.2.6. A letter to the requester that the responding FOIA office uses multitrack
processing due to a significant number of pending requests that prevents a response determination from
being made within 20 workdays. This letter advises the FOIA requester that track the request is in
(simple/complex); in this letter, if expedited processing was requested, the requester is advised if the
request will be expedited or not. If the request is found to be complex, you must advise the requester
he/she may alter the FOIA request to simplify processing. If it is determined the request will not be
expedited, the requester must be told he/she can appeal. (This may be the initial letter to the requester,
for Air Force elements with multitrack processing; if that is the case, this letter may include sections
discussed in paragraph AP9.3.2.1.)

                AP9.3.2.7. Subsequent letters to the requester on various subjects (for example, releasing
requested records; advising reasons for delays; responding to the letters, facsimiles or calls; advising the
requester of referrals to other Air Force units or government activities; involves a non-Air Force
submitter, etc.).

                AP9.3.2.8. A release letter to the requester, forwarding releasable responsive records with
a bill (if appropriate).

                AP9.3.2.9. A "no records" response letter to the requester if there are no responsive
records, or, a denial letter, if any responsive records are withheld from release. FOIA managers may sign
"no records" or "requested format not available" responses; they may also sign a letter that advises a
requester the fee category sought was not determined to be appropriate, or that a fee waiver/fee
                                                      123
reduction request was disapproved, or that a request for expedited processing has been denied. An IDA
must sign any letter or document withholding responsive records. When denying records, you must tell
the requester, in writing: the name and title or position of the official who made the denial
determination, the basis for the denial in enough detail to permit the requester to make a decision
concerning appeal, and the FOIA exemptions on which the denial is based. The denial letter must
include a brief statement describing what the exemptions cover. When the initial denial is based (in
whole or in part) on a security classification, this explanation should include a summary of the
applicable executive order criteria for classification, as well as an explanation of how those criteria
apply to the particular record in question. Estimate the volume of the records denied and provide this
estimate to the requester, unless providing such an estimate would harm an interest protected by an
exemption of the FOIA. This estimate should be in number of pages or, for records in other media, in
some other reasonable form of estimation, unless the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on
records disclosed in part. Indicate the size and location of the redactions on the records released. You
must also tell the requester how he/she can appeal the denial.

        AP9.3.3. Contacts with Non-Air Force Submitters of Data. Before releasing data (information or
records) submitted from outside the Air Force, determine whether you need to write to the submitter of
the data for their views on releasability of their data. In many cases, this non-Air Force data may fall
under FOIA Exemption 4. If it appears you must contact the submitter of the data, advise the requester
in writing that you must give the submitter of the data the opportunity to comment before the Air Force
decides whether to release the information. Give the submitter a reasonable period of time (30 calendar
days) to object to release and provide justification for withholding the documents. If the submitter does
not respond, advise the submitter in writing that you have not received a reply and plan to release the
records. Provide the submitter with the reasons the Air Force will release the records, and give the
submitter your expected release date (at least 2 weeks from the date of your letter). This permits the
submitter time to seek a temporary restraining order (TRO) in federal court, if they can convince the
judge to issue such an order. See Appendix 7 for samples of language to use in Air Force letters to both
the FOIA requester and nongovernment submitters. Remember to include a copy of Appendix 11 as an
attachment to the letter sent to the nongovernment submitter.

               AP9.3.3.1. The notice requirements of this section need not be followed if the Air Force
determines that the information should not be disclosed, the information has been lawfully published or
officially made available to the public, or disclosure of the information is required by law.

                 AP9.3.3.2. If the submitter objects to release of the records, but the Air Force disclosure
authority considers the records releasable, tell the submitter before releasing the data. Include in the
letter to the submitter a brief explanation and a specific release date at least 2 weeks from the date of the
letter. Advise the submitter once a determination is made that release of the data is required under the
FOIA, failure to oppose the proposed release will lead to release of submitted data. Also advise the
requester such a release under the FOIA will result in the released information entering the public
domain, and that subsequent requests for the same information will be answered without any formal
coordination between the Air Force and the submitter, unless the information is later amended, changed,
or modified. A person equal to, or higher in rank than, the denial authority makes the final decision to
disclose responsive records over the submitter's objection.

              AP9.3.3.3. When a previously released contract document has been modified, any
contract documents not in existence at the time of an earlier FOIA request that are responsive to a later
FOIA request for the same contract, will be processed as a first-time FOIA request for those newly
created documents. Notify the nongovernment submitter of the pending FOIA action, and give them the
                                                    124
same opportunity to respond as is detailed above. Passage of a significant period of time since the prior
FOIA release can also require Air Force elements to comply with the notice requirements in this
paragraph.

AP9.4. Denying All or Part of a Request. When responsive records are withheld from release (denied),
the appropriate offices must prepare a denial package for the IDA. Air Force elements must send the
request, related documents, and responsive records through their IDA’s FOIA office to the IDA for a
decision. The denial package must include:

       AP9.4.1. The FOIA request and any modifications by the requester.

       AP9.4.2. A copy of the responsive records, including both records that may be released and
records recommended for denial.

       AP9.4.3. Written recommendations from the OPRs and an Air Force attorney.

       AP9.4.4. The exemptions cited and a discussion of how the records qualify for withholding
under the FOIA.

                AP9.4.4.1. This discussion should also include the reasons for denial: to deny release of
responsive records requested under the FOIA, you must determine that disclosure of the records would
result in a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by a FOIA exemption (or exemptions), that the
record is exempt from release under one or more of the exemptions of the FOIA, and that a discretionary
release is not appropriate.

       AP9.4.5. Any collateral documents that relate to the requested records. For example:

               AP9.4.5.1. If the requested records came from a non-Air Force or non-U.S. Federal
Government submitter, include any documents from the submitter that relate to the release or denial of
the requested records. If you are not sure whether or not the non-Air Force or non-U.S. Federal
Government submitted information is potentially exempt from release under the FOIA, contact an Air
Force attorney. FOIA Exemptions 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 may apply.

               AP9.4.5.2. If the requested records came from Privacy Act systems of records, include a
written discussion of any Privacy Act issues.

               AP9.4.5.3. If any requested records came from another Air Force element, or release of
the requested records would affect another Air Force element, FOIA offices should coordinate with that
other element. If the FOIA request is not completely referred to the other element, include documents
from that element.

                AP9.4.5.4. If any requested records are classified, include a written certification from a
classification authority or declassification authority stating the data was properly classified originally,
that it remains properly classified (per Executive Order 12958), and, if applicable, that no reasonably
segregable portions can be released (see paragraph C3.2.1.1).

AP9.5. Freedom of Information Act Appeal Actions

        AP9.5.1. If an IDA, or a FOIA office responding on behalf of an IDA, withholds a record from
release because they determine the record is exempt under one or more of the exemptions to the FOIA,
                                                     125
the requester may appeal that decision, in writing, to the Secretary of the Air Force. The appeal should
be accompanied by a copy of the denial letter. FOIA appeals should be postmarked within 60 calendar
days after the date of the denial letter, and should contain the reasons the requester disagrees with the
initial denial. Late appeals may be rejected, either by the element initially processing the FOIA appeal,
or by subsequent denial authorities, if the requester does not provide adequate justification for the delay..
Appeal procedures also apply to the denial of a fee category claim by a requester, denial of a request for
waiver or reduction of fees, disputes regarding fee estimates, review on an expedited basis of a
determination not to grant expedited access to agency records, and for "no record" or "requested format
not available" determinations when the requester considers such responses adverse in nature.

        AP9.5.2. Coordinate appeals with an Air Force attorney (and the OPR, if appropriate) so they
can consider factual and legal arguments raised in the appeal, and can prepare written assessments of
issues raised in the appeal to assist the IDA in considering the appeal. MAJCOM FOIA offices and 11
CS/SCSR (for OPRs at HQ USAF and SAF), send all appeals to the Secretary of the Air Force through
AFLSA/JACL for consideration, unless the IDA has reconsidered the initial denial action, and granted
the appeal.

         AP9.5.3. If a requester appeals a "no records" determination, organizations must search again or
verify the adequacy of their first search (for example, if a second search would be fruitless, the
organization may include a signed statement from either the records OPR or the MAJCOM FOIA
manager detailing why another search was not practical). The appeal package must include documents
(to include a certification from the records OPR) that show how the organization tried to find responsive
records. In the event a requester sues the Air Force to contest a determination that no responsive records
exist, formal affidavits will be required to support the adequacy of any searches conducted.

         AP9.5.4. General Administrative Matters. FOIA requesters may ultimately sue the Air Force in
federal court if they are dissatisfied with adverse determinations. In these suits, the contents of the
administrative appeal file are evaluated to determine whether the Air Force complied with the FOIA and
its own guidance. Improper or inadequate appeal files make defending these cases problematic. Include
all the documents related to the requester's FOIA action in the appeal file. If appeal file documents are
sensitive, or are classified up to the SECRET level, send them separately to AFLSA/JACL, 1501 Wilson
Boulevard, 7th Floor, Arlington VA 22209-2403. Make separate arrangements with AFLSA/JACL for
processing classified appeal file documents TOP SECRET or higher. Cover letters on appeal packages
need to list all attachments. If a FOIA action is complicated, a chronology of events helps reviewers
understand what happened in the course of the request and appeal. If an appeal file does not include
documentation described below, include the tab, and insert a page marked "not applicable," "N/A," or
"not used." DO NOT just renumber the tabs and move the other items up. If any part of the requester's
appeal is denied, the appeal package must include a signed statement by the IDA, demonstrating the
IDA considered and rejected the requester's arguments, and the basis for that decision. This may be a
separate memorandum, an endorsement on a legal opinion or OPR opinion, or the cover letter which
forwards the appeal for final determination. Include in the cover letter forwarding the appeal to the
Secretary of the Air Force the name, phone number and e-mail address (if any) of the person to contact
about the appeal. The order and contents of appeal file attachments follow.

               AP9.5.4.1. The original appeal letter and envelope.

             AP9.5.4.2. The initial FOIA request, any modifications of the request by the requester or
any other communications from the requester, in chronological order.


                                                    126
               AP9.5.4.3. The denial letter.

                 AP9.5.4.4. Copies of all records already released. (An index of released documents may
be helpful, if there are a number of items. If the records released are “massive” [which means "several
cubic feet"] and AFLSA/JACL agrees, an index or description of the records may be provided in place
of the released records. Do not send appeal files without copies of released records without the express
agreement of AFLSA/JACL. Usually AFLSA/JACL requires all the released records in appeal files. If
you do not send the released records to AFLSA/JACL when a FOIA requester has appealed a partial
denial, retain a copy of what was released for 6 years.)

                 AP9.5.4.5. Copies of all administrative processing documents, including extension
letters, search descriptions, and initial OPR recommendations about the request, in chronological order.

                AP9.5.4.6. Copies of the denied records or portions marked to show what was withheld.
If your organization uses a single set of highlighted records (to show items redacted from records
released to the requester), ensure the records are legible and insert a page in either Tab 4 or Tab 6 stating
all records are contained in the other tab. (An index of denied documents may be helpful, if there are a
number of items. If the records denied are “massive” [which means "several cubic feet"] and
AFLSA/JACL agrees, an index or description of the records may be provided in place of the denied
records. Do not send appeal files without copies of denied records without the express agreement of
AFLSA/JACL. Usually AFLSA/JACL requires all the denied records in appeal files. If you do not send
the denied records to AFLSA/JACL, when a FOIA requester has appealed a denial, retain a copy of
what was denied for 6 years.)

                AP9.5.4.7. Place all legal opinions, in chronological order, in this tab. Include a pointby-
point discussion of factual and legal arguments in the requester's appeal (prepared by an Air Force
attorney and/or the OPR). If the IDA does not state in the cover letter he/she signed, that he/she
considered and rejected the requester's arguments, asserting the basis for that decision (e.g., the IDA
concurs in the legal and/or OPR assessments of the requester's arguments) include a signed, written
statement containing the same information from the IDA in this tab, either as a separate document or an
endorsement to a legal or OPR assessment. Include any explanation of the decision-making process for
intra-agency documents denied under the deliberative process privilege and how the denied material fits
into that process (if applicable).

           FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT EXEMPT INFORMATION EXAMPLES

AP10.1. General. Certain responsive records may contain parts that are releasable, along with other parts
that the Air Force must withhold from release. Carefully delete information exempt from release under
the FOIA from copies of otherwise releasable records. Do not release copies that would permit the
requester to “read through the marking.” In order to assist FOIA managers in redacting records, selected
items appropriate to withhold in commonly requested Air Force records are illustrated below.
(Italicizing denotes exempt information.)

AP10.2. Exemption 1. Example used is an extract from a “simulated” contingency plan (all information
below is fictional and UNCLASSIFIED; markings are used for illustrative purposes only).

     AP10.2.1. (U) Air Force members will safeguard all FELLOW YELLOW data (NOTE:
FELLOW YELLOW simulates an UNCLASSIFIED code name).

        AP10.2.2. (S) During the contingency deployment in Shambala, those members assigned to force
element FELLOW YELLOW will cover their movements by employing specified camouflage and
concealment activities while behind enemy lines. Only secure communications of limited duration as
specified in the communications annex will be employed until FELLOW YELLOW personnel return to
base. (Exemption 1)

AP10.3. Exemption 2. Example used is an extract from a “simulated” test administration guide (all
information below is fictional; information and marking is used for illustrative purposes only).

        When administering the test to determine which technicians are ranked fully qualified, make sure
to allow only the time specified in HQ AETC Pamphlet XYZ, which the technicians were permitted to
review as part of their test preparation. For ease in scoring this exam, correct answers are A, A, B, B, A,
B, C, C, A, B, D, D, C, C, C, D; the corresponding template for marking the standard answer sheet is
kept locked up at all times when not in use to grade answer sheets. (Exemption “high” 2)

AP10.4. Exemption 5. Example used is a simulated IG Report of Investigation (ROI) recommendation
(all information below is fictional; information and marking is used for illustrative purposes only):

        Having interviewed the appropriate personnel and having reviewed the appropriate documents, I
recommend additional training sessions for all branch personnel on accepted Air Force standards, and
the Air Force pursue administrative or judicial disciplinary action with respect to Terry Hardcase.
(Exemption 5)

AP10.5. Exemption 6. Example used is a simulated personnel computer report on a military member
selected for a special assignment [all information below is fictional; information and marking is used for
illustrative purposes only.]:

          Home Phone: (112) 223-3344
          [Exemption 6]



AP10.6. Exemption 7. Example used is summary of a law enforcement report on a domestic disturbance
at on-base family housing (all information below is fictional; information and marking is used for
illustrative purposes only):

        At 2140, the law enforcement desk, extension 222-3456, took an anonymous call that reported a
disturbance at 1234 Basestreet, quarters allegedly occupied by two military members. SrA Patrolman
{names of law enforcement investigators usually are withheld under Exemptions 6 and 7(C)} arrived on
the scene at 2155. SrA Patrolman met Nora Neighbor, {names of witnesses usually are withheld under
Exemptions 6 and 7(C)} who was very agitated. Because she feared her neighbors would retaliate
against her if they knew she reported their fight, she asked that her name not be released before she
would talk. After she was promised her identity would remain anonymous, she stated: {Nora Neighbor
became a confidential informant; data that could identify her, and in some cases, the information she
related, should be withheld from release under Exemptions 6, 7(C) and (D).} “I heard cursing and heard
furniture and dishes breaking. They fight all the time. I’ve seen Betty Battle {unless Betty is the
requester, redact her name Exemptions 6 and 7(C)} with a black eye, and I also saw Bob Battle {unless
Bob is the requester, redact his name Exemptions 6 and 7(C)} with bruises the day after they had their
last fight, last Saturday night. This time, there was a tremendous crash; I heard a man scream “My Lord
NO!” then I saw Betty Battle come out of the house with dark stains on her clothes—she got into her car
and drove away. I could see this really well, because the streetlight is right between our houses; I’m the
wife of their NCOIC. If only Nick, my husband, was here now, he’d know what to do! I haven’t heard
anything from Bob Battle.” (Exemptions 6 and 7)

                                  (ADDED)(AF) AP11. APPENDIX 11

 REQUIREMENTS OF TITLE 5 UNITED STATES CODE SECTION 552(b)(4) TO SUBMITTERS
          OF NONGOVERNMENT CONTRACT-RELATED INFORMATION

AP11.1. General. The FOIA requires federal agencies to provide their records, except those specifically
exempted, for the public to inspect and copy. Section (b) of the Act lists nine exemptions that are the
only basis for withholding records from the public.

         AP11.1.1. In this case, the fourth exemption, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), may apply to records or
information the Air Force maintains. Under this exemption, agencies must withhold trade secrets and
commercial or financial information they obtained from a person or organization outside the government
that is privileged or confidential. This generally includes information provided and received during the
contracting process with the understanding that the Air Force will keep it privileged or confidential.

       AP11.1.2. Commercial or financial matter is “confidential” and exempt if its release will
probably:

               AP11.1.2.1. Impair the government’s ability to obtain necessary information in the future.

               AP11.1.2.2. Substantially harm the source’s competitive position or impair some other
legitimate government interest such as compliance and program effectiveness.

AP11.2. Applicability of Exemption. The exemption may be used to protect information provided by a
nongovernment submitter when public disclosure will probably cause substantial harm to its competitive
position. Examples of information that may qualify for this exemption include:

        AP11.2.1. Commercial or financial information received in confidence with loans, bids,
contracts, or proposals, as well as other information received in confidence or privileged, such as trade
secrets, inventions, discoveries, or other proprietary data. (Note: Certain proprietary and source
selection information may also fall under exemption (b)(3), under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2305(g) or
41 USC 423, if statutory requirements are met.)

       AP11.2.2. Statistical data and commercial or financial information concerning contract
performance, income, profits, losses, and expenditures, offered and received in confidence from a
contractor or potential contractor.

        AP11.2.3. Personal statements given during inspections, investigations, or audits, received and
kept in confidence because they reveal trade secrets or commercial or financial information, normally
considered confidential or privileged.

        AP11.2.4. Financial data that private employers give in confidence for local wage surveys used
to set and adjust pay schedules for the prevailing wage rate of DoD employees.

       AP11.2.5. Information about scientific and manufacturing processes or developments that is
technical or scientific or other information submitted with a research grant application, or with a report
while research is in progress.

      AP11.2.6. Technical or scientific data a contractor or subcontractor develops entirely at private
expense, and technical or scientific data developed partly with Federal funds and partly with private
                                                    130
funds, in which the contractor or subcontractor retains legitimate proprietary interests per Title 10
U.S.C. 2320-2321 and Title 48 CFR.

        AP11.2.7. Computer software copyrighted under the Copyright Act of 1976 (Title 17 U.S.C.
106), the disclosure of which would adversely impact its potential market value.

AP11.3. Submitter’s Written Response. If release of the requested material would prejudice your
commercial interests, give detailed written reasons that identify the specific information and the
competitive harm public release will cause to you, your organization, or your business. The act requires
the Air Force to provide any reasonably segregable part of a record after deleting exempt portions. If
deleting key words or phrases would adequately protect your interests, advise us in writing which
portions you believe we can safely release, and which portions you believe we need to withhold from
release. If you do not provide details on the probability of substantial harm to your competitive position
or other commercial interests, which would be caused by releasing your material to the requester, we
may be required to release the information. Records qualify for protection on a case by case basis.

AP11.4. Pricing Information. Generally, the prices a contractor charges the government for goods or
services would be released under the FOIA. Examples of releasable data include (a) bids submitted in
response to an invitation for bids (IFB), (b) amounts actually paid by the government under a contract,
and (c) line item prices, contract award price, and modifications to a contract. Unit prices contained in a
contract award are considered releasable as part of the post award notification procedure prescribed by
the Title 48 CFR unless are part of an unsuccessful proposal, then 10 USC 2305(g) protects everything
including unit price.

SUBJECT: Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request (Number)(Suspense: Date)

1. We are sending you the attached FOIA request for action per DOD 5400.7/AF SUP.
Please reply by close of business on (7 workdays). If you:

a. RECOMMEND RELEASE. Include a copy of the requested record(s).

 b. RECOMMEND DENIAL OR PARTIAL DENIAL. Provide written rationale, citing the
specific exemption(s) from DOD 5400.7, paragraph C3.2.1.1 through C3.2.1.9. When
recommending denial, include a complete copy (no originals) of the record to be denied.
When recommending partial denial, include a copy of the record with portions
recommended for denial highlighted in yellow (IG/SP Reports and EOT Case Files--

 c. DO NOT POSSESS THE REQUESTED RECORDS. Explain why, i.e., destroyed
because they have met their retention period (cite table and rule from AFMAN 37-139), at
another location (where), etc.

 d. CANNOT IDENTIFY THE REQUESTED RECORDS. Indicate and explain what
specific information the requester should provide in order for you to identify the requested
records.

 e. DISCLOSURE AUTHORITY IS ANOTHER AGENCY. If you have a copy of the
records but they originated at another command/agency, furnish a copy of the record to
send to the disclosure authority.

 f. CONTRACT RELATED RECORDS. If the request is for a contract or contract related
record which contains data submitted by commercial sources, these sources must be
contacted to secure their views on the releasability of their information. The office who
contacts the source(s), as agreed to by the Records Management and Contracting
personnel, should use the sample in AMC Supplement 1 to DOD 5400.7/AFSUP.

 g. CLASSIFIED RECORDS. Conduct declassification review IAW E.O. 12598, Part 3.
Make a line-by-line review of the responsive record to determine if classification is proper
and current. Coordinate any declassification actions with Security Forces. Provide a copy
of the record to be released. Yellow highlight all areas which are to be withheld. If you
cannot declassify records, please provide guidance on where to refer the request for action.


                                                138
If you are the release authority and the records are properly classified, so advise.

2. Replies must indicate the concurrence of the JA Office. Coordination is sufficient on
recommendations for release. Recommendations for denial/partial denial require a written
legal review.

3. Please complete the DD Form 2086, Record of Freedom of Information (FOI) Processing
Cost, and return it and all attachments with your reply. Handcarry your reply to enable us
to meet the required suspense. Direct questions to (name of POC) at (complete office phone

Dear Mr. or Ms.
This letter is in response to your (date) Freedom of Information Act request for (requested
records). You asked for a waiver of fees incurred in processing your request.
Your request for a fee waiver does not contain sufficient justification to show how the
information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public. Before we can
authorize public subsidy of your efforts, we need more information on how you intend to
utilize the records to meaningfully and effectively inform the general public. Your
justification should specifically address:
The informative value of the records.
The public benefit to be gained.
The method to be employed in digesting, analyzing, and disseminating the information.
The estimated cost and nature of any charge to members of the public as well as the size of
the public sector to benefit; significance of the benefits; and likelihood of direct tangible
public good to be realized.
We require this information to determine if it is appropriate for United States taxpayers to
pay all or part of the associated costs.
In the event your fee waiver is denied, please indicate your agreement to pay the fee
associated with processing your request. We estimate the fees will be (amount). We will
categorize you as (Commercial/Educational/News Media/Other) and fees will be assessed
for (search at how many minutes, review and excise at how many minutes, and copies at 15
cents a page).
We will hold the processing of your request in abeyance pending receipt of justification for
fee waiver. Direct questions to (name of POC) at (area code/commercial phone number) or
fax us at (area code/commercial phone number).
                                               Sincerely,

Dear Mr. or Ms.
This letter is in response to your (date of request) Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request in which you asked for a waiver of fees for processing your request for (requested
records). We must deny your request for a fee waiver.
DOD 5400.7, Freedom of Information Act Program Regulation, authorizes waiver of FOIA
fees when providing the responsive information “is likely to contribute significantly to
public understanding of the operations or activities of the Department of Defense (DOD) is
not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” Determining if a requester
qualifies for a fee waiver “in the public interest” requires an evaluation of several factors.
Those factors include the subject of the request, the informative value of disclosure, the
significance disclosure will have on public understanding of DOD operations or activities,
and the requester’s commercial interest in disclosure.
We carefully considered your waiver request in light of applicable rules for waiving proces-
sing fees. We determined that disclosure of the requested record(s) is not likely to contri-
bute significantly to public understanding of DOD operations or activities. Disclosure will
most likely benefit only a small segment of the public. We note that you did not articulate
your or your group’s qualifications in researching, disseminating the information, or plans
for making the information public. You simply indicate you will disseminate the informa-
tion. Courts have previously addressed general assertions of this type and they do not sup-
port waiver of fees in these instances. In any case, it is not clear whether the records will be
used primarily to make a profit (as opposed to use for a personal or noncommercial pur-
pose). Under such circumstances, we cannot waive processing fees for your request.
We will categorize you and place you in the “All Other” category for processing your FOIA
request. This entitles you to the first 2 hours of search time and the first 100 pages repro-
duced free of charge.
To appeal our denial of your fee waiver request, address your letter to the Secretary of the
Air Force at the above address within 60 days from the date of this letter. Include your
reasons for reconsideration and attach a copy of this letter.
We will hold your request in abeyance pending receipt of your willingness to pay fees as
outlined above. Our point of contact is (Name) (phone number).
                                                Sincerely,

Dear Mr. or Ms.
This letter is in response to your (date of request) Freedom of Information Act request in
which you asked to review and make copies of (list records).
Before providing you access to any documents you requested, we must review them for
releasability. Part of our review includes contacting the offices, organizations, and/or
nongovernment sources that created the requested documents and asking them for their
views on disclosure. If any source objects to disclosure of documents or information they
provided the government, we must consult our legal staff and forward the entire case file to
our denial authority for a final decision about release.
Consequently, we cannot allow you to review and photocopy the requested records at this
time. Once we receive the sources’ inputs and (if necessary) a decision from our denial
authority, we can allow you to review the releasable portions of the records. The review
process should take approximately (estimate no. of days) but may take less or more time.
We will contact you when the process is complete to arrange a time for you to review the
records.
Prior to reviewing the documents that respond to your request, we must confirm that you
will pay reasonable processing fees. We asked the office of primary responsibility to
provide an estimate for processing your request. Estimated fees are:
Search Time (how much time) at (how many dollars)
Review/Excise (how much time) at (how many dollars)
Reproduction (how many pages) at (15 cents per page)
We will suspend processing of your request until we receive notification that you agree to
pay the fees associated with processing your request. Direct any questions to (name of
POC) at (area code/commercial phone number) or fax us at (area code/commercial phone
number).
                                              Sincerely,

Dear Mr. or Ms.
We received a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for a copy of (list what is being
requested). To comply with Executive Order 12600, we are required to notify nongovern-
ment sources of requests for records containing trade secrets and commercial or financial
information and afford them a reasonable time to object to disclosure.
If you want the Air Force to assert the (b)(4) “Confidential Business Information” exemp-
tion from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), on your behalf, our
legal staff has informed us that we need specifics from you (and your subcontractors, if
applicable) before we can adequately assert this exemption.
Specifically, past FOIA court cases have shown that it is vital you do more than simply
state that release of the requested information would cause you competitive harm. You
need to show how and why the particular information requested would cause you (or your
subcontractors, if applicable) competitive harm if released under the FOIA.
In order to afford you (or your subcontractors, if applicable) the fullest protection you are
entitled to under Exemption 4, we need you (and your subcontractors, if applicable) to
describe with particularity what information contained within the document would harm
you competitively if released and specifically, how release of such data would harm you.
Submit inputs from your subcontractors with your response, if applicable.
Our file on this case should contain your detailed response to this question because the
FOIA requester has the right to appeal a decision to withhold this information from them.
If our decision to withhold under Exemption 4 is not clearly warranted by the information
you provide us, the Secretary of the Air Force may decide that the FOIA requires them to
release the information. Even if the appeal is denied, the requester may still bring a lawsuit
to require release. A judge will look only to what is in our file on this request that justifies
withholding the information. As long as adequate and specific reasons are contained in the
file, a judge will normally uphold the Air Force’s decision not to release.
If your legal department is not involved in this issue, we suggest you notify them and ask
them to assist you in drafting a detailed response for our file. Please take the actions
described above and get back to us by (20 days). Direct any questions to (name of POC) at
(area code/commercial phone number) or fax us at (area code/commercial phone number).

Dear Mr. or Ms.

 We responded to your (date) Freedom of Information Act request for (indicate the records

        IC 2002-1 to DoDR 5400.7, DOD FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT PROGRAM

24 JUNE 2002 SUMMARY OF REVISIONS This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2002-1
(Attachment 1). It moves responsibility for the Air Force FOIA Program from HQ USAF/SC to AF-
CIO; updates Government Information Locator Service (GILS) links; changes the number of FOIA
requests to be considered frequently requested from 5 to 3, and updates organizational addresses, and
office symbols. C1.2.1. (AF) This supplement implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 37-1, Air
Force Information Management (will convert to AFPD 33-3), and applies to all Air Force activities. It
provides policies and procedures for implementing Title 5 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 552,
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as amended, and For Official Use Only (FOUO) information
requirements. In the case of a conflict, this supplement takes precedence over any Air Force publication
that addresses disclosure of Air Force records to the public. Commands may not change the basic
procedures in this supplement. Send copies of major command (MAJCOM), field operating agency
(FOA), and direct reporting unit (DRU) supplements to AF-CIO/P, 1155 Air Force Pentagon,
Washington DC 20330-1155. Use of the term “MAJCOM” throughout this supplement includes
MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs. Refer recommended changes or comments to Headquarters Air Force
Communications Agency (HQ AFCA/ITPP), 203 W. Losey Street, Room 1100, Scott AFB IL 62225-
5222, through appropriate channels, using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication,
with an information copy to AF-CIO/P.

C1.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) Summary of Revisions. This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2002-1
(Attachment 1). It moves responsibility for the Air Force FOIA Program from HQ USAF/SC to AFCIO;
updates Government Information Locator Service (GILS) links; changes the number of FOIA requests
to be considered frequently requested from 5 to 3, and updates organizational addresses, and office
symbols. A star ( ) indicates revision from the previous edition.

C1.3.1.3. (AF) AF-CIO/P will make the Air Force handbook and guide for requesting records available
on the World Wide Web (WWW) from Air ForceLINK, at http://www.foia.af.mil/handbook1.shtml.

C1.4.4.1. (Added)(AF) Government Information Locator Service (GILS). GILS is an automated online
card catalog of publicly accessible information. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin
95-01, 7 December 1994, and OMB Memorandum, 6 February 1998, mandates that all federal agencies
create a GILS record for information available to the public. Within DoD, GILS is referred to as the
DoD Resource Locator and may be found at http://sites.defenselink.mil.

C1.4.5. (AF) Only approved IDAs may deny all or parts of records. FOIA managers may: initially deny
fee category claims, requests for expedited processing, and waiver or reduction of fees; review fee
estimates; and sign “no records” responses. IDAs are the deputy chiefs of staff and chiefs of comparable
offices or higher at HQ USAF and Secretary of the Air Force (SAF), and MAJCOM commanders.
MAJCOM commanders may appoint two additional positions at the headquarters and also the wing
commander at base level. MAJCOM inspectors general (IG) and MAJCOM Directors of Inquiries (IGQ)
may act as IDAs for IG records. MAJCOM FOIA managers must notify AF-CIO/P in writing (by
facsimile, e-mail, or regular mail) of IDA position titles. Send position titles only--no names. AF-CIO/P
provides SAF/IGQ a courtesy copy of correspondence designating IDA positions for IG records. When
the commander changes the IDA designee position, MAJCOM FOIA managers advise AF-CIO/P
immediately. In the absence of the designated IDA, the individual filling/assuming that position acts as
an IDA, however; all denial documentation must reflect the position title of the approved or designated

                                                  153
IDA, even if in an acting capacity (i.e., Acting Director of Communications and Information,
Headquarters Air Combat Command).

C1.5.3. (AF) Responsibilities. The Air Force Chief Information Officer (AF-CIO) has overall
responsibility for the Air Force FOIA Program. The Plans and Policy Directorate (AF-CIO/P)
administers the procedures necessary to implement the Air Force FOIA Program, submits reports to
Director, Freedom of Information and Security Review (DFOISR), and provides guidance and
instructions to MAJCOMs. Responsibilities of other Air Force elements follow.

C1.5.3.3. (Added)(AF) MAJCOM commanders implement this instruction in their commands and
agencies and appoint a FOIA manager in writing. Send the name, phone number, office symbol, and
email address to AF-CIO/P, 1155 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1155.

C1.5.3.6.4. (Added)(AF) Make frequently requested records [FOIA (a)(2)(D)] available to the public in
the FOIA ERR via the internet. As required by AFIs 33-129, Transmission of Information Via the
Internet, and 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures, OPRs request clearance of these records
with the PAO before posting on the WWW, and coordinate with JA and FOIA office prior to posting.
The FOIA manager, in coordination with the functional OPR or the owner of the records, will determine
qualifying records, after coordination with any interested OCRs.

C1.5.9.9. (AF) In some cases, requested records are available from the GPO and NTIS, 5285 Port Royal
Road, Springfield VA 22161. These organizations offer certain records for sale to the public. Current
standard releasable Air Force publications are available electronically on the WWW. For requesters
without electronic access, NTIS has paper copies for sale. Give requesters the web address or NTIS
address when appropriate. However, if the requester prefers to pursue the FOIA process, consult with
AF-CIO/P through the MAJCOM. Refer FOIA requests for Air Force publications that are classified,
FOUO, rescinded, or superseded to the OPR through the appropriate FOIA office.

C1.5.12. (AF) Keep records that were fully released for 2 years and denied records for 6 years. Include
in the 6-year record file copies of records or parts of records that were released in response to the same
request. Refer to Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule (converting to
AFMAN 33-322, Volume 4). The functional OPR or FOIA office may keep the records released or
denied. The FOIA office keeps the FOIA case file for each request. The FOIA case file consists of: the
initial request; tasking to OPRs; OPR's reply; memoranda for record (MFR) of phone calls or other
actions related to the FOIA request; DD Forms 2086, Record of Freedom of Information (FOI)
Processing Cost, or 2086-1, Record of Freedom of Information (FOI) Processing Cost for Technical
Data; final response; and any of the following, if applicable: extension letter; legal opinions; submitter
notification letters and replies; the appeal and required attachments (except for the released or denied
records if maintained by the OPR); and all other correspondence to and from the requester.

C2.1.2.4.2. (AF) AF-CIO/P will make the traditional (a)(2) materials (Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(A), (B),
and (C)) available to the public. Each Air Force activity must make Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(D) records
(“FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) records”—records which they determine will, or have become, the subject
of frequent or subsequent requests) available to the public in a reading room in hard copy and
electronically by posting it to their appropriate web site. There is no requirement to make all
FOIAreleased records available electronically. The FOIA manager, in coordination with the functional
OPR, or the owner of the records, will determine qualifying records, after coordination with any
interested OCRs. As required by AFIs 33-129 and 35-101, OPRs request clearance of these records with
the PAO before posting on the WWW.

                                                    154
C2.1.2.4.2.1. (Added)(AF) Normally, if the FOIA office or OPR receives, or anticipates receiving, three
or more requests for the same record in a quarter, they will consider it a frequently requested record
(FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) record) and make it publicly available in hard copy and electronically as
outlined in paragraph C2.1.2. OPRs may elect to make other records publicly available if they receive,
or expect to receive, less than three requests a quarter. The purpose is to make records available in an
ERR to potential future FOIA requesters instead of waiting to receive a FOIA request, and reduce the
number of multiple FOIA requests for the same records requiring separate responses. In making these
determinations, recognize there are some situations in which a certain type of record becomes the
subject of simultaneous FOIA requests from all interested parties and then ceases to be of interest.
Activities may typically receive a “flurry” of FOIA requests for contract records immediately after a
contract is awarded, but do not receive any subsequent requests for such bulky records after that point.
In some cases activities may decide that placing records in the ERR would not serve the statutory
purpose of “diverting some potential FOIA requests for previously released records.”

C2.1.2.4.2.2 . (Added)(AF) GILS. Each activity that posts FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) records (records
which they determine will, or have become, the subject of frequent or subsequent requests) must create a
GILS record for each FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) record and post it to DefenseLINK. The OPR prepares
the GILS record. You can complete and submit a GILS record on-line using a web browser. Instructions
for completing the GILS record, and an on-line form are at http://sites.defenselink.mil. Follow the steps
listed on the web page. The GILS site on DefenseLINK will serve as the central index of Air Force
FOIA (a)(2)(D) records.

C2.1.2.4.2.3. (Added)(AF) In addition, installations will post a list, or index, of locally produced FOIA-
processed (a)(2)(D) records on their web page at their FOIA site. Each listing will point or link to the
particular record. In addition, MAJCOMs may choose to post their own index of MAJCOM specific
FOIA-processed (a)(2)(D) records to their appropriate web site. Installation web pages will include the
following phrase (or similar words) on their FOIA site if they do not have any frequently requested
FOIA records: “There are no frequently requested FOIA records to post at this time.” Include the
following statement, or a similar one, on the installation web page with the records: “Some records are
released to the public under the FOIA, and may therefore reflect deletion of some information in
accordance with the FOIA’s nine statutory exemptions. A consolidated list of such records is on
DefenseLINK.” Link the word “DefenseLINK” to http://sites.defenselink.mil/index.html#register and
click on “Browse,” and “FOIA Electronic Reading Room Documents.” Qualifying releasable records
with exempt information redacted must show on the record the amount of information withheld and the
exemption reason (for example, (b)(6)). Activities with such records should provide the public an index
and explanation of the FOIA exemptions. All installation FOIA pages will include the capability for
FOIA requesters to send an electronic FOIA request, contain a link to their Reading Room, and include
a link to the Air Force FOIA page, http://www.foia.af.mil.

C2.2.2.2. (AF) AF-CIO/P makes the appropriate (a)(1) materials available for the Air Force.

C3.2.1.3. (AF) AF-CIO/P will provide the current DoD (b)(3) statutes list to the MAJCOMs. You may
access the current list of DoD (b)(3) statutes by going to http://www.foia.af.mil, click on “Resources,”
and “FOIA (b)(3) Exemptions.”

C3.2.1.6. (AF) AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program provides guidance on collecting and
safeguarding social security numbers (SSN). Paragraph 3.3.3. states: “SSNs are personal and unique to
each individual. Protect them as FOUO. Do not disclose them to anyone without an official need to
know.” Before releasing an Air Force record to a FOIA requester, delete SSNs that belong to anyone
                                                   155
other than the requester. In any subsequent FOIA release to a different requester of those same records,
make sure SSNs are deleted. When feasible, notify Air Force employees when someone submits a FOIA
request for information about them. The notification letter should include a brief description of the
records requested. Also include a statement that only releasable records will be provided and we will
protect personal information as required by the FOIA and Privacy laws. Personal information may not
be posted at publicly accessible DoD web sites unless to do so is clearly authorized by law and
implementing regulation and policy. Personal information should not be posted at nonpublicly
accessible web sites unless it is mission essential and appropriate safeguards have been established. See
also AFIs 33-129 and 35-101.

C3.2.1.6.2.2.2. (Added)(AF) MAJCOM FOIA managers will ensure the list of sensitive and routinely
deployable units is reviewed in January and July, and will follow that review with a memo to the Air
Force Personnel Center (HQ AFPC/MSIMD), 550C Street West, Suite 48, Randolph AFB TX 78150-
4750, either validating the current list or providing a revised listing based on the current status of
deployed units at that time. This listing is in American Standard Code for Information Interchange
(ASCII) format on a 3-½” (double-sided, high density) diskette, that contains the unit's eight-position
personnel accounting symbol (PAS) code, with one PAS code per line (record)(8-byte record). The
MAJCOM FOIA manager will send an electronic copy of the list of nonreleaseable units to HQ
AFPC/MSIMD that is included in the personnel data system. The MAJCOM and HQ AFPC FOIA
offices will use it to determine releasable units. This reporting requirement is exempt from licensing
with a reports control symbol (RCS) in accordance with AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and
Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information
Collections.

C3.2.1.7.1.3. (AF) Guidance provided in paragraph (AF) C3.2.1.6. also applies to SSNs in records
compiled for law enforcement purposes. Do not disclose SSNs to anyone without an official need to
know.

C4.3.1.3. (AF) For Privacy Act records, refer to AFI 33-332 for specific disclosure rules. For releases to
GAO and Congress, refer to AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations With Congress and AFI 65-401, Relations
With the General Accounting Office.

C5.2.5.1. (AF) A request is officially received when it is received by the FOIA office of the activity
responsible for the records. See also paragraphs C1.5.3.7 and C1.5.4.2. Examples of interim response
letters to requesters are included in Appendix 7.

C7.1.1.1. (AF) MAJCOM FOIA managers and AFLSA/JACL send a consolidated report for the fiscal
year on DD Form 2564, Annual Report Freedom of Information Act, to AF-CIO/P by 30 October via
regular mail, e-mail, or facsimile. AFLSA/JACL will prepare the appeals and litigation costs sections of
the report. AF-CIO/P will make the Air Force report available on the WWW.

C7.1.2.2.3. (AF) A corresponding statute is required for each instance entered in the Exemption 3 block.
List the statute by number, not title. For any statute on the report that is not on DoD’s list of commonly
used (b)(3) statutes, attach a copy of the pertinent page of the statute that states information must be
withheld from public disclosure. AF-CIO/P makes the DoD list available to FOIA managers
electronically. Statutes on the DoD list with an asterisk indicate they are valid (b)(3) statutes from
litigation. Do not enter any of the following as (b)(3) statutes:

                                                   5 U.S.C. 552

                                                   156
                                                5 U.S.C. 552a

                                                28 U.S.C. 1498

                                                18 U.S.C. 1905

C7.1.2.3. (AF) For AFLSA/JACL Only: Enter the total number of FOIA appeals received and total
number of FOIA appeals completed during the fiscal year.

C7.1.2.9.4.4. (AF) MAJCOMs and bases do not include the 25 percent. AF-CIO/P will add to the final
Air Force report to DoD.
