     specific directives and mission requirements. The office of primary responsibility (OPR) for
     this instruction is the AFPOA/CCS. Any conflicts with other directives shall be brought to
     the attention of AFPOA/CCS immediately. Directors will ensure maximum distribution to
     all assigned personnel.
2. Protecting Personally Identifiable Information.
     2.1. The AFPOA seeks to ensure appropriate measures are implemented to protect the
     privacy of individuals’ Personally Identifiable Information (PII) whether physical or
     electronic (In accordance with AFI 33-332 Air Force Privacy Act Program). Protecting PII
     is important to you, your coworkers and AFPOA’s customers, all of whom rely on each of us
     to be responsible and accountable for safeguarding data. All employees must protect any
     personal information they handle in the course of their work. It is vital that the collection,
     retention, storage, use, and disposal of all PII be handled appropriately.
     2.2. The following guidelines for the protection of PII must be followed at all times:
        2.2.1. Training. All military, civilian and contractor personnel shall receive PII training
        from the AFPOA Privacy Act Point of Contact (POC), upon in-processing and prior to
        DoD system access and handling documents that contain or use PII. This training is
        reflected on the AFPOA In-Processing Checklist Item ―AFPOA Information Review
        (On-Line)‖. Training can be accessed at the following link- PII Training.
        2.2.2. Social Security Numbers (SSN). The use of the SSN shall be limited to
        transactions that specifically require the presentation of the SSN to meet statutory or
        regulatory requirement. Use of the SSN includes the SSN in any form, including, but not

        Manager, and Records Manager must be received prior to short and long term storage of
        records containing PII in AFPOA and non-AFPOA facilities. A PII inventory checklist
AFPOAI36-100 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                                     3


       containing disposition and point of contact (POC) information is required for all actions
       above.
       2.2.6. Breach Reporting. AFPOA personnel will immediately report any loss, theft, or
       compromise of PII to the Director, Information Assurance Manager, and the AFPC
       Privacy Act Manager.
       2.2.7. Emails with Privacy Act Information or PII. Any emails that contain FOUO
       information, Privacy Act Information and PII, will have the following statement at the
       beginning of the email. "The information herein is For Official Use Only (FOUO) which
       must be protected under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. Unauthorized disclosure
       or misuse of this PERSONAL INFORMATION may result in criminal and/or civil
       penalties."
3. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requests and/or Privacy Act Requests.
   3.1. AFPOA/CCS is the POC for FOIA and Privacy Act requests involving AFPOA.
   3.2. AFPOA FOIA requests will be routed through the AFPC FOIA Manager. The request
   will then be routed to AFPOA/CCS. The AFPOA/CCS will notify AFPOA Directors of all
   FOIA and Privacy Act requests received.
4. Safety.
   4.1. As members of this agency, you have the right and the responsibility to accomplish your
   job safely. While it is the Director’s responsibility to ensure programs are in place to
   implement Air Force guidance, it is the responsibility of each member to know and comply
   with these directives. These measures must be integrated into all on-duty and off-duty
   operations and activities. AFPOA employees must be prompt in reporting injuries/illnesses
   to supervisors; reporting safety, fire, and health hazards/deficiencies; and giving due
   consideration to both personal safety and that of coworkers.
   4.2. Supervisors are ultimately responsible for ensuring their subordinates are briefed on
   various work-related hazards and the appropriate reporting of safety mishaps. Supervisors
   are also responsible for documenting completion of initial and recurring job training on the
   AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, and maintaining strict control over the
   document. Attachment 4 contains a sample AF Form 55 for reference.
   4.3. The responsibility of the unit safety representative(s) is to assist leadership in
   maintaining an AFPOA mishap prevention program, disseminate safety information and help
   supervisors develop briefings, etc., conduct spot inspections, and serve as a focal point for all
   safety matters.
5. Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault and Equal Opportunity, and Treatment.
   5.1. Treating one another with dignity and respect must be the foundation of our daily
   personal interactions. Members cannot and must not allow obstacles to exist that create a
   hostile work environment or which hinder the abilities of our people to flourish. These
   obstacles include, but are not limited to, sexual harassment, sexual assault and violations of
   Air Force equal opportunity and treatment guidelines. In short: AFPOA/CL will not tolerate
   any acts of discrimination.
 4                                                       AFPOAI36-100 17 DECEMBER 2012


     5.2. AFPOA will support and adhere to policies set forth by Air Force leadership on these
     matters. Familiarize yourselves with Air Force Instructions that provide greater detail into
     these matters and which include appropriate phone numbers for referral agencies. To be
     sure, anyone in AFPOA who believes he/she is the victim of unlawful discrimination should
     know that many avenues and support agencies are available for consultation. Give your
     chain of command an opportunity to resolve the matter. However, this does not in any way
     preclude you from seeking assistance through agencies such as the Inspector General,
     Chaplain or the Military Equal Opportunity/Equal Employment Opportunity offices.
     5.3. Leadership at all levels will swiftly resolve any suspicions or complaints of unlawful
     discrimination. Keep all personnel informed of the status of your actions and maintain open
     lines of communication.
     5.4. These are critical times in the organization and in the Air Force. There is no place in
     this organization, or our Air Force for that matter, for personnel who fail to recognize the
     infinite worth of others by engaging in inappropriate behavior. The AFPOA leadership takes
     these matters seriously and call-on all AFPOA personnel to do the same to ensure workplaces
     are free from offensive and/or unlawful discriminatory behavior.
6. Family Care Plan (FCP).
     6.1. All military members who are single parents, dual military couples with family
     members requiring care, and members with civilian spouses who have unique family
     situations as determined by the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) First Sergeant must
     complete a FCP. The FCP consists of an AF Form 357 and all applicable Powers-of-
     Attorney (POA). The AF Form 357 can be found on the Air Force Publications website.
     POAs can be obtained from the base legal office. Once all documentation is completed by
     the member, the First Sergeant will review/validate the FCP and sign the AF Form 357. The
     original AF Form 357 and copies of all POAs will be filed and maintained by the First
     Sergeant.
7. Telephone Recall Rosters.
     7.1. AFPOA Directorates will review and update recall rosters no later than the 1st of each
     month (or the preceding Friday if the 1st falls on a weekend). All recall rosters are
     maintained in the AFPOA/CCS Restricted Drives. All rosters will be updated monthly,
     regardless of personnel changes and reflect the new date (current date as of change). When/if
     changes occur out of cycle, directorate admin will update appropriate recall roster and send
     to AFPOA/CCS.
     7.2. AFPOA/CCS will provide AFPOA/CL and AFPOA/CD with updated copies of all
     recall rosters.
     7.3. Protect Recall Roster information IAW AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program,
     paragraph 6.1.1.1.
8. Physical Fitness for Active Duty Military Members.
     8.1. In support of the CSAF’s ―Fit-to-Fight‖ program, AFPOA’s physical fitness policy is
     designed to enhance our physical fitness levels, promote overall deployment readiness, and
     boost unit morale.
AFPOAI36-100 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                                  5


   8.2. In accordance with AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program, all AFPOA military personnel will
   participate in active physical fitness programs at least three sessions per week. Unit Fitness
   Program Manager will designate at least one of the three sessions as a mandatory session.
   All Directorates should allow attendance on a regular basis. This will enhance unit cohesion,
   team building, and promote physical fitness.
   8.3. Service members with personal or physical fitness waivers are required to provide a
   copy of profile or limitation documentation to their Physical Training Leader (PTL) and
   attend AFPOA’s mandatory session. Member will coordinate with the individual PTL to
   provide appropriate exercise routines to minimize risk of further injury.
   8.4. The unit physical training weekly formation is mandatory. Alternate or make-up
   physical training sessions are to be used if personnel have a unique situation that prevents
   them from attending the mandatory session(s). Directors will encourage all military
   personnel to attend sessions, schedule permitting. AFPOA’s goal is to increase physical
   fitness levels by promoting a healthier lifestyle with emphasis on nutrition, education, and
   participation.
9. Physical Fitness for Civilian Employees.
   9.1. The Air Force policy on civilian employees participating in physical fitness activities
   recognizes the mission benefits of a healthy and fit lifestyle. To encourage our employee’s
   participation, appropriated fund, civilian employees assigned to AFPOA may voluntarily
   participate in physical fitness activities as an excused absence within specific guidelines.
   9.2. Physical fitness activities are considered to be excused absences in accordance with
   AFI 36-815, Absence and Leave, paragraph 8.1.1. Supervisors may authorize—conditions
   and workload permitting—participation during duty hours without charge to the employee’s
   leave or loss of pay. Civilian employees and supervisors are encouraged to consider
   participation in organized unit military fitness to increase unit morale and cohesiveness as
   part of their program.
   9.3. Physical fitness activities are limited to 3 hours a week. Procedures and requirements
   outlined in attachment 2 will apply. Attachment 3 contains a form that will be processed
   through the employee’s supervisory chain, with a doctor’s statement attached, and included
   in the supervisor’s employee record. This program must be carefully managed to be
   equitable and fair to those employees who choose not to or are unable to participate.
   9.4. Directorates may require employees to sign in when they participate in the physical
   fitness activities, at the base gym.
10. Civilian Personnel Work Schedule.
   10.1. In accordance with AFI 36-807, Weekly and Daily Scheduling of Work and Holiday
   Observances and AFMAN 34-310, Non-appropriated Fund Personnel Program
   Management and Administration Procedures, AFPOA/CL has established the following
   guidance for AFPOA appropriated fund employees and non-appropriated funded employees
   respectively.
       10.1.1. Tour of duty is defined as an employee’s scheduled days of work within a 2-
       week pay period.
 6                                                      AFPOAI36-100 17 DECEMBER 2012


        10.1.2. Regular tour of duty is a 5-day, 8 hours-per-day work week, Monday-Friday, for
        a total of two 40-hour weeks in the 80-hour pay period. Supervisors may assign
        alternative schedules outside of the regular tour of duty (after hours and weekends), if
        required to accomplish the mission.
        10.1.3. Lunch periods of 1 hour will be taken between the hours of 1100-1300.
        Supervisors may also grant rest periods in accordance with AFI 36-807, paragraph 4.3.
        10.1.4. AFPOA’s normal hours of duty are 0730-1630 with a 1-hour lunch period.
        AFPOA’s core hours are 0900 -1500 – these are the peak hours when the organization is
        the busiest. Core hours are defined according to Office of Personnel Management
        (OPM), as the designated period of the day when all employees are at work. This
        allows a supervisor to alter work schedules to better fit personal needs and help balance
        work and personal responsibilities. Supervisor may authorize flexible working hours at
        the beginning or end of the core hours, such as 0600-1500; 0700-1600; 0800-1700; 0900-
        1800.
        10.1.5. This guidance will be used by all supervisors when establishing work
        schedules/tours of duty for civilian employees and may be used to establish the same for
        military personnel.
11. Training Support.
     11.1. AFPOA/DPHA is the POC for training requirements. They can be reached at the
     following email address: afpoa.dph.assurance.support@us.af.mil.
     11.2. AFPOA Workforce Development Strategy is changing ―Training‖ to ―Learning‖.
     Continuous learning will be considered part of the core job. To achieve training and
     development, the AFPOA Workforce Development Strategy consists of a 3-part approach:
        11.2.1. Self-managed and self-serviced free training and education tools (i.e. IT E-
        Learning/Books 24/7; Safari books/video; Microsoft Office; and in-house tools &
        expertise).
        11.2.2. Utilize ―no cost‖ classroom training (i.e. free local area training seminars and
        conferences).
        11.2.3. Employ other agencies money & resources (i.e. AF Information Technology and
        Office of Personnel Management).
     11.3. Each Directorate will appoint a Directorate Training Liaison (DTL) who will work
     closely with the AFPOA Training office. The DTL will track and submit necessary training
     requirements as requested by directorate personnel and will monitor out of cycle training
     requirements. DTLs will also be responsible for submitting annual training requirements to
     the AFPOA Training office.

   POLICIES/PROCEDURES FOR PHYSICAL FITNESS ACTIVITIES FOR AFPOA
                        CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES

A2.1. Supervisors may authorize—conditions and workload permitting—excused absences for
physical fitness activities during duty hours. These activities are limited to 3 hours a week at the
supervisor’s discretion. However, physical fitness activities will not be allowed on any work day
in which overtime or compensatory time must be worked or which will subsequently drive
overtime or compensatory time.
A2.2. When an employee elects and is approved to participate in the civilian PT program, he/she
will be allowed up to 3 hours on-the-clock time in a personal exercise program spread over the
work week. The time cannot be accumulated from week to week and includes time for dressing,
showering and cleaning up.
A2.3. To minimize time away from work but maximize the benefit, exercise during the normal
workday must occur convenient to the employee’s work site. The exercise period may be taken
anytime during the day, including: in conjunction with the lunch period; at the beginning of the
workday; or at the end of the workday. However, the employee must report to the first- or
second-level supervisor before going to the exercise site and report back to the supervisor and
work after the exercise period—unless the employee is going to PT at the end of the workday.
Specifically, there is no requirement for the employee to report back to his/her supervisor if the
PT occurs in the last hour of work.
A2.4. Supervisors may establish a sign-in/-out board for all participants in the physical fitness
program and may conduct random checks of participants during the physical fitness activities.
If the employee participates in an organized base class or unit exercise event, the official sign-in
roster maintained by the instructor/PT leader will suffice as the reporting requirement.
A2.5. An employee desiring to participate in the physical fitness program must complete the
request form at Attachment 2. The first-level supervisor makes a recommendation and the
second-level supervisor approves or disapproves.
A2.6. When requesting permission to participate in the physical fitness program, the employee
is required to provide a doctor’s statement that physical fitness activities are permitted with or
without limiting conditions. Acquiring the doctor’s statement will be at the employee’s expense.
A copy of the doctor’s statement will be placed in the employee’s file maintained by the
supervisor and a second copy provided to AFPOA/CCS.
A2.7. Exercise periods will be scheduled with approval of the supervisor to accommodate
workload. The supervisor has the prerogative to modify or cancel exercise periods to satisfy
mission requirements.
A2.8. All physical fitness time will be recorded on the employee’s time sheet as ―LV‖ with
―Physical Fitness‖ in the remarks.
A2.9. All first- and second-level supervisors will monitor the physical fitness program for
impact on AFPOA’s mission and resources (e.g., timely/accurate accomplishment of work,
customer service, excessive overtime or compensatory time, misuse by employees, benefit to
employees, etc.).

  REQUEST FOR APPROVAL OF EXCUSED ABSENCE AND MEMORANDUM OF
         UNDERSTANDING FOR PHYSICAL FITNESS ACTIVITIES

EMPLOYEE: (Please Print Name)

I, _____________________________________________, request approval of an excused
absence not to exceed 3 hours a week for the sole purpose of participating in physical fitness
activities.

I understand the following (employee must initial each line):

____I may only utilize on-base facilities during any period of excused absence for physical
fitness activities and not for free time away from work.

____My participation is subject to supervisory scheduling and second-level supervisory
approval. I agree that management may cancel my participation in this program anytime.

____If my request is not approved or I cannot be released from work for physical fitness
activities due to mission requirements, I may not challenge the decision unless the decision can
be proven to be arbitrary or capricious.

____I must record each absence on my timesheet with the appropriate code for excused absence
(LV), along with the remark ―physical fitness.‖

____My 3 hours a week (recommend adding 1.5 for part-time) ―on the clock‖ may be spread
throughout 5 days and the time will not be accumulated from week to week. The time will
include time spent dressing, showering and cleaning up to return to work (unless my PT occurs
at the end of my workday).

____I must report to my immediate supervisor or second-level supervisor before going to the
exercise site and report back to work after exercising (unless my PT occurs at the end of my
workday). If required by my supervisor, I must sign in/out at the appropriate level to record
participation.

____In order to enhance mission effectiveness, I must make every effort to improve my health
and well-being during any period of excused absence for the purpose of physical fitness.

____This request must be accompanied by a doctor’s statement at my own expense that physical
fitness activities are permitted with or without limiting conditions.

____Should my ability to participate in physical fitness activities become limited in any manner,
I will notify my supervisor immediately.
