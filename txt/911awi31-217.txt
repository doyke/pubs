This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directives (AFPD) 31-1, Integrated Defense. It
establishes the policies and procedures for the issue, use, and collection of contractor access
badges at Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station (PARS). This instruction applies to all personnel

employees are US citizens or have permanent residency cards in addition to submitting a valid
criminal background check through the Pennsylvania State Police IAW AFI 31-201 8.6.4.3.
They will also submit an application for a contractor identification badge to the Contracting

officer/administrator will complete the request using AF IMT 2583 and forward to the 911 SFS
OPS email account for processing at least 14 days prior to the scheduled contract start date.

criminal records check and forward the verification to the SF Pass and Registration section for
badge issuance upon contractor arrival. NOTE: The contractor is responsible for providing
