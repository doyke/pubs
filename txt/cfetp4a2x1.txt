1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive core training document that
identifies lifecycle education and training requirements and training support resources for Biomedical
Equipment personnel. The CFETP provides Biomedical Equipment personnel a clear career path to success and
instills rigor in unit-level training.

2. Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training.
Civilians occupying these positions will be graduates of a DoD BMET Training Program; or be graduates of a
formal civilian BMET training program; or have 2 years of field experience as a Biomedical Equipment
Technician (BMET). Certification as a Certified Biomedical Equipment Technician (CBET) through the
International Certification Commission (ICC) is highly recommended.

3. The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors should use both parts of the plan to plan, manage, and control
training within the career field.

3.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains the
purpose and use of the plan; section B explains career field progression, duties and responsibilities, training
strategies, educational information, and provides a career field progression flowchart; section C associates each
skill level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, training, education, experience, and other); section D
indicates resource constraints (i.e., 3/5/7/9 level formal/OJT training). Some examples of restraints are funds,
manpower, equipment, and facilities. Section E is the transitional training guide. Section F describes unique
requirements for Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard personnel. AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted
Classification, contains the job descriptions.

3.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes
duties, tasks, and technical references to support the formal 3-skill level apprentice course, and the 5 and 7 skill
level career development courses (CDC); section B contains the Course Objective List and is not currently in
use. Section C contains the support materials list and is also not currently in use. Section D is the Training
Course Index, which contains information on the basic and supplemental courses; section E contains any Major
Command (MAJCOM) unique requirements (there are no MAJCOM unique training requirements at this time);
section F identifies medical specific requirements for documentation of training. These packages are indexed in
AFIND 8 and are coded as distribution F. At unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan,
and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

4. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and
efficient training at the appropriate point in their career. This plan will enable us to train today's force for
tomorrow’s jobs.

                                  SECTION A, GENERAL INFORMATION


1. Purpose of the CFETP. The CFETP provides information for career field managers, commanders, training
managers, supervisors, trainers, and the technical training to use to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an
effective career field training program. The plan outlines the training individuals must receive to develop and
progress throughout their career. The plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and
continuation training. Initial skills training is the AFSC specific training an individual receives upon entering
into this specialty. For our career field, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) at Sheppard AFB,
Texas by the 882d Training Group provides this training. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses,
task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion required for award of the 3, 5, 7, and 9
skill levels. Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in
a specific duty position. This training program occurs during and after the upgrade training process. It is
designed to provide the performance and skills/knowledge training required to do the job. Advanced training is
formal Air Force Specialty training used for selected airmen. Continuation training is additional training, either
in-residence or exportable training courses, or on-the-job training provided to 3, 5, 7, and 9 skill level personnel
to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required. The CFETP also serves the following
purposes:

1.1. A management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program. It is also used
to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.

1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in this specialty and recommends
training and education throughout each phase of an individual's career.

1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery
method.

 1.4 Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field training
program

2. Use of the CFETP. The Air Force Career Field Manager maintains the CFETP. MAJCOM Functional
Managers and AETC will review the CFETP annually to ensure currency and accuracy, and forward
recommended changes to the Air Force Career Field Manager. MAJCOMs must ensure training isn't developed
that can be satisfied by existing courses. This plan will be used at all levels to ensure a comprehensive and
cohesive training program is available/instituted for each individual in the career ladder.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident and exportable training based on requirements
established by users and documented in Part II of the CFETP. They will also work with the Air Force Career
Field Manager to develop procurement and acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the
identified training.

2.2. The MAJCOM Functional Managers will ensure MAJCOM training programs complement the CFETP
mandatory initial skills and upgrade requirements. OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable
courseware/courses can satisfy identified requirements. MAJCOM developed training to support this Air Force
Specialty (AFS) must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate training already available.

2.3. Each individual will complete mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. Part II, Sections A
and B, will be used to determine required training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The Air Force Career Field Manager for AFSC 4A2X1 and AETC training
personnel will identify and coordinate career field training requirements. The Air Force Career Field Manager
for AFSC 4A2X1 has final approval authority on all training matters for AFSC 4A2X1.

will ensure individuals receive viable training at the appropriate points in their career. The following narrative
and AFSC 4A2X1 career field flowcharts identify the training career path. It defines the training required in an
individual's career.

2.1. Apprentice (3-skill level) Training. Initial skills training. The specialty consists of the tasks and
knowledge training provided in the 3-skill level resident course (J8ABR4A231 00AA, PDS code IAR) located
at Sheppard AFB, Texas, described on the Education and Training Course Announcements website,
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/. Initial skills training requirements are driven by the Specialty Training Standard
(STS). The STS was developed from data collected from the Occupational Survey Report, December 2003. All
Individuals must complete the initial skills course to be awarded AFSC 4A231.

2.2. Journeyman (5-skill level) Job Qualification Training. This specialty has a 5-skill level awarding
Career Development Course (CDC). Qualification at the 5-skill level is awarded only after successful
completion of the CDC, on-the-job training or granted a waiver by the 4A2 Career Field Manager and
recommended by the supervisor.

2.3. Craftsman (7-skill level) Training. This specialty has a 7-skill level awarding CDC. Qualification of the
7-level is awarded upon successful completion of the CDC (once available), on-the-job training, recommended

5. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Enrollment in CCAF occurs automatically upon
completion of basic military training. Additional off-duty education is a personal choice that is encouraged for
all. Individuals desiring to become an AETC Instructor must possess, as a minimum, an associate degree or
should be actively pursuing an associate degree. Special duty assignment (SDA) requires an AETC instructor
candidate to have a CCAF degree or be within one year of completion (45 semester hours [SH]). A degreed
facility is necessary to maintain accreditation through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Science Degree. In addition to the associate
degree program, CCAF offers the following:

5.1. Occupational Instructor Certificate. Upon completion of instructor qualification training consisting of a
basic instructor course, supervised practice teaching, CCAF instructors who possess an associate degree or
higher may be nominated by their school commander/commandant for certification as an Occupational
Instructor. This certificate qualifies an individual to teach in vocational type schools in numerous states.

5.2. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill certification is awarded
for the primary occupational specialty. The College uses a competency based assessment process for trade skill
certification at one of four proficiency levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman/Supervisor, or Master
Craftsman/Manager. All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.

5.3. CCAF Course Description. This section contains the codes and descriptions of the CCAF courses that
are segments of Air Force-conducted courses. CCAF courses are identified by seven character codes, such as
BET 1320. The three letters identify the course area (in the example, BET represents Biomedical Equipment
Technology) while the four digits identify the specific course within that area. CCAF courses are subject to
increases/decreases of credit hour value because they are continually evaluated and revised as necessary to meet
the immediate needs of the Air Force. The credit hours entered on the CCAF transcript reflect the value of the
                                                      10
courses when they were completed. The CCAF transcript is the only official and reliable indicator of an
airman’s accomplishments in terms of courses completed and semester hours earned. Questions regarding
CCAF courses should be directed to CCAF/AYX, 130 W Maxwell Ave, Ste 33, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-

                                                     PART II

                             SECTION A, SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD


1. Implementation. Implementation of this STS, technical training provided by the Air Education and
Training Command, starts with class number 20050304 entering 4 March 2005 and graduating 5 January 2006
for course J3ABR4A231 010 (Course number changed to J8ABR4A231 00AA effective 13 Jun 05).

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, this STS:

2.1. Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and
technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.

2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training
requirements. Use automated training management systems to document technician qualifications, if available.
Task certification must show a certification/completed date.

2.3. Shows core task requirements. Core tasks are identified by a “5” in column 2 of the STS and are required
for upgrade to the 5-skill level in the biomedical equipment technician specialty.

2.4. Contains the proficiency code key (columns 4A, 4D, 4E, and 4F) used to indicate the level of training and
knowledge provided by resident training and the career development courses. Columns 4B and 4C indicate
what is being taught in the Army and Navy service specific training portion of the DoD Biomedical Equipment
Technician Course.

2.5. For documentation, decertification/recertification and transcribing procedures, reference AFI 36-2201,
Volume 3.

2.6. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the supervisor identifies STS training
references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover the core
requirements as outlined in the CFETP Part II and any mandatory items in AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted
Classification. For two-time CDC course exam failures, supervisors identify all STS items corresponding to the
areas covered by the CDC. The trainee completes a study of STS references, undergoes evaluation by the task
certifier, and receives certification on the STS. NOTE: Supervisors must document Career Knowledge prior to
submitting a CDC waiver.

2.7. Training Standard. Trainees are trained, evaluated, and certified to the go/no go level. Go means the
individual can perform the task without assistance and meet requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct
use of procedures. Supervisors and superintendents will manage this process by assessing 4A251 qualifications.

2.8. Trainers must be certified in the task to be trained, be recommended by the supervisor and complete a
formal trainer course.

2.9. Certifiers must be at least a SSgt (E-5), with a 5-skill level or civilian equivalent, be capable of evaluating
the task being certified, be someone other than the trainer, and have complete a formal certifier course.
Possession of at least a 7-skill level in the same AFSC is desired, but not required.

2.10. This STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System
(WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron
by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS
subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher
grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are
in chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System. WAPS is not applicable to the ARC.

3. Recommendations. Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to 382 TRS/XYBB,
939 Missile Road, Sheppard AFB TX 76311. Reference specific STS paragraphs when forwarding reports.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific
task. (Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or
for a subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

X This make is used alone in course columns to show that training required but not given due to limitations in resources.

NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.

                                                      71
                            SECTION E, MAJCOM UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS

1. Purpose. The following information applies to the Air Reserve Component (ARC) and serves to provide
ARC Biomedical Equipment Technicians (BMET) apprentices (non-prior-service and retrainees) with an
opportunity to receive the additional training days necessary to become proficient in maintaining biomedical
equipment that is identified in this STS as a core task. This section applies to all BMET’s assigned to all Air
Force Reserve and Air National Guard medical and aeromedical evacuation squadrons (referred to, hereafter, as
medical unit).

1.1. Qualification (also referred to as proficiency or seasoning) training requirements:

1.1.1. Qualification training days is available for ARC BMET apprentices to satisfactorily initiate and complete
the core task training requirements identified in this STS.

1.1.2. Upon completion of the DoD Biomedical Equipment Technician Course, J8ABR4A231 00AA, all
BMET apprentices will be assigned to a Medical Equipment Repair Center (MERC) for up to 120 days
(minimum of 90 days) to acquire proficiency in performing the core tasks required to successfully achieve the
5-skill level according to Air Force upgrade training guidelines.

1.1.3. For optimal results, this follow-on training should commence immediately following graduation from the
Biomedical Equipment Apprentice Course.

1.2. Advanced planning is required to ensure the apprentice receives qualification training immediately upon
graduating from the DoD Biomedical Equipment Technician Course. With concurrence from the ARC medical
unit commander, the section BMET supervisor, in conjunction with the senior air reserve/health technician must
contact the regional MERC to arrange follow-on training for the newly assigned BMET trainee (4A2X1). This
process should also be coordinated with the guard/reserve liaison at Sheppard AFB. The MERC may
recommend the apprentice receive upgrade training at a qualified AF MTF if extenuating circumstances (i.e.,
lack of qualified available staff, committed to supporting contingency operations, etc) fail to permit the
apprentice from receiving the training at the MERC. (A qualified MTF is defined as a facility that possesses the
time, equipment, and expertise necessary to train the apprentice on all core tasks as outlined in this STS.)
Active duty personnel must ensure that an experienced BMET supervisor is assigned to assist the apprentice in
gaining the desired confidence and proficiency. The training schedule must be finalized prior to the Biomedical
Equipment Apprentice Course start date.

1.3. Ship the apprentice’s BMET toolkit to the guard or reserve liaison at Sheppard AFB. The BMET
apprentice requires a toolkit to perform follow-on qualification training at the scheduled regional MERC.
(NOTE: All BMETs in the active, guard, and reserve require an AF standard issue toolkit to perform duties
during peacetime and contingency operations. ARC BMETs are issued a toolkit from their unit of assignment.)
Four weeks before the apprentice graduates from the apprentice course, the senior air reserve/health technician
will ship the BMET tool kit to the guard or reserve liaison depending upon which component the apprentice is
assigned to. The reserve liaison can be reached at DSN 736-6707; the guard liaison can be reached at DSN
736-6812. The address is as follows:

                  Air National Guard (or Air Force Reserve) Liaison
                  511 9th Street, Bldg. 920, Rm. A100
                  Sheppard AFB TX 76311

1.4. To ensure continuity between BMET resident training and qualification training at the regional MERC, the
student will forward a copy of his or her technical school certificate to his or her unit of assignment. The ARC
unit of assignment will then initiate upgrade action using AF Form 2096 to award the 3-skill level and enter the
apprentice in the appropriate training status code.

1.5. The apprentice BMET AFSC upgrade training requirements may be accomplished at his or her civilian
MTF under the direct supervision of an experienced, qualified BMET supervisor. If the apprentice BMET is
employed as a BMET in the civilian sector, has immediate access to the same types of biomedical equipment
identified in this STS, and does not receive the appropriate number of qualification training days necessary to
successfully complete all core tasks, then this training may be accomplished at the apprentice’s civilian MTF
under the direct supervision of a qualified BMET. The apprentice must present the supervisor with his or her
original copy of the Biomedical Equipment Technician STS. As the required core tasks are successfully
                                                        72
completed, the supervisor is authorized to sign-off on the STS indicating that the apprentice has satisfactorily
completed each core task.

1.6. The ARC medical Reserve unit may submit a waiver to bypass the above qualification training if
proficiency days are unavailable. In the case where qualification training days are unavailable at the base and
the headquarters, the proficiency training may be waived until such time that days become available and the
apprentice has an opportunity to train on the equipment identified in this STS. The waiver package must be sent
to the AF 4A2 Career Field Manager, Air Force Medical Logistics Office, Ft. Detrick, MD through HQ
AFRC/ANG Biomedical Equipment Functional Manager. The AFRC Functional Manager can be reached at
DSN 497-1893; the ANG Functional Manager can be reached at DSN 278-8577.

                             SECTION F, DOCUMENTATION OF TRAINING

                                    DOCUMENTATION OF TRAINING
                                          (Medical Specific)


1. Work Center Training Plan and the Enlisted Training and Competency Folder. The focus of this
training guidance is to bring all training documentation back into one “OJT” record. Changing medical training
requirements by JCAHO created a need for additional ways to document training outside the OJT record. The
end result was that each training location created different means to document training; a standardized process
was needed. Air Force Instruction 36-2201, Volume 3, authorizes Career Field Managers to bring training
documentation back into one “OJT” record, thus the creation of the Enlisted Training and Competency Folder.
All Biomedical Equipment Technician personnel, from Airman Basic to Chief Master Sergeant, will have an
Enlisted Training Competency Folder.

1.1. The folder will be kept current for the present duty position. The following information provides specific
guidance along with recommended documentation, consistent with current Air Force instruction/directives.
This training guidance has focused on two main areas: 1) developing a Master Training Plan and 2)
documenting training in the Enlisted Training and Competency Folder

2. Master Training Plan (MTP). The MTP is a reference guide developed for each section that includes all
facets of training for individuals assigned. It is to be used as a reference source for the type of training and
documentation pertaining to each assigned member. The MTP is used to standardize training and to give
trainers, trainees, supervisors, NCOICs and OICs an overview of the training process for the duty section. The
MTP is also used as a means to reduce the amount of paperwork previously required during the training
process.

2.1. The MTP is an overview of training for the duty section and it should include all documents involved in
the training process for the duty section. Training will vary from section to section and person to person, but
there are certain documents that will be a standard requirement for all MTPs. They are listed below.

2.1.1. Master task list (MTL).

2.1.2. Current CFEPT or AFJQS.

2.1.3. Locally developed AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard (JQS) Continuation Sheet (if applicable).

2.1.4. Milestones for tasks and CDC completion (identify the projected time frame the trainee will complete
their core tasks and each set of CDCs as required).

Note: Any one-deep work centers, or those with fully qualified senior NCOs (skill level commensurate with
their grade), require only a MTL.

3. Documentation of Training (The Enlisted Training and Competency Folder). The purpose of this
section is to provide guidelines and examples of proper documentation for the many forms used in training all
Biomedical Equipment Technician personnel (4A2X1s). Training documentations help to assess readiness
capability, individual strengths and weaknesses, and resources needed to support quality patient care. It also
aids compliance with Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and regulatory
requirements. The Enlisted Training and Competency Folder is limited to the forms presented here and those
prescribed in AFI 36-2201. The unit training manager can provide assistance with training documentation.

3.1. Preparing the 4A2X1 Training and Competency Folder. To assemble a 4A2X1 training record, utilize a
standard 6-part folder (NSN 7530-00-990-8884, Folder, 6 Section). Attach a computer generated or typewritten
label on the front cover titled “Enlisted Training and Competency Folder”. In addition, include the
members/trainee’s full name (Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial), rank and last 4 digits of the SSAN. This
label will be centered and attached to the top half of the front cover of the 6-part folder, as viewed in portrait
orientation. An AFVA 205-15, Privacy Act Statement, will be centered and attached to the bottom half of the
front cover. To facilitate filing, other sections of the 6-part folder are discussed in detail in the paragraphs
below.
                                                       74
3.2. Index tabs/tabbed dividers may be used in parts that contain multiple documents. When multiple copies of
any form are placed in the OJT record, they are placed in chronological order with the most current
documentation on top. When building the new 6-part folder, the parts of the folder will contain the documents
filed in the sequence, shown in Figure 1.

3.2.1. Part 1, the first two-pronged section, is located inside the front cover. AF Form 55 - Employee Safety
and Health Record, is also maintained in Part 1, regardless of grade or training status. AFI 91-301, Air Force
Occupational and Environmental Safety Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) Program, June 1996, authorizes
supervisors to file the AF Form 55 with the AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder.

3.2.2. Part 2 Section A should contain the AF Form 623B. Note: IAW AFI 36-2201, maintenance of AF Form
623 is mandatory for all Airmen in grades Airmen Basic through Technical Sergeant. In addition, an AF Form
623 is required for SNCOs regardless of grade, in retraining status or as directed by the Air Force career field
manager. A two-part adhesive backed form, AF Form 623b, is available and will be used to document 4A2X1
training in lieu of the cardboard folder version of AF Form 623. Place the two-part form on cardstock or similar
durable material and place in Part 2 of the Educational Folder. Transfer all information from the old form to the
new one. Ensure all appropriate areas of the form are properly completed before posting in Part 2. This
document is formally recognized by the personnel system in contingencies and deployments as the official
"cover" of the formal training record.

3.2.2.1. Part 2 Section B should contain the entire Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP).

3.2.2.2. Part 2 Section C should contain the AF Form 797 (see Figure 2). The three sections within part 2
should remain in the proper order, with section A being on top.

3.2.3. Part 3 Section A, contains AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training. This form
is used to document qualification in tasks that require recurring, mandatory, and/or in-service training. The
following subparagraphs provide examples of how part 3 must be subdivided to document specific types of
special or recurring training. AFSC 4N0X1 examples were used in illustrating AF Form 1098 documentation.

3.2.3.1. AF Form 1098s in Part 3, Section A, documents mandatory recurring training (see Figure 3) and in-
service training. Examples are BLS training, Patient Sensitivity training, and other mandated training as
stipulated by JCAHO standards, Air Force, or facility directives. Mandatory training requirements may vary
from facility to facility. At a minimum, these requirements should be reviewed on an annual basis and updated
as required.




                                                                          76

3.2.3.2. AF Forms 1098 in Part 3, Section B, document ongoing completion of Qualification Training Packages
(QTPs) if applicable (see Figure 4). Air National Guard sustainment training will also be documented in this
section. Air Force Reserve sustainment training will be documented on AFRES Form 16, Sustainment Training
Program, and filed in this section. The initial completion of a QTP is documented in the CFETP. Each QTP
required for the duty section will be maintained in the MTP and will be used as a training source document.
Locally developed competency packages can be utilized until QTPs are available.

    AF FORM 1098, APR 85 (EF)                                       PREVIOUS EDITION IS OBSOLETE


                                                                     77
3.2.3.3. AF Forms 1098 in Part 3, Section C will be used to document RSV training. The printable form from
the RSV website may be used to document this training.

3.2.4. Part 4 Section A will contain the AF Form 623a, OJT Training Record Continuation Sheet/Automated
Product. This form will be utilized to document all progress of individual training to include facility
orientation, duty section specific orientation, upgrade/job qualification training, additional pertinent training,
career development course (CDC) failures/corrective actions, skill level/task decertification procedures, and
supervisor/trainer/certifier entries. The entire process must be well documented on this form (See Figures 5,
5.1, 5.2). All individuals involved in the training process must document training progress as it occurs in this
section. (Both the supervisor and trainee must sign and date all entries). Progress/status of members in upgrade
training status will be documented at least monthly.

3.2.4.1. The following subparagraphs give examples of information that should be documented.

3.2.4.1.1. Upgrade training (5-7-9-skill levels).

3.2.4.1.2. Document the members entry into upgrade training and periodic (minimum monthly) evaluations of
training progress.

3.2.4.1.3. Information on extensions, waiver requests, or breaks in training should also be clearly documented
with copies of any related correspondence.

 3.2.4.1.4. Any further training pertinent to the duty section and or unit effectiveness can also be documented on
the AF Form 623a; i.e. job qualification.

3.2.4.1.5. Document any decertification proceedings to include dates, reasons for decertification, and other
applicable information on the AF Form 623a.

3.2.4.1.6. Once an individual completes upgrade training commensurate to his/her rank and maintains an
appropriate skill level, his/her supervisor should continue to review requirements, progress, and individual
training needs. OJT record reviews should, at a minimum, coincide with member’s performance feedbacks to
ensure documentation currency and appropriateness.

3.2.4.2. The Job Description /Performance Standards for each duty position should be maintained in the MTP
within individual duty sections. An AF Form 623a reflecting the members job description/performance standard
will be maintained in Part 4 of the OJT record. Note: An AF Form 623A overprint/automated product may be
used to document both supervisor/subordinate reviews (see figure 7). The following statements will be
annotated and jointly reviewed by the supervisor /subordinate:

3.2.4.2.1. “I know where to find a current copy of my Job Description/ Performance Standards.”

3.2.4.2.2. “I have read, discussed with my supervisor, and understand my Job Description/Performance
Standards.”

3.2.4.2.3. “I understand my duties and responsibilities for the position that I am currently working in.”

3.2.4.2.4. “If I have questions or concerns about my Job Description/Performance Standards, I will seek
assistance from supervisory personnel in my chain of command.”

3.2.4.2.5. “It is my responsibility to review my Job Description/Performance Standards with my supervisor
during each feedback session and with each change in supervisor/duty position.”

3.2.4.3. A signature and date block for both supervisor and subordinate will reflect mutual understanding of
above statements. Recommend several signature and date spaces for continual review process when
overprint/automated products are utilized.

                                                 (Trainee Orientation)


______________________________ has been briefed on the On-The-Job Training (OJT) Program and how
he/she fits into the program while in upgrade training (UGT). Upgrade training was explained as a dual channel
process designed to qualify an Airman for skill level upgrade. Dual channel OJT is a systematic reportable
application of self-study and the craftsman/apprentice principle. Trainees acquire job qualification while
performing on the job under supervision. This combination, knowledge and job position qualification
constitutes the dual channel concept. Requirements from AFIs 36-2101, 36-2201 and AFMAN 36-2108 were
covered. AF Forms 623, 623a, 797, 2096, and the CFETP, STS/JQS or automated JQS, which serves to make
up the individual training record, was explained. Responsibilities of the commander, base training, unit
education and training manager (ETM), immediate supervisor, trainer, and trainee were discussed. The career
development course (CDC) was briefly discussed and will be explained in detail when the CDC arrives, if
applicable. Requirements for upgrade in AFSC 4A2X1 are: (1) satisfactory completion of CDC 4A251A and
CDC 4A51B, (2) supervisor certification of job qualifications with adequate hands on training, (3) completion
of the 4A271 CDC, when available, and (4) supervisor recommendation for upgrade. Each Airman in grades
E1 through E6 (and SNCO’s in retraining status) have an AF Form 623, which must contain a CFETP or JQS.
The CFETP or JQS may contain 150 or more separate tasks but it should be annotated to show only those tasks
the Airman is required to perform in his/her current duty position, all AFMAN 36-2108 mandatory
requirements for upgrade, and core task requirements. In the JQS there is a space for both the supervisor and
the trainee to initial to certify training is complete. In the CFETP the trainer, trainee, and certifier has a space to
initial when training is completed. After upgrade the CFETP or JQS will continue to be used to document
further qualification training.
