  aircraft to the IC who will then allow the CDDAR team to render any further any aircraft
  safing procedures if required.
  7.5. When the aircraft has departed the runway area, if possible, tow the aircraft back onto
  the runway/taxiway, exercising caution with regard to power setting of the tow vehicle.
