     agenda from team issues, champion cross-functional Mission Support Group (MSG) issues,
     and approve and publish minutes. The team may form additional action teams to address
     specific issues as required.
4. Objectives/Measures:
     4.1. Objectives:
        4.1.1. Provide a formal MSG working team to continually improve installation and
        mission support.
        4.1.2. Be a proponent for cross-functional issues at ACC, and if necessary, Air Staff
        levels.

        efficiency.

        4.1.5. Sponsor a MSG/CC orientation program.
        4.1.6. Take on other initiatives as determined appropriate by the team to best serve base
        operating support and the needs of ACC.
        4.1.7. Integrate teams among functional areas to reduce layers and provide a more
        efficient use of man-hours.
        4.1.8. Encourage crossfeed among MSGs and advocate sharing of lessons learned and
        best practices through the HQ ACC/A7 Community of Practice (CoP).
     4.2. Measures:
ACCIPTMD38-303 28 MAY 2010                                                                        3


       4.2.1. The MSG/CC survey is a measure that allows senior leadership to provide
       feedback to gauge organizational effectiveness. The survey is given to all ACC
       MSG/CCs on an annual basis. Survey questions focus on HQ ACC support and
       effectiveness. The survey will target improvements and provide feedback to the staff.
       4.2.2. IBST action items may be submitted to the executive secretary in various ways to
       include via IBST teleconferences, email, or the issue format (Attachment 2,
       Recommended HQ ACC IBST Issue Format). All action items will be captured on the
       tracker, and the tracker will be kept on the IBST CoP. The IBST has established a CoP
       for the chair, principal members and advisors to use as a means to submit background
       materials (bullet background papers, briefing slides, etc) to resolve problems or provide
       guidance to IBST action items. For most issues, the team will provide a recommendation
       or resolution procedure back to the base within 30 days from when the issue is submitted
       to the team.
       4.2.3. The IBST will form action teams, as required, to target cross-functional issues and
       key support processes.
5. Parameters. The IBST works issues involving more than one mission support directorate.
Functional staffs will continue to work all issues specific to their organization, though this forum
provides an opportunity to cross-flow best practices and maximize information flow across the
directorates. Issues should be submitted to the IBST executive secretary, HQ ACC/A7Z, and
must provide a concise, factual statement of the issue. Issues submitted by ACC bases should be
forwarded through the wing commander or MSG/CC. State why the issue is cross-functional
and requires IBST review, versus a single functional director. Provide as much data and backup
information as possible, so that the team can take appropriate action. The status of each issue is
tracked by assigning a number and a response will be provided back within 30 days.
