2.1.1. Appoint a BAT superintendent. The BAT superintendent should have experience in
ABGD.
2.1.2. Maintain overall supervision of the BAT.
2.2. The BAT superintendent will:
2.2.1. Solicit and select qualified volunteers for the BAT from the base population.
2.2.2. Establish training requirements, schedule and conduct training as required in coordination
with other agencies.
2.2.3. Maintain operational control of the BAT during all exercises.

MEMORANDUM FOR HQ ACC/IG
FROM: 355 FW/CC
        5275 East Granite Street
        Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ 85707-3012
SUBJECT: Simulation Request – Platform Test Branch
1. NUMBER: See Simulation Guidance Letter
2. TYPE SIMULATION: Procedural or Resource - ASM 208 Platform Test Branch (Short
Title)
3. REQUESTOR: 355 XXX/CC (Col Xxxxx), DSN 228-xxxx
4. JUSTIFICATION: This is the only bench of this type on base. This test bench cannot be
used without the pedestal assembly, which is bolted to the floor. Unbolting the pedestal
assembly would render the INS shop incapable in capable of testing and repairing the MX-7299
platforms, until the pedestal assembly could be surveyed and recalibrated.
5. UTCs: XXXX
6. INCREMENT NUMBERS/ULD/ULN line numbers: XXX
7. COST AND/OR IMPACT IF NOT APPROVED: Approximate time to reassemble and
calibrate is 72 hours
8. WORKAROUND: It will be simulated by the use of shipping containers with appropriate
markings and documentation.
