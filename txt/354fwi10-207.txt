When the Battle Staff/CAT is formed, the CP supports the WOC, and is an integral portion of the Com-
mander's C2 function. Time permitting, all tasking of the WOC is accomplished through a central point.
The WOC is also the operations control function for all units assigned or attached to the wing for flying
operations. The WOC requires communication with assigned/augmenting flying squadrons, maintenance
control, departure control, the Tactical Air Control Center, Control and Reporting Center, and the Air
Support Operations Center.
