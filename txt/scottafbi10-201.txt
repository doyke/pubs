SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: Recall options six through nine have been added as personnel type specific recall
options. This is reflected in Attachment 4 of this instruction. Alert and notification venues
have been expanded to include Scott Air Force Base (SAFB) Advisory Radio Station
(SAFBARS). Unit Control Centers (UCC) have replaced the Commander’s Support Staff as the
unit level reporting and accountability center. Objectives for reporting have changed to reflect
100% accountability at R+3 as the only measurable goal in the recall process.

1. Overview. This instruction establishes procedures for alerting and recalling personnel in the
event of national emergencies or other contingencies as directed by command authorities.
Recalls may be necessary to support war plans, periods of increased readiness, emergencies, or
disaster situations. This instruction ensures the capability of the 375 AMW Commander, the
Crisis Action Team (CAT), and unit commanders to quickly disseminate information and
instructions to all assigned, attached, or tenant unit personnel.
2. Responsibilities.
    2.1. Command Post.
       2.1.1. The 375 AMW Scott Command Post (CP / (SCP)) is responsible for the overall
       operation of the notification/recall/alert system.
SCOTTAFBI10-201 10 MARCH 2010                                                                  3


     2.1.2. After duty hours, once SCP activates recall procedures, SCP will initiate the
     SAFBARS. During duty hours, the 375 AMW Public Affairs (PA) will facilitate radio
     recall messages.
     2.1.3. The SCP will transmit a Crisis Action Team (CAT) activation report to HQ AMC
     once the CAT has been manned and again when the CAT deactivates, in both cases using
     the prescribed format.
  2.2. Unit Commanders/Staff Agency Chiefs will:
     2.2.1. Devise unit recall plans/rosters in support of this instruction. Units will ensure
     their rosters are current. All assigned personnel must maintain a current copy.
     2.2.2. Recall key civilian personnel and key contractor personnel, at their discretion,
     unless otherwise directed. Consideration should be given to the provisions in the
     Collective Bargaining Agreement, memorandums of agreement, overtime pay, and
     contract provisions.
     2.2.3. Determine appropriate procedures for recalling shift workers and personnel on
     leave or TDY.
     2.2.4. Be responsible for releasing personnel (once recalled and accounted for).
     2.2.5. Be responsible for devising plans, policies, and training to activate runners for use
     in communication outage situations, to include classified courier duty.
     2.2.6. Immediately notify the CAT Exec (or SCP if CAT is not activated) through UCCs
     whenever a problem has been discovered that could hinder an effective recall.
     2.2.7. Notify the 375th Security Forces Control Center (SFCC) of changes to home
     addresses of personnel listed in Attachment 2.
  2.3. The 375 AMW/PA will:
     2.3.1. PA will coordinate with higher headquarters for guidance during recall actions and
     based on posture, will respond to media queries or initiate statements.
     2.3.2. During non-duty hours, the SCP will post overt recalls on the commander’s access
     channel (CAC) and the SAFBARS. Only recalls of an unclassified nature will be
     broadcast over the CAC and SAFBARS. All recalls of a classified nature, including
     exercises for mobility readiness, will not be broadcast.
  2.4. The 375th Logistics Readiness Squadron Readiness Flight (375 LRS/LGRDX) will
  notify Unit Deployment Managers (UDM) of mobility requirements (e.g. mobility bags
  required to be issued to personnel).
  2.5. The 375th Force Support Squadron Installation Personnel Readiness (375 FSS/IPR) will
  compile and report personnel strength and accountability to the CAT and the Air Mobility
  Crisis Action Team as required.
  2.6. UCCs will:
     2.6.1. Accomplish operational training within 90 days of initial appointment and on a
     quarterly basis thereafter.
     2.6.2. Contact the 375 FSS/IPR to schedule strength reporting training.

       2.6.3. Contact 375th Civil Engineers Emergency Management (375 CES/CEX) to
       schedule UCC training.
       2.6.4. Maintain current recall rosters.
       2.6.5. Maintain training documentation.
       2.6.6. Prepare messages to recall personnel who are TDY or on leave out of the local
       area (within the CONUS), if required by wing recall guidance or unit commander
       direction. Sample messages are Attachments 6 and 7.
    2.7. All 375 AMW personnel will:
       2.7.1. Ensure all personal location information required for an accurate unit recall roster
       is provided and updated.
       2.7.2. Comply with recall instructions.
       2.7.3. In the event of unit accountability, if personnel are unable to contact their
       respective UCC they will use one of the following options:
           2.7.3.1. Contact SCP at 618-256-5891 COMM or 576-5891 DSN.
           2.7.3.2. Contact HQ AFPC/PRC at 1-800-435-9941 to report location and status.
           2.7.3.3. In the event personnel are located within a designated disaster area, register
           with AFPASS at https://afpass.af.mil/cas/logon.           This system allows for
           accountability of all Department of the Air Force personnel and their family
           members.
3. Activation.
    3.1. When directed by the 375 AMW/CC or designated representative, the SCP will
    implement activation by notifying key personnel listed in Attachment 2.
       3.1.1. Key personnel will subsequently activate their recall plans. Once contacted, each
       individual is responsible for contacting the next person in their respective chain until all
       affected personnel have been notified.
       3.1.2. Each individual is responsible for relaying the recall message verbatim, as
       received. If an individual cannot be contacted, note it, and continue with the next
       individual in the chain. Pass on all non-contacts to the next person notified.
       3.1.3. The last individual(s) in the notification process will contact their respective UCC
       with the completion time and names of all personnel not contacted.
       3.1.4. Units will continue to attempt to notify personnel not contacted until 100 percent
       notification/accountability has been accomplished.
    3.2. Leaving messages on answering machines, voice mail, personal e-mails, etc., is not
    considered contact. In these cases, the next individual in the chain will be notified. Do leave
    messages for these individuals to contact their unit for instructions.
    3.3. Recall Test. All personnel notified will continue the test by calling the next person in
    line on their recall roster until all personnel are notified. Personnel will not report to their
    duty sections. Personnel on leave or TDY will not be notified. The last individual(s) in the
    notification chain will contact the UCC with completion time. The UCC will notify the unit
SCOTTAFBI10-201 10 MARCH 2010                                                                 5


  commander. It is the prerogative of the unit commander to determine their unit notification
  process.
  3.4. The SCP will relay the 375 AMW/CC or designated representative’s message using the
  following phrases with additional information as necessary.
     3.4.1. The 375 AMW/CC (or designee) has directed activation of the CAT/<EOC>.
     Report to <primary / alternate> area <immediately / at _________L.>. UCCs are
     activated at this time. Note: Wing, group, and/or squadron commanders may activate
     individual UCCs at their discretion. UCCs will notify the CAT when activated. Note:
     The CAT and UCC’s will automatically activate when Emergency Operations Center
     (EOC) is recalled/activated or when any wing recall is initiated.
     3.4.2. The 375 AMW/CC (or designee) has directed a <covert> <base / wing / group /
     squadron> recall. Option <1, 2, 3, 4>. Complete your alert notifications and follow
     option instructions. Recall time is _____Z/_____L. See Attachment 3 for pyramid
     recall procedures/options template. Each unit must review and add verbiage specific to
     their unit mission and function.
         3.4.2.1. OPTION 1. All military and designated key and essential civilian personnel
         report to your designated UCC to sign in then report to your duty section.
         3.4.2.2. OPTION 2. All military personnel report to your designated UCC to sign in
         then report to your duty section.
         3.4.2.3. OPTION 3. All military personnel, except shift workers, report to your
         designated UCC to sign in then report to your duty section
         3.4.2.4. OPTION 4. All military and designated key and essential civilian personnel
         except shift workers report to your designated UCC to sign in then report to your duty
         section.
         3.4.2.5. OPTION 5. This is a telephone pyramid notification for all military and
         designated key and essential civilian personnel; report to duty at next regularly
         scheduled time, unless directed otherwise.
         3.4.2.6. Options 6 through 9 are sample telephone pyramid notification messages that
         further clarify extent of personnel notification. Verbiage can and should be altered to
         reflect unit requirements.
     3.4.3. The 375 AMW/CC (or Designee) has directed a <covert> <base / wing/ group/
     squadron> alert. Complete your alert notifications and remain on telephone alert until
     <further notice / ______ L>. Alert Time is ______Z/_______L.
     3.4.4. This is a test of the <base / wing / group / squadron> notification system. Recall
     not required. Continue notifications. Note: Items in angle brackets will be used/omitted
     as the situation dictates. Covert refers to a recall or alert in which personnel respond as
     quickly as possible without giving public notice and minimizing actions, which might
     alert the general public. Also, commanders may add unit-specific supplemental remarks,
     but should keep them to a minimum and be cognizant of operational security (OPSEC)
     requirements.
6                                                        SCOTTAFBI10-201 10 MARCH 2010


    3.5. Group commanders or equivalents are responsible for additional notifications to
    subordinate individuals/agencies required to be present when the CAT/<EOC> has/have been
    activated. CAT/<EOC> augmentees will report directly to the CAT/<EOC> when notified.
    Accountability of CAT augmentees and EOC members will be reported to respective UCCs
    by the CAT/<EOC> staff.
    3.6. The notification message from the SCP should state either primary or alternate
    CAT/<EOC> location for activation. If primary or alternate CAT/<EOC> location is not
    specified, assume primary.
    3.7. When testing the recall system:
       3.7.1. Status reports are not required nor will the augmentee program be implemented.
       3.7.2. This test is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the recall system, but
       personnel are not required to report to their duty stations.
       3.7.3. Tested units will record the time the communications test is completed (last person
       contacted) and report the results back to their UCC. This information will be provided to
       the IRP no later than close of business the first duty day following the test or as directed.
    3.8. Unit developed recall systems will be tested and documented at least quarterly. All
    UCCs are required to forward results to Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR).
    3.9. Assembly Area. Unless otherwise directed, when recalled, personnel will immediately
    sign in at their respective UCC without compromising safety then report to their duty section,
    remaining there until released by their unit commander. Do not delay the recall process by
    eating, showering, shaving, etc. Wear utility uniforms (BDUs, ABUs, flight suits, etc.)
    unless this would cause a significant delay. Wear of reflective belts is mandated for 375
    AMW personnel. Personnel in transition training will report to unit of assignment, not unit
    of training. Personnel not permanently assigned to a Scott AFB unit but administratively
    attached to a Scott AFB unit will report to their unit-designated assembly area.
    3.10. Additional recall and reporting requirements for the first responders/disaster response
    forces/emergency responders/emergency support functions and EOC can be found in the
    Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2. Exceptions: Personnel
    currently serving any type of augmentee duty report to the duty area assigned at the time of
    the recall, e.g. augmentees to Security Forces actively on shifts report to Security Forces.
    “On-loan” personnel require special processing for accountability. Recall procedures are in
    the physical work center, but the administrative roll of reporting personnel status remains
    with the “loaning” organization. The physical unit of daily duties for on-loan members will
    provide each UCC accountability of individuals, mirroring the group/squadron reporting tool
    (Ref: Attachment 5). Example: A lieutenant is physically located in the XP office but
    assigned to LRS. This individual signs in with XP and XP sends an e-mail verification of the
    accountability of the lieutenant to the LRS UCC. Note: CAT support staff (XP and
    augmentees) will report directly to the CAT during recalls. Chief of XPO will call recall
    status into the respective UCC. Augmentees will call their respective UCC and report they
    are present for duty at the CAT. CAT duty is considered a critical function and as such, will
    be operational prior to most UCC’s being manned.
4. Notification Methods.
SCOTTAFBI10-201 10 MARCH 2010                                                                   7


   4.1. The telephone system is the primary means for notification; however, any
   communication system can be used to notify personnel by the fastest means available.
   Individuals on leave/TDY must receive direct notification. Second party telephone
   notifications and/or answering machine messages are not acceptable.
   4.2. Public Address System Announcements.
      4.2.1. The 375 AMW/CC may direct security forces to initiate public address system
      announcements in base housing areas and common areas such as the gym, ballparks,
      pavilions, etc.
      4.2.2. Public announcements may also be made over giant voice and base CAC.
      4.2.3. The 375 AMW/CC may direct PA and/or the SCP to initiate a SAFBARS
      announcement.
   4.3. Units should consider designing their recall systems using the geographic location of
   their personnel as a primary factor (i.e., separating personnel living on base and those living
   off base). See Attachment 3, sample template for unit pyramid recall roster. This method
   will allow selected communities to be notified and also expedites the process when
   communication systems are inoperable. To facilitate a rapid and orderly recall, rosters
   should be organized in a logical sequence with key personnel notified first; including those
   individuals who collect and report recall status information.
   4.4. Communications outage (COMM-OUT).
      4.4.1. Unit commanders/staff agency chiefs will ensure procedures are developed to
      achieve 100 percent contact of unit personnel during communications outage situations,
      normally utilizing a runner system. Units will have maps with detailed directions to
      identify the exact location of living quarters of each unit member who resides on base
      and for those who reside off base.
      4.4.2. The SCP will contact the SFCC for door-to-door notification of key personnel
      living on base. The SFCC will maintain a current list of addresses of all key personnel
      listed in Attachment 2 who are living on base.
      4.4.3. Unit developed COMM-OUT systems will be documented and tested at
      commander discretion.
   4.5. OPSEC. Protecting information is crucial during any recall. Do not use terms such as
   A-hour, C-Day, L-hour, ORI, Crisis Look, etc., or reference times over non-secure means.
   Agencies/personnel requiring reference times will develop procedures to obtain them from
   their respective CAT representative via secure means (standard test equipment, runner, etc.).
5. Personnel Strength Reports.
   5.1. The UCC is responsible for recording and reporting personnel strength to their squadron
   commander and to IPR. The format and definitions to be used for reporting are in
   Attachment 5.
   5.2. Reporting timelines. The first report is due from the UCC to the squadron commander
   and IPR by Reference Start Time (R) +1 hour. The IPR in turn, consolidates the UCC
   reports and reports to the CAT Executive/Recorder at NLT (R) +1:10 hour. Additional
8                                                        SCOTTAFBI10-201 10 MARCH 2010


    reports will be completed with each subsequent hour, until 100 percent, accountability is
    obtained.
    5.3. When a recall is initiated, all assigned/attached personnel will report immediately to
    their duty sections and sign in. Functional areas routinely conducting 24-hour operations or
    requiring crew rest (i.e., security forces, fire department, aircrews, ATC/C2 controllers, etc.)
    may be recalled, placed on telephone standby, or otherwise accounted for at the discretion of
    the unit commander. Full accountability of personnel will be reported in accordance with
    this instruction.
    5.4. For active duty personnel on leave or TDY, see Attachment 6 and Attachment 7 for
    guidelines in use of correspondence for recall purposes.
    5.5. Civilian personnel, to include contractors, will be accounted for NLT 2 hours after the
    start of the next duty day. Example: Recall on Saturday at 1400, would account for all
    military and essential personnel within the 3 hour established criteria, but non-essential
    personnel would be accounted for by 0930 the following Monday morning.
6. Objective. The following objective applies: One hundred percent (100%) of available
personnel present for duty within 3 hours of recall initiation. (R+3)
