                          EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

3.1. Introduction. There are two types of EIT: Aircrew Intelligence Training (AIT) and Force
Protection Intelligence Training (FPIT). AIT will be coordinated with the wing/group tactics
flight or officer. FPIT will be coordinated with force protection (FP) organizations (e.g.,
Security Forces (SF), Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)) as defined in AFI 14-
119, Intelligence Support to Force Protection (FP). (T-2)
     3.1.1. AIT is EIT provided to the units’ assigned and attached aircrew and operators. When
     assigned, the USAF Intelligence Weapons Instructor Course graduate will be directly
     involved with the AIT program. (T-3)
     3.1.2. FPIT is EIT provided by the host unit intelligence function to the unit’s SF and other
     FP support agencies (e.g., AFOSI, Civil Engineering). FPIT will be conducted IAW AFI 14-
     119 and supporting documents. When possible, a FP Intelligence Formal Training Unit
     graduate will be responsible for the management of the FPIT program. If the intelligence
     function is not part of the host unit, the tenant unit responsibilities in AFI 14-119 will be
     adhered to. (T-3)
     3.1.3. Effective training methods will be used and can include, but are not limited to
     briefings, demonstration-performance, formal and informal lectures, and academic training
     sessions. (T-3)
     3.1.4. Training resources can include, but are not limited to threat briefings, current
     intelligence briefings, theater orientation briefings, CDs/DVDs or web-based training
     materials, and weapons system videos. (T-3)
3.2. SIO Responsibilities. The SIO will:
     3.2.1. Establish an EIT program tailored to the unit’s mission, weapons systems, projected
     wartime/Air and Space Expeditionary Force tasking and base/deployment location(s). (T-2)
     3.2.2. Appoint program managers to oversee AIT and FPIT execution. (T-3)
     3.2.3. Assign only qualified trainers to conduct unsupervised EIT. AFI 14-2MC-12,
     Volumes 1 and 2 identify specialized training requirements and evaluation criteria for EIT
     trainers. (T-2)
     3.2.4. Ensure written guidance outlines procedures for conducting, documenting, testing,
     evaluating, monitoring and reporting EIT. (T-3)
     3.2.5. Coordinate EIT written instructions with all applicable commanders. Written
     guidance will be coordinated with any agency that assists intelligence personnel in providing
     training, as well as any agency for which intelligence provides training on a regularly
     scheduled basis. (T-3)
     3.2.6. Develop intelligence training for other base/unit personnel, if appropriate. (T-3)
3.3. Aircrew Intelligence Training.
     3.3.1. The AIT program manager will:

     3.3.1.1. Build an effective training program, including training plans, with input from
     operational squadrons, tactics representatives, aircrew flight equipment (AFE) personnel,
     and Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) specialists, as appropriate. (T-2)
     3.3.1.2. Review training objectives for currency prior to the beginning of the training
     cycle. (T-3)
     3.3.1.3. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
     requirements. (T-3)
     3.3.1.4. Conduct trend analysis following each training cycle; document lessons learned
     and apply those lessons during subsequent cycles. (T-3)
     3.3.1.5. Provide a written evaluation of the wing/group AIT program to the appropriate
     commander(s) at the end of each training cycle. The written evaluation will include at a
     minimum: the percent or number of personnel trained; trend analysis (e.g., high miss
     questions, weak areas); and corrective actions taken. Incorporate feedback as applicable.
     (T-3)
  3.3.2. Squadron intelligence personnel will:
     3.3.2.1. Provide input to and execute the AIT program. (T-2)
     3.3.2.2. Provide questions and answers specific to the squadron's mission for the unit
     master question file (MQF). (T-3)
     3.3.2.3. Administer AIT tests at the end of each training cycle. (T-3)
     3.3.2.4. Document AIT provided. Documentation of AIT will include the names of
     personnel receiving training, date training was accomplished, the topic taught, and the
     name of the trainer conducting the training. In addition, they will provide a written
     evaluation of the squadron’s AIT program to the squadron commander and the SIO at the
     end of the training cycle. (see attachment 2). (T-3)
  3.3.3. The AIT plan will be specifically tailored to meet unit/mission requirements. Teach
  each item in the AIT training plan at least once during the training cycle. Evaluate the
  objectives for each AIT category with a test (85 percent minimum to pass). (T-3)
  3.3.4. Prorate training based on unit contingency operations tempo IAW the appropriate AFI
  11-2MDS, Volume 1. Outline the details of the prorating schedule in the AIT Plan and/or
  other written instructions. (T-3)
  3.3.5. Aircrew intelligence training categories include threat knowledge, visual recognition
  (VR), collection and reporting (C&R), and personnel recovery (PR). Include other categories
  based on the unit’s mission as required. (T-2)
     3.3.5.1. Threat Knowledge. Develop specific threat knowledge training objectives
     tailored to the unit mission, local area, deployment base(s), and forward operating
     locations. Concentrate on threats in selected countries with the potential for direct unit
     involvement. Refer to attachment 3 for minimum standards for threat briefings. The
     references listed at the beginning of this publication can be supplemented with other
     classified and unclassified publications (e.g., National Air and Space Intelligence Center
     products, Tactics Bulletins, Tactics Analysis Reports, Country Studies) when developing
     threat knowledge training materials.

         3.3.5.2. Visual Recognition. Develop specific VR training objectives tailored to the
         weapons system, mission, base and forward operating locations.                  Include
         enemy/adversary, friendly or neutral weapon systems relevant to the operational
         environment, based on unit mission and operations plan (OPLAN)/concept plan
         (CONPLAN) tasking. Identify key differences between friendly weapons systems and
         threat weapon system look-alikes. Incorporate all aspects/angles, theater specific paint
         schemes, national markings and various configurations. Include examples of weapons
         employment to illustrate how threats might appear when employed (e.g., muzzle flashes,
         smoke plumes, burst patterns). Training should teach how to describe threats to assist
         intelligence personnel in positive identification.
         3.3.5.3. Collection and Reporting. Collection and reporting training will focus on items
         necessary to enable aircrew to initiate aircrew-originated reports to capture perishable,
         critical information of intelligence value (e.g., In-flight Report (INFLTREP),

4. The most commonly missed questions were #5, 8, 13, 14 and 21. After further review of
questions 14 and 21, it is likely these questions were missed because they were poorly worded
and difficult to understand. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-2, SA-6, and IEDs
respectively. The squadron intelligence section will increase emphasis on these threat systems
during the next training cycle. Attached is a breakout of the test questions and how many times
each question was missed.
