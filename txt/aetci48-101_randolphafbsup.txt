This publication implements and extends the guidance in AETCI 48-101, 4 October 2000. This
supplement implements AETC Instruction 48-101, Prevention of Heat Stress Disorders. It
establishes procedures for obtaining and disseminating heat stress measurements to Randolph
AFB. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AFM 37-123, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (AF RDS) located at:
https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds_series.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changes to this publication include updates to contact information (paragraph 1.6.3.1.); and
updates to organization/office symbol information (paragraph 1.6.7.1.).

1.2.2. Ensure personnel are trained annually on the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) index,
notification procedures, appropriate preventive measures, and the signs and symptoms of heat
related illnesses and proper interventions.

1.2.3. Ensure procedures are developed and implemented to pass WBGT index and advised
restrictions to all work centers that have workers in outdoor or not air-conditioned areas as soon
as possible. Also, implement acclimatization procedures outlined in AETI 48-101 and ensure
personnel are supplied with adequate drinking water.

1.3.2. Ensure workers are informed of current WBGT index and recommended restrictions,
adequate fluids are available to employees, and implement work rest cycles.

1.3.4. Ensure heat related illnesses are reported as occupational illnesses to the 12th Medical
Group.

1.3.5. Ensure workers are properly acclimatized.

1.6.3.1. Monitor WBGT index whenever the forecasted daily high is at least 85Â°F. Readings
will be collected every hour. Routine monitoring will only be done during normal duty hours
0730-1630 hrs, Mon-Fri, excluding holidays and other non-duty days. During non-duty
days/hours the WBGT index can be requested by calling 321 TRS/MTI, Lackland AFB, at DSN
473-2805/2806 or commercial 671-2805. Monitor WBGT index during exercises requiring wear
of chemical protective clothing or other heavy, restrictive, or impermeable clothing when
outdoor temperatures are predicted to exceed 68F, as requested. Call the Randolph Command
Center at DSN 487-1859 or commercial 652-1859, to notify them of the current WBGT index.
This notification will only occur the first time a duty restriction is advised and at each subsequent
change in recommended restriction.

1.6.3.2. All reading will be documented in the Randolph AFB, WBGT Heat Stress Record,
maintained in the BEF office.
