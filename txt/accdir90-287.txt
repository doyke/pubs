SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Changes include
updates to compliance items and references reflecting new AFI 10-2501 policy, guidance, and
current Air Force Emergency Management Program terminology.
1. General.
     1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRL) are the primary lists
     used during Headquarters Air Combat Command Inspector General (HQ ACC/IG) Unit
     Compliance Inspections (UCI) to access unit compliance with guidance governing each
     particular area of operations. Items in this C&SRL are defined by the HQ ACC and, as
     applicable, ANG staffs and based upon existing “by-law” requirements, executive orders,
     Department of Defense directives, Air Force (AF) and Air Combat Command (ACC)
     guidance, and mission areas deemed critical by AF, ACC and/or ANG leadership to
     assessing and assuring unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective of the
     C&SRL is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
     1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO) represent the highest priority of inspection items
     and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCA) and the
     missions areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier core and
     general compliance items may be stand-alone or subordinate to a CCO. It is the intent of the
     evaluation team to inspect during the UCI, as a minimum, 100% of the CCO items that apply
     to the inspected unit. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the inspection.
     Critical, core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
        1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). A CCO is an area or item where unit
        failure to comply with established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of
        life or serious injury or significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
            1.2.1.1. - Airman development programs
            1.2.1.2. - Ability to deploy forces
            1.2.1.3. - Ability to employ forces
            1.2.1.4. CCO items are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
        1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). A CCI is an item or area that requires special
        vigilance and is important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed
        "Critical." Non-compliance would result in some negative impact on mission
        performance or could result in injury or possible litigations. CCI items are shown in ALL
        CAPS FORMAT.
        1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). A CGI is an item or area deemed fundamental
        to successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in
        minimal impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or
        possible litigation. GCI items are shown in sentence case format.
