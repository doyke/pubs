     instructions have been received from the controlling agency, read/repeat instructions
     verbatim back to confirm accuracy and acknowledgment. Before proceeding, the
     operator will determine visually that the way ahead continues to be clear. It is the
     vehicle operator’s responsibility to remain vigilant to situations that may cause
     damage, delay or hazard to flying or ground operations. Report adverse conditions to
     the controlling agency for corrective action immediately.
     5.2.1.12. Procedures for Emergency Recall of Vehicle(s) from the Controlled
     Movement Area:
        5.2.1.12.1. When directed by the tower to exit the runway/controlled movement
        area, personnel will immediately exit via the closest available taxiway and remain
        at least 150’ from the runway edge.
     5.2.1.13. In the event it becomes necessary to recall personnel from the controlled
     movement area and radio contact cannot be established, TRACAB shall use the
     following methods to re- establish contact:
        5.2.1.13.1. Use the appropriate light gun signals.
        5.2.1.13.2. Cycle the runway lights alternately from the highest intensity to the
        lowest, repeating as necessary, until all personnel and equipment are removed
        from the runway environment.
        5.2.1.13.3. As a last resort contact Airfield Management Operations to dispatch a
        radio-equipped vehicle to establish contact and escort the vehicle out of the CMA.

        and/or vehicle occupants for foreign objects in the tire treads. For a roll-over FOD
        Check, all portions of vehicle tires must be carefully inspected by pulling forward
        (approx ½ tire rotation) after initial check of visible tire area to inspect remaining tire
        area.
        5.17.2.3. Periodically check to ensure tires and treads are free of foreign objects
        when operating on the airfield.
        5.17.2.4. Secure all foreign objects within the vehicle and disposed of it at a trash
        receptacle or remove it from the airfield in a manner that will not cause a FOD risk to
        aircraft at the end of each shift.
     5.17.3. Remain on the paved surfaces to the maximum extent possible. If required to
     drive off the paved surface, they will do so by the shortest route possible and shall
     perform a complete FOD check upon re-entry to the paved surface.
     5.17.4. Take an active part in daily foreign object policing to effectively reduce the FOD
     potential to engines and tires. Special attention shall be given to removing FOD from
     cracks and expansion seams in hard surfaced areas where engines will be operated. If a
     driver observes debris on the airfield, the driver will immediately secure the debris within
     the vehicle and dispose of it at a trash receptacle or remove it from the airfield in a
     manner that will not cause a FOD risk to aircraft.

        (normally Snow Bird4) shall be in radio contact with TRACAB and shall control
        snow removal vehicles operating on or near the runway.
        10.7.3.2. TRACAB's (Base Operation's or service call's) authorization for the
        controlling snow removal vehicle to enter the runway is also authorization for the
        controlling vehicle to bring other snow removal vehicles on and off the runway as
        needed. When instructed to depart the runway, the controlling vehicle shall be
        responsible for ensuring that all snow removal vehicles are off the runway. The
        controlling vehicle shall report off the runway, and state "ALL snow removal vehicles
        are off the runway." NOTE: If vehicles are entering the runway for reasons other
        than snow removal (i.e., crossing the runway to transport equipment), the lead vehicle
        in contact with the TRACAB, must request permission for his vehicle and all
        vehicles traveling with him/her. The trailing vehicles will follow the lead vehicle
        across the runway. EXAMPLE: If Snowbird 4 was escorting two vehicles across,
        transmit: "Thule Tower, Snowbird 4 request to cross runway 26 at taxiway bravo with
        2 vehicles."
        10.7.3.3. When instructed to depart the runway, the controlling vehicle shall be
        responsible for ensuring that all vehicles under his/her control are off the runway.
        The controlling vehicle shall report off the runway. EXAMPLE: "Thule Tower,
        Snowbird 4 and all snow removal vehicles are off the runway.”

                      PHRASEOLOGY / RADIO COMMUNICATION

A4.1. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows

Figure A4.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology
 VEHICLE OPERATOR:                            “THULE TOWER AIRFIELD ONE HOLDING
                                              SHORT (runway) AT (point/intersection) TO
                                              CROSS”
 Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT):            “AIRFIELD ONE CROSS (runway) AT
                                              (point/intersection) REPORT WHEN OFF”
                                              or
                                              “AIRFIELD ONE HOLD SHORT OF (runway)”

NOTE: Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if you do
not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good communications
only occur when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.

Figure A4.2. Sample Read back Instructions
 VEHICLE OPERATOR:                               “AIRFIELD ONE UNDERSTANDS APPROVED
                                                 TO CROSS (runway) AT (point/intersection).
 Note: Airfield 1 visually scans the runway      WILL REPORT WHEN OFF.”
 prior to movement, And then proceeds            or
 across the runway.                              “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLDING SHORT (runway).


 VEHICLE OPERATOR:                               “THULE TOWER, AIRFIELD ONE CROSSING
                                                 COMPLETE, OFF (runway) AT
                                                 (point/intersection).”

 ATCT:                                           “AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER.”

A4.2. If vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they are required to provide a read
back to the ATCT.

Figure A4.3. Sample Hold Short Instructions
 ATCT:                                  “AIRFIELD ONE, PROCEED AS REQUESTED, HOLD

                                        “AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER”.
 ATCT:                                  “AIRFIELD ONE, READ BACK HOLD SHORT
                                        INSTRUCTIONS”.
 VEHICLE OPERATOR:                      “AIRFIELD ONE COPIES, PROCEEDING AS
                                        REQUESTED,
                                        WILL HOLD SHORT RUNWAY 08”

A4.3. Phonetic Aviation Alphabet. Because some letters have similar sounds, like B and P,
the international aviation industry uses the following words to reduce confusion. For example,
Taxiway B would be referred to as Taxiway Bravo on the radio. Vehicle operators must know
and use the following Phonetic Aviation Alphabet:
