2.7.3.7.1.1. (Added)Wing ART Manager will provide initial and recurring training to unit ART
Monitors and commanders and provide the wing commander a monthly update on the status of
UTC readiness.
2.7.3.7.1.2. (Added)Squadron commanders will brief group commanders on a routine basis (e.g.
monthly or weekly), and group commanders will determine what information needs to be
brought to the attention of the wing commander. Unit ART Monitor will create slides and
coordinate through the group commander prior to briefing the wing commander.
2.7.3.7.2.1. (Added)Appoint unit ART Monitors, in writing, must review all items listed in
paragraph 2.7.3.7.2., and have SIPRNET access before contacting the wing ART Manager to
schedule one-on-one training.
2.7.3.7.2.2. (Added)One-on-one training will consist of hands-on training for accessing the
ART database and updating specific UTCs. It will also cover the basic terms, purpose,
definitions, updating, report retrievals, required reporting time constraints, and highlight any
adverse trends.
2.7.3.7.3.1. (Added)Unit ART Monitors will monitor the ART database weekly to ensure their
UTCs do not go overdue and new UTCs are updated in a timely manner.
2.7.3.7.3.2. (Added)Wing ART Manager will monitor the ART database and inform wing
leadership of overdue or not reported UTCs on a weekly basis.
2.7.4.2.1.1. (Added)Commanders will ensure a minimum of two unit ART Monitors are
appointed, in writing, for their respective unit and at least one monitor is available at the home
station at all times to ensure the ART database is updated within 24 hours of a change to a UTC.

data, ensure the data is classified according to applicable security guidance.
2.7.4.10. (Added)Unit monitors will accomplish a 30-day review with the unit commander or
designated representative. Document the review by printing a UTC report. The unit monitor and
unit commander, or designated individual will sign and date the report printout. Monitors will
retain a copy of the most current review. Monitors are encouraged to print out UTC reports after
updates are made for continuity.
2.7.4.11. (Added)Information flow should start with the monitor recording the UTCs assigned
to their UIC via ART database and cross-referenced with the current Air Force UTC Availability
Time Phased Force Deployment Data. Review UTCs to ensure applicability to the unit’s
