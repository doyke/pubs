1. Policy.
     1.1. The CDDAR program is designed to recover crashed, damaged or disabled aircraft in a
     minimum time period consistent with the following considerations:
        1.1.1. The safety of all personnel involved with recovery operations.
        1.1.2. The requirement to reopen the airfield for operational use.
        1.1.3. Prevention of secondary damage to the aircraft.
        1.1.4. Preservation of evidence for mishap investigations IAW AFI 91-202, The US Air
        Force Mishap Prevention Program and AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
             1.1.4.1. Note: The Incident Commander (IC), as prescribed in AFI 10-2501, Air
             Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, is
             responsible for making all command decisions at the incident scene. The IC will
             consult with the Staff Judge Advocate to determine whether a National Defense Area
             (NDA) is needed or if there are any claims issues.
             1.1.4.2. CAUTION: The aircraft and crash site will be disturbed only to the extent
             required to eliminate a potentially dangerous situation to the aircraft, support
             equipment or personnel, and will otherwise remain in an undisturbed state until the
             aircraft is released to maintenance by the Incident Commander.
        1.1.5. In accordance with (IAW) AFI 91-204 when an aircraft is under investigation by
        Interim Safety Investigation Board, recovery operations will not proceed until the board
        president releases the aircraft. Personnel who are not engaged in the investigation will
        remain outside of the recovery area. The crash recovery team may be called upon to
        perform tasks as required by the investigation team.
     1.2. The CDDAR program instruction is procedural and will not take precedence over
     aircraft-specific technical data in recovery of crashed, damaged or disabled aircraft.
        1.2.1. Incidents involving aircraft made up of a composite structure may cause serious
        injury or death to those in contact with it. TO 00-105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue
        and Mishap Response Information, contains information regarding aircraft-specific
        composite component locations and should be consulted when responding to aircraft
        incidents.
