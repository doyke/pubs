                                          Chapter 1

                                         GENERAL

1.1. Scope of Guidance and Procedures. NWRM is a separately defined materiel category;
refer to terms and definitions for detailed description of the OSD definition. The guidance and
procedures prescribed in this document apply to all nuclear sustainment activities directly or
indirectly involved in NWRM management. This includes Air Force supply (base, depot),
transportation, maintenance (base, depot contract/organic), munitions, depot storage, disposal,
and demilitarization.
1.2. Systems. All AF NWRM is classified and managed using multiple information systems
and tools. For example, Integrated Logistics Systems Supply (ILS-S) users will follow existing
procedures found in AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual and those listed in this Instruction
to manage and account for NWRM. Combat Ammunition System (CAS) users will use many
existing procedures found in AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management
and those listed in this Instruction to manage and account for NWRM in CAS.
1.3. Personnel Security Requirements. Personnel who require physical access to classified
NWRM designated as Restricted Data (RD) or Formerly Restricted Data (FRD) must meet the
following requirements.
   1.3.1. Access Requirements to RD and FRD for Department of Defense (DoD) Personnel,
   are governed by DoDD 5210.2, Access to and Dissemination of Restricted Data, as
   implemented by the AF in AFPD 16-14, Information Protection.
   1.3.2. Access requirements to RD and FRD for contractors are outlined in DoDD 5220.22-
   M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, as implemented by the AF in
   AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Management Program.
1.4. (Added-AFMC) Positive Inventory Control (PIC): PIC means the organization must be
able to identify and account for all NWRM by serial number (S/N) and to be cognizant of the
condition and location of these items in near real time within the organization. Notwithstanding
any contrary interpretations, the prevailing interpretation of this guidance will be to maximize
PIC. An organization must be able to produce a list with National Stock Number (NSN), or Part
Numbers (P/N) (except for items in the Combat Ammunition System), S/Ns, and locations and
provide the condition status of all NWRM items within the organization. An organization‘s
NWRM ―footprint‖ consists of those NWRM items possessed, assigned, or issued to the
organization for use, storage, investigation or repair. Organizational leadership and management
shall monitor its NWRM footprint.

                         NWRM MARKING AND PACKAGING

4.1. NWRM Marking: Based on approved technical data and engineering analysis, NWRM
will be marked with UII IAW DoDI 8320.04, Item Unique Identification (IUID) Standards for
Tangible Personal Property; AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management
and Methods and Procedures Technical Order (MPTO) TO 00-25-260, Asset Marking and
Tracking Item Unique Identification (IUID) Marking Procedures. Note: This does not apply to
DOE designed NWRM.
4.2. Packing, Marking, and Documentation Procedures: Specific packing and marking
procedures for NWRM are included in item specific TOs, Air Force published Special Packaging
Instructions (SPI), web-enabled Performance Oriented Packaging (POP) site, 11N-35-51,
General Instructions Applicable to Nuclear Weapons, AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement
of Air Force Cargo, MIL-STD 2073-1, Standard Practice for Military Packaging, MIL-STD-
129, Military Marking for Shipment and Storage; and MIL-STD 130, Identification Marking of
US Military Property, and AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 4. Note: NWRM
containing hazardous materials must be packed, marked, labeled, and documented as required by
DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part 2 Chapter 204.
   4.2.1. Individuals packing NWRM will:
       4.2.1.1. Ensure NWRM requiring packing waivers are submitted IAW AFI 24-203,
       Chapter 9 to the prime AFGLSC packaging center for approval. If approved, the
       AFGLSC packaging center will issue the deviation number to the customer and provide a
       courtesy copy of the deviation information to the responsible NWRM IM.
       4.2.1.2. Ensure NWRM is packaged IAW this Instruction and appropriate documentation
       is prepared IAW AFI 24-203.
          4.2.1.2.1. Individuals appointed IAW paragraph 2.15.5 (other than 2T0 personnel)
          verify correct item is packed, and quantities, markings, and associated paperwork are
          correct. These individuals will inspect contents of packages when discrepancies are
          found or there is evidence of tampering.
          4.2.1.2.2. Completing the AF Form 4387 is mandatory for all individuals packing
          and verifying NWRM being shipped by the traffic management activity.
          4.2.1.2.3. Individuals initiating packing of NWRM will initiate the AF Form 4387
          and complete Section I prior to presenting the NWRM for shipment.
       4.2.1.3. Ensure two individuals participate in packing NWRM and filling out related
       documents. One individual performs the packing while the second individual performs
       the verification of the packing outlined in paragraph 4.2.
       4.2.1.4. Ensure DD Form 1500 series condition tags are completed for each individual
       NWRM regardless of condition code.
          4.2.1.4.1. When NWRM is packed or repacked, new DD Form 1500 series condition
          tags must be completed by a certified inspector/technical specialist performing the
AFI20-110_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                            31


         packing. Opening the container to retrieve documents does not require completion of
         new DD Form 1500 series condition tags.
         4.2.1.4.2. Individuals identified in paragraph 2.15.5 will sign DD Form 1500 series
         condition code tags.
     4.2.1.5. Ensure NWRM identification, marking and packaging is IAW AFI 24-203,
     Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo and AFMAN 23-110. Personnel will
     utilize the applicable technical order to positively identify NWRM and complete required
     documentation (DD Form 1500 series tag, AF Form 4387, AF Form 2005, AFTO Form
     350, etc.). Discrepancies between technical order and asset markings will be identified to
     the AFGLSC/NTCC for resolution.
  4.2.2. All passive RFID labels placed on NWRM shipping/packaging containers must be
  rendered inoperative by slicing through the embedded antennae and the tag and spray paint
  over once the asset in the container is removed.
  4.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Intra-base NWRM movements (i.e. Maintenance to NWRM Storage
  Facilities/LRS) will not be "final" packaged for shipment (with the exception of NWRM
  assets required to be packaged by a maintenance technician/mechanic per the
  TO/SH252/Special Packaging Instruction [SPI]). When final packaging is performed by
  depot maintenance personnel, NWRM Storage Facility personnel may be present to verify
  items during packaging to ensure two-person visual verification.
     4.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) The movement of NWRM assets between facilities located on
     the same base will follow movement packaging and protective requirements. If the SPI or
     TO are insufficient, submit a maintenance request IAW TO 00-25-107 or AFTO Form
     202 if required.
     4.2.3.2. (Added-AFMC) All ALC movements between work centers and between MX
     and AFGLSC personnel, prior to pick-up by the NWRM Storage Facility personnel will
     have the change of custody documented on a DD Form 1907, Signature and Tally
     Record. Once inducted into the NWRM Storage Facility, the NWRM Storage Facility
     will keep the DD Form1907 on file.
4.3. (Added-AFMC) Unique Marking of NWRM:
  4.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Prior to the unique marking of NWRM, the program office will
  designate a single marking-official for coordinating and managing the marking of the assets.
  This single POC may either be an ES or engineer. When IUID engineering analysis
  determines the asset can be marked by utilizing standard approved tape labels, the single
  POC will be contacted to place the IUID label on the asset during the bare item inspection
  process performed in induction.
  4.3.2. (Added-AFMC) Prior to unpacking NWRM, the marking-official will verify if a
  Special Handling 252, Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO), or TO exists and it fully
  documents the IUID marking procedures. If the procedures specify marking that can be
  accomplished within the NSF (I.E. pre-printed polyacrylic labels or equivalent) then IUID
  marking should be accomplished during asset induction. Either the marking official, ES, or a
  designated maintenance technician will affix the IUID label IAW TO guidance.
32                                                  AFI20-110_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012


  4.3.3. (Added-AFMC) The following will be accomplished for AIT tagging of serialized
  and non-serialized assets during induction within the NSF. Storage facility personnel (or
  AFMC maintenance personnel) will remove the asset from packaging and obtain legacy asset
  information from existing data plates, labels, or markings. NSF personnel will input legacy
  pedigree asset information (CAGE Code, P/N, and NSN) in the corresponding data fields
  within the PIC Automated Data Capture (ADC) application. For non-serialized assets NSF
  personnel will then attach a temporary serialized tag to the asset with a harness or lanyard.
  Personnel will manually enter serialized data within the PIC ADC S/N data field. The PIC
  ADC requires that personnel enter the serial number twice for positive verification. Once
  entered, the PIC ADC requires supervisor‗s verification for end of day close-out. If the asset
  possesses the appropriate IUID technical marking documentation, the IUID label will be
  applied by the marking official, ES, or maintenance personnel IAW applicable TO data.
  Once the label is affixed, the IUID label will be scanned into the PIC ADC IUID field. If
  IUID engineering marking approval does not currently exist, leave the IUID field blank
  within the PIC ADC. The asset will then be returned to its original packaging and personnel
  will apply two identical passive RFID (pRFID) tags on adjacent sides of the assets container.
  Tags will not be placed on top or bottom of the container. Personnel will then populate the
  pRFID field within the PIC ADC by reading the passive tags.
  4.3.4. (Added-AFMC) Non-serialized NWRM shall require additional actions beyond the
  tasks described above. For these items, storage facility personnel (or AFMC maintenance
  personnel) will remove the temporary serialized tag. NSF personnel will erase the S/N data
  field information within the PIC ADC.
  4.3.5. (Added-AFMC) Alternative Marking Method: When IUID engineering analysis
  determines the asset cannot be marked by utilizing standard polyacrylic tape labels;
  alternative marking procedures will be utilized. Alternative marking method in Engineering
  Change Order (ECO)/TO/TCTO will dictate the exact marking method to be utilized. These
  marking exceptions should be handled on a case-by-case basis through the SNT/IUID Project
  Management Office and the local IUID program leads. The SNT/IUID office will assess
  available marking resources and provide asset disposition.

      condition tag and outer container markings with data shown on the shipping document.
         6.7.2.1.1. NWRM will not be inspected for the sole purpose of S/N verification. If
         there is evidence of tampering personnel identified in paragraph 2.15.5 will be used to
         inspect/verify the contents of the package. Note: The container will have to be
         opened to retrieve the shipping document and the DD Form 1500 series condition tag.
         6.7.2.1.2. Shipments received from organizations outside of the AF or DOE will be
         opened, except for items requiring specialized handling, to inspect the internal
         contents, packaging, and data plate to validate S/Ns and verify compliance with SPIs.
         6.7.2.1.3. NWRM received that require specialized handling will be documented as
         not having been inspected and will be scheduled for inspection within 30 days of
         receipt.
      6.7.2.2. In the event of a discrepancy, complete a Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR)
      IAW AFMAN 23-110 Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 10B-8. All discrepancies must also be
      evaluated IAW criteria in Chapter 11 for NWRM discrepancy reporting.
         6.7.2.2.1. The SDR is filed by receiving activities through the DoD WebSDR system
         to record item or packaging discrepancies attributable to the responsibility of the
         shipper (including government sources, contractors/manufacturers or vendors), and to
         aid in inventory accounting. When the WebSDR is completed, the filing activity will
         notify the shipper by email or phone that an SDR has been filed on the shipment.
         6.7.2.2.2. The SF Form 364, Report of Discrepancy, paper form, can be used until
         access to the DoD WebSDR system is established IAW AFJMAN 23-215, Reporting
         of Supply Discrepancies, DoD 4000.25-M, Military Standard Transaction Reporting
         and Accounting Procedures (MILSTRAP), Volume 2, Chapter 17.

                                         Chapter 7

       DEPOT/FIELD/CONTRACTOR LEVEL MAINTENANCE PROCESSING

7.1. Tracking.
   7.1.1. Ensure S/N tracking and accountability is maintained for all NWRM through the
   entire maintenance process from the time it is accepted from supply/stock until it is either
   expended in-use or returned to supply/stock.
      7.1.1.1. NWRM disassembled or removed during the maintenance process are not
      required to be picked up on the supply accountable record when the item is intended to be
      reassembled or installed during the same maintenance action (e.g. 24-month inspection,
      reentry system recycle, depot overhaul, etc.). Local procedures/operating instructions
      will be developed to ensure S/N tracking and accountability is maintained throughout the
      maintenance process.
      7.1.1.2. Maintenance processing for CAS-managed NWRM will be IAW AFI 21-201.
      S/N tracking and accountability for CAS-managed NWRM in maintenance will be done
      on CAS stock record account throughout the entire maintenance process. Use DIFM
      issue procedures in AFI 21-201 for munitions NWRM that are issued to replace installed
      components.
      7.1.1.3. Use SPRAM/Equipment account to maintain accountability of NWRM as
      described in paragraph 2.15.7.
   7.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Work orders for field and Work Control Documents (WCDs) (and
   TO-00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance Request in Software Maintenance Group) for depot
   involving NWRM will be clearly distinguished from other work orders/WCDs by
   electronically annotating, printing or stamping in red, ―NWRM, at the top of the document
   (or in specially designated electronic field/block where electronically available).
      7.1.2.1. (Added-AFMC) S/Ns of embedded NWRM assets will be recorded on their
      own ―child‖ WCD if work is going to be performed on the embedded NWRM asset.
      Work on embedded NWRM asset will not be performed under a ―parent‖ WCD of the
      Next Higher Assembly (NHA).
   7.1.3. (Added-AFMC) NWRM S/N tracking and reporting into REMIS is required for all
   maintenance workloads, to include all depot maintenance workloads, except where otherwise
   directed y applicable AFI 21-200 seeries guidance. The NHA into which an NWRM item is
   installed must also be reported/input into REMIS. The AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical
   Data will be used.
   7.1.4. (Added-AFMC) When receiving aircraft, normal inventory will be completed. In
   addition, aircraft will be inspected to verify NWRM items as installed/uninstalled and to
   verify NWRM items that should have been removed IAW with technical data prior to arrival
   were in fact removed. If such NWRM items are discovered, immediately notify the RO. The
   RO will take action to coordinate with the AO, IM and NTCC to determine if NWRM found
   in DoD control on incoming aircraft is approapriately accounted for IAW with instruction.
   NTCC will determine if an NWRM incident has occurred and coordinate on final disposition
   of NWRM asset. If NWRM is to be turned in as FOB the RO will coordinate with the AO,
 40                                                AFI20-110_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012


   IM and LRS for the turn in of the items to an authorized NWRM storage facility. If aircraft
   forms/records do not reflect the correct NWRM status, the NTCC will notify the home
   station NWRMAO and IM of the discrepancy. The home station NWRMAO will ensure
   correction of the aircraft forms/records.
   7.1.5. (Added-AFMC) Maintenance Holding Areas: If NWRM is not part of a maintenance
   action, but must be removed/uninstalled to perform the maintenance action; the item will be
   placed in a holding area (i.e. Tail number bins (TNB) and Facilitate Other Maintenance
   (FOM) areas, or NWRM holding area). All NWRM placed in TNB or FOM must be
   identified on the TNB or FOM inventory list.
7.2. Items No Longer Required.
   7.2.1. Any NWRM not subsequently reinstalled or reassembled in the same maintenance
   action will be picked up on supply accountable records within 24 hours of disassembly or
   removal.
       7.2.1.1. All disassembled or removed NWRM no longer required will be properly tagged
       to ensure, at a minimum, item identification, S/N tracking, and condition code status.
       Personnel will utilize the applicable technical order to positively identify NWRM and
       complete required documentation (DD Form 1500 series tag, AF Form 4387, AF Form
       2005, AFTO Form 350, etc.). Discrepancies between technical order and asset markings
       will be identified to the IM for resolution.
       7.2.1.2. Unserviceable NWRM will be promptly marked with the correct condition and
       will not be co-mingled with serviceable items or other unserviceable items of another
       condition.
7.3. Documentation. For NWRM in a maintenance/install status, ensure internal tracking, work
control documents; build up sheets, and configuration records reflect the fact that an NWRM is
involved. Completed documents/records should reflect the involved S/N of the NWRM and be
reported IAW 00-20-series Technical Orders and AFI 21-XXX series instructions. When
NWRM higher level assemblies are disassembled ensure that the S/Ns of embedded NWRM
undergoing a maintenance action are recorded on the Work Control Document (WCD)/Work
Order and in the appropriate AF Maintenance Information Systems (MIS) and/or the approved
AFMC depot maintenance system for depot maintenance actions.
7.4. Cannibalization. Notify the IM of all NWRM cannibalization actions and update the
appropriate management system(s).
7.4. (AFMC)All cannibalization actions of NWRM assets will be documented at field level,
in MISTR shops, or contractor facilities with an appropriate work order, or a WCD in
addition to the AFMC Form 206, Temporary Work Request at depot level.
7.5. (Added-AFMC) Depot Maintenance:
   7.5.1. (Added-AFMC) Since Depot Software Maintenance Group (SMXG) organizations
   do not use WCDs, a TO 00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance, engineering disposition
   instructions or a statement of work/task order will be used to record NWRM S/Ns. SMXG
   will notify the RO of all actions involving an NWRM item via e-mail if a AFMC Form 107,
   Engineering Technical Assistance Requests is not applicable.
AFI20-110_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                              41


   7.5.2. (Added-AFMC) When an unserviceable NWRM item is removed from a higher
   assembly, and there are no serviceable assets in supply, the unserviceable NWRM item may
   be processed as a job route. Job routes must be approved by the IM, documented on a child
   WCD, with parent-child relationships maintained and supply records must be updated IAW
   with AFMCI 21-129. Notify the MXW RO when the approval has been received and the item
   is ready to be routed to the repair shop. Prior approval is required to ensure appropriate
   funding is allocated and systems transactions are completed before work begins.
   7.5.3. (Added-AFMC) All removed or installed NWRM S/Ns and associated data will be
   input into appropriate databases/systems by end of next duty day after completion of
   maintenance action.
   7.5.4. (Added-AFMC) Receiving Assets from NWRM Storage Facility: When receiving
   assets from the NWRM Storage Facility verify DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt
   Document, and DD Form 1907 are properly annotated. Also, verify S/N(s) on documents
   match S/N(s) on the asset. If S/N(s) do not match or documentation is incomplete or
   inaccurate, do not accept the NWRM and return materiel to NWRM Storage Facility. If it
   requires a technician to open the container, Depot maintenance will induct the asset, open the
   container and verify the S/N. If the S/N does not match the documentation, the asset will be
   turned-in by processing a DF1 and a D6 transaction, annotate the S/N received and return the
   asset to the NWRM Storage Facility.
      7.5.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Depot maintenance will induct all received NWRM assets
      within 24 hours.
   7.5.5. (Added-AFMC) NWRM in Awaiting Parts (AWP) status will be physically
   controlled by depot maintenance wing personnel.
   7.5.6. (Added-AFMC) NWRM assets to include repair end items and Government
   Furnished Property (GFP) at CDM contractor repair facilities will be managed in CAV-AF in
   accordance with (IAW) AFMCI 21-149, Contract Depot Maintenance. NWRM assets being
   managed on a contract other than EZ DODAAC repair will be managed in CAV-AF IAW
   CAV-AF, Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM) Non-Repair/Refurbishment
   Contractor Users Guide, maintained by AFMC/A4UA and is available at:
   https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/HQAFMCA4/Nuclearsustainment/CAV%20AF%20NW
   RM/Forms/AllItems.aspx. The CAV-AF System Administrator for non-EZ DODAAC
   contracts is located in HQ AFMC/A4U.
7.6. (Added-AFMC) Turn-In by Depot Maintenance:
   7.6.1. (Added-AFMC) Depot maintenance technicians/mechanics will perform final
   packaging for all NWRM assets requiring special procedures as directed by the applicable
   maintenance TO/SH252 (Special Handling AFMC IMT 252). Note: NWRM Storage Facility
   personnel will be present to visually verify items being final packaged by maintenance
   personnel.
   7.6.2. (Added-AFMC) Depot maintenance will place NWRM items not requiring TO
   directed special packing in Special Packaging Instruction (SPI) containers for final pack by

                              INVENTORIES AND AUDITS

8.1. Inventories: Inventories must be performed on all NWRM to ensure asset balances are
accurately reflected on accounts.
   8.1.1. Inventory Requirements.
      8.1.1.1. A complete physical inventory count of NWRM by S/N and/or UII will be
      conducted semiannually IAW the procedures in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1,
      Chapter 6. All NWRM on supply accountable records must be inventoried.
          8.1.1.1.1. Aircraft/Weapons/Missiles that contain NWRM installed assets on supply
          accountable records will not be grounded for the purpose of conducting an inventory.
          In this case, records checks will be performed to validate the installed asset by S/N
          and/or UII and reported to account for these items.
          8.1.1.1.2. All NWRM end items/Line Replacement Unit (LRU) on accountable
          records (e.g. mock-ups, trainers, those LRUs used in a testing and/or maintenance
          environment, and spare LRUs) requiring disassembly or where disassembly prevents
          the operation of the end item will not be physically counted during this inventory. In
          this case, records checks will be performed to validate these assets by S/N and/or UII
          and reported to account for these items.
          8.1.1.1.3. Installed NWRM not on supply accountable records are not subject to this
          NWRM inventory requirement.
          8.1.1.1.4. For NWRM managed in CAS, the inventory and audit procedures in this
          Instruction are in addition to requirements in AFI 21-201.
          8.1.1.1.5. NWRM issued on an AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, must be
          physically inventoried and matched to the item record. The AF IMT 1297 will not be
          used for asset verification during the inventory.
          8.1.1.1.6. NWRM accounted for as installed but disassembled as part of an on-going
          maintenance action IAW Chapter 7 are subject to inventory.
      8.1.1.2. The semiannual inventory requires a visual verification of NWRM by both the
      inventory officer and the verifying officer. Banded, crated, and/or sealed assets showing
      no signs of tampering will not be opened for inventory purposes. Obtain component
      S/N/UII from the exterior packaging/tag (DD Form 1500 series), to include any leading
      alpha character and zeros. When a container must be opened, qualified personnel
      identified in paragraph 2.15.5 will inspect NWRM property to verify the identity,
      quantity, and S/Ns.
      8.1.1.3. The NWRMAO will execute the semiannual inventory IAW the procedures in
      AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 6. The MASO will conduct the inventory
      and audit for NWRM managed in CAS IAW requirements in this Instruction in addition
      to requirements in AFI 21-201.
      8.1.1.4. Change of NWRMAO or MASO.

        8.1.1.4.1. Each time a new NWRMAO is assigned, the gaining and losing
        NWRMAO must conduct a complete inventory of NWRM within the stock record
        account IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 6.
        8.1.1.4.2. Each time a new MASO is assigned, the gaining and losing MASO must
        conduct a complete inventory of NWRM managed in CAS IAW procedures in AFI
        21-201.
     8.1.1.5. Change of Equipment/SPRAM Custodian. Each time a new Equipment/SPRAM
     custodian is assigned, the gaining custodian must conduct a complete inventory of items
     issued to his/her equipment account, IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter
     22. Report any unresolved discrepancies to the NWRMAO and the appropriate
     commander to initiate a Report of Survey (or other appropriate action) prior to signing
     the Custody Receipt listing and assuming responsibility for the account.
     8.1.1.6. Units that conduct nuclear weapons Semiannual Inventory Report (SIR) IAW TP
     100-3150, Joint Reporting Structure; Nuclear Weapons Reports, the NWRM inventory
     will take place at the same time. This includes all units on the base that possess NWRM,
     to include the LRSs that support geographically separated units.
        8.1.1.6.1. Units that do not conduct a SIR IAW TP 100-3150 will conduct the
        NWRM inventory in the months of March and September.
        8.1.1.6.2. The inventory month may be adjusted for valid nuclear surety criteria. To
        request a waiver to change the inventory month, submit a request through your
        appropriate chain of command to AFMC/A4. Waiver requests must state the impact
        on the unit or supporting rationale and will be submitted NLT 45 calendar days prior
        to the scheduled inventory start date. Requests to change a unit‘s SIR month must be
        processed IAW AFI 21-203.
        8.1.1.6.3. Units conducting the NWRM inventory in conjunction with the nuclear
        weapons SIR will not conduct a separate inventory in March or September. These
        units will use the results from the inventory conducted during the SIR to satisfy the
        NWRM inventory requirement.
     8.1.1.7. Reportable discrepancies found during the NWRM semiannual inventories will
     be reported IAW criteria in Chapter 11 for NWRM discrepancy reporting.
  8.1.2. Inventory Documentation.
     8.1.2.1. The NWRMAO or MASO will ensure that the following documents relevant to
     inventories are maintained IAW AFMAN 33-363, and disposed of IAW the AF RDS in
     AFRIMS:
        8.1.2.1.1. Certificate of Inventory or the CAS Inventory Complete Report (AM427A)
        8.1.2.1.2. Inventory and Verifying Individual appointment letter.
        8.1.2.1.3. Inventory count cards and worksheets, or the CAS Inventory Count Listing
        (AM427G).

AFI20-110_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                                 45


   8.1.3. AFMC will manage the reporting process to ensure MAJCOM NWRM inventory
   results are consolidated and reported to AF/A4L IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1,
   Chapter 6.
8.2. Audit Trails.
   8.2.1. While a specific audit trail for each transaction varies by transaction type, there are
   general requirements that constitute an adequate audit trail. The audit trail begins with letters
   of authorization. These letters, signed by appropriate approving officials, IAW governing
   directives, provide the authorization for individuals to request and or receipt for property,
   report or process accountable transactions to the NWRMAO or MASO or his/her
   representatives, and maintain or process account records on his/her behalf and subject to
   his/her validation. The audit trail continues with paper or electronically filed source
   documents (e.g. receipt, shipping, issue, and turn-in documents, inventory adjustment
   documents, etc.) supporting the transactions. These documents are controlled through the
   use of document registers, control logs, or electronic management, and are numbered
   sequentially or titled IAW standard formats so that the documents are traceable, and it is easy
   to determine when they are missing. The audit trail includes proper preparation of these
   documents using approved procedures and signatures (when required) of approved
   individuals. Account stock records then tie the supporting documents to changes in account
   balances reflected on individual lines of the stock records. The audit trail continues with
   periodic inventories that demonstrate the accuracy of account balances compared to physical
   identification and counts of property. The audit trail also includes certificates of transfer of
   accountability.
   8.2.2. Semiannual or other directed audits provide an independent assessment of account
   records to ensure proper accountability is maintained, an accurate audit trail exists, and
   proper accounting procedures are being followed. Audits are performed either by an outside
   agency or by a disinterested individual. The audit consists of reviewing a representative
   sample of accounting and transaction records to determine if approved accounting procedures
   are adequate and are being followed, and to assess the accuracy of accountable records and
   completeness of the audit trail. If inaccuracies or irregularities are discovered, the sample is
   increased to determine the extent of the inaccuracy or irregularity. In general, an audit
   provides assurance that:
       8.2.2.1. Accountable officers have been duly appointed and meet qualifications required
       by pertinent directives.
       8.2.2.2. Certificates of transfer of accountability indicate an unbroken chain of
       accountability between accountable individuals.
       8.2.2.3. Proper periodic inventories are being conducted as required and stock records
       reflect accurate balances as of the latest 100-percent inventory.
       8.2.2.4. Personnel properly authorized to maintain the account are posting transactions to
       account records as transactions occur, and that personnel are knowledgeable of required
       procedures.
       8.2.2.5. Required reports are submitted IAW directive timelines.
 46                                                   AFI20-110_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012


       8.2.2.6. Transactions posted to accountable records are adequately supported by source
       documents that are properly prepared and only properly supported transactions are posted
       to account records.
       8.2.2.7. All original accountable documents are properly filed/maintained as determined
       by a review of document registers, document control logs, and files.
       8.2.2.8. Personnel who receive property are authorized to do so IAW appropriate
       guidance/procedures.
       8.2.2.9. An adequate audit trail exists indicating approved accounting procedures are
       followed.
       8.2.2.10. Air Force, higher headquarters, and local NWRM management guidance is
       effective in meeting PIC requirements.       Auditors will recommend changes to
       management policies through appropriate channels.
8.3. Audits of Accounts. The term "audited" as it applies to these procedures denotes a formal
quantitative audit of a specific account (i.e. DODAAC) for the purpose of verifying its records.
   8.3.1. Types of audits.
       8.3.1.1. Semiannual audit. This audit of account is accomplished in conjunction with the
       NWRM inventory. The verifying individual, appointed by the accountable officer‘s
       appointing official, is the audit officer and will perform this audit in conjunction with
       each NWRM inventory.
       8.3.1.2. Special audits. In addition to the semiannual audit of account, the Air Force
       Audit Agency, higher headquarters, or a government agency, such as the Government
       Accountability Office (GAO), may direct a special audit. For special audits, the agency
       directing the audit determines its scope.
   8.3.2. Appointing the audit officer. The accountable officer‘s appointing authority will
   designate a verifying individual in writing IAW paragraphs 2.12.4 or 2.13.4.
   8.3.3. Briefing the audit officer. The NWRMAO or MASO brief the audit officer, who
   conducts the audit IAW procedures in this document, using the checklist in Attachment 3 as a
   guide. Prior to the start of the audit, the NWRMAO or MASO reviews the checklist with the
   audit officer, provides examples of documents to illustrate items shown in the checklist, and
   answers any questions the audit officer may have concerning the requirements of the audit.
   8.3.4. Performing the audit. The audit officer must:
       8.3.4.1. Review the previous audit report. During the audit, place special emphasis on
       ensuring that all previously noted discrepancies were corrected.
       8.3.4.2. Review document registers/transaction histories and inventory all documents
       created since the last audit to ensure all documents are on file. For forced receipts, ensure
       the shipper‘s document number is cross-referenced in the Remarks column of the
       register. Ensure all documents on file are either original documents (paper or electronic)
       or certified true copies of original documents.
       8.3.4.3. Review a 10-percent representative sample of all shipping, receipt, issue, and
       turn-in documents since the last audit for all NWRM. Ensure documents were properly
AFI20-110_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                             47


     prepared and only authorized personnel signed for the items on the documents. Ensure
     NWRM S/Ns are posted on all documents. If the reviewer deems it necessary, or when

         DEMILITARIZATION, EXPENDITURE, AND DISPOSAL OF NWRM

10.1 General.
   10.1.1. All NWRM declared excess to Air Force requirements will be demilitarized,
   destroyed, or disposed of IAW DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual and
   applicable guidance in AFMAN 23-110. DOE-designed items will be demilitarized and
   disposed of IAW TP 100-1. Demilitarization and disposal of NWRM is required within two
   years of excess/condemned determination. Movement of materiel for demilitarization will be
   in accordance with the approved AF Demilitarization Plan or as directed by the item
   manager.
   10.1.2. Disposal of NWRM also applies to NWRM expended or destroyed in test and
   evaluation programs.       Documentation would be the same as below to show
   destruction/expenditure and provided to the IM to be processed off the AF record. The IM
   will provide NWRMAOs direction to remove NWRM from base-level accountable records.
10.2. Demilitarization Codes.
   10.2.1. All NWRM will be assigned demilitarization codes G, P, or F. Demil Code G
   (applies to ammunition, explosive and dangerous articles), and Demil Code P (applies to
   classified articles) must be demilitarized prior to transfer to Defense Reutilization and
   Marketing Service (DRMS).
   10.2.2. Demil Code F will be assigned to all NWRM meeting the DOD Demil Code A-D, or
   Q definitions. Demilitarization instructions for Demil Code F assets are furnished by the IM
   and may only be transferred to the DRMS for demilitarization with strict compliance to the
   procedures listed in this chapter.
10.3. NWRM             Demilitarization           Instructions. NWRM            may           be
demilitarized/destroyed/expended by various agencies: Air Force organic maintenance or
contractor, or DRMS (for items with Demil Code F). Completion of a DRMS Form 145,
Demilitarization Certificate, is required, by S/N, for all destroyed or expended NWRM
demilitarized. This requires two signatures (certifier and verifier). When a built up asset (one
that has numerous NSNs) is destroyed/expended, the DRMS Form 145 must include all NWRM
NSNs and the S/Ns that were destroyed/expended as part of the action taken on the built up asset.
   10.3.1. For NWRM destroyed by DRMS. The certifier will be an AFMC-appointed (Air
   Force, DCMA, NNSA) individual trained to certify NWRM demilitarization/destruction/
   expenditure. DRMS will verify the demilitarization and will post the DRMS Form 145 on
   WEBDOCs.
   10.3.2. For NWRM demilitarized and destroyed/expended by AF maintenance personnel,
   different individuals within the maintenance organization must certify and verify the action.
   The completed DRMS Form 145 will be turned over to the IM if there is no scrap or to
   DRMS and the IM if there is scrap.
   10.3.2. (AFMC) All assets sent to organic maintenance for DEMIL will be accompanied
   with detailed DEMIL instructions in the special instruction field of an AFMC Form 206. If
AFI20-110_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                            51


  destruction procedures in the commodity T.O. are not sufficient, contact the program office
  via an AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request and Reply. NWRM
  under a DEMIL action performed by depot maintenance will have S/Ns documented on
  WCDs. Work must be performed via a WCD, cannot be performed solely using the AF
  Form 206 request package. After DEMIL actions have been completed, they will be reported
  into REMIS by the end of the next duty day. If there is residual material after completion of
  NWRM DEMIL, maintenance will turn in the material to DLA-DS as DEMIL code ―B ―
  scrap with the weight annotated on a DD-Form 1348-1A. A copy of the DEMIL certificate
  will be provided to the IM NLT 24 hours after DEMIL.
  10.3.3. For NWRM demilitarized/destroyed/expended by other services or by contractors
  will be witnessed and certified by an Air Force, DCMA or NNSA representative. The
  certifier will be responsible for completing the DRMS Form 145 and forwarding it to the IM
  upon demilitarization/ destruction/expenditure completion. The other services or contractor
  representative will sign as the verifier.
  10.3.3. (AFMC) DEMIL by other Services/Agencies: Prior to transfer of ownership to
  another Service/Agency for DEMIL, the IM/ES team must ensure detailed DEMIL and
  destruction procedures are forwarded with the asset(s).
  10.3.4. (Added-AFMC) The IM, in coordination with the cognizant ES and Engineer, is
  responsible for providing specific demilitarization instructions for NWRM assets sent to
  Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG). DEMIL will be in compliance
  with AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting,
  and Termination. The PM must provide technical procedures on how to DEMIL the assets,
  which should have been obtained as part of the weapon systems sustainment and eventual
  deactivation/disposal activities.
     10.3.4.1. (Added-AFMC) For aircraft stored at AMARG, the following will be
     performed to determine if any NWRM assets are installed:
         10.3.4.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Aircraft in storage project codes ―XS (Inviolate) or
         ―XT (Foreign Military Sales (FMS)/SAF Hold) do not require NWRM inspection.
         Inspection will be performed only when one of the following actions is required: Re-
         preservation, Withdrawal, Regeneration or Disposal. These aircraft are fully
         preserved for desert storage and will only have removals performed when directed by
         HAF.
         10.3.4.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Aircraft in storage project codes ―XV (Potential
         Reclamation) and ―XX (Excess) have the potential to be parts donors through
         Reclamation. All part-removal requests must be submitted through the AMARG
         Form 44 system or through a ―Save-List. In addition, all parts removed are entered
         into MAXIMO which have been programmed to identify NWRM requests and keys
         on NSNs listed in the master list.
         10.3.4.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Aircraft in storage project codes ―XV and ―XX
         deemed to have been NWRM parts-capable, will not be inspected based upon the
         above accountable procedures. As disposition of mission design series transpire,
         potentially stored NWRM items will be documented and accounted for IAW AFI 20-
         110 Chapter 5.

   10.3.5. (Added-AFMC) The IM will place the DRMS Form 145, Demilitarization
   Certificate in the NSN folder and upload a copy into PIC Fusion supporting documentation
   file.
10.4. Demilitarization of Demil Code F NWRM.
   10.4.1. NWRM Demil F items will be shredded. The IM must verify with the engineer or
   ES that these items have no constituent hazards which would result from shredding.
   10.4.2. For NWRM with a Demil Code of F, the below instructions (Figure 10.1) will be
   posted on the AEPS website: https://aeps2.ria.army.mil by the IM and utilized by DRMS.
   These instructions only apply to DRMS:

Figure 10.1. NWRM Instructions.
             ―This asset is Nuclear Weapon Related Material (NWRM). It will be retained
             in Air Force custody until it is sent to DRMS for demilitarization per the
             approved DLA/AF/DTRA MOA. Serial numbers for all NWRM assets must
             be recorded on or attached to DD Form 1348-1A, Disposal Turn in
             Documents (DTIDs). Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS)
             will not reutilize, transfer, donate or sell NWRM assets. NWRM assets will
             be shipped directly to the Tucson DRMS Central Demilitarization Center
             (CDC) after coordination with the Demilitarization Center and
             AFNWC/AFGLSC. Air Force personnel will witness and certify the
             demilitarization of all NWRM assets.‖
10.5. Demilitarization of Demil Coded P and G NWRM.
   10.5.1. All assets must be rendered safe, declassified, demilitarized, and destroyed IAW
   AFMAN 23-110, Volume 6, Chapter 7.
   10.5.2. Scrap material from the completely demilitarized assets will be transferred to DRMS.
   10.5.3. Scrap material generated as the result of NWRM demilitarization will be transferred
   only to DRMS, not to a Base Resource Recycling and Recovery Program (RRRP). When
   NWRM scrap is turned into DRMS, a DD 1348-1A with the original Demil Code annotated
   on it, and the completed DRMS Form 145 must be given to the DRMS. The DRMS Form
   145 will be provided to DRMS for posting on WEBDOCs.
