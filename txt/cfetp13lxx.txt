Part I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training
document that identifies life-cycle qualification, education and training requirements, training support
resources, and minimum requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear
career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field initial training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors plan, manage, and control training within the specialty
using both parts of the plan. All references to “Level 2” certification will not apply until an updated Officer
Classification Directory (OCD) is published. The estimated date for OCD publication is Nov, 2013.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains
how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and
responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty
qualifications (knowledge, education, training, experience and other mandatory requirements); and
Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Course Training Standard (CTS) and Training
References (TRs) to support training, AETC conducted training and correspondence course requirements.
It also includes duties, tasks, and technical references to support initial qualification training (IQT).
Section B identifies training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support
training. Included here are mandatory and optional courses. Section C identifies available support
materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP), which may be developed to support
proficiency training. Section D identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to
determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. At unit level, supervisors
and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training commensurate with overall goals of
this plan.

3. Using guidance provided in this CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and
efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan enables us to train today’s force for
tomorrow’s capabilities.

Section A – General Information

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field Managers
(AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors and
trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program. The
plan outlines the training individuals in this Air Force Specialty (AFS) should receive in order to develop
and progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills and some follow-on training courses.
Initial qualification is the AFS specific training an officer requires for entry into the Air Force or upon
retraining into this specialty for award of the 1-skill level, and prior to the award of the 3- skill level. Some
of this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers and some will be conducted at
USAF Air Combat Command and US Army bases. It is designed to provide the performance
skills/knowledge required to do the job. Follow-on/Advanced training is formal specialty training for
selected officers on an as-available basis. This CFETP has several purposes, to include but not limited to:

2. CFETP Utilization. The plan will be used by MFMs, commanders and supervisors at all levels to
ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop and revise formal resident, nonresident, field and exportable
training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.
They will also work with the Career Field Manager (CFM) to develop acquisition strategies for
obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.

2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade
and proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training and contract training or exportable course can
satisfy identified requirements. MAJCOM- developed training, to support this AFSC, must be
identified for inclusion in this plan.

2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The lists
of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

3. Coordination and Approval. AF/A3O is the approval authority. Also, the AFCFM will initiate an
annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM representatives and AETC
training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements. Using the list of
courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

Section B – Career Field Progression and Information

4. Specialty Description. The Air Liaison Officer (ALO) specialty (13LXX) is the senior Tactical Air
Control Party member who functions as the primary advisor to the ground commander on Airpower. This
specialty conducts strategic, operational and tactical level planning, and provides battle staff expertise,
advocacy, liaison, and offensive air support C2 operations and employment in the conduct of combat
operations.

4.1. Specialty Summary. The ALO leads, plans, organizes, and supervises day-to-day Tactical Air
Control Party (TACP) and Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) operations and personnel both in
garrison and while deployed. The ALO represents the Joint/Combined Forces Air Component
Commander as a supporting member of the Army Commander’s staff at the Battalion through Corps
echelons in a coalition, joint, or interagency force. The ALO provides subject matter expertise to lead,
plan, and execute Command-and-Control and terminal control of Air, Space, and Cyber operations in
direct support of land component forces from Battalion through Corps, or as required, as part of a
coalition, joint, or interagency force. The ALO may engage enemy forces utilizing advanced
technologies and weapon systems to direct lethal and non-lethal fires and effects in close proximity to
friendly forces as a Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC).

Note: The initial skills training in this CFETP is designed to create a mission qualified ALO. The new
13L will require oversight and development by senior ALOs and other Liaison Officers (LNO) as they
develop their Airpower expertise and function as Air Liaison Officers. At some point, as determined by
the unit commander, the 13L ALO will become ready for increased responsibility, authority, and
autonomous operations in various positions of the Battalion through Corps TACP and ASOC.

4.2. Leads, plans, and organizes TACP and ASOC operations. Advises and educates ground
commanders on all aspects of air, space, and cyber power and integration of air, space, and cyber assets
into the ground scheme of maneuver. Plans, processes, requests and conducts infiltration, surface
movement, and ex-filtration functions with ground maneuver forces of operations that include air, space
and cyber resources. Performs specified small unit tactics, mounted and dismounted navigation, and
operates tactical combat vehicles in austere field conditions and environments.

4.2.1. Additional Responsibilities. Plans, coordinates, and conducts joint fires to include close air support
(CAS), air interdiction (AI), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), and
suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD). Oversees integration and effects of
electronic warfare (EW) missions. Provides command and control and de-confliction of air and space
assets directly supporting land component combat maneuver units. Synchronizes Air, Space, and Cyber
operations with Army maneuver/Fires through the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP), or other
planning processes, to deliver and integrate lethal and non-lethal fires to enable joint and maneuver
commanders to dominate their operational environment across the spectrum of conflict. Engages enemy
forces utilizing advanced technologies and weapon systems to direct lethal and non-lethal fires and effects
in close proximity to friendly forces. Employs visual and electronic marking equipment to direct airborne
assets to desired targets or area of interest. If JTAC qualified, issues weapons release clearance during
terminal attack control operations.

4.3. Instructions for 13L candidates can be found at the ACC/A3FC Portal Page:

                                                     7
4.3.1. 13L Candidate selection is accomplished differently based on the applicant’s military status. The
selection process is defined by three candidate groups:

4.3.1.1. Current Active Duty Applicants. Active duty officers will apply via the Phase I process (see
paragraph 4.3.2.1.). Upon Phase I selection, candidates will then attend the Phase II ALO Aptitude
Assessment (see paragraph 4.3.2.3.). Active duty enlisted applicants must first apply and be accepted
to attend Officer Training School (OTS). Once the applicant has secured an OTS slot, the applicant
may then apply for Phase I (see paragraph 4.3.2.1.). The enlisted member’s Phase I package must
include their anticipated class start and graduation dates for OTS.

4.3.1.2. AFROTC and USAFA Cadet Applicants. Cadets will be categorized via the non-boarded
AFPC process conducted by AFPC and will normally be categorized during their junior year of college.
AFPC/DPSIP will select the most highly qualified cadets for the 13L AFSC based on criteria defined in
the Air Force Officer Classification Directory. Once selected for 13L AFSC, cadets will attend the
Phase II ALO Aptitude Assessment. Member may attend in either cadet status or upon commissioning.
Attendance in cadet status is the preferred option.

4.3.1.3. OTS Applicants. Prior 1C4, 1C2, 1W0X2, and 1T2, OTS candidates will first apply for the
non-rated OTS board and designate 13L as their choice for AFSC. If selected, applicants will submit a
Phase I package and be reviewed for entry into the AFSC. If not selected for 13L AFSC, OTS
applicants may choose another AFSC or decline OTS. No OTS applicants other than those listed above
will be considered for 13L.

4.3.2. 13L Candidate Selection Process. The 13L candidate selection process consists of two phases for
applicants. The first phase is the Phase I records review. The second phase is the Phase II ALO
Aptitude Assessment (AAA).

4.3.2.1. Active Duty Phase I Selection Procedures. The Phase I consists of applicants submitting an
application package. The format and content of the 13L application package is available on the
ACC/A3FC Portal Page (see para. 4.3.). The Phase I process is conducted periodically, based on
accession requirements/goals, by ACC/A3FC and/or the HAF 13L CFM. The board reviews application
packages and selects the most qualified candidates to attend the Phase II ALO Aptitude Assessment. The
board will select a number of 13L candidates which will ensure enough Phase II graduates to fill current
accession goals (based on historical Phase II attrition rates). The Phase I process for 13L candidates is
executed and funded by ACC/A3FC.

4.3.2.2. Air National Guard (ANG) Selection Procedures. ANG squadron commanders will select 13L
applicants by conducting their own records review and physical fitness assessments. This will constitute




                                                   8
accomplishment of Phase I. ANG candidates will then follow the same training progression beginning with
Phase II as described by paragraph 4.3.2.2. above. NOTE: ANG will provide funding for ANG AAA
candidates.

4.3.2.3. Phase II ALO Aptitude Assessment (AAA). The Phase II AAA is an assessment program that all
ALO applicants (AD, Cadet, ANG) must attend prior to entering 13L Initial Qualification Training (IQT).
The Phase II AAA is a physically and mentally demanding 5-day program designed to select the most
qualified applicants for the career field. More information on the Phase II AAA can be found at the
ACC/A3FC Portal Page (see para. 4.3.). Attendance can be waived by the CFM based on candidate
experience. Note: The Phase II AAA is funded by ACC/A3FC and executed by 93AGOW.

4.4. 13L ALO Initial Qualification Training (IQT). 13L IQT requires attendance at AF/AETC, AF/ACC,
and US Army courses to meet IQT requirements as identified within the CFETP CTS.

4.4.1 After successful selection by the 13L ALO Phase I and II screening process, trainees will be
entered into the 13L ALO IQT training pipeline. (AD retrainees will remain at their Permanent Duty
Station – PDS. New accessions will report to their PDS prior to starting the pipeline.) The desired
order of completion is as follows:

4.4.1.1. ALO Preparatory Course (ALOPC)*, Lackland AFB, TX

4.4.1.2. ALO Basic Course (ALOBC)*, Hurlburt Field, FL

4.4.1.3 Combat Survival (SV-80A), Fairchild AFB, WA

4.4.1.4. Joint Firepower Course (JFC), Nellis AFB, NV

4.4.1.5. ALO Qualification Course (ALOQC), Nellis AFB, NV

4.4.1.6. Joint Fires Observer Course (JFO)*, Fort Sill AIN, OK

Note: TACP Apprentice Course (L3ABP1C431 0T0B) will satisfy ALOBC requirement until the ALOBC
Course is certified and implemented.
Note: Courses may be completed in a different order than above based on scheduling availability, but the
ALOQC must follow the ALOBC and should precede the other courses.
Note: Combat Survival may be completed at any time in the ALO pipeline.
Note: 13L ALOs are required to attend the US Army Airborne Parachutist Course following IQT
completion if their first ALO assignment is to a jump-coded position.

4.4.2 All 13L ALO students will establish membership/connectivity to the following websites during
ALOBC in-processing:

4.4.2.1. Army Knowledge Online (AKO) Account (https://www.us.army.mil)

4.4.2.2. Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) Account (http://jko.jfcom.mil)

4.4.2.3. Log-on to AF Portal (https://www.my.af.mil)

4.4.3. Rated ALO personnel. This CFETP only addresses rated ALO training as it applies to holding a
13L Primary AFSC. It does not apply to rated ALOs with a 13L Duty AFSC.
                                                   9
5. Skill and Career Progression. Adequate training and timely progression from initial qualification
through ALO, Fighter Duty Officer (FDO), Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), instructor,
evaluator, and staff level responsibilities play an important role in the ALO’s ability to accomplish the
Air Force mission. It is essential that everyone involved in training do their part to plan, manage, and

ACC/A3FC – TACP/ASOC SYSTEMS BRANCH website on the AF Portal.

9. Other Qualification Requirements. In addition to the training identified in paragraph 8.5, the following
items are required for award of the AFSC indicated:

9.1. For entry into AFSC 13LX:

9.1.1. Physical qualifications for Ground Based Controller (GBC) and Depth Perception IAW AFI 48-123,
Medical Examinations and Standards for 13LX Air Liaison Officer. GBC physical standards are the
minimum required; rated ALOs will typically hold a Flying Class I Flight Physical which meets all
requirements for GBC. If a rated ALO has been physically disqualified from flying duties, the officer must
meet GBC standards to serve as an ALO.

9.1.2. Successful completion and recommendation from the 13L Phase II ALO AAA.

9.2. For award and retention of 13LX:




                                                    12
9.2.1. Specialty requires routine access to Top Secret/Special Compartmentalized Information (TS/SCI)
or similar environment and completion of a current Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI)
according to AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management.
Note: Award of entry level without a completed SSBI is authorized provided an interim TS/SCI security
clearance has been granted according to AFI 31-501.

9.2.2. Maintain Ground Based Controller and Depth Perception medical standards IAW AFI 48-123,
 Medical Examinations and Standards for 13LX Air Liaison Officer.

9.2.2.1. Maintain Flying Class III Flight Physical standards IAW AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and
Standards for any 13LX Air Liaison Officers assigned to a TACP UTC position requiring Airborne
qualification and currency, or prior to attending Airborne training.

9.2.3. Cross-trainees. Unique requirements for cross-training personnel entering the ALO career field and
award of AFSC 13L3 are as follows:

9.2.3.1. Individuals must enter training prior to their 11th year of Commissioned Service unless waived
by the CFM.

9.2.4. Former enlisted must have performed TACP or JTAC duty within previous five (5) years in order
to enter a modified 13L2 training program (see paragraph 8.3.2.).

9.3. Aeronautical Experience. 13L should be provided opportunities to gain an “air perspective.” TACP
commanders will ensure their ALOs are exposed to air operations when possible (i.e. familiarization flights
with CAS aircraft platforms, academics and cross-talk with rated ALOs, briefing and de-briefing CAS
missions with aircrew when available).

Section D – Resource Constraints

10. Purpose. This section identifies known resource constraints precluding optimal/desired training from
being developed or conducted, including information such as cost and manpower. Narrative explanations
of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training
are included.




                                                    13
11. Entry Level Training:

11.1. Formal School Constraint. ALO Prep and TACP Apprentice courses are constrained courses,
which limits the total number of student entries. Constraints include limited dorm rooms, equipment
and classroom size. Other resource constraints are based on the 13L pipeline training CRE, engagement
with US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), and USAF funding decisions.

11.2. Follow-on School Constraint. Requirements will be fulfilled by unit training until ALO FTU is
funded.

12. Qualification Level Training. All 13LX are required to attend all courses listed in Part II, Section B,
Initial Skills Pipeline Courses, prior to pipeline completion and awarding of the primary AFSC.*

13. Staff Level Training: No constraints exist.

Note: * Refer to paragraph 8.3 Note for rated ALOs.

Section E – Documentation

14. Training records. An individual training and evaluation folder will be maintained for all 13L ALO
personnel.

15. Records Documentation. Documentation is an important part of the training and evaluation
process. Concise and factual documentation provides a history of tasks accomplished and the conditions
under which they were accomplished. Proper documentation supports the trend analysis program, an
important part of the command and unit cross-tell programs. Improper documentation results in an
incomplete picture of the individual’s performance and may hinder the commander/supervisor as they
prepare the individual for career development or re-trains the officer for re-qualification evaluation.

15.1. An individual training and evaluation folder will be opened at the officer’s 13L permanent unit and
will be transferred with the 13L ALO upon each permanent change of assignment. Unless on Temporary
Duty, the Tab 5, Evaluation Record, will be located in the Standards and Evaluations (Stan/Eval) section
for security of evaluation documents. Maintenance responsibility for the folder is shared by Stan/Eval
and training sections per direction in paragraph 16.

16. Training documentation format requirements are described in AFI 36-2201, Air Force
Training Program, paragraph 6.8.

Notes:
- An officer entering the career field directly from an officer commissioning source should anticipate 2 or 3
assignments at the TACP and ASOC squadron level, and the remainder determined by the needs of the career
field and individual career progression/development.
- Cross-trained/Prior Enlisted officers may accomplish applicable training/job portions of this career path,
on an abbreviated timeline, on a case-by-case basis, and in accordance with Commander’s discretion.

PART II

Section A – Course Training Standard (CTS)

1. Implementation (effective 1 October 2012). This CTS will be used for technical training provided
by AETC/ACC. Courses listed in Section B will fulfill 13L ALO initial training requirements until the
implementation of this CFETP.

2. Purpose. The purpose of this CTS is to identify core specialty tasks required by the functional user to
accomplish the mission of an ALO. This CTS describes an ALO in terms of tasks and knowledge which
an individual in this specialty may be expected to perform after initial qualification training, and
identifies the training provided. This CTS serves as a contract between AETC and the functional user to
show which of the overall initial training requirements for the Air Force Specialty Code 13L1 are taught
in formal schools.

3. Documentation.
3.1. Column 1. Task, Knowledge, and Technical References. This column identifies the core tasks
and knowledge necessary for officers to perform duties in the 1, 2, and 3 levels. It also provides
technical references (TR). Task statements are numbered sequentially (i.e. 1.1, 1.2, and 2.1.)

3.2. Column 2. Initial skills pipeline courses providing required initial skill training. This column
identifies initial pipeline training courses which instruct the required tasks and knowledge identified in
Column 1, to the 1 level identified in Column 3.

3.3. Column 3. 13L1 Initial Qualification Training (IQT) Proficiency Code. This column identifies
tasks and knowledge acquired during the AFSC awarding initial qualification training pipeline.
Behavioral statement codes are used to indicate skill level performance required. This column indicates
the proficiency to be demonstrated by the graduate as a result of training on the task and knowledge.
Each CTS task has a documented behavior code. The details of each statement and the verb selected
reflect the level of training required. ALO initial qualification requirements do not change for wartime
courses. Performance coding is explained in the Proficiency Code Key, Table 3.

3.4. Column 4. 13L2 Proficiency Code. Final qualification standards for 2 level. Note some CTS
line items are unit-trained. AFI 13-113 v1 requirements not repeated.

3.5. Column 5. 13L3 Proficiency Code. Identifies training requirements in addition to
JTAC qualification.

4. Recommendations. Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to 37
TRG/DOS, 1220 Truemper Drive, Lackland AFB, TX 78236-5717. Cite a reference to specific CTS
paragraphs. A Customer Service Information Line (CSIL) has been installed for the supervisor’s
convenience to identify graduates who may have received over or under training on tasks/knowledge
items listed in this CTS. For a quick response to problems, call our CSIL, Defense Switched Network
(DSN) 473-2917.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of
knowledge for a specific task. (Example: b and 1b)
** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to
any specific task or for a subject common to several tasks.
(/x) This mark is used alone in 13L1 1-Level column to show that training is required but not given due to
limitations in resources.
- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course
Note: All knowledge tasks do not have a verb associated with the task. The verb will be identified during the POI
Part I and II development. All performance tasks will have a verb associated with the task.
