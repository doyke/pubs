                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides policy for operating the KC-135 aircraft. It
   is an original source document for many areas but, for efficacy, restates information found in
   aircraft flight manuals, flight information publications (FLIP), and other Air Force directives.
   When guidance in this AFI conflicts with another basic/source document, that document
   takes precedence. For matters where this AFI is the source document, waiver authority is
   IAW paragraph 1.4. For matters where this AFI repeats information in another document,
   follow waiver authority outlined in the basic/source document.
   1.1.2. Unit commanders and agency directors involved with or supporting KC-135
   operations shall make current copies of this AFI available to appropriate personnel.
   Transportation and Base Operations passenger manifesting agencies will maintain a current
   copy of this AFI.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to aircrew members, support personnel, and managers
involved with employing KC-135 aircraft.
1.3. Key Words Explained.
   1.3.1. “Will” and “shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. “Should” indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
   1.3.3. “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. “NOTE” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
   emphasize.
   1.3.5. “CAUTION” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   damage to equipment if not carefully followed.
   1.3.6. “WARNING” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.
1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from policies in this AFI except when the
situation demands immediate action to enhance safety. The Pilot in Command (PIC) is vested
with ultimate mission authority and responsible for each course-of-action they choose to take.
   1.4.1. Deviations. The PIC shall report deviations or exceptions taken without a waiver
   through command channels to their Chief, Major Command (MAJCOM) Stan/Eval.
   1.4.2. Waivers. Unless otherwise directed, waiver authority for contents of this instruction is
   the MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority. For U.S. Transportation Command
   (USTRANSCOM)/AMC operational missions under Operational Control (OPCON) of 18th
   Air Force, 18 AF/CC is the waiver authority. For aircrews that change OPCON (CHOP) to a
   COCOM, the COMAFFOR is the waiver authority.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                              15


       1.4.2.1. Permanent waivers affect theater unique circumstances and are enduring in
       nature. List MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM
       supplement (paragraph 1.5.).
       1.4.2.2. Long-term waivers affect multiple aircraft/multiple missions but are not
       permanent in nature (expire at a specific date/time). MAJCOM Stan/Eval shall send HQ
       AMC Stan/Eval (lead command) copies of MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved long-term
       waivers, as appropriate.
       1.4.2.3. Short-notice waivers are for specific missions in execution. PICs shall use the
       Waiver Protocol procedure in Chapter 4 to secure MAJCOM/A3/DO approval for short-
       notice waivers.
          1.4.2.3.1. USAFE planning/execution agencies may use the waiver protocol to secure
          MAJCOM/A3/DO approval for short-notice waivers.
1.5. Supplemental Procedures. This AFI is a basic directive. Each user MAJCOM or
operational theater may supplement this AFI according to AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and
Procedures, and AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. Stipulate unique MAJCOM
procedures (shall not be less restrictive than this basic document) and publish
MAJCOM/A3/DO- approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM supplement.
   1.5.1. Combined Command Operations. Plan and conduct all operations that include forces
   from multiple MAJCOMs using provisions in this AFI. Do not assume or expect aircrews to
   perform MAJCOM theater unique procedures without owning MAJCOM/A3/DO approval
   and advance training.
   1.5.2. Coordination Process. Forward MAJCOM proposed supplements (attach AF Form
   673, Request to Issue Publication) to HQ AMC/A3V for mandatory coordination prior to
   approval.
1.6. Local Supplement Coordination Process. Operations Group commanders (OG/CCs) shall
define local operating procedures to this instruction in a unit supplement. OG/CCs shall obtain
approval from Numbered Air Force (NAF), if applicable, and MAJCOM prior to releasing their
supplement. Send an electronic copy of the approved version to HQ AMC/A3V or NAF/DO (if

                                            Chapter 2

                                 COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of
the following C2 centers: 618 Air Operations Center (AOC) (Tanker Airlift Control Center
(TACC)), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) Air
Operations Centers (AOCs), Air National Guard (ANG) Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) Command Center, theater AOCs, Air Mobility Division (AMD), Joint
Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Special Air Missions Division, Office of Assistant
Vice Chief of Staff, USAF (CVAM), Unit Command Posts, Air Mobility Control Centers
(AMCC), Contingency Response Groups (CRG), Contingency response Elements (CRE), and
Special Tactics Teams (STT). C2 centers are action agents for the MAF commander with
execution authority (operational control) over mobility missions/forces.
2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF
resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority
formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2
element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training missions. The pilot in command
will execute missions operating outside normal communication channels (use last known mission
orders or best course of action).
   2.2.1. Off-Station Trainer (OST).       Refer to MAJCOM instruction for procedures and
   requirements.
       2.2.1.1. AFRC Current Operations (AFRC/A3OO) is approval authority for AFRC Unit
       Equipped (UE) OSTs.
2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an
aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights on
a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable
supplements. PICs are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly
   events authorized in the mission tasking unless, in the PIC’s judgment, an emergency
   condition demands otherwise. Fly unscheduled training events (for example, air to air
   refueling (AAR) or transition training) only after obtaining approval of the execution
   authority.
   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
   and will establish a point of contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
   crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on
   the PIC’s behalf.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                    17


   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP),
   passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission
clearance decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with
the PIC. If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that
generated the decision to delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may task
another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.4.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to
   resolve an emergency, or if required by insufficient fuel or en route or terminal weather
   conditions.
   2.4.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of
   executing departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures.
   2.4.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that
   may preclude re-route or divert.
   2.4.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will ensure
   existing and forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and airfield
   information from the Global Decision Support System (GDSS)/GDSS2/Airfield Suitability
   and Restrictions Report (ASRR), is suitable. If the alternate becomes unsuitable while en
   route, coordinate with the C2 agent for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final authority for
   accepting a suitable alternate. A C2 agent will alert customs and all appropriate ground
   service agencies to prepare for arrival.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting.
   2.5.1. Stations with MAF C2 agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data (arrival,
   departure, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system.
   2.5.2. Stations without MAF C2 agency. Transmit mission data (arrival, departure, and
   advisory messages) to the controlling C2 agency by any means available (preference in the
   following order DSN, HF, SATCOM, Airline Operational Control (AOC), iridium phone,
   etc.). For critical C2 communications, i.e. aircraft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc.,
   voice communications are the primary method.
   2.5.3. En-route Reporting.
       2.5.3.1. Make the following enroute calls to 618 AOC (TACC):
           2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
           2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.
           2.5.3.1.3. On aeromedical evacuation (AE) missions, not later than 1 hour prior to
           landing, to update arrival time and provide AF IMT 3858, C-130/C-141 Aeromedical
           Evacuation Mission Offload Message information.
           2.5.3.1.4. Uncoordinated aircraft interceptions via the most expeditious means
           available, after complying with guidance in the flight information handbook. When
           an airborne report is not accomplished, PICs must directly notify 618 AOC (TACC)
           upon landing. In all cases ensure local C2 and Intel agencies are informed.
18                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


     2.5.3.2. CONUS. Periodic “ops normal” calls/transmissions are not required; however,
     the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
     2.5.3.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures
     through a communications plan in the OPLAN, OPORD, FRAG, Mission Directive, or
     FLIP. Aircrews will maintain listening watch in accordance with the communications
     plan within aircraft equipment capabilities (e.g. HF-Automatic Link Establishment (HF-
     ALE), L-Band SATCOM, AOC).
  2.5.4. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting. PICs shall report aircraft system
  malfunctions that traditionally require extensive trouble shooting as soon as feasible. Contact
  arrival C2 agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2 for relay.
  2.5.5. Air Refueling Mission Reports.
     2.5.5.1. Tanker AAR Report. On operational missions, pilots will provide the following
     information after a tanker AAR. Under normal circumstances, send only one offload
     message, completed after the final AAR for the mission. Under abnormal circumstances
     such as receiver diverts, unsuccessful AAR, insufficient offload, or anything else that
     impacts the overall success of the mission, send a report as soon as practical.
         2.5.5.1.1. Call Sign.
         2.5.5.1.2. Fuel offloaded.
         2.5.5.1.3. Mission status.
         2.5.5.1.4. Next station.
         2.5.5.1.5. Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).
     2.5.5.2. Receiver AAR Report. On operational missions, report the following AAR
     information to the destination C2 agency after landing. C2 agencies will enter the
     information in the MAF C2 system for missions under their control. The MAJCOM C2
     agency will enter the data for all missions. Include all scheduled AARs not accomplished.
         2.5.5.2.1. AAR track.
         2.5.5.2.2. Scheduled Onload.
         2.5.5.2.3. Actual Onload.
         2.5.5.2.4. Reason Code.
         2.5.5.2.5. Additional Comments.
     2.5.5.3. Reason Codes. Reason codes indicate the outcome of air refueling activity.
     Codes are normally used when a problem or situation affects the successful
     accomplishment of the air refueling. The Reason Code “AC” will be used when air
     refueling was complete without delay or mission impact. Additional comments are
     mandatory for all reason codes except AT, WX, and AC.
         2.5.5.3.1. RO - Receiver Operations.
         2.5.5.3.2. RM - Receiver Maintenance.
         2.5.5.3.3. RW - Receiver Weather.

         2.5.5.3.4. TO - Tanker Operations.
         2.5.5.3.5. TM - Tanker Maintenance.
         2.5.5.3.6. TW - Tanker Weather.
         2.5.5.3.7. AT - Air Traffic Control.
         2.5.5.3.8. WX - Air Refueling Track Adverse Weather.
         2.5.5.3.9. AC - Air Refueling Complete.
  2.5.6. “Thirty Minute” Out Call. Transmit an AOC message, UHF, or VHF arrival advisory
  to the destination C2 agency approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Provide Estimated
  Time in Blocks (ETB).
  2.5.7. Integrated Flight Management (IFM) sorties. On IFM sorties, the flight managers
  (FM) will be the C2 conduit for aviators. For critical C2 communications, voice
  communications (HF, DSN, SATCOM, iridium phone etc.) are the primary method.
  EXCEPTION: For AFRC/ANG missions using IFM, AFRC/ANG will provide C2.
     2.5.7.1. Position Reporting on IFM sorties. IFM sorties transiting oceanic flight
     information regions (FIRs) need to add the phrase “Pass to Hilda/Pearl-KC-135” to ATC
     voice position reports (N/A for datalink sorties). Crews may also use the ARINC
     frequencies listed in the aircrew flimsy for C2 phone patch requirements. Use ARINC
     phone patch only after exhausting normal communication methods.
  2.5.8. High Frequency (HF) Communications. HF is the primary means of voice access to
  the worldwide C2 network. If secure global communications are required, use secure UHF
  SATCOM or Iridium satellite phone with secure sleeve.
     2.5.8.1. The secondary HF radio (if equipped) will be operated to the max extent
     possible in Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) mode to support voice contacts between
     the PIC and MAJCOM C2. NOTE: Run the ALE system in the silent mode during
     flights where pilots use the HF radio system for communication with ATC.
  2.5.9. SATCOM System. SATCOM telephone calls are “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” and
  calls will only be made when other means of communications have been exhausted and an
  urgent operational need exists.
  2.5.10. Not Used.
  2.5.11. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers may be
  transmitted at the discretion of the PIC.
  2.5.12. Iridium Phone. Iridium phones may be used for communications between aircrews
  and command and control agencies when beyond-line of sight C2 is required and other line
  of sight communications do not provide proper security or timeliness. For more information
  refer to AMC Iridium Satellite Phone CONOPS for Aircrews, 1 Feb 06, including interim
  change          2006-1,         available         at         https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

  EC2D96790FB5E044080020E329A9.
     2.5.12.1. Turn off Iridium phones within 25 feet of ground refueling operations.
 20                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


      2.5.12.2. Turn off Iridium phones during takeoff, tanker/receiver AAR, approach, and
      landing. EXCEPTION: If operational necessity requires use of the Iridium phone during
      tanker AAR, the phone should be removed from the cradle and used with the portable
      antenna only.
   2.5.13. AOC messaging to and from C2 agencies is available and can be used in-lieu of
   voice communication. For local missions, or other missions not controlled by 618 AOC
   (TACC), AOC messaging is between the aircraft and owning Command Post.
2.6. Mission Commander (MC).
   2.6.1. Unit commanders shall designate a MC when more than two aircraft are assembled to
   perform missions away from home station. Unit commanders should consider appointing a
   MC for special, high-visibility missions (i.e. CAPSTONE, DV2, etc.). The MC has overall
   responsibility and is the final authority for decisions that impact mission execution. The MC
   shall properly coordinate mission details. For IFM sorties, MC shall coordinate any special
   mission planning requirements with the IFM mission allocator not later than 24 hours prior to
   mission execution.
      2.6.1.1. For MAJCOM-tasked missions, MAJCOM/A3/DO will coordinate and
      designate a lead planning agency when more than one unit is involved in an operation.
      For AMC-tasked missions this responsibility falls to 618 AOC (TACC). The OG/CC or
      equivalent for the lead planning agency will designate a MC. The MC will be a rated
      (normally field grade) officer qualified in the type mission.
      2.6.1.2. For fighter moves, a planner in the tasked unit(s) will coordinate tanker support
      with Air Combat Command (ACC) Air Operations Squadron (AOS) and provide tanker
      flight planning based on ACC AOS/AODX produced profile.
   2.6.2. During MAJCOM AOS planned moves, the tanker MC is the final authority and shall
   ensure tanker aircrew members have properly coordinated mission details for the deployment
   IAW AFI 11-207, Combat Aircraft Delivery.
      2.6.2.1. The MC will ensure all collocated aircrew members attend required briefings.
      The MC and all tanker aircrew members will attend the appropriate MAJCOM
      AOS/Delivery Control Officer (DCO) pre-takeoff briefing. The PIC may excuse boom
      operators from required briefings to accomplish preflight duties. Cover tanker specific
      information in the pre-takeoff briefing to coordinate all takeoff, formation, en route,
      AAR, and recovery requirements between tanker and receiver aircraft.
      2.6.2.2. When non-collocated, the MC (in conjunction with the lead planning agency)
      will ensure non-collocated aircrew members receive applicable information, to include
      rendezvous, formation, abort, and recovery procedures.
2.7. DUAL ROLE Procedures
   2.7.1. A valid DUAL ROLE contains the following:
      2.7.1.1. A MAJCOM-validated AAR requirement. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOK must
      receive validated requirement NLT 14 days before mission start date to ensure proper
      mission support.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 21


       2.7.1.2. A MAJCOM validated and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOKP approved user cargo
       requirement of at least two pallets of cargo, not including baggage.
   2.7.2. Since DUAL ROLE is primarily an AAR mission, the tanker must first meet the AAR
   requirement without regard to protecting ancillary cargo capability.
   2.7.3. AMC does not guarantee DUAL ROLE ancillary cargo movements and will not
   expend additional tanker sorties or hours for the purpose of moving ancillary cargo.
   2.7.4. 618 AOC (TACC) will normally refuse DUAL ROLE requests that require excessive
   KC-135 positioning or de-positioning time unless KC-135 aircrew members will receive
   effective training on positioning and de-positioning legs. NOTE: MAJCOM/A3/DO may
   grant exceptions for missions that do not meet these criteria but reduce total fiscal cost, do
   not impact other tanker requirements, and present the most practical means available to move
   cargo. For 618 AOC (TACC) missions, AMC/A3 delegates approval authority for dual-role
   coronet missions to the 618 AOC/CC. For AFRC and ANG missions, consider unit
   identified training needs to justify positioning and de-positioning time.
2.8. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Crewmembers may use the 618 AOC (TACC) toll-free
number, 1-800-AIR-MOBL or DSN 312-779-0320, to contact other offices within the 618 AOC
(TACC), including flight managers.
2.9. Close Watch Missions. Close Watch missions (for example, Combat Search and Rescue
(CSAR); Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), PHOENIX BANNERs) receive special C2 attention.
PICs will promptly notify appropriate C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other events that effect on-
time departure. Provide the C2 agent the estimated time in commission (ETIC), planned ETD,
and estimated time of arrival (ETA) within 10 minutes of the event or as soon as safety allows.
2.10. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DOD) to
cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-
801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, provides the policies and procedures
service members must follow when supporting federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement
agencies. Coordinate all civilian law enforcement authorities’ requests for assistance through
appropriate C2 channels.
2.11. En-route Maintenance Support. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL will support all mobility
aircraft requests for parts and/or maintenance assistance on TRANSCOM/AMC missions. Refer
to paragraph 2.8 for 618 AOC (TACC) telephone numbers.
 22                                                       AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013

                       AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow these policies to form aircrews and to develop aircrew-
related work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide
operations.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking. Table 3.1
summarizes crew position requirements for different crew types.
   3.2.1. The minimum crew member complement for a local training flight is an aircraft
   commander, a pilot/copilot, and a boom operator (BO).
   3.2.2. SQ/CCs shall form augmented aircrews for missions planned to take longer than a
   basic CDT. Augmenting aircrew members must be current, qualified, and Mission Ready
   (MR) IAW AFI 11-2KC-135V1, KC-135 Aircrew Training. EXCEPTIONS: A Non-
   Mission Ready (NMR) pilot may augment provided the other two pilots are MR IPs. A non-
   current or unqualified BO may be used as an augmentee if accompanied by a MR instructor
   BO. The non-current or unqualified BO must be qualified to perform the required mission
   (i.e., cargo qualified, fighter qualified, etc.) or else be supervised by the instructor BO during
   all portions of the mission for which he/she is not fully qualified. SQ/CC shall augment an
   aircrew for the full FDP. The MAJCOM/A3/DO may designate an augmented CDT/FDP if
   the crew compliment is manned accordingly while the flight is underway (see paragraph 3.7.
   for more on CDT/FDP).

NOTES:
1. An additional BO may be included for scheduled cargo operations.
2. When departing home station, an additional crew member certified by SQ/CC in passenger
handling must be assigned to the mission when more than 10 passengers (Space A/MEP/Duty Pax)
are planned to be carried on any leg. Up to three dedicated crew chiefs do not count against the
number of passengers.
3. A basic navigator may be added to an augmented crew (non-SOAR mission) (N/A ANG). In this
case, the PIC will determine a work/rest plan that affords the navigator sufficient rest periods during
the mission.
3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified, or in qualification
training, to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Officer Course (SOC) (restricted AF Form 8,
   Certificate of Aircrew Qualification) or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight
   may occupy a primary crew position when under direct instructor supervision. Refer to AFI
   11-401, Aviation Management, for procedures and requirements governing senior leader
   flying.
       3.3.1.1. Senior Officers who complete the SOC must adhere to the restrictions listed in
       their AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   3.3.2. Crewmembers who complete the SOC will log “FP/FN” for Flight Authorization Duty
   Code on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
   3.3.3. Crewmembers who complete a Senior Staff Familiarization flight will log “OP/ON”
   for Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781.
3.4. Pilots. An instructor pilot (IP) must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining
currency or qualification (direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight).
   3.4.1. SQ/CCs shall augment the PIC for missions over 16 hours Flight Duty Period (FDP)
   and designate those additional pilots authorized to perform PIC duties. The PIC shall brief
   the aircrew on the plan to transfer PIC duties.
   3.4.2. Initial qualification pilots enrolled in a MAJCOM approved training course may
   accomplish tanker/receiver AAR under IP supervision.
   3.4.3. Missions With Passengers. Only current and qualified pilots (possessing a valid AF
   Form 8) will occupy pilot seats with passengers on board (N/A MEP).
       3.4.3.1. A non-current but qualified pilot may fly with passengers on board if under
       direct IP supervision.
       3.4.3.2. Pilots shall not fly touch-and-go landings with passengers or hazardous cargo on
       board. Touch-and-go landings and stop-and-go landings are authorized with MEP on
       board.
   3.4.4. ACs may perform receiver AAR from the right seat while under direct IP supervision.
 24                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


3.5. Navigators. A non-current or unqualified navigator may serve as a primary aircrew
member on any mission when supervised by a qualified instructor navigator (N/A ANG). An IP
may supervise navigators regaining currency on non-SOAR missions (N/A ANG).
3.6. Boom Operators. A non-current or unqualified BO may serve as a primary aircrew
member on any mission when supervised by a qualified instructor BO or flight examiner BO
(direct supervision for critical phases of flight).
   3.6.1. A non-current or unqualified boom operator may be used as an augmentee provided a
   fully qualified instructor boom operator is on board. The instructor boom operator shall
   supervise the non-current or unqualified boom operator during portions of the mission where
   the non-current or unqualified boom operator performs primary crew duties. SQ/CC may
   include two boom operators on complex missions requiring additional crewmembers.
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles
permit an aircrew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time
   and ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
   SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Once en-
   route, the mission directive or C2 agent will inform the PIC of expected FDP at show time.
   Reduce FDP when the autopilot altitude hold fails or FMS cannot be coupled to the autopilot
   after departure IAW information below. If the autopilot fails after departure, consider
   mission requirements and determine the best course of action to preclude further mission
   delays due to reduced FDP. The best course of action may include diverting to an airfield
   with maintenance capability. Contact C2, coordinate intentions, and comply with limitations.
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 16 hours (12 hours
       when the autopilot altitude hold is inoperative or the autopilot cannot be coupled to the
       FMS). All AAR and tactical events will be accomplished within the first 14 hours of the
       FDP.
          3.7.1.1.1. Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP, only MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend
          to augmented day regardless of aircrew composition (MAJCOM/A3/DO shall
          augment basic crew to extend FDP).
          3.7.1.1.2. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
          weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
          augmented FDP, a PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
          long as:
              3.7.1.1.2.1. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before
              the first takeoff of the day.
              3.7.1.1.2.2. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate
              rest en route.
              3.7.1.1.2.3. A PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3/DO (mission
              execution authority) approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a
              scheduled mission. Only use this provision to recover from
              unscheduled/unplanned en route delays. C2 agents shall not ask a PIC to exercise
              this option.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                             25


     3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 24 hours
     (16 hours when the autopilot altitude hold is inoperative or the autopilot cannot be
     coupled to the FMS). All AAR and tactical events will be accomplished within the first
     18 hours of the FDP. SQ/CC need only augment the pilot portion of the aircrew when
     the autopilot altitude hold is inoperative or the autopilot cannot be coupled to the FMS.
         3.7.1.2.1. SQ/CC will augment an aircrew when FDP exceeds 16 hours and the
         mission profile will allow augmenting aircrew members adequate time to rest en
         route. As a minimum, the mission profile must provide the following:
            3.7.1.2.1.1. No more than 3 intermediate stops after 14 hours of FDP (each
            receiver AAR shall count as an intermediate stop).
            3.7.1.2.1.2. Mission profile shall include at least one 6 hour leg or two 4 hour
            legs.
            3.7.1.2.1.3. The PIC shall validate planned leg times based on actual conditions.
            PICs may swap an extended ground time (4 hours) for a mission leg when
            conditions afford aircrew members a chance for rest.
     3.7.1.3. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
     3.7.1.4. Training and Functional Check Flights/Acceptance Check Flights (FCFs/ACFs)
     FDP:
         3.7.1.4.1. 16 hours (12 hours when the autopilot altitude hold is inoperative or the
         FMS cannot be coupled to the autopilot).
         3.7.1.4.2. Complete all mission-related events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, transition
         events, or tactical events) during the first 12 hours of the FDP.
         3.7.1.4.3. ANG, AFRC and Associate Unit crewmembers may perform all mission-
         related events on local training missions provided their time from start of CDT/FDP
         does not exceed 16 hours and actual flight duty does not exceed 12 hours.
            3.7.1.4.3.1. Crew duty time (CDT) and FDP include both military duty and
            civilian work. CDT and FDP begin when an individual reports for their first duty
            period (military or civilian).
  3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform
  combined ground/flight duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-
  mission duties within maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related
  duties for other missions when approved by member’s home station SQ/CC or equivalent.
  Maximum CDT is 18+00 hours for a basic aircrew and 24+45 hours for an augmented
  aircrew.
  3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification.
  SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
  flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew
  member early: begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties.
     3.7.3.1. Crews may self-alert with C2 (618 AOC (TACC) for AMC and AMC-gained
     missions) concurrence prior to entering crew rest. The PIC must coordinate (618 AOC
     (TACC) approval required for AMC and AMC-gained missions) the self-alert time
 26                                                   AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


      before entering crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for
      duty.
      3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, for waiver
      authority.
   3.7.4. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) Time. IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management,
   MAF aircrew members may travel as additional crewmembers (not required for the mission
   being flown but required for follow-on missions) as MEP. MEP will not be listed on the
   AFTO Form 781, will not log time, and will not accrue OFDA credit. Crewmembers may
   travel as MEP for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers
   to travel as MEP in excess of 24 hours.
      3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
      traveling in MEP status provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report
      time for MEP flight).
      3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may travel in MEP status after performing primary crew
      duties, for a maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember’s FDP began.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-
   /offload, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3. The duty day
   begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions IAW AFI 11-202V3. In addition, SQ/CCs shall not schedule an
aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff or
   ALFA standby force legal for alert time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while
   impaired by its after effects.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight.
   An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as “get-me-
   downs” following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight. Following use,
   crewmember will be considered DNIF until cleared by a flight surgeon.
3.9. Fatigue Countermeasures Management Program.
   3.9.1. AMC/A3 will establish policy for implementation of the Fatigue Countermeasures
   (CM) Management Program and ensure compliance with its provisions, and AMC/SG will
   provide clinical oversight, guidance and materials for fatigue CM education and mitigation.
   3.9.2. OG/CCs will ensure Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs include use
   of the basic fatigue countermeasures found in the AvORM worksheet. Both the manual and
   automated “MAF Mission Aviation ORM Worksheet” incorporate a fatigue CM risk
   assessment model. They are available on the AMC/A3V website under the “Pubs” tab,
   “Operational Risk Management (ORM)” section, and will be used by all three tiers of
   mission planners, as well as aircrew during the mission execution phase.
   3.9.3. Flight surgeons will use the AMC-approved (lead command) fatigue CM training CDs
   and pamphlets provided by AMC/SGP to educate their operational fliers in venues such as
   clinic visits, flight physicals, Safety Down Days, pre-deployment briefings, readiness
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                               27


  training, Commanders' Calls, First-Term Airmen Courses, base orientations and safety
  meetings.
  3.9.4. The primary fatigue CM available to aircrew members is appropriate management of
  their sleep/rest cycles. Secondary CM include smart scheduling procedures aimed at
  managing those cycles, strategic inflight and/or ground napping techniques, and proper diet
  and exercise.
  3.9.5. An additional fatigue CM tool available to aircrew is the No-Go Pill. The occasional
  use of a No-Go Pill by MAF aircrew to improve sleep quality and/or adjust circadian rhythm
  sleep/wake cycles is voluntary. Each individual aircrew member will, with the aid of their
  home station flight surgeon, determine how/if to implement the use of No-Go Pills as a
  fatigue CM.
  3.9.6. The following directives concerning the use of No-Go Pills are as important and
  unbreakable as the “12 hour bottle to throttle” restriction for alcohol consumption:
     3.9.6.1. Aircrew members on flight orders will not use No-Go Pills in flight.
     3.9.6.2. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for any No-Go Pill they wish to
     use for operational purposes and document using MAF No-Go Pill Form 1, Ground
     Testing of No-Go Pills. In order to avoid possible drug interactions, aircrew members
     will inform the flight surgeon of any over-the-counter medications and/or nutritional
     supplements they are taking. During ground testing, aircrew members will be DNIF on an
     AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation For Flying or Special Operational Duty Log,
     for the minimum ‘DNIF’ periods prescribed in paragraph 3.9.6.4 below. After ground
     testing of a particular No-Go Pill, the flight surgeon will complete the bottom half of the
     Form 1 and a “return to fly” AF Form 1042. Successful ground testing of a particular
     No-Go Pill establishes clearance to use it operationally.
     3.9.6.3. Aircrew members may obtain No-Go Pills from any USAF or other authorized
     flight surgeon while at home station or off-station while TDY/deployed. Off-
     station/deployed flight surgeons can verify individual aircrew ground testing results via
     the “MAF Aircrew Medication Ground Test Card” all MAF aircrew members are
     required to carry.
     3.9.6.4. In no case will an individual perform aircrew duties while under the effects of
     No-Go Pills. Individuals will use the mission report or legal for alert time to determine
     the latest time to take a No-Go Pill. The following are the minimum ‘DNIF’ periods (no
     AF Form 1042 required) after consuming a No-Go Pill:
         3.9.6.4.1. Sonata (Zaleplon) – 4 hours minimum ‘DNIF’
         3.9.6.4.2. Ambien (Zolpidem) – 6 hours minimum ‘DNIF’
         3.9.6.4.3. Restoril (Temazepam, Class IV Controlled Substance) – 12 hours
         minimum ‘DNIF’NOTE: No-Go medications can affect individuals very differently.
         To comply with the “no aircrew duties while under the effects” restriction, it is the
         responsibility of each individual aircrew member to be aware of their own minimum
         ‘DNIF’ period for any No-Go Pill they use, based on their ground trial results and/or
         previous experiences.
28                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


     3.9.6.5. Aircrew members will consider the following examples of missions prone to
     causing fatigue and/or sleep disruptions in their decision to use a No-Go Pill:
        3.9.6.5.1. Home station night launch missions with 2000-0530L show times and
        greater than four hours’ duration.
        3.9.6.5.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal (i.e., quiet, air-conditioned,
        darkened) sleeping environment.
        3.9.6.5.3. Off-station missions that are four or more time zones from home station.
        3.9.6.5.4. Rotating or stair-stepped flying schedules with greater than 6-hour flight
        time duration.
        3.9.6.5.5. Missions that run consistently near a 12 to 14 hour duty day.
     3.9.6.6. The MAF’s worldwide mobility mission makes accountability for this program
     challenging; therefore, the following are aircrew member responsibilities:
        3.9.6.6.1. Aircrew members will not operate heavy equipment during the minimum
        ‘DNIF’ period for each No-Go Pill outlined in paragraph 3.9.6.4 above.
        3.9.6.6.2. Aircrew members will not take No-Go Pills within 12 hours of consuming
        alcohol, as their combined use unpredictably increases the effects of both.
        3.9.6.6.3. Aircrew members will limit use of Ambien (Zolpidem) and Restoril
        (Temazepam) to a maximum of seven consecutive days and no more than 20 days in
        a 60-day period. Flight surgeons should prescribe 60 days’ worth of medication (20
        pills) at a time if requested by the aircrew member, unless clinically inadvisable.
        3.9.6.6.4. Aircrew members will limit use of Sonata (Zaleplon) to a maximum of 10
        consecutive days and no more than 28 days in a 60-day period. Flight surgeons
        should prescribe 60 days’ worth of medication (28 pills) if requested by the aircrew
        member, unless clinically inadvisable.
        3.9.6.6.5. If an aircrew member uses Sonata in combination with either of the other
        types of No-Go Pills, the seven consecutive days and 20-days in a 60 day period
        restrictions apply (overrides the 10 consecutive days and 28 days in a 60-day period
        for Sonata).
        3.9.6.6.6. Aircrew members may consume more than one No-Go Pill in a 24-hour
        period, if operationally necessary. A second No-Go Pill of the same or different type
        will not be consumed while in the minimum ‘DNIF’ period for the previous pill.
        3.9.6.6.7. The “MAF No-Go Pill Usage/Refill Form” will be used to document No-
        Go Pill use and refill authorization, and placed in the aircrew member’s medical
        record. Non-duty station flight surgeons will forward the form to the aircrew
        member’s home station aerospace medicine clinic to be placed in their medical
        record. Flight surgeons will immediately discuss any concerns about an aircrew
        member’s use of No-Go Pills with the individual’s commander if any question of
        misuse arises.
        3.9.6.6.8. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will
        follow PRP notification procedures if prescribed No-Go Pills.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  29


3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place
crewmembers in crew rest. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive any portion of the crew rest period or
ground time as needed to meet mission tasking.
   3.10.1. Home-Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew
   members off station 16 hours or more, unit commanders will enter aircrew members into pre-
   departure crew rest 24 hours before the legal for alert time. Aircrew members may perform
   limited non-flying duties like mission planning during the first 12 hours of pre-departure
   crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. Do
   not manifest MEP aircrew members as passengers to deny pre-departure crew rest.
   EXCEPTION: AFRC, ANG, and AETC in accordance with AFI 11-202V3 and appropriate
   supplement.
   3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours
   before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
      3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3/DO, C2 agents
      shall not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
      members’ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
      rest period after they complete official duties.
      3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
      flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, cargo on/offload,
      aircrew arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
   3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners shall provide aircrews at least
   17 hours ground time between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff.
      3.10.3.1. Mission planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify ground time as follows:
          3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
          3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
          the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
          to complete mission planning, cargo up-/offload, and non-standard mission related
          duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs to accept less than 17 hours ground time.
      3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground
      times longer than 17 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from the
      cumulative effects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
      transiting several time zones. If practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours
      (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
   3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
   flight delay but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
   report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods will be of minimum duration and are
   normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities will approve requests to delay
   alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when mission allows.
   When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the reason for
   disapproval.
 30                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
   home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
   personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination. (N/A ANG, AFRC and AETC).
       3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
       provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
       members in pre- departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
       3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3/DO may
       suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
       3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
   3.10.6. Crew Chief (CC) Work/Rest Plan. While on Temporary Duty (TDY), the deployed
   FCC or MEP maintenance technician shall report to the PIC. In conjunction with
   enroute/transient maintenance supervisor, the PIC will determine how long the crew chief
   can safely perform aircraft maintenance duties. The PIC shall ensure the crew chief has
   sufficient time in each 24- hour period to get 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. See AFI 21-101,
   Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance.
   3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved crew rest
   criteria in the Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN)
   or Concept of Operations (CONOPs).
   3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft
   parking ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive
   accurate aircrew/mission information in a timely manner.
       3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. A MAJCOM C2 agent will forward information on
       the departing aircrew’s orders to a POC for the next crew rest location’s Prime Knight
       function.
       3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a
       C2 agent has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight
       POC. If departing from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew
       rest location Prime Knight POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
       3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders
       clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime Knight reservations in
       advance. Without a unit fund cite on the TDY/Flight orders, the PIC must make advance
       reservations using a government travel card to participate in the Prime Knight program.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
crews. Whenever possible, C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected
patient up load time, and other pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
   3.11.1. Aircrew alert time is normally 4+l5 hours before scheduled takeoff time (allows 1
   hour for reporting and 3+l5 hours for mission preparation). Individual locations may increase
   or decrease this time depending on specific capabilities. OG/CCs may establish self-alert
   procedures for local training missions.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  31


      3.11.1.1. For missions with more than minimum ground time, the PIC may arrange an
      alert time that provides additional preparation time to accomplish the mission. The PIC
      may also accept alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows. In all
      cases, the PIC shall coordinate changes to standard alerting times with the appropriate C2
      agency.
      3.11.1.2. With PIC agreement and when cargo load warrants, C2 agents may alert boom
      operators up to 2 hours before normal alert time. When early alerting is warranted, the
      PIC and C2 agent must notify the BO before he/she enters crew rest. Do not alert the BO
      more than 1 hour before beginning cargo up load. Base the aircrew FDP on the BO’s
      show time.
      3.11.1.3. C2 agents shall not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there
      is reasonable assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the
      aircrew time to pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
      3.11.1.4. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-
      3 status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the
      aircraft will be repaired within the target ground time.
      3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must
      coordinate with controlling C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational
      missions at locations with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to
      avoid FDP limitations that result from unexpected changes in the mission.
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
      3.11.2.1. On the aircrew’s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
      agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
      3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
      alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
      12 hours when traveling in MEP status. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to
      accept more than the 6 hour window. ANG/ AFRC aircrew members may extend the
      window as necessary to travel in MEP status to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled
      Return Time (FSRT).
      3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
      during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
      the C2 agent will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours
      from the time of notification.
      3.11.2.4. If the mission cannot depart within 4+00 hours of any scheduled takeoff, the
      PIC may continue the mission after a thorough re-evaluation of all ORM factors. The
      controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept a takeoff outside of the 4 hour
      window. The PIC will coordinate with C2 to continue the mission or enter crew rest and
      establish a legal for alert time.
3.12. Stage Management
   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy:
 32                                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


       3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
       3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
       3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
       3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
       mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
   3.12.2. Mechanical Stage. A C2 agent may create a mechanical stage when a delayed or
   aborted mission will not resume before that aircrew’s FDP expires. Aircrews in a mechanical
   stage will be first out when a mission in the same direction transits their location while they
   are legal for alert. A C2 agent may bump an inbound aircrew with FDP to complete that
   mission to cycle aircrews in a mechanical stage. C2 agents should not normally establish a
   mechanical stage for ANG and AFRC crews flying unit-equipped aircraft.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to legal for alert time. This allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-
standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When aircrews are unable to complete
all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby
crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall
place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest and follow aircraft generation procedures in
paragraph 3.7.5 to prepare the aircraft for launch. SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in
ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend this period for
contingencies. After completion of an alert period, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12
hour pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may provide additional local procedures for management
of Standby Force Duties. EXCEPTION: Aircrew supporting the 618 AOC (TACC) Mx Bravo
Alert tasking can be placed in Bravo Alert for up to 120 hours (5 days). In addition, aircrew in
Mx Bravo Alert may voluntarily perform ground training requirements during normal waking
hours between 1000- 1500L.
   3.13.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC
   shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour.
   The following procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare aircraft generated for
   ALFA alerts. A maintenance Dash -6 and aircrew Dash -1 preflight must be completed.
   Preflight validity will be in accordance with applicable T.O. After the preflight, the PIC will
   notify the controlling agency. The aircraft will remain in a sealed posture and be referred to
   as “cocked on alert”. Documentation of when the aircraft was cocked on alert must be placed
   in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before entering crew rest. Secure all
   hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. Close the crew entrance door and seal in a
   manner which will prevent entry without damage to the seal. The aircrew preflight portion
   remains valid if performed by one crew, cocked on alert, and launched by another crew.
   Uncocking a generated aircraft is not a standard procedure but may be accomplished on a
   case by case basis. The PIC or a designated aircrew representative must be present if access
   to the aircraft is required. Ensure command and control and the controlling agency are
   notified when uncocking and re-cocking generated aircraft. Follow-on pre-flights done
   during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when C2 agent
   directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while performing pre- flight (begin CDT/FDP
   when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 33


   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
   aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours. Follow-on pre-flights, if
   required, interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter them
   into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent standby force
   duty.
   3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a 12
   hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be able
   to launch within 3+15 hours. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12 hour
   crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.
   3.13.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
   dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
   of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
   post- mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time.
   3.13.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
   standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
       3.13.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
       computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
       3.13.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized.
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation,
AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the
exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between mobility units to
accomplish flying missions. Interfly will be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special
circumstances. However, it may be used for events of longer duration such as unit conversion to
another model design series (MDS). AFRC/A3 has delegated interfly approval authority to unit
OG/CCs for active duty/ANG interfly with AFRC and AFRC to AFRC interfly. Units utilizing
this authority will inform AFRC/A3V. NGB/A3 has delegated approval authority to Wing
Commanders for active duty/AFRC interfly with ANG, and OG/CC approval authority for ANG
to ANG interfly. ANG units will ensure appropriate active duty General Officer support staff has
notified the Air Force Directorate of Personnel General Officer Management Office (AF/DPG)
prior to any active duty General Officer flying with their unit. Participating aircrews will use
guidelines established by the host command or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS.
EXCEPTION: AE crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements. Conduct interfly
operations as follows:
   3.15.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified in the MDS aircraft and model, as
   well as unique systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission.
 34                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   3.15.2. Each affected group commander who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must
   concur with interfly proposal.
   3.15.3. MDS conversion training.
       3.15.3.1. Units may request an interfly agreement for duration of their conversion.
       OG/CCs will forward interfly requests to individual OG/CCs for approval. Requests will
       include as a minimum a list of effected units, duration of the agreement, and purpose.
3.16. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). Procedures and policies regarding MEP are
contained in AFI 11-401 and AMCI 11-208. PICs will ensure personnel traveling in this status
are properly authorized. Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are authorized MEP status
on any mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of mobility operations. MAJCOM
designated crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to accompany the normal crew
compliment are allowed MEP status.
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in MEP status are not authorized to:
       3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave. EXCEPTION: ANG/AFRC Air
       Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while traveling en route to perform in a
       military duty status.
       3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM)
       aircraft unless authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically
       restricted by the mission directive.
       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by Joint
       Operational Support Airlift Command (JOSAC) through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All MEPs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing MEP
   status. OG/CCs may authorize MEP status for their mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other MEP. The
   priority for evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, and then squadron level.
   3.16.4. MEPs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of MEPs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the ATOC,
   who in turn will coordinate with the passenger terminal; seats not previously assigned may be
   used for MEPs.
   3.16.5. The PIC or designated representative, will brief MEPs on seat assignment,
   appropriate mission information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed
   crewmembers. The PIC may assign any MEP aircrew-related duties for which the MEP is
   qualified.
   3.16.6. MEPs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel.
   They will process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to
   planned block time.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                            35


3.17. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives
may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility
mission familiarization.
3.18. Flight Attendants on Distinguished Visitor Missions. Flight attendants may fly as
primary crewmembers on designated KC-135 missions. They fall under the authority of the PIC,
or MC (if assigned), throughout the mission. An egress briefing will be given to the flight
attendants prior to the first mission leg.

                                           Chapter 4

                        AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a
component/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall
suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the
discrepancy is entered in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document;
include the following maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status.
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component essential for safe aircraft operation as ME.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These
   discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or
   mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a
   MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely
   impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally
   cleared at home station.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL is a pre-launch document that lists
the minimum equipment/systems to operate the aircraft. It is impractical to prepare a list that
would anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent
circumstances. Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items. A PIC
who accepts an aircraft with degraded equipment is not committed to subsequent operations with
the same degraded equipment. Once the PIC accepts an aircraft the MEL has priority over the
MESL. PICs are not committed to operations with degraded equipment accepted by another PIC.
   4.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued
   operation with inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued
   operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
   4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
   requirements/directives.
   4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a
   waiver through C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agent: 1) nature of request, 2)
   individual crew member qualification, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, and 4) weather
   or other adverse condition, and 5) the governing directive(s) of waiver request to include
   volume, chapter, or paragraph. Initiate waiver requests as soon as possible; plan at least a 1-
   hour waiver process time.
   4.2.4. PICs operating with waiver(s) for degraded equipment shall coordinate mission
   requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements,
   etc.) with the controlling C2 agency and/or flight manager.
   4.2.5. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or
   aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 37


   may deviate according to paragraph 1.4. Report deviations (without waiver) through
   channels to MAJCOM/A3/DO within 48-hours. OG/CCs shall collect background
   information and submit a follow-up written report upon request.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis. The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical
level of command. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
   4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority.
   Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency. (AMC) For operational missions, the 18
   AF/CC is the waiver authority for active duty, AFRC, or ANG units flying MAJCOM-
   directed missions (includes Operational Readiness Inspections). Initiate the request with
   MAJCOM C2 agency. For AMC-directed missions contact HQ AMC/A3V through 618
   AOC (TACC).
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. DIRMOBFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not
   specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. ANG or AFRC Directed Missions. ANG or AFRC maintains C2 and waiver authority
   for ANG or AFRC directed mission prior to mobilization. NGB/A3 delegates waiver
   authority to the unit OG/CC.
   4.3.5. Other Than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight
   Manual, Maintenance T.O., etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify
   the appropriate waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response
   time.
   4.3.6. Engineering Dispositions (ED). Dispositions are requested when aircraft are damaged
   and/or established maintenance technical order procedures cannot be followed or do not
   exist. The on-site maintenance authority is responsible for requesting EDs. Most EDs allow
   maintenance to repair the aircraft and return it to unrestricted status; dispositions of this
   nature do not concern aircrews. However, EDs affecting aircrew operations require MEL
   waiver authority approval.
       4.3.6.1. PICs shall coordinate dispositions containing flight restrictions, prohibitions,
       additional operating limits, or modified/nonstandard operating procedures with the
       appropriate MEL waiver authority (see paragraph 4.3).
       4.3.6.2. PICs will not accept dispositions appearing incomplete, in error, or unsafe. Prior
       to rejecting a disposition, the PIC will contact the appropriate MEL waiver authority. The
       waiver authority will attempt to resolve the issue. NOTE: Deviations from the flight
       manual requires approval IAW the flight manual.
4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance
from their home unit or MAJCOM C2 agency.
4.5. MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers. MEL tables are arranged by aircraft system
to provide the PIC a mechanism to determine minimum system requirements. Components are
listed by number installed and minimum required for flight. Requirements are defined by Home
Station/Main Operating Base (MOB) Departure (Column A) and en route (Column B). An
asterisk (*) in the Required column indicates the number required is situation dependent; refer to
 38                                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


the Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions column for clarification. MOB is a location that has
adequate maintenance to repair an aircraft. The term enroute refers to enroute locations where
maintenance capability does not exist. Home station local sorties fall under column A.
   4.5.1. Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are
   contained in this column. This is not all-inclusive; crewmembers shall refer to the flight
   manual and other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.
       4.5.1.1. One-time Flight Clarification: A Red X discrepancy must be downgraded
       through maintenance channels prior to flight. MEL waiver may still be required. This
       condition does not preclude carrying cargo and passengers unless stipulated otherwise by
       the waiver. The priority is to move the airplane to a repair capable facility. PICs must
       coordinate with appropriate agencies to ensure repair capability exists at the destination.
       One-time flights may include en route stops only when necessary to recover the airplane.
       Example: An airplane departs on a gear-down flight from Djibouti IAP and requires an
       en route fuel stop (Cairo) before landing at the nearest repair capable facility, Sigonella
       NAS.
           4.5.1.1.1. One-time flight to nearest repair capable facility: Flight is limited to the
           nearest (shortest en route time) repair capable base.
           4.5.1.1.2. One-time flight to a repair capable facility: Flight is not restricted to the
           nearest repair capable facility.
       4.5.1.2. Other Mission and Repair Clarifications:
           4.5.1.2.1. Shall be repaired at next repair capable facility: Mission may continue as
           scheduled, item shall be repaired upon reaching a repair capable facility. Designate
           item ME upon reaching repair facility. Once maintenance action is initiated, and it is
           determined repairs are not possible, the PIC will discuss possible courses of action
           with C2 agency to return aircraft to service.
           4.5.1.2.2. Mission dictates requirement: PIC shall consider the entire mission profile,
           not just the next leg. Example: An airplane is departing an en route station with
           repair capability, after engine start the PIC discovers the #1 engine anti-ice is
           inoperative. Icing conditions are not forecasted for the next leg. However, because the
           mission spans several days and repair capability does not exist at the scheduled en
           route stops, the PIC elects to have the item repaired prior to departing.
   4.5.2. Aircraft Model Identification. The tables apply to KC-135 /R/T model aircraft.
   Specific information for aircraft modified with TCTO 628, Multi Point Refueling System
   (MPRS), is listed in tables 4.19 through 4.26
   4.5.3. Minimum Equipment List. The Tables are divided into major systems.

4.6. Not Used.
4.7. Supplements. Each MAJCOM may supplement the MEL (see Chapter 1).
4.8. One Engine Inoperative Ferry Operations. PICs will only conduct 3-engine ferry
operations after exhausting all other avenues to return an aircraft with an inoperative engine to
MC status. Each three-engine ferry sortie must be approved by MAJCOM/A3/DO. The owning
MAJCOM will provide execution authority for these sorties. As directed by the appropriate
MAJCOM only highly qualified crewmembers from MAJCOM/A3/A3V, NAF/DOV or unit
OG/OGV will conduct three-engine ferry flights. The following procedures apply:
   4.8.1. Plan ferry operations well ahead to allow sufficient time for completion of
   maintenance preparation actions. Plan the flight to the nearest destination possessing a usable
   maintenance support capability. Obtain clearances and alert all en route, alternate, and abort
   bases along the intended route of flight.
   4.8.2. The PIC shall abide by aircraft flight manual and technical order 1C-135(K)(I)-1, 1C-
   135(K)R(II)-1, 1C-135(K)-1, 1C-135, 1C-135(K)R(I)-1, and 1C-135(K)R-1-1 limitations.
   4.8.3. The aircraft MEL (T.O. 1C-135(K)A-1-2), does not apply. All primary aircraft
   systems not specifically associated with the failed engine must be fully operational.
   4.8.4. Download cargo (including mission support kits) prior to ferry operations. Return all
   cargo and support equipment to the main operating base of assignment via organic support
   aircraft or other airlift means.
   4.8.5. Use the minimum crew necessary for the ferry operation. A maximum of two crew
   chiefs (one 7-skill level) may be added. Do not carry passengers or other non-essential
   personnel.
   4.8.6. Performance data must satisfy takeoff field length requirements, gear down 3-engine
   climb performance, and final segment two-engine asymmetric go-around capability.
4.9. Gear Down Flight Operations. Limit gear down flight operations to sorties required to
move the aircraft to a suitable repair facility. Consider gear down flight only after the PIC
exhausts all avenues to repair the aircraft in place.
   4.9.1. Standard climb-out flight path charts in T.O. 1C-135(K)R-1-1 do not account for a
   gear- down configuration. Therefore, PICs shall not takeoff until there is reasonable
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                             71


   assurance that they will achieve/maintain adequate obstacle clearance (to include en route
   stops and alternates).
   4.9.2. Time and communications capability permitting, validate takeoff data with MAJCOM
   Stan/Eval or unit OG/OGV.
4.10. Power Management Control (PMC) Operations. The PIC may (authorize) takeoff with
one PMC inoperative. Do not turn off an operational PMC to practice a PMC inoperative takeoff.
Simulated three-engine approaches and touch-and-go landings are not authorized with a PMC
inoperative.

                               OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished. Momentary
hesitations for coordination items, Red Ball MX, ATC interruptions and deviations specified in
the flight manual, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may
be added to the checklists. Currency of notes is a crewmember’s responsibility.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM/A3V and the AFMC Flight Manual Manager are the
   checklist insert approval authorities. Send checklist inserts to MAJCOM/A3V, who will in
   turn coordinate with AFMC for approval. All checklist inserts must have a POC. OGVs shall
   approve local in- flight guides and inserts not affecting T.O. guidance and procedures.
   5.1.2. Abbreviated checklists items that do not apply to the unit’s aircraft or mission may be
   lined out.
   5.1.3. Crewmembers may use the most current version of applicable fanfold checklists in
   lieu of abbreviated checklists. Fanfold checklists must be current and contain all applicable
   basic flight manual supplement information.
5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots shall be in their seats during flight. One of them may be out of
their seat for brief periods to meet physiological needs. With both pilots in their seats, PICs may
authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station during non-critical phases of
flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert). The PIC, pilot/copilot, BO and navigator (if
applicable) will be at their duty stations during all critical phases of flight. The BO primary duty
station will be the navigator station when no navigator is on board.
5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight
station during all phases of flight; the total number of persons permitted is limited to the number
of seats with operable seat belts and oxygen. Passengers and observers will not be permitted
access to pilot or co-pilot positions.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left
or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-code) is not required to
occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
   5.4.1. An AC or IP will make all takeoffs and landings during emergencies and heavyweight
   landings approved by a waiver, unless conditions prevent compliance.
   5.4.2. Unless the other pilot in the seat is a certified AC or higher, pilots in command (PIC)
   with less than 100 primary assigned aircraft (PAA) hours since AC certification will make all
   takeoffs and landings under any of the following conditions:
       5.4.2.1. Ceiling/visibility less than 300 feet and 3/4 SM visibility (1200 m) and/or RVR
       of 4,000 FT (1200 m).
       5.4.2.2. RCR equivalent to less than a wet runway.
       5.4.2.3. Crosswind component greater than 15 knots.

5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The pilot flying (PF) will command
configuration changes. The pilot monitoring (PM) will verify appropriate airspeed and
configuration prior to actuating the gear or flaps.
5.6. Outside Observer/Jump Seat Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing
during taxi operations, receiver AAR, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet AGL.
5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt.
   5.7.2. Crewmembers will have seat belts fastened when occupying a duty position, unless
   crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.7.3. All crewmembers will have seat belts and shoulder harnesses fastened during takeoff
   and landing. For air refueling and tactical operations, all crewmembers and passengers will
   have seat belts and shoulder harness fastened, if accessible (unless authorized by the PIC or
   crew duties dictate otherwise). Crewmembers performing instructor or flight examiner duties
   are exempt from seat belt requirements if not occupying a primary crew position; however,
   they will have a seat available with an operable seat belt.
   5.7.4. Litter patients, actual or simulated, must remain secured on litters for taxi, takeoff,
   AAR, landing.
   5.7.5. Crew bunks will not be occupied during taxi, takeoff, landing, air refueling operations,

NOTES:
(1) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around.
(2) With weather at CAT 1 minimums on a CAT 1 ILS, the pilot may not see the runway
environment at DH; however, the initial portion of the approach lights may be visible. The
pilot may continue to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights only. The pilot may not
descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference
unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.
(3) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue, or go-around. Respond with
the intention to land if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight throughout touchdown
and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
(4) If the pilot flying has stated “landing” then this call is not required.
(5) Refer to stabilized approach criteria in paragraph 5.12.

5.12. Stabilized Approach. Unstable approaches are primary contributors to numerous military
and civilian mishaps. Stabilized approaches are essential for the safe operation of aircraft and are
mandatory. The following criteria define specific parameters that mitigate risk during this critical
phase of flight. This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate corrective actions to stabilize
the approach when outside designated parameters.
    5.12.1. The following criteria apply to all approaches:
        5.12.1.1. At 1000 feet AGL:
            5.12.1.1.1. Aircraft is in approach configuration. Circling configuration is acceptable
            for circling approaches. NOTE: In those cases where VFR traffic pattern is 1,000 feet
            AGL (as opposed to 1,500 feet), the aircraft will be configured for landing prior to
            commencing the base turn to final.
            5.12.1.1.2. Airspeed is appropriate for the configuration and conditions.
            5.12.1.1.3. Sink rate is no greater than 1000 fpm. NOTE: Under certain conditions
            (WX, Threats, Terrain, etc.) some IAPs and Tactical Approaches may require greater
            than a 1000 fpm descent rate.
                5.12.1.1.3.1. Non-precision Approaches. Pilots should calculate a constant
                descent gradient profile from the FAF altitude to the VDP (IAW AFMAN 11-
                217V1, Instrument Flight Procedures). This is considered the safest profile and
                should be used to the max extent possible. During a go-around, ensure descent
                below the MDA does not occur.
            5.12.1.1.4. All briefings and checklists are complete unless contrary to T.O.
            guidance.
            5.12.1.1.5. Aircraft is on the correct track.
            5.12.1.1.6. Aircraft in the correct bank angle to maintain proper approach track for
            instrument, circling, or visual/tactical approach.
            5.12.1.1.7. Power set to maintain the descent profile at approach speed.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                77


         5.12.1.1.8. If these criteria are not met by 1000 feet AGL, the PM will announce the
         deviation and the PF will take immediate corrective action. PM states “1000 xxxx,”
         where “xxxx” equates to a concise description of the unstable characteristic(s) which
         clearly relay to the PF what actions are required to return the aircraft to a stable
         platform. Examples: “1000, fast,” or “1000, half dot low”. If criteria are met, PM
         will simply state “1000.”
     5.12.1.2. From 500 AGL to the runway, if these parameters are exceeded the PM will
     announce “Go-Around” and the PF will execute a go-around/missed approach. If criteria
     for stable approach are met, the PM will state “500.”
         5.12.1.2.1. Parameters are the same as those at 1000 feet AGL.
         5.12.1.2.2. If unstable at 500’ crews should perform a go-around.
     5.12.1.3. From 300’ AGL to the runway, if these parameters are exceeded the PM will
     announce “Go-Around” and the PF will execute a go-around/missed approach. If criteria
     for stable approach are met, the PM will state “300’, Stable.”
         5.12.1.3.1. Momentary minor corrections or deviations are acceptable and defined as:
             5.12.1.3.1.1. Airspeed: +10/-5 knots from target
             5.12.1.3.1.2. Bank Angle: +/- 15 degrees
             5.12.1.3.1.3. Rate of Descent: +/- 300 FPM from target
  5.12.2. Descent Planning and Energy Management. Aircrews will ensure the aircraft is
  following the planned descent profile. All non-tactical descents should follow a normal
  descent profile IAW AFMAN 11-217V1 procedures and techniques in the absence of ATC
  or FLIP guidance. All tactical descents should follow published tactical procedures/profiles.
  When unforeseen interruptions alter the planned descent, immediately correct any deviations.
  It may be necessary to hold, request vectors, or take alternate actions in order to comply with
  the planned descent profile.
  5.12.3. Visual Transition. It is imperative for aircrews to review the airfield environment.
  Identify key features such as approach light type, airfield lighting, geographic
  layout/configuration of runways, taxiways, ramps, etc. To the max extent possible, this study
  will take place during the crew mission briefing and reviewed again prior to descent.
  5.12.4. Missed Approach/Go-Around. Aircrews will conduct a thorough briefing for
  anticipated missed approach/go-around scenarios. This briefing will include a discussion of
  specific crewmember duties.
  5.12.5. FTUs only. FTUs will fully emphasize and train so as to ensure the final product
  complies with all aspects of stabilized approach criterion. However, the building block
  approach used to properly execute both tactical and non-tactical approach/landings for
  initial/upgrade training requires that instructors have the latitude to use their expertise and
  experience to deviate from stabilized approach guidance. FTU instructors are expected to use
  good judgment, technique and latitude while developing student skills and therefore are
  relieved of strict compliance to the stabilized approach criterion during appropriate
  instructional scenarios.

5.13. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to
aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to
maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.13.1. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical
   phases of flight. Crewmembers will advise the PF before checking off interphone.
   Crewmembers will ensure personnel on headset, or within listening distance, are cleared
   prior to discussing classified information over interphone. Use the erase function of the CVR
   after classified discussions.
   5.13.2. Command Radios.
      5.13.2.1. The PM normally makes all air traffic control (ATC) radio calls.
      5.13.2.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the ATC frequency
      unless directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2 frequencies
      on the inbound and outbound legs.
      5.13.2.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary ATC,
      and update the crew when the primary ATC radio changes.
      5.13.2.4. One pilot should record and read back all ATC clearances; the navigator or
      boom operator (if applicable/available) will monitor the read back and will ensure
      compliance with all clearances.
      5.13.2.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the
      maximum extent possible. EXCEPTION: Only one crewmember is required to monitor
      guard frequencies during tanker or receiver rendezvous and AAR.
      5.13.2.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
      unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
      5.13.2.7. Aircrews will use navigation charts to identify radio frequency changeover
      points to minimize the likelihood of prolonged loss of communication (PLOC) with
      ATC/radio operators.
      5.13.2.8. In the event of known or suspected loss of two-way radio capability, aircrews
      shall change their transponder mode 3/A to 7600. Squawking 7600 highlights the loss of
      two-way radio capability to ATC/radio operators and minimizes the risk of being
      intercepted. Past experience shows aircrews often hear transmissions from other aircraft,
      but not the associated ground ATC exchanges. Therefore, it is recommended that in all
      cases of suspected loss of contact with ATC, aircrews attempt to use other aircraft to
      relay messages to ATC controllers.
      5.13.2.9. Aircrews experiencing a prolonged loss of contact event will complete a PLOC
      questionnaire found at: https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/docs/publication_537.doc. E-
      mail completed questionnaires to AMC.A3V@scott.af.mil or fax to DSN (312) 576-
      5692.
5.14. Crew Resource Management (CRM)/Threat and Error Management.
   5.14.1. Threat and Error Management provides strategies and tactics to help crews target
   threats to safe flight operations and decreases the potential for crew error. External threats are
   events that occur outside the influence of the flight crew and require crew attention and
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  79


   management to maintain adequate safety margins. Internal threats are crew related and are
   factors that could lead to an error if not recognized and controlled.
   5.14.2. “Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use
   of "Time Out" will:
      5.14.2.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
      5.14.2.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
      5.14.2.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew departing from
      established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply uncomfortable
      with the developing conditions.
      5.14.2.4. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take
      the following actions:
      5.14.2.5. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft.
      5.14.2.6. The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew.
      5.14.2.7. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
      inputs relative to the stated concerns.
      5.14.2.8. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
      current course of action or direct a new course of action.
   5.14.3. Sterile Cockpit. With the exception of cruise flight, conversation below 10,000’ MSL
   will be limited to mission, departure, or approach essential items. Every effort will be made
   to accomplish briefings and appropriate checklists prior to top of descent (TOD). Sterile
   cockpit procedures also apply during taxi and air refueling operations.
   5.14.4. Heads-up/Heads-down. Any crewmember that observes both pilots heads-down at
   the same time (other than heads-down instrument flying) shall alert the PF without delay.
   5.14.5. Critical Action Coordination. Those actions that are flight critical/irreversible in
   nature and should always be confirmed by two crew members. These actions include, but are
   not limited to, placing the throttle to cutoff, pulling the engine fire handle, pressing the
   extinguisher switch, and dumping fuel. The crew member performing the action points to the
   affected switch/handle and verbally seeks confirmation from a second crew member
   (i.e.”CONFIRM NUMBER ONE”). The crew member confirming the action looks at the
   affected switch/handle and acknowledges (i.e.”NUMBER ONE CONFIRMED”).
5.15. Use of Automation.
   5.15.1. General Automation Procedures. There must be a clear understanding of the PF and
   the Pilot Monitoring (PM) duties at all times. Aircrews are expected to fly the aircraft using
   the highest level of automation, balanced with the requirement to maintain basic flying skills.
   However, Pilots are authorized to choose an appropriate level of automation consistent with
   changing flight environments. If the use of automation creates a loss of situational awareness
   or results in task saturation, shift to a less demanding level or disconnect the automation
   entirely and re-establish desired aircraft path and control.
 80                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   5.15.2. Verbalize, Verify, and Monitor (VVM) is a closed-loop system of communication
   designed to significantly reduce typical automation selection errors between the PF and PM.
   VVM consists of the following three step process:
      5.15.2.1. Prior to making any changes in the FMS, altitude alerter, autopilot, fuel panel,
      etc., the pilot making the entries will VERBALIZE the intended changes.
      5.15.2.2. Both pilots will VERIFY the intended changes prior to execution.
      5.15.2.3. Both pilots will MONITOR the aircraft to ensure the expected performance is
      achieved.
      5.15.2.4. The PF will announce changes to the level of automation, flight director and
      autopilot mode selections, and mode transitions to the maximum extent possible. The PM
      will acknowledge the call.
5.16. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) in conjunction with the
sponsor’s permanent change of station is authorized. Other pets or animals are normally
prohibited, but may be moved according to DoD 4515.13R, Air Transportation Eligibility.
5.17. Alcoholic Beverages. The MAJCOM/A3/DO or NAF/CC may authorize the dispensing
of alcoholic beverages.
5.18. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements.
   5.18.1. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Requirements. Minimum runway length is 7,000
   feet. Minimum runway width is 147 feet. Minimum taxiway width is 74 feet.
   5.18.2. Runway Length for Takeoff and Landing. Do not takeoff if computed critical field
   length exceeds runway available. Minimum runway for a normal landing is landing distance
   based on a threshold crossing height of 50 feet.
      5.18.2.1. Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the PF will initiate takeoffs from the
      beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway. The decision to make
      intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.
      5.18.2.2. Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs provided the operating
      environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows a safe
      takeoff and departure. Calculate takeoff performance based on the runway remaining
      from the point at which the takeoff is initiated. In no case will a takeoff be made from a
      position where less than 7000 feet of runway remains.
      5.18.2.3. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, base takeoff
      computations on the reported runway surface condition (RSC) or RCR for the cleared
      portion of the runway. A minimum of 50 feet either side of centerline should be cleared.
      If 50 feet either side of centerline is not cleared, compute takeoff data based on the un-
      cleared portion up to 50 feet either side of centerline.
      5.18.2.4. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are stressed and authorized for
      normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff.
      Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing if
      needed.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                81


      5.18.2.5. Crews will normally use 0.80 delayed braking factor (DBF) for computing
      landing distance. PIC’s may direct using up to 0.90 DBF as an exception on a case by
      case basis, but must be aware of the resultant increase in brake wear. OG/CC or
      equivalent approval is required for landings with greater than a 0.90 DBF. When using
      greater than 0.80 DBF crews will brief the planned braking speed.
   5.18.3. Arresting Cables.
      5.18.3.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include
      recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower
      to have the cable inspected.
      5.18.3.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
      slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automated terminal information service
      (ATIS), or ATC.
      5.18.3.3. Operations are authorized on runways where BAK-12 systems with an eight-
      point cable tie-down system is installed. When operating from runways equipped with
      other types of systems, or if it is unknown whether the BAK-12 system includes eight-
      point tie-downs, aircrews should recognize the increased risk of damage to the aircraft.
   5.18.4. Other Airfield Requirements.
      5.18.4.1. Consult with HQ AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) for suitability
      guidance. Airfield certification requirements are detailed in the ASRR.
      5.18.4.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A3AS for all questions
      pertaining to airfield weight bearing capacity and will review the GDSS (when available)
      and ASRR before all off-station operations. HQ AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the
      restrictions in GDSS Giant Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained aircraft unless
      specifically delegated in AFI 11-2KC-135 Vol 3. Direct GDSS Giant Report and ASRR
      waiver requests to HQ AMC/A3AS. HQ AMC/A3V is the OPR for waivers to airfield
      operating restrictions (runway length, width, etc.). MAJCOM/A3/DO is the waiver
      authority for non-AMC missions. The PIC is responsible for waiver compliance. Crews
      that have access to the World Wide Web will review airfield suitability in the GDSS
      airfield database. Consult the ASRR for airfield certification requirements.
      5.18.4.3. Operations from RAF Fairford and RAF Mildenhall. An RCR 15 may be used
      for computing takeoff performance for all operational and training missions when wet
      runway conditions exist. This authorization does not apply to landing data computations
      or when standing water is on the runway. Determination of standing water versus wet
      runway conditions will be made by the 100 OG/CC.
   5.18.5. RCR Limitations. When no RCR is available, the PIC will refer to the flight manual
   for standard ICAO conversions based on general runway condition. Normally, RCR values
   are not reported for taxiways and ramps. During periods of reported low RCR, the taxiways
   and ramps may have an even lower RCR than reported for the runway. The runway surface
   should be considered wet when water on the runway causes a reflective glare.
5.19. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) Avoidance.
 82                                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   5.19.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
   monitoring clearance between aircraft and obstructions. With wing walkers, avoid taxi
   obstructions by at least 10 feet from any obstruction. EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218,
   aircraft may taxi without marshallers/wing walkers at home station along locally established
   taxi lines which have been measured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any
   obstruction and the obstruction is permanent. Adjacent aircraft are also considered a
   permanent obstruction, provided the aircraft is parked properly in its designated spot and is
   not moving. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are considered a permanent
   obstruction, provided it is parked entirely within a designated area. Areas will be designated
   by permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines on the ramp or another suitable means.
   5.19.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   unavailable, deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and
   provide marshaling using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned crewmembers, or
   a crewmember on interphone to act as an observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways.
   During night taxi operations, marshallers will have an illuminated wand in each hand. Wing
   walkers are only required to have one illuminated wand. Observers should be in a position to
   see wing walkers at all times (through door or windows) and communicate with the pilot.
   5.19.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.
   Crews should:
      5.19.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout paying particular attention to taxi routes, turn
      requirements, and areas for potential FOD.
          5.19.3.1.1. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
          5.19.3.1.2. Where possible, avoid taxi operations that position an engine over an
          unprepared or un-swept surface. If unavoidable, leave the engine in idle (to the
          maximum extent possible) until the engine is over an improved surface.
5.20. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
   5.20.1. Aircrews should consider burning down fuel versus jettison, unless safety of flight
   dictates an immediate jettison (as determined by the pilot in command). Except in the case of
   an emergency, before jettisoning fuel, notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility of
   intentions, altitude, and location. If available, the PIC will use designated jettison areas,
   except when safety of flight would be compromised.
   5.20.2. For missions tasked by higher headquarters C2 agencies, the tasking C2 agency may
   authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational requirement dictates immediate recovery
   and reconstitution of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The tasking C2 agency may provide fuel
   jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive, SPINS, etc.
   5.20.3. For training missions, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettison when an urgent
   operational requirement exists to expedite recovery of the aircraft and all alternatives have
   been exhausted.
   5.20.4. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel
   jettisoning. Ideally, establish jettison areas at altitudes above 20,000 feet above ground level,
   off published airways, avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply sources.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                   83


   Avoid circling descents. Initiate AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis,
   and submit it to the base environmental coordinator.
   5.20.5. All fuel jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the PIC
   immediately after landing using a MAJCOM approved form for unusual occurrence or
   inflight emergency. Submit completed form to unit Safety. Document all pertinent
   information, including the following items:
       5.20.5.1. Scheduled duration.
       5.20.5.2. Actual duration.
       5.20.5.3. Landing gross weight.
       5.20.5.4. Computed stopping distance.
       5.20.5.5. Recovery field.
       5.20.5.6. Runway available.
       5.20.5.7. Jettison altitude/location.
       5.20.5.8. Jettison amount.
       5.20.5.9. Reason for jettison.
       5.20.5.10. Approval authority.
   5.20.6. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel
   jettisoning. Ideally, establish jettison areas at altitudes above 20,000 feet above ground level,
   off published airways, avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply sources.
   Avoid circling descents. Initiate AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis,
   and submit it to the base environmental coordinator.
5.21. Aircraft Speed. Comply with requirements established in AFI 11-202V3. IAW
applicable tech orders, aircraft may exceed 250 KIAS or in-flight minimum maneuver speed
below 10,000 feet to safely accomplish formation departure rejoins. Once rejoined, all formation
aircraft may exceed 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet only to accommodate the minimum maneuver
speed of the heaviest formation aircraft.
5.22. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following
procedures:
   5.22.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
       5.22.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
       5.22.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
       only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic
       pattern activity is prohibited.
       5.22.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
       Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver is
       required to operate at airfields not controlled by the MAF.
 84                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   5.22.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
   migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs and
   landings from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the Phase II period.
   Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR Supplement along
   with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions.
   5.22.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, a PIC has the authority
   to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the appropriate C2
   authority.
   5.22.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ
   AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized Continental United
   States (CONUS) bird migration patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software
   overlay, and the latest news. The Avian Hazard Advisory system (AHAS) website is another
   source for real time bird hazard information. Both sites may be accessed through the AMC
   aircrew mission planning portal. See AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard
   (BASH) Management Techniques, for additional information.
   5.22.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit, or as
   practicable, to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike
   damage cannot be accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a
   complex airborne emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can
   make reliable damage assessments.
5.23. Functional Check Flights (FCFs), Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs) and Operational
Check Flights (OCFs). Check flights will be accomplished IAW T.O. 1C-135-6, Aircraft
Scheduled Inspections and Maintenance Requirements, AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
Maintenance Management, T.O. 1-1-300, Functional Check Flights and Maintenance
Operational Checks, and T.O. 1C-135-6CF-1, Acceptance and/or Functional Check Procedures
Manual. Crews should only perform tasks or functions contained in specific Technical Order
guidance. If requested to perform a non-standard function, PICs should contact their OG/CC to
see if an FCF applies.
   5.23.1. FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300 and AFI 21-101.
   5.23.2. The OG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to FCF
   procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent waivers
   require MAJCOM/A3/DO approval IAW Chapter 1.
   5.23.3. The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program. Publish additional guidance in
   local supplement to this instruction. The OG/CC may authorize a partial FCF to check only
   those systems disturbed by maintenance, an inspection or modification.
   5.23.4. Conduct check flights within the designated check flight airspace of the base from
   which the flight was launched except when the flight must be conducted under specific
   conditions, not compatible with local conditions and area restrictions.
   5.23.5. The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility of the
   MAJCOM/A3/DO.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  85


   5.23.6. The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF crewmembers.
   The OG/CC will determine FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM assessment for that
   specific FCF flight.
   5.23.7. Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC. OG/CCs may authorize a flight under a
   combination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all systems are
   operating properly, the crew may proceed IFR through cloud cover to “VFR on Top” for the
   altitude phase of the flight.
   5.23.8. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the MXG/CC may subsequently release the
   aircraft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the condition generating the
   FCF, and the original condition operationally checked good.
   5.23.9. Only FCF crews shall perform high-speed taxi checks. Perform checks IAW the
   flight manual and maintenance technical orders. Prepare the aircraft with minimum fuel
   necessary to accomplish the check to limit brake/tire wear, (ensure fuel on board will permit
   a safe return to base should the aircraft unexpectedly become airborne) and turn on the anti-
   skid system. The PIC will calculate takeoff data for the highest speed planned and ensure
   runway available allows sufficient stopping distance for existing conditions without
   exceeding normal brake energy limits.
5.24. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation in Aerial
Events, AFI 11-246V6, Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations, and the appropriate MAJCOM
supplement. The CONOPS implementing AFI 11-246V6 and associated documents are available
at:
https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/a3/A3O/O/Airshows%20and%20Aerial%20Events/default.aspx.
5.25. Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow
resolution advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow
the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. Pilots who deviate from an
ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and
promptly return to the ATC clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new
clearance.
   5.25.1. Operate the TCAS with sensitivity set to Traffic Advisory/Resolution Advisory
   (TA/RA) at all times except when in cell formation, during air refueling, or when operational
   necessity dictates.
5.26. Not Used.
5.27. Not Used.
5.28. Not Used.
5.29. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews will not normally attempt to
recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground
crews will accomplish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may
only accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and
the PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities
through 618 AOC (TACC), or appropriate C2 agency.
5.30. Not Used.
 86                                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


5.31. Not Used.
5.32. Aircrew Fatigue. It is the crewmember’s responsibility to be properly rested for each
mission. However, if circumstances prevent this, no MAF/AMC crewmember should feel
pressured to fly when not properly rested. A crewmember who is fatigued shall immediately
notify the aircraft commander, if unable to start or complete a mission safely. Declaring “Safety
of Flight” may be required in this situation.
5.33. Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP). The Military Aviation Safety Action Program
is an identity-protected, self-reporting system modeled after successful FAA/Airline programs to
encourage the voluntary reporting Operational issues and events. It is designed to provide a non-
punitive environment for the open reporting of safety concerns and information that might be
critical to identifying hazardous situations and precursors to accidents. These safety concerns
may be either observed or experienced by the submitter. The goal is to prevent mishaps by
addressing those unintentional errors, hazardous situations and events, or high-risk activities not
identified and/or correctable by other methods or through traditional safety reporting sources.
The ASAP website is accessible at www.safety-masap.com. Crewmembers can contact the
AMC ASAP program manager via email at amc.asap@scott.af.mil.
5.34. Not Used.
5.35. Terminal Area RNAV Procedures. Properly trained KC-135 aircrews are authorized to
perform IFR RNAV operations to include instrument departures, arrivals, and approaches using
LNAV minima.
   5.35.1. For departure and arrival procedures based on traditional ground-based NAVAIDs in
   the NAS and constructed by a US government TERPs authority (USAF/FAA/USN), FMS
   NAV mode may be used as the sole source for navigation with the following restrictions:
       5.35.1.1. All terminal RNAV procedures must be retrieved from the navigation database.
       5.35.1.2. RNAV procedures will not be flown with an expired database.
       5.35.1.3. Pilots will tune, identify, monitor and display the appropriate ground-based
       NAVAIDs whenever practicable.
   5.35.2. GPS overlays of conventional SIDs and STARs found in the aircraft database are
   only authorized for situational awareness and require the pilots to use the ground based
   navaids as their primary navigational source, where RNAV SIDs and STARs do not require
   the use of ground based navaids.
   5.35.3. When flying RNAV SIDs KC-135 crews will accomplish a gyro takeoff and ensure
   pilot flying’s primary course as a minimum is set to FMS. The crew will ensure the flight
   directors are set to NAV/LOC to provide flight director guidance prior to reaching 500 feet
   AGL, IAW FAA Advisory Circular 90-100A, U.S Terminal and En Route Area Navigation
   (RNAV) Operations.
   5.35.4. Flight director lateral guidance must be available anytime the KC-135 is operating in
   RNP 0.3 airspace.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 87

   6.2.10. AF Form 1199, Air Force Entry Control Card.
6.3. Pre-mission Actions.
   6.3.1. Before transiting areas outside the CONUS, aircrews will review and obtain theater-
   specific information necessary to successfully operate there. The review, at a minimum,
   should include the planning documents AFI 11-202V3, AFTTP 3-3.KC-135, and the
   following:
      6.3.1.1. Tasking, itinerary, and altitude reservation (ALTRV) requirements.
      6.3.1.2. Applicable OPORD, SPINS, Risk Assessment Database (RAD), Country Risk
      Assessment (CRA), and FLIP. Obtain and carry this information, if required.
      6.3.1.3. FCG for areas of operation (to include classified portion). Obtain necessary
      diplomatic clearances where required.
   6.3.2. Obtain required customs forms.
   6.3.3. Obtain worldwide FLIP, DAFIF, and sufficient communications security (COMSEC)
   materials for the duration of the mission.

AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 89


   6.3.8. Passenger Restrictions. Release space available seats to the maximum extent possible
   unless overriding safety, legal or security concerns prohibit space available travelers from
   flying on specific missions. The only passengers on missions transporting DVs will be those
   of the official party and those space available passengers authorized by the lead POC for the
   traveling party. Authorization must be approved 24 hours in advance.
       6.3.8.1. Space Available Passengers. For other than revenue and White House missions,
       PICs are authorized to release space available seats on mission legs when no official
       passengers are aboard (positioning and de-positioning legs). Coordinate with C2 agency
       to release available seats to the passenger terminal. PICs are encouraged to release
       maximum space available seats subject to the following restrictions:
           6.3.8.1.1. Revenue Missions. These are missions for which the using agency
           (typically a government agency other than DoD) is reimbursing DoD for use of the
           aircraft. Space available passengers on revenue missions must be approved 24 hours
           in advance by USAF/ CVAM, theater AMD or JOSAC (as appropriate) and the using
           agency contact officer through unit C2 agencies. This is essential to ensure proper
           funding and reimbursement. Consult C2 to determine mission revenue status if in
           doubt. Congressional Delegations (CODEL) are not revenue missions.
           6.3.8.1.2. White House Support Missions. Space available passengers will generally
           not be permitted aboard White House support mission aircraft without express
           permission of HQ USAF/CVAM. This is normally due to the security status of the
           aircraft, which may include positioning and de-positioning legs. When it is necessary
           to move aircrew members or support personnel on White House support mission
           aircraft, the WHMO will be advised and permission obtained through the unit C2 and
           CVAM. On de-positioning legs space available passengers will usually be permitted
           if the aircraft is no longer required to maintain an upgraded security status.
           6.3.8.1.3. Billing. Space available passengers on revenue missions may be subject to
           being billed commercial first-class airfare by the using agency for the applicable
           route, depending on that agency's policy. If the DV or on-board contact officer
           releases seats, aircraft commander must ensure that any additional financial liability
           for the passengers is specified by the using agency on-board contact officer. PIC will
           ensure passengers understand and agree to any reimbursement conditions prior to
           boarding.
   6.3.9. Ensure the correct aircraft navigation database is loaded or will be carried, as
   appropriate.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. Primary crewmembers will carry (or have in-flight
access to) the publications specified in Table 6.1 on all missions. Cargo loading publications are
required for cargo loading/unloading operations. Units may specify additional publications in
their local unit supplement to this instruction. Reference AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals
Program, for guidance on electronic publications.

6.5. Airfield Review. Aircrews will consult the web-based airfield database maintained by HQ
AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) and comply with the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR for updates
to airfield operability and weight bearing capability. Refer to AFI 11-202V3 Chapter 8 for non-
US Government published instrument approach procedures (including commercially-produced
procedures).
6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing. Aircrews will receive an intelligence briefing that will
emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military development in the area in which
they will be flying. Obtain timely intelligence updates prior to entering a specific area of
operations (AOR). In theater, aircrews should receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a
forward operating location (FOL), or en route stop, and thereafter when significant developments
occur. Report information of possible intelligence value to the local intelligence office as soon
as practical to ensure timely dissemination of mission reports (MISREPs).

Section 6B—Pre-Departure

6.7. Global Decision Scheduling System 2 (GDSS2) Account. Pilots will obtain a GDSS
account prior to operating on IFM-planned sorties. Download aircrew departure papers using the
GDSS account, at locations without an AMC C2 presence. For operational missions, ensure
GDSS account passwords are active prior to departing home station.
6.8. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF).
   6.8.1. Crewmembers will review FCIF Volume 1 before all missions or ground aircrew
   duties, and update the FCIF currency record with the latest FCIF item number, date, and
   crewmember's initials.
       6.8.1.1. Electronic signatures (PEX or equivalent program) are the primary means of
       FCIF Sign- Off.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                              91


   6.8.2. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF review or joining a mission en route will receive an
   FCIF update from a primary aircrew member counterpart on the mission.
   6.8.3. Crewmembers not assigned or attached to the unit operating a mission will certify
   FCIF review by entering the last FCIF number and their initials after their name on the file
   copy of the flight authorization or file copy of their crew orders. This applies to all
   crewmembers if the electronic sign-in system is not working at show time.
6.9. Flight Crew Bulletins (FCB). Items in the FCB may include local procedures and policies
concerning equipment and personnel generally not found in any other publications.
6.10. Mission Kits. Carry mission kits on all missions away from home station. Publications
and forms may be maintained and carried electronically provided operable in-flight viewing or
printing capability exists. Suggested items include: NOTE: *Indicates mandatory for all AOC
(TACC) or AMC missions away from home station and as directed by C2 authority.

6.12. Briefing Requirements.
   6.12.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The PIC will contact the local C2 agency to confirm
   mission requirements. The PIC and controlling agency jointly share responsibility to identify
   special briefing requirements. Briefings may include buffer zone, electronic warfare
   activities, SAFE PASSAGE, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), diplomatic clearance,
   hazardous cargo, anti-hijacking procedures, operations and safety supplements to flight
   manuals, and OPORD procedure.
   6.12.2. Pilot in Command Briefing Pre-Departure Briefing. Cover all applicable items of the
   operations briefing, including MAJCOM, NAF, and unit special interest items (SII), CRM,
   and ORM levels and mitigating factors. Brief crewmembers on the specific mission details if
   not previously accomplished. Use a MAJCOM approved briefing guide.
       6.12.2.1. Pilot in Command Enroute Briefing. In the en route system, the PIC will ensure
       that an aircrew briefing is conducted prior to the first sortie of the day. As a minimum,
       brief crewmembers on specific mission details for that day's sortie(s), CRM, and the
       ORM level and mitigating factors for the mission. Complete this briefing prior to engine
       start.
       6.12.2.2. Not Used.
   6.12.3. Specialized Briefing. Use specialized briefings to detail operating procedures or SIIs
   peculiar to various crew positions, and to answer questions relating to those specialties.
   Specialized briefings review formation tactics and procedures, AAR information, and
94                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


  technical instructions for specialized equipment operations. All crewmembers should attend
  each briefing. Crewmembers may only be excused from specialized briefings for pre-flight
  duties; however the PIC will back brief all appropriate items. Use a MAJCOM approved
  specialized briefing guide.
  6.12.4. Weather Briefings. The PIC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and
  forecast for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The PIC will brief primary
  crewmembers on appropriate weather conditions before departure.
     6.12.4.1. Aircrews flying flight-managed sorties will use the weather briefing provided
     with the IFM aircrew departure papers. This weather briefing satisfies requirement for
     paragraph 6.12.4. Local weather flights/agencies may update local takeoff weather data,
     but aircrews, working through their flight manager/dispatcher, will use 618 AOC
     (TACC) weather operations (or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) supporting the
     theater C2 Agency) as the final arbiter for weather-related issues and further updates.
     6.12.4.2. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather
     information from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at
     their location.
     6.12.4.3. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home
     weather flight, OWS, or 618 AOC (TACC) weather operations, obtain weather through
     any means available prior to mission accomplishment.
     6.12.4.4. Weather information is preferred from US Military weather services but
     permitted from any FAA-approved weather source or host nation civil or military weather
     source.
     6.12.4.5. Verbal weather briefings are authorized for local flights. Face-to-face briefings
     are not required.
  6.12.5. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within or adjacent to an established buffer
  zone, the PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone
  procedures outlined in appropriate directives.
  6.12.6. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with
  peacetime and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft.
  6.12.7. IFM Briefing. PICs will thoroughly review the aircrew departure papers provided for
  IFM sorties. The PIC, or designated representative, will contact the flight manager if there
  are discrepancies with the departure papers or to resolve any questions before signing the
  flight plan.
  6.12.8. Training/Evaluation      Briefing.   Before    all     training/evaluation   missions,
  instructors/flight examiners (for each crew position) will brief the crew on requirements and
  objectives for each student or examinee.
  6.12.9. Intelligence Briefings. Before operating in a combat environment, the crew will
  obtain a current intelligence briefing.
  6.12.10. Post-Mission Debrief. PICs will use the AMC Debrief Guide in conjunction with
  MDS- specific guides tailored for specific mission variables (e.g. tactics, formation, etc.)
  upon sortie/simulator completion.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                     95


6.13. Call Signs.
   6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a 2-
   digit suffix assigned by the parent unit.
   6.13.2. Operational Missions. Use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic
   clearance. If no call sign has been assigned, use unit static call signs. When flying AMC
   channel missions, and no other call sign has been assigned, use the “REACH” call sign
   followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft
   tail number (or as required by diplomatic clearance). To complete flight plans, put the letters
   "RCH" followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the
   aircraft tail number.
   6.13.3. The Reach 01 and 18 call signs are reserved for the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC.
   6.13.4. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). For actual AE missions, use the call sign “Evac"
   followed by the five-digit aircraft number (example, Evac 12345) or mission designator.
   Refer to FLIP GP Chapter 4. When the AE portion of the mission is completed, normal call
   signs will be used. This does not alleviate the responsibility to use diplomatically cleared call
   signs when required.
6.14. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation.
6.15. Flight Plan Data Entry and Verification.
   6.15.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance,
   navigation, and climatic data, including en route wind information. If stand-alone computer
   based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Use only
   MAJCOM validated CFPs.
       6.15.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually
       compute flight plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and
       diplomatic clearance compliance.
       6.15.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.
       Pass any flight plan discrepancies to the C2 Flight Planning Office. On IFM sorties,
       promptly notify the flight manager of any flight plan discrepancies, to ensure the correct
       route of flight is filed with air traffic control. Identify inaccurate CFP winds to 618 AOC
       (TACC)/XOCM if the average wind for a route segment at planned altitude exceeds
       either 30° error in direction or 25 knots in speed.
   6.15.2. For flight plans not constructed using MAJCOM approved software, verify all
   waypoint data using one or more of the following methods:
       6.15.2.1. Latitude/longitude from current FLIP.
       6.15.2.2. Bearing/distance from a flight plan after latitude/longitude are verified for each
       waypoint.
       6.15.2.3. Ground Based NAVAIDs.
 96                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   6.15.3. The following procedure will be utilized anytime flight plan waypoints are entered
   into the FMS and will be followed regardless of method of entry (PCMCIA card, CPDLC,
   AOC Datalink, manual entry).
      6.15.3.1. One pilot independently loads the FMS waypoints as depicted on the DD Form
      175, DD Form 1801, or as cleared by ATC.
      6.15.3.2. Other pilot independently verifies route (lat/longs and distances to the max
      extent possible) was entered correctly either through use of FLIP products or CFP.
      6.15.3.3. Both pilots should visually check that any RNAV departure, arrival, or
      approach is accurately depicted on a moving map.
6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1 & V2, this chapter, and
appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/VFR),
review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach
procedures, NOTAMS, GDSS Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts. All performance data
computations will be reviewed by both pilots. Ensure that the DAFIF image file on FMS
PCMCIA card is current for date(s) of flight.
   6.16.1. Departure planning priority is as follows:
      6.16.1.1. Ensure aircraft is capable of making published climb restrictions with all
      engines operating.
      6.16.1.2. Use of current SDP for planned departure runway.
      6.16.1.3. Subtract up to 48 ft/nm from the published climb gradient for OEI.
      6.16.1.4. Use of a VFR departure as described in this volume, AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN
      11-217V1 & AFMAN 11-217V2 Visual Flight Procedures.
   6.16.2. VFR Departures.      NOTE: VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle
   clearance planning.
      6.16.2.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
      method for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
      methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
      requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the mission is planned as a
      VFR flight for training. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and
      high terrain are avoided.
      6.16.2.2. IAW AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V2 crews are specifically authorized
      to depart VFR without meeting IFR departure procedure restrictions along the planned
      departure route with one engine inoperative while adhering to the following:
          6.16.2.2.1. Utilize radar advisory, monitoring, or control services when practical, and
          ensure flight following by any available means (i.e. FSS or C2).
          6.16.2.2.2. Crews must be knowledgeable of and comply with guidance contained in
          AFMAN 11-217V2.
          6.16.2.2.3. Crews are responsible for terrain and obstacle planning/avoidance and
          must climb to the Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) as soon as practical.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                               97


         6.16.2.2.4. Crews will use all available resources to mitigate risk. This includes (but
         not limited to) supervisors, ORM, aircraft flight manuals, and aircraft commander
         discretion.
         6.16.2.2.5. Operations IAW this authorization are to be used as the last resort when
         the mission justifies the increased risk.
         6.16.2.2.6. Consider reducing aircraft gross weight and/or delaying the mission until
         environmental conditions improve.
     6.16.2.3. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
     ensuring all the following conditions are met:
         6.16.2.3.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
         departure route.
         6.16.2.3.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
         emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance. NOTE: If unable to comply
         with any of the above conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until conditions that
         are more favorable exist.
     6.16.2.4. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of
     CONUS.
     6.16.2.5. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
     clearance and reaching the IFR MEA.
  6.16.3. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined in
  AFI 11-202V3, and AFMAN 11-217V1.
     6.16.3.1. An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an instrument approach.
     6.16.3.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
     are avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for
     IFR departure planning (AFMAN 11-217V1). NOTE: Screen height requirements for
     departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or the airfield where the
     departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews to determine screen
     height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those listed below, or
     when any doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at 35 feet
     (minimum) unless you can ascertain a different screen height requirement from an
     appropriate authority.
         6.16.3.2.1. Special Departure Procedure: Published on SDP.
         6.16.3.2.2. USAF/USN produced SID or USAF/USN/USMC airfield: Zero feet.
         6.16.3.2.3. US Army, FAA SID, and Joint Use Airfield within the US: 35 feet unless
         published.
         6.16.3.2.4. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Military Airports: 35 feet.
         6.16.3.2.5. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Civil Airports: 16 feet or as
         published.
         6.16.3.2.6. Other ICAO nations: 16 feet or as published.
98                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


        6.16.3.2.7. All others: 35 feet unless published.
     6.16.3.3. Aircraft must be able to meet the published climb gradient for the departure
     runway with all engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm
     will be used. NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL
     ENGINE climb gradient, download cargo/fuel or delay until conditions that are more
     favorable exist.
     6.16.3.4. The following methods are provided to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear
     all obstacles along the planned departure route with One-Engine Inoperative (OEI):
        6.16.3.4.1. Special Departure Procedures (SDP).        SDPs are MDS-specific OEI
        escape procedures. They are applicable after the loss of an engine and, where
        available, should be used for engine-out departure planning. Retrieve current SDPs
        from the Dynamic Runway Analysis (DRA) tab at https://www.milplanner.com
        (contact OGV for current username & password). SDP charts available at the
        Jeppesen/AF Ops Data Portal website are not intended as the primary source. ‘Ad
        hoc’ requests for fields not currently listed may be requested through OGV NLT 48
        hrs prior to scheduled departure. HQ AMC/A3V authorizes the use of Ad Hoc SDPs
        for a maximum of 7 days after the analysis date.
            6.16.3.4.1.1. SDPs will be used for missions deemed ‘operationally necessary’ by
            the appropriate mission execution authority.
                6.16.3.4.1.1.1. All 618 AOC (TACC) and CVAM tasked missions are
                deemed operationally necessary by AMC /A3 and 18 AF/CC. SDPs are
                authorized.
                6.16.3.4.1.1.2. Training missions with external users (e.g. tanker/receiver
                AAR training, cargo load training, JA/ATT, etc.) are deemed operationally
                necessary. SDPs are authorized.
                 6.16.3.4.1.1.2.1. All other training missions may be deemed operationally
                 necessary by the OG/CC or equivalent (delegated no lower than SQ/DO), to
                 meet mission and/or aircraft performance requirements.
                6.16.3.4.1.1.3. SDP routing that departs from the standard departure routing is
                not Air Traffic Control (ATC)-approved and will not be filed. It will be
                briefed and available for reference prior to and during departure. The PF
                should brief the crew on possible scenarios that would necessitate use of this
                SDP routing.
                6.16.3.4.1.1.4. In the rare case where an SDP maximum takeoff gross weight
                (MTOW) exceeds the Fuel Management Advisory Computer (FMAC)
                minimum climb capability (producing a “no go” message), the crew will
                adhere to limits set by the FMAC.
        6.16.3.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
        is 200’/NM, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of
        152’/NM plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48’/NM. If an SDP is not
        available, the crew must ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb
        gradients for the selected departure, with one-engine inoperative. Minimum climb
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 99


             gradients may be published as a ‘Trouble T’ restriction in the IFR Take-off
             Minimums section of FLIP or on a SID. When required for mission accomplishment,
             crews may subtract 48’/NM from published climb gradients before computing
             engine-out takeoff data. Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low, close
             in obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200’ AGL and below) which should normally be
             published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T). Crews
             must also ensure the aircraft can clear these obstacles by computing the MTOGW for
             the obstacles and comparing it to that calculated for the climb restriction.
                6.16.3.4.2.1. If operational requirements dictate, the mission execution authority
                may authorize the PIC to subtract up to 48’/NM from the published (or standard)
                climb gradient for OEI departure planning.
                    6.16.3.4.2.1.1. For all 618 AOC (TACC) and CVAM tasked missions, and for
                    training missions with external users, the PIC is authorized to subtract up to
                    48’/NM.
                    6.16.3.4.2.1.2. For all other missions, the OG/CC or equivalent (delegated no
                    lower than SQ/DO) may authorize the PIC to subtract up to 48’/NM. NOTE:
                    If the requirements of paragraph 6.16.3.4.1 or 6.16.3.4.2 cannot be met,
                    download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.

MISSION                   VISIBILTY REMARKS

Operational               1000’ RVR    When less than RVR 1600, but equal to or greater than
                          (300 meters) RVR 1000, the crew may take off if mission priority
                                       dictates, provided the runway has dual RVR readouts and
                                       displays (minimum RVR 1000 on both) and runway
                                       centerline lighting is operational. For any takeoff below
                                       1600 RVR, the crew must be fully qualified.

All others                1600’ RVR     For runways with more than one operating RVR
                          (500          readout, RVR must read 1600 minimum on all.
                          meters)

NOTES:
If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported to be
1/2 mile (800 meters).
When weather is below approach and landing minimums (ceiling or visibility) a takeoff alternate
is required (See paragraph 6.19.)

6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be
within the same terminal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not
 100                                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


restricted by FLIP, FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and
performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of
alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally should be used if they meet the
above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced. See Chapter 14 for specific fuel
planning requirements. NOTE: For those missions flight managed by the 618 AOC (TACC),
Flight Managers will provide a route of flight to the primary alternate if greater than 75 miles
from the destination. This route of flight is only for providing an accurate fuel plan and is not
part of the route of flight filed with ATC.
6.19. Departure Alternates.
   6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if weather is below landing minimums for the
   lowest suitable approach (at departure aerodrome). If planning an ILS approach, CAT 1
   minimums will be used.
   6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
   (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as
   a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
       6.19.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be
       equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1
       hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400’/750m),
       or;
       6.19.2.2. For an alternate within two hours flying time, the existing weather must be at
       least 500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than
       600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to
       remain so for 1 hour after ETA at the alternate.
6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will be
according to AFI 11-202V3, and the following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
       6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the
       available DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach; or
       6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
       published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement
       (for example Jeppesen® approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed
       by taking the published HAA, HATh, or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one
       hundred feet (or as determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen®
       VOR approach with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of
       700 feet; or
   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the departure or destination
   aerodrome is outside the CONUS. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights less than 3-
   hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.
   6.20.3. When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews may use 2+00 holding fuel (in
   lieu of an alternate). A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due
   to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 101


   flying time. The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following
   criteria:
        6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds must be within limits at ETA and forecast to
        remain so for 2 hours thereafter. Aircrew will account for planned RCR when calculating
        wind limits.
        6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
        minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
        precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
        precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach
        minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours). NOTE: See Chapter 14 for fuel planning
        considerations to a remote or island destination.
   6.20.4. Weather minimums for an airfield with two or more suitable independent precision
   approaches available and operating at the same time is 1000 ft and visibility of 2 statute
   miles. This weather minimum includes TEMPO and prevailing conditions for intended
   landing destination +/- one hour of arrival.
        6.20.4.1. Qualifying airports must have two or more separate runways, each with
        precision approaches operating at the same time. Multiple precision approaches to only
        one end of the runway do not count. Two ILSs that use the same frequency/antennas do
        not qualify as two independent approaches.
6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
        6.21.1.1. The KC-135 is a category II aircraft for turbulence. Since standard Air Force-
        produced turbulence products are based upon Category II aircraft, no interpretation is
        required. However, if referencing other products or pilot reports, crew members should
        use Table 6.4 and Table 6.5 to convert turbulence forecasts or reports between aircraft
        types that are from different turbulence categories.

( ) = Occational (less than 1/3 of the time)

NOTE: Use caution when converting extreme turbulence reports between various aircraft types.
Extreme turbulence causes a range of effects from a minimum threshold (rapid airspeed
fluctuations greater than 25 knots) to a maximum threshold (structural damage). Even though
the table considers this, the design is more for the sake of “completeness” rather than
observational or scientific evidence.

          6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
          fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                               103


     WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
     and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
  6.21.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
  operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
  NOTE: Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological
  Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is
  equivalent to severe icing. When freezing fog is forecast or reported, aircrews will confirm
  with weather agencies what type (if any) icing is associated with the freezing fog.
     6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under
     conditions of freezing drizzle except when aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced
     IAW flight manual procedures.
     6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause
     ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-
     icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
         6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective
         flight manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in their
         associated flight manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover
         times.
         6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids provide little anti-icing
         benefit, and therefore have limited holdover times. As a guide, for approved fluids,
         crews may use published holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-2, Aircraft Anti-icing
         Procedures, and AFFSA holdover tables located at the HQ AFFSA website. The
         holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and the PIC shall use time,
         temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine when times are exceeded and re-
         apply fluid if required.
         6.21.2.2.3. Ice Pellets. Tests show that ice pellets generally remain the frozen state
         imbedded in Type IV anti-icing fluid, and are not absorbed by the fluid in the same
         manner as other forms of freezing/frozen precipitation. These embedded ice pellets
         are generally not readily detectable by the human eye during pre-takeoff
         contamination check procedures. Using current guidelines for determining anti-icing
         fluid failure, the presence of a contaminant not absorbed by the fluid (remaining
         embedded) would be an indication that the fluid has failed. Therefore, for ice pellets,
         allowance times are used rather than holdover times. Approved ice pellet allowance
         times      are    available     at   the     HQ       AFFSA/A3OF        website      at
         https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/a3of.
         6.21.2.2.4. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
         completed within 5 minutes of departure.
  6.21.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
  If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet,
  avoid them by at least:
     6.21.3.1. 20 NMs at or above FL230.
104                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


      6.21.3.2. 10 NMs below FL230. CAUTION: Developing thunderstorms/cumulonimbus
      clouds can grow/build vertically at a rate in excess of 3,000 feet per minute. Aircraft
      damage may occur 20NMs or more from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must familiarize
      themselves with information on thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to AFH
      11-203, Weather for Aircrews.
  6.21.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be
  used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should
  never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-
  based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance
  instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
      6.21.4.1. Changing routing.
      6.21.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
      6.21.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
  6.21.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
  advective clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
  thunderstorms.
  6.21.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
  departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
      6.21.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
      6.21.6.2. Maintain at least 5NMs separation from heavy rain showers.
      6.21.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within plus or minus 5,000
                                                                             NOTE: Approaches
      or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs providing
      they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds,
      gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and are not forecast or
      observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned
      missed approach corridor, if applicable).
  6.21.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
  or below, refer to 11-202V3 Chapter 8 and the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) Section
  D, Temperature Correction Chart, to correct MDA, DA, and other barometric altitudes inside
  the FAF.
  6.21.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
  turbulence. Refer to AFH 11-203, Weather for Aircrews, for additional information on
  mountain wave turbulence.
  6.21.9. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-
  flight weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft; contact nearest military
  weather facility or flight service station for details, if applicable.
  6.21.10. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
  volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. In the absence of MAJCOM guidance, pilots shall not
  plan to operate within 5 NM of any hazardous volcanic ash, without MAJCOM/A3 approval.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                105


   6.21.11. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning
   strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
       6.21.11.1.
       6.21.11.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
       thunderstorm activity.
6.22. Operational Risk Management (ORM) ORM is a logic based, common sense
approach to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors
before, during, and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in Air Force
Policy Directive 90-9, Operational Risk Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets
IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as part of preflight activities.
   6.22.1. Flying units will develop a local ORM program to include personal ORM assessment
   for all missions and accomplished by all crewmembers prior to each flight.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.23. Hazard Identification and Mitigation. After the entire crew is assembled at the aircraft,
the PIC will brief primary mission hazards facing the crew during takeoff and climb-out.
6.24. AFTO Form 781 Series.
   6.24.1. Review AFTO Form 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating
   aircraft systems. An exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance officer,
   maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional release. If
   one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release. Ensure
   that the DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate, and AIR card are aboard the aircraft.
   6.24.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. AFRC
   crews also see AFI 11-202V3/AFRCSUP1. After the maintenance release is obtained,
   coordinate mission requirements with the controlling agency. The PIC’s concurrence is
   required before the aircraft can be flown.
   6.24.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to
   paragraph 12.3
6.25. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. Reference paragraph 12.4
   6.25.1. APU Usage. For fuel conservation, minimize use of APU. Aircrews will use
   Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) to the maximum extent possible consistent with T.O.
   guidance and mission requirements. AGE will include electrical power and heating/cooling
   units as applicable. Normal APU procedures apply for engine start/shutdown operations and
   when specifically required to accomplish pre-/post-flight checklist items.
6.26. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). Refer to Chapter 12 for

6.27. Aircrew Flight Equipment and Oxygen System Requirements.
106                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


  6.27.1. Oxygen. For flights where the total number of individuals on board the aircraft does
  not exceed the total number of operational flight crew oxygen system stations, the minimum
  quantity of oxygen aboard an aircraft before takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the
  planned flight from the equal time point (ETP) to recovery should oxygen be required.
  Calculate using the 100 percent oxygen chart in the flight manual.
      6.27.1.1. Crewmembers occupying or transiting the cargo compartment will have a
      portable oxygen walk-around bottle with quick-don mask/helmet, or Emergency
      Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS) available for use in the event of an emergency.
      6.27.1.2. Crewmembers performing passenger monitoring duty will use a portable
      oxygen bottle with helmet or quick don attached.
      6.27.1.3. On missions carrying passengers, if EPOS is not prepositioned throughout the
      cargo compartment, distribute EPOS to each passenger regardless of planned flight
      altitude.
  6.27.2. Rafts. On overwater flights do not carry more passengers and crewmembers than life
  rafts will accommodate.
  6.27.3. Life preserver units (LPUs) or Personal Floatation Device. The passenger monitor
  will place an LPU within easy reach of each passenger and aircrew member before takeoff on
  overwater flights (outside gliding distance to land). Crewmembers will fit and adjust LPUs
  for overwater flights. Ensure the appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard
  for overwater missions carrying children and infants.
      6.27.3.1. Over-water is defined as any flight exceeding 50 NM from the nearest shoreline
      or a power-off glide distance (15:1), whichever is less.
  6.27.4. Restraining Harness. Personnel performing duties near an open (or suspected open)
  door or hatch in-flight will be restrained by a PCU-17/P restraint harness and one HBU-6/P
  safety strap.
  6.27.5. Anti-Exposure Suits. Any unit scheduled to conduct operations above 78 degrees
  North or below 60 degrees South will configure the aircraft with the appropriate quantity of
  anti- exposure suits prior to mission execution.
  6.27.6. MA-1 Portable Oxygen Bottles.
      6.27.6.1. There are three types of A-21 regulators on MA-1 portable oxygen bottles,
      unmodified, modified and modified2. Except for fill times, operation of the bottles are
      identical. Refill valve type is determined by viewing the inside of the fill nozzle and/or
      identaplate as specified below:
         6.27.6.1.1. Unmodified: Refill valves have a push valve inside the nozzle resembling
         a standard tire valve stem.
         6.27.6.1.2. Modified: Refill valves have a brass plate/filter covering inside of the
         nozzle and no valve stem is visible.
         6.27.6.1.3. Modified2 (Fast Fill): Refill valves have a brass plate/filter covering
         inside of the nozzle and no valve stem is visible. Part number on the identaplate is
         one of the following: 9010A4, 9010A5, 3260007-0201, 3260007-0103.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                107


       6.27.6.2. Ensure a minimum of two unmodified/modified2 bottles are installed on the
       aircraft, one at the aft emergency station and the other at the Boom Operator’s forward
       station. Additional unmodified/modified2 bottles should be installed in the cargo
       compartment first.
           6.27.6.2.1. Home Station Departures. A waiver to the minimum number of required
           unmodified/modified2 bottles may be granted on a case-by-case basis. (see
           paragraph 4.3)
           6.27.6.2.2. Enroute    Departures.      Maintain       minimum        number      of
           unmodified/modified2. If unable, continue until reaching a location with replacement
           bottle(s).
6.28. Fleet Service. Ensure the required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough
to permit inventory prior to engine start.
6.29. Cargo Documentation. Proper cargo or mail documentation will accompany each load.
   6.29.1. Load Data Information (Applicable to AFRC/ANG completing 618 AOC (TACC)-
   directed mission). At stations where there is no mobility air transportation function, the
   aircrew will collect the required load information on each leg, and submit it to the first
   station, which has such a function. The report will be submitted on AF Form 4075, Aircraft
   Load Data Worksheet.
6.30. Not Used.
6.31. Static Cling Sun Visors. Do not use sun visors with window heat on high. Sun visors will
be removed prior to installing thermal curtains.
   6.31.1. Sun visors will not be used on the Pilot #1 or Copilot #1 window during
   takeoffs/landings and receiver air refueling.
   6.31.2. Sun visors will not be used on the boom operator sighting window during air
   refueling operations.
   6.31.3. Sun visors are approved for daylight use only and shall be removed after every flight.

Section 6D—Departure

6.32. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are on time if the aircraft is airborne within
-20/+14 minutes of scheduled takeoff time or as specified in MAJCOM supplement.
   6.32.1. AAR Missions. Scheduled takeoff time may be adjusted to meet ARCT. PICs shall
   notify C2 agency before takeoff to adjust the scheduled takeoff time.
   6.32.2. Early Departures. Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to weather,
   ATC restrictions, airfield or aircraft operational limitations, to adjust mission flow during a
   large-scale operation, or if approved through C2 channels provided the impact on local and
   downrange facilities and crew duty is evaluated.
6.33. Not Used.

6.34. Flight Progress. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor INU/FMS
performance and flight progress. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation
capability that degrades centerline accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control center
(ARTCC). See Chapter 11 for detailed navigation procedures.
   6.34.1. Oceanic procedures. Crews will use only the MNPS Oceanic Checklist and the
   Oceanic Expanded Checklist for oceanic crossings. Locally generated oceanic checklists are
   prohibited. Where appropriate, units may augment the MNPS checklist with local
   supplements such as ALTRV, formation, and other unique mission requirements but in no
   case will they substitute for the MNPS checklist.
       6.34.1.1. For North Atlantic Oceanic airspace, pilots will follow the procedures written
       in the latest version of the MNPS manual. The MNPS manual is produced by the North
       Atlantic Systems Planning Group (NAT SPG) which does not have the authority to direct
       crew actions, hence the use of the word “should” throughout the document. However,
       where the MNPS manual uses “should”, crews will interpret this as “shall.” DoD Area
       Planning procedures will be followed only if they do not conflict with the MNPSA
       manual.
       6.34.1.2. For Northern Pacific Oceanic airspace, pilots will follow the procedures written
       in the FAA Alaska or Pacific Supplement. DoD Area Planning procedures will be
       followed only if they do not conflict with these Supplements.
       6.34.1.3. Pilots will use the following procedure prior to entering oceanic airspace to
       comply with coast out/in (gross nav) navigation accuracy checks.
           6.34.1.3.1. Select a NAVAID that provides a DME signal (within its standard service
           volume range) as close to the beam position from the aircraft as possible. DME
           distance should be no closer than the first two digits of the flight level value (e.g.
           FL310 equals a minimum distance of 31 miles).
           6.34.1.3.2. Display progress page 1on an MCD and enter the NAVAID identifier at
           BRG DST TO LSK 5R.
           6.34.1.3.3. Change one MFD to the ND Compass display and associated MFC HDG
           REF SEL switch to TRUE.
           6.34.1.3.4. Change the NAVAID CDI course selector so as to center the CDI for a
           course TO the NAVAID, note the DME distance then immediately record the
           progress page course and distance information displayed onto the Master Document.
           6.34.1.3.5. Record the following navigation accuracy check information on the
           master document: NAVAID identifier, time (UTC), MC ANP or FOM value, and
           courses and distances from progress page display and ND Compass display.
           6.34.1.3.6. If the noted DME distance and course in the CNC window are not within
           4 miles and 4 degrees attempt another navigation accuracy check with another
           NAVAID, check MC position during over flight of a VOR /NDB, or use ATC radar
           position information referencing a NAVAID or airfield compared with the progress
           page 1 BRG DST TO LSK 5R.
       6.34.1.4. Ten minute plotting information will include the following:
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 109


         6.34.1.4.1. Full Lat/Long position
         6.34.1.4.2. UTC time at that position
         6.34.1.4.3. Flight level/Altitude
         6.34.1.4.4. MC position update source with MC ANP/FOM
         6.34.1.4.5. Pilot ID switch position
     6.34.1.5. Hourly altimeter checks (if required) will be annotated on the master document.
  6.34.2. Another pilot will verify waypoint data inserted into the Mission Computer. Check
  both the coordinate information and the distances between waypoints against the flight plan.
     6.34.2.1. Once the oceanic clearance is received and any time the oceanic clearance is
     changed, both pilots will re-verify waypoint data inserted into the Mission Computer.
  6.34.3. Obtain a coast out fix prior to, or immediately on entering the Category I Route or
  over- water segment. Perform a gross navigational error check using available NAVAIDS
  and annotate the position and time on the chart.
  6.34.4. When approaching each waypoint on a Category I Route, recheck coordinates for the
  next waypoint.
  6.34.5. Approximately 10 minutes after passing each oceanic waypoint, record and plot the
  aircraft position and time on the chart, and ensure compliance with courses and ETA
  tolerances.
  6.34.6. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the chart.
  6.34.7. Upon return to home station, turn in the charts (copies if reused) and applicable
  computer flight plans to the squadron. Squadrons will retain the charts, computer flight
  plans, and associated materials for a minimum of 3 months.
  6.34.8. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace into
  territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not amend
  entry point(s).
     6.34.8.1. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
     departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a
     clearance has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
     6.34.8.2. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
     penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
     country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
     6.34.8.3. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts
     to negate existing clearances, ACs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response
     will be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to planned
     destination, as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in international
     airspace." Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission continuation. Under no
     circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance, which routes their mission over
     sovereign airspace, which was not approved through diplomatic channels before mission
     departure, as being valid authorization.
 110                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


       6.34.8.4. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing
       will normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility
       transited before performing the critical portion of the mission.
6.35. In-Flight Meals. Pilots should not eat meals at the same time, and their meals should
consist of different menu items.
6.36. Communications Instructions Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings (CIRVIS) and
Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in FLIP
planning or FLIP En route Supplement.
   6.36.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
   air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
   and the type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency. Also,
   attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF or VHF range.
   6.36.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in JCS Pub 6V5 and AFMAN10-206,
   Operational Reporting.
6.37. Communications.
   6.37.1. Crews will conduct an HF radio ground check before takeoff if use of the HF radio
   will be required for ATC or C2 communications. If unable to verify that HF is operational on
   the ground, attempt to establish HF contact before going out of UHF/VHF range. If unable to
   establish HF contact with the controlling HF station, and an alternate means of relay of ATC
   information is not available, the aircraft should return to the nearest suitable support base. In
   the case of airborne HF failure, crews are authorized to continue under the following
   conditions:
       6.37.1.1. Use SATCOM to contact responsible station via special telephone
       numbers/short codes published in State AIPs (Aeronautical Information Publication).
       6.37.1.2. Attempt to contact ATC facility on VHF frequency.
       6.37.1.3. Attempt VHF relay via another aircraft on 123.45 MHz.
   6.37.2. Pilots shall provide ARTCC position and weather observations when required. If
   unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt to relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.
   6.37.3. C2 personnel have GDSS permissions to uplink/send free text ACARS messages. C2
   personnel within unit command posts should only uplink/send ACARS messages to aircraft
   tails/aircrews under their OPCON. C2 personnel should consider the aircraft phase of flight
   before uplinking/sending ACARS messages. C2 personnel will end each Free Text message
   with their C2 agency and Initials. Example: “…KSKA CP MGH…”. C2 personnel will not
   send ACARS messages to Flight Managed sorties unless coordination has been accomplished
   with the responsible Flight Manager. Messaging procedures between aircrews and Flight
   Managers will not change.
       6.37.3.1. Aircrews should begin each free text message sent to a unit command post with
       the ICAO identifier followed by ‘CP’. (Ex. KSKA CP). This format ensures the correct
       C2 agency responds to the message. On Flight Managed sorties, the FM flight following
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 111


       the sortie functions as the primary ACARS C2 link. Aircrews must consider
       OPSEC/COMSEC when sending AOC messages.
   6.37.4. SATCOM aircraft to aircraft communications. In order to call from aircraft to
   aircraft, comply with the following format:
AA87B5CCCCCCC
AA: Local international code (i.e. 01 for the U.S.)
87: INMARSAT call identifier
B: Oceanic Region
1: Atlantic Ocean Region (East) – Europe
2: Pacific Ocean Region
3: Indian Ocean Region
4: Atlantic Ocean Region (West) - CONUS
5: Terminal type (aircraft) CCCCCCC: Mode S code
For example, to call a KC-135 in the Pacific Region, dial 018745+CCCCCCC.
   6.37.5. SATCOM aircraft to ground communication. To call a ground station with the
   SATCOM, use the following format:
00 + Country Code + Area Code + Number
6.38. In-flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC will report deviations from directives that
may occur as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions
permitting, inform passengers of the situation and intentions.
   6.38.1. Notification of C2 Agencies. When practical after completing the aircraft emergency
   action checklists and associated actions, the PIC will furnish ATC and appropriate C2
   agencies with a description of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any other
   pertinent information.
   6.38.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL/SKYHOOK when additional
   expertise is necessary. Communications procedures are as follows:
       6.38.2.1. Local Area. Use appropriate UHF or VHF frequencies.
       6.38.2.2. En route. Attempt to establish a phone patch with the nearest or controlling C2
       Center using global HF network, UHF/VHF stations, SATCOM, etc. If unable, aircrews
       are permitted to use ARINC radio service as an additional avenue for phone patch
       connectivity.
       6.38.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits:
           6.38.2.3.1. Description of the situation to include actions taken and intentions.
           6.38.2.3.2. What assistance is being requested.
           6.38.2.3.3. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.
           6.38.2.3.4. Position.
 112                                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


           6.38.2.3.5. Altitude and flight conditions.
           6.38.2.3.6. Number of personnel and DVs on board.
           6.38.2.3.7. Qualification of PIC.
           6.38.2.3.8. Planned landing destination and ETA.
   6.38.3. BOEING C/KC-135 In-flight Emergency Support. Boeing provides 24-hour support
   for C/KC-135 in-flight emergencies. To use this service: obtain a phone patch to one of the
   numbers listed below, tell the operator you have an “INFLIGHT EMERGENCY” and
   identify the base or location in which the phone patching is established. These numbers are
   only to be used for in- flight emergency support: DSN 743-5687, Commercial: 800-721-
   0422 or 206-655-9200.
6.39. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. Notification will include the patient’s sex, approximate age, and major
complaint.
6.40. Weather Forecasts. It is the pilot’s and flight manager’s responsibility to obtain
destination weather prior to descent. The primary sources are 618 AOC (TACC) weather
operations, OWSs, and USAF weather flights via pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV) or
through a USAF aeronautical station. For aircraft flying in EUCOM AOR (ENAME operations)
contact USAFE/OWS at Sembach AB, GE. SOUTHCOM AOR contact 612 Support Squadron
Weather Flight (SPTS/WX) at Davis-Montham AFB, AZ. The ATC system can provide weather
information to en route aircraft.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Prior to the top of descent (TOD), the PIC will identify and discuss mitigation of
associated hazards to the penetration, approach, landing, and airfield. Before descent into
unfamiliar areas, pilots and navigators will review appropriate terrain charts to increase aircrew
situational awareness of obstructions. Every effort will be made to accomplish briefings and
appropriate checklists prior to TOD. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other
than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the
initial descent point to landing.
   6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR conditions
   if an approved instrument approach is not available or operational missions require a tactical
   approach. NOTE: For VFR or visual approaches at locations other than home station, an ILS
   glide slope indicator or a visual glide slope indicator (e.g. VASI, PAPI, etc.) is required.
       6.41.1.1. On training/evaluation flights at familiar fields or recovery at home station,
       pilots may fly non-precision approaches or VFR traffic patterns to accomplish required
       training and evaluations. The pilot not flying will monitor a precision approach or visual
       glide slope indicator when practical to enhance safety.
       6.41.1.2. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision
       approach, if weather minimums permit.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                113


6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.42.1. Aircraft category. The KC-135 is a category "D" aircraft. If approach speeds exceed
   66 knots, the minimums for category "E" will be used.
   6.42.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
   with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3.
   6.42.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an en
   route descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
      6.42.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or side step approaches.
          6.42.3.1.1. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400’ (750
          meters) or ½ SM (800 meters) if no RVR readout is available.
      6.42.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
          6.42.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the
          required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet
          rounded up to the next one hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 feet,
          add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then round up to the next one hundred foot value
          which would be 900 feet. Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900 feet.)
          When circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach
          minimums will be as published, but in no case lower than 600 feet and 2 miles
          visibility.
      6.42.3.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by 1/2
      SM or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway
      approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. (This applies only to the ALS itself, not to
      VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the ALS.)
      6.42.3.4. If the ceiling is below the value depicted for published DoD or NACO
      precision approach, but visibility is at or above authorized minimums, comply with fuel
      requirements before initiating en route descent, penetration, or approach.
      6.42.3.5. Variable visibility/ceiling reports. Pilots will use the static RVR when available
      (regardless of reported variability). If only a variable report is received and a static RVR
      cannot be determined, pilots will apply the lowest reported RVR value. If it is
      subsequently determined that weather is actually below minimums for the approach,
      comply with 6.42.7 Do not attempt further approaches until the lowest visibility/ceiling
      reported is at/above approach minimums.
   6.42.4. Flight Instrumentation Requirements.
      6.42.4.1. PAR and Category I ILS. Full flight instrumentation consists of: dual flight
      displays are required (one flight director plus ADI repeat), complete differential pressure
      instruments, heading/compass systems, and attitude indicators in the pilot and copilot
      positions.
      6.42.4.2. Full flight instrumentation for a precision approach radar (PAR) consists of:
      complete differential pressure instruments, heading/compass systems, and attitude
      indicators in the pilot and copilot positions.
114                                                  AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


  6.42.5. Category I ILS Procedures. Decision height for precision approaches will be as
  published, but no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown (HAT). Crews are permitted
  to execute with less than 2400 RVR (1800 RVR or greater) at locations without touchdown
  zone and centerline lighting (or when such systems are inoperative) provided the approach
  plate contains the authorization note and the approach is flown using flight director or
  coupled autopilot to the decision altitude.
      6.42.5.1. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be
      certified to conduct an ILS PRM approach. Refer to AFI 11-2KC135V1 for certification
      procedures. Comply with the following operational procedures:
         6.42.5.1.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
         6.42.5.1.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
         6.42.5.1.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA
         ATCSCC at 1-800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated
         arrival time. Pilots who arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach
         clearance, who did not contact ATC prior to departure, should expect an ATC
         directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
         6.42.5.1.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be
         disengaged when a breakout is directed.
         6.42.5.1.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall
         immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC
         clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA,
         comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot
         determines safety to be a factor.
  6.42.6. RNAV SID/STAR and Approach Procedures. Properly trained KC-135 aircrews are
  permitted to fly RNAV and RNAV (GPS) approaches. RNAV and RNAV (GPS) approaches
  will be flown only to LNAV minima. KC-135 aircraft are not authorized to fly “overlay GPS
  approaches,” due to concerns about the ability to accurately code the missed approach
  portion of these procedures. “Overlay GPS approaches” are characterized by “Or GPS” in the
  title (i.e. VOR or GPS RWY 35). These approaches are designed differently from RNAV,
  RNAV (GPS), and GPS approaches because overlays are designed around ground based
  NAVAIDS and interpreted for spaced based navigation. This does not preclude the use of
  “GPS in lieu of” to define individual points on a conventional approach, such as a final
  approach fix defined by an NDB for an aircraft that is not equipped with an NDB; crews can
  still use GPS to define these individual points in accordance with AFMAN 11-217V1.
      6.42.6.1. GPS overlays of conventional SIDS and STARS found in DAFIF are only
      authorized for situational awareness and require the pilots to use the ground based
      NAVAIDS as their primary navigational source, where RNAV SIDS and STARS do not
      require the use of ground based NAVAIDS.
         6.42.6.1.1. When flying RNAV SIDS, accomplish a GYRO takeoff and ensure pilot
         flying’s primary course as a minimum is set to FMS. The crew will ensure the flight
         directors are set to NAV/LOC to provide flight director guidance prior to reaching
         500’ AGL, IAW FAA Advisory Circular 90-100A.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                               115


       6.42.6.2. Crews are authorized to fly RNAV (GPS) approaches if the only difference
       between the charted instrument approach procedure (IAP) and the DAFIF database
       procedure is the name of the MAP. Aircrews must still confirm all other IAP
       components (e.g. waypoint type, course, distance, etc.) match the charted IAP.
          6.42.6.2.1. While flying RNAV instrument approach procedures, crews are required
          to evaluate distance-to-fly displayed as the FMS sequences to the next point against
          the chart value while flying the approach. If significant deviations from the expected
          values are witnessed, the pilot should consider aborting the approach.
       6.42.6.3. Flight director lateral guidance must be available anytime the KC-135 is
       operating in RNP0.3 airspace.
   6.42.7. Established on a Segment of the Approach. When under radar vectors to final
   approach, when cleared for the approach or when established on a segment of the approach
   and the weather is reported or observed to be below approach minimums, the AC has the
   option of continuing the approach to the missed approach point (MAP)/DH. If the approach
   is abandoned, level off (or descend if a lower altitude is required for the missed approach
   procedure). Comply with the last assigned clearance until a new or amended clearance is
   received.
       6.42.7.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway environment
       is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
       6.42.7.2. If the approach is continued, the PIC must have sufficient fuel available to
       complete the approach and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with
       normal fuel reserve.
       6.42.7.3. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below
       designated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request.
   6.42.8. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to or above minimums provided:
       6.42.8.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
       and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
       remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
       6.42.8.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel
       will be consumed.
6.43. Not Used.
6.44. Unscheduled Landings. When an unscheduled landing or crew rest occurs at a base
without a passenger facility, the PIC should immediately advise the appropriate C2 agency and
request assistance in arranging substitute airlift for passengers on board. The following
procedures apply when obtaining support for service members, in a group travel status, who are
transported on AMC organic aircraft flying a Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)
mission, which incur an unscheduled delay due to weather or maintenance problems, forcing the
members to be lodged at that location until the aircraft can continue its mission.
   6.44.1. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities and AMC TWCF funds are
   available, payment for lodging (contract or on-base) will be made by the local accounting
 116                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   liaison/OPLOC citing TWCF funds. The appropriate TWCF fund cite may be obtained from
   the local financial analysis and/or accounting liaison office. Normally, a BPA contract or AF
   Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, is already established at these locations to charge the
   routine lodging costs for transient or TDY individuals who are on TWCF funded travel
   orders.
   6.44.2. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities are available and AMC TWCF funds
   are not available, the AC will utilize AF Form 15, United States Air Force Invoice, to acquire
   the appropriate lodging accommodations. Upon return to home station, the AC will send the
   AF Form 15 to the local accounting liaison office. A copy of the service members' group
   travel orders, along with any other pertinent supporting data, must accompany the form (e.g.,
   lodging invoice and/or receipts). When the AF Form 15 has been validated, it will be
   forwarded on to the servicing OPLOC for payment, citing the funds of the unit whose aircraft
   was delayed.
   6.44.3. If the delay is at a location where both DoD facilities and TWCF funds are
   unavailable, the PIC will utilize AF Form15 authority to acquire the appropriate meals,
   quarters, and transportation to support the service members. Upon return to home station, the
   PIC will send the AF Form 15 to the local accounting liaison office. A copy of the service
   members' group travel orders, along with any other pertinent supporting data, must
   accompany the form (e.g., lodging invoice and/or receipts). When the AF Form15 has been
   validated, it will be forwarded on to the servicing OPLOC for payment, citing the funds of
   the unit whose aircraft was delayed. NOTE: This policy does not apply to those passengers
   on delayed TWCF organic aircraft who are in a per diem or space available status, except for
   those duty passengers on TWCF funded travel orders delayed at locations where TWCF
   funds are available.
6.45. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing,
crewmembers will debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines,
avionics equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. At stations without
maintenance support, when a maintenance requirement exists the PIC will ensure a thorough
debrief is provided to the C2 agency. On all AMC/ANG/AFRC missions, notify 618 AOC
(TACC) Logistics Control (618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL).
6.46. Border Clearance. The border clearance responsibility will be as designated by the base
or area command in accordance with AFI 24-401, AFI 24-402, AFI 24-403, Border Clearance,
Customs Program, and other United States Entry Requirements and Related Areas.
   6.46.1. Normal Operations.
       6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
       clearance of its aircraft.
       6.46.1.2. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.
       Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or the BO, but the PIC retains ultimate
       responsibility. When a KC-135 aircraft is on-loaded at a base without an air traffic
       function, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:
          6.46.1.2.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid
          visas, when required.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                             117


         6.46.1.2.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of
         immunization (shot record).
         6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
         6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border
         clearance can be obtained.
         6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
         baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
         area.
         6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and paragraph 6.47).
  6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry.
     6.46.2.1. En route, the BO will distribute personal customs declarations (when not
     accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers. The
     BO will also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and prepare and
     compile necessary border clearance forms for the PIC's signature.
     6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in
     ETA to ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
     6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft,
     which has landed in the United States for customs clearance, proceed to another base in
     the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
     cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate
     offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to proceed
     is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be completed
     or a new permit to proceed is issued by a customs official. Do not make intermediate
     stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of manifested
     cargo unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2 center.
     6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
     normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
     passengers, troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life
     and property (crew chief excepted). Do not unload until approved by customs and
     agriculture personnel or their designated representatives. This procedure applies to the
     initial landing in the US and all landings required when operating on a permit to proceed
     or until all crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials
     6.46.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG, General
     Information (Chapter 3). In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are
     immune from searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety
     inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, PICs must be aware of, and adhere to, any
     specific FCG provisions for individual countries.
     6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
     the following procedures.
118                                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters
         (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then
         notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and
         follow their instructions.
         6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
         notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
         indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
         time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
         so.
         6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action
         being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
         appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
         physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
         and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
         authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
      6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
      Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG supplements.
  6.46.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
      6.46.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or
      exit, require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
      immunization, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding,
      between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
      6.46.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic and
      border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each
      operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the US onload or offload
      base, or at the foreign onload or offload base.
      6.46.4.3. Customs Procedures.
         6.46.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of Customs Form 7507, General
         Declaration (Outward/Inward), is not required unless directed.
             6.46.4.3.2.1. Customs Form 7507 (Passenger list not required).
             6.46.4.3.2.2. Cargo manifest.
             6.46.4.3.2.3. For troops out of country less than 140 days:
                 6.46.4.3.2.3.1. Troop commander's certificate for examination of troop
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                             119


               baggage.
               6.46.4.3.2.3.2. One copy of the US Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
               each passenger not under command of the troop commander, to include
               observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
               6.46.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
               representative will meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander's
               certificate with respect to troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are
               not required. The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage.
               6.46.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs
               representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs
               officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
            6.46.4.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:
               6.46.4.3.2.4.1. One copy of the U.S. Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
               each passenger. This includes observers, support personnel, civilians, news
               media personnel, and crewmembers. Personnel may use DD Form 1854,
               Customs Accompanied Baggage, U.S., or Customs Form 6059B.
               6.46.4.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
               representative will meet the aircraft and collect all declarations. Troops will
               debark under the observation of the customs representative who may make
               discretionary examination of the baggage.
     6.46.4.4. Public Health Procedures.
        6.46.4.4.1. When operating from a base without a traffic officer, the AC will ensure
        all crewmembers and passengers are properly immunized.
        6.46.4.4.2. Spray the aircraft if required.
     6.46.4.5. Immigration Procedures.
        6.46.4.5.1. Outbound: No requirements.
        6.46.4.5.2. Inbound: Submit the following to the immigration inspector if carrying
        civilian passengers.
            6.46.4.5.2.1. One copy of Customs Form 7507.
            6.46.4.5.2.2. One copy of Immigration Form I-92, Aircraft/Vessel Report.
            6.46.4.5.2.3. One copy/set of Immigration Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record,
            for each foreign national.
     6.46.4.6. Agriculture Procedures:
        6.46.4.6.1. Outbound: No requirement.
        6.46.4.6.2. Inbound: Consult AMC Border Clearance Guide.
            6.46.4.6.2.1. The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit,
            milk, milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat,
            and animal products can be brought into the United States. All items of troop
 120                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


              personal gear are to be cleaned of mud before being brought aboard the aircraft.
              Personal gear and equipment must be examined for snails and other plant pests to
              prevent their accidental entry into the U.S.
              6.46.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted
              will clear vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
              6.46.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or
              higher headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes
              before landing.
              6.46.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after
              troops have disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight
              lunches for prompt removal by fleet service personnel.
              6.46.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as
              offloaded. Any items, vehicles, or cargo found to be contaminated will be held for
              such treatment as the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical
              cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.46.5. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program. All crewmembers will ensure
   compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.
       6.46.5.1. Pre-cleared containers (regardless of size) will not be sealed with bolt-type
       seals and offered for air shipment. Only easily-broken (without specialized tools) seals
       are authorized for use; these include ball-type, cable, or plastic seals. Additionally,
       containers will not be locked with key-type or combination padlocks unless the crew has
       access to the key(s)/combination. The Boom Operator is the final on-scene authority to
       determine whether a seal or lock will be removed to facilitate an inspection. Every effort
       should be made to maintain pre-clearance integrity. For information regarding A3
       exemptions to these requirements, see AMCI 24-101V11, Cargo and Mail Policy.
6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, Department of Defense FCG, or
   as directed by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or on forms
   provided by the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on
   board. The only exception is when mandated by the FCG.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.
       Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying.
          6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
          sprayed.
          6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
          loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
          wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
          6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
          aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 121


           ventilation openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after
           use, spray before boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10
           minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on
           board.
       6.47.1.2. Spray for 105 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
       transited (see FCG). NOTE: Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they
       may be disposed of safely.
   6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, base operations, or airport manager of the
   situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection
   is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.48. Dropped Objects. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
   6.48.1. Notify 618 AOC (TACC) or the controlling agency as soon as practical; include
   details of routing, altitude, weather, etc.
   6.48.2. Notify maintenance at the first military station transited.
6.49. Flight Data Recorder/Cockpit Voice Recorder (FDR/CVR). Pulling the FDR/CVR
Circuit Breaker disables three pieces of equipment: Cockpit Voice Recorder, Flight Data
Recorder, and TEMS Monitoring System. If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and
terminating the emergency, pull the FDR/CVR power circuit breaker. This procedure keeps the
CVR from recording over itself, but retains the FDR/TEMS Data. If AOR SPINS direct clearing
the CVR information, crews will utilize the “Erase” function during engine shutdown vice
pulling the circuit breaker.
6.50. Aircrew Flight Equipment and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The PIC or
designated representative will:
   6.50.1. Before departing home station or en route stations, ensure appropriate serviceable
   protective clothing, aircrew flight equipment, and dash 21 equipment for the entire or
   remainder of the mission are aboard the aircraft.
   6.50.2. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review AF
   Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required dash 21 equipment
   has been certified as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed by
   maintenance, and configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.50.3. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review, sign,
   and date the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Aircrew Flight Equipment, to ensure all required
   AFE has been certified/installed by AFE personnel and that configuration documents match
 122                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   mission requirements. Ensure appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for
   over-water missions carrying children and infants.
       6.50.3.1. Anti-Exposure Suits. Any mission conducting operations North of 78 degrees
       North and South of 60 degrees South is required to carry anti-exposure suits.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment. Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will
   accomplish the following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO Form 781 entry for equipment found missing. Additionally,
       ensure equipment removed from the aircraft at an en route station is documented in the
       AFTO Form 781A.
       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant column
       indicating the quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is
       entered above the check number of that column. Leave AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form
       46 on board the aircraft in the event of an en route crew change.
       6.50.4.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
       recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.5. When possible, advise HQ AMC/A3TL (or MAJCOM AFE office) and
       appropriate C2 agency (or airport management) before mission continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
   annotated on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next
   vacant column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
   number of that column.
   6.50.6. Fall Protection. Aircrew members are prohibited from climbing onto the upper
   fuselage or wing surfaces. Aircraft Commanders will ensure no other personnel (excluding
   qualified ops/maintenance personnel), have access to, or be allowed to, climb onto the
   fuselage or wings.
6.51. Not Used.
6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting unfamiliar airfields or airfields where
conditions may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
   slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
   contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, etc., and previously unknown obstacles,
   airfield markings, or other safety critical items to HQ AMC/A3AS.
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.
6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the
PIC should seek to impound the aircraft immediately after landing IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft
and Equipment Management and contact the controlling C2 agency for further instructions.
6.54. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  123


responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP General Planning (GP) for
more information concerning wake turbulence separation.
6.55. Overflying En route Stops. The C2 agency may approve a request to overfly a scheduled
en route stop (NGB/A3X for ANG-directed missions and AFRC command center for AFRC-
directed missions).
6.56. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.56.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 Center or airfield
   management operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to
   Chapter 7 of this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft
   and equipment are protected. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management,
   provides specific guidance concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment
   aboard aircraft. For classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, seal
   the aircraft. If available, use Flyaway Security Teams to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use
   guards employed by the host country for flight line/airport area control. Do not leave
   unguarded classified information stored in navigation or radio equipment.
   6.56.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will
   provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during en route,
   turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is not available, the aircraft gun storage
   box may be used for material classified up to and including SECRET. Place a seal on the gun
   box/locker and secure it with a GSA-approved lock. Encrypted COMSEC will only be
   transferred to authorized DoD personnel.
   6.56.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode 4 when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode 4 (ground
   test assets permitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or
   contingency/exercise tasking.
   6.56.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode 4 before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor cancel
   a mission for an inoperable Mode 4, except when the aircraft will transit an area where safe
   passage procedures are implemented.
   6.56.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the CONUS for
   overseas locations if a ground check was not accomplished. Aircrews can request the Mode 4
   interrogation check through NORAD on UHF frequency 364.2. See Table 6.6 for Sector
   Operations Centers (SOCCS) that conduct interrogation checks.

Table 6.6. Sector Operations Centers (SOCCS).

   6.56.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode 4 will continue to their intended destinations. Repairs
   will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and maintenance
   technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented, aircraft will follow
   procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable airspace control order or Air
   Tasking Order (ATO).
   6.56.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode 4, when conducted, are mandatory
   maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of
   the Mode 4 on all aircraft forms (AFTO Form 781A).
   6.56.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the
   Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any
   destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC
   managers for guidance.
6.57. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects.
   6.57.1. Store only the minimum amount of professional gear required to accomplish the
   mission on the flight deck. Additional items, to include personal pubs bags, will be secured in
   the cargo compartment.
6.58. Not Used.
6.59. Aircraft Systems Operation.
   6.59.1. MFD. PF must have the top MFD set with the full ADI for all takeoffs, final
   approaches and landings. Course guidance (other than stick map) appropriate for the current
   ATC clearance, will be displayed on a PF MFD. EXCEPTION: When malfunctions limit the
   pilot to a single operable MFD.
       6.59.1.1. Due to MFD anti-glare degradation and associated cost to repair MFDs.
       Crewmembers will not touch/clean MFD displays unless using approved AEROKLEEN
       MFD wet and dry packets by AERO-CHEM. Using any other chemicals to clean the
       MFDs will remove the anti-glare coating.
   6.59.2. Autopilot. To the maximum extent possible, the aircraft will be flown with the
   autopilot coupled to the FMS (except for takeoffs, air refuelings, uncoupled approaches, and
   landings).
   6.59.3. Weather and Terrain Monitoring. One pilot will display weather radar on their MFD.
   Do not configure the weather radar to simultaneously operate in an excessive number of
   modes since this will significantly degrade normal radar performance in each individual
   mode.
   6.59.4. GPS, mode 4, and secure voice/HAVE QUICK keys. Load as required.
6.60. Aircrew Complement. At a minimum, KC-135 aircraft will be operated using three-
person procedures (two pilots and one boom operator). Commanders may designate that a
mission use four-person procedures (minimum two pilots, one navigator and one boom operator)
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                               125


if navigator currency/training requires (N/A ANG). When a mission is scheduled as four-person,
a “Navigator suite or B-Kit” must be installed at the navigator station.
   6.60.1. OPLAN 8010 will be flown three-person.
   6.60.2. SOAR will be flown four-person.
   6.60.3. Basic Navigator. Navigator’s duties include, but are not limited to, assist in mission
   planning/study, operating equipment at duty station, and functioning as backup to the pilot
   team for navigation, rendezvous and communication duties. Pilots will retain full
   responsibility for all navigation and rendezvous duties.
   6.60.4. SOAR Navigator. Navigator’s duties (on both SOAR and Non-SOAR missions)
   include mission planning/study, operating equipment at duty station, and functioning as crew
   lead for navigation, rendezvous and communications duties as directed by appropriate flight
   manuals and mission directives. Pilots provide backup for all navigator duties.
6.61. Aircraft Equipment Codes For Flight Plan Filing.
   6.61.1. The equipment codes and comments in Table 6.7 will be filed on the DD Form 1801
   barring equipment failure or insufficient training to operate equipment. While some
   equipment codes are not specifically addressed, such as D for DME or U for UHF, they are
   understood by ATC. Equipment codes over 10 characters may be truncated by many systems
   which eliminates other more important characters.

                                            Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the C/KC-135 aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting
Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking), AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO), and specific MAJCOM
security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information
concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. The C/KC-135 is a “Protection Level 3” resource. Aircraft security at non-United
States military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency.
7.3. Integrated Defense. The following security procedures will implement AFI 31-101
requirements for C/KC-135 aircraft:
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection
   IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking space is available, establish
   a temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with restricted area
   signs. Portable security lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if sufficient
   permanent lighting is not available. Post security forces IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.3.5. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crewmembers. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxis.
7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. Ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secure to show
unauthorized entry. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency the aircraft is sealed and provide them a
means to access the aircraft in an emergency. Annotate the forms with the time the aircraft was
sealed. The C2 Senior Controller may grant access to a sealed aircraft, shall document time of
entry and ensure it remains launch capable. The PIC or designated representative must be present
if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure the aircraft is resealed. The aircrew pre-
preflight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew, sealed, and flown by another
aircrew. NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for documentation and management
IAW T.O. 00-20-1 and MAJCOM Supplement.
7.5. En route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. The PIC will receive a threat assessment and en
route security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station
departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required. If required, a Flyaway
Security Team will be assigned to the mission. Use Flyaway Security Teams to guard the
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                   127


aircraft; otherwise, use guards employed by the host country for flight line/airport security area
control.
   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of three US Air Force security force
   members, but may include more depending on security requirements. The team's travel status
   is determined by MAJCOM. The team travels in MEP status and is responsible to the PIC at
   all times. In turn, the PIC is responsible for the team’s welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.).
   Ensure security team members receive a mission briefing and aircraft egress/passenger
   briefing (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
       7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
       authorities request payment for this service, use AF Form 15, United States Air Force
       Invoice.
       7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crewmembers to
       remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
       the aircraft vicinity.
       7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate
       and the PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the
       FDP limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
       considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as
       practical. If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
       their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
       requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
       The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
       protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
       nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
       appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, Air
   Force Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
       7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
       duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
       7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC’s judgment, the aircraft needs to
   be sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
       7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
       7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
       inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
 128                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


       7.6.1.3. Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal).
       7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
       a forced entry.
       7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special
       Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft
       thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
       7.6.1.6. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews
       must always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security
       locations. In addition to normal preflight activities, aircrews must inspect areas of the
       aircraft not covered by normal preflight duties, to include: aircraft wheel wells, keel beam
       bays and lower nose compartment for unauthorized packages, personnel, or other
       unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items to host security forces. Aircrews will
       maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a C/KC-135 is operating
away from home station, the PIC will comply with this chapter and AFI 31-207, as
supplemented.
   7.7.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger service
   representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and baggage
   is accomplished.
       7.7.1.1. The Transportation Security Administration provides the latest guidance on
       passenger screening and carry-on allowances. The latest guidance can be downloaded
       from www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/index.shtm.
          7.7.1.1.1. Aircrew must ensure that thorough screenings are accomplished when
          processing passengers at locations without an AMC Passenger Terminal.
          7.7.1.1.2. Carry-on restrictions apply to all passengers required to process through
          the passenger terminal, or equivalent when at a non-AMC location. Carry-on
          restrictions do not apply to those not required to process through the passenger
          terminal, or equivalent when at a non-AMC locations. This includes:
              7.7.1.1.2.1. Aircrew members listed on the Flight Authorization for that mission.
              7.7.1.1.2.2. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) for that mission.
              7.7.1.1.2.3. OSA/VIPSAM passenger not required to process through the
              Passenger Terminal (primary DV, spouses/party, aides, and security details only).
              7.7.1.1.2.4. Duty passengers on ANG/AFRC mission numbers.
          7.7.1.1.3. Consider baggage contained in areas not readily accessible in flight as
          checked baggage, even if carried to the aircraft by the passengers. This includes, but
          is not limited to baggage restrained in the cargo compartment.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                    129


          7.7.1.1.4. Brief non-exempt passengers that baggage in these areas is not to be
          accessed in-flight. If any non-exempt passenger attempts to access checked baggage
          in-flight, land the aircraft at the nearest suitable airport (preferably a military facility)
          with appropriate law enforcement personnel. Request assistance in removing the
          passenger(s) and accompanying baggage from the aircraft. Comply with all law
          enforcement direction.
   7.7.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
   7.7.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.7.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXECPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
      7.7.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
      aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
      weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the tactical
      situation dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at the order
      of the troop commander or team leader.
          7.7.4.1.1. Normally, weapons will remain clear with magazines or clips removed
          until immediately prior to exiting the aircraft. However, when the tactical situation
          dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at the order of the
          troop commander or team leader.
              7.7.4.1.1.1. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine is installed in the
              weapon. This applies even if the magazine is empty.
      7.7.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order
      of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
      7.7.4.3. Flyaway Security Teams will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated
      missions identified on the mission “frag” as “Flyaway Security Team in-flight arming
      required”.
   7.7.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
      7.7.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
      personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
      7.7.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures. Ensure troop/PIC
      retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.7.4.1
7.8. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.8.1. The Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has exclusive
   responsibility to direct law enforcement activity related to actual or attempted aircraft piracy
   (hijacking) in the United States. See CJCSI 3610.01A, Aircraft Piracy(Hijacking) and
 130                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   Destruction of Derelict Airborne Objects, dated 20 Jun 06, and 49 USC 46501 and 49 USC
   44903(e).
   7.8.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.8.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.8.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.8.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.8.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.8.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.8.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.8.9. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
   7.8.10. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the
   anti- hijacking effort.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to direct
physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
       be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
           7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  131


           7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
           7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
           7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DoD 5210.41M, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, paragraph 9B(3), for
   additional guidance.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. If an in-the-clear
transmission is not possible, set transponder to 7500. If unable to set transponder, or if not under
radar control, transmit a radio message indicating transponder change to 7500. Notify ground
agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as
circumstances permit. Covert signals are no longer to be used per FAA guidance.
7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for
air intercept.
7.13. Arming of Crewmembers. When crews are directed to be armed by the mission
execution authority, the PIC will determine which crewmembers will be armed (two
crewmembers will be armed unless directed otherwise). All crewmembers should know who is
armed. The following procedures apply when arming is directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crewmembers will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must
   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF
   Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crewmembers. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and from
   the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities.
 132                                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


       7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
       identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
       checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew orders, their military
       identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, authorizing
       the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they will allow
       the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew will then
       proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their pockets. This
       will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
   7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight,
   onload or offload duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. When no passengers
   are aboard that require arming, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a
   satisfactory stowaway check. Crewmembers will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be
   unloaded before placing them in a gun box.
   7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
       7.13.4.1. Aircrews will store weapons and ammunition in the most secure facility
       available, normally the base armory.
       7.13.4.2. In the event a secure facility is unavailable:
           7.13.4.2.1. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft
           gun box.
           7.13.4.2.2. Stage aircrews should contact C2 for guidance.
   7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
       7.13.5.1. Weapons should not normally be unloaded.
       7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key.
   7.13.6. Crewmembers will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
   termination at home station.
   7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew
   member; place the weapon on a flat surface.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.

   available. If landing airport has a USAF airfield management function, submit completed AF
   Form 651 to the airfield management officer for forwarding to the wing safety office. If
   landing airport does not have an airfield management office, notify the safety office of the
   Air Force base nearest to location where the condition occurred, PIC’s home base safety
   office, or as prescribed by overseas MAJCOM. In that case, provide contact sufficient
   information to prepare AF Form 651.
   8.3.4. Grant individuals who submit a HATR immunity from disciplinary action provided:
       8.3.4.1. If they were the offending party, their violation was not deliberate.
       8.3.4.2. They committed no criminal offense.
       8.3.4.3. Their actions did not result in a mishap.
       8.3.4.4. They properly reported the incident using procedures above.

  PIC, fuel does or potentially will hit the ground, the PIC shall notify the appropriate
  installation A7 official through the local C2 agent as a potential EPCRA reportable event.
  This list is not all exhaustive. Most events require C2 agents to forward OPREP reports to
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                              137


  higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the “who, what, when, where, why, and how” of the
  incident to a C2 agency.
     8.5.5.1. The Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, covered in AFI 10-707,
     Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, establishes procedures to combat the effect
     of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference. PICs who encounter electromagnetic
     interference (EMI) will report the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon as practical.
         8.5.5.1.1. Address EMI reports to: HQ AMC SCOTT AFB IL//A63// and addressees
         listed in AFI 10-707. Send reports via electronic message format with the following
         information in plain text:

         8.5.5.1.2. C2 agents must prepare an OPREP-3 if EMI is suspected meaconing,
         intrusion, or jamming, interference sufficient to cause a hazard, or if, in the PIC’s
         judgment, the situation warrants such a report.
         8.5.5.1.3. PICs shall serve as classification authority for EMI reports. Evaluate an
         adversaries’ ability to exploit certain systems using EMI and protect information
         accordingly. PICs on a non- sensitive mission or who judge the EMI to be
         interference from a non-hostile source need not classify EMI reports unless that report
 138                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


           would reveal system vulnerability. Classify interference report(s) at stations located
           in combat areas or during sensitive military missions.
8.6. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
invoice processing, and program supervision. Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC) air card
for the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and some
military installations) worldwide. The air card is authorized for use by all U.S. government
aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government aircraft. All
PICs should plan to use the “platinum” MSC card. In most cases, there will be no changes when
refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The MSC card is
accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting merchants can
be found at https://www.airseacard.com (username and password required). It replaces the
Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card.
   8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of MSC card could
   create financial liability for the purchaser.
   8.6.2. Refuel/de-fuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations whenever possible. If DoD service is
   not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
       8.6.2.1. Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contracts.
       8.6.2.2. Foreign government air forces.
       8.6.2.3. Open market. NOTE: DoD FLIP en route supplements identify locations with
       into-plane contracts.
   8.6.3. AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures.
       8.6.3.1. The DD Form 1898, Fuel Sale Slip, is the fuel transaction receipt used for
       purchases at other DoD locations, including DFSC into-plane contract locations. Log and
       place the DD Form 1898 inside the AF Form 644, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log. The
       PIC or designated representative shall complete this form. NOTE: If the contractor
       insists on a unique invoice along with the DD Form 1898, annotate the vendor’s invoice
       with “DUPLICATE DD1898 ACCOMPLISHED.”
       8.6.3.2. The AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log, is a tool to log and store all
       AVPOL transaction forms. Record all off-station transactions on the front of the form and
       insert the original form inside the envelope. Turn in the AF Form 664, with supporting
       forms, to maintenance debriefing or as directed by local procedures. The PIC or
       designated representative shall complete this form when appropriate.
       8.6.3.3. The SF 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, may be used to purchase fuel,
       ground services and/or other authorized products when no AIR card contract is in place.
       Reference DoDM 4140.25-M Chapter 16, Government Fuel Card Program Management
       Office DoD Fleet Card, Air Card®, and Sea Card® for detailed instructions.
       8.6.3.4. Purchasing Aviation Fuel in Canada. The DoD and Canadian Department of
       National Defense have signed a memorandum of understanding allowing DoD aircraft to
       use the DD1896, when refueling at Canadian airfields with a Canadian National Defense
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                139


     Contract (CNDC). Use the AIR for fuel purchases at Canadian airports without a CNDC,
     and for ground handling services at all Canadian airports.
     8.6.3.5. Use host country forms to effect purchases at foreign military airfields, including
     “replacement-in-kind” locations. Hand scribe information from aircraft identaplate on the
     local form. Log and place a copy inside the AF Form 664.
     8.6.3.6. DD Form 791, Aerial Tanker In-Flight Issue Log, is used to log in-flight offload
     of fuel. The DD Form 791 can be submitted as a paper copy or electronically IAW local
     procedures. Except for gallons transferred, fill out all blocks on the form. Use eight digit
     tail numbers for the tanker and receivers. For Navy and Marine receivers, use six digit
     bureau number. Log and place a copy inside the AF Form 664 and turn it in IAW local
     procedures.
     8.6.3.7. AF Form 1994, Fuels Issue/Defuel Document, is used to record fuel purchases at
     USAF bases using a valid DD1896. The PIC or designated representative shall complete
     the form then log and place a copy inside the AF Form 664.
     8.6.3.8. AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
     Document, is used to record POL actions for a particular airframe IAW applicable
     directives. The PIC or designated representative shall complete the form and submit to
     maintenance debrief.
     8.6.3.9. DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate, is the aircraft fuel and oil charge card.
     8.6.3.10. The PIC will verify the AFTO Form 781H is completed and turned in to
     maintenance debriefing following the mission.
     8.6.3.11. For off-station missions, the PIC will complete or verify accuracy of the AF
     Forms 15, 315, 664, AFTO Form 781H, DD Form 1898, and associated fuels receipts
     then place them in the AF Form 664 (use eight digits for all USAF aircraft tail number
     entries). The PIC will transmit all AF Form 664 information via phone, fax, or message if
     mission causes him/her to be off-station past the last day of the month.
     8.6.3.12. Aircrew Responsibilities.
        8.6.3.12.1. Pilots will accurately record fueling actions on the AFTO Form 781H.
            8.6.3.12.1.1. Receiver capable aircraft will record fuel onloads using AFI Form
            664. Record issuing tanker’s refueling information (i.e., tail number, unit of
            assignment, and home station.).
            8.6.3.12.1.2. Boom operators will:
                8.6.3.12.1.2.1. Collect all pertinent information to document in-flight refuel
                operation to include, receiver aircraft MDS, unit of assignment, and home
                station. Obtain information from flying schedule prior to flight,
                verbally/visually during flight, or by any means following flight. NOTE:
                Boom operators may submit an incomplete DD Form 791 only after
                exhausting all means to obtain the required data. In those cases, boom
                operators must include a brief explanation as to why the data is missing. Unit
                commanders will develop a local procedure to collect required information
                prior to the form’s final processing.
 140                                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


           8.6.3.12.2. Prior to fuel offload, get receiver aircraft’s tail number (use interplane
           radio, boom interphone, or visually if open communication would compromise the
           mission during clandestine or covert operations or threaten safety of flight). When
           refueling the same receiver multiple times on a single mission, enter a separate line
           on the DD Form791 for each AAR. NOTE: EMCON 2 or 3 training does not
           disqualify inter-plane radio to obtain or verify AAR data.
           8.6.3.12.3. Do not use “known/suspected” aircraft serial number that belongs to unit
           being fueled, but not necessarily the actual aircraft getting fuel. Auditors compare
           receiver unit aircraft serial numbers with fuel load reports at home station. If
           “known/suspected” aircraft tail number billed is incorrect (down for
           maintenance/unable to fly), the auditor will reject the fuel bill and the tanker unit is
           liable for the cost of the fuel transferred.
           8.6.3.12.4. Comply with locally established procedures to complete DD Form 791
           for classified in-flight refuelings.
       8.6.3.13. Maintenance technicians will:
           8.6.3.13.1. Prior to off-station mission or deployment, maintenance technicians will
           obtain sufficient fuels transaction forms to complete the deployment. Unless directed
           otherwise by the PIC, accurately complete all ground refueling/de-fueling documents
           and place them inside the AF Form 664.
       8.6.3.14. Wing scheduling will:
           8.6.3.14.1. Provide a member to the AVPOL advisory group.
           8.6.3.14.2. By the 7th of each month, prepare monthly report for invoice control
           officer (ICO). Include organization (squadron), MDS, programmed flying hours for
           previous and current months in the report.
           8.6.3.14.3. Include receivers’ MDS, command of assignment, unit or squadron,
           DoDAAC for USAF receivers, UIC for USN receivers, POC name, phone number,
           and home station name (for each in-flight refueling sortie) on the weekly schedule.
           8.6.3.14.4. Compose and transmit classified messages for classified in-flight
           refuelings to HQ AMC/A47 IAW AFM 67-1, Vol 1, part 3, Supply/Fuels Wartime
           Planning, attachment 34.
           8.6.3.14.5. Maintain the wing’s current master list of receiver unit POCs and
           telephone numbers.

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
                 NUCLEAR THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations
of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRN threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated
environment.
10.2. Understanding the CBRN Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or absorb
   into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5 percent
   bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of removing
   chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in “flu-like symptoms” is
   actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called “dirty
   bomb,” is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   initial radiation, and residual fallout. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a
   nuclear detonation can damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of
   shielding, distance from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
10.3. CBRN Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRN attack. Passive defense measures
include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRN threat through
contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                149


  10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
  defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: inflight diversion,
  survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
  equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
     10.3.1.1. Inflight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRN
     attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
     at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
     controlling OPORD.
     10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
     reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
     aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
     the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just landed
     or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down engines
     and avoid running environmental control systems. Close aircraft doors/hatches, don
     Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal protective cover on the base. If
     time does not permit using base facilities, and the attack is a missile attack, remain in the
     sealed aircraft for a minimum of one-hour after the attack and/or follow host-base
     guidance.
     10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
     contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
     and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
     contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
     the senior transportation commander.
  10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
  protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.
  Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and
  hardening of facilities.
     10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. Aircrew Chemical Biological, Radiological,
     Nuclear (ACBRN) protective equipment contained in D-Bags is the in-flight protective
     gear for aircrew members. Aircrew CBRN equipment includes Aircrew Eye-Respiratory
     Protection (AERP) mask or Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM), filter blower and
     communication unit for above the shoulder protection. Below the shoulder protection is
     provided by CWU-66/P Aircrew Chemical Ensemble (ACE), butyl gloves, and cotton
     inserts. The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists items in the C-Bag, including a
     protective mask (MCU-2A/P or M50 Series), C2 series canister/M50 series filter (as
     applicable for each type of mask), an over garment, boots, and gloves. The ACBRN
     equipment and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents. They do
     not provide nuclear blast protection. However they do provide limited protection from
     radiological particulates as well as low level radiation from an RDD. Aircrew CBRN
     equipment requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures and AFE
     expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination Control Area (ACCA).
     NOTE: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A or M50 series ground crew mask. NOTE:
     ACDE issue requirements can also be found in the current Operations Order (OPORD)
     and/or Special Instructions (SPINS) for specific contingency operations.”
150                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


         10.3.2.1.1. ACBRN/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACBRN equipment
         and GCE at home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACBRN equipment and GCE
         are available at all times while in a CBRN threat area. Aircrew members will confirm
         the mobility bag contents and correct sizes.
         10.3.2.1.2. ACBRN Equipment Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft
         contamination is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations represent the
         highest threat to aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid
         chemical agents is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only,
         and separate ground duties from air duties.
      10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
      contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
      such as the ACBRN equipment. The basic concept for most facility collective protective
      solutions is to employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to
      provide rest and relief accommodations, as well as provide medical treatment in
      contamination free zone. Crewmembers should avail themselves of facilities, if provided,
      on the airfield.
      10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
      strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
      reduce the potential of vapor exposure in facilities without collective protection; seal
      windows and doors, turn off HVAC systems, and use room above the first floor when
      possible.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
  Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
  performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
      10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
      practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
      measures.
      10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
         10.3.3.2.1. Inflight Decontamination. Air washing is a useful inflight
         decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
         surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
         characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
         screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
         altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
         (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
         around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
         into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is
         recommended. Follow smoke and fume elimination procedures to help purge interior
         contamination.
         10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
         equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  151


          assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
          government control.
      10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility
      Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a
      method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
      limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
      environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
      the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
      flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
      exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
      or vice versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
      through HQ AMC/A3X.
10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN
   weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should emphasize
   ACBRN equipment wear, crew coordination, CBRN hazards and countermeasures, inflight
   diversion, plans for onload/offload in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return
   leg in the event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be
   considered in the event MOPP conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The 618 AOC (TACC) or theater C2 agency
   (normally through the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as
   medical pre-treatment for chemical/biological exposure or issue of dosimetry for potential
   radiological hazards.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACBRN equipment will require use of the aircraft oxygen
   system to counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting
   offers the greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir
   levels must be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to
   calculate the required reservoir levels.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACBRN equipment based on the alarm
   condition (See Airman’s Manual (AFPAM 10-100). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures,
   and refer the locally developed donning checklist contained in the D-Bag, to ensure proper
   wear. When wearing the ACBRN equipment, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors
   will be kept in the upper left ACBRN equipment pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body
   armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower
   right flight suit pocket. This standardized location will enable personnel to locate the
 152                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   medication should an individual be overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight
   suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper
   should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN threat area or when an alarm
   “yellow” or higher has been declared. When inbound to a CBRN threat area, prior to descent,
   the aircraft commander will ensure crew and passengers don appropriate protective
   equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRN
   threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen
   requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations,
   and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the wear of the integrated survival
   vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a
   safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the
   items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the
   aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-Line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-flight
   crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a covered vehicle.
   Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to prevent contamination
   spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they will require assistance
   from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective overcape and overboots
   prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags and properly marked IAW technical order requirements. Aircrew members entering the
   aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape portions of the aircrew ensemble and
   ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to
   entering the aircraft all personnel should implement boot wash/decontamination procedures.
   Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated environment will don plastic overboots and
   overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACBRN equipment, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker
   or the aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as
   required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from a
   contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                               153


    theater war plans. Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
    aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
    the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
    shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
    of the senior transportation commander.
    10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
    ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
    passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
    contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
    aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. NOTE: An altitude below
    10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.
    10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
    resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACBRN equipment. The aircraft commander
    should consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission
    requirements when determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be
    closely monitored for adverse physiological effects.
    10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize thermal
    stress caused by wearing the ACBRN equipment. Aircrews must weigh all factors when
    performing in-flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing
    full GCE, and may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACBRN
    equipment. More on this subject may be found in AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological,
    Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards.

NOTES:
If wearing MOPP 4, add 10ºF to Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). If wearing personal
body armor in humid climates, add 5ºF to WBGT.
Rest means minimal physical activity (sitting or standing), accomplished in shade if possible.
Caution: Daily fluid intake should not exceed 12 quarts. Hourly fluid intake should not exceed 1
quart. The work/rest time and fluid replacement volumes will sustain performance and hydration
for at least 4 hours of work in the specified work category. Individual water needs will vary ±¼
quart/ hour.
NL=no limit to work time per hour.

   10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACBRN equipment should only be removed if there is
   absolutely no vapor hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable
   levels of currently fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The
   aircrew must take every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on
   the flight deck area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid
   those areas for the remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an
   aircrew member or passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel
   aboard the aircraft will stay in full ACBRN equipment/GCE until processed through their
   respective contamination control area (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be
   parked in an isolated area and cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
   in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.
   10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
       10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
       whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
       seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
       chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
       10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort
       (i.e. leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated
       equipment. Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  155


        may still be present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact with
        agent residue is avoided.
        10.5.10.3. Table 10.2 shows times associated with initial and follow-on phases of the
        10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to use the worst
        case scenario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for the initial
        phase and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

                                            Chapter 11

                                NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures and requirements for worldwide enroute
KC-135 navigation. It is to be used in conjunction with procedures and requirements set forth in
AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, FLIP and applicable FAA and/or ICAO procedures and
instructions. Since airspace and associated navigational aid equipment capability are rapidly
evolving, pilots must maintain an in depth knowledge of current requirements/policies. For
Navigator responsibilities (SOAR and Non-SOAR) during 4-person operations see paragraph
6.60
   11.1.1. Prolonged Loss of Contact. Aircrews must ensure they are following proper
   navigation crosscheck procedures to maintain airspace situational awareness.
       11.1.1.1. Aircrews will use navigation charts to identify radio frequency changeover
       points to minimize the likelihood of prolonged loss of communication with ATC/radio
       operators. Additionally, crews must monitor both VHF and UHF Guard to the maximum
       extent possible.
       11.1.1.2. In the event of known or suspected loss of two-way radio capability, aircrews
       shall change their transponder mode 3/A to 7600. Squawking 7600 highlights the loss of
       two-way radio capability to ATC/radio operators and minimizes the risk of being
       intercepted.
       11.1.1.3. In cases of suspected loss of contact with ATC, attempt to reestablish contact
       using other aircraft to relay messages to ATC controllers.
11.2. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP, for further
guidance). US Military aircraft and DoD personnel entering another nation to conduct US
government business must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to enter their
airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are obtained through US officials
known as Defense Attaché Officers (DAOs).
   11.2.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial
   airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states' territorial seas.
   Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal state.
   Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters, inland
   waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be conducted in such
   areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
   11.2.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12NMs.
   Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
   operating in international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be
   provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established by
   the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims beyond
   12NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish limits, which
   differ from the standard.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  157


   11.2.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). A FIR is an area of airspace within which flight
   information and related services are provided. An FIR does not reflect international borders
   or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without approval of the
   adjacent country, provided the PIC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
   11.2.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace into
   territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not amend
   entry point(s).
   11.2.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
   departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a clearance
   has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
   11.2.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
   penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
   country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
   11.2.7. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts to
   negate existing clearances, PICs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response will
   be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to planned destination,
   as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in international airspace." Safety of
   flight is paramount in determining mission continuation. Under no circumstances should
   aircrews construe a clearance, which routes their mission over sovereign airspace, which was
   not approved through diplomatic channels before mission departure, as being valid
   authorization.
   11.2.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing will
   normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility transited
   before performing the critical portion of the mission.
   11.2.9. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked to
   and will not fly "due regard" routings unless coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM C2
   and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or "operational" option
   obligates the military PIC to be their own ATC agency to separate their aircraft from all other
   air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, PICs may exercise the "due regard" option to
   protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air traffic services as soon as practical.
   Refer to FLIP GP for additional guidance on due regard.
11.3. Navigation Databases.
   11.3.1. Flight Planning Navigation Database. Flight plans created using the Advanced
   Computer Flight Plan (ACFP) or the Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS) use the
   navigation date from the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF). Pilots are
   responsible for ensuring the accuracy of flight plan waypoints against current aeronautical
   charts, terminal instrument procedures, or FLIP documents (i.e. AP/1B). These flight plans
   may be saved to a PCMIA card and loaded directly into the FMS using the FMS data loader.
      11.3.1.1. If a suspected error is found in the DAFIF database, immediately report it to the
      unit system support representative (SSR). The SSR acts as a filter by determining if the
      issue is a DAFIF, FMS, or an AWE, error and reports it to the appropriate agency. When
      away from home station, relay information to the SSR via unit OGV.
 158                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   11.3.2. Aircraft Navigation Database. The FMS uses a navigation database provided by the
   National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). This database is stored on a PCMIA card
   that is uploaded into the FMS prior to flight.
11.4. Flight Planning.
   11.4.1. Normally, mission planning is accomplished and verified while still in a flight
   planning facility/base operations and then electronically or manually transferred to the
   aircraft flight management systems. Use the latest weather and waypoint description
   information for this planning.
   11.4.2. Prior to filing a flight plan, verify computer products and overprinted flight planning
   forms with current charts and FLIP, as well as NOTAMs, organized track messages, etc. If a
   computer flight plan is not available, complete flight planning and print an AFMSS flight
   plan or other approved form for in-flight use as a navigation and fuel management log.
   11.4.3. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official source of performance,
   navigation and climatic data, including en route wind information. If stand-alone computer
   based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Use only
   MAJCOM validated CFPs.
       11.4.3.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually
       compute flight plans. PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy & diplomatic
       clearance compliance.
       11.4.3.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.
       Pass any flight plan discrepancies to the C2 flight planning office. On flight-managed
       sorties, promptly notify the flight manager of any flight plan discrepancies, to ensure the
       correct route of flight is filed with air traffic control. Identify inaccurate CFP winds to
       618 AOC (TACC)/XOCM if the average wind for a route segment exceeds either 30°
       error in direction or 25 knots in speed.
11.5. Navigation Capability / Airspace Requirements.
   11.5.1. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM). Airspace where RVSM is applied
   is considered special qualification airspace. See FLIP GP for aircraft equipment
   requirements. Both the operator and the specific aircraft must be approved for operations in
   these areas. Always refer to the appropriate Area Planning (AP) publication for specific
   theater RVSM requirements.
       11.5.1.1. Operations in RVSM airspace. In addition to the requirements established in
       the applicable AP publication, always comply with the following when operating in
       RVSM airspace:
          11.5.1.1.1. Both primary altimeters, the autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and
          the transponder, must be fully operational. Request a new clearance to avoid this
          airspace should any of this equipment fail.
          11.5.1.1.2. Engage the autopilot during level cruise, except when circumstances such
          as the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.
          11.5.1.1.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out. Record
          readings of both altimeters.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                               159


         11.5.1.1.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ±
         200 feet.
         11.5.1.1.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating
         near ther aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
         11.5.1.1.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry
         into RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
         11.5.1.1.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM
         required equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RVSM
         tolerances.
         11.5.1.1.8. In the North Atlantic Region, Minimum Navigation Performance
         Specification (MNPS) airspace is a subdivision of RVSM airspace. Refer to FLIP
         AP/2, paragraph 11.5.2, and the North Atlantic MNPSA Operations Manual for
         detailed requirements when operating in MNPS airspace.
  11.5.2. Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) Operations.
     11.5.2.1. Operations within the North Atlantic area’s MNPS airspace, Canadian MNPS,
     or selected Pacific routes are designed for INS-auto-pilot coupled operation. (See FLIP
     AP/2, and AFI 11-202V3). When not engaged in AAR operations, aircrews will adhere
     to these procedures. Comply with FLIP for operations in North Atlantic Minimum
     Navigation Performance Specification Airspace, and US West Coast to Hawaii Route
     System Procedures.
     11.5.2.2. Malfunctioning equipment that reduces the aircrew’s capability to comply with
     MNPS, whether occurring prior to, or within MNPS airspace, will immediately be
     reported to the controlling agency and subsequent agencies throughout the route of flight.
     Prior to airspace entry, aircrews will return to the nearest maintenance repair facility
     unless the aircraft has a minimum of two operable and correctly functioning INUs, unless
     specifically cleared to proceed along original, or revised routing by the controlling
     agency. If subsequent failures occur, advise ARTCC, comply with track restrictions, and
     use all means available (HF DR, dead reckoning, etc) to ensure navigation accuracy.
     11.5.2.3. When flying in MNPS airspace, exercise special caution to ensure the
     coordinates of the assigned track and associated landfall and domestic routings are fully
     understood and correctly inserted into the automatic DR navigation system with
     appropriate cross-checks. If at any time the route (re-routing, if appropriate) is in doubt,
     check the details with ARTCC facility.
     11.5.2.4. When flying in MNPS airspace, crews will utilize Strategic Lateral Offset
     Procedures (SLOP) to the max extent possible. Refer to the MNPS Manual and AFI 11-
     217V1 for further information on SLOP.
  11.5.3. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Airspace where RNP is applied
  is considered special qualification airspace and can be determined by referencing the
  applicable theater AP publication. The PIC is responsible for a thorough review of the
  aircraft forms and maintenance logs to ascertain the status of RNP equipment. During flight,
  immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into RNP airspace
 160                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   and coordinate a plan of action. Document in the aircraft forms, malfunctions or failures of
   RNP required equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RNP tolerances.
       11.5.3.1. Aircrews will set steering solutions to INU1/GPS (Pilot) and INU2/GPS
       (Copilot) in Civil Mode unless directed otherwise for specific operations or missions.
       KC-135 aircraft with properly functioning steering solutions comply with all civil
       navigation performance requirements for Required Navigation Performance Area
       Navigation (RNP RNAV) RNP-10, RNP-4, RNP-2 RNAV, RNP-1 RNAV, Time of
       Arrival Control (TOAC), Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV), Precision Area Navigation
       (PRNAV), and Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM). GPS1/A/H (Pilot) and
       GPS2/A/H (Copilot) will serve as a secondary steering solution.
           11.5.3.1.1. Required Navigation Performance (RNP)-0.3 Area Navigation (RNAV)
           operations are supported with the following autopilot and flight director restriction.
           While conducting RNP-0.3 operations, the flight director system must be used and the
           flight crew must manually verify that the navigation data display is consistent with
           the FLIP.
11.6. En route Navigation Procedures.
   11.6.1. Navigation Systems Crosscheck.
       11.6.1.1. As a minimum, pilots should obtain a navigation system crosscheck every 30
       minutes during cruise. Update automatic navigation computers as necessary to ensure the
       computer present position remains within 5 NM of the actual aircraft position. This
       update requirement does not apply to malfunctioning automatic DR equipment that is not
       being used for navigation.
   11.6.2. Navigation Charts.
       11.6.2.1. Maintain an in-flight chart for all missions which depart the airport traffic area.
       Use the chart to assist with in-flight navigation.
       11.6.2.2. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the
       chart.
   11.6.3. Air Traffic Rules.
       11.6.3.1. This section provides guidance for aircrews operating worldwide. See FLIP
       General Planning, the Foreign Clearance Guide, FAA Handbook 7610.4, and AFI 11-
       202V3 for additional requirements or restrictions.
       11.6.3.2. Unless authorized by the controlling agency, aircraft operating in controlled
       airspace under IFR on all routes published or unpublished, must fly along a direct course
       between NAVAIDS or fixes defining the route (AFI 11-202V3). Deviations will only be
       approved by the controlling agency or when operating in special-use airspace or on
       Military Training Routes (MTRs).
       11.6.3.3. In civilian airspace, crews may use GPS precise positioning service (PPS)
       civilian mode. Crews will not operate in Mil mode unless specifically authorized by
       MAJCOM/A3V or DIRMOBFOR message.
11.7. Oceanic Flight. Maintaining situational awareness during oceanic flight is essential to the
safe conduct of the flight. Situational awareness includes, but is not limited to, positional
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 161


awareness and accurate fuel updates. This requires due diligence on the part of all aircrew
members. NOTE: The following information also applies to extended flight in non-radar
environments where position reporting is required. NOTE: Use of the MNPS checklist is
mandatory and all items will be interpreted as “will” instead of “should.” When appropriate,
units may augment the MNPS checklist with local supplements for items such as ALTRV,
formation, and other unique mission requirements.
   11.7.1. Oceanic Plotting Charts.
       11.7.1.1. Prior to flight, plot the oceanic portion of the flight on an appropriate chart.
       Annotate the chart with the mission number, aircraft commander's name, preparer’s
       name, and date. If practical, chart may be reused.
       11.7.1.2. Obtain a coast out fix prior to, or immediately on entering the Class II Route or
       over- water segment. Perform a gross error check using available NAVAIDS and
       annotate the position and time on the chart.
       11.7.1.3. When approaching each waypoint on a Category I Route, recheck coordinates
       for the next waypoints.
       11.7.1.4. Approximately 10 minutes after passing each oceanic waypoint, record and plot
       the aircraft position and time on the chart, and ensure compliance with courses and ETA
       tolerances.
       11.7.1.5. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the
       chart.
       11.7.1.6. Upon return to home station, turn in the charts (copies if reused) and applicable
       computer flight plans to the squadron or applicable mission planning office. Squadrons
       will retain the charts, computer flight plans, and associated materials for a minimum of 3
       months.
   11.7.2. Inertial Navigation System.
       11.7.2.1. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor mission computer
       navigation performance. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation
       capability, which degrades centerline accuracy to the controlling ARTCC. Use the
       following procedures for flight progress:
       11.7.2.2. Steering should be through FMS pilot’s steering source-autopilot tie-in except
       when conducting AAR.
       11.7.2.3. At intervals not to exceed 30 minutes compare present position coordinates for
       each INU (pure and GPS-mixed positions).
       11.7.2.4. Should one or both INUs become inoperative or INU positions noticeably
       separate determine the most accurate navigation system using all available NAVAIDS
       (i.e. MAJCOM- approved GPS). Utilize steering solution of INU determined to be the
       most accurate.
   11.7.3. Differences Between Navigation Systems. When there is a difference between the
   INUs and GPS systems, normally two of the three will be in close proximity. This will help
   to determine which navigation system is becoming inaccurate. When available, check
   position using available ground NAVAIDS. If divergence has been gradual, it should have
162                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


  been determined which INU is accurate, then follow one unit inoperative procedure. If
  divergence has been sudden, check groundspeed function, as abnormal readouts would
  indicate a faulty INU. If unable to determine which INS unit is in error, follow two units
  inoperative procedure.
      11.7.3.1. One INU unit inoperative:
         11.7.3.1.1. Advise ARTCC.
         11.7.3.1.2. Plot position on navigation chart every 30 minutes.
         11.7.3.1.3. Check the accuracy of remaining INU, using all available NAVAIDS
         (VOR/DME, GPS, and radar).
      11.7.3.2. Two units inoperative:
         11.7.3.2.1. Advise ARTCC.
         11.7.3.2.2. Crosscheck system heading with mission plan at waypoint or every 30
         minutes.
         11.7.3.2.3. Verify last recorded position on chart.
         11.7.3.2.4. Use computer flight plan as guide.
         11.7.3.2.5. Use TACAN, VOR/DME, and ground map radar to update positions.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                              163

                 AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES

12.1. General. This chapter contains aircrew procedures not contained in the flight manual,
other portions of this AFI, or other publications.
12.2. Responsibilities. Aircrews may assist the normal maintenance function when critical
contingency tasking dictate their use, provided this action does not impact crew duty and crew
rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI.
12.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. Pilots are not authorized to clear a Red X. If a situation is
encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are not
available to clear it, the PIC may obtain authorization to clear the Red X from the home station
MXG/CC or designated representative, in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1. Other crew members
are not authorized to clear a Red X. EXCEPTION: The PIC may clear Red Xs for engine covers,
pitot covers and gear pins when qualified maintenance personnel are not available, unless
prohibited by the home station MXG/CC or OG/CC.
12.4. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. Aircrews are normally not required to
service the aircraft, however, aircrew members current in aircraft servicing (G190) may augment
qualified refueling supervisors. The aircraft servicing course does not qualify crews to perform
maintenance tasks. Aircrew members are not authorized to serve as refueling supervisors, only
qualified transient alert and maintenance personnel may serve as refueling supervisors.
   12.4.1. Avoid refueling with JP-8+100 while transiting airfields with JP-8+100 capabilities.
   AMC aircraft are not allowed to operate on JP-8+100, except in emergency conditions. All
   JP-8+100 locations are required to maintain a clean JP-8 capability to support transient
   aircraft. If inadvertent refueling with JP-8+100 occurs comply with the following:
       12.4.1.1. De-fuel the aircraft prior to next flight.
       12.4.1.2. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry stating “Caution: Aircraft refueled using JP-
       8+100, preventative measures must be taken when de-fueling.”
   12.4.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Concurrent ground operations (simultaneous
   refueling or defueling while maintenance operations are being performed) will be in
   accordance with TO 00-25-172 and applicable KC-135 2-2 series maintenance technical
   orders for approved concurrent maintenance actions.
       12.4.2.1. Movement into or within the safe area must be under control of the chief
       servicing supervisor (CSS). Individuals must properly ground themselves before
       boarding the aircraft or handling fuel-servicing equipment.
12.5. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). When an aircraft will
land at a base other than the MOB, a crew chief should accompany the aircraft. The PIC is
responsible for ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings.
   12.5.1. The PIC is responsible for the recovery items including:
       12.5.1.1. Parking and receiving.
       12.5.1.2. Aircraft servicing, including Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) usage.

      12.5.1.3. Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability.
      12.5.1.4. Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking.
      12.5.1.5. Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest.
      12.5.1.6. Coordinating aircraft security requirements.
      12.5.1.7. Documenting AFTO 781-series forms.
  12.5.2. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those
  instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash
  symbol in the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
  Document, updating current status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that
  reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e. preflight, thru-flight, basic post-
  flight) is overdue.
  12.5.3. Lightning strike. Dash-6 inspections following a lightning strike must be performed
  by maintenance personnel trained in KC-135 maintenance.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                   165

                 CARGO AND PASSENGER HANDLING PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The PIC or BO is responsible for assuring all cargo is properly secured in
compliance with T.O. 1C-135-9. Regardless of passenger seating, all cargo and the Palletized
Airline Seating Pallet will be secured using 3G forward restraint criteria. Certain items may
require additional restraint based on ASC/ENFC certification.
   13.1.1. The BO coordinates on/offloading with air terminal operations or shipping agencies,
   plans loads, supervises on/offloading operations, performs pre/postflight checks of aircraft
   and systems, computes aircraft weight and balance, ensures safety and comfort of passengers
   and troops, and security of cargo, mail, and baggage during flight.
13.2. Responsibilities Aircraft Loading.
   13.2.1. AMC Designated Stations.
       13.2.1.1. Aerial port personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift,
       promptly completing documentation, palletizing cargo, load planning (as required),
       computing load distribution and moving cargo to and from the aircraft to meet scheduled
       departure. Before starting loading operations, they will advise the PIC (or designated
       representative) of destination, size, weight, and types of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.)
       to permit proper positioning. They will also coordinate traffic activities affecting on/off
       loading activity, and assign sufficient aerial port loading personnel for cargo handling.
       Aerial port personnel are responsible for safe positioning of material handling equipment
       (MHE) and cargo to or from the aircraft cargo door. Under the supervision of the BO,
       aerial port personnel will prepare the aircraft for loading, stow loading/tiedown
       equipment if the aircraft is not to be reloaded, physically load the aircraft, tie down cargo
       and equipment, release tie down and physically offload cargo.
       13.2.1.2. The BO is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning (as required),
       certifying load plans, preparing weight and balance documentation, completing all
       required load/tipping computations, operating aircraft equipment and cargo tie down.
       They coordinate with the loading crew supervisor to verify cargo against load plan and
       manifests. The BO supervises loading operations and is responsible for safe movement of
       cargo into and out of the aircraft. The BO will notify the PIC, C2, or terminal operations
       officer if loading personnel are injured or cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure
       is damaged during on/offloading. The BO will brief the PIC on any hazardous cargo and
       cargo jettison capability prior to engine start.
          13.2.1.2.1. Responsibility for Customs Procedures. Unless otherwise directed, use
          the Foreign Clearance Guide, the AMC Aircrew Border Clearance Guide, and
          Chapter 6 of this directive for specific inbound/outbound customs requirements.
       13.2.1.3. Loads planned by qualified load planners will normally be accepted by the BO
       and loaded aboard the aircraft as planned, unless the load, or any portion of it, will
       compromise flight safety or does not comply with applicable aircraft technical orders or
       USAF/MAJCOM publications. If cargo is refused or rearranged for these reasons,
       forward all applicable information, including a copy of the load plan, to HQ AMC/A3VK
 166                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


       through Stan/Eval channels. AMC units will include AMC Form 54, Aircraft
       Commander's Report On Services/Facilities. EXCEPTION: The BO may deviate from
       load plans only to facilitate ease of on/offloading of cargo and to alleviate unnecessary
       aircraft reconfiguration. The BO must take into consideration the next station’s cargo
       configuration requirements and will ensure the aircraft is in proper weight and balance
       limits.
       13.2.1.4. The BO is the on-scene expert for load planning and accepting cargo for airlift.
       Some loads are not specifically detailed in applicable directives and may require the BO
       to seek advice of other personnel (i.e., available boom operators, squadron, group, wing
       or HQ AMC/A3VK evaluators) or use their best judgment, based on training, experience,
       and knowledge, to determine the safest and most efficient method of cargo loading.
          13.2.1.4.1. Non-standard cargo/equipment not contained in the aircraft loading
          manual may require certification for air shipment. The shipper will provide a copy of
          the certification to the BO prior to loading. If the certification letter with loading
          instructions/requirements is not provided to the BO, the cargo will not be loaded.
          Contact Air Transportability Test Loading Agency (ATTLA) or ASC/ENFC at
          Wright Patterson AFB, OH, voicemail (937) 255-2330/2547 or MAJCOM Stan/Eval
          for questions concerning cargo certification.
          13.2.1.4.2. Maintenance is responsible for the upload and configuration of (daily)
          training mission equipment and cargo roller systems. Maintenance is responsible for
          uploading and assisting O with configuration of additional equipment needed per AFI
          11-2KC-135 V3, Addenda A. BO must ensure all equipment has been properly
          configured/secured and accomplish a cargo roller system preflight (if installed) prior
          to departure. Aircraft equipment must be inventoried and configured IAW T.O. 1C-
          135-21, Equipment Inventory List All -135 Series Aircraft, AFI 11-2KC-135 V3,
          C/KC-135V3, Addenda A and T.O. 1C-135-9, Cargo Loading Manual.
          13.2.1.4.3. Sufficient cargo handling and securing equipment must be on board each
          KC-135 to properly secure all planned cargo items from home station and items listed
          in departure and pre- departure messages.
   13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities in paragraph 13.2.1.1 and provides sufficient qualified personnel and MHE
   for on/offloading. BO’s responsibilities and authority are the same as described in paragraph
   13.2.1.2 and 13.2.1.3
   13.2.3. During Joint Airborne Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), Special Assignment
   Airlift Mission (SAAM), USAF mobility, and contingency missions, the BO can accept DD
   Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, as a valid pre-inspection of equipment being
   offered for air shipment. This form, validated by two joint inspector signatures (user and
   transporting force), may be used in lieu of the applicable portions of the T.O. 1C-135-9.
   However, this does not relieve the BO from ensuring accompanying loads are secured prior
   to takeoff. The DD Form 2133 will not be used to document preparation of hazardous
   materials. This will be accomplished using the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                   167


   13.3.1. Passengers, troops and crew must have ready access to emergency exits. Load
   aircraft in such a manner that at least one unobstructed safety aisle in the cargo compartment
   allows movement from the crew compartment to the aft escape hatch and access to cargo for
   fire-fighting. NOTE: All passenger hand-carried items must be of a size to fit under the seat
   and must not obstruct the safety aisle(s). Any items that do not fit under a seat or obstruct an
   aisle way, will be stowed with checked baggage and secured for flight.
   13.3.2. Aisle requirement. A safety aisle is defined as a minimum 14 inch-wide space
   extending from the aircraft fuselage or the edge of the extended canvas troop seat to the
   vertical stacking line of the cargo and is sufficient for an individual to proceed through. If, in
   the case of centerline cargo loading with two aisles and sufficient aisle space cannot be
   maintained, passengers or cargo must be downloaded according to relative shipping priority.
   Tie-down devices are permitted, but they must not obstruct the opening or installation of
   hatches and operation of emergency gear or flap extension ports.
   13.3.3. Ensure only adult, English-speaking passengers are seated next to emergency exits.
   Do not seat any passenger with infants, children under 15 years old, or physically challenged
   persons, in seats adjacent to emergency exits. Boom operators will demonstrate emergency
   hatch operation to persons seated next to emergency exits.
13.4. Pre-Mission Duties.
   13.4.1. Cargo Missions.
      13.4.1.1. The BO, will coordinate with aerial port personnel to establishes loading times.
      Loading times differing from the normal pre-departure sequence of events will be
      established, with PIC coordination, before the BO enters crew rest. Loading time is
      governed by the type of load and complexity of loading procedures (bulk, palletized, etc.)
      not by port saturation or management of aerial port workload levels. When reporting for
      duty, the BO checks in with the air terminal operation center (ATOC) or other designated
      location to obtain load brief and assist in load planning as required. The BO will ensure a
      fully stocked and serviceable hazardous spill kit or Protective Clothing Kit (PCK) is
      onboard prior to cargo upload.
          13.4.1.1.1. Duty Boom Operator. Duty BO can be used as a means of flow control at
          stations with limited aerial port personnel and/or when units are deployed as part of
          an Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron (EARS) or tactical/contingency operation.
          They do not relieve the primary aircrew BO of aircraft preflight and cargo security
          check requirements. Duty BO ensure items loaded on aircraft do not exceed aircraft
          limitations and adequate restraint is applied to cargo to prevent movement. Duty BO
          are required to restrain cargo for flight limits. They will accomplish a basic cargo
          loading preflight and all appropriate loading preparation checklists prior to
          conducting loading operations and will ensure the flight crew receives sufficient
          copies of all required cargo load documentation. They will ensure the oncoming flight
          BO receives all required briefings on the aircraft load to include hazardous materials
          briefings. Duty BO duties require crew rest.
      13.4.1.2. Proper cargo documentation or mail documentation will accompany each load.
      A consolidated statement (manifest) will be delivered to the aircraft prior to departure
      unless one is not available due to a lack or failure of the manifest processing equipment.
 168                                                   AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


       In this case, a cargo listing or load plan with transportation control numbers (TCN) will
       accompany the load.
          13.4.1.2.1. Load Data Information (Applicable to AFRC/ANG completing 618
          TACC-directed mission). At stations where there is no mobility air transportation
          function, the aircrew will collect the required load information on each leg, and
          submit it to the first station, which has such a function. The report will be submitted
          on AF Form 4075, Aircraft Load Data Worksheet.
       13.4.1.3. Make every effort to exchange tiedown equipment on a one-for-one basis. If
       this is not possible, annotate the AF Form 4069, Tiedown Equipment Checklist. At non-
       AMC stations, 463L pallets will normally be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.
13.5. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo.
   13.5.1. PICs will comply with AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials For
   Military Air Shipments, AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures For Aircraft Carrying
   Hazardous Materials, when carrying hazardous cargo.
   13.5.2. AMCH 11-214, AMC Aircrew Hazardous Material Handbook, contains a description
   of the types and classes of hazardous cargo that may be carried. AMC and AMC-gained PICs
   are responsible for ensuring that all procedures contained in AMCH 11-214 are complied
   with when airlifting hazardous cargo.
       13.5.2.1. For more information regarding hazardous materials, refer to AFMAN 24-204.
   13.5.3. Flight Planning. Based on the Hazardous Cargo Briefing, the PIC will:
       13.5.3.1. Enter "Hazardous Cargo" and the mission identifier or flight number in the
       appropriate section of the flight plan. Use Remarks section of DD175, Military Flight
       Plan, and Other Information section of DD Form 1801, International Flight Plan, DOD.
       Refer to the FCG for country specific requirements concerning over-flight when
       transporting hazardous materials cargo.
       13.5.3.2. IAW with the requirements in AMCH 11-214, annotate “Hazardous Cargo” on
       flight plans when any amount of the following is transported:
          13.5.3.2.1. Division 1.1 through 1.3 explosives.
          13.5.3.2.2. Division 1.4 explosives which transit United Kingdom or Italy.
          13.5.3.2.3. Toxic chemical ammunition (Compatibility Group K).
          13.5.3.2.4. Highly toxic substances.
          13.5.3.2.5. Division 6.2 infectious substances which require technical escorts and/or
          special protective equipment.
          13.5.3.2.6. Nuclear weapons.
          13.5.3.2.7. Class 7 Radioactive Material (Yellow III label).
          13.5.3.2.8. All other hazardous materials, except Class 9 and ORM-D when
          aggregate gross weight exceeds 1,000 pounds (454 kg).
   13.5.4. If possible, plan the flight to minimize overflying heavily populated or otherwise
   critical areas. Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                               169


   13.5.5. Prepare a departure message at stations when a C2 center is not available. The
   remarks section of the departure message will include: Class of hazardous material, DoD
   class or division for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight. If required,
   request special handling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams, etc.).
   13.5.6. If estimated time en route (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances
   preclude timely message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and
   information listed in paragraph 13.5.3.2 If available, C2 will relay required information to
   next destination.
13.6. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, Not Mission Capable Supply
(NMCS), Very, Very Important Part (VVIP), Forward Supply System (FSS) Shipments,
and Courier Material.
   13.6.1. MICAP, VVIP, sensitive cargo, courier materials, and registered mail moving within
   the normal airlift system are receipted at the on and offload stations using the air cargo
   manifest. For unit moves operated in accordance with Defense Transportation Regulation
   (DTR), Part III, Mobility, classified or sensitive cargo movement is normally manifested
   utilizing the DD Form 2130-2, or similar automated product (such as CALM or AALPS), and
   will normally be accompanied by a unit courier. However, if classified/sensitive unit cargo is
   offered without an accompanying courier, the DD Form 1907, Signature and Tally Record,
   must be used.
   13.6.2. Defense Courier Service (DCS) couriers coordinating with the PIC are authorized to
   designate officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military aircraft as couriers to
   escort and safeguard courier material when other qualified personnel are not available.
   Qualified passengers, if carried, are designated before designating crewmembers. The
   following restrictions apply:
      13.6.2.1. Primary crewmembers will not be designated couriers without the consent of
      the PIC.
      13.6.2.2. Crewmembers on aircraft scheduled to make an extended en route stop at a
      location where DCS couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated as
      couriers.
   13.6.3. During stops at en route locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are
   required to meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material.
      13.6.3.1. During unscheduled en route stops crewmembers may place courier material in
      temporary custody of the following agencies in descending order of priority.
          13.6.3.1.1. DCS courier.
          13.6.3.1.2. TOP SECRET control officer of the US armed forces.
          13.6.3.1.3. US Department of State Diplomatic Courier.
          13.6.3.1.4. US Department of State activity.
          13.6.3.1.5. US military guards.
          13.6.3.1.6. US DOD civilian guards.
 170                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   13.6.4. If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the courier material, or material
   is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, report circumstances to the nearest Defense
   Courier Station and notify the local US military commander or US Government activity.
   13.6.5. Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of
   such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. Shipments will be
   manifested separately and the manifest annotated with the words LIFE OR DEATH
   URGENCY. All shipments will be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the
   air cargo manifest or the DD1907 for unit moves. The PIC, or designated representative, will
   be briefed on the urgency of the shipment and be made the custodian during flight.
13.7. Passenger Missions. Release space available seats to the maximum extent possible unless
overriding safety, legal or security concerns prohibit space available travelers from flying on
specific missions. The only passengers on missions dedicated to DV support will be those of the
official party and those space available passengers authorized by the lead POC for the traveling
party. Authorization must be approved 24 hours in advance.
   13.7.1. Space Available Passengers. For other than revenue and White House missions,
   PICs are authorized to release space available seats on mission legs when no official
   passengers are aboard (positioning and de-positioning legs). Coordinate with C2 agency to
   release available seats to the passenger terminal. PICs are encouraged to release maximum
   space available seats subject to the following restrictions:
   13.7.2. Revenue Missions. These are missions for which the using agency (typically a
   government agency other than DoD) is reimbursing DoD for use of the aircraft. Space
   available passengers on revenue missions must be approved 24 hours in advance by USAF/
   CVAM, theater AMD or JOSAC (as appropriate) and the using agency contact officer
   through unit C2 agencies. This is essential to ensure proper funding and reimbursement.
   Consult C2 to determine mission revenue status if in doubt. Congressional Delegations
   (CODEL) are not revenue missions.
       13.7.2.1. Billing. Space available passengers on revenue missions may be subject to
       being billed commercial first-class airfare by the using agency for the applicable route,
       depending on that agency's policy. If the DV or on-board contact officer releases seats,
       aircraft commander must ensure that any additional financial liability for the passengers
       is specified by the using agency on-board contact officer. PIC will ensure passengers
       understand and agree to any reimbursement conditions prior to boarding.
   13.7.3. White House Support Missions. Space available passengers will generally not
   be permitted aboard White House support mission aircraft without express permission of HQ
   USAF/CVAM. This is normally due to the security status of the aircraft, which may include
   positioning and de-positioning legs. When it is necessary to move aircrew members or
   support personnel on White House support mission aircraft, the WHMO will be advised and
   permission obtained through the unit C2 and CVAM. On de-positioning legs space available
   passengers will usually be permitted if the aircraft is no longer required to maintain an
   upgraded security status.
   13.7.4. Maximize seat availability on all missions. The maximum number of passengers
   may be limited by the aircrew complement, amount of AFE, operable seats with seat belts,
   baggage securing capabilities, aircraft configuration and latrine capacity vs. personnel
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                171


  loading (see Table 13.3), as well as a thorough assessment of ORM based on mission
  requirements. Passengers will be seated as far forward in the passenger compartment as
  possible. Seating aft of the aft escape hatch is prohibited. PIC is the final authority for seat
  release.
  13.7.5. Passenger Missions. A basic aircrew of two pilots and one boom operator may carry
  10 passengers maximum.          When departing home station, an additional crew member
  certified by SQ/CC in passenger handling must be assigned to the mission when more than
  10 passengers (Space A/MEP/Duty Pax) are planned to be carried on any leg. While off-
  station, a basic aircrew of two pilots and one boom operator with an additional person trained
  in KC-135 egress may carry 36 passengers (maximum of 40 souls on board). To carry more
  than 36 passengers requires a waiver IAW paragraph 1.4 and additional AFE equipment.
     13.7.5.1. Qualified maintenance personnel assigned to a mission may be used as
     designated egress facilitators while on the ground. Maintenance personnel will have
     egress training documented and will not perform other aircrew functions. Maintenance
     personnel will be briefed by the pilot or boom operator on assigned egress duties and will
     be seated at the aft hatch or as assigned by the boom operator to assist in the event of
     emergency ground egress. Maintenance personnel duty periods outlined in AFI 21-201
     apply. In addition, crew chiefs will be coded as MEP on the flight authorization.
     13.7.5.2. Passenger briefing requirements will remain the responsibility of the aircrew
     member. Additionally, the boom operator will continue to be responsible for passenger
     monitoring during the remainder of the flight.
  13.7.6. Manifesting. Passenger service or base operations personnel manifest passengers at
  locations with an AMC passenger processing activity. Sufficient copies of the passenger
  manifest must be given to the BO prior to passenger boarding. The PIC and BO are
  responsible for ensuring all passengers are properly manifested.
     13.7.6.1. For locations without AMC passenger processing capabilities, it may be
     necessary for crews to perform passenger service functions. These functions include
     manifesting, anti- hijacking processing, and ensuring visa/passport requirements are met.
     When the aircrew accomplishes manifesting, anti-hijack-processing is completed by the
     aircrew IAW AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) (FOUO).
     Do not hesitate to contact 618 AOC (TACC)/XOGX, Aerial Port Control Center
     (APCC); DSN 779-0350/0355, commercial; 618-229-0350/0355, if any questions arise
     such as who may travel to specific locations or pass- port/visa requirements. Aircraft
     operating within other MAJCOMs which have operational C2 over that aircraft will
     contact the appropriate AMOCC for specific details. File a copy of the DD Form 2131,
     Passenger Manifest, with the flight plan. If not filed with the flight plan, annotate the
     location of the manifest on the flight plan IAW AFI 11-202V3.
  13.7.7. The auxiliary power unit may be shut down prior to boarding passengers unless
  adequate ear protection is provided. A passenger service representative or crewmember will
  assist passengers at the bottom of the steps/stairs, and the BO will assist in seating
  passengers. DVs, passengers requiring assistance, and families should be boarded first to
  minimize separation. Make every effort to seat families together.
172                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


  13.7.8. Brief passengers using the passenger briefing checklist unless the passenger briefing
  video has been shown. Passenger monitors will brief all passengers on emergency exits upon
  arrival at the aircraft. The passenger video does not include required individual briefings for
  personnel seated next to emergency exit hatches or mission specific information. A crew
  member must brief these items separately.
      13.7.8.1. Demonstration of onboard aircrews life sustaining equipment is required for all
      missions carrying passengers. Ensure a demonstration kit is onboard prior to departure.
      The passenger safety briefing/life sustaining equipment demonstration may be inhibited
      by factors such as noise, short ground times, overcrowded cargo/passenger
      compartments, etc. These conditions will not be used as an excuse to fail to perform a
      proper and thorough briefing.
      13.7.8.2. Emphasize proper hand placement during activation of the EPOS. Proper hand
      placement is as follows; “During activation grasp the body of cylinder. Failure to do so
      will restrict the metal tab from opening and activating the oxygen system. The EPOS will
      not function without the removal of the metal tab. If the red knob separates, grasp the
      lanyard to pull the metal tab off the cylinder and then proceed to use the EPOS as
      directed. Failure to activate the flow of oxygen will reduce the level of oxygen inside the
      hood and result in suffocation and death.”
  13.7.9. Place one passenger information guide at each airline type seat and one for every 5
  seating positions in the case of side facing troop seats. Passenger information guides may be
  obtained electronically at https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/docs/publication_75.pdf from
  the AMC Stan/Eval Publications website. Order printed copies of the Air Force Visual Aid
  (AFVA) 11-226 at the Air Force Publications website http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.
  13.7.10. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor has
  the option to either hold the child or place him/her in a Department of Transportation-
  approved Infant Car Seat (ICS). Although the use of ICS for children processed through
  AMC-owned or controlled terminals (including gateways) is no longer mandatory, all
  passengers (duty and space- A), regardless of age, are required to be assigned their own seat.
  This policy will provide an infant and their sponsor with a dedicated seat allowing the use
  of an ICS at the sponsors discretion; this mirrors current FAA (commercial) standards.
  The FAA has banned the use of booster seats, harnesses, and vest child restraints.
      13.7.10.1. Passengers may hand-carry their ICS. If used, secure the ICS to the seat using
      the seat belt. Adults will not hold the ICS during any phase of flight. In the event of
      turbulence or emergency landing, it is highly recommended for infants to be secured in
      an ICS.
  13.7.11. Decisions regarding eligibility or acceptance of a passenger with disabilities for
  flight need to be determined at the lowest level possible. Problems concerning eligibility or
  acceptance that cannot be resolved locally must be reported (circumstances, chronology,
  names, units, etc.) to HQ AMC/A4T. For time sensitive problems, telephone HQ
  AMC/A4TP DSN 779-4592 or 618 AOC (TACC)/APCC.
  13.7.12. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight. In
  the case of SAAM or exercise missions at non-AMC locations, coordinate with C2 or the
  troop commander to decide if downloading of baggage is necessary.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 173


      13.7.13. RUSH baggage movement will be accomplished IAW AMCI 24-101 V15, Military
      Airlift—Baggage Service. The BO will ensure ATOC provides a copy of the AMC Form 70,
      RUSH Baggage Manifest, for the shipment of RUSH baggage.
      13.7.14. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet service and returned to
      the flight kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure that a copy of AF Form 3516, Food
      Service Inventory Transfer Receipt, is received from fleet service to relieve the BO of
      meal accountability.
      13.7.15. Pillow and Blanket Distribution. Hand out pillows and blankets only when
      requested by passengers. At enroute locations, leave used pillows and blankets on seats for
      thru-load passengers. Do not mix used and unused pillows and blankets.
      13.7.16. Passenger Loading With A/M 135 Cargo Loading Roller System Installed. Tables
      13.1 and 13.2 are planning factors for carrying space available passengers. Latrine capacity
      (Table 13.3) and egress capabilities should be taken into consideration.

       13.7.16.1. When securing removed roller trays, do not over-tighten cargo straps as this
       may cause warping. Prior to moving any pallet, pallet stops and roller tray assemblies
       must be reinstalled as required. Refer to T.O. 1C-135-9.
       13.7.16.2. Secure passenger baggage on top of any cargo pallet but do not exceed the 65-
       inch height limit. Do not wedge or secure baggage between pallets or between the
       aircraft fuselage and the adjacent RH side of pallets. If passenger baggage is not pre
       palletized, weights must be provided by passenger service or ATOC prior to loading.
       13.7.16.3. Duty passenger baggage requirements and the capability to safely stow all
       baggage and maintain aisle space to all emergency exits will be considered in overall
       planning for maximum seating arrangements when using the A/M 135 roller system for
       deployment/redeployment. Except for unit deployment/redeployment, use the following
       guidance for passenger seating requirements.
          13.7.16.3.1. Space-A passengers will be seated on the seat pallet in pallet position
          number one (if installed) or in LH and RH troop seats adjacent to empty pallet
          positions. They will not be seated in troop seats adjacent to cargo pallets. To
          enhance egress capability when carrying space-A passengers, troop seats adjacent to
          cargo pallets will be stowed, if practical.   The number of pallets carried will
          determine seat release.
          13.7.16.3.2. The seat pallet will be moved forward one detent (approximately 10
          inches) to provide required 30 inch spacing forward of netted or strapped cargo. A
          sufficient aisle to and from the cockpit must be maintained for egress. Other pallets
          may be repositioned, and pallet stops and center roller tray assemblies removed IAW
          1C-135-9 for passenger comfort and safety. Do not decrease number of passenger for
          this purpose.
13.8. Passenger Handling.
   13.8.1. A passenger service representative or crew member will assist passengers at the
   bottom of the steps, and the BO will assist in seating passengers. Make every effort to seat
   families together to minimize confusion during an emergency egress. DVs, passengers
   requiring assistance and families should be boarded first. The BO is key to good passenger
   relations. The following rules should be observed:
       13.8.1.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
       13.8.1.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics
       and/or criticism of other personnel or organizations.
       13.8.1.3. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal
       interest and willingness to help.
   13.8.2. Comments by all crewmembers and crew chiefs and the manner in which they are
   made often determine passenger attitudes about the flight.         Always remember that
   passengers are individuals; address them collectively only when making announcements.
   13.8.3. In-flight Procedures
       13.8.3.1. The BO or passenger monitor will brief all passengers to remain seated with
       their seat belts fastened during air refueling. This briefing will be conducted, as a
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                175


     minimum, in-flight just prior to the BO moving to the boom pod. Except during air
     refueling, passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however,
     judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any
     one time. Seated passengers will have seat belts fastened at all times. Discourage
     passengers from congregating around galley, lavatory and crew bunk areas. Passengers
     will not lounge or sleep under or on top of cargo, baggage bins, or baggage secured to the
     floor.
     13.8.3.2. Make frequent checks on cabin temperature, passengers with small
     children and cleanliness of the cabin and lavatory.
     13.8.3.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with cargo or emergency equipment.
     Passengers will not be permitted access to checked baggage.
     13.8.3.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means to
     make passengers comfortable such as dimming or extinguishing unnecessary
     compartment lights.
     13.8.3.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck or boom pod only when approved by the
     PIC. Use good judgment when requesting this authority. Reference paragraph 5.3 for
     further guidance.
  13.8.4. Meal Service. The AMC form 148, Boarding/Pass Ticket, indicates if a meal was
  ordered by a passenger.
     13.8.4.1. Meals are served at normal hours when practical, based on the local time at
     point of departure. Avoid waking passengers to offer meals. Ask the PIC about expected
     flight conditions prior to serving meals. For passengers who ordered a meal, serve
     meals in the following sequence:
        13.8.4.1.1. Small children requiring assistance.
        13.8.4.1.2. Distinguished Visitors (DV).
        13.8.4.1.3. All other passengers.
     13.8.4.2. Box Lunches. After takeoff, distribute box lunches to passengers who boarded
     at the previous station. This lessens confusion when flight segments are short and more
     passengers board at subsequent stations.
     13.8.4.3. Do not serve liquids or hot food during turbulence.
     13.8.4.4. Turn in all meals unfit for consumption to the first in-flight kitchen. If in radio
     contact with the issuing station, relay aircraft tail number, mission identifier, numbered of
     spoiled meals (by menu) and issuing organization.
     13.8.4.5. When prepared meals have not been furnished to passengers, annotate the
     individual’s boarding pass to reflect reimbursement is authorized. Inform passengers they
     may receive refunds at the next station or the originating or destination terminal.
        13.8.4.5.1. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet and returned
        to the in- flight kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure that a copy of AF Form
        129, Tally In-Out, is received from fleet to relieve the BO of meal accountability.
 176                                                   AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


       13.8.4.6. Complimentary snacks and beverages are authorized on Transportation
       Working Capital Fund (TWCF) funded missions (including ANG and AFRC flown
       missions) for passenger consumption only. Complimentary snacks are not authorized on
       JA/ATT, Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) exercises, or SAAM missions. The squadron or port
       operations officer will ensure snacks and beverages are placed on board when departing
       AMC stations. When departing from other stations and no snacks or beverages are
       placed onboard, the BO may obtain required snacks and beverages from the local in-
       flight kitchen.
13.9. Passenger Restrictions.
   13.9.1. The total number of personnel aboard -135 aircraft must not, under any normal
   condition, exceed the number of serviceable seats, with seat belts installed and available
   AFE. Personnel will not be seated aft of the aft emergency escape hatch. The PIC is the
   final arbiter as to how many space-A passengers can be safely transported.
   13.9.2. No-show passenger baggage or baggage of passengers removed from the flight will
   be downloaded prior to departure. See exception in paragraph 13.7.13
   13.9.3. Latrine Capacity vs. Personnel Loading. PICs will consider the limited capacity of
   latrine facilities when carrying passengers. Waiver authority to exceed maximum latrine
   capacity during deployment operations rests with the OG/CC. For all other missions, use
   Table 13.3 to calculate the total latrine capacity (in gallons) required against the maximum
   number of personnel and the sortie duration. Add additional devices or download passengers
   as required to meet mission requirements. The loss of capacity from unusable devices (e.g.
   inoperative commode, missing urinal, etc.) must be considered before calculating personnel
   accommodations. Aircraft modified with the 36 gallon capacity latrine (TCTO 1C-135-
   1596) need not compute maximum personnel loading against Table 13.3. If TCTO 1C-135-
   1596 is installed the maximum capacity is 60 people for 12 hours.
       13.9.3.1. Standard aircraft configuration with one latrine commode and two urinals
       provides approximately 16 gallons of total capacity. This may be reduced by up to 1.5
       gallons depending on the total amount of chemically treated water (pre charge) placed in
       each device. Extra devices (urinals, commode cartridges) may be added to accommodate
       larger passenger loads/increased sortie durations provided they can be safely stored,
       swapped and/or used inflight. Calculate .5 gal. pre-charge for each added device. Plan
       configuration requirements prior to home station departure.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                            177


Table 13.3. Latrine Capacity vs Personnel Loading Chart.




13.10. En route and Post Flight Duties.
   13.10.1. At stations where a crew change is made and loading or offloading is required, the
   inbound BO is responsible for offloading the aircraft. The outbound BO is responsible for
   planning and loading the outbound load.
   13.10.2. At stops where the primary BO is relieved of cargo unloading, provide relief
   personnel information regarding passenger and aircraft equipment, any missing items, the
   location of through cargo (including hazardous cargo information), mail and baggage, and
   any information pertinent to through passengers.
   13.10.3. Assist passengers to deplane. If BLUE BARKS, DVs, COIN ASSIST, or couriers
   are aboard, the BO will inform the protocol or traffic representative respectively.
13.11. Loaded Weapons. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in
the weapon. This applies even though the clip or magazine is empty.
 178                                                  AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   13.11.1. Personnel who will engage an enemy force immediately on arrival (actual combat)
   may carry basic combat loads on their person. Weapons will remain clear with magazines or
   clips removed until immediately prior to exiting the aircraft. The troop commander will
   coordinate with the BO or passenger monitor prior to directing personnel to load any
   weapons.
   13.11.2. Personnel who will not immediately engage an enemy force will store basic
   ammunition loads in a centralized location for redistribution on arrival at the objective.
   Magazines or clips will not be inserted into weapons.
13.12. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance according to T.O. 1C-135-5-1,
Basic Weight Check List, Maintenance Data, Loading Data, and Fuel Loading Data, and
Addenda A of this AFI, C/KC-135 Aircraft Configuration. The unit possessing the airplane
maintains the primary weight and balance handbook containing the current airplane status and
provides a supplemental weight and balance handbook for each airplane.          Enclose the
supplemental handbook in a wear-resistant binder labeled "Weight and Balance" with the
airplane model and complete serial number on the cover or spine.
   13.12.1. The pilot will file the original DD FORM 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance
   Form F – Transport/Tactical (or approved substitute form) at the departure airfield and
   maintain a physical or electronic copy for the duration of the flight.
13.13. Cargo Validation On/Offloading Procedures and Format. Use the following format
when tasked to validate a new loading procedure or when encountering any cargo requiring
special or specific on/offloading or tiedown procedures not currently listed in T.O. 1C-135-9.
After completion, send through standardization channels to HQ AMC/A3V.
   13.13.1. General Loading Data:
       13.13.1.1. Nomenclature of item. Give military or civilian name, national stock number
       (NSN), and a brief description of the item.
       13.13.1.2. Dimensions (in inches). Length, width, and height. Rough drawing or picture
       of the unit, pointing out critical dimensions, projections, overhangs, etc. Include a
       website address of the manufacturer, if available.
       13.13.1.3. Weight (in pounds).     Gross weight; individual axle weight; or data plate
       weight if possible.
   13.13.2. Number of loading crew personnel and BOs required to on/offload cargo and their
   position to observe clearances, if required.
   13.13.3. Equipment and Material Requirements. Special equipment and material required
   to on/offload cargo, (i.e., jacks, pry bars, shoring requirements etc.).
   13.13.4. Aircraft Configuration Required.
   13.13.5. Preparation of Cargo for Loading. Components that must be removed or
   reconfigured to on/offload cargo, (i.e., exhaust stacks, etc.).
   13.13.6. On/off Loading Procedures.
   13.13.7. Location of Tiedown Points.
   13.13.8. Comments.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  179


13.14. Rucksacks. The following procedures apply to loading rucksacks.
   13.14.1. In all cases, load rucksacks on the same aircraft as the individual.
   13.14.2. Rucksacks will not normally fit under seats without obstructing the aisle way,
   therefore during administrative deployments they must be palletized or loaded in baggage
   bins.
   13.14.3. During tactical deployments, rucksacks not loaded on vehicles will be carried by the
   individual onto the aircraft. Allocate pallet space on the load plan for loading rucksacks.
   13.14.4. Ensure all rucksacks are properly secured and their weight is accounted for on DD
   Form 365-4 and all load computations.
   13.14.5. The following procedures apply to transporting hazardous materials in rucksacks.
       13.14.5.1. Personnel will only be permitted to carry their basic combat load or individual
       issue of hazardous material when they will engage an enemy force immediately upon
       arrival. Personnel may retain small arms ammunition (cartridge for weapons, DOT 1.4)
       and nuclear, biological, and chemical equipment as long as it is retained in a carrier (i.e.,
       bandoleers, pouches, bags).
       13.14.5.2. Munitions and other hazardous materials placed in rucksacks, field packs, or
       other authorized containers, removed from their shipping container, must be adequately
       protected from accidental functioning. All carriers will be consolidated in one central
       location on the aircraft (as directed by the boom operator) and distributed to personnel
       after landing. Ensure compliance with AFMAN 24-204.
13.15. Human Remains. Transport human remains on KC-135 aircraft IAW AMCI 24-101
Vol 11 and AMCI 11-208 guidance.
13.16. Blood and Body Fluid Cleanup.
   13.16.1. There may be times when the aircraft requires clean-up of blood or other body
   fluids during and/or following mission execution. This clean-up is designed to alleviate
   legitimate health concerns. Blood and body fluids such as vomit and feces may contain
   disease-causing organisms which can pose a health threat to crewmembers and passengers.
   To ensure the health of personnel traveling aboard the aircraft and minimize any risk to
   mission accomplishment, spills must be prevented and/or cleaned properly by aircraft
   crewmembers or ground personnel. As in- flight duties permit, aircrew members need to
   address these spills. Medical crew or critical care air transport team members will continue
   to be responsible for cleaning and disinfection of patient-related spills.
   13.16.2. When transporting human remains, the possibility of body fluid spills is
   minimal. Condensation may occur on transfer cases due to ice inside the container. If there
   appears to be fluid other than condensation, it needs to be cleaned as follows:
       13.16.2.1. If possible, put a barrier (plastic, paper towels, rags) down to minimize
       aircraft contamination. Dispose of these items IAW paragraph 13.16.2.2 The
       recommended method to clean and disinfect the area in-flight is to use the AMC SG/A44-
       approved blood and body fluid clean up kit to ensure proper personal protection and to
       prevent the spread of disease.
180                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


      13.16.2.2. Personnel cleaning the spill will wear the appropriate personal protective
      equipment included in the clean-up kit. Personnel will not use the PCK for blood and
      body fluid clean up. The PCK contains items for use by aircrew during emergencies
      aboard aircraft carrying hazardous cargo IAW AFMAN 24-204. At no time will
      contaminated items be placed in the PCK. The in- flight ventilation system is sufficient
      to eliminate vapors when the pre-moistened towels are used. If decontaminated in-flight,
      no further action is necessary. Place an entry into the AFTO Form 781A to ensure the kit
      is replaced. Any disposable items used and any potentially contaminated trash must
      either be placed in red-biohazard bags located in the clean-up kit or in double-thickness
      bags. These bags must be clearly marked as containing bio-hazards. Wash hands or use
      the hand sanitizer in the spill kit after cleaning the spill. Contact the nearest military
      medical treatment facility thru the local command post to arrange disposal of
      contaminated materials.
      13.16.2.3. If a clean-up kit is not available and an alternative means of containing the
      leaking bodily fluids exists, clean the spill by applying paper towels or rags to absorb the
      fluid, then wipe the area with approved aircraft cleaners or water, then wipe dry. The
      area still requires decontamination upon landing. Clearly mark the area and, upon
      landing, contact the local C2 to request assistance and/or equipment required to properly
      clean the spill.
  13.16.3. Any necessary post-flight disinfection will be in accordance with the weapons
  system- specific tech data and/or T.O. 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapons System Cleaning and
  Corrosion Control. Failure to comply may result in degradation of the aircraft structure. If
  required, senior operations and maintenance personnel will decide what additional measures
  need to be taken to minimize exposure risk.
      13.16.3.1. Absorbent materials such as fabric seats may resist disinfection; you should
      dispose of these materials IAW paragraph 13.16.2.2 Use water and chlorine bleach to
      disinfect aircraft items such as nylon seats and cargo straps.
      13.16.3.2. The squadron medical technician can order the blood and body fluid clean up
      kit through their host medical logistics account. The National Stock Number is 6515-01-
      524-9755. Ensure two kits are onboard the aircraft. Units deploying to an AOR should
      deploy with additional kits.

                        FUEL PLANNING AND CONSERVATION

14.1. General. This chapter is designed to assist pilots and planners in fuel planning for KC-
135 missions. The CFPS Computer Flight Plan (CFP) and TO 1C-KC-135-1-1, Performance
Manual are the primary preflight references. The planning procedures in this chapter apply to all
AMC- tasked and 618 AOC (TACC)-flight managed missions, in addition to local missions.
Missions should be planned at altitudes, routes, and airspeeds to minimize fuel usage.
14.2. Fuel Conservation. It is Air Force policy to conserve aviation fuel when it does not
adversely affect training, flight safety, or operational readiness. Aircrew and mission planners
will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will
be considered throughout all phases of mission planning and execution. Comply with the
following whenever consistent with tech order guidance and safety:
   14.2.1. Fuel Loads. Authorized Fuel Loads and Sequences. Aircraft will be loaded with fuel
   according to requirements of T.O. 1C-135-5-3, Fuel Loading Data. The OG/CC or
   equivalent will issue waiver approval. Non-AMC units may develop standard alternate fuel
   requirements for local training missions; however, these fuel requirements will not be less
   than those specified in this volume. Tankering fuel for convenience is prohibited. FM-
   planned tankered fuel is deemed operationally necessary, and will be included in the required
   ramp fuel load (RRFL). Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross weight and
   increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe
   mission accomplishment and training objectives.
   14.2.2. Flight Planning. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize flight plans and flight
   routing for fuel efficiency.
   14.2.3. APU Usage. Minimize the APU usage to the maximum extent possible. Early
   coordination may be required to ensure external power carts and heating/cooling units are
   available.
   14.2.4. Center-of-Gravity (CG). Load and maintain aircraft at an aft CG whenever possible
   consistent with mission requirements and Flight Manual restrictions.
   14.2.5. Engine Start. Delay engine start on all departures whenever practical to minimize
   fuel consumption.
   14.2.6. Taxi. Consider engine out taxi when permitted by the Flight Manual.
   14.2.7. Departure Planning. Consider use of opposite direction runway to reduce taxi and/or
   expedite departure routing if winds allow.
   14.2.8. Takeoff. Consider a rolling takeoff as well as reduced power when able. This saves
   fuel and engine wear. Clean up on schedule and don’t delay gear and flap retraction.
   14.2.9. Climb/Descent. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent profiles and power
   settings should also be considered for efficient fuel usage.
   14.2.10. Weather Deviations. Attempt to coordinate for off-course deviation early so gross
   maneuvering is not required.
 182                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   14.2.11. Cruise techniques. Attempt to trim the aircraft and match throttle settings whenever
   possible. Fly fuel efficient speeds and altitudes to the maximum extent possible.
       14.2.11.1. When time between air refueling exceeds 10 minutes, the boom/hose will be
       stowed.
   14.2.12. Approach. Fly most direct routing to arrival approach consistent with mission
   requirements. Delay initial configuration as much as practical after considering approach
   complexity, weather, pilot proficiency, etc.
   14.2.13. Holding. If holding is required, hold clean at the most fuel efficient altitude and
   request a large holding pattern. Hold at endurance or performance manual recommended
   holding speeds, conditions permitting.
   14.2.14. Parking. Consider using shortest taxi route and avoid double blocking when able.
14.3. Fuel Planning Procedures. Aircrew should employ the following aviation fuel
optimization measures without compromising flight safety or jeopardizing mission/training
accomplishment:
   14.3.1. Plan a 45-minute fuel reserve at destination or alternate (when an alternate is
   required).
   14.3.2. Plan fuel to an alternate only when AFI 11-202V3 or AFI 11-2KC-135V3 require the
   filing of an alternate.
       14.3.2.1. When only one alternate is required, use the closest suitable airfield meeting
       mission requirements (such as special requirements for hazmat or patients) and AFI 11-
       202V3 weather criteria.
       14.3.2.2. If two alternates are required, use the two closest suitable airfields meeting AFI
       11-202V3 weather criteria and fuel plan to the more distant of the two.
       14.3.2.3. When selecting an alternate, suitable military airfields are preferred if within 75
       nautical miles of destination. (The ACFP default distance to an alternate is 75 nautical
       miles. Consequently, where the alternate is less than 75 nautical miles from the primary
       destination, ACFP will assume that the airfield is 75 nautical miles away.)
       14.3.2.4. The practice of selecting an alternate in another weather system or selecting an
       alternate based on maintenance capability will not be used.
       14.3.2.5. ACFP will provide a route of flight to the primary alternate if greater than 75
       miles from the destination.
       14.3.2.6. For remote destinations, holding is authorized in lieu of an alternate airport. In
       such situations, use 2+00 hrs reserve fuel (1+15 holding in lieu of an alternate and 0+45
       reserve).
   14.3.3. For all missions other than local training missions, calculate 15 minutes of
   contingency fuel using destination gross weights. Local training missions are not required to
   carry contingency fuel. If contingency fuel is carried on local training missions, it should not
   exceed 15 minutes. Contingency fuel is not considered reserve fuel since it can be consumed
   at any point during the mission. Contingency fuel will be included in the initial RRFL
   calculation.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                183


      14.3.3.1. AMC’s ACFP will calculate reserves and contingency fuel as holding fuel.
      Computer flight plans will have 1+00 holding when combining 0+45 reserve and 0+15
      contingency fuel (for remote destinations ACFP will plan 2+15 holding, combining 2+00
      reserve and 15 minutes contingency fuel).
      14.3.3.2. Reserve and contingency fuel will be computed using consumption rates
      providing maximum endurance at 10,000 feet MSL at destination gross weight. If an
      alternate is required, compute using weight at alternate destination. When computing
      reserve and contingency fuel for remote destinations, use consumption rates providing
      maximum endurance at 20,000 feet MSL.
   14.3.4. Using all available planning tools (including ACFP and CFP) and guidance in this
   chapter, PICs will determine the RRFL. When actual fuel load exceeds the RRFL by more
   than 5,000 lbs, defuel the aircraft to the RRFL.
      14.3.4.1. Identified extra fuel may be added to RRFL:
          14.3.4.1.1. When fuel availability is limited or not available at en route stops.
          14.3.4.1.2. For known holding delays in excess of standard.
          14.3.4.1.3. For anticipated off course weather avoidance.
          14.3.4.1.4. When reliable wind data or receiver profiles are not available.
      14.3.4.2. Airlift missions. Plan Long Range Cruise (LRC) and optimum altitude.
      14.3.4.3. Tanker Mission. Plan to and from the AAR track or anchor at LRC and
      optimum altitude.
   14.3.5. When an Aircraft Commander believes the fuel load is insufficient to execute the
   mission, contact will be made with the FM to identify and resolve the differences. When the
   aircraft commander and FM do not reach an agreement, the aircraft commander is the final
   authority for adding additional fuel. The FM will add a comment to the crew papers
   indicating the final fuel load, “as determined by the AC”.
   14.3.6. Tankering fuel for convenience is prohibited. MAJCOM C2 or 618 AOC (TACC)-
   sanctioned tankered fuel is deemed operationally necessary, and will be included in the
   RRFL.
   14.3.7. When there is a conflict between an on-time departure and defueling, the 618 AOC
   (TACC), deputy director of operations (DDO) or MAJCOM C2 equivalent will determine
   which takes precedence. The OG/CC will make this determination when serving as mission
   execution authority.
14.4. Fuel Requirements. This section augments AFI 11-202V3 fuel requirements.
   14.4.1. Required Ramp Fuel. Will consist of all fuel required for mission accomplishment, to
   include fuel required for engine start, taxi, APU operation, takeoff, enroute, enroute reserve,
   air refueling, depressurization, descent, approach and landing, alternate, transition, and
   holding/minimum landing. Zero fuel baseline is 4,400 lbs (2,000 lbs in the forward body tank
   for ballast and 600 lbs in each of the main tanks). This zero fuel baseline, plus reserve fuel,
   contingency fuel and any other identified alternate and/or required fuel will be used to
   calculate planned final landing fuel. When Actual Fuel Load (AFL) exceeds the RRFL by
184                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


  more than 5,000 lbs, defuel the aircraft to the RRFL. When there is a conflict between an on
  time departure and defueling, the MAJCOM C2 with mission execution authority will
  determine which takes precedence (OG/CC for local training sorties).
  14.4.2. Start Engines, Taxi, APU operation, and Takeoff. A standard planning factor of 2500
  lbs of fuel is typically used. Fuel planning may be adversely affected by considerable taxi
  operations or ATC delays.
  14.4.3. Not Used.
  14.4.4. En route Fuel. Fuel from Start of Climb segment at the departure location to Begin
  Descent Point at destination.
  14.4.5. Category 1 Reserves. Not authorized.
  14.4.6. Air Refueling Fuel. Scheduled offload.
      14.4.6.1. KC-135 R/T receiver aircraft. Scheduled offload minus scheduled onload. If
      scheduled onloads are not completed it may be impossible to complete the mission.
  14.4.7. Extra Fuel. The difference between the flight planned fuel and the fuel on board the
  plane will not exceed 5,000 pounds. The extra fuel may be added to RRFL: when fuel
  availability is limited or not available at en route stops, for known holding delays in excess of
  standard, for anticipated off course weather avoidance, when reliable wind data or receiver
  profiles are not available.
      14.4.7.1. Not Used.
      14.4.7.2. Use 2,500 pounds if forecasted thunderstorms are scattered or numerous along
      the route of flight, 1,300 pounds if forecast thunderstorms are few along the route of
      flight, and 700 pounds if forecast thunderstorms are isolated along the route of flight.
      Thunderstorm forecasts will be based on the DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing or
      equivalent.
      14.4.7.3. 618 AOC (TACC) and local missions add 15 minutes (3,000 lbs) of East coast
      hold down fuel for departures from Andrews, Dover, Martinsburg, McGuire, Stewart, and
      Westover. NOTE: Hold down fuel is added as a departure bias and will be burned at the
      top of climb. For Flight Managed missions, hold down fuel will be annotated on the
      ACFP as “Fuel D” at the beginning of the ACFP and accounted for in the top of climb
      fuel block on the ACFP.
      14.4.7.4. 618 AOC (TACC) and local missions add 15 Minutes (3,000 lbs) of early
      descent fuel for Andrews, Dover, Martinsburg, McGuire, Stewart, and Westover arrivals.
      NOTE: Early descent fuel is added as an arrival bias and will be burned on the last leg.
      For Flight Managed missions, early descent fuel will be annotated on the ACFP as “Fuel
      A” at the beginning of the ACFP and accounted for in the last leg fuel block on the
      ACFP.
      14.4.7.5. Transition. Fuel for transition training at the destination. Compute at 7.5% of
      airplane gross weight per hour. This includes fuel for the initial approach.
  14.4.8. Depressurization Fuel. During all flight portions, crews will plan to exercise
  depressurization procedures in accordance with T.O.s and AFI11-202V3, paragraphs 6.4.1
  and 6.4.3. Crews will verify ACFP calculated fuel required to a recovery airfield in the event
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 185


   of depressurization at the ETP, to determine if additional fuel must be added. Crews will
   manually calculate ETP/decompression fuel required if ACFP in unavailable. Reference
   14.4.8.3.1 for ETP Calculations.
       14.4.8.1. The ACFP calculates decompression fuel from the ETP at 10,000’ altitude. If
       additional fuel is required from the ETP, the ACFP automatically adds it to Block 10 of
       the ACFP. Plan to arrive at the recovery airfield with 0+30 minutes reserve fuel at
       optimal cruise speed for the depressurization transit altitude. Depressurization fuel is not
       cumulative with enroute reserve fuel or contingency fuel. Forecast weather conditions for
       the recovery airfields (ETA +/- 1 Hour) will meet or exceed minimums for the lowest
       compatible approach or 500/1 whichever is greater.
       14.4.8.2. Where weather conditions dictate, add only one of the following fuel
       corrections. Thunderstorm corrections are not cumulative. Use the highest applicable
       correction for the forecast conditions.
          14.4.8.2.1. Flight managers will include 4 minutes (700 lbs) of fuel if forecast
          thunderstorms are isolated along the route of flight.
          14.4.8.2.2. Flight managers will include 8 minutes (1300 lbs) of fuel if forecast
          thunderstorms are few along the route of flight.
          14.4.8.2.3. Flight managers will include 15 minutes (2500 lbs) of fuel if forecast
          thunderstorms are scattered or numerous along the route of flight.
       14.4.8.3. Equal Time Point (ETP). First Suitable Airfield (FSAF) and Last Suitable
       Airfield (LSAF) are used in the ETP calculation. These are represented as the First
       Nearest and the Last Nearest airports in the ETP calculation. They are airports closest to
       the coast out and coast in waypoints that meet applicable destination alternate
       requirements except weather. Forecast weather conditions for LSAF/FSAF (ETA from
       the ETP/DF +/- 1 Hour) will meet or exceed minimums for the lowest compatible
       approach or 500/1, whichever is greater. ACFP plans to arrive overhead at the recovery
       location with 0+30 minutes reserve fuel. Additional fuel (e.g. descent, approach, and
       landing) may be required, based on mission requirements.
          14.4.8.3.1. ETP Calculation. ETP calculations are required on portions of routes
          when the total time between the LSAF and the FSAF is 3-hours or more. This hour
          requirement was derived from the minimum flight time on a trans-Atlantic flight.
          LSAF and FSAF selected for ETPs calculated in ACFP are authorized for use in-
          flight. Plan to land at the recovery location with 0+30 minutes reserve fuel. ACFP
          selects ETP as the point on the route of flight where the time to travel to either the
          LSAF or FSAF is equivalent, within a 3-minute tolerance. ACFP ETP calculations
          use wind data, great circle distances, and cruise and descent times from the ETP to
          LSAF and ETP to FSAF.
Crews can use the following formula to verify ACFP ETP calculations:
       TIME in hours (ETP-FSAF)=DISTANCE (LSAF to FSAF) (WF2 –WF1) + 2(TAS)
Wind Factor (WF) is a positive tailwind component or a negative headwind component computed
between suitable airfields. The WF is computed by comparing average ground speed (GS) to the
true airspeed (TAS).
 186                                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


WF1 is the wind factor for the first half of the route. WF2 is the wind factor for the second half of
the route.
           14.4.8.3.2. If the LSAF/FSAF is not on the flight plan course, ACFP will use a point
           90 deg perpendicular from the LSAF and/or FSAF to the flight plan course to
           determine the total distance between LSAF and FSAF. NOTE: The closer the LSAF
           and FSAF are to the flight plan course the more accurate the ETP solution provided
           by ACFP.
   14.4.9. Descent, Approach and Landing. Plan an enroute descent whenever possible.
   14.4.10. Alternate. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3,
   General Flight Rules. When selecting an alternate, suitable military airfields are preferred if
   within 75 nautical miles of destination. Plan a 45 minute fuel reserve at the alternate. NOTE:
   The practice of selecting an alternate in another weather system or selecting an alternate
   based on maintenance capability will no longer be used.
       14.4.10.1. Plan fuel to an alternate only when AFI 11-202V3 requires an alternate to be
       filed. Refer to section 6.18, this instruction, for further guidance on selection of
       alternates. If two alternates are required, fuel plan to the more distant of the two meeting
       AFI 11-202V3 weather criteria.
   14.4.11. Reserve Fuel.
       14.4.11.1. Holding (Fuel Reserves). Plan a 45-minute fuel reserve at the destination or
       alternate (if an alternate is required). Plan an additional 15 minutes of contingency fuel
       using destination gross weights for any unforeseen circumstances (N/A for local training
       missions). When filing an alternate located in Alaska or at latitudes greater than 59
       degrees (North or South) do not add additional holding fuel.
       14.4.11.2. Remote destination. If weather conditions require an alternate airfield in
       accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, aircrews may use 2+00 hours of holding fuel in
       lieu of an alternate (1+15 holding in lieu of and 0+45 reserve). A remote or island
       destination is defined as any aerodrome which, due to its unique geographic location,
       offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time.
       14.4.11.3. Not Used.
       14.4.11.4. Not Used.
   14.4.12. Minimum Planned Fuel at Begin Descent Point. Consists of fuel required for
   descent, approach and landing, alternate/missed approach, and holding/minimum landing
   fuel. Units may develop standard alternate fuel requirements for local training missions
   however; these fuel requirements will not be less than those specified in this AFI. Unit local
   supplements will not dictate “IAF” or “Top of Descent Fuel”.
14.5. When an Aircraft Commander believes the fuel load is insufficient to execute the
mission contact will be made with the FM to identify and resolve the differences. When the
aircraft commander and FM do not reach an agreement, the aircraft commander is the final
authority for adding additional fuel. The FM will add a comment to the crew papers indicating
the final fuel load, as determined by the AC.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                    187


                                            Chapter 15

                                       AIR REFUELING

15.1. General. This chapter establishes air refueling guidelines applicable to KC-135 aircraft
and aircrews and is supplemental to those prescribed by the flight manual and other applicable
directives.
15.2. AAR Limitations. The following limitations apply:
   15.2.1. AR altitudes. AAR operations will be conducted above 12,000 feet MSL, or 10,000
   feet AGL, whichever is higher. Comply with Low Altitude Operations
   procedures/restrictions in aircraft Technical Order (Section V). EXCEPTION: C-130 and A-
   10 receivers may be refueled as low as 5,000 feet AGL, if mission requirements dictate.
       15.2.1.1. AAR operations based at or above 12,000 feet MSL, which momentarily fall
       below 10,000 feet AGL, but no lower than 5,000 feet AGL, due to over flight of
       mountain ridges, peaks, etc., are permissible.
       15.2.1.2. If refueling must be accomplished below 10,000 feet AGL, limit refueling time
       to the minimum required to meet operational requirements and then immediately recover
       to normal refueling altitudes. Crews must ensure thorough knowledge of terrain features
       when operating below 10,000 feet AGL and will limit operations to flat or rolling terrain,
       or over water.
       15.2.1.3. Pilots will fly no lower than an altitude that provides at least 5,000 ft. of
       clearance above the highest obstruction or terrain within 5 nautical miles either side of
       the planned course centerline.
   15.2.2. Refueling During Missions. AAR should not be accomplished during missions
   under the following conditions unless operational necessity dictates.
       15.2.2.1. Conditions result in marginal control of either aircraft or boom (in the opinion
       of either the PIC or BO).
       15.2.2.2. Either tanker or receiver (except B-52) has less than the full number of engines
       operating.
       15.2.2.3. Tanker aircraft is unable to retract the landing gear.
       15.2.2.4. Pod Control Panel malfunction exists that cannot be resolved.
       15.2.2.5. MPRS pod malfunction. If Pod Control Panel is operational and only one pod is
       malfunctioning, AAR is permissible with operational pod.
   15.2.3. Tanker Autopilot. Tanker pilots will ensure the boom operator notifies receiver pilots
   when any axis of the autopilot is not used. If a tanker pilot or receiver pilot is required to fly
   autopilot-off for qualification training, the pilot flying the opposing aircraft will be qualified.
   Verbal notification and acknowledgement will take place between the tanker and receiver
   prior to conducting autopilot-off training. NOTE: This restriction does not apply during
   FTU training provided the student receiver pilot and the student tanker pilot are under direct
   IP supervision.
188                                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


  15.2.4. AAR Without Tanker Disconnect Capability. Without tanker disconnect capability
  means the BO cannot trigger an immediate disconnect. After a known loss of tanker
  disconnect capability with a particular receiver, do not attempt further contacts with that
  receiver. If the tanker signal system (signal coil) checks good, contact attempts with other
  receivers are permitted. If an immediate disconnect cannot be triggered on two successive
  receiver systems, no further contacts will be attempted. Receiver pilots may attempt a contact
  with another tanker; however, after two successive failures to disconnect from multiple
  tankers, no further contacts will be attempted with that receiver. EXCEPTION: Fuel
  emergency situations, OPLAN 8010 missions, contingency missions, JCS alert, receiver over
  water deployment or re-deployment, operational reconnaissance missions, prime nuclear
  airlift force (PNAF) support missions under normal conditions when the refueling is essential
  for home base recovery, or when authorized in the mission directive. NOTE: When
  conducting AAR without tanker disconnect capability, limit contacts to the minimum number
  necessary to complete mission requirements. Do not accomplish boom limit demonstrations,
  or practice emergency separations while in contact.
  15.2.5. Manual Boom Latching (MBL) [also referred to as Emergency Boom Latching
  (EBL) or Receiver Override Operation]. Normal tanker disconnect capability and automatic
  disconnect limits are inoperative. Training and evaluation in MBL procedures may only be
  accomplished under the following conditions:
      15.2.5.1. Direct IP supervision on board receiver aircraft (if other than fighter type).
      15.2.5.2. Limit contacts to minimum required.
      15.2.5.3. Receiver and tanker AAR systems must be fully operable and a demonstrated
      receiver pilot initiated disconnect capability must exist.
      15.2.5.4. Do not accomplish boom limit demonstrations, or practice emergency
      separations. NOTE: The BO and receiver pilot must coordinate all actions required by
      applicable directives and checklists when making AAR contacts during the situations
      listed above.
  15.2.6. Reverse AAR will be accomplished only in an emergency or for operational
  necessity, or IAW FTU syllabus training.
  15.2.7. Practice Emergency Separations.
      15.2.7.1. Prior to actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation,
      coordination between the tanker pilot, BO, and receiver pilot is mandatory. Coordination
      must include information on when the separation will occur and who will give the
      command of execution. Tanker pilot coordination may be accomplished over interphone
      with the BO.
      15.2.7.2. A practice emergency separation will not be called during the first contact
      event with each receiver i.e. contact and boom operator initiated disconnect. If separation
      is initiated from contact, the receiver’s AAR system must be in normal, and tanker
      disconnect capability must be verified by a boom operator initiated disconnect on the first
      contact event.
      15.2.7.3. May be accomplished with passengers on board. Ensure all passengers are
      seated with seat belts fastened.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                   189


   15.2.8. Limits Demonstration. KC-135 tanker disconnect capability must be verified by a
   BO initiated disconnect prior to receivers conducting limits demonstrations.
   15.2.9. Receiver AAR Training for Unqualified Receiver Pilots. The following procedures
   apply:
       15.2.9.1. The receiver pilot must inform the tanker crew of training status, and receive
       acknowledgment from the tanker BO.
       15.2.9.2. If unsupervised by an instructor boom operator, the BO operating the boom
       controls must be current and qualified for the applicable category receiver. Instructor
       boom operators supervising AAR must have immediate access to the ruddevator control
       stick, and have immediate communication capability with receiver pilot.
   15.2.10. Boom Operator Qualification or Training. Unqualified and non-current boom
   operators must be under direct instructor supervision to conduct AAR operations. Instructor
   boom operators supervising AAR must have immediate access to the ruddevator control
   stick, and have immediate communication capability with receiver pilot.
       15.2.10.1. If the boom operator is not certified for the applicable category of receiver, the
       tanker pilot must confirm that the receiver pilot flying is not currently undergoing
       initial/re-currency training in air refueling. NOTE: This restriction does not apply during
       FTU training provided the student BO is under direct instructor supervision.
   15.2.11. Operator Fatigue. If BO or receiver pilot fatigue becomes a factor during AAR
   operations, the receiver will maintain well clear until fatigue is no longer a factor (operator
   judgment).
   15.2.12. Weather limitations:
       15.2.12.1. Terminate refueling if moderate turbulence is encountered.
       15.2.12.2. Discontinue refueling if in-flight visibility is insufficient to continue safe
       refueling operations.
15.3. Communications Failure. Aircraft experiencing two-way communications failure during
the conduct of AAR shall discontinue AAR and continue flight in accordance with the following
procedures:
   15.3.1. Squawk code 7600 for at least 2 minutes prior to exiting the track or anchor.
   15.3.2. Receiver aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point
   shall exit the track or anchor at the lowest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling
   portion of the of the flight and proceed in accordance with "Procedures for Two Way Radio
   Failure IFR- VFR" as set forth in DoD Flight Information Handbook.
   15.3.3. Tanker aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point shall
   exit the track or anchor at the highest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling
   portion of the flight and proceed in accordance with "Procedures for Two Way Radio Failure
   IFR-VFR" set forth in DoD Flight Information Handbook.
15.4. Operational Reporting. Air refueling command and control reporting will be in
accordance with Chapter 2 of this instruction.
 190                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


15.5. MARSA Applicability for Aerial Refueling. MARSA begins between tanker and
receiver when tanker advises ATC it is accepting MARSA. MARSA is not an ICAO recognized
term. If in doubt as to what separation is provided by ATC, or what separation the aircrew is
responsible for, query the controlling agency.
   15.5.1. After MARSA has been declared, controller-assigned course or altitude changes
   prior to rendezvous completion will automatically void MARSA and are to be avoided.
   15.5.2. Once the rendezvous is completed, headings and altitude assignments may be made
   with the tanker concurrence with MARSA remaining in effect.
   15.5.3. Upon rendezvous completion, receiver aircraft shall remain within 3 miles of the
   tanker until MARSA is terminated.
   15.5.4. After air refueling clearance is received and until rendezvous is completed, aerial
   refueling airspace from the ARIP to the ARCP is sterilized. After rendezvous is completed
   and tankers or receivers proceed down track, other non-participating aircraft may be cleared
   through the refueling block airspace with proper separation.
   15.5.5. MARSA ends between the tanker and receiver when the tanker advises ATC the
   tanker and receiver aircraft are vertically positioned within the air refueling airspace and
   ATC advises MARSA is terminated.
15.6. Altitude Reservations. An ALTRV is authorization by a central altitude reservation
function (CARF, EUCARF, PACMARF, and CARU) or appropriate ARTCC/CERAP under
certain circumstances, for airspace utilization under prescribed conditions. Air refueling on
operational missions often utilizes an ALTRV under these conditions. ALTRVs may include all,
a portion, or portions of the intended route of flight. Request and approval format can be found
in FAA 7610.4.
   15.6.1. PICs will ensure ALTRV approval is received prior to mission execution. ALTRV
   status may be verified through the appropriate 618 AOC (TACC) cell.
   15.6.2. Aircraft must depart within assigned AVANA (ALTRV Void if Aircraft Not
   Airborne) time for the purpose of providing separation between altitude reservations. Normal
   AVANA will be 1 hour. If a mission is to be delayed beyond the AVANA time, coordinate
   with the C2 authority as soon as possible. Rescheduling will normally be in 24-hour
   increments after the original schedule.
   15.6.3. Aircraft on an ALTRV must operate within the altitude, time, and areas specified in
   the approval. An ALTRV APVL authorizes the aircraft to climb or descend as specified.
   Controllers are not required to issue a climb or descent clearance for the various flight
   segments. They may, however, request that the pilot advise them prior to initiating an altitude
   change.
   15.6.4. In a non-radar environment, aircraft shall advise ATC if actual fix timing will be
   more than plus or minus 5 minutes from the planned ALTRV en route fix estimate.
   15.6.5. File flight plans (DD Forms 1801 or 175) containing ALTRVs IAW FLIP GP.
   Include ALTRV name in the remarks section of the flight plan. ALTRV requests or
   approvals do not eliminate the responsibility to obtain proper diplomatic clearance or file
   flight plans.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 191


15.7. Receiver Pilot Responsibilities. Receiver Pilots are responsible for:
   15.7.1. Squawking normal when separation from the tanker is greater than 3 miles.
   15.7.2. Maintaining two-way radio contact with ATC until cleared to the AAR block
   altitude, established in that block, and cleared to the AAR frequency by ATC.
   15.7.3. Pilots are reminded that oceanic clearances and an acknowledged readback are
   required for all flights within North Atlantic (NAT) controlled airspace. References for
   oceanic clearance procedures are FLIP Area Planning (AP)/2 and the NAT Minimum
   Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) Manual.
       15.7.3.1. Receiver pilots will not rely on the tanker to obtain and readback oceanic
       clearance. To the maximum extent possible, receiver pilots should obtain their own,
       individual clearance from the oceanic control authority of the airspace in which they
       intend to operate, prior to entering oceanic airspace. Pilots will request oceanic clearance
       prior to oceanic entry point IAW procedures established in AP/2 and NAT MNPS
       Manual. Consider obtaining clearance and providing read-back prior to rendezvous and
       air refueling.
       15.7.3.2. Tanker aircraft will not accomplish clearance read-back for receiver aircraft.
       Receiver PICs are responsible for ensuring that oceanic clearance is always read-back to
       the controlling authority by a member of their crew, and acknowledged by the oceanic
       controlling authority, prior to entering oceanic airspace.
   15.7.4. Opportune Air Refueling.
       15.7.4.1. PICs must receive permission from controlling authority (OG/CC, 618 AOC
       (TACC), etc.) prior to accomplishing opportune AAR.
15.8. Tanker Pilot Responsibilities. Tanker Pilots are responsible for:
   15.8.1. Remaining within the protected lateral, longitudinal, and vertical airspace of the
   refueling track or anchor including orbit patterns.
   15.8.2. Notifying the appropriate ATC facility of all altitudes vacated and not anticipated for
   further use by refueling aircraft. Such altitudes shall not be reoccupied without further ATC
   clearance.
   15.8.3. Receiver navigation, regardless of the number of tankers or receivers, after
   rendezvous completion through completion of refueling operations (AAR and MARSA have
   been terminated) except when under control responsibility of a military radar facility while in
   an anchor area.
   15.8.4. Maintaining communications with the appropriate ATC facility. All communications
   during refueling operations, including those concerning receivers, shall be between the ATC
   facility or military radar unit and tanker. To the extent practical, receivers shall establish
   communications with the tanker prior to or when departing the ARIP on the specified AR
   frequency. The tanker shall assume position reporting responsibility for the receivers upon
   rendezvous completion.
   15.8.5. Coordinating altitude and route clearance:
 192                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


       15.8.5.1. From the ATC facility for receivers and tanker at least 5 minutes prior to
       refueling completion except when both aircraft are operating on an approved altitude
       reservation (ALTRV).
       15.8.5.2. Through the radar controller when operating in refueling anchors with military
       ground radar. At least 5 minutes prior to completing refueling operations, the military
       radar facility shall forward requests to the assigned ATC facility and subsequently relay
       ATC clearances for the tanker and receiver aircraft from the ATC facility.
       15.8.5.3. Tanker aircrews should not normally obtain oceanic clearances for receiver
       aircraft intending to operate in NAT oceanic airspace. Tanker aircrews will not read-back
       receiver aircraft oceanic clearance. This is a receiver pilot responsibility.
   15.8.6. Vertically position aircraft prior to reaching the planned exit point to facilitate the
   safe and efficient transfer of separation responsibility from the military, under the provisions
   of MARSA, to the ATC facility on completion of refueling operations. Vertical separation of
   receivers and tankers shall be accomplished within the assigned altitudes.
   15.8.7. Providing each receiver, upon request, with the aircraft's position at the completion
   of refueling operations. Additional information concerning amendments or changes to the
   receiver's ATC clearance shall also be provided as appropriate.
   15.8.8. Coordinating all refueling formation operations to ensure all aircraft are in proper
   post air refueling formation prior to cell breakup. Prior to terminating air refueling, the lead
   tanker will confirm all aircraft in the formation are in proper post air refueling position with
   required lateral/vertical separation.
   15.8.9. Accomplishing Search and Rescue (SAR) procedures IAW AFI 11-207, Combat
   Aircraft Delivery. In an emergency, the flight leader immediately notifies the tanker
   commander. The tanker aircrew notifies ATC. In the event of a downed or ditched receiver,
   ATC notifies the Rescue Coordination Center, which in turn alerts the nearest SAR assets.
   The tanker provides cover as long as fuel reserves allow. Remaining receivers proceed
   unescorted to the nearest abort base or continue the mission with remaining tankers.
   15.8.10. Opportune Air Refueling.
       15.8.10.1. PICs must receive permission from controlling authority (OG/CC, 618 AOC
       (TACC), etc.) prior to accomplishing opportune AAR with US receivers.
15.9. ATC Clearance. AAR operations are normally conducted on tracks or anchor areas
published in DOD FLIP. Operational considerations may require AAR outside published areas
or within an ALTRV. The tanker PIC shall receive specific ATC clearance from the appropriate
ATC facility for the following:
   15.9.1. Entry to/exit from assigned aerial refueling altitude block (except on an approved
   ALTRV).
   15.9.2. Altitudes requested for tanker and receiver aircraft upon completion of air refueling.
   15.9.3. Routing for each aircraft or formation flight when exiting the refueling track prior to
   or beyond the exit point, or different from the flight plan routing.
   15.9.4. Extending refueling operations beyond the track or anchor exit point due to adverse
   weather or winds, mission requirements, etc.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  193


   15.9.5. Use of altitudes in excess of those for which specific clearance has been granted (i.e.,
   tobogganing). NOTE: Protected airspace for AAR tracks is defined in FAA order 7610.4N
   SPECIAL OPERATIONS (or current version). If tankers need to exceed these bounds to
   accomplish the rendezvous, they must request clearance from ATC prior to exiting the
   protected orbit pattern airspace.
15.10. Emergency AAR. When an emergency AAR requirement arises, units tasked will
attempt to fill the requirement from available unit resources. Use unit training sorties as first
priority and generated alert sorties as second priority. If no capability exists, notify the
controlling agency of the requirement and unit shortfall. The following procedures apply for unit
C2 personnel:
   15.10.1. Units will not routinely preposition additional aircraft to satisfy potential
   emergency AAR requirements.
   15.10.2. Time permitting, coordinate emergency AAR requirements with receiver parent
   MAJCOM.
   15.10.3. The unit command post should coordinate or direct unit actions.
   15.10.4. Identify unit sortie when notified of emergency air refueling requirement.
   15.10.5. Coordinate with OG/CC.
   15.10.6. Notify 618 AOC (TACC) of requirement and proposed actions.
   15.10.7. Notify squadron or aircrew of requirement. Provide ARCT, rendezvous
   information, altitude, receiver call sign, and communication plan.
   15.10.8. Advise receiver of planned actions.
   15.10.9. Notify the ARTCC liaison of requirement.
15.11. Air-to-Air Refueling with Foreign Aircraft. ATP-56 serves as the source document for
air refueling information among participating countries and is no longer limited to NATO
countries only.
   15.11.1. Tankers will only refuel those aircraft listed in ATP-56 or specifically authorized by
   HQ AMC/A3V. Receiver aircraft not previously certified for refueling operations (includes
   foreign variants of US-produced aircraft) must be certified for technical and operational
   compatibility in accordance with USAF regulations prior to refueling.
   15.11.2. AAR of foreign aircraft must be tasked by proper C2 authority. Opportune AAR of
   foreign aircraft is prohibited.
15.12. Coronet East Mission Over Flights in France. Aircrews must explicitly follow pre-
coordinated mission profiles on missions that transit French airspace. Although ALTRVs are not
formally recognized in the French ATC system, pre-coordinated Coronet East Missions are
afforded a certain degree of additional protection while in French airspace. In exchange for this
special handling, it is absolutely essential aircrews adhere to pre-coordinated routes and altitudes
to avoid problems (including the portion of the flight to/from the ALTRV). Failure to do so
creates difficult diplomatic situations and jeopardizes future authorization for US Military over
flights of France. Aircrews will not request any maneuvers that have not been coordinated in
advance with French ATC. Examples of these maneuvers include formation split up and rejoin
 194                                                  AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


(unless pre-coordinated). During the portion of the flight to/from the ALTRV, tanker and
receivers must remain in formation at a single altitude while in French airspace. If a request
(even if pre-coordinated) is denied by the controller, follow their instructions.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                195

                                    MISSION PLANNING

16.1. General. This chapter standardizes procedures for planning, briefing, and reviewing all
missions. The PIC is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the mission materials. Unit
mission planning facilities should possess essential mission planning material.
   16.1.1. Mission planning is normally conducted the day before the mission. Operations
   group commanders may elect to use a “same day mission plan” option.
   16.1.2. Mission Commander. Chapter 2, paragraph 2.6, of this instruction specifies mission
   commander requirements and qualification criteria. AFTTP 3-1.KC10/KC-135 contains a
   mission commander's checklist that is intended to assist mission commanders with their
   duties and responsibilities.
   16.1.3. Theater Indoctrination Folders (Part IV of FCIF) should provide additional
   information for aircrew and planning staff review (Not applicable for ANG or AFRC).
16.2. Briefings.
   16.2.1. Pre-Deployment Briefing. Prior to deployments, the operations officer, mission
   commander, or designated representative should assemble the crew and brief description and
   purpose of the mission, tentative itinerary, aircraft configuration, special equipment, fuel
   load, clothing required, anticipated housing and messing facilities, sufficient money to defray
   individual’s anticipated expenses, personal equipment/field equipment requirements, special
   clearance requirements, and flying safety.
   16.2.2. Other Briefings. In addition to the briefings above, mission participants will also
   conduct briefings as required in paragraph 6.12 of this AFI.
16.3. Mission Debriefings. Hold immediately after the mission if practical. In addition to the
requirements in paragraph 6.12, include the following:
   16.3.1. Aircrews will attend the operations and maintenance debriefings as directed by unit
   or mission commander. Maintenance debrief should be conducted ASAP after flight.
   16.3.2. Intelligence debriefings will be accomplished as soon as practical after mission
   recovery, normally within 30 minutes. Debriefings will be as prescribed in
   USTRANSCOMR 200-3, Intelligence Debriefing and Reporting.
   16.3.3. Aircrew Debrief. Mission critiques and debriefings are perhaps the most important
   learning tool available to aircrews and will be done after each mission. All crewmembers will
   attend. Use this time to review the entire mission.
 196                                                       AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013

                                        EMPLOYMENT

17.1. General. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.KC-135 for additional guidance on tactics training, specific
maneuver descriptions, and tactical maneuver procedures. All crewmembers must complete
tactics certification IAW AFI 11-2KC-135V1. NOTE: Certain technical information was
intentionally omitted or generalized to keep this chapter unclassified. Users should be aware that
written additions to any portion of this document could cause the manual to become classified.
17.2. Responsibilities. The tactics training program is a coordinated effort between the unit’s
intelligence office, wing/group training office, and wing/group weapons and tactics flight, in
order to ensure continuity and the unit’s specific mission tasking is addressed.
   17.2.1. Tactics Reference Library and Tactics Read File. The unit tactics officer is
   responsible for developing procedures for timely dissemination of tactical information to unit
   aircrew members. See AMCI 11-207, AMC Weapons and Tactics Program, for the Tactics
   Reference Library.
17.3. Tactics Flight Training.
   17.3.1. Tactical Maneuvers. Accomplish tactical maneuvers IAW procedures provided in
   AFTTP 3-3.KC-135. Once certified, tactical maneuvers may be flown on continuation
   training and operational missions with passengers on board. Notify passengers prior to
   conducting tactics maneuvers training.
   17.3.2. Objectives. Accomplish all flight maneuvers with strict adherence to aircraft
   limitations as defined in KC-135 tech orders and this AFI.
   17.3.3. Flight Training Limitations and Restrictions:
       17.3.3.1. Limitations. The following limitations apply to all in-flight tactics training.
           17.3.3.1.1. Aircraft tactical arrival and departure training is limited to three-ship
           formation, VMC, 45 degree angle of bank maximum, and 500’ AGL minimum

           17.3.3.1.2. Aircraft scram training is limited to VMC, 45 degree angle of bank
           maximum, 10,000’ AGL minimum altitude. Scatter turns are limited to two-ship
           formations. EXCEPTION: Scatter turns are limited to three-ship formations for 509th
           WPS.
               17.3.3.1.2.1. Combat descents done in conjunction with formation scram training
               require IP supervision on one of the aircraft for the purpose of managing
               formation de-confliction. NOTE: When accomplishing a turning combat descent
               as single ship or formation, conduct in VMC under IP supervision.
           17.3.3.1.3. Limit formation in-place turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank and
           90 degrees of turn. EXCEPTION: Up to 180 degrees of turn and 45 degrees of bank
           angle for 509 WPS.
       17.3.3.2. Intercept Training Restrictions/Procedures. See AFI 11-214, Air Operations
       Rules and Procedures, for specific guidance.

17.4. Emergency Airlift of Personnel.
   17.4.1. Reference T.O. 1C-135-9, Cargo Loading Manual. Beginning at the floor fittings at
   BS 1140, install tie-down rings in the outer most fittings left (LBL 51.90) & right (RBL
   51.90) side of aircraft & one fitting left (LBL 11.75) or right (RBL 11.75) of center. If
   sidewall seats (one or both sides) are used aft of the over-wing hatches then move tie-down
   rings inboard one tie-down fitting position on the side the seats are down, & do not use a
   center tie-down ring. Lace one strap through center shackle, Seat two passengers on the
   narrow side of center fitting and three passengers on the wider side. Route straps laterally
   across their legs (attempt to keep the ratchet on the same side of the cargo compartment) and
   ratchet strap snug. Be cautious of making strap too tight to restrict blood circulation in the
   legs of passengers. Continue procedure with next forward row of floor fittings.
      17.4.1.1. One small carry-on bag placed in passenger’s lap is permitted.
   17.4.2. The maximum altitude for emergency airlift will not exceed FL250.
   17.4.3. For airlift of patients, see Chapter 20 of this instruction.

                                          Chapter 18

                                  AIRCRAFT FORMATION

18.1. General. This chapter covers basic formation procedures and operations. All procedures
described apply to all KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft. The broad term “formation” as used does not
differentiate between specific tactics of en route formation or visual formation. Specific
references to each tactic must be made to ensure complete understanding.
   18.1.1. All formation flights will be planned, briefed, and critiqued in accordance with the
   applicable Technical Order, this chapter, ATP-56 and AFTTP 3-3.KC-135.
   18.1.2. These procedures are standardized with KC-10 formation operations.
18.2. Specified Times. The formation leader determines the sequence of events (SOEs) and
mission times based on mission requirements. Local SOEs for formation training missions may
be established for use at home station. Changes in briefing or mission timing will be relayed to
all formation members at the earliest opportunity.
18.3. Weather Minimums. Comply with weather minimums for takeoff and landing
established in AFI 11-202V3 and Chapter 6 of this instruction.
18.4. Ground Operations. The formation leader should accomplish radio checks and copy
ATC clearance in the chocks. All formation members should make every effort to accomplish
HAVE QUICK and SECURE VOICE radio operations on all local formation training missions.
All participating crews will accomplish as much of the pre-takeoff checklists as possible prior to
taxi. Lead will obtain taxi and takeoff clearance.
18.5. Communications and Radio Procedures. Radio and interphone discipline are critical
factors in maintaining formation integrity. The formation leader will ensure all formation
members have a complete understanding of the radio monitoring plan.
   18.5.1. Formation will not be flown on training sorties without inter-plane voice
   communications capability.
   18.5.2. When radio silent operations are required, the formation leader will pre-brief all
   formation members on specific procedures for frequency changes (i.e. timing, visual signals,
   etc.).
   18.5.3. The flight lead will initiate all frequency changes. Lead will allow enough time for
   frequency change to be accomplished before initiating check-in. Lead must ensure all flight
   members are on frequency before initiating any action or making any radio calls to ARTCC,
   etc. If a flight member does not respond, a secondary radio or guard may be used to direct the
   wingman to the proper frequency. Specific procedures should be pre-briefed by the flight
   lead. Crews should maintain non-primary radios during silent operations; however, planned
   frequency changes may be performed on briefed timing or visual signals. All flight members
   must be on a common frequency.
18.6. Launch, Departure, and Level-Off.
   18.6.1. Formation Briefing. The formation leader will conduct a detailed briefing for all
   crewmembers covering the planned activities, procedures, techniques, specific EMCON
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  199


  procedures, and division of formation responsibilities. PICs may excuse crewmembers from
  the formation briefing to perform preflight duties, however the PIC will back brief all
  appropriate items. If lead changes are planned, each formation lead will brief their portion of
  the mission. The formation leader will ensure all crewmembers thoroughly understand their
  responsibilities, to include assumption of formation leadership.
     18.6.1.1. When deviations from the briefed mission are necessary, they will be directed
     by the leader. No actions will be taken until they have been coordinated with and are
     understood by all formation members.
     18.6.1.2. Non-collocated Units. If aircraft depart from separate bases and then
     rendezvous for formation activity, the formation lead should make every effort to conduct
     a telephone briefing with joining tanker and receiver formation leaders. If this is not
     possible, after detailed sortie study, the coordination and briefing between the appropriate
     lead planning agencies or mission commanders will satisfy formation briefing
     requirements. At a minimum, radio contact will be established between all formation
     aircraft NLT 15 minutes prior to join up. The formation lead will ensure altitude
     separation for aircraft in the formation or joining the formation. Coordination of these
     formations will include designation of mission commander responsibilities for all phases
     of the formation operation.
     18.6.1.3. Unit Responsibilities. Each unit will develop post takeoff separation procedures
     and departure separation plans with the local controlling agency. Each plan must consider
     emergency aspects, aircraft performance capabilities, terrain features, penetration of
     weather after takeoff, and local ATC restrictions. Procedures should also be developed
     for items such as aborts, lost communications, EMCON, and the recovery of formation
     aircraft.
  18.6.2. Filing Procedures. Flight plans for all formation members will reflect the same route
  of flight for the portion of flight the aircraft will be in formation. Local procedures for filing
  may be used provided they are coordinated and documented in writing by the unit and local
  FAA (or ICAO) representatives. Formation flights which do not consist of all RVSM aircraft
  will be considered non-RVSM compliant and will have 2,000 ft vertical separation standards
  applied in RVSM airspace.
  18.6.3. Taxi Procedures. Follow the taxi sequence established in the briefing. Maintain safe
  interval and a safe speed during taxi.
  18.6.4. Takeoff Timing Interval. Defined as the time between initiation of takeoff power for
  each successive aircraft in the formation. Use of takeoff power radio calls is not
  recommended. Minimum takeoff timing interval is 60 seconds between KC-135 and other
  non-KC-135 aircraft in the formation. Minimum timing interval between KC-135s is 30
  seconds. Takeoff interval may be extended and sequence may be varied as necessary
  depending on aircraft acceleration and performance, training requirements, weather, airfield
  conditions, and mission requirements.
  18.6.5. Formation Takeoff Procedure (Hold-Line through Takeoff). Receivers should takeoff
  first. Any time take off is aborted, an abort call will be made by the aborting aircraft over the
  ATC radio frequency being used by the formation. At bases with dual runway operations,
200                                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


  aborting aircraft will identify the runway in use. An additional radio call announcing an
  abort is recommended over the formation interplane frequency.
  18.6.6. Departure. (N/A Fighter Buddy Departure) Climb speed below 10,000 feet MSL is
  250 KIAS, unless a higher speed is required to accommodate the minimum safe maneuvering
  speed of the heaviest aircraft in the formation (N/A USAFE). Planned climb speed will not
  be less than the heaviest aircraft’s 3-Engine Climbout + 50kts. Above 10,000 feet MSL the
  normal planned climb speed is 285 KIAS. Above 10,000 feet MSL, for mixed KC-10/KC-
  135 cell formation departures, the normal planned departure speed is 295 KIAS (NOTE: this
  equates to 290 knots in the KC-10) for formations with KC-10s less than 500,000 pounds
  gross weight and 315 KIAS (NOTE: this equates to 310knots in the KC-10) for formations
  with KC-10s equal to or greater than 500,000 pounds gross weight. Planned climb speeds
  apply to the lead aircraft only. Following aircraft may exceed/lag these speeds as necessary
  to accomplish the rejoin and maintain proper formation position. Climb speed schedules
  which result in KC-10s climbing with slats extended will be avoided. If visual, radar, A/A
  TACAN, TCAS, and radio contact are all lost, and altitude separation cannot be ensured, lost
  wingman and locally developed abort procedures will be accomplished.
      18.6.6.1. Formation Join-Up. Differential airspeed and/or visual cut-off in departure
      turns are the approved methods for formation join-up. The use of visual cut-off is
      restricted to day/VMC operations only and requires approval from ATC. Altitude
      separation will be carefully monitored during closure to en route spacing. Under other
      than VMC or when visual contact cannot be maintained with all formation members,
      altitude separation will be accomplished using TCAS or by periodically having each
      aircraft in the formation report its altitude or flight level. During night or instrument
      flight conditions, aircraft should turn at the same geographic points as the preceding
      aircraft.
      18.6.6.2. Buddy Departures (Tanker Snake/Formation Climb Procedures). Buddy
      departures may be used by collocated tanker and fighter or bomber units. The intent of
      this type of departure is to facilitate the join-up of receivers with their mated tankers. The
      procedures below are generalized and may require modification based on aircraft and
      airspace limitations.
         18.6.6.2.1. VMC Procedures. VMC procedures may be used when weather (ceiling
         and visibility) is 3000/5 or greater. Receivers will normally launch first and intercept
         an arc to place themselves on extended (approximately 10 NM) final to the departure
         runway. When the receiver calls 10 NM final, or the last receiver turns cross wind, or
         on predetermined timing, the tanker will launch. Continue with a straight ahead rejoin
         or according to briefed departure routing.
         18.6.6.2.2. IMC Procedures. Under IMC or when weather is less than 3000/5, plan to
         rendezvous the formation at an orbit point along the route of flight. Tankers will
         normally launch first unless mission fuel load and performance considerations dictate
         otherwise. Receivers should be rejoined prior to rendezvous with the tankers.
  18.6.7. Level-Off. An altitude block will be obtained for all intermediate and final level-off
  altitudes. Block altitudes will provide a minimum of 500-foot separation between aircraft. If
  ARTCC will not approve a block altitude, then request IFR separation or hard IFR altitudes
  for each aircraft in formation. Stack down from lead during intermediate level-off altitudes.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                   201


   18.6.8. Airborne Aborts. Any aborting aircraft will clear the planned launch stream and take
   appropriate actions dictated by the reason for abort. Aborting aircraft will obtain ATC
   clearance prior to altering their route, or declare an emergency and deviate as necessary. The
   formation leader and other formation members should be ready to assist the aborting aircraft
   in any way possible.
18.7. En route Formation. En route formation consists of multiple tanker aircraft in trail,
stacked up at 500-foot intervals with 1 NM separation (2 NM may be used for contingency
operations). The primary means of maintaining proper formation position are TCAS under
instrument conditions and visual or TCAS under visual conditions. When visual conditions
permit, minimize radio transmissions. Heading and airspeed changes need not be announced. In
IMC, the formation leader should ensure all formation members are aware of heading and
airspeed changes, either through thorough pre-briefing, or use of inter-plane communications.
Aircrews will monitor the position of all other aircraft and, on inter-plane, notify any aircraft
excessively out of position.
   18.7.1. Turns. The formation leader should pre-brief specific bank angles for turns. This
   will help reduce inter-plane communications and aid in maintaining formation position. To
   maintain formation position during turns, all aircraft must initiate the turn over the same
   geographic point, unless executing a formation retrograde maneuver as described in AFTTP
   3-3.KC-135.
   18.7.2. Airspeed and Altitude. Formation climbs and descents will be accomplished using a
   constant airspeed and vertical velocity. The formation leader will ensure en route airspeed is
   compatible with the most restrictive aircraft in the formation.
   18.7.3. Autopilot Operations. The autopilot should be used to reduce fatigue and aid in
   altitude separation. Consideration should be given to placing an aircraft with an inoperative
   or malfunctioning autopilot in last position in the formation for missions with extended
   duration in formation.
   18.7.4. Visual Station-Keeping. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.KC-135 for visual station-keeping
   techniques. During operational situations requiring EMCON 3 or 4, and marginal visibility
   prohibits normal formation spacing, a compressed trail formation may be used. Formations
   may be compressed, but should not be less than 250 feet stacked up and 1/2NM spacing
   between aircraft.
   18.7.5. Formation Navigation Procedures. Cell lead is responsible for the navigation of the
   entire formation.
       18.7.5.1. The primary responsibility of cell aircraft is station keeping. Cell aircraft, other
       than lead, should accomplish necessary navigation requirements to assume lead should
       the necessity arise.
   18.7.6. Navigation coordination between aircraft within the formation is encouraged unless
   operational (EMCON) restrictions or AAR requirements limit communication. Do not
   jeopardize formation tactics or integrity for this purpose. However, if cell aircraft detect a
   known navigation error, inform lead immediately.
18.8. Lost Wingman Procedures. These procedures are to be used when visual, radar, TCAS,
or radio contact cannot be maintained and altitude separation cannot be ensured. In any lost
 202                                                       AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


wingman situation, immediate separation of aircraft is essential to safety. Upon losing all contact
with the leader, or if unable to maintain formation due to disorientation, the wingman will
simultaneously execute the applicable lost wingman procedure while transitioning to
instruments. The bank angle used to achieve separation should equal the number of degrees to be
turned. Smooth application of control inputs is imperative to minimize the effects of spatial
disorientation. Any aircraft, which can maintain contact with an aircraft executing a lost
wingman maneuver will remain in formation with that aircraft until otherwise directed by the
leader. When lead is notified of a lost wingman, lead will take appropriate action, as the situation
dictates, until positive separation is assured. Lead will establish a reference heading and altitude
after initial separation is assured. During recovery, if the flight has a block altitude clearance,
wingmen will establish appropriate altitude separation.
   18.8.1. Two Aircraft Flights:
       18.8.1.1. In wings-level flight (climbing, descending, or level) simultaneously transition
       to instruments, inform lead, turn 15 degrees away and maintain new heading for 15
       seconds, then resume course. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearance if required.
       18.8.1.2. In turns (climbing, descending, or level):
           18.8.1.2.1. On the outside of the turn, transition to instruments, roll to wings level
           and inform the leader. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to resuming
           turn. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearance as required.
           18.8.1.2.2. On the inside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments to
           maintain established bank angle, reduce airspeed by 10 KIAS to ensure clearance, and
           inform lead. Lead will simultaneously roll wings level, maintain airspeed, and
           acknowledge wingman's call. If lead has acknowledged the lost wingman call and
           confirms he or she has rolled wings level, the wingman will, after 15 seconds, roll
           wings level, establish 500 feet altitude separation, turn to lead's referenced heading
           and attempt to acquire lead on radar/TCAS. If loss of visual contact is not
           acknowledged by lead, maintain established bank angle, establish 500 feet altitude
           separation, roll out on new heading, attempt to acquire lead on radar/TCAS, and form
           into enroute formation position. If TCAS or radar contact cannot be re-established,
           obtain separate clearance from the controlling agency.
   18.8.2. Three Aircraft Flights. If only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the
   procedures above would provide safe separation. However, as it is impossible for number
   three to immediately ascertain that number two still has visual contact with the leader, it is
   imperative number three's initial action be based on the assumption number two has also
   become separated. If number two is still in visual, TCAS, or radar contact, he or she will
   maintain position. If number two goes lost wingman, he or she will follow the procedures
   outlined above. Number three will follow the procedures listed below:
       18.8.2.1. In wings level flight (climbing, descending, or level) simultaneously transition
       to instruments, inform lead, turn 30 degrees away, and maintain new heading for 30
       seconds, then resume course. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearances as
       required.
       18.8.2.2. In turns (climbing, descending, level):
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                203


          18.8.2.2.1. In the outside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments, inform
          lead and reverse direction of turn for 15 seconds to ensure separation from lead and
          number two. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearance as required.
          18.8.2.2.2. In the inside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments to
          maintain established bank angle, reduce airspeed by 20 KIAS to ensure clearance, and
          inform lead. Lead will simultaneously roll wings level, maintain airspeed and
          acknowledge the wingman's call. If lead has acknowledged the lost wingman call and
          confirms he or she has rolled wings level, number three will, after 30 seconds, roll
          wings level, establish 1000 feet altitude separation, turn to lead's referenced heading,
          and attempt to acquire lead and number two on TCAS and radar. If loss of visual
          contact is not acknowledged by lead, maintain established bank angle, establish 1000
          feet altitude separation, roll out on new heading, attempt to acquire lead on TCAS and
          radar, and form into en route formation position. If TCAS or radar contact is not re-
          established, obtain separate clearance from the controlling agency.
   18.8.3. Lost Wingman Procedures during Receiver AAR. Depending on the makeup of the
   AAR formation, it is possible that in the event of a breakaway, receiver aircraft may find
   themselves co- altitude with another aircraft in the formation. If, during a breakaway, the
   receiver aircraft loses sight of the tanker aircraft, T.O. 1-1C-1-14 requires the receiver
   aircraft to descend to an altitude 1000 feet below the tanker. In the event this places the
   receiver aircraft co-altitude with another aircraft in the formation, immediately coordinate a
   de-conflicted altitude with tanker lead. If unable to immediately contact tanker lead and
   visual, A/A TACAN, TCAS, radar, or radio contact with the co-altitude aircraft cannot be
   maintained, descend to an altitude that will provide positive separation from other aircraft
   and decrease airspeed to ensure lateral separation.
18.9. Formation Position Changes. Follow the procedures described in AFTTP 3-3.KC-135,
Chapter 5.
18.10. Formation Break-Up and Recovery. Formation separation procedures will be
thoroughly planned and briefed by the formation leader. Do not initiate formation separation
procedures without ATC approval.
   18.10.1. If formation descent and arrival is desired, detailed descent profile, airspeed
   reduction, and configuration procedures will be thoroughly briefed.
18.11. Mission Debriefing and Critique. A complete mission debriefing and critique should
be conducted by the formation leader following the mission.
18.12. Definitions.
   18.12.1. A standard formation is one in which a proximity of no more than 1-mile laterally
   or longitudinally and 100 feet vertically from the flight leader is maintained by each
   wingman.
   18.12.2. Nonstandard formations are those operating under any of the following conditions:
       18.12.2.1. When the flight leader has requested and ARTCC has approved other than
       standard formation dimensions.
       18.12.2.2. When operating within an authorized ALTRV or under the provisions of a
       letter of agreement.

      18.12.2.3. When operations are conducted in airspace specifically designed for special
      activity.
  18.12.3. Most formations are nonstandard and should be so indicated in the remarks section
  of the filed flight plan. Flight leaders are required to advise ARTCC on initial contact, and
  each sub- sequent controller or controlling agency, of separation being used. Advisories are
  not required when operating within an ALTRV or airspace specifically designed for
  formation flight activity.

                             AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION

Section 20A—General Information

20.1. Mission.
   20.1.1. This chapter applies to Air Force KC-135 Aircrews, aeromedical evacuation aircrew
   members (AECM) and all management levels concerned with aeromedical evacuation (AE)
   operations of KC-135 aircraft. All operators involved will use this chapter in conjunction
   with AFI 11-2AEV3, Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Operations Procedures for all KC-135
   AE missions.
   20.1.2. Use of KC-135 aircraft for AE transport of ill or injured DoD members and their
   dependents is authorized. C2 agencies may direct AE missions aboard KC-135s at any time.
   AECM will utilize procedures in applicable AFI 11-2AE and AFI 41-307, in conjunction
   with this publication, to accomplish the AE mission.
   20.1.3. Maximum souls on board will not exceed guidance published in AFI 11-2AEV3,
   Addenda A. At no time will there be more personnel on board than seatbelts available.
20.2. Operational Control and Reporting of Aeromedical Evacuation Forces.
   20.2.1. HQ AMC is lead command for AE. HQ AMC Directorate of Operations (AMC/A3)
   is the executive agent for operational AE missions.
   20.2.2. Command and control (C2) of AE missions is the same as other airlift missions.
   20.2.3. Aircraft Commander (AC) is the qualified pilot-in-command (PIC) responsible for
   command and control of all persons aboard the aircraft during an AE mission. In matters of
   flight safety, crew duty waivers, or operational considerations, their decisions are final. In
   matters of patient care, the medical crew director MCD decisions are final.
   20.2.4. Medical Crew Director (MCD). The MCD is a qualified flight nurse responsible for
   the overall supervision of patient care and management of AEC assigned to AE missions.
   He/she advises the PIC on patients’ conditions and the use of medical equipment that may
   affect aircraft operations. The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and medical well-
   being of patients on the aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures with
   supporting agencies. In matters of patient care, the decisions of the MCD are final.
20.3. Alerting Procedures.
   20.3.1. At all locations AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC/MCD. The MCD will alert the
   medical crew. The goal is to link the primary PIC, local AMC C2 agency and MCD before
   mission execution.
   20.3.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will contact
   AMC local C2 agency and establish alert, show time, etc. with the C2 agency. The MCD will
   make every effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission irregularities prior to
   crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-emergency. Crew rest
   will be based on scheduled launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 207


   20.3.3. The local AMC C2 agency will provide PIC/MCD AE mission information when
   he/she checks on mission status. Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE crews and
   the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both parties without interruption of crew
   rest.
   20.3.4. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of patient(s) and
   aircraft availability. There may be occasions when aircraft cannot depart (i.e. MX problems)
   or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE crew from the flight crew. The
   MCD will brief any changes to the PIC and local AMC C2 to de-conflict potential problems.
20.4. Pilot In Command Responsibilities.
   20.4.1. Establish communication link with the MCD during pre-mission planning and
   throughout the mission.
   20.4.2. Brief AECMs on the mission, flight plan, flight profile, and current threat (as
   applicable).
   20.4.3. The PIC will fully integrate all crewmembers into a single crew throughout the
   mission, including en route transportation, dining, billeting, etc.
   20.4.4. Coordinate with MCD and C2 agencies for cabin altitude/flight restrictions based on
   patient requirements. When the sortie is being flight managed, coordinate flight restrictions
   with the FM if the FM provided plan needs to be modified.
   20.4.5. Advise AECMs of intentions to start engines, taxi, itinerary changes, in-flight
   difficulties, and additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
   20.4.6. Brief MCD on additional responsibilities of flight crewmembers.
20.5. Boom Operator Responsibilities.
   20.5.1. Assist the AE crew with aircraft systems.
   20.5.2. Coordinate emergency evacuation plan with MCD.
      20.5.2.1. Provide a thorough evacuation brief to AECMs.
   20.5.3. Operate aircraft systems, i.e., heat/air conditioning, emergency exits, etc.
   20.5.4. Assist the AECMs as necessary, as long as such assistance does not interfere with
   primary duties.
   20.5.5. Ensure aircraft is prepared for AE mission.
      20.5.5.1. Perform cargo loading preflight IAW T.O. 1C-135-9.
      20.5.5.2. Supervise loading of patient support pallets (PSP).
      20.5.5.3. Assist with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
   20.5.6. Transmit load messages and radio transmissions to tasking AE C2 agency as
   requested by the MCD.
   20.5.7. Teach LL03C – Egress training to AECMs. IAW 11-2AE V1, qualified BO
   instructors and non-instructor boom operators and loadmasters may teach emergency egress
   training for AECMs prior to flight or prior to enplaning patients, provided that the training is
   “hands-on,” covers all requirements of LL03 and is documented on AF Form 1522.

20.6. Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Responsibilities.
   20.6.1. Responsible for patient clinical care activities including loading, positioning, and
   offloading.
       20.6.1.1. Coordinate with PIC for cabin altitude/flight restrictions based on patient
       requirements.
   20.6.2. Configure aircraft for AE operations.
   20.6.3. Install/secure and remove medical equipment/supplies.
       20.6.3.1. Do not use seat track/stanchion fitting ring(s) to secure any equipment.
   20.6.4. Assist the BO with observation of passengers when it does not interfere with primary
   duties.
       20.6.4.1. Non-medical attendants are the responsibility of AECMs.
   20.6.5. The MCD or designated AECM should be on aircraft inter-phone (headset) for all
   phases of flight, and will be on aircraft inter-phone during critical phases of flight to include
   take-off and landing.
   20.6.6. The MCD will ensure a patient position plan is given to the PIC or BO NLT 2 ½
   hours prior to scheduled departure time.
20.7. Ground Operations.
   20.7.1. All engines will be shut down during enplaning and deplaning of patients.
   20.7.2. Temperature. Be cognizant of high cabin temperatures during ground operations.
   20.7.3. The PIC/BO should request an air conditioning cart whenever patients/AE crew are
   on board and the ambient temperature may exceed a comfortable level.
20.8. Refueling Operations.
   20.8.1. Concurrent servicing with patients onboard is not authorized.
20.9. Aircraft Configuration.

AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                  209


Ramp Spacer                                    9 pounds

      20.9.3.2. Each litter position is rated to hold 320 lbs. Each seat is rated to hold 260 lbs.
      20.9.3.3. The maximum total PSP weight will not exceed 2000 pounds. This includes
      the weight of the PSP. If weight limit is exceeded, supplemental restraint is required.
      Exceeding 2000 pounds requires an additional applied restraint to meet a minimum 9 G
      forward restraint capacity. Use T.O. 1C-135-9 when applying supplemental restraint.
      20.9.3.4. When possible, configure PSP seats facing aft.
   20.9.4. The PSP will be transported to the aircraft by aerial port personnel, positioned and
   secured on the aircraft by the BO and configured by the AE crew.
      20.9.4.1. Exercise caution when maneuvering the pallet in and around the aircraft.
   20.9.5. AECMs will configure the pallet. Boom operators should open the aircraft 3 hours
   prior to take off to facilitate AECM aircraft configuration. Boom operators will coordinate
   with the MCD if the aircraft will not be open 3 hours prior to takeoff. Loading the PSP and
   airline seats should be accomplished before entering crew rest. In cases when the KC-135 is
   configured at an en route stop, the MCD will coordinate with the PIC and BO, to determine
   when the aircraft should be configured for the next day’s mission. When possible, the aircraft
   should be configured the day prior to the mission. The MCD is responsible to ensure
   coordination between appropriate agencies has occurred or are in place to deliver PSPs to the
   aircraft.
   20.9.6. PSP configuration will be determined by patient requirements. Each seat has storage
   capacity for required pre-positioned AFE (EPOS and life preserver unit).
   20.9.7. PSP ramps, extenders and spacers should be used with PSPs to mitigate hazards
   created by uneven surfaces. Spacers are designed to cover the gaps between the PSPs.
   20.9.8. Once secured in the roller system, secure PSPs with a cargo tie-down strap to the
   roller system rails to prevent forward-aft pallet movement during flight.
   20.9.9. Floor Loading. Litter patients may be floor loaded using standard cargo tiedown
   straps to secure the litter to the floor. Shoring is required to prevent damage to the aircraft
   floor.
      20.9.9.1. Do not place litters in front of exits or on top of landing gear inspection
      window covers (marked in red, yellow, or black).
      20.9.9.2. Maximum floor loaded litter capacity is eight patients.
          20.9.9.2.1. Maximum ambulatory capacity depends on aircraft configuration.
   20.9.10. Configure seats IAW AFI 11-2AEV3, Addenda A. Aft facing stud mounted seats
   are the only approved seats for use on the KC-135.
      20.9.10.1. For AE-3 configurations install only four aft tandem seats (8-seats total) from
      Body Stations 860-920.
 210                                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


       20.9.10.2. Aircraft will depart home station with airline seats installed. Coordination is
       required when airline seats are located at the staging point. AECMs will ensure seats do
       not block emergency exits and will notify the BO if exits are blocked.
   20.9.11. Coordinate with the BO prior to securing excess AE equipment and in-flight kits.
       20.9.11.1. During preflight, the Charge Medical Technician (CMT) will provide the BO
       with equipment weights using AMC Checklist Insert Guide and provide weights per
       pallet.
   20.9.12. Pallet end stops protrude into egress paths. Remove forward and aft pallet end stops
   once PSPs are locked in place. The BO will reinstall pallet end stops prior to unlocking PSPs.
   20.9.13. Enplaning/Deplaning. Air stairs are the preferred method to enplane/deplane
   ambulatory patients. If litter patients are on board, use the High Deck Patient Loading
   Platform (HDPLP) or the Patient Loading System (PLS) to enplane/deplane all litter and
   ambulatory patients. Maximum PLS weight capacity is 1500 lbs. If the HDPLP or PLS is not
   available, request MHE support (Halverson Lift, Tunner, Hi-lift truck). Planning must take
   into consideration the limitation of MHE platforms, i.e., exposure to weather, loading time,
   loading considerations).
20.10. Passengers and Cargo.
   20.10.1. The PIC, with the concurrence of the MCD, will ensure maximum aircraft
   utilization for passengers. Passenger restrictions based upon patient considerations will be
   identified when seats are released. The PIC will advise the appropriate C2 agency of the
   factors limiting seat availability for passengers.
   20.10.2. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps, a 30-
   inch space will be maintained between the cargo and the nearest forward occupied litter or
   occupied seat. When cargo, either palletized or non-palletized, is secured with chains, the 30-
   inch spacing is not required.
   20.10.3. Maintain 30 inch spacing between all litters and cargo on Aeromedical Evacuation
   (AE) missions, when carrying occupied litters.
   20.10.4. Do not move ambulatory patients to litters in order to provide seating for additional
   patients or passengers.
   20.10.5. For patient comfort and to permit inflight rest for patients use the following for
   missions over 4 hours in duration:
       20.10.5.1. Minimum of 2 litters must be available for ambulatory patients.
       20.10.5.2. One seat must be reserved for every 3 litter patients.
   20.10.6. An emergency litter will be set up on all AE missions.
   20.10.7. Portable Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PT LOX) may be transported for positioning
   and de-positioning of Operational/contingency support AE Missions.
   20.10.8. A maximum of 25 PT LOX serviced units may be transported simultaneously
   without Hazmat certification. Processing through aerial port is not required. If shipping more
   than six PTLOX containers as cargo, do not cover the containers with plastic. This will
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                 211


   prevent potential accumulation of high oxygen concentration levels. WARNING: Ensure the
   cargo floor is free from any oil or petroleum products.
   20.10.9. Hazardous cargo will not normally be transported aboard AE missions.
   20.10.10. AE Movement of Contaminated/Contagious Personnel. It is United States
   Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) policy that patients personnel, or casualties
   with known or suspected contamination from chemical, biological, or nuclear warfare agents
   will not be transported within the aeromedical patient movement system. Decontamination
   must be performed prior to transport to prevent the potential spread of contamination. In rare
   cases, transport may be essential to preserve life or continue critical missions. If such
   transport is deemed essential, all efforts must be made to prevent the spread of
   contamination. In these cases, prior approval must be given by the involved geographic
   combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and the Secretary of Defense
   (SECDEF) in consultation with Department of Defense medical authorities.
      20.10.10.1. Patients with known or suspected or highly contagious disease will not be
      transported within the patient movement system. These include infections with any agent
      that may pose a potential threat to national security, require special public health actions,
      and/or have the potential to cause public panic and social disruption. Patients known or
      suspected to be infected with a highly contagious disease should be treated “in place” or
      with minimal transportation to medical authorities. In extreme circumstances there may
      be a requirement to move index cases (approximately two) for evaluation or critical
      medical care. If patient movement is required, prior approval must be given by the
      involved geographic combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and
      SECDEF in consultation with medical authorities.
      20.10.10.2. AMC will train and equip AE crews and stage required equipment at key
      hubs to carry out these limited missions for movement of contaminated and contagious
      patients. NOTE: If AECMs are utilizing the MCU-2A ground chemical mask, a FL
      below 10,000 feet is recommended due to reported valve failure during rapid
      decompression.
20.11. Crash/Fire/Rescue (CFR).
   20.11.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per T.O. 00-25-172.
   Stand- by CFR vehicle is not necessary during normal operations however, a CFR vehicle
   will be available upon request. The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
   20.11.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the controlling
   agency will coordinate CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR vehicle coverage
   may be denied. This will not prevent refueling operations from occurring.
   20.11.3. Do not use MHE or PLS during ground evacuations as they may interfere with
   CFR.
20.12. AE Call Sign/Use of Priority Clearance
   20.12.1. If a medical emergency occurs during flight, and is determined by the MCD to be
   an urgent situation, a request for AIR EVAC Priority will be requested. The PIC may request
   “AIR EVAC priority” for preferential ATC handling if a delay will affect a patient’s well-
   being. AIR EVAC priority will only be used for that portion of the flight requiring expedited
 212                                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   handling. Do not request priority for routine air evacuations to avoid ATC delays or
   inconveniences. It is the PIC’s responsibility to use this option only for bona fide medical
   situations that demand priority handling. Use this status judiciously.
       20.12.1.1. The PIC needs to consider cabin temperature control during preflight, taxi,
       and flight when determining the need to request AIREVAC priority handling throughout
       all phases of the mission.
20.13. Load Message.
   20.13.1. At military bases, the flight crew will pass inbound load messages to the proper
   command and control personnel. At civilian airfields, notify ground control.
20.14. ERO Procedures. Not authorized.
20.15. Floor Loading Procedures.
   20.15.1. Floor loading of litter patients is authorized for all contingency operations when a
   time critical environment exists (i.e. non-secure landing zones, areas faced with enemy
   siege/hostile fire, humanitarian reasons, etc.), and minimum ground time is essential. Floor
   loading procedures can be practiced/trained during aeromedical readiness missions (ARMs),
   joint training operations, exercises, etc. Maximum altitude for floor loaded litter patients is
   FL 350. Patients will have an EPOS pre-positioned on their litter when floor loaded. When
   floor loading litter patients is required, comply with the following.
       20.15.1.1. Ambulatory Patients. If available, any cushioning material may be used for
       seating, to prevent the patient from having to sit on the cargo floor. Seat ambulatory
       patients to face forward in the aircraft. Attach a cargo tie-down strap for each row of
       patients, in a manner that it will provide forward restraint and body stability.
       20.15.1.2. Patients are positioned with head toward the flight deck, longitudinally on the
       aircraft floor. Seats will need to be removed.
       20.15.1.3. Refer to AFI 11-2AE V3 Addenda A for additional floor loading litter
       procedures.
20.16. Aircraft Systems and Equipment.
   20.16.1. Electrical. The PSP does not have electrical provisions. Electrical power for 400 Hz
   medical equipment is provided by an approved KC-135, 400 Hz pigtail adaptor (P/N
   8564034-135) located in the Electrical Cord Assembly Set (ECAS). Electrical power for 60
   Hz medical equipment is provided by the portable Avionics or Unitron Frequency Converter
   using the Frequency Converter Adapter Adaptive Electrical Pigtail (P/N 8564034-140).
       20.16.1.1. Secure all ECAS connections with plastic tie-straps, including medical
       equipment plugs at the terminal end of the ECAS and AC electrical extension cord. To
       ensure stability of wires, secure the portion of the ECAS cord closest to the pigtail to a
       non-moving aircraft part.
          20.16.1.1.1. Plastic tie-straps should be 15 inches in length to adequately cover all
          circumferences.
          20.16.1.1.2. Use only “modified” Avionics Frequency Converters which are easily
          identified with a black on orange placard on the top of the unit with the statement:
AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                               213


          “Approved for Use in a Fuel Vapor Environment, Contract No. F41622-01-D-0001,
          DO 5010.”
      20.16.1.2. On KC-135R and T model aircraft, utilize the galley outlet receptacle or the
      three additional electrical outlets on the KC-135 R/T block 40 aircraft. Any or all of the
      outlets may be utilized on AE missions. However, do not exceed the 30 amp capability of
      the frequency converter at individual outlets. For AE missions, utilization of the Avionics
      or Unitron Frequency Converter and/or KC-135 ECAS adapter(s) is authorized.
      20.16.1.3. Not Used.
      20.16.1.4. Coordinate with BO for galley disconnect and pulling of circuit breakers
      before connecting the pigtail adaptor to the aircraft. When connecting the pigtail adaptor
      to the galley plugs, ensure both circuit breakers marked GALLEY PWR and Station 445
      are pulled. Home station maintenance group will lock out/tag all incompatible power
      receptacles and document on AFTO IMT 781A.
      20.16.1.5. Once the AECM has secured all electrical connections, coordinate with the
      BO to reset circuit breakers prior to powering on any medical equipment.
   20.16.2. Ensure equipment is turned-off before disconnecting any plugs from ECAS
   extension outlets in-flight.
   20.16.3. Emergency Oxygen for patients will be provided by Emergency Passenger Oxygen
   System (EPOS).
   20.16.4. Flight crews will ensure AFE is configured IAW AFI 11-2KC-135V3, Addenda A,
   for Channel Missions.
   20.16.5. AE Crew Oxygen: MA-1 portable oxygen bottles will provide AECMs emergency
   oxygen. AECMs need not preflight personal oxygen equipment on a pressure demand
   regulator if they are assigned an MA-1 portable oxygen bottle.
   20.16.6. The aircraft should be configured at home station with 5 extra MA-1 portable walk
   around bottles with harnesses (if available). In the event MA-1 walk-around bottles are not
   available and the preplanned flight level is below 350, a PBE will be used. If a PBE is not
   available and the Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS) is the only available source,
   the AECM will cease crew duties and be seated until the PIC has directed crew members to
   remove emergency oxygen.
   20.16.7. Latrine. The latrine capacity is limited. This should be taken into consideration for
   planning procedures. Aircraft will depart home station with an operable latrine and a
   minimum of two urine tubes and two latrine cartridges (see Table 13.3, Latrine Capacity vs.
   Personnel Loading chart). The CMT will verify the latrine is fully functional when uploading
   the PSP.
      20.16.7.1. AECMs should escort patients to the latrine. Same sex AECM will
      accompany mental health patients to the latrine to provide supervision.
20.17. Aerial Refueling (AAR).
   20.17.1. Aerial refueling may be required when patients are on board. Unplanned aircraft
   attitudes can take place during AAR, which can affect patient care. Prior to a planned AAR,
214                                                   AFI11-2KC-135V3 15 AUGUST 2013


  all patients should be screened by a validating flight surgeon to ensure they can tolerate
  AAR.
  20.17.2. All personnel will be seated with seat belts fastened during AAR. If urgent patient
  care is necessary, AECMs may stand to resolve the situation.
  20.17.3. Practice emergency separations are prohibited on AE missions while patients are
  on-board.

Over water Flight—Any flight that exceeds power off gliding distance from land.
Patient Movement Categories:—Urgent—Patients who must be moved immediately to save
life, limb, or eyesight, or to prevent complication of a serious illness.
Priority—Patients requiring prompt medical care that must be moved within 24 hours.
Routine—Patients who should be picked up within 72 hours and moved on routine/scheduled
flights.
Permit to Proceed—Aircraft not cleared at the first US port of entry may move to another US
airport on a permit to proceed issued by customs officials at the first port of entry. This permit
lists the requirements to be met at the next point of landing, i.e. number of crew and passengers,
cargo not yet cleared. PIC are responsible to deliver the permit to proceed to the customs
inspector at the base where final clearance is performed. (Heavy monetary fines can be imposed
on the PIC for not complying with permit to proceed procedures.)
Point Of No Return—Most distant point along the planned route from which an aircraft may
safely return to its point of departure or alternate airport with approach and landing fuel.
Point of Safe Return—Most distant point along the planned route from which an aircraft may
safely return to its point of departure or alternate airport with required fuel reserve.

Positioning and De-positioning Missions—Positioning missions are performed to relocate
aircraft for the purpose of conducting a mission. De-positioning missions are made to return
aircraft from bases at which missions have terminated.
Quick Stop—Set of procedures designed to expedite the movement of selected missions by
reducing ground times at en route or turnaround stations.
Ramp Coordinator—Designated representative of the C2 center whose primary duty is the
coordination of ground handling activities on the ramp during large-scale operations.
Readiness Spares Package (RSP)—An air deployable package of selected spares to support a
specific mission, operation, or aircraft model design series (MDS).
Scheduled Return Date (SRD)—Scheduling tool used by units to predict when crews will
return to home station. It allows force managers to plan aircrew availability and provide crews
visibility over monthly flying activities. AMC and AMC-gained aircrews (except those on
standby at home station) will have an SRD established on their flight orders.
Scheduled Takeoff Time—Takeoff time is established in the schedule or OPORD. For air
aborts and diversions, this will be engine shut down time (or arrival in the blocks if engine
shutdown is not scheduled) plus authorized ground time. Early deviation does not apply to aborts
or diversions unless the mission is formally rescheduled by current operations. Scheduled takeoff
time may be adjusted to make good an ARCT. Notify controlling agency prior to takeoff to
adjust the scheduled takeoff time.
Section—Subdivision of a formation. A section normally consists of 6 aircraft (2 elements).
Serial—Normally consists of 12 aircraft (2 sections or 4 elements).
Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET)—Area weather advisory issued by an
ICAO meteorological office relayed to and broadcast by the applicable ATC agency. SIGMET
advisories are issued for tornadoes, lines of thunderstorms, embedded thunderstorms, large hail,
severe and extreme turbulence, severe icing, and widespread dust or sand storms. SIGMETs
frequently cover a large geographical area and vertical thickness. They are prepared for general
aviation and may not consider aircraft type or capability.
Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM)—Funded airlift that cannot be supported by
channel missions because of the unusual nature, sensitivity, or urgency of the cargo or that
requires operations to points other than the established channel structure.
Special Tactics Team (STT)—Team of Air Force personnel organized, trained, and equipped to
establish and operate navigational or terminal guidance aids, communications, and aircraft
control facilities in support of combat aerial delivery operations.
Stations Time (Air Force)—Normally, 30 minutes prior to takeoff time for the KC-10, KC-135,
C-130, C-141, and OSA aircraft (45 minutes for C-5 and C-17). Aircrews will have completed
their preflight. duties and be at their crew positions. Passengers will be seated and cargo will be
secured.
618 Air Operations Center Tanker Airlift Control Center (618 AOC (TACC))—Operations
center that controls tanker and airlift forces worldwide through a network of computer systems.
The 618 AOC (TACC) is organized into Contingency Airlift, SAAM/Channel Airlift, and
Tanker Cells. The 618 AOC (TACC) contains the following functions: Mobility Management,

Global Channel Operations, Operations Management, Current Operations, Global Readiness,
Weather, Logistics Readiness Center, Aerial Port Control Center, International Clearances, and
Flight Plans.
Tactical Event—Tactical Approaches/Departures and Formation Tactics (i.e. tanker formation
operations in a threat environment where defensive maneuvers might be employed).
Tanker Task Force (TTF)—Force of tanker aircraft assembled and tasked to perform a specific
function.
Theater Patient Movement Requirements Center (TPMRC)—The TPMRC is responsible for
theater wide patient movement (e.g., medical regulating and AE scheduling), and coordinates
with theater MTFs to allocate the proper treatment of assets required to support its role. The
primary role of the TPMRC is to devise theater plans and schedules and then monitor their
execution in concert with the GPMRC. The TPMRC is responsible to the Combatant
Commander through the Combatant Command Surgeon. The TPMRC is also responsible for all
aspect of intratheater patient movement management. A TPMRC provides command and control
for patient movement management operations in its theater of operations, as directed by its
Combatant Commander’s operational policy, and in coordination with USTRANSCOM, acting
as a supporting combatant command, responsible for intertheater and CONUS patient movement.
Time Out—Common assertive statement used to voice crewmember concern when safety may
be jeopardized.
Training Mission—Mission executed at the unit level for the sole purpose of aircrew training
for upgrade or proficiency. Does not include operational missions as defined in this AFI.
Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)—Formerly known as Defense Business
Operations Fund-Transportation (DBOF-T). Part of the Air Force Working Capital Fund
(AFWCF). Normally used to cover costs that can be recovered from customers. Examples
include TDY costs, or airlift unit deployment bed down locations, airlift unit level mission
planning expenses, and support or contract costs for deployed TWCF units/personnel.
Unilateral—Operations confined to a single service.
Unit Move—A mission airlifting military passengers or troops who originate from the same unit
