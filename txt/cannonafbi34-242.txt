     same hotel.
     1.18.2.7. Give arrival times, number of personnel, length of stay, and number of rooms
     required to the hotel when making reservations. The provisions of AFI 34-246 apply two

       people per room, with separate rooms for the chaplain and officers. Remember that an
       odd number of females will require an extra room. The OIC/NCOIC will take a wind up
       alarm clock to ensure prompt arrival.
       1.18.2.8. Members should wear civilian clothes on the trip so their uniforms will be fresh
       for the funeral. The OIC/NCOIC assembles and carries Honor Guard clothing such as
       scarves, belt, etc., in a bag.
       1.18.2.9. The contracted bugler may bill the 27 SOFSS directly. The 27 SOFSS RC/CC a

1.22. Honor Guard Performances.
   1.22.1. Cannon AFB is often asked to provide a color guard or other element of the Honor
   Guard at various civic functions and parades. Other base agencies also request the team’s
   help in arranging changes of command, opening ceremonies, etc.
   1.22.2. Every effort will be made to accommodate these requests; with the understanding
   that funeral honors will always take precedence over even a firm arrangement.
   1.22.3. Arrangements in support of functions other than funerals will be made in the same
   way as for funeral honors. TDYs are permissible in support of these functions.
   1.22.4. Ensure team members are not over-tasked or used excessively outside their duty
   sections. This may deteriorate supervisory support of the program and be discouraging to the
   team members as well.

                       SEARCH AND RECOVERY PROCEDURES

5.1. General Information. A S&R operation is a delicate, disciplined task which has a great
impact on the mental and emotional well being of the victims’ families, PADD, and on the
reputation of the Air Force. A tragedy involving the death of military members must not be
compounded by incomplete or inadequate efforts to fully recover all remains and make accurate
individual identification.
   5.1.1. Upon notification of an accident (real world or exercise), all team members will
   immediately be called and put on stand-by. After the MO has responded to the entry control
   point (ECP) or accident site as applicable, the MO will determine how many team members
   are needed for search and recovery.
   5.1.2. The following code words will be used if communications between ECP and base are
   subject to civilian intercept:
       5.1.2.1. Condition Blue: No fatalities.
       5.1.2.2. Condition Green: 1-3 fatalities or small search area less than ¼ mile search area,
       with limited search and recovery needed. Send an 8-member team.
       5.1.2.3. Condition Yellow: 3-4 fatalities or a medium size search area, less than 1 ½
       square miles, with limited search and recovery needed. Send entire 11-member team.
       5.1.2.4. Condition Red: 5 or more fatalities, extensive dismemberment, or a search area
       greater than 1 ½ miles. AFMAO will take charge of situation and arrive at the location
       within 24hrs. 11-member team will be on stand-by to assist AFMAO.
   5.1.3. Once the team size has been determined, the members will be recalled to the 27
   SOFSS headquarters inside the Readiness and Plans Office (Building 600 Room 2026) three
   hours before the estimated time that the S&R can begin. Personnel will sign in as they arrive.
   5.1.4. An appropriate readiness office member will start a log of events. The MO will also
   keep a separate, detailed log of all actions taken, persons contacted, dates and times, etc.
   5.1.5. Members will be briefed on the nature of the accident, expected conditions of the
   remains, health hazards in terms of fallout, chemical contamination, explosives, terrain, etc.,
   by the MO.
   5.1.6. Members’ units will issue additional clothing items if needed.
   5.1.7. Team members will be transported in the aforementioned bus from 27 SOLRS, and
   the S&R team equipment will be transported in the S&R trailer or other vehicle.
   5.1.8. Team leaders will order ground support meals for S&R members, as required, through
   the food service representative.
   5.1.9. The incident commander or accident investigation board gives the authority to begin
   S&R operations.
       5.1.9.1. Members will proceed IAW AFI 34-242.
 24                                                CANNONAFBI34-242 30 OCTOBER 2012


       5.1.9.2. Only S&R team members will be permitted to tag or remove remains. Three tags
       will be used for all positions—one on the remains, one on the stake, and one on the
       recovery bag.
       5.1.9.3. The extent of the search area is determined upon consultation with the incident
       commander, disaster control group members, aerial photographs/sketches, and discovery
       of outlying wreckage. The search should extend considerably beyond the furthest piece of
       wreckage recovered.
       5.1.9.4. Remains will be refrigerated as soon as possible. If food service refrigerated
       truck is not immediately available or adequate for the extent of the recovery operation,
       contact contracting to procure adequate refrigeration trucks (arrange a Blank Purchase
       Agreement, BPA, with refrigerated truck services ahead of time). Ice chests or ice packs
       may be used, as needed. Do not place ice in direct contact with the remains or on the
       face. If circumstances warrant, the Automotive Skills Center/Hobby Shop, will be used
       for identification processing due to the necessity of security, privacy, running water, and
       electricity. Remains will be stored at Cannon Air Force Base or the medical examiners,
       Albuquerque office, or within local mortuaries as described in the Mortuary MOU.
       5.1.9.5. The S&R for remains should not be discontinued until all salvage operations are
       complete. Portions of remains are likely to be adhered to or concealed by aircraft (or
       other equivalent parts) located in isolated areas. The incident commander will determine
       when S&R is officially completed.
5.2. Identification of Remains.
   5.2.1. IAW S&R procedures, all remains and personal belongings will be individually

MEMORANDUM FOR XXXXXXX

FROM: 27 SOFSS/FSOXU

SUBJECT: Summary Court Officer Briefing

1. You have been appointed Summary Court Officer (SCO) to dispose of the personal property
of XXX XXXXXX, active duty, deceased. Please read the attached Summary Court Package in
its entirety and read AFI 34-244, Disposition of Personal Property, before you take any action.
The instruction suggests the Staff Judge Advocate give guidance and assistance for legal matters.
However, the Mortuary Officer should be present during any legal consultation concerning your
court case.

2. As SCO, you are acting directly for the Wing Commander in everything you accomplish. At
all times the decedent’s next-of-kin (NOK) and their desires should be your foremost concern.
You should never do, say, or send anything, which could upset, distress, or humiliate the NOK.
Your job will require a great deal of tact, sympathy, and sound professional judgment. It will be
the most important additional duty you will execute in your military career. Your Summary
Court duties will require nearly all of your time, continually for about one or two weeks. You
should coordinate with your supervisor/commander to assure that you will not have any
additional duties or work which will interfere with your Summary Court duties.

3. You will be provided with a copy of AFI 34-244, which is your primary instruction for
disposition of the decedent’s property. This instruction by no means encompasses all the
situations, conditions, or other actions that may have to be taken in the disposition of property.
Therefore, do not hesitate to consult with the Base Legal Office in conjunction with the Mortuary
Officer or Mortuary Specialist for necessary guidance and assistance. Also, make sure you
always keep the Person Eligible to Receive Effects, (PERE), informed on your actions and
progress in forwarding the property to the PERE. Never attempt to answer questions about
entitlements, VA benefits, etc. Refer these matters to Casualty Affairs and the Legal Office.
You will not be required to expend any of your own money in the settlement of the decedent’s
property. Consult with the Mortuary Officer, Casualty Assistance Representative or Legal
Officer if needed.

4. Request you furnish 27 SOFSS/FSOXU, DSN 681-2964/7695 with a written or oral status
report weekly on progress until the case is closed. When you are finished with the case, you
must turn in a completed report. The report must be typed, indexed and placed in a folder. The
completed report will include copies of all letters, documents, forms, checklist, logs, and the case
summary.

5. The Summary Court Checklist is provided as a guideline for you to follow but it must be
emphasized that the checklist is only a general guide meant to assist you. Please do not hesitate

Dear Mrs. Doe,

   First may I convey to you and your family my deepest sympathy in the loss of your loved one.

James R. Unknown and I have been appointed Summary Courts Officer for your son’s estate. I
am responsible for safeguarding all of the personal property and for settling all financial matters
here in the local area.

car, it may be shipped at government expense. If you wish the car to be sold locally, I would
need a General Power of Attorney to make the necessary arrangements. Additionally, I will keep
you informed of the status of financial settlements as they are accomplished.
My mailing address is: Capt. James R. Unknown

   Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions, concerns, or problems you may have
concerning your son/daughter’s estate. I will give you any assistance that I can. I will be in
touch with you again soon.

(Appropriate Letterhead)

MEMORANDUM FOR ESCORT’S NAME

FROM: 27 SOFSS/FSOXU

SUBJECT: Instructions for Escort of Deceased Military Personnel

1. You have been selected as a military escort for the purpose of accompanying the late
(insert name). Only the highest caliber of personnel is selected to perform escort duty. It is an
honor for you to be chosen to express the Nation’s gratitude to its honored deceased. You are,
therefore, advised that your selection and assignment as a military escort places a great deal of
responsibility upon you as a member of the Armed Forces.

2. It is desired to emphasize the importance of this assignment; particularly in maintaining your
dress and appearance, sobriety, and certain acceptable intangibles which will preclude the
possibility of any criticism being levied against you as an individual or against the Armed
Forces. Needless to say, the duty of an escort is of a sensitive nature. One slip in your actions,
or a misplaced word or gesture made unwittingly or knowingly, can cause irreparable damage
never to be overcome by any subsequent will-meaning words or gesture.

3. Tact, sympathetic understanding, common sense and diplomacy are most essential in the
assignment. Remember that you are representing the Armed Forces of the United States and the
Department of Defense. Because of your position of responsibility, you will be looked upon as a
model representative of the Armed Forces.

4. GENERAL INFORMATION:

   a. The Mortuary Officer will make arrangements for you and remains to be at the common
   carrier in ample time to meet your schedule.

   b. The receiving funeral director will be notified by this office, by telephone, fax or e-mail of
   the time the remains will arrive at your final destination. Receiving funeral director will be
   requested to meet you with transportation for the remains. You will be authorized a rental
   car at destination. When funeral director picks up remains, follow hearse with rental car. At
   time of notification by the Mortuary Officer, the funeral director is requested to notify the
   Person Authorized to Direct Disposition (PADD) of arrival schedule.

   c. The head envelope, which will be attached to the shipping case of the deceased, will
   contain the burial transit permit. (This permit is intended for the receiving funeral director.)
   If a wooden shipping case is used, this envelope will be fastened at the head end. If an air
   tray is
   used, this envelope will be taped to the head end. If transportation is by land hearse and no

  If remains are being transported in a hearse, the shipping case will be draped with a flag. The
  casket and air tray are not draped during the delivery to the airport air freight. The casket or
  air tray is draped on the removal from the airport to the funeral home.

  g. DO NOT BECOME SEPARTATED FROM THE REMAINS WHICH YOU ARE
  ESCORTING. Be particularly cautious when transfer is necessary.

  h. Upon arrival at destination airport and prior to the departure by hearse to funeral home,

     (1) When the flag is used to drape a half-couch casket (Viewable Remains), it should be
     placed in three layers (10-inch folds) to cover the closed half of the casket with the union
     (blue field) on the deceased’s left.

       (2) When the flag is used to drape a closed casket (Non-Viewable Remains), it should be
       placed so that the union (blue field) is at the head and over the left shoulder of the
       deceased.

   j. As the escort, and unless otherwise instructed by the PADD, you are allowed to attend the
   funeral service.

   k. If the NOK has expressed a desire for military honors, this office will request the
   Commander of the nearest base to your final destination to furnish necessary personnel.

5. DEBRIEFING. Upon return to station, report to the Base Mortuary Officer within two days of
your return for debriefing. At this time provide AF Form 1947, Escort Report. The report

   c. Personally check to see that the remains you are escorting are placed aboard common
   carrier.

   d. Board common carrier being used and occupy seat after remains are placed on board.

   e. Personally accompany remains if transferred en route. Stay with the remains until they are

   important person in the world to their surviving loved ones.

                         OFF BASE AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY

This map illustrates the off-base area of responsibility (AOR) for Cannon AFB’s response to
major accidents involving DoD resources. It reflects the area defined in AFI 32-4001 for major
accident response that requires the installation nearest the scene of a major accident involving
DoD resources respond to the accident. Conditions may dictate response outside the defined
AOR.
