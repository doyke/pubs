          1.2.4.1.1. Minimum attendee representation is all group commanders, directors,
          commanders of units with maintenance personnel, safety, CES, Airfield Manager, and
          security forces. Associate units will be part of the host program and will not establish
          an independent FOD program. Tenant units should establish their own unit FOD
          committee, but will still participate in the host program and comply with host
          program requirements. The FOD meeting may be combined with other meetings.
      1.2.4.2. The Unit FOD Monitor will attend FOD meetings and assist the FOD Program
      Manager in corrective actions needed to prevent recurrences of FOD mishaps.
      1.2.4.3. Units will ensure all personnel receive initial and annual refresher FOD
      awareness training. MXG personnel will receive initial training through Maintenance
      Qualification Training Program (MQTP) Phase I. Recurring training (annual) and initial
      (for those who do not attend MQTP) will be provided through the unit training program
      monitor. Training will be tracked in Maintenance Information Systems (MIS) for MXG
      personnel. All other units will use an AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and
      Recurring Training, or automated training program.
      1.2.4.4. Units will conduct weekly FOD walks within their areas of responsibility (AOR)
      (Attachment 3) on the first duty day of each week prior to the start of the flying period,
      and will conduct additional FOD walks as required to ensure safe operations. The only
      acceptable changes for the date a FOD walk is performed are environmental hazards,
      weather, mission requirements, and seasonal hours of darkness. If a squadron cancels
      due to any of these issues, the FOD walk will be accomplished on the next acceptable
      duty day. In the event the FOD walk is cancelled, the Squadron FOD Monitor will notify
      the Maintenance Operation Center (MOC), the appropriate unit Flight Safety Officer, and
      the 6 AMW FOD/DOPP Monitor with a rescheduled date/time.
      1.2.4.5. FOD walks will be accomplished in the following manner: Personnel will line
      up side-by-side with appropriate spacing and perform a sweeping pass of their respected
      AOR. This may take several passes depending on the amount of people and the size of
      the AOR to be walked.
      1.2.4.6. MXG personnel will perform a FO checks of their work area after the
      completion of any maintenance. In addition, personnel will be constantly alert for any
      form of FO during all phases of maintenance and ensure work areas are continually
      policed to eliminate FO.
1.3. FOD Reporting Procedures. The following will be accomplished upon discovery of any
actual or suspected FOD mishap:
   1.3.1. Incidents (tire, engine, and blade blending) will be reported to the Production
   Superintendent on duty.

 12                                                   MACDILLAFBI21-108 23 APRIL 2013


2.4. Procedures.
   2.4.1. The DOPP inspection checklist items in T.O. 1C-135-6WC-1 are used to facilitate
   thorough inspections and prevent dropped objects. DOPP inspections are to be performed in
   conjunction with all Preflight, Thruflight and Quick-turn inspections.
       2.4.1.1. Complete all inspection requirements when performing the DOPP inspection in
       conjunction with a Preflight or Thruflight inspection.
       2.4.1.2. When performing the DOPP inspection in conjunction with a Quick-turn
       inspection, do only those inspection requirements identified in T.O. 1C-135-6WC-1with
       a dollar sign ($) and bold text. These workcards list items are common to all KC-135
       aircraft. Some equipment may or may not be installed based on specific aircraft
       configuration and mission requirements.
          2.4.1.2.1. This inspection is intended to be a visual inspection accomplished from the
          ground unless otherwise noted. There is no requirement to use a ladder or stand
          unless a discrepancy is suspected that requires closer inspection.
          2.4.1.2.2. Inspection methodology of look, touch, tap and feel applies and should be
          used to ensure security of all items identified.
          2.4.1.2.3. DOPP inspection items are items all technicians are required to understand
          and inspect in order to be qualified on and perform proper Preflight, Thruflight,
          Quick-turn, Hourly Post Flight and all flightline T.O. 1C-135-6WC-1 inspections.
          No separate 7-level follow-up is required. AFTO Form 781H certification of these
          inspections constitutes signed accomplishment of DOPP inspections as mandated
          above. No separate inspection entry is required in the AFTO Form 781A. As with
          any inspection, if any portion of the inspection is unable to be completed, annotate the
          unfinished portion of the inspection (state reason, date/time) on a red dash in the
          AFTO Form 781A per T.O. 00-20-1.
   2.4.2. Periodic Inspection.
       2.4.2.1. Each aircraft panel/door that remains open when the aircraft leaves the
       inspection dock will be placed on a separate Red “X” entry in the aircraft AFTO Form
       781A and/or automated forms (G081/MIS).
2.5. Investigation
   2.5.1. The DOPP monitor will investigate each dropped object incident. Every effort will be
   made to determine the precise cause to ensure positive corrective action is accomplished.
   Anytime a materiel or design deficiency is the cause, or suspected cause, a deficiency report
   (DR) will be submitted in accordance with TO 00-35D-54, even when an exhibit is not
   available. Investigation results will be distributed to each appropriate work center for
   inclusion in personnel training and education programs.
2.6. DOPP Reporting Procedures. The following will be accomplished upon discovery of a
dropped object in accordance with AFI 21-101 and AFI 21-101_AMCSUP_I:
