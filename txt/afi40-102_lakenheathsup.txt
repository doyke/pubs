                                          TOBACCO USE

2.1. The Air Force is committed to providing an environment that does not encourage or
facilitate initiation or continued use of tobacco. The Air Force discourages the use of all
tobacco products. Tobacco use damages personal health and detracts from unit mission
readiness. Tobacco use by Airmen reflects poorly on professional image/appearance. Tobacco
includes, but is not limited to, cigars, cigarettes, electronic-cigarettes (“e-cigarettes”), stem pipes,
water pipes, hookahs, and smokeless products that are chewed, dipped, or sniffed.
2.2. Tobacco use is prohibited on AF installations, except in DTAs and housing units see
2.2.5.3.1. and 2.2.5.3.2.
   2.2.1. All installation entry gates will have signs indicating “Tobacco use is prohibited on
   this installation, except in Designated Tobacco Areas.”
   2.2.2. Tobacco-free MTF campuses. (Note: For purposes of this AFI, references to tobacco-
   free MTF campus include ANG MDG.)
       2.2.2.1. MTF campuses shall be tobacco-free. Tobacco-free environments minimize the
       health risks of STS, assist tobacco cessation efforts, and promote a culture of health and
       wellness.
       2.2.2.2. For the purposes of this Instruction, MTF is defined as a clinic or hospital
       established for the primary purpose of furnishing medical or dental care for DoD-eligible
       beneficiaries.
       2.2.2.3. MTF campuses are defined as the contiguous area surrounding the clinic or
       hospital, to include parking structures and lots; lawns; and other outdoor areas contiguous
       with the MTF. MTF campus boundaries are determined in accordance with paragraph
       2.2.3.4 below.
       2.2.2.4. Installations with multiple geographically separated hospital buildings and
       clinics may have multiple MTF campuses as determined by the base CE in paragraph
       2.2.3.4 below.
       2.2.2.5. MTF campus boundaries are determined by CE, with coordination by the
       MDG/CC and approval of the Installation Commander.
       2.2.2.6. MTF campus boundary for primary MTF.
           2.2.2.6.1. The primary MTF is the MTF on the installation that has the
           preponderance of patient care services, as determined by the MDG/CC.
           2.2.2.6.2. If no part of the primary MTF campus boundary is within 250 feet of the
           primary MTF, CE, with coordination by the MDG/CC and approval of the Installation
           Commander, may re-define one portion of the primary MTF campus boundary.
               2.2.2.6.2.1. The re-defined boundary shall be no less than 200 feet and no greater
               than 250 feet from the primary MTF structure.
               2.2.2.6.2.2. The re-defined boundary permits placement of a DTA outside of the
               MTF campus that minimizes extended or possibly dangerous travel by staff and
8                                            AFI40-102_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 2 MAY 2014


              visitors who use tobacco. This DTA, where practical, should be located in an area
              that minimizes visibility, especially to children, and minimizes risk of exposure to
              STS.
       2.2.2.7. The use of NRT is allowed in a tobacco-free environment.
       2.2.2.8. MTFs will have 18 months from publication of this AFI to fully implement
       tobacco-free MTF campuses.
       2.2.2.9. Joint Bases.
           2.2.2.9.1. In joint bases where the AF is the Supporting Component, the tobacco-free
           MTF policy will apply to all MTFs on the joint base installation unless specifically
           listed as an exception under an existing joint base agreement IAW Department of
           Defense Initial Guidance for Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005 Joint
           Basing Implementation (22 Jan 08).
           2.2.2.9.2. In joint bases where the AF is the Supported Component, the tobacco-free
           MTF policy will apply to MTFs on the joint base installation upon approval of the
           Joint Base Installation Commander. Disapprovals to apply the tobacco-free MTF
           policy to AF MTFs on a joint base installation should be documented in writing in the
           joint base agreement.
    2.2.3. Designation of DTAs.
    2.2.3. (LAKENHEATH) Permitted tobacco use areas at RAF Lakenheath and RAF
    Feltwell are shown in the maps at Attachment 2. These high-fidelity maps can be viewed in
    expanded settings to depict an exact location and/or descriptive information.
       2.2.3.1. Base CE will determine DTAs with input from facility managers and squadron
       commanders.
       2.2.3.2. DTA maps for the installation will be coordinated with the MDG/CC prior to
       approval by the Installation Commander.
       2.2.3.3. Facility managers may share DTAs to prevent excessive and duplicative
       designation of tobacco use areas.
       2.2.3.4. Base CE determines boundaries of the MTF campus and coordinates boundaries
       and DTA maps with MDG/CC prior to submission to Installation Commander for
       approval.
    2.2.4. Standards for DTAs.
       2.2.4.1. DTAs will be kept in good condition reflecting their surroundings.
       2.2.4.2. Tobacco use on the installation shall be restricted to DTAs. Tobacco use outside
       of DTAs, including while walking anytime outside of DTAs, is prohibited.
       2.2.4.3. DTAs shall be away from common points of facility entry/egress and not in front
       of buildings or air intake ducts. The distance of a DTA from building entry/egress is to be
       determined by the squadron commander but will be no less than 50 feet.
           2.2.4.3.1. DTAs shall be a minimum of 50 feet from pedestrian walkways, to include
           parking lots, to prevent secondhand smoke exposure to passersby.

         2.2.4.3.2. No DTA shall be within 100 feet of playgrounds to minimize the health
         risks of STS to children playing, entering or exiting the area.
         2.2.4.3.3. Deviations from these distances are authorized if structural limitations exist
         and only upon approval of the Installation Commander.
     2.2.4.4. DTAs will be annotated on an installation map and marked with signs:
     “Designated Tobacco Area.” With the exception of housing units (see 2.2.5.3.1 and
     2.2.5.3.2), cigarette butt cans and receptacles are only located in the DTAs.
     2.2.4.5. Tobacco users are responsible for keeping DTAs clean and free of cigarette butts
     and debris. Commanders may remove DTAs if the area around it or leading up to it is

         non-smoking in order to minimize the health risks from tobacco use and STS, and
         promote a culture of health and wellness. If UH facilities are designated as non-
         smoking, smoking shall occur outside the facility in a DTA.
         2.2.5.3.2. Government-owned, -leased, and –managed family housing facilities will
         be designated smoke-free where there is a common air-handling unit for multiple
         individuals or families (i.e., stairwell housing, duplex). For family housing units with
         separate air-handling units, if STS seeps from a smoking unit to a non-smoking unit,
         the Installation Commander is authorized to designate the involved units as smoke-
         free, but other forms of tobacco not including smoking would continue to be
         permitted.

to secondhand smoke increases risk for heart disease, lung cancer, asthma, respiratory problems,
ear infections, and sudden infant death syndrome. There is no risk-free level of contact with
secondhand smoke.
Social Market Campaigns—process for influencing human behavior on a large scale, using
marketing principles for the purpose of societal benefit rather than commercial profit.
Tobacco—an agricultural product processed from the fresh leaves of plants in the genus
Nicotiana. Commercially available in dried, cured, and natural forms, it is often smoked in the
form of a cigar or cigarette, or in a stem pipe, water pipe, or hookah. Tobacco can also be
chewed, "dipped" (placed between the cheek and gum), or sniffed into the nose as finely
powdered snuff.
Tobacco Cessation—the effort to successfully stop using tobacco products.
Tobacco Prevention—preventing tobacco abuse through the reduction or abatement of risk
