OFFUTTAFBI10-221 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                           3



1. INSTALLATION COMMAND AND CONTROL (IC2)
  1.1. General. The Installation Command and Control (IC2) structure provides the 55
  WG/CC with the construct to provide timely, continuous, and accurate direction to the wing
  in support of contingency and conventional operations, emergencies, increased readiness
  operations, and exercises and evaluations of the wing's capabilities.
     1.1.1. The IC2 construct provides the home station commander and air expeditionary
     wing or air expeditionary group with a C2 capability through which to command the full
     range of installation activities. These activities include processing/responding to
     Emergency Action Messages (EAM), emergency/disaster response and recovery,
     protecting the force, and providing Defense Support of Civilian Authority (DSCA) IAW
     AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management Programs, Planning, and Operations.
     1.1.2. The IC2 structure is used as a tool by the 55 WG/CC to execute efficient and
     predictable C2 of assigned forces. This OAFBI does not override specific regulatory
     requirements, but serves as a framework through which the wing’s distinct C2 nodes
     come together, through co- location or virtual integration, to affect efficiencies in
     information flow and capabilities.
  1.2. Installation Command and Control (IC2) Construct.
     1.2.1. The 55 WG/CC ensures the IC2 construct is organized to ensure support for any
     level of effort required to meet assigned taskings.
     1.2.2. The IC2 construct is comprised of C2 nodes from the CAT and 55th Wing
     Operations, Maintenance, Communication, Medical, and Mission Support Groups, as
     well as staff agencies and tenant units that support the 55 WG/CC’s Senior Staff. 55
     WG/CC’s support structure is collectively known as the Installation Control Center (ICC)
     and includes the Senior Staff, CAT, and CAT/ICC Staff (CAT Director and
     Coordinators).
     1.2.3. Prior to collocating IC2 nodes, a detailed risk analysis must be conducted. It is
     presumed that the risk of physical consolidation is high and consolidation via ―vir tual
     integration,‖ emphasizing the communications processes and capabilities required to
     effectively execute IC2, is the preferred option.
     1.2.4. To fully exploit the capabilities of the IC2 construct, the 55 WG/CC integrates
     functions and C2 elements into the IC2 construct. This integration may be achieved
     through physical collocation or ―virtual integration‖ via the Theater Battle Management
     Core System (TBMCS) (NIPRnet and SIPRnet), telephonic, and other digital means. All
     IC2 nodes will utilize TBMCS.
     1.2.5. The 55th WG/CC’s Senior Staff, CAT, and ICC staff provide the 55 WG/CC with
     personnel knowledgeable in all phases of the wing mission and assembles in the 55th
     Wing Command Post (CP), when notified, to direct and monitor essential wing functions.
     When directed, all members (see Attachment 2), designated alternates, and designated
     individuals must maintain immediate telephone/radio recall capability and keep the CP
     informed of their location.

            1.2.5.1. The ICC directs and monitors the utilization of wing resources; both materiel
            and personnel.
            1.2.5.2. 55 WG/XP will ensure ICC checklists are standardized to promote
            coordinated actions while mitigating redundant actions/notifications.
            1.2.5.3. The CAT delivers key information from the wing staff, group, squadron, and
            tenant organizations to other echelons, through C2 systems.
        1.2.6. ICC and CAT training is normally conducted each month. 55 WG/XP is the OPR
        for this training. The ICC/CAT Director, henceforth referred to as CAT Director (CAT-
        D), will determine the training content and assign responsibility for conducting the
        training to mission area experts. All Senior Staff, CAT, and ICC/CAT staff, henceforth
        referred to as CAT Staff, must attend this training.
        1.2.7. TBMCS applications will be utilized by all of the following work centers:
        Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), Command Post (CP), Emergency
        Communications Center (ECC), Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Airfield
        Operations, Weather, Vehicle Operations (VOPS), Communications Focal Point (CFP),
        Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE), Petroleum, Oil, Lubrication (POL), Group Control
        Centers (GCC), and Unit Control Centers (UCC).
1.2.8. This instruction addresses wing ICC and CAT procedures. It does not encompass every
OPLAN or contingency event. Refer to unit and base support plans the Installation Deployment
Plan (IDP) for additional required actions and responsibilities. Refer to 55th Wing Base X Plan
for Operational Readiness Evaluation (ORE) Phase 2 operations.
        1.2.9. Forms. Formats and general purpose forms referred to in this instruction will be
        prepared individually as required


2. CRISIS ACTION TEAM (CAT)
     2.1. General. Effective C2 is a basic requirement for conducting successful military
     missions and service functions. A functional organization that is coherent and recognizable
     is an essential enabler for rapid and effective application of C2. This C2 organization is
     scalable to account for varying missions and operating environments, and structured to
     facilitate operational familiarity. The CAT provides the 55 WG/CC with the C2 capability to
     monitor, assess, plan, and execute the full range of installation activities. The wing C2
     structure is comprised of the CP, ECC, CAT, EOC, and Group or Unit Control Centers
     (G/UCC) when activated, and referred to as nodes. IC2 is a collaborative effort between all
     of the nodes.
     2.2. Mission. The CAT, through the C2 nodes, provides teams of functional experts to focus
     on installation activities which include, but are not limited to:
        2.2.1. Receive, validate, process, and respond to Emergency Action Messages (EAM),
        missile warnings, and North American Air Defense (NORAD) alerts, as applicable.
        2.2.2. Schedule, task, execute, monitor, track, and report day-to-day tasked air operations
        and the daily flying schedule.
OFFUTTAFBI10-221 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                             5


     2.2.3. Conduct wing recall to support operational requirements, emergency response,
     meet contingency/OPLAN requirements, and local and HHQ’s directed exercises.
     2.2.4. Coordinate maintenance operations and mission generation.
     2.2.5. Process Warning/Alert/Execution/Planning/Deployment Orders.
     2.2.6. Monitor and report on personnel readiness and manpower.
     2.2.7. Monitor aircraft maintenance status and load updates.
     2.2.8. Provide C2 for Emergency Management Program activities related to emergency
     preparedness, passive defense, incident management (including emergency/disaster
     response and recovery operations) and consequence management.
     2.2.9. Issue base control procedures, alarm conditions, and coordinate base survivability
     operations.
     2.2.10. Provide Defense Support of Civilian Authority (DSCA).
     2.2.11. Coordinate mission support functions (e.g., supply, transportation, and logistics
     planning).
     2.2.12. Monitor and report medical readiness and bioenvironmental engineering health
     risk assessment conditions.
     2.2.13. Provide recommendations regarding disease containment planning procedures
     IAW the Public Health Emergency Officer and other medical Subject Matter Experts
     (i.e., Public Health, Laboratory, and Bioenvironmental Engineers).
  2.3. CAT Director (CAT-D). The CAT is designed to allow the 55 WG/CC and subordinate
  commanders the ability to carry out their command responsibilities. The CAT-D is delegated
  the responsibility for orchestrating the IC2 functions of the wing and is a conduit for
  presenting actionable information to the commanders. This does not preclude commanders
  from receiving and acting on information relative to their respective responsibilities.
     2.3.1. CAT-D duties will be performed by field grade officers, or the civilian equivalent,
     assigned to WG/XP and appointed by the 55 WG/CC based on their expertise and
     knowledge of the wing’s mission.
     2.3.2. During day-to-day steady state operations at home station, the Chief of the CP is
     responsible for the CAT processes. Once the CAT team has been activated, the CAT-D
     is responsible to the 55 WG/CC for effective CAT operations.
     2.3.3. The CAT-D orchestrates the diverse individual entities within the CAT for the 55
     WG/CC and facilitates the day-to-day coordination and support of all CAT elements
     required for effectively maintaining and operating the wing.
     2.3.4. At the 55 WG/CC’s discretion, the CAT-D may be a 24/7 position. If not, a
     rotational schedule must be developed to provide immediate on-call CAT-D support.
     2.3.5. The primary tool used by the CAT-D is the Commander’s Situation Briefing. The
     purpose of this brief is to inform the 55 WG/CC of the condition and readiness of the
     support facilities, deployed forces and ongoing or planned operations.
6                                                   OFFUTTAFBI10-221 20 OCTOBER 2011


    2.4. ICC/CAT Coordinator. The ICC/CAT Coordinator (CAT-C) assists the CAT-D in
    managing the diverse individual entities within the CAT for the 55 WG/CC. The CAT-C
    assists in the day-to-day coordination and support of all CAT elements required for
    effectively maintaining and operating the wing. The CAT-C will normally be company
    grade officers, the civilian equivalent, or Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO), and are
    selected and appointed by WG/XP based on their expertise and knowledge of the wing’s
    mission.
       2.4.1. All military personnel assigned to 55 WG/XP below field grade rank will be
       trained to perform CAT-C duties as determined by the XP Director.
    2.5. Command Post (CP). The CP serves as the wing’s 24/7/365 C2 node directly
    responsible to the 55 WG/CC for C2 and Nuclear C2 (NC2). All IC2 nodes will relay
    notifications and status updates directly to the CP. The CP controllers will coordinate C2
    checklists with the CAT, MOC, ECC, Emergency Operations Center (EOC), and all other C2
    nodes and tenants supporting wing activities when these centers are activated. When CAT
    nodes and functions are co-located, commanders will ensure all security disciplines are met
    and a risk assessment is completed IAW applicable security directives. CP controller
    responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
       2.5.1. Mission monitor (i.e., flight following) all flying operations, to include performing
       aircrew alerting and klaxon procedures.
       2.5.2. Receive, validate, and respond to EAMs, missile warning, NORAD and United
       States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) alerts and FPCON actions.
       2.5.3. Facilitate EM C2 information flow in support of the CAT, Mission Support,
       Maintenance, and Operations Teams.
       2.5.4. Execute quick reaction checklists (QRCs) and alert key and/or base personnel in
       response to crises or emergencies.
       2.5.5. Initiate base control procedures via sirens, klaxon, telephone and network alerting
       systems (TAS/NAS) and Giant Voice/Installation Notification and Warning System
       (INWS), and other mass notification systems (MNS).
       2.5.6. Prepare and transmit operational reports (OPREP) IAW AFI 10-206 and
       MAJCOM/DRU supplements.
       2.5.7. Manage the AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) IAW
       and MAJCOM/DRU supplements.
       2.5.8. Refer to AFI 10-207, Command Post for a complete listing of requirements,
       specific duties and responsibilities.
    2.6. CAT Staff. The CAT-D and CAT-C provide direct operational and administrative
    support to the CAT. Communications support is provided by on-call personnel.
    2.7. CAT Organization. The CAT provides the 55 WG/CC with a C2 capability through
    which to direct operations. The CAT assists commanders in the performance of their duties.
    The CAT is not a link in the chain of command—commanders work for commanders; their
    staffs, including the agencies that come together to form the CAT, are organized to provide
OFFUTTAFBI10-221 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                               7


  support. As such, the CAT will employ personnel and equipment from across the
  installation.
     2.7.1. When the CAT is activated, the CAT-D on duty is the 55 WG/CC’s appointed
     representative, responsible for facilitating rapid response to time-sensitive bed down,
     contingency, and mission-critical decisions.
  2.8. Communications. CAT’s communications must support connectivity across the
  installation; to airborne, mobile, and fixed operational nodes; to Global Information Grid
  (GIG) systems for CONUS-wide and global connectivity; and to civilian communications
  networks. CAT communications requirements may include land- mobile radio (LMR),
  Emergency Mass Notification System (EMNS) (i.e., Giant Voice, telephone, Defense Red
  Switch Network (DRSN), Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS) (and its
  follow-on system), and computers (NIPR and SIPRnets). Operations Security (OPSEC),
  Communications Security (COMSEC), Information Security (INFOSEC) and Computer
  Security (COMPUSEC) must be considered when equipping a CAT.
  2.9. CP Facility. The CP facility is critical to the success of the wing’s mission and adequate
  security must be maintained. This becomes an even larger concern when ICC functions have
  been combined into one facility. The CP facility will be protected at the same level as the
  operations that it supports. During CAT operations, regardless of PL, a guard (provided by
  Security Forces) will be posted unless released by the Chief of CP.
  2.10. Alternate CP Facility. An alternate operating location for each C2 node contributing to
  the IC2 function is necessary to ensure continuity of operations in the event of outages at a
  given IC2 node. When activated, the alternate CP will be protected at the same PL rating as
  the primary. It will also be identified appropriately in the IDP. The alternate facility, or
  facilities, must be sufficiently equipped to continue supporting the installation mission with
  minimal disruption. The alternate facility/facilities must be located far enough away from
  the primary facility/facilities so as not to be affected by the same outages or conditions.
  Relocation will be exercised semi-annually as a minimum, and will include:
     2.10.1. Publications and materials required for operations.
     2.10.2. Flashlights, one copy of all checklists (if applicable), paper copies of required
     forms, computer(s), radios, cellular telephones and other materials deemed necessary for
     sustained operations.
     2.10.3. Expedient and secure transport for personnel, classified, a nd COMSEC material
     to and from the alternate facility. Locations with COMSEC material must also consider
     emergency destruction procedures.
     2.10.4. Rendezvous location(s) and routes of travel.
     2.10.5. If flying operations are ongoing, consideration should be given to obtaining a
     vehicle with suitable communications.

3. EXECUTION
    3.1. Concept of Operations. The Primary CAT is comprised of the 55 WG/CC, an
    Operations Team, a Maintenance Team, a Mission Support Team, a Medical Team, a CG
    Team, CAT-D, CAT-C, and the CP. The 55th Wing’s full CAT staff will form at the
    direction of HHQ or the 55 WG/CC. See attachment 2 of this instruction for a listing of the
    full CAT staff.
       3.1.1. CAT operations are conducted in conjunction with:
           3.1.1.1. Support to Operations Plan (OPLAN) execution / contingency operations.
           3.1.1.2. Increased readiness.
           3.1.1.3. Direction during actual or simulated disasters / major accident responses.
           3.1.1.4. Operational Readiness Inspections or Operational Readiness Exercises.
           3.1.1.5. Discretion of 55 WG/CC.
       3.1.2. The 55 WG/CC directs the CAT team and provides the command decisions to
       accomplish the tasked mission/operation(s).
       3.1.3. CAT operations involve staff coordination, direction, and monitoring of all
       necessary wing activities in support of OPLAN / Operations Order (OPORD) or situation
       inputs / events.
       3.1.4. Once assembled, the CAT will function until released by the 55 WG/CC. The
       CAT team will manage all wing activities during emergencies, contingency taskings,
       emergency war order actions, or other conditions determined by the 55 WG/CC.
       3.1.5. CAT team members are responsible for monitoring/initiating reportable events and
       will provide the information to CP personnel in a timely manner for reports to HHQ.
       3.1.6. Individual CAT team members are responsible for dissemination of CAT derived
       information to their applicable units/groups and for controlling those actions applicable to
       their units/groups.
    3.2. CAT Membership. The 55 WG/CC has designated a group of key personnel who will
    form the CAT and will support CAT team operations. Refer to Attachment 2 for CAT
    members.
       3.2.1. Tasked units will man each CAT position continuously.        The on-duty
       representative may leave the CAT area with the concurrence of the 55 WG/CC or
       designated representative.
       3.2.2. When conditions no longer warrant continuous operations, the 55 WG/CC may
       selectively reduce manning to an appropriate level.
       3.2.3. The procedures and checklists in this plan are general and cover the expected
       scenarios. All tasked agencies and individuals must remain flexible to respond to other
       scenarios and rapidly changing situations.
       3.2.4. Individuals responsible for CAT duty must possess thorough knowledge of unit
       and base support plans for both contingency plans and USSTRATCOM OPLAN 8010.

         4.1.1.1. The 55 WG/CP initiates notification for CAT members to assemble.
         4.1.1.2. The CAT initial assessment briefing will contain all pertinent information
         requiring assembly of the CAT. Due to the very limited time available for compiling
         this data, CAT members must respond immediately upon notification. Appropriate
         CAT members will report to the CAT when notified by CP personnel using verbiage
         directed by the 55 WG/CC, or the information found in Attachment 2. Additional
         recalled personnel will report immediately to the CAT as directed.

         briefing ASAP. This briefing presents CAT members with initial information on the
         nature and extent of the situation and any immediate action required. THE INITIAL
         ASSESSMENT BRIEFING WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH REQUIRED
         CRITICAL ACTIONS. After the briefing, the 55 WG/CC may release all or part of
         the CAT.

             4.1.3.5.2. Initial Assessment Briefing. The CAT-D will present an initial briefing
             ASAP. This is a short brief to identify the tasking followed by a 55 WG/CC-led
             discussion providing direction to meet the tasking. The brief should last no longer
             than 10 - 15 minutes to allow group commanders to prepare for the Initial CAT
             Brief at Reference Start Time (RST) + 2:00. The 55 WG/CC may waive this
             briefing and begin with an Initial CAT Brief. The CAT-D signals classified
             briefings by turning on the red overhead light in the center of the ceiling.
             4.1.3.5.3. Initial CAT Brief: The Initial CAT Brief is planned to start at RST
             plus 2 hours (RST+2:00), or as directed by the 55 WG/CC. The Initia l CAT Brief
             provides as much information as possible concerning the wing’s tasking. Tailor
             the RST+2:00 Briefing and follow-on briefs to ensure only critical items are
             briefed. See Table 4.1 for Briefing Agenda.

   4.3. CAT Conventional/Contingency Actions.
      4.3.1. Upon receipt of a deployment order (Prepare to Deploy, Execute Order, etc.) 55
      WG/CP will notify 55 WG/XP and IDO. 55 WG/XP and IDO representatives will
      review the order and determine whether the 55 WG/CC should be notified. If so, the 55
      WG/CC will be briefed.
      4.3.2. Based on the nature of the order, the 55 WG/CC will determine the scope of the
      wing recall. A full wing pyramid recall may not be required to support tasking for
      conventional deployment/employment operations. Normally, only the Primary CAT
      Staff will be recalled. Recommended options are:
         4.3.2.1. Assemble the Primary CAT Staff/CAT Staff, as required.
         4.3.2.2. Initiate a full/partial wing recall, at the discretion of the 55 WG/CC.
         4.3.2.3. Brief appropriate information at the next scheduled stand-up meeting.
      4.3.3. Responsibilities:
         4.3.3.1. When notified of a CAT recall, regardless of the method of notification,
         CAT members will report immediately to the CAT area in the CP, unless directed
         otherwise.
         4.3.3.2. If not in continuous session, reform the CAT upon receipt of a(n);
         Planning/Warning Order, Alert Order, Deployment Order, Execute Order, or
         Implementation Order.
         4.3.3.3. The CAT will:
             4.3.3.3.1. Direct and monitor mobility operations.
             4.3.3.3.2. Direct and monitor employment operations when tasked to fight in-
             place.
             4.3.3.3.3. Review each unit’s shortfalls and limiting factors and report them to
             HQ ACC, 12 AF and 8 AF/TF 204, as required.

            4.3.3.3.4. Determine generation start and launch times, as required, to meet
            mission tasking.
  4.4. CAT Relocation.
     4.4.1. An alternate CAT location is required for survivability. Capability for rapid,
     secure relocation is necessary for continued C2, CAT direction and mission
     accomplishment.      Upon activation of the CAT or implementation of FORCE
     PROTECTION ―Charlie,‖ wing agencies must take steps necessary to ensure a viable
     alternate CAT facility is available.
     4.4.2. Relocation Procedures.
        4.4.2.1. These procedures only account for relocation of the Senior Staff, CAT, and
        key members of the CAT Staff. All other personnel will make their way to the
        alternate facility via whatever means are available to them.
        4.4.2.2. There are two potential scenarios. First, the CAT is in session for a short
        time. Therefore no vans have been requested, requiring use of other vehicles for
        transport to the alternate. Second, CAT operations are anticipated for an extended
        period and vans have been procured from LDD Transportation section for relocation
        purposes.
        4.4.2.3. When the CAT is expected to remain in session for an extended period
        (greater than 4 hours), the CP will request four 15 – passenger vans from the LDD
        Transportation section dispatcher and inform them of the required time and place of
        delivery. 55 WG/CC and 55 OG/CC vehicles are also used during relocation.
        4.4.2.4. Remain in the building, if possible, until all members are ready to relocate.
        4.4.2.5. The designated rally point is at the south side of building 458, by Flight
        Records, room 153, using door ―D.‖
        4.4.2.6. If circumstances allow, return to the primary location, then follow these
        procedures in reverse.
     4.4.3. Relocation Tasks.
        4.4.3.1. CAT-D/-C duties:
        4.4.3.2. Coordinate details to ensure the CAT team, CAT-D, administrative support,
        and Command Post personnel, and the Security Force Entry Controller are relocated.
        4.4.3.3. Time permitting, run the Button-Up checklist.
        4.4.3.4. Ensure classified material is stored prior to relocation.
        4.4.3.5. Transport bags are located at each Primary CAT position and should be used
        to secure classified material designed to be moved to the alternate location.
        4.4.3.6. Remove STE Forteza cards and place them in the STE containe r at the CP
        representative’s position. Once all cards are collected, lock the box in the CP safe.
        4.4.3.7. Once the relocation is complete, take roll, run the Un-Button checklist,
        remind everyone to notify work centers of the relocation and complete an update
        brief.

        4.4.3.8. Notify 55 SFS of relocating members not accounted for.
        4.4.3.9. During routine CAT operations, XP personnel will move vans at least once
        per 24-hour period, to comply with Force Protection guidance.
     4.4.4. The 55th Security Forces Squadron duties:
        4.4.4.1. Escort the relocation movement with two radio-equipped patrols. The 55
        SFS CAT representative will coordinate the security escort.
        4.4.4.2. Dispatch an explosive detector team with a bomb dog to sweep the alternate
        CAT facility. It is located on the lower level of Building 303, the key is maintained
        in ECC, Bldg 288. Sweep the upper floor of the building immediately after
        relocation. The Language Learning Center may stay open during exercises unless
        business traffic interferes with the mission. During real world operations the 55
        WG/CC will determine if the Language Learning Center will stay open.
        4.4.4.3. Upon completion of the sweep, contact owners of vehicles parked adjacent to
        Bldg 303 ramp railing to move their Personally Owned Vehicles (POV). Once
        parking spaces are cleared, they will be reserved.
        4.4.4.4. Upon arrival, the 55 SFS Entry Controller (or 55 WG/CP personnel) will
        identify all personnel prior to entry (past the entrapment area).
     4.4.5. Transportation (LDDT) duties:
        4.4.5.1. When tasked, provide four 15 – passenger vans at the designated rally point
        and deliver the keys to the CP Operations Team.
     4.5.6. Traveling rules of engagement:
        4.5.6.1. Get in the assigned vehicles assembled at the rally point. The 55 WG/CC’s
        vehicle will be behind the lead security escort. The 55 SFS Entry Controller will ride
        with the 55 WG/CC to provide personal protection. The group commanders and
        designated CAT members follow. The 55 OG/CC will trail the convoy followed by a
        second SFS vehicle. NOTE: If runway crossing route is used, ensure all vehicles
        conduct a FOD check prior to entering the flight line.
        4.5.6.2. The CAT-D will publish and brief convoy seating, route and rules during
        CAT Briefing.

A3.1. Recall Procedures.
   A3.1.1. Wing recalls will be conducted to support operational requirements, emergency
   response, meet contingency/OPLAN requirements and local and HHQ’s directed exercises.
   A3.1.2. A recall may be initiated in the event of:
       A3.1.2.1. A local or national emergency.
       A3.1.2.2. Increased Defense Condition (DEFCON) or Force Protection Condition
       (FPCON) changes.
       A3.1.2.3. Delayed reporting or base closure.
       A3.1.2.4. Implementation of HHQ or wing plans.
       A3.1.2.5. Execution of HHQ inspection or locally generated recall exercise.
A3.2. Execution.
   A3.2.1. The primary method for recall will be through the ACC Emergency Mass
   Notification System (EMNS) AtHoc. This system will make contact with personnel through
   user defined contact information (telephone, e- mail, and SMS text). All wing military and
   civilian personnel are responsible for updating their contact info into the Offutt EMNS
   AtHOC system. Contractor personnel are required to update duty information only.
   A3.2.2. Primary CAT Staff will have a non-telephonic, comm-out recall capability (see this
   attachment). 55 WG/CP will develop, maintain, coordinate, and implement Primary Staff
   Communication Outage procedures, as directed by AFI 10-207, Command Post. 55 SFS will
   provide forces needed to execute the plan. Units will use non-telephonic recalls only when
   required.
   A3.2.3. Units will develop and use recall rosters as an aid to recall personnel. All unit
   military personnel will be included on a recall roster regardless of mobility status.
   A3.2.4. As a minimum, recall rosters will contain the information listed in this attachment
   (para A3.16.2.2.5).
   A3.2.5. Rosters. Alert recall rosters are prepared and used as internal management tools and
   contain some Personally Identifying Information (PII). As such, recall rosters must be
   protected as "For Official Use Only" information under the provisions of AF I 33-332,
   Privacy Act Program. All recall rosters must contain the following Privacy Act warning
   statement at the top or bottom of the roster: "Privacy Act Statement--Data contained on this
   communication is for use by authorized personnel and will not be disclosed to any person not
   otherwise authorized to receive this information IAW AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program;
   DoD 5400.7R/AFMAN 33-302 Freedom of Information Act, and DOD 5400.11R, Privacy
   Program. This communication is designated For Official Use Only (FOUO)". Place "FOR
   OFFICIAL USE ONLY" designation at the top and bottom of the recall roster.
   A3.2.6. The Wing Recall Program is structured to provide the 55 WG/CC or persons
   designated to perform official DoD functions within the 55 W G/CC purview with the
OFFUTTAFBI10-221 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                           33


   flexibility to conduct a Primary Staff recall, Crisis Action Team recall, selective recall,
   employee recall to duty for work centers with continuous coverage pass selective warning or
   readiness information, or a pyramid recall of all wing personnel. It affords the 55 WG/CC
   the ability to alert personnel either overtly or covertly. The 55 WG/CC or designated
   representative will always be the first person alerted and will make the decision to recall
   personnel when required.
   A3.2.7. Initial Actions. Nearly all emergency actions are routed through the 55 WG/CP.
   Exceptions are taskings that flow directly to the 55 WG/CC. In all cases, the 55 WG/CC or
   designated representative will be promptly notified of the tasking. At this point, the 55
   WG/CC has six options: delay any further action, convene the Primary CAT Staff, convene
   both the Primary and Secondary CAT, conduct a selective recall, release a general warning
   or readiness information message, or conduct a pyramid recall o f all 55 WG personnel
   assigned to Offutt AFB.
   A3.2.8. In the event the 55 WG/CC directs a recall of the Primary CAT Staff (see Figure
   A3.1.), 55 WG/CP will use the following matrix to initiate the recall:

Figure A3.1. Primary CAT Recall.




Note: Asterisks (*) indicate non-primary CAT Member. Dashed ( ) lines indicate
notification through a group/unit developed process. 55 WG/CP will notify 55 SFS and a
guard will be posted. Tenant notifications will be made as required.

A3.2 9. In the event the 55 WG/CC directs a recall of the Primary CAT Staff, the Secondary
CAT (See Figure A3.2), and a pyramid recall, 55 WG/CP will use the following matrix to initiate
the recall:

Figure A3.2. Secondary CAT Recall.




Note: Asterisks (*) indicate non-primary CAT/CAT Member. Dashed ( ) lines indicate
notification through a group/unit developed process. 55 WG/CP will notify 55 SFS and a
guard will be posted. Tenant notifications will be made as required.
OFFUTTAFBI10-221 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                                35


A3.3.10. Units will develop methods to activate the recall system. For most units, their
respective UCC, 24-hour work center, or operations center will start the process. The unit
commander/deputy or designated substitute will be the first person notified. All units or any part
of the wing could be recalled. This will be based on the guidance contained in the 55 WG/CP
recall message to group commanders.
   A3.3.11. When a recall is activated, individuals will respond expeditiously. Personnel will
   not delay in order to shower or eat, but are to report to their duty sections ASAP with all
   personal clothing and baggage required for deployment. Units will establish accountability
   procedures to monitor the recall process.
   A3.3.12. Units will designate a unit control point for recall accountability. Recalled
   individuals will report duty status to this control point. This control point is responsible for
   passing progress and completion information to their G/UCC (if different than the control
   point).
   A3.3.13. Units will establish written procedures to govern their recall programs. This
   written guidance may be in the form of a supplement to this instruction, a unit plan, unit
   regulation, or operating instruction.
A3.4. Pyramid Recall.
   A3.4.1. When expedient action is necessary the 55 WG/CC may opt to recall the wing. If a
   pyramid recall is initiated, the Full CAT will form ASAP. 55 WG/CP will implement
   pyramid recalls.
   A3.4.2. Group/squadron commanders and section chiefs will:
       A3.4.2.1. Initiate their personnel pyramid recalls as required.
       A3.4.2.2. Ensure personnel who reside in dormitories are notified.
       A3.4.2.3. Ensure Tenant Unit notifications are complete.
       A3.4.2.4. Mission Support Group agencies may be contacted to ensure the childcare
       center is operating, dining facility hours have been extended and the Deployment Control
       Center (DCC) is activated.
   A3.4.3. 55 MSG/CC will activate the Personnel Control Center (PCC) to monitor the recall
   process. During a recall, Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR) serves as the PCC and
   reports directly to the CAT. If TBMCS is unavailable, the PCC must be prepared to report
   recall numbers to the CAT.
   A3.4.4. Recall may be directed by HHQ in an emergency caused by a natural disaster
   (earthquake, severe flooding, etc.) In this case, the Air Force Personnel Availability and
   Accountability System (AFPAAS) will be used for accountability.
A3.5. 55 WG/CP will:
   A3.5.1. Upon notification of an actual or exercise Alert Order, Warning Order, Prepare to
   Deploy Order (PTDO), Execute Order (EXORD), or Deployment Order (DEPORD), notify
   the 55 Wing, Director of Plans and Programs (XP) via secure means, who will recommend
   notifying the 55 WG/CC or designated representative, as appropriate. The 55 WG/XP
   Director will recommend a course of action to the 55 WG/CC, to include type of recall and
 36                                                 OFFUTTAFBI10-221 20 OCTOBER 2011


   recall options, if warranted. (In addition, the 55 WG/CP will contact the 55 WG/IDO). The
   55 WG/CC will decide if the recall should be overt or covert. Once a decision is made the 55
   WG/CP will implement recall actions IAW 55 WG/CP applicable checklists in this
   attachment. 55 WG/CP will institute recalls automatically if required by established
   USSTRATCOM and ACC guidance. Note: Covert communication systems include local
   telephone nets, Land Mobile Radios, encrypted UHF/VHF radio nets, base e- mail, and
   runners. Overt communication systems include local media outlets and base public address
   system (when installed).
   A3.5.2. Notify the 55 WG/CC and ―on-call‖ CAT-D for the following situations (real world
   or exercise): natural disaster, major aircraft accident (on/off-base), mass casualty event,
   HAZMAT incident, terrorist attack/threat, or bomb threat. For a suspicious package, notify
   the “on-call” CAT-D only if the EOC is recalled. The CAT-D will recommend a course of
   action to the 55 WG/CC. If CAT recall is warranted, 55 WG/CP will implement recall
   actions IAW 55 WG/CP applicable checklists of this attachment.
   A3.5.3. Non-telephonic Recall:
       A3.5.3.1. If the commercial telephone system is out of commission, alternate
       communications will be utilized to include Land Mobile Radios, Television, Radio,
       Sound trucks, etc.
       A3.5.3.2. 55 WG/CP will use any means available to contact the 55 WG/CC or
       designated representative. Such means will include, but not be limited to:
           A3.5.3.2.1. During normal duty hours, contacting ECC personnel and directing
           implementation of the Primary CAT Staff Communications Outage Recall Plan.
           A3.5.3.2.2. The CC’s radio net.
           A3.5.3.2.3. The SOF via UHF or the 55 WG/CC’s radio net.
           A3.5.3.2.4. 55 SFS via the SOF.
           A3.5.3.2.5. Any alternate means commensurate with the situation.
A3.6. All units. Recall plans will include a primary and backup procedure for recalling
personnel that assumes outage of normal communications. Units will concentrate on recalling
off-base personnel first. The 55 WG CAT will concentrate on recalling on-base personnel
utilizing Giant Voice, Sound Trucks, and runners.
A3.7. Primary CAT Staff Recalls. The Primary CAT Staff recall affords the 55 WG/CC the
opportunity to bring in key staff members to discuss matters prior to a plan or concept being
directed or implemented by HHQs and mobilization or aircraft generation. In addition, the
Primary CAT Staff should be recalled for critical wing events. As a guide, these events include:
natural disasters, major aircraft incidents/accidents (on/off-base), mass casualty events, or
HAZMAT incidents. Implement recall of the Primary CAT Staff IAW this attachment.
   A3.7.1. A 55 WG/XP representative will function as the CAT-D and as focal point for the
   CAT Staff.
   A3.7.2. Crisis Action Team Recalls. The CAT recall affords the 55 WG/CC the opportunity
   to brief key staff members prior to aircraft generation. As a rule of thumb, this type of recall
   will be used to review a significant intelligence event, a contingency operation prior to wing
OFFUTTAFBI10-221 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                             37


   mobilization, actions required prior to arrival of a HHQ’s inspection team, or a key/critical
   wing event. Recall procedures are contained in this Attachment.
   A3.7.3. A complete pyramid recall will only be conducted upon 55 WG/CC’s direction.
   A3.7.4. An Accountability recall for military only be conducted upon 55 WG/CC’s direction
   and tracked in TBMCS. If an Accountability recall is conducted for Military and Civilian
   personnel utilize procedures in paragraph A3.6.5.


A3.8. Eme rgency Operations Cente r (EOC) Recall.
   A3.8.1. EOC recall is initiated by the 55 WG/CP by using the Secondary Crash Net and a
   pager system.
   A3.8.2. The 55 WG/CC, WG/CV, MSG/CC, MSG/CD, Fire Chief, or Civil Engineering
   Readiness representative will call the 55 WG/CP to direct the recall of the EOC.
   A3.8.3. The 55 WG/CP will direct Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops) personnel to
   activate the Secondary Crash Net. After activation, AM Ops will then direct all parties to
   standby for a message from the 55 WG/CP. The on-duty 55 WG/CP controller will relay the
   appropriate information over the net.
   A3.8.4. Following Secondary Crash Net announcement, the 55 WG/CP controller will
   activate the EOC pager system informing members where and when to report.
   A3.8.5. EOC members that are not represented by 24- hour agencies are required to carry a
   pager tied into the EOC pager system and be ready to respond.
   A3.8.6. Composition of the EOC is contained in AFI 10-2502, Air Force Incident
   Management System (AFIMS) Standards And Procedures.
A3.9. Specific Recall Tasks.
   A3.9.1. The 55 WG/CC will:
       A3.9.1.1. Direct implementation of appropriate recall or as directed by HHQ.
       A3.9.1.2. Direct recall of the 55 WG Primary CAT Staff, Secondary CAT and/or the 55
       WG as required.
       A3.9.1.3. Primary CAT Staff Recall guidance: Primary CAT Staff should be recalled if
       generation is anticipated and timing is over 96 hours away, or for critical wing events.
       A3.9.1.4. Primary and Secondary CAT Staff Recall guidance: conduct a complete CAT
       Staff recall for a significant intelligence event which may generate a tasking, a
       contingency operation, arrival of a HHQ inspection, or if a critical wing event warrants.
       A3.9.1.5. Provide Pyramid Recall guidance when expedient action is necessary, usually
       when generation will begin in the next 12 to 48 hours.
       A3.9.1.6. Determine if recall of personnel on leave or TDY is necessary.
       A3.9.1.7. Monitor the recall process and ensure the necessary staff has responded
       accordingly.
       A3.9.1.8. Terminate recall as required.

   A3.9.2. Group commanders, deputy commanders and unit commanders will:
      A3.9.2.1. Establish procedures for the recall of all personnel assigned to their
      organization.
      A3.9.2.2. Identify Mission Essential (Key) personnel in their organization (see para
      A3.12.). Commanders must determine which functions comprise their key staff and
      which individuals are required to respond to the various types of contingencies. Each
      unit must ensure their mobility personnel are called early in the recall.
      A3.9.2.3. Establish procedures for the recall of CAT members, as required.
      A3.9.2.4. Build a schematic diagram to include recall personnel, reporting instructions,
      and required mobility items. Recall roster standards are contained in this attachment.
      Rosters do not have to contain addresses, however, each unit will maintain a list of
      addresses and procedures for a non-telephonic recall.
      A3.9.2.5. Develop ―communications out‖ recall procedures.
      A3.9.2.6. Establish group/unit control centers ASAP.
      A3.9.2.7. Establish accountability measures and assess and monitor the recall process.
      A3.9.2.8. Ensure changes to the recall roster are made as they occur and are entered in

      after arriving on base. Observe posted speed limits and traffic safety guidelines when
      responding.
      A3.9.3.3. Ensure individual information in AtHoc and on recall roster is current and
      correct.
A3.10. Readiness.
   A3.10.1. During a recall the IPR also serves as the unit PCC, who will report directly to the
   CAT. If TBMCS is unavailable, the PCC must be prepared to report recall numbers to the
   CAT. In the event of a natural disaster recall, AFPAAS will be used for accountability.
   A3.10.2. Group commanders will ensure units have identified members as Mission Essential
   (Key) or Emergency Essential Personnel based on crisis, contingency, or support plans.
   A3.10.3. Mission Essential (Key) Personnel. This term is situation-dependent, and based on
   55 WG/CC assessment of current situation or conditions. To aid in this determination, group
   commanders should classify personnel according to the following four tiers:
      A3.10.3.1. Tier 1 Personnel. Personnel supporting all day-to-day wing operations
      (operations normal); to include all flight operations, ground training events, and
      deployment of personnel to support world-wide taskings.
OFFUTTAFBI10-221 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                              39


     A3.10.3.2. Tier 2 Personnel. Personnel supporting wing functions focusing on the
     wing’s ability to conduct world-wide ISR taskings. (Assumption: all ground and flight
     training events are suspended to allow these personnel to focus on their primary duties,
     and mission accomplishment.)
     A3.10.3.3. Tier 3 Personnel. Personnel who support Minimum Essential Operations;
     operations based on the current situation, environmental conditions or threat.
     A3.10.3.4. Tier 4 Personnel. Personnel supporting functions that place the base in a
     caretaker status. The 55 WG/CC will direct the individuals required.
  A3.10.4. Emergency Essential Personnel. Offutt Civilian Workforce members that occupy a
  war-time deployable position. These individuals will be tracked (coded) IAW AFI 36-507,
  Mobilization Of The Civilian Work.
  A3.10.5. Minimum Essential Operations. Minimum essential operations are the minimum
  functions required to meet mission accomplishment based on the current situation, weather
  condition, or threat. These functions are situation-dependent and will be determined by the
  group commanders based on guidance from the 55 WG/CC. These operations are selected to
  place the least number of wing personnel in peril and therefore only require a minimum
  number of personnel to report to their duty stations. The following personnel are considered
  essential to wing operations: key group/unit staff personnel and only those agencies
  designated by the 55 WG/CC to provide essential services based on the assessed risk (e.g.
  snow removal teams reporting after a major winter storm are different from a security force
  defending a terrorist attack to the base). As a minimum, group/squadron commanders must
  review the following documents to aid in their determination: Emergency Comprehensive
  Management Plan 10-2 and associated checklists, the Offutt AFB Snow Removal Plan, the
  55 WG Mishap Response Plan, and the 55 WG Disease Containment Plan.
  A3.10.6. Civilian personnel, except for individuals identified by group/unit CCs, will not be
  included in the recall process unless their inclusion is on a voluntary basis or is required by
  their contract.
  A3.10.7. Recall rosters will be developed for general recalls and key staff recalls. Rosters
  will be reviewed monthly and updated as necessary to ensure effectiveness. IAW AFI 10-
  207, paragraph 2.6.12, all units, including tenant units, will forward copies to 55 WG/CP.
  Reports will be forwarded NLT than the fifth day of each quarter, October, January, April,
  and July or whenever changes occur.
  A3.10.8. Each group/squadron will designate an area to stand- up a Group/Unit Control
  Center (GCC/UCC) to monitor the recall process.
  A3.10.9. Each group/squadron commander will develop a program to track all assigned
  personnel unavailable for duty.
  A3.10.10. Group/squadron commanders will ensure that personnel are trained to operate
  control centers and are aware of the personnel reporting requirements. Minimum training
  will include the CES/CEX UCC course and the TBMCS-UL Introduction course.
  A3.10.11. Recall accountability programs will be established in each group/unit. Aircrews
  placed into crew rest prior to RT will be counted as present for duty.
 40                                                 OFFUTTAFBI10-221 20 OCTOBER 2011


   A3.10.12. All personnel must be familiar with their recall roster. They must know who
   above them will (or might) initiate the recall, and who they (in turn) will have to call. If the
   person below you is unavailable, call the next individual in line. Units may also designate a
   person(s) to make calls if desired. All personnel must be prepared to respond immediately.
A3.11. Reporting.
   A3.11.1. CAT members should expect their first meeting to begin ASAP.
   A3.11.2. TBMCS is the primary means for reporting, with telephone follow-up. If required,
   manning strength reports will be forwarded by runner. (See this Attachment for Manual
   Strength Accountability Form.)
   A3.11.3. Once UCCs and GCCs are active and tracking unit personnel recall numbers in
   TBMCS, they will call the Wing PCC (294-9896/9897) to establish connectivity. The Wing
   PCC will notify the CAT if a unit has not called within 60 minutes of the RT.
   A3.11.4. UCCs will input recall status into TBMCS NLT RT plus 60 minutes and every 60
   minutes thereafter until achieving 100 percent accountability. GCCs will monitor UCC
   recall numbers and ensure they have been properly input into TBMCS. The wing goal for
   accountability is as quickly as possible, but no less than 95 percent accountable (based on
   total of participating wing units) by RT plus 180 minutes (3 hours).
   A3.11.5. The PCC will monitor recall status in TBMCS and periodically capture strength
   figures by squadron in the event of TBMCS outage. This data will be forwarded to the CAT
   within 30 minutes of request.
   A3.11.6. UCCs will maintain a listing of all individuals unavailable for duty (TDY, leave,
   quarters, DNIF, etc.). The 55 WG/CC must direct units to either recall personnel from
   leave/TDY or to simulate the actions required. Military Personnel Section has the ab ility to
   pull a Unit Leave Roster for base personnel in case of recall from leave situation.
A3.12. Operational Constraints. Although OPSEC may be difficult with the large number of
respondents to a general recall, personnel must ensure their actions continue to protect wing
operations.
A3.13. Other Considerations.
   A3.13.1. Force Support squadron (FSS). When directed, the 55 MSG/CC will direct the FSS
   Commander to extend the hours of the child care center.
   A3.13.2. Deployment Control Center (DCC ). This should be activated through the 55
   MSG/CC as directed by the 55 WG/CC when personnel or cargo processing is anticipated.
   A3.13.3. PA must be ready to respond to local community queries.
A3.14. Alerting Procedures and Formats.
   A3.14.1. Personnel are required to maintain a copy of their unit’s recall roster and
   instructions by their telephone or in a readily available location.
   A3.14.2. Callers will:
       A3.14.2.1. If notification is received via EMNS AtHoc, respond as directed.
       A3.14.2.2. If notification is NOT received via EMNS AtHOC:
OFFUTTAFBI10-221 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                             41


         A3.14.2.2.1. Refer to recall roster and complete calling chain, as appropriate.
         Comply with all instructions given in the recall message. Ensure the chain is not
         broken. If unable to contact the next person on your roster, continue down the roster
         until you reach the next available person. Contact your supervisor or GCC/UCC with
         the names of individuals you were unable to contact.
         A3.14.2.2.2. Relay the appropriate recall statement (used by the previous individual).
         The Recall Time (RT) in this statement is the time the recall is initiated by the 55
         WG/CC and is NOT an official RT. The official RT will be forwarded through
         official channels from the Personnel Control Center (PCC). The CAT-D or 55
         WG/CP Representative will validate the time and contact the PCC.
         A3.14.2.2.3. Designated security forces augmentation personnel will report with
         issued equipment.
         A3.14.2.2.4. Telephone Standby. When placed on telephone standby, individuals
         MUST be able to respond within 1 hour of notification or as directed with all required
         equipment and fit for duty. Telephone standby includes cell phones, and that
         information must be available to your supervisor.
         A3.14.2.2.5. All personnel will provide their unit commander and supervisor with a
         residence address and telephone number at which they can be reached during non-
         duty hours. In addition to personnel contact information, recall rosters will also
         contain:

         A3.17.5.1.2. Announce ―This is Airfield Management Operations with the daily
         check of the secondary crash net. Please answer with the clarity of the reception and
         your operating initials, when polled.‖
         A3.17.5.1.3. Proceed with the poll.
         A3.17.5.1.4. If a station does not answer, repeat the station’s name.       If still no
         answer, proceed to the next station.
         A3.17.5.1.5. After completing the poll, transmit, ―This concludes the secondary crash
         net check, please secure your line.‖
         A3.17.5.1.6. After the check is complete, call any station not responding to the poll
         and obtain the following information:
             A3.17.5.1.6.1. Did the secondary crash phone ring?
             A3.17.5.1.6.2. Was the message received?
             A3.17.5.1.6.3. Did the receiving party transmit a response?
             A3.17.5.11.6.4. Instruct the subscriber to report all secondary crash net problems
             to the communications maintenance operations center (CMOC) (294-6662). The
             subscriber is responsible for follow-up and completion of repairs.
  A3.17.6. On Wednesdays, AM Ops will conduct an extended secondary crash net and
  secondary crash net back-up system check. This check will be conducted immediately
  following the poll of the two-way capable stations. Each station will call AM Ops, 294-3207
  or 294-3240, with the clarity of reception and their operating initials.
  A3.17.7. AM Ops will log the secondary crash net check and indicate any party that did not
  respond on AF Form 3616, Daily Record of Facility Operation.
  A3.17.8. There may be occasions when it is necessary to conduct a check for one or more
  stations but not the complete net. AM Ops has the capability to activate a single station at a
  time for these checks.
  A3.17.9. If necessary, the 55 WG/CP may relay any emergency or operational information
  over the Secondary Crash Net. The 55 WG/CP will contact AM Ops via the hotline and ask
  them to activate the net. AM Ops will then direct agencies to ―Standby for Message from the
  Fifty-Fifth Wing Command Post‖. The 55 WG/CP will then relay the nece ssary information.
  A3.17.10. AM Ops personnel are authorized to relay information via the Secondary Crash
  Net. For example, actual/exercise bomb threats or terrorist activities if receives from
  Command Post, or information pertaining to actual/exercise emergencies if received from the
