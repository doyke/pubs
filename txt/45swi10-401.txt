1. General. A plan is a documented course of action that informs participants of the roles,
responsibilities, and relationships governing the activities and performance of an organization
during an operation or event. These roles, responsibilities, and relationships, and the associated
processes and procedures are to be used on a one-time or as-needed basis during the operation
governed by that plan. A plan ensures full coordination, training, and exercise (dry-run practice
or table-top simulation) occurs before an event takes place. Since wing plans are generally
written in response to a requirement identified in an Air Force Instruction (AFI), a Headquarters
Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) directive, or locally established need and the principal
focus of the plan or the requirement will dictate which type of plan is created as follows:
45SWI10-401 22 JULY 2010                                                                         3


   1.1. Operating Plan (Plan). A written list of prepared instructions for a non-contingency
   operation. This type of plan does not give guidance or direction in a wartime scenario, but
   rather guidance in the operations of a limited, recurring task.
   1.2. Operations Plan (OPlan). Any employment or deployment plan for conducting joint
   operations in response to a requirement established by the Joint Chief of Staff. OPlans are
   usually written in the wing plans office due to their classification and limited distribution.
   1.3. Supporting Plan. Written when an agency/unit has a requirement to support another
   agency/unit on a one-time, non-recurring basis (for example, a unit wants to use Base X for a
   flying mission). The support plan will consist of dates, runway hours required, hangar space
   required, billeting and messing required, etc. The support plan will include points of contact
   for both the deploying unit and the operating base as well as signatures from both.
   1.4. Programming Plan (PPlan). A formal planning document written below HQ USAF
   level that helps accomplish and record major actions. Promotes a smooth flow of direction to
   accomplish a required objective (for example, activating a new unit).
   1.5. Concept Plan (CONPlan). Accomplished when a theater concept of operations is
   accepted by higher headquarters, but does not require all the details of an OPlan. Usually
   does not contain time-phased force deployment data (TPFDD).
   1.6. In-Garrison and Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP). Assesses the base capability to
   support wartime and contingency operations. It has two parts. Part 1 identifies the base’s
   total support capability. Part 2 is an assessment of the base’s ability to support either a most
   demanding contingency operation or a number of specific contingency operations with the
   resources identified in Part 1.
   1.7. Contingency Plan. Used for major contingencies that can reasonably be anticipated in
   principal geographic sub-areas of a command.
   1.8. Exercise Plan. Guidance for a specific exercise. The exercise may be combined, joint,
   or single service depending on participating organizations.
2. Responsibilities:
   2.1. The 45th Space Wing Commander (45 SW/CC), or the 45th Space Wing Vice
   Commander (45 SW/CV), approves and signs new plans when required by higher
   headquarters, instruction, OPORD, or directive. Otherwise, group commanders or deputy
   group commanders may sign and approve plans or may elevate plans for CC/CV signature if
   they deem appropriate. The 45 SW/CV generally signs and approves plans generated within
   a wing staff organization.
   2.2. The office of primary responsibility (OPR): 45 SW/XP recommends which
   organization will be the overall OPR for each plan. This assessment is based on the
   preponderance of activity or support described in the plan as well as subject matter expertise.
   Any challenge to OPR assignments will be resolved by the 45 SW/CV.
       2.2.1. Develops plan(s) and ensures proper construction and formats are used.
       2.2.2. Identifies tasked organizations.
       2.2.3. Coordinates the plan with all affected agencies.
 4                                                                    45SWI10-401 22 JULY 2010


        2.2.4. Conducts annual reviews of the plan to keep it current.
        2.2.5. Makes distribution of the plan to all users.
        2.2.6. Ensures the TurboDOCS status field accurately reflects the status of plan(s) in
        review.
        2.2.7. Ensures plan POCs (action officers) are identified in writing to 45 SW/XPI.
     2.3. Agreements and Plans (45 SW/XPI):
        2.3.1. Manages the 45 SW plans program and maintains the Plans Master Library to
        include OPLANS applicable to the 45 SW.
        2.3.2. Publishes and distributes a plans index annually, or as changes occur.
        2.3.3. Reviews/coordinates on all new plans and changes to existing plans.
        2.3.4. Ensures plans are reviewed annually by OPRs.
        2.3.5. Ensures compliance with higher headquarters or locally established directives.
        2.3.6. Provides guidance to organizations as needed.
     2.4. Tasked Organizations:
        2.4.1. Review plans for compliance.
        2.4.2. Ensure the most recent guidance and current information is being utilized.
3. Plan Development:
     3.1. Office of Primary Responsibility. The OPR has the overall responsibility to ensure the
     plan is written properly, has all required inputs, is distributed to the correct receivers, and is
     reviewed annually. For an overview of this process use the Plan Development/Review
     Flowchart depicted in Attachment 2.
Note: The OPR for a 45 SW plan will generally be the squadron or two letter office in which the
action officer resides.
     3.2. Determine Required Tasked Organizations. The OPR determines which
     organizations should be tasked to provide required support or coordination, and considers
     who best provides the type of support needed. Mission success may be impacted if incorrect
     organizations are tasked. The OPR must ensure all tasked organizations are identified in
     Annex A and they coordinate on the plan prior to publication.
     3.3. Review Requirements. The OPR must review the plan annually, prior to the
     anniversary date. The purpose of the review is to check the information for accuracy,
     determine if the plan is still needed, and incorporate all changes that occurred during the
     year. If changes are needed or anticipated, the OPR must coordinate the plan with all
     affected agencies to ensure a comprehensive review is provided. Annual reviews do not
     always require a revision or re-publication be accomplished. If no changes are necessary, the
     OPRs may recommend that the plans do not need to be coordinated through the wing. In
     such situations, OPRs will have their group CC or deputy forward a Letter of Certification to
     XP requesting a new Annual Review date one year from the date the Annual Review was
     completed. See Attachment 3 example memorandum for Certification of Annual Plans
     Review. Otherwise, the OPR must produce change pages or re-publish the plan.
45SWI10-401 22 JULY 2010                                                                         5


      3.3.1. Review Findings. The findings of a successful annual plans review will result in
      one of three outcomes: a) a re-publication of the plan signed by the wing commander,
      vice wing commander, or group CC or deputy; b) publication of a change package
      including a Letter of Transmittal and change pages approved by the vice wing
      commander, or group commander; or c) a certification declaration by the vice wing
      commander, or group CC or deputy, that the plan is “current and usable in its present
      form”, i.e., no changes are required. See Attachment 3.
      3.3.2. Delegations. Delegations for plan approvals or signatures below the vice wing
      commander or group commanders are not permitted.
   3.4. Plan Distribution. The OPR is responsible to distribute the plan and any changes to all
   organizations identified on distribution. 45 SW/XP will be included on distribution for all 45
   SW plans.
   3.5. Plan Requirement. A decision must be made concerning the adequacy of a plan versus
   a wing instruction or unit operating instruction. A plan will provide execution conditions for
   natural disasters, regional conflicts, or specific date related events. The OPR is responsible
   for writing a plan and maintaining it. The OPR must determine the scope of operation by
   reviewing all documents related to the requirement and incorporate previous plans if they
   exist. A new plan may be required in support of a specific higher headquarters tasking.
   3.6. Determine Scope and Objective. When a plan is needed, the OPR will outline the
   scope of the operation to be planned for and list objectives that must be met to accomplish
   the mission. The OPR should take an overall look at the plan and determine what
   information is required in the plan summary.
   3.7. Plan Support. Each base is required to develop an In-Garrison and Expeditionary Site
   Plan (IGESP). Part I of the In-Garrison and Expeditionary Site Plan identifies resources and
   capabilities of a location by functional area and is the focus of the expeditionary site survey.
   For contingency requirements, Part II of the plan allocates resources identified in Part I,
   assesses the ability to support the operation, and identifies limiting factors (LIMFACs). It is
   through these plans that all units operating out of the location become familiar with existing
   resource allocations and key tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Information
   contained in the IGESP is helpful when initially developing a plan.
   3.8. Numbering a Plan. The plan is numbered after the implementing directive or
   functional equivalent. Note: Please contact 45 SW/XPI to coordinate assignment of plan
   number. If more than one plan will use the same number, sub-indenture the plans
   accordingly using an Alpha Suffix, i.e. 32-7041-A, 32-7041-B. If the wing needs two
   different types of plans written against the same requirement, (CONPlan and COOP), this
   should be reflected in the title.
4. Updating a Plan.
   4.1. Plan Requirement. Plan OPR will annually revalidate the requirement for the plan. If
   a requirement still exists, check the plan for currency and accuracy. When a requirement no
   longer exists, a letter must be sent to all organizations listed (in Annex Z) justifying
   termination.
 6                                                                45SWI10-401 22 JULY 2010


     4.2. Conducting a Review. The OPR will conduct a review annually to determine if the
     scope of operation has changed. If in doubt, the OPR should have all organizations tasked in
     the plan review the plan and identify any required changes to the OPR. The coordination
     process for an annual review is the same process used for developing a new plan (see
     Attachment 2). Complete republication of the plan is not required unless the mission has
     changed or the guidance for the plan has changed (such as, Air Force Regulations superseded
     by Air Force Instructions).
     4.3. Change Packages. In lieu of republishing a plan, minor changes can be incorporated
     via change package, which consists of the Letter of Transmittal and replacement Page
     Changes (see paragraph 5.2.4.). Change packages are consecutively numbered as Change 1,
     2, or 3 respectively, and are uploaded by the OPR into TurboDOCS as a separate file or
     Document Version, i. e., Change 1, dtd 10 April 2009. OPRs should include the Change
     Number and Date in the Filename to be used in TurboDOCS, i.e., 10-2 CEMP Change 1_dtd
     10 Apr 09.
5. Determine Format.
     5.1. Format. Use higher headquarters published guidance and directives when provided.
     The 45 SW format will be used when higher headquarters has not specified a format (see
     Attachments 4 thru 13).
     5.2. Page Numbers:
        5.2.1. Roman Numerals. The Plan Summary, Security Instructions, Record of Changes,
        and Table of Contents, are numbered consecutively, centered at the bottom of the page
        using lower case Roman Numerals.
        5.2.2. Arabic Numerals. The basic plan is numbered consecutively at the bottom of the
        page, centered, using Arabic numbers.
        5.2.3. Alpha-Numeric Numbering. Annex, appendix, tab, and exhibit pages are
        numbered sequentially at the bottom of the page, centered, beginning with the Annex
        letter, Appendix number, tab number, exhibit letter, and page number, for example page 1
        of Annex A would be A-1; and page 1 of Annex B, Appendix 1, Tab J, would be B-1-J-1.
        5.2.4. Change Page Numbers. Page changes will have the change number, and the date
        of change in parenthesis (Change 1, 10 Apr 09) centered two lines below the page
        number.
        5.2.5. Blank Pages. Pages intentionally left blank will indicate so by using "THIS
        PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK."
     5.3. Signatures.
        5.3.1. Plan Signature. The wing commander, vice wing commander, group
        commander, or deputy group commander, will sign the Basic Plan, and the Letter of
        Transmittal. Each Annex will have one of these individual’s signature blocks but will not
        be re-signed; include the word "OFFICIAL" above the signature element. In rare cases
        that involve other federal regulations, there may be exceptions to the signature rule.
        5.3.2. Annex Signature. After a plan (new or republished) has been fully coordinated
        and group commander/staff agency/functional signatures are obtained via Staff Summary
45SWI10-401 22 JULY 2010                                                                         7


      Sheet (AFSPC Form 1768), re-signing of individual Annex(s) is not required. In this
      case include the signature element of the 45 SW/CC/CV or group CC/deputy, on the last
      page of the Annex and type the word "OFFICIAL" above the signature element. In rare
      cases that involve other federal regulations, there may be exceptions to the signature rule.
      If tasking is beyond the 45 SW, i.e., not in the 45 SW chain of command, the plan should
      be fully coordinated thru the external agency via Staff Summary Sheet, and signed on the
      last page of the Annex by an official belonging to the external agency acknowledging
      their anticipated participation in the plan.
      5.3.3. Appendices, Tabs, and Exhibits. Signatures are not required unless the signing
      authority is not in the chain of command. (See para 5.3.2).
   5.4. Abbreviations. The first time an abbreviation is used, the abbreviated word or phrase
   will be spelled out; thereafter, the abbreviation may be used alone.
   5.5. Paragraphs. Number paragraphs using Arabic numerals.
      5.5.1. Subparagraphs. Subdivided paragraphs are lettered using subdivisions (a, b, etc.)
      as needed.
      5.5.2. Further Paragraph Subdividing. Designations for further paragraph subdividing
      will be as follows: 1, a, (1), (a), 1, a, (1), and (a), respectively. When formatting a plan,
      A may be used by itself (stand alone), and does not have to be followed by B. Similarly,
      1 may be used stand alone and does not have to be followed by 2.
   5.6. Capitalizing and Underlining.
      5.6.1. References. References to specific annexes and other attachments are typed in
      capital and lower case letters.

6. 45 SW Plan/OPlan Requirements.
   6.1. Minimum Content and Format Requirements. The following paragraphs describe
   the minimum format requirements for a 45 SW Plan/OPlan.
      6.1.1. Letter of Transmittal. This memo introduces the plan and describes conditions
      under which the plan will be implemented. It identifies the OPR, office symbol, and
      phone number. The memo will be signed by the wing commander, vice wing
      commander, group commander, deputy group commander, or his/her technical director,
      (see Attachment 4).
      6.1.2. Cover Page. The cover page will be standard for 45th Space Wing Plans (see

      6.1.4. Basic Plan. The Basic Plan is a detailed description of the overall operations (see
      Attachment 7). The format includes the header, the unit designation, the base name plus
      zip code, and the date of the plan. The 45 SW Plan Number and the Identifying Section
      will be underlined, capitalized, and in larger print than the text. If the plan is classified,
      the classification will be listed on the header and the footer (see guidance for Marking of
      Classified).
      6.1.5. Annexes. The minimum annexes required for 45 SW plans are:
          6.1.5.1. Annex A, Tasked Organizations. This section includes all organizations
          required to support the plan (see Attachment 8). They will be listed in numerical
          order for wing, group, and squadron. The page numbering will begin with A-1.
          6.1.5.2. Annex C, Operations. Provides information concerning plan operations
          and includes tasking references as well as references used to write the plan. The
          overall purpose of the plan and its precise mission will be explained in this annex.
          The page numbering will begin with C-1 (see Attachment 9).
          6.1.5.3. Annex J, Command Relationships. Identifies the relationships between the
          tasked organizations and should include a flow chart or organizational chart. The
          page numbering will begin with J-1 (see Attachment 10). If adding an appendix, use
          Appendix 1 to Annex J (see Attachment 11).
          6.1.5.4. Annex Z, Distribution. Identifies the office symbol of all on-base agencies
          that require a copy of the plan, and the names and addresses of all off-base agencies
          that require a copy of the plan. Includes the number of copies each agency requires.
          The list should include higher headquarters, major commands, and numbered Air
          Forces (mailing address with building number and zip code) with the need-to-know
          (see Attachment 12). The following annex designations are used when required:

7. Administrative Requirements.
   7.1. Security.
      7.1.1. Classification Markings. All Plans/OPlans will be classified according to their
      source documents. Refer to DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, and AFI 31-
      401, Managing the Information Security Program, for the proper classification marking
      of the Plan/OPlan.
      7.1.2. For Official Use Only (FOUO). If required, "For Official Use Only" will be
      identified on the header and the footer. Refer to AFI 37-131, Freedom of Information
      Act Program.
   7.2. Plan Date. Each annex, appendix, and exhibit of a plan must have the same date. The
   original plan date will be located in the upper right-hand corner, one line below the unit
   address. Page changes will have the change number, and date of the change in parenthesis
   (e.g. Change 1, 26 Jan 97).
8. Coordination.
   8.1. Wing Plans. All wing plans will be staffed through 45 SW/XP for concurrence prior to
   Command Section coordination. OPRs must resolve comments prior to Command Section
   coordination.
      8.1.1. Request Inputs. OPRs provide information to tasked agencies and collect their
      written inputs to prepare an initial draft.
   8.2. Coordinate Initial Draft. Send the initial draft to tasked agencies and 45 SW/XPI via
   normal coordination processes for review.
   8.3. Incorporate Inputs into the Final Draft. Incorporate all information into the
   document. This copy will be coordinated with the group commanders and other
   organizations as necessary.
   8.4. Coordinate Final Draft. Review the draft for conflicts and resolve with the OPR.
   Send the final draft to 45 SW/XPI for final review and coordination.
      8.4.1. Staff Summary Sheet. OPRs will coordinate the final copy using AF Form 1768,
      Staff Summary Sheet. It will include: A summary of the document, a request for
      coordination by the affected agencies, and group, squadron, or detachment commander’s
      signature. Rewrites must be coordinated through all affected agencies.
      8.4.2. Final Signature. After all reviews have been accomplished and corrections made,
      POCs of plans requiring the 45 SW/CC or CV signature will forward the coordinated
      staff package to the wing Command Section for signature. POCs of plans that require
      group CC/deputy signature will forward their plan to the group commander’s office.
      After approval, plans will be returned to the POC for distribution.
9. Publishing: Reproduction will be made by the OPR. The Defense Automated Printing
Service is equipped to reproduce both classified and unclassified plans. Use a DAPS PATRICK
5604/37 (REV. 9-99), Printing Requisition Form, to request reproduction.
 10                                                            45SWI10-401 22 JULY 2010


10. Plan Distribution:
   10.1. Final Distribution. Depending on file size, distribution of the signed plan or plan
   change package will be made by the plan OPR, according to Annex Z, using electronic media
   (Compact Disc) or e-mail to the maximum extent practical. An electronic copy of the signed
   plan or plan change package should also be provided to 45 SW/XPI in Microsoft Word
   format for read-only archive in the 45 SW Plans Master Library.
   10.2. Determining Plan Recipients. When distributing a classified plan, ensure the
   receiving agency has a "need-to-know" and can properly store the plan. If a classified plan
   needs to be written, and the OPR does not have an approved storage container, 45 SW/XP
   has an approved safe to store working papers and diskettes. All other plans are sent to all
   affected organizations and 45 SW/XPI.
   10.3. Distributing Classified Plans. An AF Form 310, Document Receipt and Destruction
   Certificate, will be used when mailing a copy to off-base receivers. The form will be
   completed according to Information Management Procedures. Proper procedures for
   wrapping and mailing classified plans are listed in Air Force directives.
   10.4. Adopted Forms:
   AF Form 310, Document Receipt and Destruction Certificate
   AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication
   AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet

Terms
Annex—A document appended to a basic plan or order to make it clearer or to give it further
detail.
Appendix—A subordinate addition to the annex of a plan, which is usually too bulky or full of
details to include in an annex. An appendix is related to a major division or category of data to
be presented.
In-Garrison and Expeditionary Site Plan—The installation level planning accomplished to
support unified and specified command wartime operation plans, as well as MAJCOM
supporting plans. It cuts across all functional support areas in a consolidated view of installation
missions, requirements, capabilities and limitations to plan for actions and resources supporting
war or contingency operations, including deployment activities.
Chain of Command—The succession of commanding officers from a superior to a subordinate
through which command is exercised; also called command channel.
Concept Plan (CONPlan)—An operation plan in an abbreviated format that would require
considerable expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPlan or OPORD. It contains the
CINCs Strategic Concept and those annexes and appendices deemed necessary to complete
planning. Usually does not contain a TPFDD.
Exercise Plan (EXPLAN)—The document published as guidance for a specific exercise.
For Official Use Only (FOUO)—Information that has not been given a security classification
according to an executive order but which may be withheld from the public for one or more
reasons identified in AFI 37-131.
Guidance—Policy, direction, decision, or instructions having the effect of an order when issued
by a higher authority.
Installation Deployment Plan—A document which provides detailed procedures, instructions,
and comprehensive data required to expeditiously deploy personnel and equipment.
Limiting Factor (LIMFAC)—A factor or condition that either temporarily or permanently
impedes mission accomplishment. This limitation has a significant impact on the capability to
perform the wartime mission and has become a wartime constraint.
Need-to-Know—A criterion used in security procedures which requires the custodians of
classified information to establish, prior to disclosure, that the intended recipient must have
access to the information to perform his official duties.
Operation—A military action or the carrying out of a strategic, tactical, service, training, or
administrative military mission; the process of carrying on combat, including movement,
supply, attack, defense, and maneuvers needed to gain objectives of any battle or campaign.
Operation Order (OPORD)—A directive issued by a commander to subordinate commanders
for the purpose of effecting the coordinated execution of an operation.
Operation Plan (OPlan)—A plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be used as a basis
for development of an OPORD. An OPlan identifies the forces and supplies required to execute
the CINCs Strategic Concept and a movement schedule of these resources to the theater of
operations. Forces and supplies are identified in the OPlan TPFDD.
45SWI10-401 22 JULY 2010                                                                       13


Operation Security (OPSEC)—A process of analyzing friendly actions attendant to military
operations and other activities to identify those actions that can be observed by adversary
intelligence systems, determine indicators hostile intelligence systems might obtain that could be
pieced together to derive critical information, or select and execute measures that eliminate or
reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary exploitation.
Plan—The scheme or proposed method for accomplishing a mission or reaching an objective.
Plan Summary—A required element of an operation plan which provides a brief description of
the mission, the general situation, the concept of operations, the major forces required, command
arrangements, and the commander’s appraisal of logistic feasibility.
Strategic Plan—Provides the wing’s vision for the future and strategies and actions to achieve
this vision.
Support—The action of a force, which aids, protects, complements, or sustains another force in
accordance with a directive requiring such action.
Supporting Plan—An operation plan prepared by a supporting commander or subordinate
commander to satisfy the requirements of the supported commander’s plan.
Sustainability—The ability to maintain the necessary level and duration of combat activity to
achieve national objectives.
Tab—A tab is a further subdivision of an appendix to provide clarity of presentation.
