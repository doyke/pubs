1.1. Weather Integration and Exploitation. Exploitation/integration applies to all weather
organizations responsible for delivering environmental information for a military operation.
Weather exploitation units (EU) provide direct or continuing support to a mission set and
determine both environmental threats and effective decision points to inject weather into the
planning and execution process of the mission. This allows for development of courses of action
during the planning process to mitigate these threats. The outcome of these processes is the
delivery of decision-quality environmental information to decision-makers. Decision-quality
environmental threat information requires mission specific thresholds, adjusted for temporal and
spatial resolution, be applied to characterization products. The timing and format of this
information will be coordinated with the end user to ensure its effectiveness in the decision-
making process.
1.2. Exploitation Units.
     1.2.1. EUs will use the Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP) to tailor weather
     products and provide decision-quality environmental information for mission planning and
     execution for their supported unit. EU personnel will understand their unit’s mission and
     tactics, along with characterization unit (CU) capabilities in order to better anticipate, exploit
     and integrate weather information. EU personnel are also responsible for direct interface
     with supervisors of flying (SOF), Air Traffic Control (ATC), Operations Centers, the
     servicing OWS, and other operational users in the supported unit. EU leadership will also
     infuse elements of weather observing, meteorological watch (METWATCH), and resource
     protection roles (e.g., Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP)) into keeping the servicing CU
     informed of current weather. EUs will participate in CU collaboration sessions to focus on
     product fidelity/accuracy with respect to operational thresholds.
     1.2.2. Staff Integration functions. EU leadership will ensure their unit is adequately
     resourced to meet both operational and staff requirements. In addition to leadership and
     management of unit activities, these unit members will also function as a direct interface with
     the supported unit commander and staff, and provide direct support to command, control and
     planning functions. If additional resources are required to perform operational or staff
     functions, EU leadership will submit a request through their supported unit chain of
     command.
        1.2.2.1. All members of the EU (including the Commander/Officer in Charge (OIC),
        Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC), or civilian equivalent(s)) will be position
        qualified on all tasks for their duty positions. OIC/NCOIC/civilian equivalent(s) will be
        position qualified on all unit duty positions.
            1.2.2.1.1. (Added-AMC) AMC Weather Flight OIC and NCOIC will be position
            qualified on all applicable CFETP tasks accomplished by the weather flight. (T-3)
            1.2.2.1.2. (Added-AMC) Exception: The 618 AOC/XOW Director will establish
            duty position requirements for each member of the 618 AOC/XOW. (T-3)
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                           7


      1.2.2.2. Members will use the MEFP to tailor weather products and provide decision-
      quality environmental information for mission planning and execution for their supported
      unit.
   1.2.3. Optimum integration incorporates the continuous feed of information into the
   planning and execution processes. EUs that are fully integrated seamlessly operate with their
   supported unit(s) by operating and training with them to conduct full-spectrum operations
   and provide continuous weather information into the decision-making process.
      1.2.3.1. EUs will develop SOPs to incorporate weather information into the daily
      operations of their supported unit(s).
      1.2.3.2. EUs will develop, conduct and participate in training that incorporates supported
      unit(s) mission and tactics.
   1.2.4. Weather forces supporting Air Force operations will maintain the capability to deploy
   to main (and forward area) operating locations in support of their aligned AF aircraft, unit,
   warfighting weapon systems or as described in their DOC statement.
   1.2.4. (AMC) 618 AOC/XOW personnel postured against 7FVXT UTC are designated as
   deployed in-place and are not required to maintain a capability to deploy in a different UTC.
   Positions are coded with the appropriate “DP” code.
      1.2.4.1. AFW personnel will integrate into warfighting headquarters, Air and Space
      Operations Centers (AOCs), and flying wing/group/squadron mission planning cells to
      enable warfighters to fully exploit weather and space environmental information.
      1.2.4.2. EUs will encourage supported commanders to include weather forces in
      operational exercises to provide combat-related training and gain experience with
      aircrews and ground forces in simulated, yet realistic, wartime environments.
   1.2.5. EUs supporting US Army operations will maintain the capability to deploy to main
   (and forward area) operating locations in support of their aligned warfighting unit or as
   described in their DOC statement.
      1.2.5.1. EUs supporting Army operations will integrate with the intelligence, operations
      and planning cells (i.e., S2, S3, S5) of their aligned warfighting unit.
      1.2.5.2. The supporting weather squadron will provide appropriate weather
      representation to their aligned Army unit and assist the Commander Air Force Forces
      Staff Weather Officer (COMAFFOR SWO) in employing AFW forces supporting Army
      operations, as required.
   1.2.6. Forward-deployed AFW forces supporting military operations will leverage
   environmental characterization information from centralized weather organizations via a
   combination of reachback and distributed operations to provide tailored environmental
   effects information essential to planning and executing land operations.
1.3. Documentation. EU leadership will ensure that information on weather services are
documented in respective supported unit operations plans, contingency plans, memoranda of
understanding, host-tenant support agreements, emergency management plan(s), airfield local
operating procedures, weather support plan or SOPs. MAJCOM Functionals may publish
overarching weather plans, supplements and/or annexes to describe MAJCOM-unique weather

operations requirements, processes or products that address all or part of the documentation
requirement.
1.3. (AMC) AMC weather flights will publish a weather support instruction to consolidate
documentation specified in AFMAN 15-129 Volume 2, Air and Space Weather Operations –
Exploitation. (T-2) AMC/A3AW maintains an installation weather instruction template at
https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/A3A/A3AW/default.aspx that contains required information not
readily documented elsewhere. 618 AOC/XOW documents support in an Operating Instruction.
621 CRW documents support in appropriate pre-deployment and deployment plans. 621 CRW
documentation requirements apply to deployed operations.
     1.3.1. Weather annexes and plans will be reviewed and revised no greater than biennially or
     IAW with host/parent unit procedures if the time is less than biennially. EU leadership will
     initiate an out-of-cycle formal review to accurately reflect operational changes resulting from
     supported unit mission changes, equipment upgrades or significant changes in overarching
     guidance.
     1.3.2. Weather operations information in Operation Plans (OPLANs) annexes will be clearly
     written and agree with other prescribing directives. Where technical terms are necessary,
     ensure they are defined. Normally, weather information included in another document is not
     repeated; a reference will suffice. However, if the customer does not have access to the
     referenced material, include pertinent elements of the information in the annex. Attachments
     and appendices are acceptable methods of documenting information such as Aviation
     Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI) observation criteria and product formats.
     1.3.3. EUs will at a minimum formally document information and procedures pertaining to
     the following when applicable:
     1.3.3. (AMC) Table 1.5 details AMC applicability for formal documentation.
        1.3.3.1. EU Duty Priorities as determined by mission requirements (see examples of duty

  1.3.8. (AMC) EUs will use the forecast techniques and ROTs identified in the servicing
  OWS FRM and Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP) for TAF processes. EUs will only
  use validated ROTs, forecast techniques identified in AFWA TN-98/002 and OWS TTPs in
  the MEFP. EUs will forward requests to use forecast techniques not identified in this
  paragraph to AMC/A3AW for approval. (T-2)
     1.3.8.1. ROTs are locally developed forecasting and product tailoring tools. EUs will
     forward ROTs to their servicing OWS for validation and documentation of forecast
     effectiveness. ROTs under development will be designated as “experimental” in local
     procedures and OWS-maintained FRMs until validated.
     1.3.8.1. (AMC) EUs should provide informational copies of ROT validation requests to
     AMC/A3AW.
     1.3.8.2. To validate a ROT, use it with other forecast tools and techniques for at least one
     season to determine its forecast accuracy. If the ROT is valid and adds value, integrate
     the ROT into unit processes and procedures. Modify and revalidate or discard a ROT
     that cannot be validated.
     1.3.8.3. Servicing OWS submits validated ROTs that may be useful to other units for
     inclusion in the AFWTL.

       1.4.1.2. EU leadership will review installation data pages within 90 days of assignment
       or annually, whichever occurs first; to ensure consistency with supported unit
       requirements. Updated/reviewed installation data pages will have the date of review or
       updated publication date published on the document. EU leadership will inform the CU
       of any changes that occur on the installation to update the installation data page. Any
       support issue between the CU and the EU that cannot be resolved at the appropriate
       subordinate levels through the chain of command will be elevated to the functional higher
       headquarters for resolution.
   1.4.2. Collaboration. CU-EU leadership will emphasize the importance of teamwork, open
   lines of communication, and constructive feedback.
       1.4.2.1. The CU and EU together will:
          1.4.2.1.1. Ensure the timely issuance of WWAs with supported customers.
          1.4.2.1.2. Establish procedures to manage severe weather threats, to include recalling
          of weather personnel.
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                          15


          1.4.2.1.3. CUs will determine mandatory forecast review criteria of severe weather
          events as required. EUs may request reviews for severe weather events that
          negatively influence the effective execution of military operations. The CU is the
          primary OPR for the formal review, and the EU will provide inputs and coordination,
          as required.
          1.4.2.1.3. (AMC) EUs should submit informational copies of requests for forecast
          reviews to HQ AMC/A3AW.
          1.4.2.1.4. Assist the installation commander and disaster preparedness personnel
          providing technical material and/or developing presentations to educate installation
          agencies on the purpose, applicability and operating procedures of the weather watch
          and warning system.
       1.4.2.2. EUs will provide feedback to the CU on the accuracy, timeliness and relevance
       of weather products and information. Route reports of unsatisfactory products or services
       at the lowest levels of operations. Forward all unresolved issues to the CU Operations
       Superintendent and/or Director of Operations through the EUs similar chain of command
       (Operations Superintendent/Director of Operations, etc.).
       1.4.2.3. Limited duty EUs will coordinate weather support for their supported
       organizations during their hours of closure far enough in advance with the servicing CU
       to ensure proper hand off of support. EUs will notify their supporting CU upon closing
       of operations and verify finalization of support arrangements including flight weather
       briefings.
       1.4.2.4. Limited duty EUs will notify their servicing CU when resuming operations at the
       beginning of their operational duty day. EUs will use this contact to gain environmental
       situational awareness of current and forecast conditions, discuss any active/imminent
       resource protection products and receive handover of flight briefing responsibility.
       1.4.2.5. EU leadership will forward updated changes in documented support to their
       servicing CU, as required. If these updates drive further changes to CU-EU operations,
       prior coordination between CU-EU leadership is mandatory. Agreed upon changes will
       be documented on the installation data page.
       1.4.2.6. EUs will notify the CU Operations Superintendent or regional zone OIC when
       temporary changes to duty hours occur (e.g., Family Day, Goal Day, other
       closures/extensions). This notification will be made no later than 24 hours in advance of
       the closure to allow the CU to reallocate its resources, as required.
       1.4.2.7. EUs will review the FRM for the installation hosted electronically by the CU at
       least annually. Provide updates (e.g., new airfield weather sensors, local mission types)
       to allow the CU to update the installation’s electronic FRM, as required.
1.5. Expeditionary Operations. Expeditionary operations outlined below are for units that are
preparing for new or emerging requirements (e.g., non-sustainment operations) and will deploy
with their supported unit. Individual weather personnel will deploy IAW pre-deployment
checklists and procedures outlined by their supported unit.
   1.5.1. Pre-deployment Activities. Prior to deployment, weather organizations will follow
   procedures outlined in AFI 15-127, Air Force Weather Training and the following:
 16                                           AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014


       1.5.1.1. Collect Go/No-Go thresholds for the deployed location using deployed mission
       and operational requirements, rules of engagement, and theater specific environmental
       impacts of the supported unit.
       1.5.1.2. Participate in pre-deployment planning to ensure theater-specific environmental
       impacts are factored into supported unit deployment activities.
       1.5.1.3. Develop tactical SOPs that incorporate major functions of daily supported
       activities (e.g., duty priorities, manual observing and augmentation of automated
       sensors). Duty priorities should be coordinated with the supported unit. Duty priorities
       in Table 1.2 are provided as an example.

Table 1.2. Example Duty Priorities for Deployed/Expeditionary EUs
 Wartime defense of the duty site/location, including CBRNE defense measures.
 Wartime support of the principal staff elements.
 Aircraft/ground emergencies.
 PMSV calls.
 Prepare and disseminate Weather Watches/Warnings/Advisories.
 Augment AMOS/Take and record manual surface weather observations.
 Maintain/restore primary communications.
 Prepare/issue Mission Weather Products.
 Other briefings and staff functions.
 Note: Based on the judgment of the OIC, NCOIC, or the EU technician on duty, these
 priorities may be changed, especially if there is danger to life or property.


   1.5.2. Deployed equipment.
       1.5.2.1. EUs will deploy with unit type code (UTC) tasked equipment and weapons.
       Requests for additional equipment will be submitted through MAJCOM Functional
       channels.
       1.5.2.2. Inventory tasked equipment before deployment and upon arrival.
   1.5.3. EU members deploying to a contingency theater will follow reporting instructions
   listed on their orders, and other applicable guidance provided by the Joint Meteorological and
   Oceanographic Officer (JMO) Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Letter of
   Instruction (LOI) or Expeditionary Weather Squadron/ Expeditionary Operations Support
   Squadron.
1.6. Support Assistance Request (SAR).
   1.6.1. AF weather organizations and other supported units will submit a SAR when
   requesting specialized terrestrial, space, or climatological services from supporting weather
   organizations (e.g., AFWA, 14 WS), or specialized theater-level support from servicing
   OWSs for their respective AOR.
   1.6.2. Organizations will submit requests for unclassified support directly to the appropriate
   supporting weather organizations or OWS using the SAR function on the applicable web
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                         17


   page. Organizations may also submit requests for unclassified support via telephone, fax, or
   e-mail when the applicable web page is not available.
   1.6.3. Organizations will submit requests for classified support using the SAR function on
   Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) or other classified dissemination
   systems. Organizations may also submit requests for classified support via secure telephone,
   fax, or e-mail when the applicable web page is not available.
   1.6.4. Organizations must provide as much detail as possible in order to clearly state the
   requirement. If there is a problem in providing the support, the supporting weather
   organization or OWS will contact the requestor to clarify the requirement and to discuss
   alternatives.
   1.6.4. (AMC) EU leadership will notify AMC/A3AW whenever a request for operational
   and/or theater-level support is denied by the supporting weather organization. (T-2)
   1.6.5. To determine the servicing OWS in an AOR, refer to Air Force Visual Aid (AFVA)
   15-136, AF Weather OWS AORs-CONUS and AFVA 15-137, AF Weather OWS AORs -
   OCONUS available on the Air Force Departmental Publishing Office (AFDPO) web site
   (i.e., Air Force e-Publishing website).
   1.6.6. Organizations may submit SARs for recurring, infrequent or one-time support. If the
   SAR is for support that must be delivered under strict time constraints, organizations will
   submit the SAR far enough in advance to allow the supporting weather organization or OWS
   to work the request effectively. For recurring support, organizations may develop a "pre-
   positioned" SAR with the appropriate supporting weather organization or OWS that may be
   activated short-notice by telephone, fax, or e-mail.
   1.6.7. EUs will direct agencies needing specialized support to the appropriate supporting
   weather organizations or OWS and guide them through the SAR process to make their
   request.
1.7. KQ Identifiers. AFWA, acting on behalf of all the United States military services, assigns
special use ICAO identifiers beginning with “KQ”, for use by deployed units supporting real-
world contingencies; deployed/in-garrison units providing support during exercises; classified
operating locations; and units that have requested, but not yet received a permanent location
identifier.
   1.7.1. Exploitation Units will:
       1.7.1.1. Request KQ IDs through the lead METOC element to HQ AFWA’s Current
       Operations Division:
          1.7.1.1.1. During normal duty hours (non-holiday weekdays 0700L-1600L, U.S.
          Central Time): Non-secure: DSN (312) 271-5984 or 272-3162 / Commercial (402)
          294-5984 or 232-3162, or e-mail afwakq@offutt.af.mil Secure: DSN (312) 272-
          4390, or e-mail AFWAOPS@offutt.af.smil.mil.
          1.7.1.1.2. During non-duty hours (after 1600L/before 0700L, U.S. Central Time,
          weekends and holidays) or in case of emergency: Non-secure: e-mail
          afwaops@afwa.af.mil       Secure:    DSN     (312)    272-4390,   or     e-mail
          AFWAOPS@offutt.af.smil.mil.
 18                                            AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014


          1.7.1.1.3. All requests for KQ IDs should be made as far in advance as possible to
          ensure timely issuance.
          1.7.1.1.4. For peacetime KQ identifier requests, the Air Force lead METOC element
          is normally the MAJCOM Functional Manager, the Navy lead METOC element for
          KQ requests is normally Fleet Numerical METOC Center (FNMOC), and the Marine
          Corps lead element is the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) SWO. For wartime and
          contingency operations, the lead METOC element is the Senior METOC Officer
          (SMO) responsible for establishing the weather force for the particular contingency.
          The SMO may designate a Joint METOC Officer (JMO) to execute this
          responsibility. Requestors, through the lead METOC element or SMO/JMO, will
          provide the following information:
              1.7.1.1.4.1. Start and stop dates (if known).
              1.7.1.1.4.2. Name, organizations, e-mail address, and DSN/commercial phone
              number of POC.
              1.7.1.1.4.3. Classification of location and supported operation or exercise.
              1.7.1.1.4.4. Name of exercise, test, contingency, etc.
              1.7.1.1.4.5. Releasability (for non-DoD use or handled as “sensitive” non-
              releasable).
              1.7.1.1.4.6. Location name, latitude, longitude, and elevation; must specify
              whether in degrees/minutes/feet or degrees/decimal/meters. Note: AFWA will
              convert all lat/lon readings into degrees/minutes.
              1.7.1.1.4.7. Runway headings for airfield primary runways (if available).
              1.7.1.1.4.8. Observation equipment to be used.
              1.7.1.1.4.9. Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) coordinates (if known).
              1.7.1.1.4.10. World Meteorological Organization number/block station number
              (if assigned).
   1.7.2. Once this information is provided, the KQ ID manager will issue a new KQ ID. If
   mission and time constraints limit the amount of information the requestor can provide or the
   ability to submit the request through the lead METOC element, the KQ ID manager will
   issue a KQ ID and follow up with the POC when time permits.
   1.7.3. Once the KQ ID is no longer required, the requestor will contact the KQ ID manager
   and the lead METOC element to discontinue the use of identifier.
   1.7.4. Classified KQ Compromise. Once a classified KQ ID compromise is identified, the
   individual or organization who discovered the compromise will immediately notify the
   AFWA KQ ID manager through the operations center, using appropriate security and
   communication measures.
1.8. Coordinated Weather Operations. Weather organizations must coordinate weather
information for missions involving more than one unit or service. Coordinated weather
operations ensure decision-makers at every level receive consistent and relevant weather
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                                 19


information. It also ensures a comprehensive and standardized set of decision-grade weather
information is used and available across all command levels.
      1.8.1. When two or more military units operate together and share the same
      airspace/battlespace (e.g., air refueling routes, military operating areas, drop zones), a lead
      weather unit (LWU) will be identified using the rules in Table 1.3. as a guide to coordinate
      overall weather services for the supported mission(s). In some instances, the LWU for a
      given supported mission is identified in an applicable joint/Air Force letter of instruction,
      operations plan (OPLAN) or execution order(EXORD). In the absence of such guidance, the
      EU supporting the mission’s command and control (C2) element is the LWU.
      1.8.2. Control MWPs (CMWP) are issued by LWUs for common operations area(s) used by
      multiple units/missions operating together in a shared airspace/battlespace. Supporting EUs
      will not deviate from the mission-critical weather thresholds specified in CMWPs without
      prior coordination with the responsible LWU.
      1.8.3. The OWS responsible for a geographic region or COCOM AOR is responsible for
      developing the suite of Operational/Theater-scale products specified in AFMAN 15-129
      Volume 1 for its AOR. The OWS will provide model output and manually generated
      forecast products for military operating areas (e.g., air refueling routes, training area/ranges,
      drop zones) for use by LWUs/EUs supporting two or more units operating together in a
      shared airspace/battlespace.

         1.8.3.1.1. Coordinate with all EUs/CUs involved in the supported mission(s) to
         identify and obtain point of contact (POC) information (e.g., secure/non-secure
         telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses) for each organization.
         1.8.3.1.1. (AMC) Attachment 6 of this supplement identifies supporting weather
         units for real-world and training AR operations.
      1.8.3.2. Collect information to define supported mission schedule(s), types (e.g., aerial
      refueling, air drops, combat sorties and ground tactics), weapon systems and critical
      weather thresholds from the supported C2 element and supporting EU/CU POCs.
      1.8.3.2. (AMC) The Military Training Routes (AP/1B) Flight Information Publication
      should be used to obtain detailed information on military training areas/routes and AR
      tracks, anchors, coordinates, and refueling altitudes.
      1.8.3.3. Determine MWP, data and service requirements for the supported mission(s).
      1.8.3.3. (AMC) AMC LWU CMWPs for AR tracks/areas will be made for weather
      phenomena 5,000 feet above/below the AR track/area flight level. CMWPs will be valid
      for 30 minutes before entering the AR track/area to 1 hour after exiting. (T-2)
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                         21


      1.8.3.4. Coordinate with the supporting OWS(s)/CU(s) to request any specialized
      forecast products (e.g., JOAF, charts) needed to develop the CMWP, as required.
      1.8.3.5. Determine the CMWP format (e.g., text, graphics), content, delivery
      method/times and amendment criteria. See Attachment 5 for guidance on preparing
      alphanumeric CMWPs.
      1.8.3.6. Coordinate CMWP issue times and delivery methods with the supported C2
      element and supporting EUs/CUs involved in the mission(s).
      1.8.3.7. Use all applicable supporting OWS/CU forecast products and weather data to
      develop CMWPs for supported missions.
      1.8.3.8. Use the MEFP to predict, tailor, integrate and issue CMWPs for supported
      missions.
      1.8.3.9. Coordinate with all supporting EUs and OWSs/CUs to MISSIONWATCH the
      CMWP and amend it as required based on mission critical weather thresholds.
   1.8.4. Integrated Flight Management (IFM) Missions. IFM is a Mobility Air Force (MAF)
   core process designed to provide dynamic, proactive mission management and near real-time
   C2.     Flight Managers (FMs) act as virtual crewmembers, using electronic flight
   planning/filing, flight following, maintenance, transportation and weather resources to
   centrally plan and aid aircrews in the execution of MAF sorties/missions. Fused flight
   management information, shared situational awareness, collaborative decision making and
   dynamic planning/adjustment enable FMs to act as the primary point-of-contact for real-time
   weather operations for mobility forces around the world.
      1.8.4.1. FMs interact with weather agencies much as the flying crewmembers do. FMs
      review en route hazards, takeoff, arrival and alternate weather, SIGMETs, etc., and often
      act as the conduit to pass weather information (including the MWP) to the flying
      crewmembers.
      1.8.4.2. Weather operations for IFM missions. Table 1.4 shows the lead weather unit
      responsible for producing the CMWP and servicing the C2 agency and aircrew for IFM
      missions.

     1.8.4.3. Specific duties and responsibilities of the PACAF and USAFE weather units
     providing weather information to theater AOC Air Mobility Division-controlled IFM
     missions will be documented in MAJCOM level instructions.
  1.8.5. (Added-AMC) AMC CMWP Procedures.
     1.8.5.1. (Added-AMC) When operating as LWU AMC EUs will:
         1.8.5.1.1. (Added-AMC) Utilize the AFW-WEBS MOAF tool as the primary
         method of forecasting all weather parameters. Utilize CU FITL hazard charts to
         identify turbulence, icing, and thunderstorms until this information is incorporated
         into the MOAF tool. (T-2)
         1.8.5.1.2. (Added-AMC) Use data that provides greater spatial or temporal
         resolution (satellite, skew-ts, etc.) to assist in tailoring CMWPs. (T-2)
             1.8.5.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) Coordination and dissemination of CMWPs to
             1WXG and other AMC units is not required if the forecast does not deviate from
             the MOAF tool or CU hazards. In addition, coordination and dissemination to
             1WXG and other AMC units is not required when the forecast deviates from the
             MOAF tool or CU hazards without crossing a category in the enroute section of
             Table 2.5.1. (T-2)
             1.8.5.1.2.2. (Added-AMC) Coordinate with all supporting weather units when
             these products result in a forecast that deviates from the MOAF tool or CU
             hazards by a category identified in the enroute section of Table 2.5.1. (T-2)
         1.8.5.1.3. (Added-AMC) Coordination and dissemination of the CMWP is required
         in all other cases. (T-2)
         1.8.5.1.4. (Added-AMC) MISSIONWATCH the CMWP and amend it as required
         based on mission critical weather thresholds identified in the enroute section of Table
         2.5.1. Coordinate all amendments with supporting EUs and CUs. (T-2)
     1.8.5.2. (Added-AMC) When operating as the supporting weather unit AMC EUs will:
         1.8.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) Use the LWU provided CMWP. (T-2)
         1.8.5.2.2. (Added-AMC) In the absence of a LWU-provided CMWP, use the
         MOAF tool/CU Hazards. (T-2)
         1.8.5.2.3. (Added-AMC) MISSIONWATCH the CMWP and coordinate with the
         LWU to amend it as required based on mission critical weather thresholds identified
         in the enroute section of Table 2.5.1. (T-2)
1.9. COOP.
  1.9.1. General. AF weather organizations will be prepared to continue uninterrupted
  mission-essential functions during a national security emergency or other disruptive
  conditions, such as major equipment/communications outages or evacuations. To ensure
  continuity of operations during these situations, organizations will develop processes to use
  alternate equipment/systems, operate from alternate locations or arrange transfer of critical
  functions to other organizations. Organizations aligned to provide continuity of operations
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                         23


  support for another unit must be capable of providing that support and should be fully
  prepared to assume the responsibility within one hour of initiation.
  1.9.2. Exploitation Unit COOP. EUs at main operating locations (garrison operations) will
  establish an AOL to continue providing mission-essential functions to parent/host unit
  activities. EUs at expeditionary locations will establish AOL procedures as quickly as the
  tactical situation permits. EU leaders will coordinate with supported agencies to select an
  appropriate location and secure the needed communications and other specified resource
  requirements. At a minimum, EUs will establish communication from the AOL with the
  local ATC facility, command post, primary installation customers, and the supporting CU.
  See AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations for applicable observing duties at a
  back-up location.
     1.9.2.1. EUs at main operating locations will develop COOP SOPs for the AOL. In
     addition to SOPs, EUs should include AOL activities in a supoprted unit COOP or
     emergency manangement plan(s). EUs at expeditionary locations will develop these
     procedures as the tactical situation permits.
     1.9.2.2. All personnel will be task certified to operate at the AOL.
     1.9.2.3. EUs will notify the supporting CU when moving to the AOL. The EU will
     provide the OWS temporary telephone numbers and any changes in the weather warning
     and advisory notification procedures.
     1.9.2.4. At a minimum, all position-qualified EU personnel will exercise AOL operations
     annually. Real world events meet this requirement if properly evaluated and documented,
     to include lessons learned. EUs at expeditionary locations in steady state or peacekeeping
     operations should exercise AOL operations more frequently to ensure proficiency
     following personnel rotations.
  1.9.3. (Added) (AMC) AMC Weather COOP Exercises. AMC conducts weather COOP
  exercises to maintain the capability to support AMC flying operations.
     1.9.3.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A3AW establishes guidelines and Special
     Instructions (SPINS) outlining the functions and capabilities that are exercised each
     month (e.g. GDSS availability, FMQ-19 outages, AOL ops, etc.).
     1.9.3.2. (Added-AMC) COOP exercises will be conducted on the second
     Wednesday/Thursday of each month for a duration of 48 hours. Deviations from this
     schedule or participation reclamas will be coordinated through AMC/A3AW for prior
     approval. Reclamas must originate from SQ/CC level or above NLT 2 days prior to the
     start of the exercise. (T-2)

                                          Chapter 2

                          MISSION INTEGRATION FUNCTION

2.1. Mission Integration Function. Mission integration requires gaining an in-depth
understanding of supported mission platforms, equipment, and systems capabilities/sensitivities
as well as mission processes (e.g., ORM, COP, tactics, etc.) in order to reliably inject timely,
accurate, and relevant environmental information at every decision point in the mission planning
and execution process in an effort to optimize mission success.
2.2. Mission Weather Products (MWP). MWPs fuse theater scale products with local mission
requirements enabling the direct inject of weather impacts into warfighter planning and/or
execution. MWPs are “living documents” and any/all feedback will be applied to internal
MISSIONWATCH/METWATCH processes to enhance training, forecast proficiency, and
product accuracy. MWPs include flight weather briefings, Intelligence Preparation of the
Operational Environment (IPOE) products, mission planning briefs, environmental inputs to
mission analysis, environmental staff estimates, and any other weather product prepared to meet
the needs of a supported unit. MWPs are primarily developed by EUs utilizing the MEFP.
   2.2.1. EU leadership will ensure environmental information is integrated into all phases of
   supported operations by developing, documenting, and applying the following procedures:
       2.2.1.1. Identify and document critical points in each phase of the operation cycle (i.e.,
       assessment, planning, execution, military decision-making process (MDMP), IPOE) and
       exploit opportunities to provide decision- makers with actionable environmental
       information at these points.
       2.2.1.2. Use information obtained from supported units or derived from authoritative
       sources such as AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and Regulations, technical orders, 11-series
       AFI Volume 3s on specific Aircraft Operations Procedures, AFI 11-202V3, General
       Flight Rules and AR 95-1, Flight Regulations including any supplements to:
           2.2.1.2.1. Identify critical (Go/No-Go) mission-limiting environmental thresholds
           applicable to supported unit operations. EU leadership will develop a logical,
           repeatable process to ensure the MEFP flexibly responds to temporary restrictions,
           changes to rules of engagement, and other transitory mission-limiting environmental
           factors.
           2.2.1.2.2. Tailor MWPs to include forecasts for all critical Go/No-Go mission
           limiting environmental thresholds applicable to supported unit operations.
           2.2.1.2.3. (Added-AMC) AMC units will use conditions in Table 2.5.1 as the
           mission-limiting environmental conditions if applicable. If additional mission
           limiting environmental conditions/thresholds are defined, include the authoritative
           source by identifying applicable flying operations instructions and technical orders
           applicable to supported airframes. (T-2)
       2.2.1.3. Use access to locally available command and control (C2)/mission planning
       systems and integrate into supported unit(s) to the maximum extent possible (Personnel
       TEMPO (PERSTEMPO) and Operational TEMPO (OPSTEMPO) permitting). This will
       be done in order to:
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                           25


          2.2.1.3.1. Collect relevant information about mission planning and execution.
          2.2.1.3.2. Provide timely, accurate, and relevant environmental information for
          planning and execution.
          2.2.1.3.3. Obtain feedback from users on forecast and observed environmental
          conditions applicable to their respective missions.
2.3. Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP). The MEFP is an organized and systematic
process to apply environmental characterizations and provide decision-quality environmental
information to mitigate risks and exploit asymmetric capabilities in the MDMP. The MEFP will
specify how to apply environmental characterizations to mitigate mission limitations and meet
operational requirements.       EUs will develop processes and procedures to establish
meteorological situational awareness and apply environmental characterizations for the
parent/host unit’s decision cycle. The end result of the MEFP is a MWP.
   2.3.1. The MEFP is a continuous cycle that adapts as supported unit needs change. EUs will
   develop internal processes to improve the MEFP based on feedback from the supported unit.
   2.3.2. The complete MEFP will be detailed in SOPs, checklists, flowcharts or other decision
   aids.
   2.3.3. The MEFP consists of two primary components, Administrative and Operational:
       2.3.3.1. Administrative Process. These are steps within the MEFP which will be
       accomplished by EU leadership to maximize the effectiveness of military operations.
       These steps will be reviewed annually. Table 2.1 details administrative processes.
          2.3.3.1.1. The format, timing and dissemination of the MWP from the MEFP will be
          driven by supported unit(s) requirements. EUs will coordinate with the supported
          unit(s) to determine the content and format to ensure it contains decision-grade
          information applicable to the mission.
          2.3.3.1.2. EUs may use GO/NO-GO products to convey environmental information.
          These products are effective in the planning and allocation phases of an operational
          decision cycle and easily convey information to multiple users.
          2.3.3.1.3. Enterprise-sustained software programs that present the forecast in a
          format highlighting direct impacts to the customer (e.g., Integrated Weather Effects
          Decision Aid (IWEDA), Target Acquisition Weather Software (TAWS)) may be used
          in the operational decision cycle and should be specific to a particular mission.
          Software programs not sustained and/or maintained by accredited organizations will
          not be used.
          2.3.3.1.4. EUs will apply supported unit weather sensitivities and requirements to
          tailor weather products to meet operational needs as specified by supported unit
          activities with an environmental impact (e.g., flight ops, transportation, maintenance,
          civil engineering, logistics activities).

Table 2.1. MEFP Administrative Processes
   1. Define Weather Thresholds

          a. Identify critical “Go/No-Go” terrestrial and space weather threshold values (i.e.,
             airframe, mission types, weapon systems, decision timelines).
          b. Identify critical resource protection thresholds (e.g., maintenance, security forces,
             logistics, emergency response).
          c. Know where these parameters are applied (e.g., airfields, ranges, DZs, ARs, low-
             fly routes).
          d. Identify training requirements to ensure all assigned weather Airmen are able to
             mitigate mission-impacting environmental hazards.

   2. Attain and Maintain Situational Awareness

          a. Identify logical process for obtaining situational awareness to identify trends and
             characterization of the atmosphere to others (e.g., shift change, shift duty
             checklist).

          b. Leverage characterization products from DoD, U.S. Government (USG) and
             coalition sources. Utilize characterization products from academic or commercial
             sources only when suitable DoD, USG, or coalition products are unavailable.

          c. Determine best products to use (primary and back-up) for each step including
             purpose of the product utilized and value to the MEFP (e.g., ROTs, climatology,
             space, topography).

          d. Include CU collaboration and communications.

          e. Include review of centrally and/or locally established C2 systems (e.g., Global
             Decision Support System (GDSS), unit flying schedules).

   3. Coordinate Operations

          a. Identify times, criteria, and delivery format of environmental information for
             established supported units (e.g., LAN/Web Page, mass briefing, flight weather
             briefing, crisis action briefing).

          b. Provide or arrange for support for units when away from home station.

          c. Request special terrestrial, climatic, and space weather products via SAR, if
             required.
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                         27


  4. Mission Verification/MISSIONWATCH

        a. Determine parameters, timelines, and critical thresholds for MISSIONWATCH.

        b. Standardize mission/products utilized in order to report MWP Verification
           (MWPVER) in accordance with MAJCOM and AF guidance.

        c. Identify products, frequency, and communication in the MISSIONWATCH
           process.

        d. Establish parameters for MWP reviews and review requests from CUs.

        e. Develop feedback performance mechanisms to incorporate seasonal training or
           specific forecast parameter improvement.



     2.3.3.2. Operational Process. This is the executable phase of the MEFP. Table 2.2
     details operational processes.
        2.3.3.2.1. EUs will define a methodology to incorporate characterization products,
        forecasting techniques, and a logical, verifiable process (the MEFP) to conduct
        weather operations. The process will identify data sources, document forecast
        methods and describe methods of obtaining weather situational awareness.
        2.3.3.2.2. EUs will ensure all processes and procedures for meteorological
        information, and refining weather products are first evaluated from the servicing CU,
        government sources, educational sources, then non-government civilian sources in
        that order. AFWA TN-98/002, Meteorological Techniques, will be incorporated into
        the MEFP until replaced with a set of centrally-managed weather techniques and
        procedures optimized for EUs.
        2.3.3.2.3. CUs are responsible for providing visualization products and forecast
        reasoning that can be used by EUs to quickly ascertain the state of the atmosphere.
        EUs will limit analysis efforts to mission-scale effects along mission routes and
        operating areas (e.g. terrain influences) to refine characterization products. EUs will
        not re-characterize the environment at hemispheric or synoptic scales.
           2.3.3.2.3.1. EUs will use CU-issued graphical and alphanumeric analysis and
           forecast products, TAFs, Watches, Warnings (WW), and Forecast Weather
           Advisories (FWA) in developing the MWP, as well as for updating supported
           unit(s) decision-makers on environmental impacts to operations.
           2.3.3.2.3.2. EUs will discuss potential changes to characterization products with
           their servicing CU when significant disagreements exist or the need to amend
           products or issue warnings that have not been issued or amended. The CU will
           have final issue authority.
           2.3.3.2.3.3. EUs will alert the CU to developing situations not coded in
           meteorological reports that potentially drive amendments to forecast products
 28                                               AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014


               from the CU or impact flight safety.
               2.3.3.2.3.4. EUs will maintain consistency with Joint METOC Coordination Cell
               (JMCC)/Joint METOC Coordination Office (JMCO) guidance during
               joint/combined operations, as required.

             observations).
          c. Apply specific forecast techniques (e.g., icing, turbulence, contrails, rules of thumb).
          d. Integrate geographic, terrain, and vegetation influences on the weather and the mission.
          e. Review space weather conditions and effects on the mission.
          f.   Generate forecast in proper format employing critical “Go/No-Go” thresholds. Generate
               Tactical Decision Aid (TDA) output, as required.
          g. Evaluate product for accuracy and disseminate in accordance with established guidelines
             (e.g., C2 system, LAN/Web Page) to appropriate customers, decision-makers, and other
             weather units.
          h. Retain MWPs IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule and AFI 33-364, Records
             Disposition - Procedures and Responsibilities.
   4. MISSIONWATCH/Mission Verification
          a. Conduct MISSIONWATCH utilizing real-time weather products at established intervals.
          b.    If capability exists, communicate with established POC if thresholds cross critical
               “Go/No-Go” parameters.
          c. Gather feedback from customers and review weather products as necessary to verify
             MWP.
          d. Develop forecast review based on established guidelines if necessary.

2.4. Flight Weather Briefings (FWB).
   2.4.1. Weather units preparing and presenting FWBs will:
      2.4.1.1. Use AF-approved briefing systems (GDSS, Flight Weather Briefer, etc.), DD
      Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing, MAJCOM form, computerized equivalent, or
      verbal briefings as the standard tool for delivering flight weather briefings. DD Form
      175-1, Flight Weather Briefing will be accomplished IAW procedures outlined in
      Attachment 2 of this manual. Technicians presenting flight weather briefings will focus
      on customer needs and tailor briefings to the mission. At a minimum, briefings will
      include the following:
          2.4.1.1.1. General meteorological situation for the mission area.
          2.4.1.1.2. Current and forecast weather (including flight hazards and Significant
          Meteorological Information (SIGMETs)/ Airmen's Meteorological Information
          (AIRMETs)) for takeoff.
          2.4.1.1.3. Forecasted en route weather (including flight hazards and
          SIGMETs/AIRMETs). Note: At a minimum, brief flight hazards within 25 miles
          either side of the route and within 5,000 feet above and below the planned flight
          level.
          2.4.1.1.4. Forecast conditions at destinations and alternate airfields. Note: At a
          minimum, brief destination/alternate hazards within a 100 mile radius of the airfield
          and from the surface to 5,000 feet above the planned flight level for take-off and
          landing.
      2.4.1.2. Evaluate, interpret, and apply the contents from watches, warnings, advisories
      and forecasts. Relay the complete text of weather watches, warnings, and advisories for
      departure location, destination(s), and alternate airfield(s).
      2.4.1.2. (AMC) AMC units providing weather briefings more than 2 hours prior to
      scheduled departure will include all currently issued/valid WWAs and a remark to
      contact the briefer or appropriate local agency for the most current watches, warnings,
      and advisories prior to departure. (T-2)
      2.4.1.3. Use the term “thunderstorms” rather than “cumulonimbus” or “CBs” when
      briefing aircrews. Standard aerial coverage definitions/percentages for thunderstorm
      areas are covered in AFMAN 15-129 Volume 1, Air and Space Weather Operations-
      Characterization.
      2.4.1.4. Request aircrews provide PIREPs during takeoff/landing, and en route, and
      indicate the means of providing them (i.e., PMSV, ATC, phone patch).
      2.4.1.5. Have paper or electronic copy of current applicable Flight Information
      Publication (FLIPs) and other flight weather briefing references listed in Table 2.3
 30                                           AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014

      2.4.1.6. Give the briefing to the aircrew and retain a duplicate copy, in either electronic
      or paper hardcopy format in unit files. The briefing may also be sent to the aircrew via
      DoD e-mail, fax, or posted to a web page.
      2.4.1.7. Develop MISSIONWATCH procedures to include amend and update criteria.
      2.4.1.7. (AMC) As a minimum, AMC units will MISSIONWATCH applicable elements
      of Table 2.5.1. (T-2)
   2.4.2. Transient Aircrews. There may be cases that result in aircrews transiting or staging
   through an airfield without receiving weather information from their supporting EU. EUs
   will employ the “provide or arrange for” concept when faced with requests from transient
   aircrews. IAW duty priorities, EUs will provide a briefing or update an existing briefing
   form for transient aircrews. If an EU is unable to provide a transient aircrew a FWB or
   update an existing briefing, then the EU will:
      2.4.2.1. Direct the aircrew to a dedicated web-based briefing terminal or access to a
      computer to allow aircrews to self-brief or schedule a FWB from the supporting CU.
      2.4.2.2. Provide telephone contact information for the servicing OWS.
      2.4.2.3. Under no circumstances will an EU deny assistance to an aircrew seeking a FWB.
2.5. Provide or Arrange for Support.
   2.5.1. EUs are the primary source of tailored weather information for their supported unit(s).
   When mission activities occur, away from the main operating location, EUs retain
   responsibility to determine the most effective means of ensuring their units receive mission
   execution weather information.
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                              31


       2.5.1.1. When the capability exists, EUs will provide MWPs for their supported unit(s)
       assets transiting another location by reachback to the main operating location or
       deploying with the supported unit(s).
       2.5.1.2. EUs that cannot provide MWPs for supported unit(s) missions transiting or
       staging from another location must arrange support by any of the following means:
          2.5.1.2.1. Request assistance from the EU at the transient or staged location.
          2.5.1.2.2. Request assistance from the CU servicing the transient or staged operating
          location. (Example: EU enters mission data into the servicing CU’s briefing system
          (e.g., Program Generation Server/Scheduler (PGS/S), GDSS) and relays contact
          information and briefing number assigned by the briefing system to the aircrew).
          2.5.1.2.3. If follow-on mission data is not known at execution from home station,
          provide the appropriate CU web site or telephone information to the departing aircrew
          (e.g., in an off-station cross country training mission staging from another airfield, the
          EU technicians provide flight briefing cell contact numbers for the CU servicing the
          staged airfield).
   2.5.2. EU Availability. EUs will have personnel on duty when their supported unit is
   performing their primary operation, duty, or mission and/or when ATC is open and no
   automated observing system capability exists.
       2.5.2.1. EUs are not required to be on duty when ATC is closed, unless SWAP has been
       implemented and it is necessary to provide the eyes forward function, or to supplement
       for tornadic activity IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations. The
       servicing CU will provide FWB support to flights conducted outside normal organization
       operations when ATC is closed and EU personnel are unavailable.
       2.5.2.2. EUs will enter a FWB request via the servicing CU web page when the
       supported unit provides advance notification of intent to conduct operations, and the EU
       is unable to provide MWPs.
       2.5.2.3. EUs will coordinate requests for briefing support with the servicing CU on larger
       flying operations when the EU cannot provide MWPs to the supported unit(s) due to
       manning levels or temporary duty commitments.
   2.5.3. Aero Club Activities. EUs and CUs will provide flight weather briefings to Aero Club
   members performing official Air Force operational duties (i.e. Civil Air Patrol and Initial
   Flying Training Programs). EUs will provide or arrange briefings when such Aero Club
   flights are in a transient status through the appropriate CU or Flight Service Station. EUs
   will not remain open on weekends or times outside normal ATC published operating hours to
   provide briefings for routine Aero Club flying activities. EUs will advise Aero Club
   members performing official flight duties of the CU web page request process and self-
   briefing capabilities.
2.6. Flight Weather Briefing Documentation and Retention. All FWBs, regardless of
delivery format, will be documented, maintained, and retained IAW the AF Records Disposition
Schedule and AFI 33-364, Records Disposition - Procedures and Responsibilities. Maintain a
record copy of the following mandatory items:
   2.6.1. Briefing time.

2.7. Web-Based Aircrew Briefings.
   2.7.1. Weather organizations will publish and provide access information and procedures to
   supported flying units for computer/web-based briefing applications. Procedures will
   address how aircrews request/schedule a weather briefing and include contact information for
   clarification and follow-up. When the capability exists, this service will be provided by an
   Air Force web enterprise service.
   2.7.2. CUs will use web-based briefing applications to:
        2.7.2.1. Provide flight weather briefings to aircrews or EUs requesting briefings for
        aircrews transiting their AOR.
        2.7.2.2. Provide flight weather briefing services to Air National Guard, Army National
        Guard, Air Force Reserve, and Army Reserve units without a collocated or designated
        weather support organization.

2.8. Air Mobility Command Weather Briefings. The 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW is the weather
element for all AMC-gained missions. These missions receive AMC-unique weather packages
embedded in flight papers provided to the aircrews.
    2.8.1. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW will:
        2.8.1.1. Provide all mission weather packages and threat assessments for AMC IFM
        missions under 618 AOC (TACC) command and control. (NOTE: IAW AFI 11-207,
        Combat Aircraft Delivery, all CORONET tanker support missions are under 618 AOC
        (TACC) command and control.) (EXCEPTIONS: Very Important Person Special Airlift
        Mission (VIPSAM) and USSTRATCOM-tasked (TF-294) missions are supported by
        local weather flights IAW wing procedures. Contract commercial carriers provide for
        their own weather support.)
        2.8.1.2. Provide mission weather packages for all AMC IFM missions IAW AFI 11-
        255V3, Integrated Flight Management Responsibilities and Procedures.
        2.8.1.3. Provide mission weather packages to designated AMC and AMC-gained, non-
        IFM missions.
        2.8.1.3. (AMC) Attachment 7 lists AMC and AMC-gained flying organizations
        supported by 618 AOC/XOW.
        2.8.1.4. (Added-AMC) Identify 618 AOC/XOW-supported, non-IFM missions with
        “618” in the “Sortie Allocation2” column of the Global Decision Support System
        (GDSS) Mission Dashboard. (T-2)
        2.8.1.5. (Added-AMC) Identify sortie-specific weather operational risks in the MAF C2
        System (GDSS) for IFM missions using Table 2.5.1 as a guide. (T-2)
    2.8.2. EUs will:
        2.8.2.1. Update take-off weather data and notify 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW if the update
        includes any of the criteria listed in Table 2.5

      2.8.2.2. Provide access to meteorological satellite imagery, radar imagery, and other
      perishable weather data to crews upon request IAW with established duty priorities.
      2.8.2.3. Consult/coordinate with 618 AOC(TACC)/XOW as required to resolve any
      aircrew concerns/issues with the mission weather package. Facilitate discussions
      between aircrew members and 618 AOC(TACC)/XOW to elaborate on weather impacts
      and/or answer aircrew questions. The 618 AOC(TACC)/XOW is the final arbiter for
      weather issues involving AMC sorties/missions.
      2.8.2.4. (Added-AMC) When backing up 618 AOC/XOW, EUs will use GDSS when it
      is available to produce/update mission weather packages. If GDSS is not available, the
      EU will complete and update the mission weather package in accordance with Para
      2.4.1.1. (T-2)
      2.8.2.5. (Added-AMC) Continuously monitor GDSS during WF duty hours for
      situational awareness and to ensure local non-IFM missions requiring 618 AOC/XOW
      weather support are identified and assigned “618” in the “Sortie Allocation2” column on
      the GDSS Mission Dashboard. (T-2)
      2.8.2.6. (Added-AMC) Subscribe to and monitor TACC Weather Threat Assessments
      (WTA) for situational awareness, potential risk mitigation, and to ensure all planning
      products issued by the WF are horizontally consistent with the WTA. Coordinate with
      618 AOC/XOW at DSN 779-3353 if weather deviates from the published WTA threats
      across any of the thresholds specified in Table 2.5.1. (T-2)
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                           35


2.9. Air Combat Command Air Operations Squadron (ACC AOS) Controlled
Missions. The ACC AOS/AOSW Weather Flight (ACC AOS/AOW) is the lead weather
organization for all ACC AOS-controlled missions (which includes all CORONET movements).
EUs supporting launch, alternate, abort and destination bases for ACC AOS-controlled missions
will:
   2.9.1. Brief aircrews using ACC AOS/AOSW CMWPs.
   2.9.2. Coordinate deviations from CMWPs with ACC AOS/AOSW.
   2.9.3. Debrief arriving aircrews at destination bases and report any deviations from the
   CMWP (weather not as forecast) to ACC AOS/AOSW.
2.10. Pilot      Reports     (PIREPs)      and    Significant    Meteorological      Information
(SIGMETs). EUs will actively monitor and apply PIREPs and SIGMETs to MWP processes.
EU leadership will coordinate with local air traffic control towers and radar approach control
facilities to develop local procedures to ensure weather operators receive PIREPs relayed to Air
Traffic Control. Local operating procedures will include timeline requirements (e.g., Air Traffic
Control/Supervisors of Flying will relay pilot report information to weather not later than 5
minutes after receipt) and requirements for relaying all PIREPS to the servicing CU.
2.11. Tactical Decision Aids (TDA). EUs will use only those TDAs developed, certified, and
approved by DoD or AFW coalition sources.
   2.11.1. Target Acquisition Weather Software (TAWS). TAWS predicts the maximum
   detection or lock-on range of air-to-ground electro-optical weapons and sensor systems. For
   the weather input, TAWS may use real-time or model weather data downloaded directly from
   AFWA or a Navy reach-back data server. Weather personnel will use situational awareness
   products provided by the CU to adjust modeled parameters used in the TDA to improve the
   accuracy of the TDA output. In addition to its use by AF weather personnel, pilots in
   mission planning incorporate TAWS into the Pilot Flight Planning System.
   2.11.2. Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aids (IWEDA). IWEDA is a rules-based TDA
   application.    IWEDA supports both Army and Air Force systems, and improves
   interoperability.    IWEDA uses artificial intelligence techniques and knowledge of
   atmospheric effects with model data to enhance and expand current weather decision
   capabilities. It allows commanders to compare weather-based advantages/disadvantages of
   friendly and enemy systems.
   2.11.3. Tactical Decision Aids for Reserve Component Forces. CUs should provide model
   output for meteorological parameters required for tactical decision aids run for Reserve
   Component units without a collocated EU.
2.12. Tropical Cyclone Products.
   2.12.1. EUs will fully utilize and not deviate from the tropical cyclone information provided
   by the servicing CU (i.e., Tropical Cyclone-Threat Analysis Product (TC-TAP)) derived
   from specialized tropical forecast organizations.
       2.12.1.1. EUs will provide tropical cyclone forecasts and updates to supported
       organizations as required for mission execution decisions such as evacuation and force
       protection.
 36                                             AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014


       2.12.1.2. EUs will use the MEFP to tailor the official tropical cyclone forecasts into a
       specific mission forecast product for their supported customers. Tailoring may include
       local effects of vegetation/ground cover, terrain, and position relative to the storm.
       Inland locations may often require the frictional TC-TAP application.
   2.12.2. EUs will provide the necessary forecast services/products required for installation
   commanders to determine or declare a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness and
   Hurricane Condition as outlined in local Operation Plans. EUs will also provide the
   necessary forecast services/products required for installation commanders to make mission
   execution decisions such as evacuation and resource protection.
   2.12.3. EUs will follow installation public affairs policies and procedures regarding the
   release of tropical cyclone forecasts to the general public.
2.13. Space Weather Products. EUs will incorporate space weather products into their MEFP
to provide mission-enhancing information to supported units.
2.14. Volcanic Ash. EUs will utilize appropriate theater-specific volcanic ash products from the
civil Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC) and supplement with 2WS products and services.
All VAAC and 2 WS products are available on the Air Force weather web service.
2.15. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE).
   2.15.1. Air Force Weather forces will serve as Weather SME to CBRN operations IAW roles
   and responsibilities laid out in AFI 15-128 Air Force Weather Roles and Responsibilities,
   AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations,
   and AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and
   High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Environment.
   2.15.2. At the installation level, EU Staff Integration function will:
       2.15.2.1. Routinely meet with installation EM, Fire Emergency Services (FES), and
       Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) to achieve appropriate mission immersion.
       2.15.2.2. Get familiar with the CBRN plume models utilized by these ESFs (e.g., Joint
       Effects Model (JEM), Area Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA), Computer-
       Aided Management of Emergency Operations (CAMEO), etc.), their tactical decision aid
       outputs, and uses in installation commanders’ decision cycles.
       2.15.2.3. Understand the variety of possible weather input options within each model for
       each type of C, B, R, N and E event. See JEM Users Manual, for details, available on the
       AFWKC.
       2.15.2.4. Recommend and provide the most appropriate weather data type for EM and
       other ESFs to use to run their chosen CBRNE model to assess a real-time event which
       has occurred at a specific location and time. The Staff Integration function’s familiarity
       with EM’s and other ESF’s CBRNE models and associated weather input
       parameters/data types will help in determining the optimal weather data type for the
       chosen CBRNE model.
       2.15.2.5. In most cases, transport models can be configured to automatically pull
       observed or forecast gridded model data from DTRA. Provide a region-specific model
       data recommendation consistent with the CU model. For example, if the CU consistently
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                              37


       uses the WRF model then the transport model should be configured to default to the
       WRF. Historical climatological data should not be recommended except for training or
       long-term planning where “canned” scenarios are being used.
       2.15.2.6. If surface observations or alphanumeric forecasts are requested, make sure that
       observations and forecasts provided are representative of the location/time of the CBRN
       event.
       2.15.2.7. Work closely with EM or other ESF functions to ensure the supported
       commander gets a consistent picture.
       2.15.2.8. Upon request from Disaster Preparedness or any other agency, obtain/provide
       CDMs from the servicing CU.
2.16. Shift Change Briefings/Forecast Discussions. A systematic approach will be established
(i.e., shift change and shift duty checklist) to ensure a thorough understanding of the state of the
atmosphere and how it impacts the mission. This will include a review of CU analysis and
forecast products (e.g., hemispheric, synoptic, mesoscale patterns and key parameters, TAFs,
METWATCH products and space weather products), collaboration done with the CU
(Meteorological Conference (METCONs) and discussion bulletins), the forecast challenge(s) for
the shift/day and significant weather impacts on the current and planned missions.
2.16. (AMC) In addition, AMC WFs should review 618 AOC/XOW supported missions (see
Attachement 7) loaded into GDSS, ORM assessments for these flights, and weather threat
assessment notifications.
2.17. Mission-Scale Meteorological Watch (MISSIONWATCH). MISSIONWATCH is a
deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment for specific
mission-limiting environmental factors. The MISSIONWATCH process identifies and alerts
decision makers to changes affecting mission success. EUs will:
   2.17.1. Develop procedures to determine critical thresholds requiring intensified
   MISSIONWATCH and update supported unit(s) on changes to environmental conditions
   critical to the mission.
   2.17.2. Maintain a MISSIONWATCH tailored to the mission(s) of the day.
   2.17.3. Employ sound Operational Risk Management (ORM) techniques, outlined in
   AFMAN 15-129 Volume 1, Air and Space Weather Operations-Characterization, to assign
   risk, allocate resources, and direct activities to conduct MISSIONWATCH for supported
   unit(s) missions.
   2.17.3. (AMC) 618 AOC/XOW will assign risk in GDSS and the WTA tool IAW Table
   2.5.1 for missions identified in para 2.8.1.2 and 2.8.1.3. (T-2)
   2.17.4. Conduct a MISSIONWATCH for critical portions of every mission placed at risk
   due to environmental conditions.
   2.17.5. Inform the servicing CU when weather products issued by the CU do not accurately
   reflect observed conditions and impact flight safety.
   2.17.6. Structure MISSIONWATCH processes to match basic steps outlined in Table 2.6.
   2.17.7. Use the following tools in the MISSIONWATCH process:
 38                                             AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014


      2.17.7.1. Meteorological Satellite (METSAT) imagery (e.g., Infrared, Visible, Water
      Vapor, Microwave).
      2.17.7.2. Real-time surface and upper air data (e.g., alphanumeric products, PIREPs, and
      SIGMETs).
      2.17.7.3. Weather radar/lightning data.
      2.17.7.4. Other data sources (e.g., tower cameras, on-line weather resources, and
      indigenous products).

Table 2.6. Basic MISSIONWATCH Steps
      Determine the mission(s) placed at risk due to terrestrial or space weather
 1.
      conditions.

      Continuously monitor at risk mission routes, areas, installation, etc., for significant
 2.
      changes. Spot-check low risk missions.

 3.   Focus on mission-limiting weather thresholds for each specific mission.

      Evaluate for change in risk category and reprioritize MISSIONWATCH as
 4.   appropriate. Notify operational users of weather conditions crossing mission-
      limiting thresholds.

 5.   Integrate weather impacts into operational alternatives decision process.

 6.   Update MWPs as necessary.

 7.   Continue to monitor missions based on MISSIONWATCH threat.



2.18. Weather Watch, Warning, and Advisory (WWA) Program. Refer to Attachments 3
and 4 for detailed instructions on completing AF IMT 3806 and AF IMT 3807.
   2.18.1. Weather Watches and Warnings. EUs are responsible for coordinating supported
   unit(s) weather watch and warning criteria, as well as tropical cyclone forecasts, to include
   the Desired Lead Times and notification methods with the servicing CU.
      2.18.1.1. EUs will limit weather warning criteria, not already defined in AFMAN 15-129
      Volume 1, Air and Space Weather Operations-Characterization, to weather phenomena
      that threaten life or property, or cause the supported unit to take protective action.
      2.18.1.2. Observed Lightning weather warnings. Lightning warnings are issued when
      lightning is observed or detected within 5 nautical miles of any pre-determined location
      or activity.
      2.18.1.3. EUs will issue and cancel observed lightning warnings during duty hours.
      When issuing or canceling an observed lightning warning, the EU will provide timely
      notification to supported units IAW AFOSH Standards 91-66, General Industrial
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                        39


      Operations & AFOSH Standards 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line – Ground Operations and
      Activities.
      2.18.1.4. EUs issue observed lightning warnings separately from, and at times,
      concurrent with CU-issued warnings for any other criteria. The observed lightning and
      forecast tornado warnings are the only warning that may be issued separately from
      warnings for other criteria.
      2.18.1.5. During non-duty hours, the servicing CU will issue and cancel observed
      lightning warnings.
      2.18.1.6. EUs will issue weather warnings for forecast phenomena when imminent
      weather conditions pose a hazard to life and property, and time of onset does not allow
      collaboration with the servicing CU.
      2.18.1.7. (Added-AMC) Lead times in AFMAN 15-129V1 Table 4.1 are the AMC
      standard. Installation commanders should document requirements and rationale for
      longer/shorter lead times or adding/removing parameters in the minutes of the annual
      Severe Weather Response Meeting. Include all weather warning parameters/lead-times
      in appropriate installation support documents. (T-2)

Table 2.7. (Added-AMC) AMC Standard SWAP Severe Weather Criteria
Tornado Watch
Tornado Warning
Hail > 3/4 inch Warning
Winds > 50 kts Warning
Heavy Snow Warning
Freezing Precipitation Warning


   2.18.2. The EU issuing a weather warning will contact the supporting CU as soon as
   possible after local dissemination to ensure warning information is entered into the CU
   warning tracking and verification system and that expanded METWATCH is assumed by the
   CU. When deployed, EUs will rely on customer-furnished communications to relay weather
   warning information back to the CU.
   2.18.3. Weather Advisories. Weather advisories are special notices provided to an
   operational user to notify them of environmental conditions impacting operations. EUs will:
      2.18.3.1. Coordinate forecast weather advisory requirements with the servicing CU and
      document the requirement on the installation data page.
      2.18.3.2. Coordinate the desired lead time based upon the supported unit(s) requirements
      and the CU’s capability to provide such advance notice. These requirements will be
      documented on the installation data page. Lead time calculation is determined from the
      issue time of the initial weather warning or forecast weather advisory for a forecast
      weather advisory resulting from a weather warning downgrade.
 40                                            AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014


       2.18.3.3. Issue Observed Weather Advisories while on duty. CUs will issue observed
       weather advisories during EU off-duty hours, provided they have the tools and capability
       to do so.
2.19. Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP). EU leadership will develop a SWAP. The
SWAP will define the events, personnel requirements, and operating procedures (e.g., “eyes
forward” and customer interaction) required to help mitigate the threat of severe/mission-limiting
weather.
2.19. (AMC)In addition to SWAP requirements for resource protection, AMC EUs will have
personnel on duty when aircraft assigned to the installation are performing or are scheduled to
perform local flying operations, whether supported by the WF, TACC, or CU, and the following
criteria are occurring or forecast to occur within 2 hours. This does not change the requirements
for EU availability as specified in para 2.5.2. (T-3)
 Cig/Vis < 200/0.5 or Airfield Minimums
 Volcanic Ash
 Low Level Wind Shear
 Thunderstorms
 Ice Pellets
 Turbulence ≥ Severe
 Severe Icing
 Crosswinds sustained ≥ 20kts
 High Risk/High Visibility Missions


   2.19.1. In concert with and support of installation commander requirements, EUs will
   conduct and document annual exercises of the SWAP and ensure validity of plans to respond
   to severe weather. Real world events meet this requirement if properly evaluated and
   documented, to include lessons learned.
   2.19.2. SWAP Procedures. The EU will ensure sufficient manpower when implementing
   SWAP to meet the increased demand for timely weather information from its supported
   unit(s) during significant weather events.
   2.19.3. The EU will request assistance through their MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/OWS on SWAP
   execution problems not resolvable at the local level, or for severe weather forecasting
   seminars, as required.
2.20. Severe Weather Reporting (e. g., OPREP-3). EUs will develop procedures to provide
appropriate information to the installation agency (i.e., command post, operations center, etc.)
IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting and installation policies. EUs will ensure the CU and
parent MAJCOM functional are aware of the reported weather event as soon as practical.
2.21. MWP Reviews. EU leadership will determine the MWPs to be reviewed, monitor the
performance of the products, and assign the reviews as required. MWP reviews focus on a
particular weather event at a single location or region and examine the effectiveness of forecast
reasoning, tools, and methods employed. Leadership will also coordinate parameters for MWP
reviews and review requests from CUs. EUs will develop performance feedback mechanisms to
incorporate seasonal training or specific forecast parameter improvement.
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                         41


2.21. (AMC) 618 AOC/XOW will verify 10% of locally derived MWP elements. Other units
will verify all locally derived MWP elements. (T-2) AMC weather units are not required to
perform verification or reviews on MWP elements utilizing only CU characterization.
   2.21.1. EUs will develop a consistent approach to conduct and document MWP reviews.
   The servicing OWS will include pertinent commentary/input from EUs in MWP reviews.
   2.21.2. MWP reviews should be short (typically three pages or less), simple to complete, and
   focused on a specific part of the MEFP. The MWP review will briefly outline the tools and
   reasoning used to make the forecast product and describe potential improvements to the EU
   forecast processes.
   2.21.2. (AMC) Refer to Air Force Weather Agency’s Weather Techniques and Procedures
   Document 3.1.5., Forecast Reviews for additional guidance on CU and EU forecast review
   recommendations, and procedures.

                            AIRFIELD SUPPORT FUNCTION

3.1. Airfield Support Function. The Airfield Support Function consists of weather observing,
meteorological watch, and resource protection.
   3.1.1. EUs responsible for the official airfield observation will prepare routine and special
   weather observations and make them available to CUs and users in the AOR requiring this
   information. Observations will be recorded and disseminated in accordance with AFMAN
   15-111, Surface Weather Observations, and MAJCOM supplements, as applicable.
   3.1.2. “Eyes Forward.”       EUs will relay significant, time-sensitive meteorological
   information not found in coded meteorological reports to relative CUs to assist in
   characterization operations.
       3.1.2.1. EUs will retain an “eyes forward” role with the CU providing resource
       protection products under circumstances where the US National Weather Service or a
       host nation issues the aerodrome forecast and/or observation.
       3.1.2.2. Expeditionary/deployed EUs will relay pertinent observations from tactical or
       fixed radars, upper air soundings, and any other meteorological information to the
       servicing CU or another agency as tasked in the OPLAN, EXORD, JMO LOI, etc for the
       ongoing operation. Units will also ensure mission impacting weather information is
       provided to their customers if operations occur away from main operating locations.
3.2. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Review.
   3.2.1. EUs will have procedures to review each new edition of applicable DoD FLIPs as
   soon as possible after publication, including the Radar Instrument Approach Minimums,
   local Notice To Airmen (NOTAMs), and applicable directives for changes in:
       3.2.1.1. Airfield minima affecting SPECI/LOCAL observation criteria (reference Radar
       Instrument Approach Minimums).
       3.2.1.2. Pilot-to-Metro-Service   (PMSV)       contact   information   (reference    IFR
       Supplement).
       3.2.1.3. Supporting OWS contact information.
       3.2.1.4. Airfield services hours, if different from airfield hours (reference IFR
       Supplement).
   3.2.2. Coordinate updates or changes to DoD FLIPs through the local airfield management
   office or responsible agency using the standardized procedures and formats found in the
   General Planning FLIP.
3.3. Pilot-To-Metro-Service (PMSV). PMSV systems vary in type across both Air Force and
Army locations. These systems are not required for weather personnel to accomplish their
mission; however, if installed, these systems provide a valuable service to aircrews.
Organizations that provide PMSV will develop procedures for operations. All contacts with
airborne aircrews, including phone patches, High Frequency (HF)/Ultra High Frequency (UHF)
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                                                                                 43


radio contacts, aircrew generated computer messages, satellite communications equipment, and
cell phones will be considered PMSV contacts. EUs will:
       3.3.1. Use proper radio discipline and standard phraseology found in FAA Order 7110.10,
       Flight Service, when using the PMSV.
       3.3.2. Respond to all PMSV contacts IAW Unit Duty Priorities (as applicable). Weather
       organizations monitoring common PMSV radio frequencies will respond if another weather
       organization does not answer an aircrew request after two contact attempts.
       3.3.3. Pass only current, complete, and relevant information to aircrews. Warn aircrews of
       all weather hazards along their flight route. Relay the position and movement of any weather
       hazards to the aircrew.
       3.3.4. Do not vector aircraft around hazards, such as thunderstorms.
       3.3.5. Solicit a PIREP at the conclusion of every airborne contact.
       3.3.5. (AMC) Automated responses will include text to solicit a PIREP. (T-2)
       3.3.6. Log all PMSV contacts (including phone calls). Figure 3.1 illustrates an example of a
       locally developed PMSV log. WFs will log the following information, at a minimum, for
       each contact:
       3.3.6. (AMC) Applies to all AMC EUs.
           3.3.6.1. Aircraft call sign or number.
           3.3.6.2. Brief summation of the information passed to the aircrew.
           3.3.6.3. Date Time Group (DTG) of the contact.

      3.3.7.1. Record any discrepancies, such as weak transmission strength, weak reception,
      distortion, static, etc., on the PMSV log to assist maintenance personnel in correcting the
      problem.
      3.3.7.2. Log out PMSV contact equipment (i.e., radio, telephone) IAW locally developed
      procedures or as specified by MAJCOM/higher headquarters directives.
   3.3.8. UHF/Very High Frequency (VHF) Radio Outages. EUs with radio equipment will
   arrange for another agency (i.e., ATC tower, radar) or another weather organization to
   provide backup during radio outages, as capability exists, and will notify the backup unit
   when the equipment is back in operation. Request base/airfield operations personnel include
   PMSV outages in Airfield Advisories and Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs).
3.4. PIREPS. All PIREPs, regardless of delivery format, will be documented, maintained, and
retained IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule and AFI 33-364, Records Disposition -
Procedures and Responsibilities. EUs will:
   3.4.1. Develop and implement procedures to encourage aircrews to provide timely PIREPs
   to collect meteorological elements of operational significance to flying or surface activities,
   and assist local flying operations (e.g., turbulence, icing, cloud bases and/or tops when
   departing/arriving, in-flight visibility at low levels, upper winds, valley fog, etc).
   3.4.2. Develop specific procedures to ensure weather technicians properly encode and
   disseminate PIREPs in accordance with AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes.
      3.4.2.1. Immediately disseminate all urgent PIREPs locally and longline.
      3.4.2.2. Disseminate all routine PIREPs locally and longline unless two or more PIREPS
      have substantially the same information. In this case disseminate only the most recent.
      Include a remark indicating the number of reports of the same phenomena and the time
      interval in which they were received (e.g., "3 RPTS last five minutes," "NUMEROUS
      ACFT").
3.5. Aircraft/Ground Mishap Data Save. EUs will:
   3.5.1. Save all applicable and available terrestrial and space weather data when notified of
   any aircraft or ground mishaps (weather-related or not) requiring OPREP-3 reporting or local
   reporting requirements IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. Coordinate with other
   units (i.e., OWS, TACC) to ensure required data is saved.
   3.5.2. Ensure all data used in the development of any weather information, product, or
   service provided to a customer are saved, including but not limited to:
      3.5.2.1. METSAT imagery (i.e., Visible, Infrared, Water Vapor).
      3.5.2.2. Radar products if available (i.e., Base Reflectivity, Velocity-Azimuth Display
      Winds, Echo Tops, Composite Reflectivity, Base Velocity).
      3.5.2.3. Upper air package.
      3.5.2.4. Hazard charts (i.e., thunderstorm, lower and upper level turbulence, icing).
      3.5.2.5. PIREPs, SIGMETs.
      3.5.2.6. TAFs and observations for departure point, destination, and any alternate(s).
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                            45


       3.5.2.7. Weather warnings, watches, and advisories.
       3.5.2.8. Upper air soundings enroute and nearest the mishap site.
       3.5.2.9. Briefing material provided to the mishap aircrew (i.e., DD Form 175-1,
       mesoscale tailored graphics).
   3.5.3. EUs will notify the OWS Operations Floor Production Supervisor of all aircraft
   mishaps as soon as possible after notification of the event. Note: Expedient notification is
   critical to archiving data pertinent to the mishap.
   3.5.4. Gather the saved data and hold it until requested or send the data to the organization
   requesting the data save.
   3.5.5. Do not dispose of the data until the organization initiating the data save determines it
   is no longer needed and coordinates the disposition with all organizations involved.
   3.5.6. EUs will coordinate with AFWA Operations to save any applicable data and products
   that cannot be saved locally. EUs contacting AFWA will provide a specific list of data to be
   saved.
3.6. Collocated weather organizations. Airfields with multiple weather organizations assigned
will have one as the responsible weather organization for airfield services. The responsible
weather organization is determined by the supported organization that has Senior Airfield
Authority (SAA) for that base as directed by the Joint Force Commander. For example, if a
tanker unit is the SAA for a particular base with fighters and Army aircraft, then that tanker
unit/OSS weather organization will be the responsible weather organization supporting airfield
services.
3.7. Airfield Operations Board (AOB). EUs will participate as a member of the AOB as
directed in AFI 13-204 Vol III, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs.

                                          Chapter 4

                         SPECIALIZED SUPPORT OPERATIONS

4.1. Weather Support for Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC). Weather organizations
supporting AOC operations will utilize the MEFP to develop MWPs and provide support IAW
AFI 13-1AOC, Volume 3, Operational Procedures-Air and Space Operations Center. Weather
organizations will use all available information (e.g., alphanumeric data, satellite) to collect
weather data for injection into key elements of the Air Tasking Order (ATO) cycle, and to
integrate environmental effects to enhance combat capability. Proactive application of weather
impacts will help shape AOC operations during mission planning and execution.
4.2. Unmanned Aircraft Support. Unmanned aircraft are categorized into five groups
according to their maximum gross takeoff weight, normal operating altitude, and speed (see
Attachment 1). Small unmanned aircraft (Groups 1 and 2) are typically not on the ATO and
receive general weather support (i.e., area forecasts) not tailored to specific missions. Large
unmanned aircraft (Groups 3-5) receive direct weather support as described below.
   4.2.1. Air Force Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Support. The Air Force refers to Group 4
   and larger unmanned aircraft as RPA. Group 4 and 5 RPA (i.e., MQ-1/9 and RQ-4) are
   considered no different than manned aircraft by the Air Force and will be operated IAW AFI
   11-202V3, General Flight Rules. Therefore, weather organizations supporting Group 4 and
   5 RPA will provide integrated weather support to pilots and sensor operators IAW the
   MEFP. Group 4 and 5 RPA are employed using a distributed form of command and control
   known as remote split operations (RSO). Utilizing RSO, a pilot at a launch and recovery
   element (LRE) takes off and lands the aircraft while a pilot at a mission control element
   (MCE) flies the tasked mission. The tactical operations of multiple LREs and MCEs are
   coordinated at the operational level by the 432d Wing Operations Center (MQ-1/9) and
   Global Hawk Operations Center (RQ-4).
       4.2.1.1. Due to the distributed nature of RSO, multiple weather organizations may
       support a single RPA mission: the EU collocated with the LRE, the EU collocated with
       the MCE, the EU collocated with the operational-level C2 center (C2 EU), the AOC
       WST, the regional OWS, and (often) a EU collocated with a supported ground
       commander. Some organizations may perform more than one role (i.e., the C2 EU may
       also support tactical-level MCEs). Since Go/No-Go weather decisions are made at the
       operational level, the C2 EU is the LWU if multiple weather organizations are involved
       in RSO support.
           4.2.1.1.1. The C2 EU is responsible for the controlling MWP (if required) and
           Go/No-Go weather recommendations to the operational-level C2 center (i.e., 432d
           Wing Operations Center or Global Hawk Operations Center).
           4.2.1.1.2. The EU directly supporting the MCE is responsible for the MWPs
           (excluding take-off and landing weather if provided by a LRE EU), MWP updates to
           support dynamic re-tasking, and MISSIONWATCH. MISSIONWATCH will include
           the LRE location, divert location(s), mission operating area(s), mission and
           contingency flight routes, and satellite uplink/downlink nodes in the RSO
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                            47


           communications architecture. If no MCE EU is assigned, the C2 EU will provide this
           support.
           4.2.1.1.3. EUs supporting RPA LREs will provide airfield support, take-off and
           landing forecasts, observed advisories, and “eyes forward” support for other weather
           organizations supporting RSO. The LRE EU will coordinate with the C2 EU and
           MCE EU if take-off and landing weather is forecast to exceed RPA mission-limiting
           weather thresholds (see AFI 11-2 Volume 3 instructions for the MQ-1, MQ-9, and
           RQ-4). CU TAF and WWA support for LRE locations will incorporate all RPA
           mission-limiting thresholds. A summary of LRE EU, MCE EU, C2 EU and CU
           responsibilities for Group 4 and 5 RPA weather support is provided in Table 4.1.

Notes:
1. If an EU is not assigned to the LRE location, an OWS may be required to provide LRE
support (e.g., RQ-4s operating from Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy will be supported from the
21 OWS because no EU is assigned).

2. Some MCEs are directly supported by an EU (e.g., Air National Guard EUs, the 319
OSS/OSW at Grand Forks AFB). MCEs not directly supported by an EU receive this support
from the C2 EU (e.g., 432 OSS/OSW, 9 OSS/OSW).

       4.2.1.2. EUs and CUs will use all available means (e.g., SIPRNET, mIRC Internet Relay
       Chat) to coordinate RPA weather support. As part of their LWU responsibility, the C2
       EU will adjudicate disagreements among other weather organizations, if necessary. The
       C2 EU will inform all weather organizations involved in RSO mission support, and if
       possible weather organizations attached to supported ground commanders, when
48                                           AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014


     observed or forecast weather conditions may impact (or have impacted) the planned
     mission.
     4.2.1.3. C2 EUs and/or MCE EUs will inform their supporting CU(s) when regional-
     scale weather products do not meet the unique temporal and spatial requirements for RPA
     support (i.e., EUs will inform the CU when they are forced to characterize to produce
     RPA MWPs). To ensure CU products keep pace with changing support requirements,
     RPA EUs will utilize the SAR process to request higher temporal/spatial fidelity weather
     products as new requirements emerge.
  4.2.2. Army Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Support.
     4.2.2.1. EUs supporting Army UAS will:
        4.2.2.1.1. Provide general weather support for Group 1 and 2 UAS (e.g., RQ-11B
        Raven and gasoline engine Micro-Air Vehicle (gMAV)). General weather support
        consists of “area forecasts” not tailored to specific missions.
        4.2.2.1.2. Provide direct weather support for Group 3-5 UAS pilots and payload
        operators IAW the MEFP (e.g., RQ-7B Shadow, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-5B
        Hunter). Minimum weather conditions for UAS operations and mission-limiting
        weather thresholds are contained in Army Regulation 95-23, Unmanned Aircraft
        System Flight Regulations, and UAS-specific technical manuals (e.g., TM 1-1550-
        696-10, MQ-1C Operating Procedures; TM 1-1550-692-10, MQ-5B Operating
        Procedures).
     4.2.2.2. Army UAS’ are typically employed in a decentralized manner and optimized for
     full integration into organic unit operations at the division-level and below. Therefore, to
     enable decentralized operations, EUs at each echelon operating Group 3-5 UAS’ will
     provide or arrange for direct weather support for their UAS assets (e.g., EUs at Combat
     Aviation Brigades (CABs) will support their CAB’s UAS, EUs at Brigade Combat
     Teams (BCTs) will support their BCT’s UAS, etc.). Group 3-5 UAS operating without a
     collocated EU will be supported by the CAB EU or servicing OWS.
        4.2.2.2.1. Army UAS are typically launched and recovered near the Ground Control
        Station (GCS).       Therefore, the EU supporting the GCS will also support
        launch/recovery (L/R) operations. Weather support for geographically separated L/R
        sites will be arranged by the EU supporting the GCS.
        4.2.2.2.2. Weather support to the GCS crew will consist of MWPs, updates to
        support dynamic re-tasking and MISSIONWATCH. MISSIONWATCH will include
        the L/R site, divert location(s), mission operating area(s), and mission/contingency
        flight routes.
        4.2.2.2.3. EUs, CUs and AOC WSTs (for Army UAS operating above the
        coordinating altitude) will use all means available to coordinate UAS weather support
        (e.g., SIPRNET, Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), mIRC
        chat, instant messaging, phone).
        4.2.2.2.4. EUs supporting UAS will inform their supporting CU(s) when regional-
        scale weather products do not meet the unique temporal and spatial requirements for
        UAS support (i.e., EUs will inform the CU when they are forced to characterize to
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                           49


           produce UAS MWPs). To ensure OWS products keep pace with changing support
           requirements, EUs will utilize the SAR process to request higher temporal/spatial
           fidelity weather products as new UAS support requirements emerge.
   4.2.3. Lighter than Air Vehicle Support. Lighter than air vehicles are categorized by the
   highest level of any of their operating criteria (e.g., Tethered Aerostat Radar System
   operating above 3,500’ AGL is a Group 3 unmanned aircraft regardless of its other operating
   criteria). Similar to other unmanned aircraft support, Group 1 and 2 lighter than air vehicles
   will receive general weather support and Group 3-5 will receive direct weather support.
4.3. Weather Support to 618 AOC/Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC). 618 AOC
(TACC)/XOW will utilize the MEFP to develop MWPs. 618 AOC(TACC)/XOW will use all
available information (e.g., OWS products, alphanumeric data, satellite) for injection into key
elements of mission planning and/or execution, and to integrate environmental effects to enhance
combat capability. 618 AOC(TACC)/XOW will:
   4.3.1. Provide 24-hour global surveillance to determine strategic, operational, and tactical
   weather threats to AMC assets.
   4.3.2. Provide a continuous RED/GREEN risk management (RM) assessment of each 618
   AOC (TACC)-controlled mission.
   4.3.2. (AMC) Begin assigning Red/Green Operational Risk Management (ORM) for all
   missions starting NLT 36-hours prior to the Estimated Time of Departure or immediately for
   sorties dropped-in within the 36-hour window. ORM will continue during mission execution
   through mission completion (arrival). A sortie is assigned a red ORM when the thresholds in
   Table 2.5.1 are met. (T-2)
   4.3.3. Respond to airborne contacts for IFM and Mission Weather Services sorties/missions.
   4.3.4. Resolve differences between 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW forecasts and CU products.
   4.3.5. (Added-AMC) Maintain the Weather Threat Assessment (WTA) tool for all IFM and
   618 AOC/XOW allocated non-IFM missions determined to be at risk based on
   forecasted/observed weather criteria specified in Table 2.5.1. Ensure organizations/personnel
   requiring notification subscribe via https://tacc.scott.af.mil/?action=WTAMain to receive
   notification of impacted missions. (T-2) Note: The WTA will not replace the WWA process
   or weather display systems (e.g. JET) for any installation.
4.4. Weather Support to Air Combat Command Air Operations Squadron (ACC AOS)
Missions. The ACC AOS Weather Flight (ACC AOS/AOSW) will:
   4.4.1. Use the MEFP to tailor and integrate decision-grade weather information into
   supported ACC AOS-controlled and non-AOS controlled missions.
   4.4.2. Prepare a CMWP to include a horizontal weather depiction and forecast discussion for
   each supported ACC AOS-controlled mission.
   4.4.3. Coordinate with supporting CUs as needed to resolve issues with characterization
   product meshing when supported missions cross AOR boundaries.
   4.4.4. Post CMWPs on the appropriate ACC AOS web page (classified or unclassified) and/or
   disseminate directly to end users not later than (NLT) 6 hours prior to mission launch (L-6).
 50                                            AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014


   4.4.5. Provide MISSIONWATCH services to the ACC AOS Mission Control Center (AOS
   MCC) for AOS-controlled aircraft movements.
   4.4.6. Advise the ACC AOS MCC as soon as possible when weather parameters at
   designated airfields along the mission route cross mission-limiting thresholds.
   4.4.7. Issue amendments to CMWPs IAW ACC AOS amendment criteria.
   4.4.8. Post CMWP amendments to the ACC AOS web page, notify the ACC AOS MCC by
   telephone or in person, and inform the senior ACC staff member of significant weather
   impacts to ACC bases or operations.
4.5. Space Weather Support Cooperation
   4.5.1. 21st Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (21 OSS/OSW). The 21 OSS/OSW
   North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Support section provides 24/7
   space and terrestrial weather support to NORAD Operations, 21st Space Wing, US Northern
   Command (USNORTHCOM), and US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).
   4.5.2. 614 Air and Space Operations Center Weather Specialty Team (614 AOC/CODW).
   614 AOC/CODW provides terrestrial and space weather support to the 614th AOC also
   known as the Joint Space Operations Center (JSPOC). The weather team also supports
   Headquarters 14th Air Force (14 AF), with tailored space weather support including
   anomaly/impact assessments and space alert/warning notification. Other customers include
   14 AF weather units and US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).
   4.5.3. 21 OSS/OSW and 614 AOC/CODW will work closely with 2d Weather Squadron (2
   WS) as the CU for space weather.
   4.5.4. Assessment Procedures. 21 OSS/OSW and 614 AOC/CODW provide near real time
   space weather assessments to their respective supported units. These units will:
      4.5.4.1. Notify 2 WS and flight leadership (if available) and form a consensus on the
      assessment.
      4.5.4.2. Provide the assessment to the requesting supported unit.
      4.5.4.3. If the assessment was time critical not allowing for contact of 2 WS or flight
      leadership, units will provide their organic assessment as required. The unit will then
      validate the provided assessment with flight leadership and 2 WS as soon as possible
      after-the-fact.
      4.5.4.4. If the after-the-fact assessment evaluation differs significantly from the initial
      assessment, the applicable unit should provide this change to the supported unit as
      quickly as possible with specific rationale explaining the reasons for the difference.
      4.5.4.5. In all cases when a space weather assessment is provided or a space weather impact
      is reported, the applicable weather unit will ensure the information is accurately documented
      and cross-fed to MAJCOM weather functional managers, HQ AFWA, 2 WG and 2 WS.
4.6. Weather Support for Space Launch and Range Operations. 45th Weather Squadron (45
WS) and 30th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (30 OSS/OSW) will utilize the
MEFP to develop MWPs to support their respective wing missions and launch ranges as
directed.

will include troubleshooting procedures, reporting and tracking equipment/communication
outages, and applicable back-up equipment/systems if available.
5.2. Meteorological Equipment. AF Weather organizations will comply with the following
requirements applicable to all assigned user/operator-maintained meteorological equipment used
in the production of weather data.
   5.2.1. Perform required user/operator maintenance IAW equipment Technical Orders (TOs)
   and operator manuals.
   5.2.2. Maintain applicable operator manuals and/or TOs (soft or hard copy) on hand for each
   piece of assigned fixed and deployable meteorological equipment.
   5.2.3. Operate meteorological equipment IAW applicable TOs and/or operator manuals
   5.2.4. Appoint a system manager for meteorological systems (i.e., FMH-5 Joint
   Environmental Toolkit (JET), FMQ-19, etc.). System managers will maintain a continuity
   file with the following information:
       5.2.4.1. Appointment letters for the primary and alternate system manager.
       5.2.4.2. System siting/location information of sensors, servers, and workstations.
       5.2.4.3. A listing of user account holders, with POCs for each workcenter.
       5.2.4.4. Outage, MAJCOM POC, and AFWA POC.
       5.2.4.5. Copies of the approval to operate and AF authority to connect, or Army
       certificate of networthiness, as appropriate.           Note:     These documents are
       stored/maintained by Air Force Space Command/A6 (AFSPC/A6). AFWA/A6 will be
       able to assist weather organizations that need copies of these documents.
       5.2.4.6. System specific configuration information needed to manage the weather system
       (i.e., products received and/or produced).
       5.2.4.7. Copies of any support agreements that affect the operation or maintenance of the
       system.
5.3. Technical Assistance. Weather organizations that require technical assistance for AFW
fielded systems will notify the AFWA Fielded Systems Service Center (FSSC). The AFWA
FSSC is the single point of contact for weather organizations requiring technical assistance and
provides a 24-hour a day, 7-days a week service to handle trouble calls. The FSSC will maintain
detailed information on all outages and will track these outages until successful resolution.
Note: AF weather organizations will not contact the contractors directly unless otherwise
directed.
 52                                           AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014


   5.3.1. The FSSC will record outage data to identify trends, extended outages, etc., and
   submit to AF/ Director of Weather (AF/A3O-W) in the AFWA daily update. The FSSC will
   also prioritize the management of existing outages and provide customers with timely
   updates when estimated restoration times change and when jobs are closed. Finally,
   customers will be contacted on a recurring basis in order to ascertain that each customer’s
   concerns have been fully resolved.
   5.3.1. (AMC) Outage status can be monitored through the AFWA fielded system support
   center website at https://afwa-arsweb.afwa.af.mil/
   5.3.2. Weather organizations should conduct basic troubleshooting first to determine the
   nature of the equipment outage using system manuals, local troubleshooting guides, or
   instructions available from 2nd Combat Weather Systems Squadron before contacting the
   FSSC. With assistance from the FSSC, weather personnel will generally be able to resolve
   most problems. If the problem cannot be resolved, the FSSC will contact the appropriate
   maintenance agency. In some cases, the FSSC may direct the weather organization to
   contact their local communication agency.
   5.3.2. (AMC) AMC EUs will coordinate with local communications squadron to establish,
   in the local weather support document, the restoral priorities for airfield weather sensors
   IAW AFI 21-103 attachment 15. (T-2)
   5.3.3. Weather organizations will accomplish the following IAW AFI 33-118,
   Electromagnetic Spectrum Management or FM 6-20.70 Army Electromagnetic Spectrum
   Operations:
      5.3.3.1. Submit radio frequency assignment requests to the Installation Spectrum
      Manager (ISM) for equipment (e.g., PMSV, AMOS, radar). Contact the MAJCOM
      Functional Manager for assistance in obtaining system specific radio frequency
      assignment request inputs.
      5.3.3.2. Report any frequency interference to the ISM.
   5.3.4. (Added-AMC) AMC weather units will notify HQ AMC/A3AW of any weather
   systems and equipment outage lasting 72 hours or more, or when weather systems/equipment
   does not allow the unit to meet its operational mission requirements. (T-2)
5.4. Weather Radar (i. e., WSR-88D, PDR, EWR). Weather organizations will:
   5.4.1. Coordinate significant changes affecting the control and operation (i.e., range,
   elevation, display parameters, and screen capture intervals for the imagery products provided
   on the Local Area Network [LAN] and the CU), and maintenance of the weather radar with
   the servicing CU. Note: This applies to organizations with Master System Control functions
   and/or tactical radars.
   5.4.2. Develop procedures for the proper configuration and operation of radar equipment
   IAW Technical Orders (TOs), equipment manuals, and applicable handbooks.
   5.4.3. Weather technicians employing a Doppler radar in MISSIONWATCH/METWATCH
   activities will:

      such as current Volume Coverage Pattern (VCP), Routine Product Set (RPS) list, and
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                             53


      environmental factors (e.g., environmental winds vs. VWP, tropopause height, height of -
      20 C isotherm) prior to data interpretation.
      5.4.3.2. Make optimum use of the RPS lists for the current VCP and alert paired product
      listings for storm interrogation and choose the best product to use for a particular forecast
      pattern.
   5.4.4. Ensure the following information is available to the operator: list of points of contact
   (e.g., maintenance for units with Unit Control Position responsibility), system
   troubleshooting guide, and a breakdown of the products on the RPS for the various VCPs.
   5.4.5. Develop local procedures for reporting equipment outages and troubleshooting
   problems to include startup, restart, and shutdown, as appropriate.
   5.4.6. Correctly identify and interpret relevant weather radar signatures and products
   common to the weather organization’s area of operations.
5.5. Pre-Deployment and Periodic Operations Checks/Inventories.
   5.5.1. Semiannually, weather organizations with deployable tactical meteorological
   equipment will:
      5.5.1.1. Set up, do an operations check, and troubleshoot all assigned deployable tactical
      meteorological equipment. Organizations will incorporate operations checks and
      troubleshooting into their recurring training.
      5.5.1.2. Inventory the system. Retain a copy and notify the MAJCOM Weather
      Functional and AFWA FSSC of outages or shortfalls. Note: A detailed TMQ-53
      inventory and packing list is included in the TMQ-53 T.O.
   5.5.2. When weather units are tasked to deploy equipment they will:
   5.5.2. (AMC) Exception: AMC EUs are not required to perform an operations check on the
   Iridium transmission capability.

Preparation of the Operational Environment (IPOE), Operational Risk Management (ORM)
process, and Common Operating Picture (COP).
Group 1 UAS—- Unmanned aircraft typically less than 20 pounds in weight that normally
operate below 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) at speeds less than 250 knots (e.g., RQ-11B
Raven, gMAV).
Group 2 UAS—- Unmanned aircraft in the 21-55 pound weight class that normally operate
below 3500 feet AGL at speeds less than 250 knots (e.g., Scan Eagle).
Group 3 UAS—- Unmanned aircraft that weigh more than 55 pounds, but less than 1320
pounds, and normally operate below 18,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) at speeds less than 250
knots (e.g., RQ-7B Shadow).
Group 4 UAS—- Unmanned aircraft that weigh more than 1320 pounds and normally operate
below 18,000 feet MSL at any speed (e.g., MQ-1B Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, MQ-5B Hunter).
Group 5 UAS—- Unmanned aircraft that weigh more than 1320 pounds and normally operate
higher than 18,000 feet MSL at any speed (e.g., MQ-9A Reaper, RQ-4 Global Hawk).
Launch and Recovery Element—-- Deployed personnel based at a forward location who are
responsible for the launch, recovery and ground support of a RPA.
METWATCH—--A deliberate process for monitoring the terrestrial weather or space environment
in an area or region. The purpose of a METWATCH is to identify when and where observed
conditions significantly diverge from forecast conditions and determine courses of action to update or
amend a forecast product or group of products and notify designated agencies.
Military Operating Area Forecast—--A forecast guidance product that provides the weather or
space environmental conditions for a specific area in which military operations are occurring.
Mission Control Element—- A GCS (usually established in a geographically separated
location) responsible for taking a RPA from an LRE following takeoff, executing the mission
and then handing the RPA back to the LRE for recovery and landing.
Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP)— A systematic, repeatable process for tailoring
weather products and forecasting mission-limiting meteorological parameters and providing
decision quality environmental information for an operational end user. This process provides a
basic framework for fusing perishable meteorological data, operational and strategic forecast
products, and an understanding of the supported user’s tactics which will be applied to any
mission their supported user may undertake. The MEFP describes an end-to-end process
incorporating management steps, forecast development, mission meteorological watch, and post-
mission analysis of the information provided.
AFMAN15-129V2_AMCSUP_I 27 JUNE 2014                                                              63


Mission Integration—The ability to understand mission platforms, equipment, and systems
capabilities/sensitivities as well as mission processes (e.g., JOPP, MDMP, IPOE, ORM, COP,
tactics, etc.) and inject the right information at the right time every time, enabling mitigation of
environmental threats as early as possible in the mission planning process, ultimately optimizing
mission execution.
Mission Profile—--describes a mission’s operating platform(s), route, flight level(s), weapons
systems, equipment, target(s), tactics/techniques/procedures (TTPs), and timing.
MISSIONWATCH—--A deliberate process of monitoring terrestrial weather or the space
environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors that may adversely impact
missions in execution. The MISSIONWATCH process is performed by WFs and WSTs and is
intended to identify previously unidentified environmental threats and alert decision-makers at
the operational unit and/or airborne mission commanders, enabling dynamic changes to mission
profiles that may mitigate the environmental threat and optimize the chance of mission success.
Mission Weather Product (MWP)—--Any weather product or group of weather products
generated by an EU that is integrated into the military decision making process. MWPs may be
planning or execution products and are not limited to aviation missions.
(Added) (AMC) (AMC) Mission Weather Services (MWS)— a set of mission-specific
weather products delivered to commanders, mission planners, and aircrew designed to enhance
the safety, effectiveness, and efficiency of Air Force operations.
Special Weather Statement (SWS)—--An OWS notice to supported customers of
meteorological effects which could impact future operations. This notice is for situational
awareness purposes only and does not require action by supported customers.

Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) ---A coded weather bulletin providing forecast
information for an aerodrome complex to facilitate flight planning and command and control.
TAFs are formatted IAW AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes, and amended IAW AFMAN
15-129, Air and Space Weather Operations-Characterization.
Weather Advisory—--A special weather product to alert an end user of the occurrence of, or
imminent occurrence of weather conditions impacting operations.
Weather Flight (WF)—--Weather flights, detachments, and operating locations whose primary
purpose is to facilitate exploitation of the environment through integration at every step of the
operations planning and execution process. The WF may be located with the supported unit on an
Air Force base, Army post, remotely located in another weather unit, or at a deployed location.
Weather Warning—--A special weather product to facilitate resource protection decisions.
Weather Warnings alert designated agencies to the imminent or actual occurrence of weather
conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property for which the agency must take
immediate protective actions.
Weather Watch—--A special weather product to facilitate resource protection decisions.
Weather Watches provide advance notice to designated agencies of the existence of a potential
for weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property for which the
agency should consider taking protective measures.

   A2.3.10. Block 23. TURBULENCE (not associated with thunderstorms). Enter the name
   and DTG of the turbulence forecast product used (e.g., AFWA/OWS products, NWS or
   foreign In-Flight Weather Advisories). Enter the type, intensity, levels, and locations of
   turbulence affecting the route or specific mission.
   A2.3.11. Block 24. ICING (not associated with thunderstorms). Enter the name and DTG
   of the icing forecast product used (e.g., AFWA/OWS products, NWS or foreign In-Flight
   Weather Advisories). Enter the type, intensity, levels, and locations of icing affecting the
   route or specific mission.
Note: Like AFWA and OWS forecast products, In-Flight Weather Advisories are advisory in
nature and should be used as guidance when preparing the enroute forecast. They must be
carefully evaluated and tempered with all available data (e.g., radar, PIREPs/AIREPs, upper air
soundings, online resources) to determine the potential effects on the specific mission and
aircraft. Even if not used as the basis for the forecast, weather personnel must alert aircrews to
all existing In-Flight Weather Advisories that affect their mission. If the weather briefer
disagrees with the advisory, annotate the fact in the "Remarks" section of the DD Form 175-1 or
equivalent. Whether or not the condition described is potentially hazardous to a particular flight
is for the pilot to evaluate based on experience, the mission, and the operational limits of the
aircraft. See FAA Aeronautical Information Manual for detailed information on NWS In-Flight
Weather Advisories.
   A2.3.12. Block 25. PRECIPITATION. Enter the type, intensity, character, and
   geographical location of precipitation areas affecting the route or specific mission. This
   block is for precipitation encountered at flight level, not at the surface.

A2.4. PART III - AERODROME FORECASTS. Brief the worst conditions expected to
prevail during the valid period for both destination and alternate. Ensure the aircrew is briefed
on, and fully understand, the entire weather situation at the destination and alternates. The need
for and the selection of an alternate is a pilot decision. However, weather technicians need to be
familiar with the basic USAF, Army, and Navy/Marine provisions for alternate selection. Refer
to AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, Army Regulation 95-1, Flight Regulations, or
OPNAVINST 3710.7, NATOPS General Flight and Operating Instructions for specific alternate
requirements. Enter forecasts for subsequent stops and alternates on request, but advise the pilot
that updates are necessary. Brief destination forecasts in terms the aircrew understands and
prefers.
   A2.4.1. Block 26. DEST/ALTN. Enter the appropriate station identifier (ICAO) for the
   destination (DEST) or alternate (ALTN) aerodrome forecast. Designate DEST or ALTN
   used. Place conditions described by a TEMPO group on the next line, line through
   DEST/ALTN, and enter TEMPO in the block. Note: PGS/S-developed briefings place
   TEMPO groups on the same line. Place local hazard forecasts from the TAF in the Remarks
   section. For Army multi-stop missions, where the forecast for all stops is similar, enter
   "A/S" (for "all stops"), enter the worst conditions expected along the route, and identify the
   location having the worst condition. These entries imply conditions at all other stops are the
   same, or better.
   A2.4.2. Block 27. VALID TIME. For USAF and Navy/Marine missions, enter valid time
   as 1 hour either side of ETA. For flights less than 1 hour, the valid period will be ETD to
   ETA plus 1 hour. Briefings for Army missions require a valid time from ETA through 1
   hour after ETA. For "A/S" entries, valid times are determined from original ETD to last stop
   ETA plus 1 hour.
   A2.4.3. Block 28. SFC WIND. Enter true wind direction if the destination is an airfield
   other than your own. If the flight departs from and terminates at your own airfield with no
   intermediate stops, enter the wind direction magnetic. Designate "M" for magnetic" or "T"
   for true. Enter the wind direction to the nearest 10 degrees, and speed (including gusts) to
   the nearest whole knot. For "A/S" missions, enter the highest wind speed expected
   (including gusts) and the location.
   A2.4.4. Block 29. VSBY/WEA. Enter the lowest prevailing visibility and weather expected
   during the valid period. Represent in statute miles for CONUS and overseas US locations,
   and in meters for other overseas locations, unless otherwise specified by the aircrew.
   A2.4.5. Block 30. CLOUD LAYERS. Enter the lowest prevailing sky condition expected
   during the valid period. Weather briefers must fully evaluate all NWS probability groups
   (i.e. PROB30/40%) and indigenous variations of the TAF code. If necessary, use the
   Remarks section to record the briefer’s assessment and translation of these conditions.
   A2.4.6. Block 31. ALTIMETER/RWY TEMP/PRES ALT. Enter the lowest altimeter
   setting expected during the valid period in all cases except those in which it is impossible to
   obtain or determine. Enter the forecast temperature (RWY TMP) and designate degrees
   Celsius or Fahrenheit used (prefixed with a “+” or “-” as applicable). Enter the forecast
   pressure altitude (PRES ALT) for the arrival time at the destination.

                 EXAMPLE MOAF AND CONTROLLING MWP (CMWP)

A5.1. General. Figure A5.1 contains suggested weather parameters for various A/N MOAFs.
The CMWP in Figure A5.2 contains several different MOAFs for specific missions conducted
within one large multiple-unit operation. In this example, the individual MOAFs are combined
to form the official CMWP developed by the lead weather unit. The lead weather unit aligned
with the C2 element will coordinate the CMWP with all weather units supporting missions
participating in the multiple-unit operation. These weather units will produce a MWP from the
information in the CMWP. See Chapter 1, Coordinated Weather Operations, for detailed
guidance. Figures A5.3 and A5.4 provide examples of MOAFs functioning as the official
CMWP for a multiple-unit operation.
