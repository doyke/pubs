                               GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. This AFI provides policy for operating the C-38 aircraft. It is an original source
   document for many areas but, for efficacy, restates information found in aircraft flight
   manuals, flight information publications (FLIP), and other Air Force directives. When
   guidance in this AFI conflicts with another basic/source document, that document takes
   precedence. For matters where this AFI is the source document, waiver authority is In
   Accordance With (IAW) paragraph 1.4 of this AFI. For matters where this AFI repeats
   information in another document, follow waiver authority outlined in the basic/source

                                           Chapter 2

                               COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of
the following C2 centers: 618 Tanker Airlift Control Center (618 TACC), Pacific Air Forces
(PACAF) or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) Air and Space Operations Centers
(AOCs), Air National Guard (ANG) Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
Command Center, theater Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC), Air Mobility Division
(AMD), Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Special Air Missions Division,
Office of Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, USAF (CVAM), Unit Command Posts, Air Mobility
Control Centers (AMCC), Contingency Response Groups (CRG), Contingency Response
Elements (CRE), and Special Tactics Teams (STT). C2 centers are action agents for the MAF
commander with execution authority (operational control) over mobility missions/forces.
2.2. Mission Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over
MAF resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution
authority formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or
C2 staff. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training missions and may approve
transition training on positioning/depositioning legs in coordination with the appropriate office
(CVAM, AMD, NGB/A3, WHMO, etc). The pilot in command will execute missions operating
outside normal communication channels (use last known mission orders or best course of action).
   2.2.1. AMC. All active duty operational units, including the Presidential Airlift Group
   (PAG) (part of the 89th Airlift Wing (89 AW), are aligned under 18 AF. CVAM is
   responsible for tasking and scheduling CONUS-based VIP aircraft other than Presidential
   Airlift. All requirements involving movement of VIP aircraft are coordinated with
   AF/CVAM, through unit C2 staff. Unit C2 staff serve as the single point-of-contact (POC)
   within the wing for mission assignments from AF/CVAM. Unit current operations or SOC
   provide support to the wing commander to ensure missions are planned between the PIC and
   CVAM. During the execution phase, mission changes are passed from the on-board contact
   to the PIC, who will assess impact to the crew (crew rest, crew duty day, weather, airfield
   suitability, etc.). PIC will forward the request to unit C2, then to CVAM for approval. PIC
   must ensure the on-board contact is aware that final approval is from CVAM.
   2.2.2. USAFE/PACAF.        Tasking and execution approval will be IAW command/local
   supplements.
   2.2.3. ANG. Mission validation from AF/CVAM will be received through NGB/A3XE.
   ANGRC/CC controls 201 AS missions in liaison with AF/CVAM for C2 of CVAM tasked
   missions. JOSAC is execution authority for OSA missions. Unit C2 acts as a 24 hour POC.
   2.2.4. PAG/Presidential Support. WHMO is responsible for tasking Presidential Aircraft
   and Presidential Flight Support Aircraft. Non-operational PAG flights that are ―atypical‖ in
   any respect, including those that have any unique aspects or that may attract public or media
   interest, concern or criticism, must be reported at least ten days in advance, if feasible,
   through the AMC chain of command and approved by AMC/CC or AMC/CV following
   coordination with AMC/A3, PA and JA. Details concerning routine non-operational PAG
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                     15


   flights (flights that are not ―atypical‖ in any respect) will be reported to 89 AW/CC prior to
   the mission.
   2.2.5. Off-Station Trainer (OST). The Wing Commander (WG/CC) is mission approval
   authority for unit OST‘s (may be delegated to the OG/CC or equivalent). Commanders will
   carefully review proposed OST itineraries to weigh costs/benefits and minimize impact and
   maximize benefit to the unit‘s aircrew training program. Forward approved OST itineraries
   to NGB/A3XE before mission departure.
2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an
aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights,
on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable
supplements. This includes AC upgrade candidates on an Operational Mission Evaluation
(OME). An unqualified or non-mission ready pilot may not be designated as PIC. PICs are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly
   events authorized in the mission tasking unless, in the PIC‘s judgment, an emergency
   condition demands otherwise. Fly unscheduled training events (for example, air refueling
   (AR) or transition training) after obtaining approval of the execution authority.
   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents. PICs
   will inform C2 agents of factors that may impact mission accomplishment. When transiting
   a stop without a C2 agent, the PIC shall enter mission information into the C2 system by the
   most expeditious means available. PICs will establish a POC with the appropriate C2 agent
   prior to entering crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support
   requirements on the PICs behalf.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
   and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
   crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on
   the PIC‘s behalf.
   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP),
   passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
   2.3.8. Responsible for the safe, comfortable, and reliable accomplishment of the mission. It
   is imperative that the aircrew notify the PIC of all issues that may affect the mission.
   Aircrews are empowered to make decisions for safety at any time, then notify the PIC of
   actions taken.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The PIC has final responsibility for safe conduct of the
mission and possesses full authority for all mission operational decisions. Conduct all flights
with the priorities of SAFETY first, passenger COMFORT second, and schedule
RELIABILITY third.
   2.4.1. Mission Confirmation. Prior to the first leg of each mission, the PIC will review the
   mission itinerary, landing locations, other applicable mission requirements with the onboard
 16                                                         AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


   contact. Any itinerary discrepancies must be resolved before departure with the C2 agency
   and mission execution authority through the appropriate C2 channels.
   2.4.2. Reroutes and Diverts. PICs may reroute or divert their missions if required due to
   emergency situations, adverse weather or other unforeseen circumstances. Attempt to
   coordinate mission diversions in advance with the C2 agency, tasking agency, and dispatch
   function (if applicable). Before directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the C2 agency
   should ensure the PIC is provided existing and forecast weather, Notice to Airmen
   (NOTAM), Airfield Suitability and Restriction Report (ASRR) information and airfield
   security/Phoenix Raven requirements. If the planned alternate becomes unsuitable while
   enroute, the PIC will coordinate with the C2 agency for other suitable alternates. The C2
   agency will coordinate with customs and ground service agencies to prepare for arrival. The
   PIC is the final authority on the suitability of an alternate airfield.
   2.4.3. Mission Changes. Reroutes or other itinerary changes requested by the DV while
   enroute must be approved by the C2 agency and the mission tasking authority. If the
   itinerary changes by 1 hour or more, an itinerary change message must be coordinated by the
   aircrew/C2 to all affected agencies. Itinerary changes of less than 1 hour that affect
   diplomatic clearance windows must also be coordinated with affected agencies.
   2.4.4. Divert Coordination. In the event of an airborne diversion, the PIC will coordinate all
   required clearances, aircraft servicing requirements and aircraft security arrangements.
   Contract Dispatch/Flight Management, Unit CP, SOC, AMD will assist the PIC when
   requested. The PIC will also provide DV and party with all necessary assistance, including
   obtaining transportation and lodging.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting. The PIC will report standard Command MAF movement
information (departure, arrival, or diversion) to appropriate C2 agencies.           Onboard
communication/data equipment and Communications Security (COMSEC)/OPORD
requirements may dictate messaging methods. The PIC will establish a POC with the local C2
agency, U.S. Embassy, U.S. Consulate, or Fixed Base Operator (FBO) before entering crew rest.
   2.5.1. Unusual Circumstances. PICs will immediately notify the C2 agency and tasking
   agency of any unusual occurrences. This includes maintenance problems, aircraft
   malfunctions, security and operational concerns. PICs should not wait until arrival to send
   message if in flight communications are available. However, non-secure communications
   media should not be used to transmit sensitive information.
   2.5.2. Crew Location. Notify the C2 agency of aircrew location and telephone number
   during each crew rest and any time the crew will leave the immediate vicinity of the aircraft.
   2.5.3. Commercial Dispatch Services (CDS)/Integrated Flight Management (IFM)
   Controlled Missions. The Dispatcher/Flight Managers (FM) are a C2 conduit authorized for
   VIP missions. Contract Dispatchers/Flight Managers provide the PIC with flight plans, flight
   following, flight support and act as a C2 link to the C2 agency and Air Traffic Control
   (ATC). Communication is accomplished via digital data-link, radio, and landline
   connectivity between MAJCOM C2 with mission execution authority and the aircraft. For
   critical C2 communications, voice communications via Satellite Communications
   (SATCOM), Defense Switched Network (DSN), High Frequency (HF) communications, etc.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                  17


   are the primary method. The C2 agency will determine COMSEC requirements for CLOSE
   HOLD missions.
   2.5.4. HF Communications. HF is the primary means of access to the military worldwide C2
   network. During transoceanic flights, pilots will set one HF radio to the ATC frequency and
   use Selective Calling (SELCAL) if available. The second HF radio should be operated in
   Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) mode, if available, to support voice contacts between
   the PIC and MAJCOM C2 with mission execution authority. Frequencies for GLOBAL HF
   stations are listed in the Flight Information Handbook (FIH).
   2.5.5. L-Band SATCOM. L-Band SATCOM provides a worldwide communications
   capability (secondary to HF). PICs may use L-band SATCOM for routine unclassified
   communication. Due to large volume of traffic, MAJCOM C2 with mission execution
   authority will only forward L-Band messages when the PIC specifically requests this service.
   In this case, the L-Band message to MAJCOM C2 must include, ―Relay, no C2 agent (or
   negative HF contact) at (include station name)‖ in the message remarks. Limit SATCOM
   communications to operational traffic. Turn the transceiver and laptop on during preflight
   and leave it configured to transmit and receive messages until aircraft power down at
   destination.
       2.5.5.1. L-Band SATCOM Messages and Advisories. The PIC, or designee, will
       transmit an on-station message at the beginning of each crew duty day. The PIC will
       transmit an arrival advisory to the arrival C2 agency. The PIC will transmit (free-text
       messages) mission delay, in-flight refuel, and on/off-load reports. NOTE: For missions
       operating through sensitive or classified locations disable the Global Positioning System
       (GPS) position-reporting feature of the system.
       2.5.5.2. Computer management. OG/CC shall develop procedures for management of
       flight crew mission computers at home station. Aircrews will not leave laptop computers
       in an unsecured location.
   2.5.6. AERO-H/I. The AERO-H/I satellite voice system should be used as an alternate
   means of communication for aircraft with ALE/L-Band SATCOM messaging capability
   between the aircraft, C2 agencies, and certain ATC units. AERO-H/I voice is a backup for
   the controller to pilot datalink system (CPDLC) and C2 communications (datalink and
   VHF/HF voice). Certain C2 agencies and ATC units may be selected in the AERO-H/I
   directory.
       2.5.6.1. AERO-H/I voice may not be used for routine communications with ATC or for
       personal use. Also, due to its high cost, other communications options should be
       considered before using the satellite voice. It should be used for ATC communication
       only as a backup to CPDLC or as otherwise instructed. AERO-H/I voice may be required
       as a backup to CPDLC on certain routes.
   2.5.7. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers may be
   transmitted at the discretion of the Pilot in Command (PIC).
2.6. Mission Commander Responsibilities. For complex missions and multi-sortie events,
OG/CC‘s (or equivalent) may direct designation of a mission commander to act as overall
authority for mission execution. When so designated, the mission commander exercises
command authority over all mission personnel. Mission commanders will inform the appropriate
 18                                                           AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


mission execution authority through the appropriate C2 staffs of any factors that may affect
mission accomplishment.
   2.6.1. Unit C2 staff serve as the single POC within the wing for mission assignments from
   tasking agency. Unit Mission Operations and Unit SOC ensure missions are planned and
   coordinated with the tasking, dispatch and flight management agencies, as applicable.
   During the mission planning phase, these agencies are the link between the PIC, C2 agency
   and MAJCOM with mission execution authority.
       2.6.1.1. For all multi-ship operations, (eg., funeral runs and summits), OG/CC will
       ensure, through the unit C2, that an appropriate level of ground/flight supervision is
       provided for the entire mission. Emphasis should be placed on who is the overall mission
       commander for the operation.
2.7. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Reference 201 AS In-Flight Guide for a listing of
telephone numbers to assist C-38 aircrew in coordinating mission requirements.
2.8. Close Watch Missions. All VIP missions are Close Watch missions and receive special C2
attention. PICs will promptly notify the appropriate C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other events
that affect on-time departure and provide the local C2 (CP, flight management, dispatch, etc.) the
estimated time in commission (ETIC), planned Estimated Time of Departure (ETD), and
Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) as soon as safety allows. Local C2 agent will notify the C2
agency and mission execution authority when delays are anticipated to occur.
2.9. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DOD) to
cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-
801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, incorporates the appropriate directive
and provides uniform policies and procedures to be followed concerning support provided to
federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies. It establishes specific limitations and
restrictions on the use of Air Force personnel, equipment, facilities and services by civilian law
enforcement organizations. Report all requests for assistance and coordinate all requests from
civilian law enforcement authorities through C2 channels.

 (*). Operations Officer policy on manning overseas missions. The ability to quickly replace
 crewmembers in the event of an emergency or illness is significantly hindered on overseas
 missions. Therefore, carry an additional Aircraft Commander on overseas missions.

3.3. Aircrew Qualification. Primary crewmembers or those occupying a primary position
during flight, must be qualified (current and valid AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
Qualification) or in training for qualification in that crew position. EXCEPTION: The
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Air
Force Chief of Staff, the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, Combatant Commanders, and MAJCOM
Commanders, Wing/CC/CV and OG/CC are the only senior officers (O-6 and above) authorized
to perform pilot duties on VIP Aircraft. They must be rated Air Force pilots and comply with
AFI 11-401.
   3.3.1. Unit senior officers completing Senior Officer Qualification course (restricted AF
   Form 8) or orientation training for a Senior Officer Familiarization flight may occupy a
   primary crew position when under direct instructor supervision. Refer to AFI 11-401 for
   procedures and requirements governing senior leader flying.
   3.3.2. Crew members who complete the Senior Officer Qualification Course will log ―FP‖
   for Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO 781, ARMS Aircrew/ Mission Flight Data
   Document.
   3.3.3. Crew members who complete a Senior Officer Familiarization flight will log ―OP‖ for
   Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO 781, ARMS Aircrew/ Mission Flight Data
   Document.
3.4. Pilots. An IP must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining currency or
qualification (direct IP supervision during takeoffs, landings and emergency procedures).
   3.4.1. Missions with Passengers. To occupy a pilot‘s seat with passengers, pilots must have
   a current AF Form 8 for the Mission Design Series (MDS)-specific aircraft. For takeoff,
   approach and landing one of the following conditions must be met:
 20                                                         AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


       3.4.1.1. Two qualified and current pilots (1 AC or higher, 1 FP or higher) must be at the
       controls.
       3.4.1.2. A qualified pilot non-current no more than 60 days for flying currency
       requirements and an IP providing direct supervision (must be at the controls). AC‘s
       regaining currency will be designated PIC.
       3.4.1.3. A qualified NMR pilot accomplishing phase II qualification training and an IP
       providing direct supervision.
       3.4.1.4. A qualified AC upgrade candidate on an initial or requalification OME and a
       qualified pilot (FP or higher) under supervision of a qualified EP must be at the controls
       (AC upgrade candidates will be designated in command).
       3.4.1.5. A basic qualified (valid AF Form 8 in MDS-specific aircraft) senior officer who
       has completed a Senior Officer Qualification course may occupy either pilot seat under
       direct IP supervision.
   3.4.2. Qualification Training. Initial qualification, requalification, or upgrade training (AC
   upgrade training allowed) for pilots will not be conducted on missions with passengers
   onboard. Mission qualification training, OMEs, and line training/development missions may
   be conducted on missions with passengers onboard only if the individual in training is
   qualified to the applicable level.
   3.4.3. Local Training and Evaluation Missions. Non-current or unqualified pilots may
   perform crew duties under the supervision of a qualified instructor or examiner. If
   passengers are carried, paragraph 3.4.1. of this AFI applies.
   3.4.4. When unit authorized maintenance specialists and/or civilian contractors are flying in
   the aircraft for the purpose of conducting in-flight maintenance inspections, including touch-
   and-go landings, the restrictions in paragraph 3.4.1. of this AFI (concerning pilots with
   passengers) are waived for these specialists/contractors only.                 However, the
   maintenance/contractor personnel should be deplaned after completion of the in-flight
   inspection.
3.5. Not Used.
3.6. Not Used.
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles
permit an aircrew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time
   and ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
   SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Reduce FDP
   when the autopilot pitch servo fails after departure IAW information below. If the autopilot
   fails after departure, consider mission requirements and determine the best course of action to
   preclude further mission delays due to reduced FDP. The best course of action may include
   diverting to an airfield with maintenance capability. Contact C2, coordinate intentions, and
   comply with limitations. NOTE: Failure of the autopilot pitch servo does not require a FDP
   reduction on the leg the failure is experienced.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                  21


     3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 16 hours (12 hours
     when the autopilot pitch axis is inoperative). All tactical maneuvers will be
     accomplished within the first 12 hours of the FDP.
         3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
         weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
         augmented FDP, a PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
         long as:
             3.7.1.1.1.1. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before
             the first takeoff of the day.
             3.7.1.1.1.2. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate
             rest en route.
         3.7.1.1.2. A PIC with a basic crew may seek OG/CC approval to extend the FDP as
         much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled mission. If mission requirements justify the
         risk and the PIC is unable to contact the waiver authority, the PIC may extend
         maximum FDP up to 2 hours. Only use this provision to recover from
         unscheduled/unplanned en route delays/changes. C2 agents shall not ask PICs to
         exercise this option. A PIC with a basic crew may seek OG/CC approval to extend
         the tactical duty day by as much as 2 hours to a maximum of 14 hours.
     3.7.1.2. Not Used.
     3.7.1.3. Not Used.
     3.7.1.4. Not Used.
     3.7.1.5. Training FDP.
         3.7.1.5.1. Maximum FDP for training, Functional Check Flight (FCF) and
         Acceptance Check Flight (ACFs) missions is 16 hours (12 hours when the autopilot
         pitch servo is inoperative). Conduct the mission as follows:
         3.7.1.5.2. Complete all FCF/ACF checks and transition events during the first 12
         hours of the FDP.
             3.7.1.5.2.1. Crews may perform FCF/ACF checks and transition events on local
             training missions provided their time from start duty does not exceed 16 hours
             and actual flight duty does not exceed 12 hours.
         3.7.1.5.3. Crews may position/de-position to home station or a deployed staging base
         following training (do not exceed 12 hours when the autopilot pitch servo is
         inoperative).
     3.7.1.6. Technician Status. CDT and FDP include both military and civilian work and
     begin when an individual reports for their first duty period (military or civilian). (This
     does not preclude a civilian from starting a pay period prior to the report for their first
     duty period, only from showing to perform office duties prior to CDT and FDP.)
  3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform
  combined ground/flight duties. For planning purposes, 45 minutes will be used as the time to
  complete post-FDP duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-mission
 22                                                         AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


   duties within maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related duties for
   other missions when approved by member‘s home station SQ/CC or equivalent. Maximum
   CDT is 16+45 hours for a basic aircrew. If the option in para 3.7.1.1.2. is exercised, increase
   the maximum basic CDT by up to 2 hours.
   3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification.
   SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
   flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority may authorize a C2
   agent to alert an aircrew member early. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member
   reports for those duties.
      3.7.3.1. For Self-alerts, CDT/FDP begins at established showtime. The PIC shall
      coordinate early individual/crew mission report times with C2 agents. If an early report
      time is utilized, begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for duty.
      3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
   3.7.4. Deadhead Time. MAF aircrew members may deadhead for the purpose of positioning
   or de-positioning to perform a mobility mission or mission support function. Crewmembers
   may deadhead for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve
   crewmembers to deadhead in excess of 24 hours.
      3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
      flying in deadhead status provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report
      time for deadhead flight).
      3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may deadhead after performing primary crew duties, for a
      maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember‘s FDP began.
      3.7.4.3. Crewmembers must have standard pre-departure crew rest prior to deadheading
      IAW paragraph 3.10.1. and/or 3.10.2.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-
   load, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3. The duty day
   begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties. Maximum crew duty time is 12
   hours.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. IAW AFI 11-202V3, In addition, SQ/CCs shall not schedule an
aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff, or
   ALFA standby force legal for alert time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while
   impaired by its after effects.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight.
   An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as ―get-me-
   downs‖ following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight.
3.9. Fatigue Countermeasures Management Program.
   3.9.1. Aircrew may use medications with prior approval (on a voluntary basis following
   ground testing) that enhance natural rest during off-cycle crew rest periods. This section
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   23


  provides guidance for the use of no-go pills (prescription medications) that help aircrew
  initiate and maintain restful sleep during off-cycle (circadian desynchrony) crew rest periods.
  Fliers shall not use no-go pills in flight.
  3.9.2. It is USAF policy that aircrew shall never use no-go pills as a first choice counter-
  fatigue management (CM) tool. Proper sleep/rest cycles represent the primary fatigue CM,
  with ‗smart‘ scheduling procedures and napping techniques (inflight and/or ground-based)
  augmenting this primary CM. Flight surgeons will educate aircrew members about these and
  other fatigue CM.
  3.9.3. Responsibility for counter-fatigue management of aircrew medicinal products rests
  with the home station Flight Surgeon (FS) and with each individual aircrew member.
  Aircrew members may obtain no-go pills from any USAF or other authorized flight surgeon.
  Off station/deployed flight surgeons shall confirm individual aircrew ground testing results
  via the ―MAF Aircrew Medication Ground Test Card‖ carried by aircrew members prior to
  dispensing no-go pills to TDY/deployed fliers.
  3.9.4. Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs shall include use of no-go
  medication with OG/CC and FS oversight. A basic counter-fatigue ORM model is available
  for mission planners, OG/CC, crew, and FS on the AMC/A3V website. Training materials
  are available at the local FS office.
  3.9.5. Home station or deployed FSs trained using the AMC/SG-approved (lead command)
  fatigue countermeasures materials are the point of contact for no-go prescription.
  3.9.6. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will follow PRP
  notification procedures if prescribed no-go pills.
  3.9.7. Aircrew will consider the following examples of missions prone to causing fatigue
  (may cause sleep disruptions) in their decision to use no-go medications:
     3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions (with 2000-0530L show times) greater than
     four hours duration.
     3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, air-
     conditioned, and darkened).
     3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are 4 or more time zones from home station.
     3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater then 6-hour
     flight time duration.
     3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
  3.9.8. In no case will crewmembers consume a no-go pill on a timeline where they would be
  under the effect of the medication while they perform aircrew duties (use mission report or
  legal for alert time to determine latest time to take no-go medication). SQ/CC will not
  schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties during the following minimum DNIF
  periods for consuming no-go pills.
     3.9.8.1. Restoril (temazepam) – 12 hours minimum DNIF.
     3.9.8.2. Ambien (zolpidem) – 6 hours minimum DNIF.
     3.9.8.3. Sonata (zaleplon) – 4 hours minimum DNIF.
 24                                                          AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


   3.9.9. Accountability for this program is made challenging by the worldwide mobility
   mission of AMC/MAF aircrew; therefore, the following are aircrew member‘s
   responsibilities:
       3.9.9.1. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for each no-go pill and receive
       flight surgeon clearance prior to using a particular no-go pill in the flying environment.
       3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate heavy equipment or perform aircrew duties
       during the minimum DNIF period for each no-go pill outlined in paragraph 3.9.8.
       3.9.9.3. Aircrew members shall not take no-go-pills within 12 hours of consuming
       alcohol, or vice versa.
       3.9.9.4. Aircrew members will fill out an AMC-approved (lead command) ―No-Go Pill
       Usage Questionnaire‖ detailing how they used their last prescription when requesting a
       refill from the FS.
       3.9.9.5. Limit use of Restoril (temazepam) and Ambien (zolpidem) to a maximum of
       seven consecutive days and no more than 20 days in a 60-day period. In order to support
       dynamic MAF mission requirements, FS will consider providing a prescription for 60
       days (20 pills) at a time if requested by the aircrew member.
       3.9.9.6. Limit use of Sonata (zaleplon) to a maximum of 10 consecutive days and no
       more than 28 days in a 60-day period. In order to support dynamic MAF mission
       requirements, FS will consider providing a prescription for 60 days (28 pills) at a time if
       requested by the aircrew member.
       3.9.9.7. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional
       supplements and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate
       potential interactions.
3.10. Crew Rest/Enroute Ground Time. Reference paragraph 1.4.2. for the waiver authority
to waive any portion of the crew rest period or ground time as needed to meet mission tasking
IAW AFI 11-202V3 and MAJCOM Supplements.
   3.10.1. Home-Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. As a minimum, crewmembers will enter
   crew rest 12 hours prior to alert time or, when self-alerting, 12 hours prior to reporting time.
   For missions that will keep aircrew members off station 16 hours or more, unit commanders
   will enter primary and deadhead aircrew members into pre-departure crew rest 24 hours
   before the LFA time. Aircrew members deadheading to join a mission via commercial travel
   are entitled to 24 hours of pre-departure crew rest prior to reporting at the commercial
   airport. Aircrew members (including those that will be travelling via commercial means
   prior to joining a mission) may perform limited non-flying duties during the first 12 hours of
   pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12 hours of pre-
   departure crew rest. Do not manifest deadhead aircrew members as passengers to deny pre-
   departure crew rest. EXCEPTION: ANG aircrews will comply with the provisions in AFI
   11-202V3 and appropriate supplement regarding home station pre-departure crew rest.
   3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The crew rest period is normally a minimum 12-
   hour non-duty period before the FDP begins. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12
   hours before scheduled report time (for exceptions, reference para 3.10.3. of this AFI). This
   provides aircrews at least 8 hours to sleep plus 4 hours to travel, relax, and dine.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                  25


     3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3 with mission
     execution authority, C2 agents shall not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When
     necessary to interrupt aircrew members‘ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a
     subsequent minimum 12 hour crew rest period after they complete official duties.
     3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
     flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, aircraft
     preparation, aircrew arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
  3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. A minimum 15 hour ground time between block-
  in to block-out should normally be planned. OG/CC is waiver authority for missions in
  planning phase to no less than 12 hours from block-in to block-out. For missions in
  execution, the PIC may waive to no less than 12 hours from block-in to block-out to
  accommodate special CVAM/AMD/DV requests. Do not plan consecutive 12 hour-to-12
  hour crew rests.
     3.10.3.1. Before reducing normal ground time consider mission preparation time and
     other factors peculiar to the mission. Reference paragraph 1.4.2. for the waiver authority
     to reduce crew rest to less than 12 hours from block-in to block-out. It is not to be used
     for DV scheduling convenience.
     3.10.3.2. Ground time reduction will ensure aircrew is afforded 8 hours of uninterrupted
     sleep and adequate time for transportation and meals.
     3.10.3.3. PIC will notify the tasking agency and C2 of all modifications to ground time.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides aircrews a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
  report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and
  are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve PIC requests
  to delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when
  mission allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the
  reason for disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination.
     3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and parent MAJCOM/A3 may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
  3.10.6. FCC/RAVEN Work and Rest Plan. For off-station missions, FCCs and RAVENs are
  responsible to the PIC only. Aircrew crew rest rules do not apply. The PIC will determine
  how long FCCs and RAVENs can safely perform duties. FCCs and RAVENs must have the
  opportunity to rest 8 hours in each 24-hour period. For FCC work-rest plan guidance, see
  AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and associated MAJCOM
  supplements.
 26                                                          AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


       3.10.6.1. Unless specified in AFI 21-101 or applicable MAJCOM supplements, FCCs
       will only perform in flight duties/maintenance when in the opinion of the PIC an
       emergency condition exists requiring FCC‘s assistance.
       3.10.6.2. Upon arrival at en route locations the PIC will determine how long the FCC can
       safely perform aircraft maintenance duties on assigned aircraft.
   3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish parent MAJCOM/A3-approved crew rest
   waivers in the Exercise or Contingency OPORD, Operations Plan (OPLAN), or Concept of
   Operations (CONOPS).
   3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft
   parking ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive
   accurate aircrew/mission information in a timely manner.
       3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. C2 agents for MAJCOM with mission execution
       authority will forward information on the departing aircrew‘s orders to a POC for the
       next crew rest location‘s Prime Knight function.
       3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a
       C2 agent has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight
       POC. If departing from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew
       rest location Prime Knight POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
       3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure Temporary Duty
       (TDY)/Flight orders clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime
       Knight reservations in advance.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. Self-alerting procedures are normally used for all VIP Missions.
The PIC sets the crew reporting time and location. Home-station departure show time will
normally be 2+00 prior to scheduled takeoff time. PICs may change the home station reporting
time as necessary if approved by unit Mission Operations or SOC. Normally, off-station crew
reporting time is 2 hours prior to scheduled departure time. The PIC may establish reporting
times as required for mission accomplishment (e.g. scheduled mission departure time changes,
increased travel time from hotel to plane, customs, etc).
   3.11.1. The latest allowable alert time for an aircrew given a legal for alert time (e.g. as a
   maintenance back-up) is 6 hours after the expected alert time. The PIC may extend that
   window to 8 hours when flying as the primary crew or 12 hours when dead-heading. The
   controlling C2 agency will not ask the PIC to accept more than the 6 hour window.
3.12. Stage Management. VIP missions may require stage crews. When a stage crew is
needed due to flight duty period limitations, maintenance difficulties, etc., ensure unit validates
the requirement and assists in determining transportation requirements, in place times, mission
specific details, etc.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. C2 Agents for MAJCOM with mission execution authority shall
task units for Standby Force Duty not later than 18 hours prior to legal for alert time. This
allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty.
When aircrews are unable to complete all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time,
provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to
provide 18 hours prior notification, the SQ/CC shall place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                       27


rest and follow aircraft generation procedures in paragraph 3.7.5. of this AFI to prepare the
aircraft for launch. The SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours.
After 48 hours, C2 must launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure crew rest.
Reference paragraph 1.4.2. for the waiver authority to extend this period for contingencies.
Standby/Alert Force Duty shall not be used as a tool to eliminate pre-departure crew rest.
   3.13.1. ALFA Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as
   an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour. Once SQ/CC forms an ALFA
   Standby Force, that aircrew will accomplish follow-on pre-flights required by the AFM.
   Follow-on pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. Begin
   CDT/FDP when C2 agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while performing
   pre-flight (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
   aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours (normally 1 hour to show
   and 2 hours to perform preflight duties). Follow-on pre-flights, if required, interrupt crew
   rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews or enter them into 12 hours crew rest
   for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent standby force duty.
   3.13.4. Wing Standby/Alert Duty. OG/CC‘s and unit C2 with mission execution authority
   determine Standby/alert status and initiate scheduling procedures if needed.
       3.13.4.1. VIP Standby/alert crews should perform standby/alert duty at home. At their
       discretion, standby/alert crewmembers are permitted to perform up to 4 hours of on-base
       duties each 24-hour standby/alert period; they are not limited to staying at home for their
       entire duty period. Although not limited to staying at home, standby/alert aircrew must
       be capable of proceeding directly to the unit immediately upon notification (response
       times will be published in unit supplements/OIs). Alert crewmembers quartered off base
       may be required to perform alert duty on base if travel time between quarters and the alert
       aircraft jeopardizes alert reaction time. Assigning quarters on base must be coordinated
       through the squadron operations officer.
       3.13.4.2. The primary method of contact will always be the telephone. Ensure alerting
       organization has an operable and reachable contact phone number. Pagers/beepers will
       only be used as a backup method of contact.
       3.13.4.3. Commanders will not require crewmembers to perform any duties other than
       standby/alert duty during standby/alert.
       3.13.4.4. Crew Rest. Crewmembers are given 12 hours of pre-standby/alert crew rest
       prior to assuming Alpha or Bravo alert. Crews are legal for mission reporting after pre-
       standby/alert crew rest. Preflight duties, if required, interrupt crew rest. In no case will a
       crewmember be placed on Alpha or Bravo standby/alert duty within 12 hours of the
       previous flight duty period.
 28                                                         AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


       3.13.4.5. Schedule standby/alert crews to have the most flexible crew complement for
       the maximum applicable CDT/FDP. Notify unit C2 and the tasking authority if any part
       of a crew complement cannot be manned at the applicable manning level.
       3.13.4.6. Response Time. Tasking authority (through unit C2), will determine the
       aircraft alert requirements unless previously specified. Normal alert response time for
       VIP Aircraft is 2 hours. Tasked units will ensure an alert crew is available for the C-38
       and a backup aircraft if required.
       3.13.4.7. Standby/alert crewmembers will not fly local missions while on alert. OG/CC
       or equivalent (with tasking authority/C2 concurrence) may waive this requirement. VIP
       or contingency missions may be flown following the local if crew rest and CDT/FDP
       limitations per this AFI are followed.
       3.13.4.8. Crewmembers will not be scheduled for more than 3 consecutive standby/alert
       duty periods.
       3.13.4.9. Reference paragraph 1.4.2 for the waiver authority to waive all or any part of
       alert crew rest period. Post standby/alert crew rest waiver procedures are the same as
       PMCR. On completion of standby/alert duty, aircrew members may be dispatched on a
       mission.
   3.13.5. Pre-Departure Standby/alert duty. Standby/alert duty and pre-departure crew rest
   may be concurrent if notification is provided at least 12 hours prior to mission reporting.
       3.13.5.1. If started, post-standby/alert crew rest must be completed before the start of
       pre-departure crew rest.
       3.13.5.2. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the post-mission
       crew rest time on standby/alert time plus mission time.
   3.13.6. Post-Standby/Alert Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission
   following Alpha or Bravo standby/alert duty will receive post-mission standby/alert crew rest
   as follows:
       3.13.6.1. If standby/alert duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
       computed from this standby/alert time on the same basis as for mission time.
       3.13.6.2. If standby/alert duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized.
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation,
AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit
current and qualified aircrew members from one unit to perform primary aircrew duties on
another unit‘s aircraft. NGB/A3 has delegated approval authority to wing commanders for active
duty/AFRC interfly with ANG. Participating aircrews shall use guidelines established by the
lead command or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS. Conduct interfly operations as
follows:
   3.15.1. OG/CC‘s or equivalent may authorize interfly of aircrews and/or aircraft. Normally
   interfly should be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special circumstances but may
   be used to relieve short-term qualified manpower shortfalls, or in Combined Command
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                  29


   Operations (ref. paragraph 1.5.1. of this AFI). Long-term interfly arrangements may be
   found in command-to-command Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) or Letters of
   Agreement (LOAs). Associate Reserve units and active duty HQ Staff/MAJCOM Staff
   evaluation or inspection teams have existing interfly arrangements. Interservice agreements
   on like aircraft must be approved by parent MAJCOM A3s and other service equivalents.
   3.15.2. Interfly is authorized under the following conditions:
       3.15.2.1. Aircraft ownership is not transferred.
       3.15.2.2. Aircrew shall be current and qualified in the MDS (aircraft and model), as well
       as unique systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission.
       3.15.2.3. Aircrew members will follow operational procedures established by the lead
       command for the MDS. The Mission Commander or PIC will brief MAJCOM-specific
       items. The aircraft owning unit will direct appropriate operations instructions and
       restrictions, as appropriate, for the aircrew members who interfly.
3.16. Mission Essential Personnel. Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are authorized
MEP status on any mobility aircraft to accomplish training, evaluation, or pre-/de-position in
support of mobility operations. MAJCOM designated crewmembers who are assigned or
authorized to accompany the normal crew complement are allowed MEP status.
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in MEP status are not authorized to:
       3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Travel in this status while on leave. EXCEPTION: ANG Air Technicians
       may be in a civilian leave status while traveling en route to perform in a military duty
       status.
       3.16.1.4. Travel on VIP Aircraft unless authorized by the tasking authority through the
       PIC.
       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically
       restricted by the mission directive (mission cut).
       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by the
       tasking authority through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All MEPs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing MEP
   status. OG/CC may authorize MEP status for unit assigned mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other MEP. The
   priority for evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, then squadron level.
   3.16.4. MEPs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of MEPs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the PIC will coordinate with home
   station C2 before seating MEPs in the passenger compartment. Seats not previously assigned
   may only be used for MEPs with tasking agency approval. 3.16.5. The PIC or designated
   representative will brief MEPs on seat assignment, appropriate mission information,
   emergency procedures including egress, and armed crewmembers.

                        AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. The ultimate objective of the aircraft maintenance team is to provide an aircraft
for launch with all equipment operational (Fully Mission Capable). Lack of available spare
parts, skilled technicians, and manpower limitations have a negative and direct impact on
mission accomplishment. However, redundant systems may allow safe operation with less than
all equipment operational for certain missions under specific circumstances. VIP Aircraft MELs
are provided in separate publications The PIC, using the following policies, determines an
aircraft's overall status. Make a detailed explanation of the discrepancy in the AFTO 781A,
Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, include the following maintenance identifiers to
effectively communicate aircraft status:
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). An item, system, or subsystem component essential for safe
   aircraft operation or mission completion will be designated ME by the PIC. A PIC accepting
   an aircraft (one mission or mission segment) without an item or system does not commit that
   PIC (or a different PIC) to subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). An item, system or subsystem component, which is not
   currently essential for safe aircraft operation or mission completion, will be designated as
   MC. MC discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity to the extent that
   maintenance skills, ground time, and spare part availability permit. If circumstances change,
   an MC item may be upgraded to ME status. In the PIC's judgment, if mission safety would
   be compromised by the lack of any component, re-designate the component as ME. Do not
   delay a mission to correct an MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). Discrepancies not expected to adversely impact the current mission
   or any subsequent mission are designated as OIs. These items receive low priority and are
   normally worked at home station.
   4.1.4. Engine performance, aircraft attitude, vertical velocity indications, altitude, speed, and
   heading instruments should be operative in both pilot positions. For instruments with both
   analog and digital displays, either the analog or digital presentation is acceptable.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. It would be impractical to prepare a list that
would anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunction and contingent
circumstances. As such, commercial derivatives have extensive MELs that provide guidance to
make safe dispatch decisions with VIP Aircraft.
   4.2.1. Description. The aircraft MEL lists the minimum equipment and systems to launch
   the aircraft under routine operations. The list does not necessarily include all equipment or
   systems essential to airworthiness (e.g. rudder, ailerons, elevators, flaps, tires, etc.). The
   MEL shall not conflict with the AFM or USAF/MAJCOM directives. Those items that state
   a minimum requirement and have no listed exceptions are grounding items.
   4.2.2. Waiver Authority. PICs must refer to their aircraft MEL or Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA) approved Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) for inoperative
   systems before dispatch. Deviations must be approved by the unit OG/CC (or equivalent)
   prior to departure. Coordinate with unit stan/eval, system program directors, aircraft
32                                                         AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


  manufacturers and maintenance personnel. Safety-of-flight is paramount. MAJCOM
  Stan/Eval shall be informed of all granted MEL deviations within 24 hours of departure.
  4.2.3. The PIC is responsible for exercising the necessary judgment to ensure aircraft are not
  dispatched with multiple items inoperative that may result in an unsafe degradation and/or an
  undue increase in crew workload. The possibility of additional failures during continued
  operation with inoperative systems or components shall also be considered. This chapter is
  not intended to allow for continued operation of the aircraft for an indefinite period with
  systems/subsystems inoperative.
     4.2.3.1. System components required to complete emergency procedures and associated
     warning systems will be operational. All emergency equipment will be installed unless
     specifically exempted by mission requirements/directives (e.g., depot inputs with
     minimum survival kits). One time flight authorizations to repair facilities may be
     authorized for primary crewmembers only. For all one time flight authorizations, notify
     MAJCOM Stan/Eval of OG/CC actions. NOTE: Do not accept an aircraft from
     factories, modification centers, or depots unless all instruments are installed and
     operative.
  4.2.4. Off Station Waiver Policy.          PICs will consider route segment (navigation
  requirements, terrain, weather, etc.) when determining required equipment to safely navigate
  and operate the aircraft. If, after exploring all options, the PIC determines a safe launch is
  possible with an MEL item inoperable the PIC shall request an OG/CC waiver. Use C2
  channels to notify the appropriate tasking agency of intentions. Plan a minimum 1-hour
  response from unit stan/eval (OGV or equivalent) to respond to the waiver request.
  4.2.5. Off-Station Maintenance Difficulties. PICs with maintenance difficulties away from
  home station will coordinate all requirements for supply and maintenance assistance with
  local support agencies and unit maintenance support agencies. Do not accept aircraft parts or
  maintenance without thorough coordination with home station C2 and maintenance agencies.
  Keep unit C2 centers informed of current aircraft status through CP channels. If an aircraft
  arrives at any station with a maintenance status that would prevent or delay departure, the
  PIC will take whatever action is necessary to have aircraft restored to MR status as soon as
  possible after landing, regardless of scheduled ground time. Aircraft must be MR as soon as
  possible to support DV schedule changes or diversion to a higher priority mission. The PIC
  will monitor maintenance and report when the aircraft is restored to MR status.
     4.2.5.1. If parts are required, advise unit C2 that supply assistance is required. The PIC
     may be provided a contact that can arrange for parts locally. If parts will be shipped, C2
     (CP, AMD, etc.) will provide the aircrew with shipping details. Normally, parts are
     shipped to the PIC in care of the U.S. Embassy or other mission supply activity. The PIC
     or embassy will make arrangements to have someone pickup the shipment as soon as
     possible after it arrives. When the parts shipment has been received, notify unit C2 to
     preclude unnecessary tracing actions.
     4.2.5.2. If maintenance assistance is required beyond the scope of local capabilities,
     advise unit C2 of anticipated requirements. If necessary, maintenance specialists will be
     dispatched from home unit.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                     33


       4.2.5.3. Parts are furnished by the Contractor Operated Maintenance Base Supply
       (COMBS) facilities. All repairable parts must be returned to the COMBS facilities. The
       PIC will ensure the defective parts are returned to home unit upon the aircraft from which
       they were removed or by the most advantageous means available. The PIC will relay the
       method of shipment and name/phone number of the local contact, if applicable, to unit
       C2. Ensure the crew chief attaches AFTO 350, Repairable Item Processing Tag to each
       defective part upon removal. Coordination for supply support will be arranged through
       the contractors support facilities at other stations.
   4.2.6. Maintenance Delay. If a maintenance condition exists that will prevent or delay a VIP
   departure, the PIC will advise C2 centers immediately. Depending on DV desires and the
   urgency of their schedule, the PIC, the on-board contact, and unit C2 will coordinate a new
   departure time. PIC, in coordination with unit C2 and/or MAJCOM C2 with mission
   execution authority, shall arrange substitute transportation if available and acceptable to the
   DV.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waiver to operate with degraded equipment exceeding this chapter and
the aircraft MEL/MMEL will be coordinated through unit C2 centers in coordination with unit
stan/eval and waiver approval through unit OG/CC or equivalent. Notify MAJCOM Stan/Eval
with mission execution authority at the earliest opportunity (within 24 hours of departure).
4.4. Technical Assistance Service. The PIC may request (at anytime in the decision process)
technical support from their home unit stan/eval, MAJCOM/A3 staff, and maintenance
representatives to include commercial derivative engineering support.
   4.4.1. PICs electing to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems (with
   appropriate waiver) must coordinate mission requirements (i.e. revised departure times, fuel
   requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.) with C2 centers prior to flight.
   4.4.2. When it is necessary to protect the crew or aircraft from a situation not covered by this
   AFI and immediate action is required, the PIC may elect to deviate according to paragraph
   1.4 of this AFI. Report deviations (without a pre-approved waiver), through channels to
   MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority within 48 hours. Units must be prepared to
   collect background information and submit a followup written report upon request.
4.5. One-Time Flights. If an aircraft has a safety-of-flight condition beyond the immediate or
final repair capability of an en route facility, temporary repairs may be made to allow a one-time
flight to a pre-selected facility capable of final repair.
   4.5.1. PIC's Recommendation. PICs will send their recommendations to C2 centers.
   4.5.2. Approval Authority. MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority is approval
   authority for one-time, safety-of-flight conditions with passengers on board. EXCEPTION:
   OG/CC is approval authority for one-time, safety-of-flight conditions without passengers on
   board. Notify parent MAJCOM Stan/Eval of actions at the earliest opportunity.

                              OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. MDS specific checklists are designed as clean up checklists, and items may be
accomplished prior to the checklist being read. A checklist is not complete until all items have
been accomplished. Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and
deviations specified in the AFM, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or
limitations may be added to the checklists (in pencil). Currency of notes is the crewmember‘s
responsibility and may be evaluated.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM Stan/Evals shall approve the use of checklist inserts to
   supplement AFMs. If the AFM is a TO, approval will be IAW AFI 11-215, USAF Flight
   Manuals Program (FMP). If the AFM is a commercially provided manual, approvals will
   parallel procedures outlined in AFI 11-215. For AMC and AMC gained units, AMC/A3V is
   the checklist insert approval authority. These inserts may be placed in an in-flight guide or at
   the end of the checklist. All proposed checklist inserts must have a POC. If any crew
   member has recommendations or changes they should contact the POC. Submit changes to
   the AFM to MAJCOM Stan/Eval and provide copies to HQ AMC Stan/Eval for final
   approval. Local in-flight guides and inserts not affecting AFM guidance and procedures may
   be locally approved by OG/OGV or equivalent.
   5.1.2. Flight Operations Manuals (FOM) and Quick Reaction Checklists (QRC) are
   authorized. AF Form 847 will be processed through MAJCOM Stan/Eval for revision
   approval.
5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots shall be in their seats during flight. One of the pilots may be out
of their seat for brief periods (approximately 15 minutes) to meet physiological needs.
Crewmembers will notify the pilot prior to departing assigned primary duty stations.
   5.2.1. With both pilots in their seats, PICs may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying
   a primary duty station during non-critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and
   alert). Only one pilot may be absent from their duty station at a time, except as required
   when entering or exiting the flight deck.
   5.2.2. When additional aircrew personnel are on board, the observer‘s seat should be
   occupied, preferably by a qualified pilot if available, to assist the crew in avoiding other
   aircraft during ground operations, and critical phases of flight.
   5.2.3. Unqualified pilots in qualification training and qualified senior officers may occupy a
   pilot seat during flight provided another qualified pilot is in the other seat. During critical
   phases of flight, they must be under direct IP supervision (at a set of controls).
5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight
station or jumpseat during non-critical phases of flight. Critical phases of flight are defined as
taxi, takeoff, approach and landing. In all cases, sufficient oxygen sources must be available to
meet the requirements of AFI 11-202V3. Passengers and observers will not be permitted access
to the pilot or copilot stations regardless of its availability.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                       35


5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left
or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-code) is not required to
occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
   5.4.1. AC Takeoff and Landing Policy. Conditions permitting, a qualified and current pilot
   certified as an AC, IP, or EP will accomplish all takeoffs, approaches, and landings from the
   left seat under the following conditions:
       5.4.1.1. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
       5.4.1.2. When making an actual Category (CAT) II Instrument Approach Landing
       System (ILS) approach.
       5.4.1.3. When operating to or from airfields requiring airfield related waivers.
       EXEPTION: On Operational Mission Evaluations (OMEs), EPs may allow pilots being
       evaluated to remain in the seat if the waiver is for weight bearing capacity to the ASRR.
   5.4.2. Missions in Command. Only missions where the individual is certified as an AC and
   designated as PIC on the flight orders will be credited as missions in command.
   5.4.3. Takeoff and Landing Policy. FPs can accomplish takeoffs and landings on any
   mission at the discretion of the PIC using the guidance in paragraph 5.4.1. of this AFI.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. Unless the AFM directs otherwise, the pilot in
the left seat will command gear and flap operations and the pilot in the right seat will activate the
systems. The right seat pilot will acknowledge the command prior to system activation. If the
pilot flying (PF) the aircraft is in the right seat, that pilot should command gear and flap
operations to include a go-around. The pilot monitoring (PM) in the left seat will acknowledge
the command prior to gear/flap system activation by the right seat pilot. MDS Cockpit/Crew
Resource Management (CRM) differences should be thoroughly briefed for right seat procedures
to include programming flight management systems.
5.6. Outside Observer. When available, use a crewmember to assist in outside clearing during
all taxi operations and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). If
the aircraft will penetrate a known or suspected Weapons Engagement Zone (WEZ), the PIC will
review, brief, and assign specific observer duties according to applicable AFTTP lookout
doctrine.
5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt. Use of seat belts will be as
   directed by the PIC and the AFM. The use of an Infant Car Seat (ICS) aboard aircraft is not
   mandatory. Crewmembers will assist passengers in securing the ICS in the seat. The PIC will
   be the final authority in determining if the ICS is adequately secured.
   5.7.2. Crewmembers occupying primary crew positions will have seat belts fastened at all
   times in-flight, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.7.3. All crewmembers will be seated with seat belts and shoulder harnesses fastened
   during taxi, takeoff, and landing, unless crew duties dictate otherwise. Crewmembers
   performing instructor or flight examiner duties are exempt from seat belt requirements unless
   they occupy a crew station; however, a seat with an operable seat belt will be available.

5.8. Aircraft Lighting. Set aircraft lighting IAW this AFI, AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, AFM,
AFTTPs, and applicable AOR guidance.
5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. Comply with AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 2.5.1.
   5.9.1. Portable non-transmitting devices are authorized IAW AFI 11-202V3, paragraph
   2.5.1. and include audio and video recorders, playback devices, computers, peripherals,
   electronic entertainment devices, radio receivers, and personal digital assistants (PDA).
   Navigation aid Portable Electronic Devices (PED) are covered in 5.23 of this Instruction.
   5.9.2. Unauthorized equipment (e.g., Walkman-type radios/tape players, CD players, etc.)
   will not be connected to the aircraft intercom, Public Address (PA) or radio systems.
   5.9.3. Portable Satellite (SAT) Phones. The use of portable SAT phones (IRIDIUM,
   FLIGHTCELL etc.) in flight is authorized on the C-38 in Visual Meteorlogical Conditions
   (VMC) above 10,000 feet. Until Lead Command approved, they are not authorized for use in
   Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) or to be connected to aircraft power or
   antennas. Suction cup antenna use is authorized.
       5.9.3.1. SAT phones will not be used below 10,000 feet or in IMC.
5.10. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use, to include smokeless (spit/loose)
products, is prohibited on Air Force aircraft per AFI 40-102, Tobacco Use in the Air Force. If an
exception to policy is required, it must be coordinated through HQ AFMOA/SGZP to HQ
USAF/CC for approval.
5.11. Advisory Calls. The PF will announce intentions for departures, arrivals, approaches, and
when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures and when circumstances require
deviating from normal procedures. The PM will make all advisory calls except those designated
for other crewmembers. NOTE: Automated aircraft advisory calls satisfy this requirement.
   5.11.1. Deviations.
       5.11.1.1. Any crewmember will immediately notify the PF when deviation of heading
       (+/- 10 degrees), airspeed (+/-10 kts), or altitude (+/- 100 feet) is observed and no attempt
       is being made to correct the deviation.
       5.11.1.2. Any crewmember seeing a potential terrain or obstruction problem will
       immediately notify the PF.
   5.11.2. Advisory calls: Refer to Table 5.1 through Table 5.4 for a listing of mandatory
   advisory calls, responses, and aircrew actions.

At 100‘ Above TDZE (CAT I ILS)            ―100 Feet‖ See note (4)     ―Landing‖ or ―Going Around‖

NOTES:
(1) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around.
(2) With weather at CAT I minimums on a CAT I ILS, the pilot may not see the runway
environment at DH; however, the initial portion of the approach lights may be visible. The pilot
may continue to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights only. The pilot may not descend
below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference unless
the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.
(3) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue (CAT I), or go-around.
Respond with the intention to land if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight
throughout touchdown and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
(4) If the pilot flying has stated ―landing‖ then this call is not required.
(5) Refer to stabilized approach criteria in paragraph 5.11.4.

  5.11.3. Stabilized Approach. Unstable approaches are primary contributors to numerous
  military and civilian mishaps. Stabilized approaches are essential for the safe operation of
  aircraft and are mandatory. The following criteria define specific parameters that mitigate
  risk during this critical phase of flight. This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate
  corrective actions to stabilize the approach when outside designated parameters.
      5.11.3.1. The following criteria apply to all approaches:
          5.11.3.1.1. At 1000 feet AGL:
              5.11.3.1.1.1. Aircraft is in approach configuration.         Circling configuration is
              acceptable for circling approaches.
              5.11.3.1.1.2. Airspeed is appropriate for the configuration and conditions.
              5.11.3.1.1.3. Sink rate is no greater than 1000fpm. Note: Under certain
              conditions (WX, Threats, Terrain, etc.) some IAPs and Tactical Approaches may
              require greater than a 1000 fpm descent rate.
                  5.11.3.1.1.3.1. Non-precision Approaches. Pilots should calculate a constant
                  descent gradient profile from the FAF altitude to the VDP (IAW AFMAN 11-
                  217). This is considered the safest profile and should be used to the max
                  extent possible. During a go-around, ensure descent below the MDA does not
                  occur.
              5.11.3.1.1.4. All briefings and checklists are complete unless contrary to T.O.
              guidance.
              5.11.3.1.1.5. Aircraft is on the correct track.
              5.11.3.1.1.6. Aircraft in the correct bank angle to maintain proper approach track
              for instrument, circling, or visual/tactical approach.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                    39


               5.11.3.1.1.7. Power set to maintain the descent profile at approach speed.
               5.11.3.1.1.8. If these criteria are not met by 1000 feet AGL, the PM will
               announce the deviation and the PF will take immediate corrective action. PM
               states ―1000‘ xxxx,‖ where ―xxxx‖ equates to a concise description of the
               unstable characteristic(s) which clearly relay to the PM what actions are required
               to return the aircraft to a stable platform. Examples: ―1000‘, fast,‖ or ―1000‘,
               half a dot low‖. If criteria are met, PM will simply state ―1000‘.‖
           5.11.3.1.2. From 500 AGL to the runway, if these parameters are exceeded the PM
           will announce ―Go-Around‖ and the PF will execute a go-around/missed approach. If
           criteria for stable approach are met, the PM will state ―500.‖
               5.11.3.1.2.1. Not Used
               5.11.3.1.2.2. Not Used
           5.11.3.1.3. Not Used
               5.11.3.1.3.1. Momentary minor corrections or deviations are acceptable and
               defined as:
                  5.11.3.1.3.1.1. Airspeed: +10/-5 kts from target
                  5.11.3.1.3.1.2. Bank Angle: +/- 15 degrees
                  5.11.3.1.3.1.3. Rate of Descent: +/- 300 FPM from target
       5.11.3.2. Descent Planning and Energy Management. Aircrews will ensure the aircraft is
       following the planned descent profile. All non-tactical descents should follow a normal
       descent profile IAW AFMAN 11-217 procedures and techniques in the absence of ATC
       or FLIP guidance.           All tactical descents should follow published tactical
       procedures/profiles.     When unforeseen interruptions alter the planned descent,
       immediately correct any deviations. It may be necessary to hold, request vectors, or take
       alternate actions in order to comply with the planned descent profile.
       5.11.3.3. Visual Transition. It is imperative for aircrews to review the airfield
       environment. Identify key features such as approach light type, airfield lighting,
       geographic layout/configuration of runways, taxiways, ramps, etc. To the max extent
       possible, this study will take place during the crew mission briefing and reviewed again
       prior to descent.
       5.11.3.4. Missed Approach/Go-Around. Aircrews will conduct a thorough briefing for
       anticipated missed approach/go-around scenarios. This briefing will include a discussion
       of specific crewmember duties.
5.12. Communications Policy. Recorded aircraft crew communications are considered factual
and therefore the Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to aircrews regarding their
recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to maintain a high degree
of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.12.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
   mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, flight below 10,000 feet
   Mean Sea Level (MSL) (except cruise), and penetration of a known or suspected WEZ.
40                                                           AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


  5.12.2. Aircraft Interphone/Datalink. Do not discuss classified information over interphone
  or clear VHF/HF datalink [Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System
  (ACARS)/Airborne Flight Information System (AFIS)] channels. Primary crewmembers
  will monitor interphone. Crewmembers will advise the PIC prior to checking off interphone.
  5.12.3. Command Radios:
     5.12.3.1. The PM normally makes all ATC radio calls. Normally, use only one
     command radio, plus guard. Monitoring two controlling agencies' transmissions
     simultaneously is not recommended. EXCEPTION: ILS/PRM approaches.
     5.12.3.2. In terminal areas the primary crewmembers at assigned stations will monitor
     the primary command radio unless directed otherwise.
     5.12.3.3. The pilot operating the command radios will inform the crew when the primary
     radio is changed. Also, announce the radio (if different from the primary) on which to
     monitor guard.
     5.12.3.4. One pilot should record and will acknowledge all ATC clearances. The other
     pilot will monitor the read-back. This includes all transmissions pertaining to ATC
     instructions involving departure, en route, and approach procedures. Disregard this
     procedure when ATC instructions require immediate execution or when such action
     interferes with completion of more important duties or physiological needs.
     5.12.3.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard frequencies to the maximum
     extent possible.
     5.12.3.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
     unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK and SECURE VOICE training.
     5.12.3.7. When the aircraft is in other than a normal configuration (for example, an
     engine inoperative, hydraulic or electrical malfunction, communications difficulty, etc.),
     the pilot should request simultaneous transmission of the controller's instructions on a
     single frequency approach if in a terminal area under radar control.
  5.12.4. CRM Assertive Statement ―Time Out":
     5.12.4.1. "Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers.
     The use of "Time Out" will:
         5.12.4.1.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational
         awareness.
         5.12.4.1.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
         5.12.4.1.3. Notify all crewmembers that someone sees the aircraft or crew departing
         from established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply
         uncomfortable with the developing conditions.
     5.12.4.2. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take
     the following actions:
         5.12.4.2.1. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft.
         5.12.4.2.2. The initiating crewmember will voice his or her concerns to the crew.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                     41


          5.12.4.2.3. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
          inputs relative to the stated concerns.
          5.12.4.2.4. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
          current course of action or direct a new course of action. NOTE: The PIC is the
          final decision authority.
   5.12.5. Sterile Cockpit. With the exception of cruise flight, conversation below 18,000‘
   MSL will be limited to mission, departure, or approach essential items. Every effort will be
   made to accomplish briefings and appropriate checklists prior to top of descent (TOD).
   Sterile cockpit procedures also apply during taxi and air refueling operations.
   5.12.6. Heads-up/Heads-down. Any crewmember that observes both pilots heads-down at
   the same time (other than heads-down instrument flying) shall alert the PF without delay.
   5.12.7. CRM Enhancement. PICs will conduct a CRM exercise on the first suitable segment
   of each mission. This will be done at level off on a non interference basis with other mission
   requirements. Take the exercise to a logical conclusion and ensure crew communications
   and duties are appropriate. Suggested topics are rapid decompression, oceanic contingency
   operation, emergency divert or other MAJCOM or locally generated Special Interest Item
   (SII).
   5.12.8. Critical Action Coordination. Those actions that are flight critical/irreversible in
   nature and should always be confirmed by two crew members. These actions include, but are
   not limited to, pulling the engine fire handle, placing the engine start switch to stop,
   discharging agent, and dumping fuel. The crew member performing the action points to the
   affected switch/handle and verbally seeks confirmation from a second crew member
   (i.e.‖CONFIRM NUMBER ONE‖). The crew member confirming the action looks at the
   affected switch/handle and acknowledges (i.e.‖NUMBER ONE CONFIRMED‖).
5.13. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) on aircraft will be coordinated
through unit OG/CC (or equivalent) for approval with C2 agencies (CVAM, AMD, etc). Other
pets or animals are normally prohibited. Waiver authority is OUSD(AT&L). Units are
responsible for developing guidance regarding handling of pets during flight.
5.14. Alcoholic Beverages. Dispensing of alcoholic beverages on VIP Aircraft is approved.
5.15. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements use Tables 5. 5. and 5.6

Table 5.5. Minimum Runway Length.
                         Minimum Runway Length for              Minimum Runway Length for

   5.15.1. Waiver requirements. If operationally necessary, the unit OG/CC may approve use
   of runways shorter than specified. Approval requires careful evaluation of aircraft and crew
   capabilities. Request waivers through C2 centers, unit stan/eval for OG/CC approval. If
   operations are approved, a qualified and current AC, IP or EP will make the landing and
   takeoff from the left seat. Inform MAJCOM/Stan Eval of all OG/CC waivers granted.

      5.15.1.1. The minimum runway length for takeoff or landing should not be waived to
      less than 4500 feet for the C-38.
   5.15.2. Runway length for takeoff.
      5.15.2.1. Do not attempt takeoff if runway available is less than critical field length.
   5.15.3. Runway Length for Landing.
      5.15.3.1. Minimum required runway for landing will be based on landing distance
      computed from 50 feet over threshold.
      5.15.3.2. Compute landing distance with no-reverse thrust.
   5.15.4. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Width Requirements.

       C-38             50 feet (16 meters)         25 feet (8 meters)        55 feet (17 meters)

      5.15.4.1. Waiver Authority. If operationally necessary, the unit OG/CC (or equivalent)
      may approve use of narrower runways or taxiways than specified. Approval requires
      careful evaluation of aircraft and crew capabilities, as well as airfield facilities. Request
      waivers through C2 centers and unit stan/eval for OG/CC approval. If operations are
      approved, a qualified and current instructor or flight examiner will make the
      takeoff/landing/taxi (as appropriate) from the left seat. Inform NGB/A3OM of all
      waivers granted. In all cases, AC‘s should consider deplaning a crewmember if at all
      doubtful of the result to safely marshal the aircraft.
   5.15.5. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available and stressed or authorized
   for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff.
   Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing if needed.
   5.15.6. Takeoff or Landing Over Raised Arresting Cables (does not include recessed cables).
      5.15.6.1. When conditions permit [aircraft gross weight, runway length, weather, winds,
      Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD), etc.] and the PIC has considered the potential for
      damaging the aircraft, make takeoffs and landings beyond raised cable barriers. Use the
      entire length of runway if necessary. Be aware that operations over arresting gear barriers
      at speeds in excess of taxi speed may result in damage to the aircraft.
      5.15.6.2. Do not land on a raised arresting cable. Damage may occur to the cable or
      aircraft.
      5.15.6.3. If the aircraft lands before a raised arresting cable and rolls over it, the flight
      crew should contact the tower to have the cable inspected (this does not include rolling
      over a cable at normal taxi speeds).
      5.15.6.4. Do not takeoff or land over a raised arresting cable that has been reported as
      slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, Automated Terminal Information Service
      (ATIS), ATC, etc.
  AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                     43


     5.15.7. Other Airfield Requirements.
          5.15.7.1. Consult with MAJCOM Airfield Suitability Branch (HQ AMC/A3AS for
          MAJCOMs without an airfield suitability branch) for suitability guidance. Once a
          mission is in execution, the PIC is responsible for determining airfield suitability based
          upon operational need. Airfield certification requirements are detailed in the ASRR.
          5.15.7.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A3AS for all questions
          pertaining to airfield weight bearing capacity and will review the Global Decision
          Support System (GDSS)/GDSS2/ASRR before all off-station operations for which AMC
          is the mission execution authority. 18AF/CC is the waiver authority for the restrictions in
          GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained aircraft, unless
          specifically delegated in this Instruction or AMCI 11-208. Direct GDSS/GDSS2 Giant
          Report and ASRR waiver requests to HQ AMC/A3AS. Parent MAJCOM/A3 is the
          waiver authority for non-AMC missions. The PIC is responsible for waiver compliance.
          Consult the ASRR for airfield certification requirements.
  5.15.8. Wind Restrictions. Airfields will be considered unusable for takeoff and landing when
  winds (including gusts) are greater than established in Table 5.7

  Table 5.7. Wind Restrictions.

          5.15.8.1. The maximum crosswind component during manual (autopilot off) CAT II is
          10 knots.
          5.15.8.2. Reference chapter 9 for CAT II training restrictions.

          5.15.9.1. Determine RCR versus maximum allowable crosswind component from the
          AFM. Braking Action/Mu values from the AFM define runway condition and aircraft
          capability. RCR equivalents to Braking Action/Mu values are found in the AFM.
          5.15.9.2. Operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, takeoff data will be
          based on the reported RSC or RCR for the cleared portion of the runway. To ensure
          proper takeoff performance in the event of an engine failure, the runway should be
          cleared to allow for your maximum Vmcg offset. If your required Vmcg offset either

      side of centerline is not cleared to the reported RSC, then the RSC of the unclear portion,
      up to your required offset, will be used for takeoff data computations.
      5.15.9.3. RCR Reporting. RCR information is obtained only within 20 feet of the
      runway centerline. Only the average RCR is reported. Many portions of the runway
      (laterally and longitudinally) may have a significantly lower RCR than the value
      reported.
      5.15.9.4. Wet vs. RCR. For operations on wet, un-grooved runways, use the RCR
      designated as "wet" in the AFM for all takeoff and landing data. Use RCR 12 if the
      "wet" RCR is not designated in the AFM. For wet operations on grooved runways, use
      the RCR corresponding to ―Dry‖ in the AFM.
      5.15.9.5. No Reported RCR or RSC. When RCR or RSC reporting is not available,
      flight crews are to consider a runway surface as wet when there is sufficient water on the
      surface to cause reflective glare or when rain is falling.
      5.15.9.6. Localized Hazards. RCR or RSC reports do not call attention to localized RSC
      hazards, i.e. standing water pools, snow, and sand drifts. Such hazards probably will not
      be reported unless accompanied by reduced RCR. Pilots should be alert to the possibility
      of this condition existing and, if deemed safe, attempt to avoid these hazards.
      5.15.9.7. RCR Corrections. Do not use runways with reported RCR lower than the
      lowest RCR correction contained in the AFM.
      5.15.9.8. If the runway is wet and the reported RCR is higher than the AFM wet RCR,
      the actual reported RCR may be used for mission accomplishment.
5.16. Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage (FOD)
Avoidance.
   5.16.1. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet. With wing
   walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: Aircraft at home station
   may delete wing walker restriction IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on
   the Ground, if paragraphs 1.22.2. or 1.22.3 (as applicable) are complied with.
   5.16.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   unavailable, de-plane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and
   provide marshalling. Use AFI 11-218 signals. The PIC should use marshallers, wing
   walkers, deplaned crewmembers, or a crewmember positioned at a door or window to act as
   an observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations,
   marshallers should have an illuminated wand in each hand. Observers should be in a position
   to observe wing walkers at all times (through door or windows) and communicate to the
   pilot.
   5.16.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.
   Crews should:
      5.16.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout during mission planning. Be familiar with taxi
      routes, turn requirements, and areas for potential FOD.
      5.16.3.2. Confirm that taxi routes have been swept. If a taxi route has not been swept,
      consider taxiing via an alternate route.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   45


       5.16.3.3. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
       5.16.3.4. Avoid (when possible) 180-degree turns.
       5.16.3.5. Avoid (when possible) taxi operations that would position a wing engine over
       an unprepared or un-swept surface. If it becomes absolutely necessary to position a wing
       engine over an unprepared or un-swept surface, the engine should be left in idle (to the
       maximum extent possible) until the engine is back over an improved surface. Consider
       increasing power on remaining engines.
       5.16.3.6. If it becomes absolutely necessary to accomplish a 180-degree turn on a narrow
       runway, the turn should be accomplished at an intersection of a link taxiway or at a
       designated turn around pad.
5.17. Human Remains (HR). MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority must authorize
transport of HRs on VIP Aircraft.
5.18. Fuel Jettison Procedures. Fuel jettison is limited to the minimum necessary for safe and
effective flight operations. Except in the case of an emergency, prior to jettisoning fuel, crews
will notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility of intentions, altitude, and location.
Inform the appropriate ATC or flight service facility when the operation is complete.
5.19. Aircraft Speed. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFM, and applicable AFTTPs.
5.20. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, units must implement the following procedures:
   5.20.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch Condition restrictions.
       5.20.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
       5.20.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
       only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local Instrument Flight
       Rules (IFR)/Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic pattern activity is prohibited.
       5.20.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
       Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent. Reference paragraph 1.4.2 for the
       waiver authority to operate at non-DoD airfields.
   5.20.2. Make every effort to not schedule takeoffs, landings, and low-levels from one hour
   before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the BASH phase II period. Significant bird
   hazards will be published in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR Supplement along with
   the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions.
   5.20.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, PIC‘s have the authority
   to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition. Coordinate through appropriate C2
   authority.
   5.20.4. The PIC should consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the
   mission to help minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model
   (BAM) on HQ AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized
   CONUS bird migration patterns, European BIRDTAMS, Portable Flight Planning System
   (PFPS) software overlay, and the latest news. The Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS)
 46                                                          AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


   website is another source for real time bird hazard information. Both sites may be accessed
   through the AMC aircrew mission planning portal. See AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife
   Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, for additional information.
   5.20.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit to have the
   aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Aircrews involved in a wildlife strike
   will fill out an AF Form 853, Air Force Wildlife Strike Report, and forward to the appropriate
   safety office.
       5.20.5.1. Bird strike damage cannot be accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected
       damage may result in a complex airborne emergency; only qualified maintenance
       personnel on the ground can make reliable damage assessments.
       5.20.5.2. Aircrews should not change the aircraft configuration until it has been
       determined that it is safe to do so. However, crewmember judgment should always
       prevail in any situation in making a decision concerning safety of the aircrew and aircraft.
5.21. Functional Check Flights (FCF), Acceptance Check Flights (ACF) and Operational
Check Flights (OCF). FCFs and ACFs will be performed according to TO 1-1-300,
Acceptance/Functional Check Flt and Maint Opr Checks, and the applicable AFI 21-101. FCF
flights/programs are not applicable to leased aircraft (except where specifically annotated in
lease agreement).
   5.21.1. Terms and Abbreviations:
       5.21.1.1. FCF. FCFs are performed after accomplishing inspections or maintenance to
       assure the aircraft is airworthy and capable of mission accomplishment. FCF
       certification required.
       5.21.1.2. ACF. ACFs specify guidelines for accepting new production aircraft and to
       determine compliance with contractual requirements. ACF certification required.
       5.21.1.3. OCF. OCFs will be performed to verify functionality for could not duplicate
       (CND) and non-safety of flight items. Aircraft will be at least Partial Mission-Capable
       (PMC) to perform an OCF. PIC will be at least an instructor pilot.
   5.21.2. FCF Restrictions:
       5.21.2.1. Conditions requiring an FCF typically include (but are not limited to) major
       retrofit modifications, removal or replacement of moveable flight control surfaces, major
       repairs that would affect the flying characteristics of the aircraft, adjustment, removal, or
       replacement of major components of the flight control system for which airworthiness
       cannot be verified by maintenance operational checks, or removal or replacement of an
       engine. Final determination for conditions requiring an FCF are contained in
       manufacturer‘s guidance or maintenance TOs.
       5.21.2.2. OG/CC‘s are responsible for the wing FCF program. The OG/CC may waive a
       complete FCF and authorize an FCF to check only systems disturbed by maintenance,
       inspection or modification.
       5.21.2.3. Minimum Crew Complement: Pilot: At least one FCF/ACF certified
       instructor, second pilot must be current and qualified.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   47


       5.21.2.4. Check flights should be conducted within the designated check flight airspace
       of the airfield from which the flight was launched except when the flight must be
       conducted under specific conditions, not compatible with local conditions and area
       restrictions.
       5.21.2.5. Reference paragraph 1.4.2. for the waiver authority to approve a combined FCF
       and ferry flight with degraded systems.
       5.21.2.6. FCFs and ACFs will be accomplished by the best qualified instructor/evaluator
       aircrews. The OG/CC will provide written designation of FCF/ACF qualified aircrew.
       5.21.2.7. FCFs will normally be conducted in daylight, VMC conditions. However, the
       OG/CC may authorize a flight under a combination of VFR, IFR, and "VFR on Top"
       conditions. The flight will begin in VFR conditions. If the aircraft and all systems are
       operating properly, it may proceed IFR to penetrate cloud cover to VFR on top to
       continue the altitude phase of the flight.
       5.21.2.8. FCF aborts. If a malfunction occurs during an FCF and is not related to the
       condition generating the FCF, and the original condition operationally checks good, the
       aircraft may be released for flight.
       5.21.2.9. OG/CC (or equivalent) and deployed mission commander may authorize
       temporary waivers to these FCF procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally
       necessary. Permanent waiver requests require MAJCOM Stan/Eval approval.
5.22. Participation in Aerial Events. IAW AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures,
all aerial events must be sanctioned and individually approved by the appropriate military
authority, and dated with the FAA. AFI 11-209 clearly identifies events sanctioned for support,
and specifies the approval authority for each type. AFI 11-209 also stipulates that units
participating in aerial events will ensure activities are coordinated with the FAA through the
regional USAF representative.
5.23. Hand Held GPS and Portable Electronic Devices for Navigation. All VIP Aircraft
have integrated GPS. As a backup, aircrews are authorized to carry an approved handheld GPS
unit for additional situational awareness. Use of a handheld GPS unit as an IFR navigation aid is
prohibited. An Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) is a portable tablet computer. It contains a database
of approach charts/plates for use in flight. Some EFBs are integrated into the Flight
Management Computer (FMC)/Flight Management System (FMS) or have a hand-held GPS and
suction cup antenna. Use of these devices for instrument procedures (below 10,000 feet) must be
approved by HQ AFFSA/A3OF and MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority. All non-
transmitting     portable     electronic   devices    require    Electromagnetic    Interference
(EMI)/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing for use in flight below 10,000 feet.
AMC/A3V maintains a list of approved carry-on electrical devices. Contact AMC/A3VS for
specifics.
   5.23.1. Before using the device in-flight, aircrew members must receive training and aircraft
   must be capable of supporting the hand-held GPS equipment. The portable GPS will not be
   used to update Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)/Inertial Reference Systems (IRS)
   equipment unless the portable GPS position can be confirmed by another aircraft source [i.e.
   radar, Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), Very High Frequency Omni-Directional Radio-
   Range (VOR), another INS/IRS, or navigator].
 48                                                         AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


5.24. Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). TCAS is designed to enhance
crew awareness of nearby traffic and issue advisories for timely visual acquisition or appropriate
vertical flight path maneuvers to avoid potential collisions. It is intended as a backup to visual
collision avoidance, application of right-of-way rules and ATC separation. The PIC will file an
AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR) if required to deviate due to an resolution
advisory (RA).
   5.24.1. Aircrew must comply with all RA‘s. This ensures aircraft separation computed by
   TCAS. Failure to follow the computed RA may result in a midair collision. Advise ATC as
   soon as practical when a deviation becomes necessary due to a TCAS resolution advisory.
   5.24.2. Aircrew should visually clear the airspace and obtain clearance prior to maneuvering
   the aircraft in response to a TCAS traffic advisory (TA).
5.25. Radar/Radio Altimeter.
   5.25.1. Any crewmember detecting the illumination of the radar/radio altimeter Low
   Altitude Warning Light will immediately notify the PF. Terrain clearance and aircraft
   position must be verified.
   5.25.2. Before departure the radar/radio altimeter should be set to the emergency return
   minimums altitude or the first planned approach for local training unless AFM specifies
   different. Normally, use the height above touchdown/height above aerodrome (HAT/HAA)
   for IMC, or 600 feet for VMC departures.
   5.25.3. Set the radar/radio altimeter to the HAT/HAA during instrument approaches.
5.26. Not Used.
5.27. Not Used.
5.28. Aircraft Recovery From Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not attempt to recover
an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi. Using the
appropriate equipment, ground crews will accomplish aircraft recovery. EXCEPTION: In
highly unusual situations, it may be necessary for VIP aircrews to recover the aircraft.
Accomplish recovery only if the PIC has coordinated with unit safety, stan/eval and appropriate
MAJCOM maintenance authorities through the unit C2 centers to confirm there is no aircraft
damage and the surface will support the aircraft.
5.29. Engines Running Onload/Offload (ERO) Procedures. Accomplish IAW applicable
AFM and AFTTPs.
5.30. Use of Automation.
   5.30.1. General Automation Procedures. There must be a clear understanding of the Pilot
   Flying (PF) and the Pilot Monitoring (PM) duties at all times. Aircrews are expected to fly
   the aircraft using the highest level of automation, balanced with the requirement to maintain
   basic flying skills. However, pilots are authorized to choose an appropriate level of
   automation consistent with changing flight environments. If the use of automation creates a
   loss of situational awareness or results in task saturation, shift to a less demanding level or
   disconnect the automation entirely and re-establish desired aircraft path and control. If the
   automation is not performing as expected, take over manually. Reference backup
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   49


  navigational aids (NAVAIDs) (if available) that define the procedure when using the
  FMC/FMS.
  5.30.2. Verbalize, Verify, and Monitor (VVM) is a closed-loop system of communication
  designed to significantly reduce typical automation selection errors between the PF and PM.
  VVM consists of the following three step process:
     5.30.2.1. Prior to making any changes in the GP, FMS, CDU, Altitude Alerter, etc., , the
     pilot making the entries will VERBALIZE the intended changes.
     5.30.2.2. Both pilots will VERIFY the intended changes prior to execution.
     5.30.2.3. Both pilots will MONITOR the aircraft to ensure the expected performance is
     achieved.
     5.30.2.4. The PF will announce changes to the level of automation, flight director and
     autopilot mode selections, and mode transitions to the maximum extent possible (e.g.
     ―Autopilot engaged ‖,―Altitude Hold‖, ―Nav-Capture‖, etc.). The PM will acknowledge
     the call.
  5.30.3. It is the responsibility of the crew to fully understand the operations and limitations
  of the automation on the aircraft. In flight, the PF will determine the most desirable level of
  automation for a given situation. The PM provides basis for duties to aid PF, he must
  manage PF workload, set priorities and employ the available resources, including
  automation, to help PF maintain overall situational awareness.
  5.30.4. Use appropriate levels of automation as required by the flight conditions. The first
  priority is to fly the aircraft. The FMC/FMS/Automatic Flight Director System (AFDS) and
  Mission Computer are intended to aid in workload management, not complicate it. As the
  flight situation changes, do not feel locked into a level of automation.
  5.30.5. Avoid the following common pitfalls associated with over-reliance, misuse, or
  misunderstanding of automation.
     5.30.5.1. Fixating on the automation. One pilot should always remain heads up.
     Establish clear roles for computer related tasks. Announce ―pilot heads down‖ when the
     task requires focusing significant attention on the mission computer in flight.
     5.30.5.2. Misprioritizing programming tasks. Extensive reprogramming during critical
     phases of flight or during periods of high workload should be avoided.
     5.30.5.3. Mode awareness. The PF should monitor flight mode annunciations and make
     AFDS panel changes during coupled operations. Programming the FMC/FMS should be
     verified by PF prior to coupling route to the autopilot. During uncoupled flight, the PF
     should direct the PM to make changes to the AFDS panel to match the flight director.
     Confirm all mode changes by observing the correct flight mode annunciations.
     5.30.5.4. Altitude Window. The most critically missed area of responsibility is the
     altitude window on the AFDS panel. Typically, (autopilot on or off), the PM sets the
     cleared altitude in the window and confirms the altitude with the PF. It is vital that the
     PM obtain verbal confirmation from PF after setting an assigned altitude on the AFDS
     panel.
 50                                                        AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


       5.30.5.5. Over-reliance on automation. Practice flight operations at all levels of
       automation to be proficient. If the automation is not performing as expected, take over
       manually. Reference backup navigational aids (NAVAIDs) (if available) that define the
       procedure when using the FMC/FMS.
5.31. Aircraft Defensive System (DS). Operate DS IAW applicable AFMs, technical
instructions, AFTTPs, and command guidance.
5.32. Mobility Aircrew Fall Protection. Aircrew members are prohibited from climbing onto
the upper fuselage or wing surfaces unless there is an operational necessity. When operational
conditions dictate that aircrew members must climb onto upper fuselage or wing surfaces, they
will do so only when conditions are dry and while wearing a maintenance safety harness and
properly engaged lanyard. PICs will ensure no other personnel (excluding qualified
ops/maintenance personnel) have access to, or are allowed to, climb onto the fuselage or wings.
EXCEPTION: Aircraft that do not have the ability to anchor the maintenance safety harness
and lanyard are exempt from the harness requirement until a suitable alternate is available.

                                 AIRCREW PROCEDURES

Section 6A—Pre-mission

6.1. Aircrew Uniform.
   6.1.1. Wear the aircrew uniform, as outlined in AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal
   Appearance of Air Force Personnel, on all missions, unless otherwise authorized. VIP
   aircrews are authorized to wear civilian attire and non-fire retardant uniforms while
   performing aircrew duties (this approval meets the waiver requirement of AFI 11-301,
   Volume 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program).
   6.1.2. Aircrew Uniforms. Flight crews will comply with AFI 36-2903 standards at all times,
   including while off duty. Flight crews wear the aircrew uniform as directed by unit OG/CC
   or equivalent as specified in local supplement or MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   6.1.3. Locals, FCFs, and Ferry Flights. Uniforms for local flights are specified by the
   squadron. Crewmembers on FCF/ferry/training flights away from home station may wear
   any authorized uniform combination. Crew chiefs and maintenance personnel are authorized
   to wear the utility uniform.
   6.1.4. TDY VIP flight crews will comply with AFI 36-2903 standards at all times, including
   while off duty. Clothing will present a neat, conservative appearance and be appropriate for
   the country and/or hotel/facilities being visited. At no time will crewmembers wear clothing
   with profane or obscene statements, pictures, or logos. Male crewmembers are not
   authorized the wear of earrings.
   6.1.5. Uniforms for aircraft security RAVENs. RAVENs and RAVEN augmentees will
   wear the same type clothing, military or civilian, as the rest of the aircrew. For stateside and
   overseas missions scheduled to Remain Overnight (RON) at civilian airports or overseas
   missions transiting US military bases where civilian clothing is required for travel, civilian
   clothing will be worn while performing sentry duties. The RAVEN Non-Commissioned
   Officer in Charge (NCOIC) will coordinate duty uniform requirements with the PIC prior to
   mission departure.
   6.1.6. Personnel will have the appropriate items of clothing in their possession when flying
   in Arctic and Antarctic regions and Desert regions IAW OPORD (if applicable).
   EXCEPTION: Not applicable to transoceanic flights or when staging or transiting
   Elmendorf AFB.
6.2. Personal Requirements.
   6.2.1. Passports. Carry a valid passport on all missions scheduled outside the CONUS
   (OCONUS). EXCEPTION: Unit commanders may authorize personnel who have applied
   for or submitted passports for renewal to act as crewmembers on missions not scheduled to
   transit locations where passports are required. PICs are responsible for ensuring passports
   (with applicable visas) are carried by crewmembers when required.
 52                                                         AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


   6.2.2. Shot Record. Crewmembers must maintain worldwide shot requirements and carry
   their shot records on all OCONUS missions.
   6.2.3. Driver's License. A valid state driver's license is required on each TDY where use of
   US government general purpose vehicles may be required. Crewmembers will contact the
   local airfield manager before driving on the flight line.
   6.2.4. Identification Tags. Crewmembers will carry two identification tags (aka dog tags) on
   all flights.
   6.2.5. FOD Hazards. Crewmembers will not wear wigs, hairpieces, rings, ornaments, or
   earrings in the aircraft or on the flight line. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers may wear elastic
   hair fasteners and/or pins, clips, earrings or barrettes (IAW AFI 36-2903) provided they do
   not interfere with the wearing of headsets, or the donning of oxygen equipment. They will be
   accounted for before and after flight.
   6.2.6. Flight Gloves. All crewmembers should have Nomex gloves in their possession.
   6.2.7. Flashlight. Each crewmember must carry an operable flashlight for night flights.
   6.2.8. Headgear. Do not wear headgear that interferes with donning the oxygen mask or
   smoke goggles while performing crew duties.
   6.2.9. Hearing Protection. Each crew member will have appropriate hearing protection
   available for the conditions encountered on the flight line.
   6.2.10. Reflective Belts. Crew members will have reflective belts in their possession. These
   are to be used on the flight line between dusk to dawn (or as directed by local supplement).
   6.2.11. Protective and Survival Gear. If required IAW applicable AOR guidance, the PIC
   will ensure appropriate crew members are equipped with protective gear (e.g. body armor,
   laser eye protection, etc.) and survival equipment (e.g. survival kit, escape and evasion kit,
   etc.).
6.3. Pre-mission Actions.
   6.3.1. Mission Planning and Airfield Review. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all
   mission planning, foreign clearance and en route support requirements are coordinated.
   Planning activities may be accomplished by contracted dispatch, flight management agencies
   or mission operations personnel. The PIC is ultimately responsible for validating all
   planning material prior to execution. The suggested mission planning review areas for
   aircrew and IFM/CDS/AMD include, but are not limited to:
      6.3.1.1. Airspace/Airfield Review. Aircrews will use MAJCOM approved Unclassified
      But Sensitive Protocol Router (NIPR) and Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR)
      network websites. The AMC Aircrew Portal and theater-specific websites provide vital
      links to planning. Include FLIP, Flight Information Region (fir)/Upper Flight
      Information Region (uir)/Air Defense Identification Zone (adiz), aOR, and Jeppesen
      procedures as well as study of runways, taxiways, and ramp areas. Refer to paragraph
      5.15. of this AFI for minimum runway and taxiway requirements. Check weight bearing
      capacities. Contact AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability), and/or Airfield Manager directly

54                                                         AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


     6.3.2.1. Review tasking and itinerary. When mission confirms, contact the DV mission
     contact. Inform the on-board contact officer that excessive carry on baggage cannot be
     stowed in the passenger compartment. Confirm on-board communication requirements.
     6.3.2.2. Review applicable OPORD, SPINS, ATO, Jeppesen products and DoD FLIP.
     6.3.2.3. Foreign Clearance. Review the FCG and classified FCG. Ensure the planned
     itinerary can be flown in compliance with the provisions of the FCG. If not, obtain an
     exception to the FCG through the Defense Attaché Office (DAO) or State Department
     channels or coordinate an itinerary change. Start visa processing as soon as possible.
     6.3.2.4. Flight Itinerary. Confirm itinerary times and prepare a flight itinerary. Itinerary
     leg times are block-to-block times (door closed to door open) and include time for taxi-
     out, takeoff, climb, descent, approach, landing, and taxi-in. After completion of planned
     computer flight plan (CFP), current operations/CDS/IFM will notify C2 if CFP + taxi
     block times are in excess of scheduled block times. Reference local supplement for unit
     standards and guidance for programmed (AVISOURCE, GDSS, etc) vs. CFP block
     times. Notify C2 and re-compute departure times to meet ―hard‖ block times if
     requested. In all cases, ensure forecast winds, payload and drag factors are accurately
     assessed.
     6.3.2.5. Messages. Advance notice and/or diplomatic clearance messages are required
     for all missions to destinations OCONUS, including flights to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto
     Rico. Exact requirements and addressees for each country are found in the FCG and
     classified FCG. See local supplement for additional unit guidance on message formats
     and procedures.
     6.3.2.6. Protection of DV foreign travel itineraries is required by DoD and USAF policy
     guidance. For unclassified missions operating outside the United States, US possessions,
     or Canada, do not include the name of the DV in unclassified messages or email. Make
     every effort to keep DV itinerary and trip itinerary separate to enhance OPSEC. See local
     supplement for security measures to transmit itinerary, hotel reservations and DV
     messages.
     6.3.2.7. En Route Support. PICs are ultimately responsible to ensure en route support at
     all destinations. If applicable, ensure CDS/IFM/AMD/CAOC arrange en route support.
     For most OCONUS missions, arrange support by tasking the local Defense/Air Attaché
     by e-mail or AUTOMATED MESSAGE HANDLING SYSTEM (AMHS) message. For
     all CONUS missions (and as necessary for foreign missions), PICs will confirm
     destination support through CDS/IFM/AMD (as applicable). When a mission or portion
     of a mission is canceled or changed, the PIC is responsible for advising affected support
     agencies or attaches. 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) is available for VIP
     support (USAFE/PACAF support provided by AMD and CENTAF support provided by
     CAOC).
     6.3.2.8. Coordinate for worldwide FLIP, TAAD procedures and sufficient COMSEC
     materials for the duration of the mission.
     6.3.2.9. Review anti-hijacking procedures (AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Piracy
     (Hijacking) (FOUO), and chapter 7 of this AFI).
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                    55


     6.3.2.10. Obtain terminal terrain charts for unfamiliar destinations, if available.
     6.3.2.11. If applicable, release available seats to passenger terminal (See paragraph
     6.51.1. of this AFI).
     6.3.2.12. Comply with the AMC Phoenix Raven Locations list for enroute aircraft
     security.
  6.3.3. Parking, Servicing, and Aircrew Requirements. The following should be considered
  when planning missions into certain locations:
     6.3.3.1. Guard and Reserve Facilities. On missions to CONUS civil airports with a
     military facility (ANG/AFRC) capable of providing support, use the military facility;
     however, there are exceptions. If the mission will arrive or depart outside the normal
     operating hours of the military facility (nights, weekends, or holidays) use a civilian
     facility (terminal, FBO ramp, etc.) provided you can arrange the necessary support. If the
     using agency requests use of a civilian facility in preference to an available military
     facility, use the civilian facility. If your DV party has a requirement to use the military
     facility, make arrangements to use the military facility. In general, avoid requiring
     ANG/AFRC units to work overtime in support of VIP Missions unless the using agency
     has a specific need to use the military facility or suitable support cannot be obtained from
     civilian sources.
     6.3.3.2. Contract Servicing Agents. When you plan to use civilian facilities for parking
     or servicing, refer to the worldwide merchant directory for the Multi Service Card via
     https://www.airseacard.com. Use the government fuel contractor unless you cannot
     obtain the required services. If your mission requires parking away from the contracted
     fueling ramp, try to arrange trucking of fuel/servicing at the parking spot; don't plan to
     taxi to the contracted fuel ramp solely for refueling. Use approved government credit
     card if you must purchase fuel from other than the designated government contract
     vendor.
     6.3.3.3. Border Clearance. Missions entering or departing the United States will
     normally use a regular or special foreign clearance base, a civil international airport of
     entry (AOE), or a landing rights aerodrome as specified in the FCG. Military inspectors
     at special foreign clearance bases are only authorized to clear aircraft participating in the
     special projects listed for each base in the FCG. When aircraft not participating in the
     approved special projects require clearance, the special foreign clearance base
     commander must obtain advance approval from US border clearance officials in order to
     clear the aircraft. Aircraft must not transit a special foreign clearance base for clearance
     unless advance approval is confirmed. If the mission requires, arrangements can be made
     to use any suitable CONUS airfield, but the PIC must coordinate border clearance
     inspections with all appropriate government agencies in advance. Refer to the FCG,
     classified FCG, and applicable AFIs.
     6.3.3.4. Security Support. Standard message formats include security support. If
     RAVENs are assigned to the mission, the senior RAVEN NCO can assist in arranging
     support. However, security support arrangements are the PIC‘s responsibility. If
     additional aircraft security support and/or threat suppression is required, the PIC should
     contact the applicable tasking agency for assistance.
56                                                        AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


     6.3.3.5. Aircrew Billeting. Crew integrity is a mission requirement. PICs must know
     where their crewmembers are at all times. Itinerary changes are common and often
     require immediate action by crewmembers. To provide crew control, all crewmembers
     should be billeted at the same facility at en route stops. The PIC must have a "class A" or
     equivalent phone in the room. The mission contact officer/escort and the CP controller
     must know the location of the crew and how to contact them. Crew integrity does not
     require the whole crew to be billeted together in a BOQ. "Billeted at the same facility"
     means billeted on the same base or at the same hotel complex; however, if the whole
     crew is not together, the EAC must have a room phone. When government quarters are
     available, but not suitable, use an AF Form 2282, Statement of Adverse Effect - Use of
     Government Facilities, to justify the non-use.
     6.3.3.6. Not Used.
     6.3.3.7. Advance Per Diem. Normally, advance per diem will not be paid to
     crewmembers, they are expected to use their government provided credit cards. When
     the mission requires an advance that is too large to reasonably collect from an automatic
     teller, the squadron administration section will assist in arranging advance per diem
     payments. On missions where substantial cash payments are anticipated for aircrew
     transportation and other incidental official crew expenses, the PIC will designate a
     transportation officer to receive an additional advance and be responsible for these
     payments. Refer to the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) for information about per
     diem rates and procedures to follow when applying for special per diem allowances.
  6.3.4. Other planning factors:
     6.3.4.1. The SOC serves as POC between mission operations, mission execution
     authority, and crewmembers. Contact unit SOC for coordination with mission operations
     or mission execution authority during mission planning and itinerary changes.
     6.3.4.2. All VIP Missions are considered "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" and
     crewmembers will not discuss the mission or any DV information with anyone without a
     need to know. Unclassified missions may be designated "CLOSE HOLD". In this case,
     certain mission details are restricted from normal release to military/non-military
     agencies/contracted dispatch. Clarify the applicable restrictions with unit C2 centers and
     mission execution authority prior to any mission planning or coordination activities.
     6.3.4.3. Confirm the aircraft tail number with the contact officer. Obtain the contact
     officer‘s home/cell telephone number and provide him/her with the PIC‘s home/cell
     telephone number. Notify unit C2 if the contact‘s name or phone number is different
     from the one listed with the SOC/CP printout.
     6.3.4.4. Prearrange your pre-departure weather briefing (DV weather package, ―social‖,
     etc.) IAW local supplement. Provide all details needed to prepare your weather briefing.
     Do not request (DV weather package, ―social‖, etc.) for "CLOSE HOLD" missions.
     6.3.4.5. VIP aircrews will prearrange special communications support as follows:
         6.3.4.5.1. High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS, formerly
         known as Mystic Star)/Andrews Very Important Person (VIP) HF support is required
         for all missions transporting the Secretary of Defense. HFGCS support is also
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   57


          available on a priority basis for aircraft transporting the Vice President, cabinet
          members, service secretaries, and service chiefs of staff. When HFGCS/Andrews
          VIP support is required, the PIC will ensure appropriate agencies are notified. Last
          minute requests at crew show time are not acceptable. For alert missions, the PIC
          will request the unit CP or AMD controller to arrange coverage.
          6.3.4.5.2. FM radio support is provided by the White House Communications
          Agency (WHCA) IAW established priorities.
          6.3.4.5.3. Current procedures for use of the HFGCS network and the WHCA FM
          networks are described in the 89 OG/CC Special Communications Support
          Procedures Package available in each mission kit and at the SOC.
          6.3.4.5.4. Denial of service from Andrews Airways. When denied service from
          Andrews Airways due to higher priority traffic and the aircraft is working another
          airways station, inform 89 AW CP which station you are working.
          6.3.4.5.5. Denial of service from WHCA. When denied service from WHCA on
          White House missions with a Secure Communications Required profile, notify SOC
          and advise them to contact mission operations and CVAM immediately.
          6.3.4.5.6. Prior to transiting an AOR with special communication requirements, the
          PIC should contact the unit Intelligence or Tactics office for AOR communication
          plan and, as applicable, ATO integration.
          6.3.4.5.7. Crews will notify contact officer of aircraft capabilities and the costs
          associated with the respective systems.
       6.3.4.6. Arrange for spare parts as required. PICs on extended overseas missions to areas
       where support facilities are limited may request certain spares be issued for a particular
       trip. Coordinate requirements with C2 agencies and maintenance control personnel.
   6.3.5. Not Used.
   6.3.6. Itinerary Coordination. Use the following procedures when confirming and planning
   itinerary details:
       6.3.6.1. Preposition for DV pickups. Plan to preposition for DV pickups two hours prior
       to the scheduled departure time (or as directed by local supplement/directives). PICs may
       request to preposition the night prior to an early morning pickup depending on aircraft
       and crew availability. Early preposition may also be requested to allow adequate crew
       rest prior to an extended crew duty day. Coordinate request for early preposition with
       unit C2.
       6.3.6.2. Not Used.
       6.3.6.3. Manifest Information. The PIC will coordinate with the contact when
       manifested passengers are not present at departure time. PICs shall designate a
       crewmember to review manifests for accuracy prior to mission departure. PIC‘s will not
       depart without primary DV onboard unless authorized by C2.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. As a minimum, PICs will carry current copies of
AFI 11-202V3 and this AFI on all flights. Additionally, the PIC will ensure the aircraft has a
complete set of current AFMs. All must be readily available in the cockpit during all phases of
 58                                                          AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


flight. MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority approval is required to use electronic
publications in lieu of paper manuals. All other crew positions must carry the appropriate
abbreviated checklists. Additional individual aircrew publications requirements will be specified
in local supplements.
6.5. Airfield Review. All crewmembers will review Airport Qualification and Familiarization
Manuals, audiovisual slide tape programs and review any certification airfields available prior to
departure. In addition, aircrews will review appropriate websites, (e.g. AMC Aircrew Portal,
CENTAF AOR CAOC) for all restrictions and certification policies for a particular airfield.
Contact MAJCOM Airfield Suitability and Analysis Branch for all questions pertaining to
airfield weight bearing and suitability prior to all off-station operations. Airfield suitability
waivers must be coordinated through unit Stan/Eval to MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution
authority for approval. The OG/CC or equivalent may waive the airfield certification
requirement (special aircrew certification).
6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing and Tactics Support. Before leaving home station on
missions traveling OCONUS (except Alaska and Hawaii), crews will receive an intelligence
briefing that will emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military development in
the area in which they will be flying. Crews must also receive an intelligence brief prior to
entering specific AOR. As a complement to the intelligence briefing, the PIC should review and
coordinate necessary tactics with the theater and/or unit Tactics office. In theater, aircrews
should receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a forward operating location, or en route
stop, and thereafter when significant developments occur. Report information of possible
intelligence value to the local intelligence officers as soon as possible to ensure timely
dissemination of mission reports (MISREP). In addition, the PIC should provide the Tactics
office with feedback on tactical considerations.

6.8. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF) Procedures.
   6.8.1. Review FCIF, volume 1 (index and safety-of-flight files, as a minimum), before all
   missions or ground aircrew duties. Update the FCIF currency record with the latest FCIF
   item number, date, and crewmember's initials or as specified.
   6.8.2. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF review or joining a mission en route will receive an
   FCIF update from a primary aircrew member counterpart on the mission. Instructor pilots
   who fly with general officers are responsible for briefing appropriate FCIF items; the
   instructor pilot should initial the general‘s FCIF card.
   6.8.3. Crewmembers not assigned or attached to the unit operating a mission will certify
   FCIF review by entering the last FCIF number and their initials behind their name on the file
   copy of the flight authorization.
6.8.4. Squadrons are responsible for ensuring TDY aircrews receive newly released FCIFs
which may result in mission impact.

           6.12.1.2.9. Crew Conduct. Review personal conduct in foreign areas and personal
           article security on aircraft.
   6.12.2. En Route Briefings. Conduct crew briefings en route as required. Prior to entering
   crew rest, the PIC will brief the crew on the requirements for the next mission leg. Route and
   leg briefings should be conducted for every leg prior to departure with applicable
   crewmembers or a designated representative for each crew specialty. PICs should keep on-
   board contacts informed of mission specifics, changes, problems, etc. Use the following
   checklist as a guide for en route briefings:
       6.12.2.1. Crew contact procedures during crew rest.

   contact the Unit CP or AMD prior to departure for any last minute changes, aircraft status or
   crew/passenger messages.
   6.12.4. Weather Briefings. See AFI 11-202V3 requirements. Obtain a briefing on current
   weather, trends, and forecasts for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The
   weather briefing may be documented on a DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing, AMC
   Form 181, AMC Mission Weather Briefing, IFM/Contract Dispatch crew paper weather
   briefing, or other MAJCOM approved form. EXCEPTION: Verbal weather briefings are
   acceptable for local area training missions.
       6.12.4.1. Approved weather sources. US Military weather services, FAA-approved
       (Dispatch, Jeppesen, Flight Service, etc.), or any host nation civil or military weather
       source are considered approved weather sources.
   6.12.5. NOTAM information is permitted from the following sources: US Military services,
   any FAAapproved source (Dispatch Services, Jeppesen, Flight Service, etc.), or any host
   nation civil or military source.
   6.12.6. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within or adjacent to an established buffer
   zone, the PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone
   procedures outlined in appropriate directives.
   6.12.7. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with
   peacetime and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft (if applicable).
   6.12.8. Intelligence and Tactics. Receive an updated intelligence briefing and, if
   appropriate, update the crew on changed intelligence reports and associated tactics.
6.13. Call Signs. During radio transmissions, crews will use the following ATC call signs.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   63


   6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft use the static call sign ―BOXER‖ followed by a 2-digit
   suffix assigned to the instructor or evaluator. Use the assigned static call sign on all local
   flights including depot inputs and pickups.
   6.13.2. NGB Directed Missions. Aircraft will use the static call sign ―BOXER‖ followed by
   a 2-digit suffix assigned to the aircraft commander or as assigned by mission operations.
   6.13.3. HQ USAF/CVAM Directed Missions. Aircraft will use the call signs assigned by
   the OPORD, mission itinerary, diplomatic clearance, or as assigned by mission operations.
   CVAM missions normally use the static call sign ―BOXER‖ followed by a 2-digit suffix
   assigned by mission operations.
   6.13.4. JOSAC Missions. Use the static call sign ―BOXR‖ (No ―E‖) and the last three digits
   of the mission number.
   6.13.5. For OPSEC and tactical purposes, the PIC may coordinate for call sign change with
   applicable C2.
   6.13.6. All call sign changes will be accomplished IAW AFI 33-217, Voice Call Sign
   Program.
6.14. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation. EXCEPTION: On training flights, VFR
flight rules, VFR terminal area procedures, and visual patterns will be reviewed, practiced and
de-briefed to ensure aircrew VFR flight proficiency and knowledge of VFR procedures and rules
are maintained.
6.15. Flight Data Verification.
   6.15.1. Aircrews should acquaint themselves with the mission and individual sortie
   requirements to ensure successful mission accomplishment. Wing, group and squadron staff
   should monitor crew activity and be available to resolve problem areas.
   6.15.2. Only MAJCOM approved CFPs are to be used for aircraft operations. Approved
   flight planning programs include Advanced Computer Flight Plan (ACFP), Jeppesen, PFPS,
   and those used by CDS. Every effort should be made to ensure each mission segment has the
   current wind data.
   6.15.3. Flight crews may manually compute flight plans. However, CFPs should be utilized
   to the maximum extent practical. The flight crew has final responsibility for accuracy of the
   flight plan used.
   6.15.4. Flight crews will verify diplomatically-cleared route and fuel computation for
   accuracy prior to departure. Range summary charts should be used to confirm CFP fuel burn
   rates.
   6.15.5. TOLD will be verified IAW the AFM. Use of MAJCOM approved contracted
   performance programs is authorized.
6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, AFMAN 11-217V3, this
chapter, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown
(IFR/VFR), review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument
approach plate, NOTAMs, GDSS/GDSS2, ASRR Giant Report and suitable terrain charts.
NOTE: Crews shall ensure that One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb performance calculations
 64                                                        AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


IAW procedures contained in AFMs comply with and are in accordance with AFI 11-202V3
required climb gradient guidance.
   6.16.1. VFR Departures.      NOTE: VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle
   clearance planning.
      6.16.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
      procedure for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
      methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
      requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the sortie is planned as a
      VFR flight. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and terrain are
      avoided.
      6.16.1.2. PICs will always ensure they can comply with published climb gradients OEI,
      even during VFR departures. If the mission justifies the increased risk, PICs may request
      (or the MAJCOM/A3 may direct) a noncompliant VFR departure, IAW AFI 11-202V3,
      Attachment 3. Crews must also adhere to the following:
          6.16.1.2.1. Utilize radar advisory, monitoring, or control services when practical, and
          ensure flight following by any available means (ie FSS or C2).
          6.16.1.2.2. Consider reducing aircraft gross weight and/or delaying the mission until
          environmental conditions improve.
          6.16.1.2.3. Crews must be knowlegeable of and comply with guidance contained in
          AFMAN 11-217V2.
          6.16.1.2.4. Crews are responsible for terrain and obstacle planning/avoidance and
          must climb to the Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) as soon as practical.
          6.16.1.2.5. Crews will use all available resources to mitigate risk. This includes (but
          not limited to) supervisors, ORM, aircraft flight manuals, and aircraft commander
          discretion.
      6.16.1.3. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
      ensuring all the following conditions are met:
          6.16.1.3.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
          departure route.
          6.16.1.3.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
          emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance. NOTE: If unable to comply
          with any of the above conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until conditions can
          be met.
      6.16.1.4. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of
      CONUS.
      6.16.1.5. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
      clearance and reaching the IFR MEA.
   6.16.2. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined in
   AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                 65


     6.16.2.1. If the airport does not have an authorized IFR departure method, depart VFR
     IAW VFR departure procedures in this AFI. An IFR departure is not authorized at
     airfields without an instrument approach.
     6.16.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
     are avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for
     IFR departure planning (AFMAN 11-217V1). NOTE: Screen height requirements for
     departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or the airfield where the
     departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews to determine screen
     height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those listed below, or
     when any doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at 35 feet
     (minimum) unless you can ascertain a different screen height requirement from an
     appropriate authority.
        6.16.2.2.1. Special Departure Procedure (SDP): Published on SDP.
        6.16.2.2.2. USAF/USN produced SIDs or USAF/USN/USMC airfield: Zero feet.
        6.16.2.2.3. US Army, FAA SID, and joint use airfield within the US: 35 feet unless
        published.
        6.16.2.2.4. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Military Airports: 35 feet.
        6.16.2.2.5. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Civil Airports: 16 feet or as
        published.
        6.16.2.2.6. Other ICAO nations: 16 feet or as published.
        6.16.2.2.7. All others: 35 feet unless published.
     6.16.2.3. Aircraft must meet the published climb gradient for the departure runway with
     all engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm will be used.
     NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL ENGINE climb
     gradient, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
     6.16.2.4. Use one of the following methods to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear all
     obstacles along the planned departure route with OEI:
        6.16.2.4.1. Special Departure Procedures (SDP). NGB/A3O authorizes the use of
        Jeppesen or CDS provided SDP‘s for VIP Aircraft. SDP‘s utilize worldwide obstacle
        database criteria to calculate OEI emergency gross weights, flap settings, and provide
        escape routing. SDP‘s and associated OEI obstacle routings (Takeoff Procedures)
        provide optimum dispatch takeoff weights at specified departure locations. Each
        must be specifically designed for your MDS. SDP‘s must be current. If obstacle
        NOTAM affects SDP routing, do not use the SDP. Aircrew must use the AFM and/or
        computer based performance tools for OEI departure planning. Verify aircraft OEI
        climb gradient will clear all obstacles along the planned flight path. NOTE: Use of
        SDP‘s as alternate departure routing (no emergency) is not authorized.
        6.16.2.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
        is 200 ft/nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152
        ft/nm plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not
        available, the crew must ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb
 66                                                          AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


            gradients for the selected departure, with OEI. Minimum climb gradients may be
            published as a ‗Trouble T‘ restriction in the IFR Take-off Minimums section of FLIP
            or on a SID. Operations supervisors may approve climb gradient reduction IAW 11-
            202 V3, Chapter 8. Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low, close in
            obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200‘ AGL and below) which should normally be
            published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T). Crews
            must also ensure the aircraft can clear these close in obstacles. NOTE: If the
            requirements of paragraph 6.16.2.4. of this AFI cannot be met, download cargo/fuel
            or delay until more favorable conditions exist. NOTE: For the purpose of this
            instruction an operations supervisor is defined as a Director of Operations (DO),
            Squadron Commander (Sq/CC) or designated authority by the Sq/CC or Operations
            Group Commander.
   6.16.3. Tactical Departure Procedures. If transiting an AOR and airfield with TAAD
   procedures, the PIC should review these procedures and apply tactics IAW applicable
   AFTTPs.
6.17. Weather Minimums for Takeoff. Departures with weather below landing minimums are
authorized IAW AFI 11-202V3, chapter 8. When weather is below approach and landing
minimums (ceiling and visibility), a departure alternate is required (see paragraph 6.19. of this
AFI).

Table 6.1. Takeoff Weather Minimums Runway Visual Range (RVR).
      Mission       Visibility                               Remarks
 Operational         RVR 600       When less than RVR 1600, but equal to or greater than RVR
  (Note 2)         (200 meters)    600, the crew may take off if mission priority dictates,
                                   provided the runway has a minimum of 2 functioning RVR
                                   readouts (minimum RVR 600 on all functioning readouts)
                                   and runway centerline lighting is operational. When 3
                                   transmissometers are installed, all are controlling.

  All Others        RVR 1600       For runways with more than one operating RVR readout,
   (Note 1)        (490 meters)    RVR must read 1600 minimum on all.


 NOTES:
      1. In the absence of RVR readouts, reported visibility will be no lower than 1/2SM (800
      meters).
      2. If the runway has only one functional RVR readout or no centerline lighting, the
      minimum RVR is 1600.

6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be
within the same terminal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not
restricted by FLIP, FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and
performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                     67


alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally should be used if they meet the
above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced.
6.19. Departure Alternates.
   6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if weather is below landing minimums for an
   available approach (at departure aerodrome). Do not use CAT II/III ILS minimums to
   determine if a departure alternate is required.
   6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the Minimum Enroute Altitude (MEA) or Minimum
   Obstruction Clearance Altitude (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI
   performance criteria. To qualify as a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the
   following conditions:
       6.19.2.1. Existing weather at an alternate within 30 minutes flying time must be equal to
       or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1 hour
       after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400/730m), or;
       6.19.2.2. The existing weather at an alternate within 1 hour flying must be at least 500-1
       above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than 600-2 for a
       precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for 1
       hour after ETA at the alternate.
6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will be
according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
       6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for an
       available DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach; or
       6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling or visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
       published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement
       (for example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by
       taking the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or
       as determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach
       with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet.
       6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
       for RCR.
   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the destination aerodrome is
   outside the 48 conterminous states. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do
   not exceed 3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.
   6.20.3. When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews will use 1+15 holding fuel (in
   lieu of an alternate and 45 minutes holding fuel). A remote or island destination is defined as
   any aerodrome which, due to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil
   or military) within 2 hours flying time. The forecast weather at the remote or island
   destination must meet the following criteria:
       6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
       and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
 68                                                         AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


      6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
      minimums for an available non-precision approach [excluding Approach Surveillance
      Radar (ASR)], for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a precision approach is available, the
      ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-precision approach minimums
      (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours).
      NOTE: See chapter 17 of this AFI for fuel planning considerations for destination
      requirements.
6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Turbulence. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
      6.21.1.1. Crews should confirm the type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or
      what type of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their
      route of flight. Turbulence category charts are found in Air Force Weather Agency
      technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological Techniques.
      6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
      fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
      WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
      and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
      6.21.1.3. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain
      wave turbulence.
   6.21.2. Icing. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
   operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
   NOTE: Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological
   Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is
   equivalent to severe icing.
      6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under
      conditions of freezing drizzle except when the aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced
      with approved commercial Type II/IV de-icing fluids IAW applicable AFM procedures.
      For additional information regarding USAF de-ice/anti-ice requirements and procedures,
      consult TO 42C-1-2.
      6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause
      ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-
      icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
          6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in the AFM or
          approved by the aircraft manufacturer. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all
          restrictions in the AFM with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover times.
          6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids provide little anti-icing
          benefit, and therefore have limited holdover times. As a guide, for approved anti-
          icing fluids, crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-2,
          Anti-Icing, Deicing and Defrosting of Parked Acft, and AFFSA holdover tables
          located at the AFFSA website. The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first
          applied and the PIC shall use time, temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   69


         when times are exceeded and re-apply fluid if required.            Aircrews may use
         manufacturer provided holdover tables.
         6.21.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
         completed within 5 minutes of departure. In addition to a visual inspection, a tactile
         inspection may be required within 5 minutes of departure per the aircraft AFM. The
         PIC will conduct a tactile inspection as necessary IAW the AFM.
  6.21.3. Thunderstorms. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or
  cumulonimbus clouds. If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds
  by at least 2,000 feet, avoid them by at least:
     6.21.3.1. 20NM at or above flight level FL230.
     6.21.3.2. 10NM below FL230. CAUTION: Aircraft damage may occur 20NM or more
     from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must familiarize themselves with information on
     thunderstorm development and hazard.
     6.21.3.3. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should
     only be used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather.
     It should never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively
     on ground-based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to
     provide avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
         6.21.3.3.1. Changing routing.
         6.21.3.3.2. Diverting to alternate.
         6.21.3.3.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
     6.21.3.4. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
     advected clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
     thunderstorms.
  6.21.3.5. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
  departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
         6.21.3.5.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
         6.21.3.5.2. Maintain at least 5NM separation from heavy rain showers.
         6.21.3.5.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within plus or minus
         5,000 feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level. NOTE:
         Approaches or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within
         10NMs. The thunderstorms must not be producing any hazardous conditions (such as
         hail, lightning, strong winds, gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at
         the airport, and must not be forecast or observed to be moving in the direction of the
         route of flight (to include the planned missed approach corridor, if applicable).
  6.21.4. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
  or below, refer to the FIH Section D, Temperature Correction Chart, to correct MDA, DH,
  and other altitudes inside the FAF.
  6.21.5. In-flight Weather Advisories. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET)
  and other National Weather Service in-flight weather advisories are issued for large areas.
 70                                                          AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


   Contact appropriate military weather facility or flight service station to determine mission
   applicability and impact.
   6.21.6. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
   volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least
   20 NMs.
   6.21.7. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most favorable for lightning
   strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
       6.21.7.1. Within 8 degrees C of freezing.
       6.21.7.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
       thunderstorms.
6.22. Standby/Alert Mission Pre-departure Procedures. Standby/Alert missions include any
mission where the scheduled departure time is less than 12 hours after original notification.
Procedures for standby/alert missions will vary depending on the type mission, type of aircraft
and time available between notification and departure. Procedures also vary depending on time
of day (i.e., duty hours or non-duty hours). The following general procedures apply in most
cases:
   6.22.1. Normally the standby/alert PIC is notified of an standby/alert mission by mission
   operations, SOC, or aircrew scheduler. When notified, the following will be covered:
       6.22.1.1. The mission number, departure spot, expected departure time, DV name and
       position, and number of passengers.
       6.22.1.2. The itinerary details which are available. You may be asked to confirm times,
       airports, preferred FBOs, etc.
       6.22.1.3. Fuel load requirements.
       6.22.1.4. Threat assessment, tactics and airfield security information as applicable.
       6.22.1.5. Items you want briefed to your crewmembers during notification. You should
       specify aircrew uniform or civilian clothes.
   6.22.2. For immediate launches overseas during duty hours, the SOC or aircrew scheduler
   will arrange for passports, shot records and navigation kits (as applicable) to be delivered to
   the aircraft. In addition, the SOC or aircrew scheduler will arrange an intelligence briefing
   and/or intelligence package pick-up. After duty hours, the PIC will designate who will pick
   up passports, shot records, navigation kits, intelligence package (as applicable) and confirm
   who will handle pre-launch paperwork. Normally, the duty scheduler (during duty hours),
   SOC or the CP/AMD (after duty hours) will order a weather briefing, intelligence briefing,
   and computer flight plans, if required. Current North Atlantic Track (NAT) messages are
   always available at the CP. For missions departing immediately, the duty scheduler (during
   duty hours) or the CP/AMD (after duty hours) will file a flight plan for the first mission leg.
   The crew must arrange desired dispatch/mission operations service for subsequent legs. The
   duty scheduler will assist in obtaining CFPs when requested. During duty hours, the SOC
   will coordinate with mission operations to prepare and dispatch diplomatic clearance and
   advance notice messages. After duty hours, the CP/AMD controller will arrange to handle
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                    71


   messages. If you have adequate crew rest and notice prior to departure, you may accomplish
   pre-launch flight planning yourself.
   6.22.3. The SOC and aircrew schedulers will notify the rest of the crewmembers. They will
   be briefed on the mission/aircraft numbers, departure time, where the aircraft is/will be
   spotted, required fuel load, general itinerary and number of days away, and any items the PIC
   has designated for briefing.
   6.22.4. Reporting.
       6.22.5.1. PICs normally report to squadron to pick up the dispatch flight plan, weather
       briefing and intelligence package, file a flight plan (if required), and then report to the
       aircraft. For immediate launches, one of the other pilots will normally report directly to
       the aircraft. For all other launches, one of the other pilots will normally pick up
       passports/shot records, crew orders, navigation kits, and intelligence packages (as
       applicable), then report to the aircraft for pre-launch preparation.
       6.22.5.2. FCCs report directly to the aircraft to monitor fueling and reconfiguration, and
       accomplish preflight inspections. Keep the SOC advised of any aircraft problems.
   6.22.6. Immediate Launch Clearances. Pilots should ask clearance delivery for a full route
   clearance if the IFM/CDS, SOC or aircrew scheduler files the flight plan.
6.23. Crew Station Times. Crewmembers will normally be at their duty stations with all
checklists accomplished up to the point of engine start not later than 30 minutes prior to
departure. Crewmembers will be prepared to depart as expeditiously as is safely possible if the
DV arrives early.
6.24. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in AFPD 90-9, Operational Risk
Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as
part of predeparture/preflight activities.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.25. AFTO 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
   6.25.1. Review AFTO 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft
   systems. The exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance officer,
   maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional release. If
   one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release. Ensure
   that the DD Form 1896, DoD Fuel Identaplate, and AIR card is aboard the aircraft.
   6.25.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. Refer to TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. After
   the maintenance release is obtained, coordinate mission requirements with the controlling
   agency. The PIC‘s concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown. Approval
   authority for one-time flights is contained in paragraph 4.6.
 72                                                           AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


   6.25.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support, refer to
   paragraph 16.4. of this AFI.
6.26. En Route Aircraft Preflights. FCCs, if carried, will accomplish aircraft preflights
following crew rest. If the ground time will exceed 72 hours or if the aircraft has been left
unattended, aircrews should accomplish an aircraft inspection/walk-around of the aircraft within
24 hours of scheduled departure, when practical. Anytime en route maintenance has been
performed, the affected systems will be pre-flighted and should be operationally checked as soon
as possible if practical. Thru-flight inspections will be completed anytime a preflight is not
required. Pilots will ensure flight controls are checked IAW the AFM.
6.27. Aircrew Life Sustaining Equipment Requirements. The minimum quantity of oxygen
aboard the aircraft before takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned flight from the
ETP to recovery, should oxygen be required.
6.28. Fleet Service. Ensure required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough to
permit inventory prior to engine start.
6.29. Crash Position Indicator (CPI) and Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT). CPIs
and ELTs must be operative for all flights except those remaining in the local area. If a CPI or
ELT deploys or activates inadvertently, notify ATC immediately. In the case of a deployed CPI,
if the aircraft is scheduled to fly a local or is en route with no replacement airfoil available and
the airplane is permitted to continue the mission, a locally manufactured airfoil should be
installed over the missing CPI.
6.30. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, High-Visibility Aircraft Parts
Shipments, and Courier Material.
   6.30.1. These shipments are normally not carried on VIP passenger aircraft. PICs may
   accept or decline shipments at their discretion based on mission requirements or crew or
   aircraft capabilities. Receipts will be obtained for classified cargo, high-visibility aircraft
   parts shipments, signature services, and registered mail at the on-load and off-load station
   using the cargo manifest.
       6.30.1.1. Defense Courier Service (DCS) couriers coordinating with the PIC are
       authorized to designate officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military
       aircraft as couriers to escort and safeguard courier material when other qualified
       personnel are not available. Qualified passengers, if carried, are designated before
       designating crewmembers. The following restrictions apply:
           6.30.1.1.1. Primary crewmembers will not be designated without the consent of the
           PIC.
           6.30.1.1.2. Crewmembers on aircraft scheduled to stop at locations where DCS
           couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated as couriers. This does
           not relieve the PIC of the responsibility for life and death urgent shipments.
   6.30.2. During stops at en route locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are
   required to meet designated couriers to protect the material.
       6.30.2.1. During unscheduled stops, crewmembers may place courier material in
       temporary custody of the following agencies listed in descending order of priority:
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                    73


           6.30.2.1.1. DCS courier
           6.30.2.1.2. TOP SECRET control officer of the US armed forces
           6.30.2.1.3. US Department of State diplomatic courier
           6.30.2.1.4. US Department of State activity
           6.30.2.1.5. US military guards
           6.30.2.1.6. US DoD civilian guards
   6.30.3. If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the courier material, or if
   material is lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised, report circumstances to the nearest
   Defense Courier Station and notify the local US military commander or US government
   activity.
   6.30.4. Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of
   such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. Shipments will be
   manifested separately and the manifest annotated with the words LIFE OR DEATH
   URGENCY. All shipments will be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the
   air cargo manifest or the DD Form 1907, Signature and Tally Record, for unit moves. The
   PIC, or designated representative, will be briefed on the urgency of the shipment and be
   made the custodian during flight.

Section 6D—Departure

6.31. On Time Takeoffs. A delay is charged any time the DV and passengers are ready to
move at the scheduled departure time and the aircraft is not ready for departure or cannot depart
due to maintenance or operational reasons.
   6.31.1. The simplest definition of a VIP delay is a failure to block out when the DV is ready
   at the scheduled time due to maintenance or operational reasons, thus delaying the DV. To
   promote the credibility of our reliability rate the following will be considered delays:
       6.31.1.1. A delay is credited when the mission blocked out "on-time" but could not
       takeoff due to maintenance or operational reasons, thus delaying the DV.
       6.31.1.2. A delay is credited when the mission blocked out "early" but could not takeoff
       due to maintenance or operational reasons, thus delaying the DV. The DV party should
       expect departure any time after stations time (30 minutes prior to scheduled takeoff time),
       or any time the crew has agreed (explicitly, or by loading the party, closing the door and
       implying readiness for departure) to depart early. If the party arrives prior to stations
       time and the crew is not ready a delay will not be charged. When the crew indicates they
       are ready (i.e. boarding party, closing door, removing stairs, starting engines, etc.),
       further delay would constitute a VIP delay.
       6.31.1.3. A delay is credited when the mission blocked out and took off "on-time" but air
       aborted or diverted to an airport other than the next scheduled stop due to maintenance or
       operational reasons, thus delaying the DV.
   6.31.2. Right side engine may be started prior to final on-load of all passengers provided
   baggage door is closed and locked in order to expedite overall engine start process. The PIC
 74                                                          AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


   will ensure the right side of the aircraft is safe and clear. The left side engine will not be
   started until all passengers, baggage and gear are on board, the baggage door is closed,
   locked and the area around the aircraft is safe and clear.
6.32. Cabin Security Procedures for Takeoff and Landing. The following procedures should
be followed prior to all takeoffs and landings:
   6.32.1. The PNF should assure all carry-on luggage, equipment and supplies are secured as
   soon as possible after boarding passengers. Ensure all passenger carry-on baggage is stowed
   to prevent a hazard during unforeseen events on takeoff or landing (i.e. aborted takeoff,
   emergency landing, low-level wind shear, turbulence, etc.) all seats are in the upright
   position and tray tables are stowed.

Section 6E—En route

6.33. Flight Progress.
   6.33.1. Prior to coast out fix, plot the oceanic portion of the flight on an appropriate Oceanic
   Plotting Chart (OPC). Annotate the chart with the mission number, PIC's name, preparer‘s
   name, and date. If practical, chart may be reused.
   6.33.2. Anytime waypoint data is inserted into the FMC/FMS, it will be verified by two
   primary crewmembers. Check both the coordinate information and the distances between
   waypoints against the flight plan.
   6.33.3. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor FMC/FMS performance.
   Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability which degrades
   centerline accuracy to the controlling ARTCC. Use the following procedures for flight
   progress:
       6.33.3.1. Obtain a coast out fix prior to, or immediately on entering the CAT I Route or
       overwater EROPS segment. Perform a gross navigation error check/altimetry check
       using available NAVAIDs and annotate the position, altitude and time on the chart.
       6.33.3.2. When approaching each waypoint, recheck coordinates for the next waypoint.
       Approximately 10 minutes after passing each oceanic waypoint, record and plot the
       aircraft position and time on the chart, and ensure compliance with courses and ETA
       tolerances.
       6.33.3.3. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the
       chart. For CPDLC operations, maintain a log of ATC clearances and retain with the
       OPC.
       6.33.3.4. Monitor FMC/FMS loaded EROPS ETP alternates for weather/NOTAMs.
       Contact dispatch or weather for updates if necessary.
   6.33.4. Post Mission Papers. Upon return to home station, turn in the charts (copies if
   reused) and applicable computer flight plans to the squadron stan/eval function. Squadron
   stan/eval will retain the charts, CFPs, CPDLC clearance logs, and associated materials for a
   minimum of 3 months.
   6.33.5. Operations in International/National Territorial Airspace (See FLIP, FCG, AP, and
   MDS series instruction for further guidance). US military aircraft and DoD personnel
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                     75


  entering another nation to conduct US government business therein must have the approval
  of the foreign government concerned to enter their airspace. Foreign clearances for US
  international air operations are obtained through the DAO. Refer to FLIP GP for discussion
  of international strait passage, archipelagic sea lane passage, procedures to follow if
  intercepted, and other international foreign sovereignty issues.
     6.33.5.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and national
     territorial airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states'
     territorial seas. Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by
     the coastal state. National Territorial airspace, also referred to as territorial or sovereign
     airspace, includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters, inland waters, and
     land territory and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be conducted in such areas only
     with the consent of the sovereign country.
     6.33.5.2. IAW international law, the US recognizes territorial sea claims and the
     corresponding airspace up to 12 nautical miles measured from baselines drawn consistent
     with international law (normally the low-water mark). Diplomatic constraints and/or a
     lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions operating in international
     airspace. Because of this, it is imperative sufficient information be provided far enough
     in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established by the countries
     concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims beyond 12 nautical
     miles; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish limits, which
     differ from the standard.
     6.33.5.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). An FIR is defined as an area of airspace
     within which flight information and related services are provided. An FIR does not
     reflect international borders or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an
     established FIR without approval of the adjacent controlling coastal state/country,
     provided the PIC avoids flight in sovereign airspace.
     6.33.5.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace
     into national territorial airspace for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained,
     should not amend entry point(s).
     6.33.5.5. Safe Passage violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or
     improper entry or departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace
     (12 NM seaward from sovereign landmass) for which a clearance has not been duly
     requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
     6.33.5.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
     penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
     country. Aircraft diplomatic clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
     6.33.5.7. In the event air traffic control agencies challenge the validity of a flight routing
     or attempt to negate existing clearances, pilots must evaluate the circumstances. The
     normal response will be to attempt to advise the air traffic control agency that the aircraft
     will continue to planned destination as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase
     is "in international airspace." Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission
     continuation. Under no circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance which routes
     their mission over sovereign airspace which was not approved through diplomatic
 76                                                          AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


       channels prior to mission departure, as being valid authorization. If faced with this
       situation, aircrews must contact the appropriate MAJCOM C2, as soon as possible, to
       obtain the correct approvals.
       6.33.5.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing
       will normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility
       transited prior to performing the critical portion of the mission.
       6.33.5.9. Aircrews normally are not tasked to and should not fly "due regard" routings
       unless coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM C2 with mission execution authority
       and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or "operational" option
       obligates the military PIC to be their own ATC agency to separate their aircraft from all
       other air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, PICs may exercise the "due regard"
       option to protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air traffic services as soon
       as practical.
   6.33.6. SPINS. Prior to transiting AOR airspace, review specific theater guidance, including
   SPINS. At a minimum, review the AOR communication plan, special airspace, and airfield
   ingress and egress procedures. Ensure FMC/FMS waypoints for tactical reporting points,
   approaches, and departures are loaded. If appropriate, review combat entry and exit
   checklists with crew members and designate a time/point to initiate or complete the
   checklists.
6.34. Navigational Aid Capability. Refer to chapter 11 of this AFI.
6.35. Communications Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings (CIRVIS)
and Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in FLIP
planning or FLIP En route Supplement.
   6.35.1. In-Flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
   air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
   and the type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest C2 center. Also
   attempt to contact the nearest CP when in UHF and VHF range.
   6.35.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting.
6.36. Communications.
   6.36.1. HF Communications. Confine message traffic to essential operational matters.
   Perform an HF radio ground check prior to takeoff when the use of HF radio may be required
   for ATC or C2 communications. Establish HF contact before going out of UHF and VHF
   range. If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling HF station and an alternate
   means of relay of ATC information in oceanic areas is not available, return to the nearest
   suitable support base.
   6.36.2. General. Provide ARTCC position and weather observations when required. If
   unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.
   Frequencies for GLOBAL HF stations are listed in the FIH.
   6.36.3. AF Form 72, Air Report (AIREP). When directed by departing weather facility, take
   and record an AIREP at each position report over a CAT I Route. Identify inaccurate CFP
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   77


   winds by special report if the average wind for a route segment exceeds either 30 degrees
   error in wind direction or 25 knots in wind speed. Turn in completed AF Form 72 to the
   destination USAF weather facility.
   6.36.4. SELCAL code assignments:
      6.36.4.1. Tail number 94-1569: BH-AM.
      6.36.4.2. Tail number 94-1570: EF-KL.
   6.36.5. ATO and SPINS. Prior to transiting an AOR with SPINS and ATO requirements,
   load assigned IFF modes/codes. Additionally, contact and monitor appropriate C2 agencies
   at designated times and points along route of flight.
6.37. In-Flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC shall report deviations from directives that
may occur as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions
permitting, inform passengers of the situation and intentions.
   6.37.1. Notification of Controlling Agencies. When practical after completing the aircraft
   emergency action checklists and associated actions, crews should furnish the controlling
   agency and appropriate C2 center a description of the difficulty, assistance required,
   intentions, and any other pertinent information.
   6.37.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL/SKYHOOK when additional
   expertise is necessary. Communications procedures are as follow:
      6.37.2.1. Local Area. When in UHF or VHF range, initiate the conference over
      appropriate frequencies.
      6.37.2.2. En route. Attempt to establish a phone patch with the nearest or controlling C2
      center using GLOBAL HF network, UHF/VHF stations, SATCOM, etc. If unable,
      aircrews are permitted to use ARINC radio service as an additional avenue for phone
      patch connectivity (ref paragraph 6.37.2.4. of this AFI).
      6.37.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits.
          6.37.2.3.1. Narrative description of the situation to include actions taken by the crew
          and the intentions of the PIC.
          6.37.2.3.2. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.
          6.37.2.3.3. Position.
          6.37.2.3.4. Altitude and flight conditions.
          6.37.2.3.5. Number of personnel and DVs on board.
          6.37.2.3.6. Qualification of PIC.
          6.37.2.3.7. Planned landing base.
          6.37.2.3.8. ETA at landing base.
      6.37.2.4. ARINC phone patch. If unable to contact a station with phone patch capability,
      the USAF has a contract with ARINC to provide this capability. ARINC has VHF
      coverage over the CONUS and Caribbean regions and HF coverage over most of the
      Atlantic and Pacific regions. Contact procedures can be found in the IFM Aircrew
 78                                                           AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


       Flimsy available on the TACC web site. It is recommended that this flimsy be placed in
       each mission kit. Additionally, ARINC is the oceanic position reporting service provider,
       and the position reporting frequencies found on enroute charts can be used to obtain
       phone patch frequencies from the radio operator.
6.38. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. Notification will include the patient‘s sex, approximate age, and major
complaint.
6.39. Weather Forecasts.
   6.39.1. PIC is responsible for obtaining destination weather prior to descent. The primary
   sources are TACC Global Mobility Weather Operations, Operational Weather Squadrons
   (OWS), USAF weather flights via pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV), MAJCOM
   approved CDS or FAA Flight Service Stations (FSS). Refer to the FIH for an OWS listing
   and their applicable AORs. The ATC system can provide weather information to en route
   aircraft.
6.40. Not Used.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Prior to descent into unfamiliar areas, appropriate terrain charts [Operational
Navigation Chart (ONC), Sectional Aeronautical Chart, Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC), or Joint
Operations Graphic (JOG)] should be reviewed to increase aircrew situational awareness of
obstructions. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other than aircraft operations,
descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the initial descent point to
landing.
   6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach.
       6.41.1.1. During night VMC conditions, if an approved instrument approach is not
       available, a visual approach may be flown as long as crews review appropriate VFR
       terrain charts and the intended runway has outlined runway lighting and is clearly
       discernible IAW AFI 11-202V3 paragraph 5.12. However, VIP crews should back up the
       visual approach with visual glide slope indicator (VASI, PAPI etc.). Use of FMC/FMS
       solution [Lateral Navigation (LNAV)/VNAV] and/or Enhanced Vision System (EVS) is
       authorized in lieu of visual glide slope lighting.
       6.41.1.2. On training and evaluation flights at familiar fields, pilots may perform VFR
       traffic patterns without (VASI, PAPI etc.). See local supplement for listing of familiar
       fields and local restrictions.
       6.41.1.3. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision
       approach, if weather minimums permit.
   6.41.2. Tactical Considerations. Prior to descending through a known or suspected WEZ,
   the PIC should review applicable AFTTP options with the crew. In addition, the PIC must
   comply with published AOR SPINS and airfield tactical arrival procedures.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   79


6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures. DoD/National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
(NGA), NACO or MAJCOM approved FLIP procedure can be flown by USAF aircrews without
requiring a TERPS review. Any non-DoD (Jeppesen, Host Nation) approach requires a TERPS
review that can be requested through the appropriate MAJCOM TERPS office. EXCEPTION:
Aircrew using the host government-sanctioned FLIP product for airfields located in a Special
Accredited Host Nation do not require TERPS reviews.
   6.42.1. Weather. Prior to starting an instrument approach or beginning an en route descent,
   pilots will confirm that existing weather is reported to be at or above required minimums for
   the lowest compatible approach. Pilots shall increase the published visibility minimums of
   an instrument approach by ½ SM or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach
   plate, when the runway approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. NOTE: This
   applies only to the ALS itself, not to VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component
   of the ALS.
   6.42.2. Precision Approach Minima. The ILS or Precision Approach Radar (PAR) decision
   height will provide a height above touchdown of 200 ft or higher. For CAT II ILS
   approaches, use the lowest published radar altitude. For PAR approaches, visibility will be
   no lower than RVR 2400 (730 meters) or 1/2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR
   readout available.
   6.42.3. Circling approach minimums will be as published for the applicable aircraft
   category. If not published by category, limit circling minimums to an MDA based on a HAA
   and visibility as indicated below or as published, whichever is higher.
       6.42.3.1. Category C: 500 feet HAA, 1 1/2-half mile visibility.
       6.42.3.2. Categories D and E: 600 feet HAA and 2-mile visibility.
   6.42.4. NDB approaches. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or IMC after
   compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS and the ASRR (note: some airfields will
   continue to be restricted IAW ASRR criteria for mountainous terrain, landing illusions, etc.).
   Back up each approach with available NAVAIDs/area navigation (RNAV)/GPS to include
   loading the NDB coordinates in the FMC/FMS (if equipped).
   6.42.5. RNAV, GPS and RNAV(GPS) Instrument Departures, Arrival and Approaches. All
   VIP aircrews are authorized to fly pure GPS, RNAV, and RNAV(GPS) instrument
   departures, arrivals, day or night, IMC or VMC. Comply with procedures and temperature
   corrections IAW AFI 11-202V3 and FIH. Aircraft must have RNP as published on the IAP.
   The PM shall monitor lateral cross track, vertical velocity trends, IAW AFM guidance and
   report alerts [required navigation performance (RNP), RAIM or loss of GPS signal] to the
   PF. PF shall execute missed approach if excessive deviations occur.
       6.42.5.1. Equipment. Aircraft must have operable RNAV (INS/IRS) and/or GPS-
       updated FMC/FMS equipment to ensure sufficient RAIM, or appropriate level of actual
       navigation performance (ANP) is available IAW AFM procedures prior to initiating the
       approach. IAP notes such as ―DME/DME RNP 0.3 N/A‖ or ―GPS Required‖ state that
       GPS signal and aircraft equipment must be operational to start the approach. For aircraft
       where the MEL/MMEL does not allow the approach, or if the required approach
       RAIM/ANP is not available, the approach shall not be flown.
80                                                        AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


     6.42.5.2. RNAV Instrument Approaches. All VIP Aircraft and certified aircrews are
     approved to perform RNAV approaches IAW AFI 11-202V3 and AFM guidance.
         6.42.5.2.1. LNAV approaches. LNAV approaches are non-precision approaches and
         may be flown IMC to a barometric LNAV MDA(H). They may be also be flown
         using VNAV procedures to a derived decision altitude (DDA) = LNAV MDA(H)
         +50ft. The PM shall monitor lateral track error IAW AFM guidance and provide
         trends to the PF.
         6.42.5.2.2. VNAV approaches. VNAV procedures differ from LNAV procedures as
         they are similar to ILS procedures following vertical path guidance. VNAV
         approaches may be flown IMC to a VNAV DA(H). IAW AFM guidance, C-38
         aircraft are authorized descent to published barometric VNAV DA (corrected for
         temp) in World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84) compliant airspace only. Use of
         remote altimeter settings to VNAV DA(H) minimums is prohibited. The PM shall
         monitor lateral/vertical track error IAW AFM guidance and provide trends for PF.
         6.42.5.2.3. RNAV (RNP) approaches. Aircrews are not authorized to fly RNAV
         (RNP) approaches until aircraft equipment is certified, aircrews are trained, and
         NGB/A3 has issued operational approval. This does not affect the capability to fly
         RNAV, RNAV (GPS), GPS, or ―OR GPS‖ approaches.
     6.42.5.3. Overlay approaches. The GPS Approach Overlay Program is an authorization
     for pilots to use GPS avionics under IFR for flying designated nonprecision instrument
     approach procedures, except LOC, LDA, and simplified directional facility (SDF)
     procedures. These procedures are now identified by the name of the procedure and ―or
     GPS‖ (e.g., VOR/DME or GPS RWY 15). Other previous types of overlays have either
     been converted to this format or replaced with stand-alone procedures. Only approaches
     contained in the current onboard navigation database are authorized.
     6.42.5.4. WGS-84 compliance. Individual country compliance with the WGS-84 means
     that the country‘s NAVAID and obstacle database conforms to the same US grid standard
     that today‘s updated avionics use to determine position. US NAS/Canadian Domestic
     Airspace is WGS-84 compliant. WGS-84 compliance is one of several items which are
     monitored to determine if a country‘s published RNAV(GPS) and overlay terminal
     procedures are authorized for use by USAF aircrews.               PICs shall check
     www.jeppesen.com to determine compliance if a country‘s WGS-84 status is in doubt.
     On the Jeppesen home page, type ―WGS-84 Status Report‖ in the search field to access
     the compliance list. Except as noted below, only those procedures that are WGS-84
     compliant may be flown using FMC/FMS guidance.
  6.42.6. Not Used.
  6.42.7. Not Used.
  6.42.8. Weather below minimums: Pilots will not execute an approach if advised prior to
  starting the en route descent or penetration that the airfield is below landing minimums.
     6.42.8.1. If a pilot starts the published approach, (an en route descent to an approach may
     be considered a published approach), and subsequently determines the weather is below
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                     81


       minimums, the pilot must not deviate from the last ATC clearance until obtaining a new
       or amended clearance. The pilot may elect to:
       6.42.8.2. Request clearance to a holding fix or alternate, as applicable.
       6.42.8.3. Continue the approach as published to the missed approach point and land, if
       the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing and the runway environment is in sight.
          6.42.8.3.1. Established on a Segment of the Approach. If established on a segment
          of the approach or being radar vectored to final approach and the weather is reported
          or observed to be below approach minimums, the PIC has the option of continuing
          the approach to the MAP/DA/DH. If deciding to abandon the approach, level off (or
          descend if a lower altitude is required for the missed approach procedure). Comply
          with the last assigned clearance until a new or amended clearance is received.
          6.42.8.3.2. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the aircraft is in a
          position to make a safe landing and the runway environment is in sight.
          6.42.8.3.3. If the approach is continued, PICs will ensure sufficient fuel is available
          to complete the approach and missed approach and proceed to a suitable alternate
          with normal fuel reserves.
          6.42.8.3.4. CAT II approaches will not be continued if weather is reported below
          CAT II minimums.
          6.42.8.3.5. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is
          below designated minimums and for initiating proper clearance requests.
   6.42.9. CAT II Procedures. Special aircraft and aircrew training required. Refer to AFI 11-
   217V1, Chapter 19 and appropriate AFM for CAT II ILS information.
       6.42.9.1. CAT II minimum RVR of 1200 ft (350 meters).
       6.42.9.2. CAT II minimums based on a HAT no lower than 100 ft.
       6.42.9.3. CAT II approaches without radio altimeter (RA) setting for DH are authorized.
       In this case IAP statement ―RA NA‖ denotes irregular terrain changes that affect RA.
       Utilize barometric DH and inner marker if approved on the IAP. If inner marker is
       inoperative, CAT II approaches are not authorized.
       6.42.9.4. CAT I ILS procedures will be used when unable to use alternate AFM guidance
       for local barometric DA(H) procedures.
       6.42.9.5. Not Used.
       6.42.9.6. Not Used.
       6.42.9.7. Use Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS) lighting (if
       available) at destination and taxi route.
6.43. Tactical Arrivals. If ingressing a WEZ and/or an airfield with known or suspected
threats, review applicable AFTTPs and published airfield tactical arrival procedures with the
crew.
 82                                                          AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


6.44. Unscheduled Landings. Notify the airfield selected for an emergency diversion as soon
as possible to allow maximum time to prepare the required assistance or services. ARTCC and
C2 centers will assist the PIC as necessary in notifying the appropriate agencies.
   6.44.1. Over-Flying Scheduled Refueling Stops. Before offering to over fly scheduled
   refueling stops, the PIC must consider all consequences that may arise. As a minimum,
   coordination with the contact, final arrival airport, over flight windows and greeting parties
   must be considered. Optimally the option of over-flying refueling stops should be
   coordinated with the contact and C2 through appropriate channels prior to departing home
   station.
6.45. Maintenance Debrief. Complete the AFTO 781, ARMS Flight and Mission Data Report,
after each flight. After landing, crewmembers debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of
the aircraft, engines, avionics equipment, and all installed special equipment as required.
Crewmembers are also responsible for documenting cosmetic faults on the aircraft to ensure
maintenance is aware of the flaw. See local maintenance debrief policies in local supplement of
this AFI.
6.46. Customs and Border Clearance.
   6.46.1. Normal Operations:
       6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
       clearance of all aircraft.
       6.46.1.2. When staff support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the
       PIC. Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to other designated crewmembers,
       but the PIC retains ultimate responsibility. The PIC is responsible for ensuring the
       following:
          6.46.1.2.1. Crew members and passengers possess current passports and valid visas,
          when required.
          6.46.1.2.2. Crew members and passengers have current record of immunization.
          6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
          6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the US through an airport where border clearance
          can be obtained.
          6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
          baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
          area.
          6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (FCG and paragraph 6.47. of this AFI).
   6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry:
       6.46.2.1. En route the designated crewmember will distribute personal customs
       declarations to all passengers and crew members. The designated crewmember will also
       brief passengers and crew members on customs regulations, and prepare and compile
       necessary border clearance forms for the PIC‘s signature.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                      83


     6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency or airfield contact at the base of intended
     landing of any change in ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as
     possible after landing.
     6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft
     (which has landed in the United States for customs clearance) proceed to another location
     in the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
     cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the off-load station and saves intermediate
     off-loading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to
     proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be
     completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make
     intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of
     manifested cargo unless required by an emergency situation or directed by the controlling
     C2 center.
     6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
     normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
     passengers or crew members unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life and
     property. Do not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their
     designated representatives. This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all
     landings required when operating on a permit to proceed or until all crew, passengers,
     and cargo complete final border clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of US aircraft by foreign officials:
     6.46.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG, chapter
     6, section G. In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are immune from
     searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections) by foreign
     officials. In addition, PICs must be aware of and adhere to any specific FCG provisions
     for individual countries.
     6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
     the following procedures:
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities who may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters or the
         appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then notify these agencies of the
         foreign request by the most expeditious means available and follow their instructions.
         6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
         notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
         indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
         time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
         so.
 84                                                          AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


          6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
          way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action
          being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
          appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
          physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
          and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
          authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
       6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
       Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG.
6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PIC will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to AFJI
   48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, FCG, or as directed by higher
   headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form (CF) 7507, or on forms provided by the
   country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on-board. The only
   exception is when the FCG mandates it.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.
       Use the following guidelines:
          6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
          sprayed.
          6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
          loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
          wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
          6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
          aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
          ventilation openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation
          after use, spray prior to boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for
          10 minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on
          board.
       6.47.1.2. Spraying Times. Spray the aircraft for the following times unless longer
       periods are specified for the country being transited:

Table 6.2. Spray Times.
                          MDS Aircraft              Spraying Time
                               C-38                      15 Sec

   6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, base operations, or airport manager of the
   situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation or to deplane the minimum number of crewmembers required for
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                     85


   block-in duties. Do not on-load or off-load cargo or passengers until the inspection is
   satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.48. Dropped Object Response. If a dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
   6.48.1. Notify the Mission Operations or SOC and the controlling agency as soon as
   practical; includes routing, altitude, weather, etc.
   6.48.2. Notify unit safety and maintenance at the next station transited.
6.49. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR). If involved in a
mishap or incident, after landing and terminating the emergency, open the CVR and FDR power
circuit breakers.
   6.49.1. FDR and CVR systems, if installed, should be operative prior to departure and
   operated continuously from the start of the takeoff roll until the aircraft has completed
   landing roll at destination. If en route failure occurs, continue the mission to a station where
   adequate repairs can be made. If involved in a mishap or incident, open the CVR and FDR
   power circuit breaker after landing and after terminating the emergency. CVR recordings are
   considered factual and the transcript is not a privileged document. The actual aircrew voices
   on the tape should be considered protected under the Privacy Act. See AFI 91-204, Safety
   Investigations and Reports.
6.50. Aircrew Flight Equipment and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The PIC or
designated representative will:
   6.50.1. Prior to departing home station or en route stations, ensure appropriate serviceable
   protective clothing, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE), survival, and dash 21 equipment for
   the entire or remainder of the mission are aboard the aircraft. Review applicable leased
   aircraft procedures.
   6.50.2. Prior to departing home station and following en route crew changes, review AF
   Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required dash 21 equipment
   has been certified as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed by
   maintenance, and configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.50.3. Prior to departing home station and following en route crew changes, review, sign,
   and date the AFTO 46, Pre-positioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure all required
   protective clothing aircrew flight and survival equipment have been certified as installed by
   AFE technicians, and that configuration documents match mission requirements. Ensure
   appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for over-water missions carrying
   children and infants.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment.        Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will
   accomplish the following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO 781 entry for equipment found missing. Additionally, ensure
       equipment removed from the aircraft at an en route station is documented in the AFTO
       781.
 86                                                         AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF 4076 and AFTO 46 in the next vacant column, by indicating the
       quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above
       the check number of that column.
       6.50.4.3. Leave AF 4076 and AFTO 46 on board the aircraft in the event of an en route
       crew change.
       6.50.4.4. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
       recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.5. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.6. When possible, advise MAJCOM Stan/Eval (or airport management) before
       mission continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
   annotated on the AF 4076 and AFTO 46, annotate the total quantity in the next vacant
   column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
   number of that column.
6.51. Passenger Restrictions. The only passengers on missions transporting DVs will be those
of the official party and those space available passengers authorized by the on-board contact
officer.
   6.51.1. Space Available Passengers. For other than revenue and White House missions,
   PICs are authorized to release space available seats on mission legs when no official
   passengers are aboard (positioning and de-positioning legs). PICs are encouraged to release
   maximum space available seats subject to the following restrictions:
       6.51.1.1. Revenue Missions. These are missions for which the using agency (typically a
       government agency other than DoD) is reimbursing DoD for use of the aircraft. Space
       available passengers on revenue missions must be approved in advance by
       USAF/CVAM/AMD/JOSAC (as appropriate) and the using agency contact officer
       through unit C2 agencies. This is essential to ensure proper funding and reimbursement.
       Consult CVAM/AMD/JOSAC to determine mission revenue status if in doubt.
       Congressional Delegations (CODEL) are not revenue missions.
       6.51.1.2. White House Support Missions. Space available passengers will generally not
       be permitted aboard White House support mission aircraft without express permission of
       HQ USAF/CVAM. This is normally due to the security status of the aircraft, which may
       include positioning and de-positioning legs. When it is necessary to move aircrew
       members or support personnel on White House support mission aircraft, the WHMO will
       be advised and permission obtained through the unit C2 and CVAM. On de-positioning
       legs space available passengers will usually be permitted if the aircraft is no longer
       required to maintain an upgraded security status.
       6.51.1.3. Billing. Space available passengers on revenue missions may be subject to
       being billed commercial first-class airfare by the using agency for the applicable route,
       depending on that agency's policy. If the DV or on-board contact officer releases seats,
       aircraft commander must ensure that any additional financial liability for the passengers
       is specified by the using agency on-board contact officer. PIC will ensure passengers
       understand and agree to any reimbursement conditions prior to boarding.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                    87


       6.51.1.4. Anti-hijacking Inspections. Board space available passengers only after anti-
       hijacking inspections are completed. If a space available seat release is anticipated at an
       en route station, the local passenger service facility will be advised of the inspection
       requirement. Procedures for anti-hijacking inspections by the aircrew at stations without
       a military passenger service facility are specified in chapter 13. The PIC has final
       authority for accepting space available passengers.
   6.51.2. Passenger Boarding. On all missions operating without security guards or a FA, the
   PIC or his/her designate will ensure that all passengers are listed on the passenger manifest
   prior to boarding the aircraft. Passengers will be greeted and checked at the bottom of the
   steps. The PIC or the mission escort officer must clear any passengers not listed on the
   manifest prior to entering the aircraft. This task will be completed at the beginning of each
   mission and any time passengers have to re-board the aircraft.
6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting strange airfields or airfields where conditions
may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
   slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
   contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, etc.
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.
6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight or ground
incident, the PIC should impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the
controlling C2 center and parent MAJCOM safety office for further instructions.
6.54. No Show Passenger Baggage. Unclaimed passenger baggage and untagged baggage will
be subject to search and seizure. Under no circumstances will it be allowed on the aircraft.
Tagged but no-show passenger baggage or baggage of passengers removed from flight will be
downloaded prior to departure. Aircrew will not accept unaccompanied baggage except IAW
AMCI 24-101.
6.55. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP GP section 6 for more
information concerning wake turbulence separation.
6.56. Operations at Airports Above 10,000’ MSL. Use approved AFM procedures and the
following aircrew procedures for operations at airports above 10,000‘ MSL:
   6.56.1. Raise cabin altitude to 10,000 feet during the descent. Configure aircraft
   pressurization, air conditioning, and oxygen/warning systems as required and complete the
   remaining depressurization on final approach.
   6.56.2. A specific timed period of oxygen use prior to landing is not required. Aircrew
   members use oxygen during descent, approach, landing, takeoff, and ground operations when
   engines are running/checklist operations in progress.
   6.56.3. PIC briefing and passenger briefings must include cautions on high altitude
   operations and hypoxia. All passengers are susceptible to hypoxia during depressurized
   flight above 10,000 feet cabin altitude. Take your time during ground operations at high
 88                                                          AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


   altitude. Monitor and back up other crewmembers servicing or loading the aircraft. Keep
   portable oxygen bottles readily available in the event of over-exertion or hypoxia.
   Administer oxygen to any passenger displaying hypoxia symptoms.
   6.56.4. Emergency Egress Restrictions.         CAUTION:        Do not, repeat, do not land
   pressurized.
6.57. Classified Equipment and Material.
   6.57.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure aircraft security
   requirements are met according to chapter 7 of this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of
   the USAF, ensure the aircraft and equipment are protected. AFI 31-401, Information
   Security Program Management, provides specific guidance concerning the security of
   various levels of classified equipment aboard aircraft.
   6.57.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will
   provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during en route,
   turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is not available, the aircraft gun storage
   box or classified safe may be used for material classified up to and including SECRET.
   Encrypted COMSEC will only be transferred to authorized DoD personnel.
   6.57.3. IFF/Selective Identification Feature (SIF). Ground check IFF/SIF prior to takeoff
   (ground test assets permitting). IFF self-test or radar interrogation will satisfy this
   requirement. This check is not required on stopover flights if the IFF is operational upon
   landing unless required by theater directives.
   6.57.4. Mode 4. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode 4 when required for
   mission accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode 4
   (ground test assets permitting) prior to deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD
   or contingency/exercise tasking.
      6.57.4.1. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode 4 prior to takeoff. Do not delay takeoff or
      cancel a mission for an inoperable Mode 4, except when the aircraft will transit an area
      where safe passage procedures are implemented.
      6.57.4.2. Conduct a ground or inflight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the
      CONUS for overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check
      through NORAD on UHF frequency 364.2. Ground and inflight checks of the Mode 4,
      when conducted, are mandatory maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate
      successful and unsuccessful interrogation of the Mode 4 on all aircraft forms (AFTO
      781A).
      6.57.4.3. Aircraft with inoperable Mode 4 will continue to their intended destinations.
      Repairs will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and
      maintenance technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented,
      aircraft will follow procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable
      airspace control order or ATO.
      6.57.4.4. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate
      the Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Prior to departing
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                            89


     for any destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local
     COMSEC managers for guidance.
     6.57.4.5. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate
     the Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Prior to departing
     for any destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local
     COMSEC managers for guidance.

                                          Chapter 7

                                  AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. Your mission places you and your aircraft in an environment highly vulnerable to
security threats. The importance of the DVs transported and the high frequency of missions into
civil airports throughout the world magnify this vulnerability. Positive security measures are
required at all times. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and
resisting aircraft piracy (hijacking) of VIP Aircraft. AFI 13-207, AFI 31-101, The Air Force
Installation Security Program (FOUO), and specific MAJCOM security publications contain
additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information concerning hijacking attempts or
identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. The OG/CC or above may direct the use of security personnel above and beyond
the requirements of AFI 31-101. The waiver approval authority for VIP RAVEN team
composition, security and RAVEN team support requirements is the WG/CC exercising
authority over VIP Aircraft.
   7.2.1. Protection Level (PL)-1. Presidential WHMO, Office of the Secretary of Defense
   (OSD) designated aircraft are required continuous security protection at home station, en
   route operating locations and contract maintenance facilities. Depending on the mission, the
   C-38 may be designated a PL-1 resource. Refer to AFI 31-101 for PL-1 security
   requirements.
   7.2.2. PL-2/PL-3. The C-38A is normally designated as a PL-3 resource. Depending on the
   mission, the C-38A may be designated as a PL-2 resource. Refer to AFI 31-101 for PL-2/3
   security requirements.
7.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will
implement AFI 31-101 requirements for VIP Aircraft:
   7.3.1. PIC Authority. The PIC will ensure that adequate aircraft security measures are
   provided at all times.
   7.3.2. Advance Security Support Arrangements. The PIC will ensure security support has
   been coordinated at en route stations in advance. If security requirements cannot be met
   prior to departure, the airfield may be deemed unsuitable for RON by the unit. Units may
   use ORM teams and Mission Assessment Groups (MAG) to integrate MAJCOM and AOR
   Intel/Threat Working Group (TWG) recommendations to determine suitability. OG/CC or
   equivalent is arbiter for security. Home station CP and unit C2 will assist the PIC for alert
   missions or en route diversions.
   7.3.3. Briefings. When required, PICs will obtain threat assessment and security capability
   evaluation briefings before departing home station. Unit C2 will provide the PIC with
   pertinent updates en route.
   7.3.4. Baggage Security. Baggage not certified safe for loading by a responsible government
   agency will be inspected prior to loading at the PIC‘s discretion. Verify baggage
   identification against passenger manifest. Aircrew members will secure their own baggage.
   The PIC is responsible for explaining baggage security requirements to the mission contact.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   91


      7.3.4.1. On PL-1 and PL-2 aircraft, all passenger baggage will be inspected prior to
      loading. A RAVEN will verify baggage identification against the passenger manifest.
   7.3.5. Fuel Security.
      7.3.5.1. Fuel for PL-1 Presidential Aircraft must pass a laboratory analysis and be
      secured until used. The USAF advance agent will obtain and secure this fuel.
      7.3.5.2. Fuel for other aircraft do not require secured fuel. Use fuel obtained from large
      capacity, high use sources not pre-designated for VIP Aircraft.
   7.3.6. Flight Line Photography. There are no restrictions on exterior photography of VIP
   Aircraft. Interior photos of enroute VIP Aircraft are at the discretion of the PIC and the
   principle DV. Care must be taken to remove all classified materials from sight prior to
   authorizing any photography. Specific airfields may have restrictions regarding the
   photography of aircraft.
7.4. Not Used.
7.5. En Route Security.
   7.5.1. Aircraft Access Control. Positive control of access to VIP Aircraft is mandatory.
      7.5.1.1. When directed by the OG/CC, ASNCOs control access to VIP Aircraft. They
      will positively identify all individuals granted unescorted entry to the aircraft.
      7.5.1.2. When RAVENs do not accompany aircraft, the aircrew is responsible for
      controlling access. At USAF installations, a passenger service representative normally
      assists in boarding passengers. The passenger service representative should be at the
      aircraft prior to passenger arrival and remain at the aircraft until loading is complete.
      Monitor all servicing and support personnel. Do not allow unidentified personnel
      onboard or around the aircraft. Escort unofficial visitors on board the aircraft and keep
      them under surveillance until they depart.
   7.5.2. Use of Aircraft Sealing Devices. Except for Presidential, Presidential Support, and
   SDSAM aircraft protected by a RAVEN, VIP Aircraft should be sealed (at the discretion of
   the PIC) during all RONs and during any ground time when aircrew is absent from the
   aircraft. Seal doors and hatches according to local wing directives. Aircraft with an onboard
   ground security system meet the intent of this paragraph.
   7.5.3. Refer to chapter 15 of this AFI for specific RAVEN procedures.
   7.5.4. RAVEN policy. Typical teams will consist of a minimum of two USAF security force
   members depending on MDS and MAJCOM security requirements. The team travels as
   MEPs and are responsible to the PIC at all times. In turn, PICs are responsible for their
   welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.). PICs will ensure security team members receive a
   mission briefing and aircraft egress/passenger briefing (as appropriate).
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. Suspected Unauthorized Entry. If the PIC suspects the aircraft has been tampered
   with or subjected to unauthorized entry, take the following actions:
      7.6.1.1. Notify the local security authorities and request a thorough inspection of the
      aircraft for sabotage, explosive devices, and pilferage.
 92                                                           AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


      7.6.1.2. Notify CP and C2 centers. Advise them of any requirements for assistance, and
      give them your estimate of a revised departure time.
      7.6.1.3. If there are indications that sabotage is a definite possibility or if security
      inspections may delay the DV party, notify the mission contact officer. Establish suitable
      departure time and if necessary, coordinate suitable alternate transportation through
      current operations or SOC.
      7.6.1.4. Monitor the security check of the aircraft. When cleared by security authorities,
      conduct a thorough preflight inspection. Look for broken wiring, damaged components,
      foreign devices, etc.
      7.6.1.5. If both the security authorities and the PIC are assured aircraft is safe to fly,
      notify the OG/CC. Depart only with the OG/CC approval. Safety and aircraft security
      take priority over minimizing DV inconvenience.
   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   During preflight activities, aircrews will inspect all accessible areas, to include aircraft wheel
   wells, and cargo compartments for personnel or other unfamiliar devices. Report any
   suspicious items to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security
   posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.7.1. General Hijacking Guidance. A hijacking could create a serious international incident
   and jeopardize the safety of passengers and crew. High level DVs traveling aboard VIP
   Aircraft increase potential severity of any hijacking incident. Expect the National Military
   Command Center (NMCC) to become involved in resolving hijack crises. Military C2 is
   central POC if a hijacking threatens your VIP Aircraft or passengers at any location. The
   PIC is the coordinating authority for anti-hijacking procedures. The PIC has first-hand
   knowledge of the situation and must take every opportunity to keep command authorities
   apprised of the situation. Use military C2 channels to contact NMCC, who in turn will relay
   instructions to the PIC.
   7.7.2. The Air Transportation Act of 1974 and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
   amended, vest the FAA Administrator with exclusive responsibility for the direction of law
   enforcement activity in aircraft hijacking situations involving all aircraft (civil and military)
   in-flight in the United States.
   7.7.3. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.7.4. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that the DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, the
   DoD will provide the FAA, and where appropriate, the FBI, with all pertinent information.
   Where possible, the FAA will consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law
   enforcement activity.
   7.7.5. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                         93


   7.7.6. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.7.7. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation. Resistance may vary from dissuasion to
   direct confrontation, including the use of weapons. RAVENs are authorized to use weapons
   to subdue a hijacker.
   7.7.8. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.7.9. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.7.10. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
   7.7.11. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the PIC of the aircraft and the authority exercising OPCON of the anti-hijacking effort.
7.8. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When VIP Aircraft are operating
away from home station, the PIC will ensure provisions of this chapter and AFI 13-207, as
supplemented, are complied with.
   7.8.1. Preventive measures include the following:
       7.8.1.1. The host station passenger processing or manifesting facility should conduct
       anti-hijacking inspections.
       7.8.1.2. Do not board passengers until the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results.
       7.8.1.3. In the absence of qualified passenger service representatives, the PIC will ensure
       the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and baggage is accomplished.
   7.8.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
   7.8.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.8.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXCEPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, Personal Security Details and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
   7.8.5. If weapons must be cleared, ask the individual to:
       7.8.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
       personnel before unholstering or unslinging their weapons.
 94                                                           AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


       7.8.5.2. Clear weapons IAW standard safety procedures.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple discussion through deception and subterfuge, to direct
physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. To counter a hijacking, actual or threatened, delay movement of the aircraft to provide
   time for ground personnel and the aircrew to establish communication and execute
   coordinated resistance actions.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijackers in conversation to calm him or her and to evaluate what course
   of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
   7.10.6. Never give up control of the aircraft to a hijacker.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will notify ground agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up
with situation reports as circumstances permit. Detailed guidance is contained in AFI 13-207.
   7.11.1. Crews will transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. If an in-the-
   clear transmission is not possible, set transponder to 7500. If unable to set the transponder,
   or if not under radar control, transmit a radio message indicating transponder change to 7500.
   7.11.2. Aircrews will not use the covert signals depicted in AFI 13-207 Table 2, Covert
   Signals, to communicate the presence of a hijacking situation. Code words, covert
   notification actions, and further transponder changes will not be used.
7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. These procedures are designed to deter
possible hostile action against the hijacked aircraft that has been forced to penetrate airspace of a
nation unfriendly to the United States.
   7.12.1. If instructions from the unfriendly nation are received either by radio contact or by
   air intercept before boundary crossing, comply with instructions received.
   7.12.2. If no contact with unfriendly nation is made before approaching a boundary:
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                     95


       7.12.2.1. Maintain TAS not more than 400 knots.
       7.12.2.2. Maintain an altitude between 10,000 and 25,000 feet if possible.
       7.12.2.3. Fly a direct course toward destination announced by the hijacker, if no course is
       specified.
       7.12.2.4. Transmit the international distress signal, MAYDAY, on any of the
       international distress frequencies (121.5 MHz, 243.0 MHz, or 2182 KHz) in an effort to
       establish communications.
       7.12.2.5. Set Mode 3 code 7700 on transponder.
       7.12.2.6. If radio contact cannot be established, follow procedures set forth in FLIP.
   7.12.3. Consider the presence of classified documents and equipment aboard the aircraft.
   When a landing in an unfriendly nation is imminent, attempt to dispose of or destroy the
   equipment or material.
7.13. Arming of Crewmembers. Aircrews will be armed on all overseas missions unless
RAVENs are a part of the crew (not required for a CONUS depot input for OCONUS units).
Units will establish which crewmembers will be armed in their supplement to this AFI. All
crewmembers should know who is armed. Arm aircrews on CONUS missions only when
directed by the mission operations or SOC IAW OPORD or OPLAN. Unit commanders will
ensure that crewmembers are trained in weapon issue, loading, safety, firing, transfer, and receipt
procedures. Comply with AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel. If an
armed crewmember must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized
crewmember using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   7.13.1. Standby/Alert Launches. Do not delay the mission to pick-up weapons. If it appears
   there will be an unacceptable wait to get weapons, proceed to the aircraft and notify the CP.
   7.13.2. Crew Rest. When crew must RON, secure weapons in the aircraft gun box with
   approved lock. Do not use local armories.
   7.13.3. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crewmembers. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and from
   the C2 center, armories and other facilities associated with aircrew activities. When
   OCONUS, wearing weapons outside the aircraft is discouraged. Keep armed crewmembers
   inside the aircraft.
   7.13.4. Weapons Storage In-flight. Crewmembers will be armed before preflight, onload, or
   offload duties and until completion of all offload duties. When no passengers are onboard,
   weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a satisfactory stowaway check.
   Crewmembers will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be unloaded before placing
   them in a gun box.
   7.13.5. Crewmembers will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
   termination at home station.
   7.13.6. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another
   crewmember; place the weapon on a flat surface.
 96                                                           AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to the possibility of terrorist activities at all times.
Reference AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual; Joint Service Guide 5260, Service Member's
Personal Protection Guide: A Self-Help Handbook to Combating Terrorism; AFI 10-245,
Antiterrorism; and applicable AFTTPs for Force Protection measures. The following
considerations may help crewmembers avoid becoming victims of terrorism when operating
OCONUS:
   7.14.1. Personal Conduct. Crews must realize their conduct can make them a target for
   individuals dissatisfied with US foreign involvement in their national affairs. Local foreign
   nationals may or may not condone a military presence - crew conduct will be watched and
   judged. Therefore, utilize the following:
       7.14.1.1. Maintain good military bearing both on and off duty.
       7.14.1.2. Avoid dressing in clothes that highlight the fact you are an American, i.e.
       cowboy hats, wide belt buckles, shirts with pro-American slogans, etc.
       7.14.1.3. Do not wear clothing displaying profanity.
       7.14.1.4. Know where ―off limits‖ areas are and avoid them.
       7.14.1.5. When possible, travel in groups of two or more.
       7.14.1.6. Avoid demonstrations for any cause.
       7.14.1.7. Avoid discussion of politics.
       7.14.1.8. Avoid using ranks or titles in public places.
   7.14.2. Ground transportation security. When traveling to and from billeting, messing
   facilities, etc. consider the following to minimize drawing attention to yourself as a potential
   target:
       7.14.2.1. If possible, consider not using a car that announces government ownership.
       7.14.2.2. Park in well-lighted areas.
       7.14.2.3. Always lock your car. If possible, do not leave it on the street overnight.
       7.14.2.4. Avoid isolated roads and dark alleys.
   7.14.3. Personal Identification. Consider the following actions to avoid advertising the fact
   you are an American:
       7.14.3.1. Avoid military style luggage such as B-4 bags and duffel bags with military
       logos, etc. Luggage tags should be nondescript and not reflect the type of mission (e.g.
       no souvenir luggage tags from previous VIP Missions). All bags, including hand-carried
       bags, will have luggage tags.
       7.14.3.2. Consider placing your official passport and related documents such as military
       ID, flight orders, dog tags in your hand-carried luggage and not in your wallet or purse.
       7.14.3.3. Wear     conservative   styled   civilian   clothing   when   using commercial
       transportation.
   7.14.4. Hotel Security. When billeted in commercial hotels, crews need to be aware of the
   following:
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                     97


      7.14.4.1. If possible, obtain rooms between the second and sixth floors.
      7.14.4.2. Always lock interior locks when occupying rooms.
      7.14.4.3. Always assume your room is monitored and avoid viewing or discussing
      classified material.
      7.14.4.4. Sanitized crew lists with names only should be used to record room numbers.
      7.14.4.5. At no time should the crew orders be given to hotel registration clerks.
      7.14.4.6. Orders, itineraries, or other mission related materials should not be left in clear
      view in hotel rooms.
      7.14.4.7. Avoid home station addresses on hotel registrations and baggage tags.
7.15. Protecting Classified Material on Aircraft. The PIC is responsible for protection of
classified materials aboard their aircraft. See requirements in AFI 31-401. As a minimum,
ensure the IFF equipment is set to zero before leaving the aircraft.
 98                                                             AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012

Prevention Program.
   8.2.1. The Air Force hazard reporting system provides a means for Air Force personnel to
   alert supervisors and commanders to hazardous conditions requiring prompt corrective
   action.
   8.2.2. Special Procedures for Hazard Reports Concerning Weather. Complete the front of an
   AF Form 457 and address it to the parent wing flying safety office. If a computer flight plan
   deficiency is involved, attach one copy of the AF Form 72, Air Report (AIREP) or AF Form
   4053, INS Flight Plan and Log, and the CFP to the report. Send the report so that the parent
   wing flying safety office receives it within 5 days.
8.3. AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). The AF Form 651 is a tool to
report near midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. See Attachment 3 of
AFI 91-202 for more information concerning the HATR program.
   8.3.1. AFI 91-204, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, list
   HATR reportable incidents.
   8.3.2. The PIC shall report the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g. ARTCC,
   FSS, control tower, or aeronautical radio station) as quickly as safety allows. Include the
   following information in the radio call (as appropriate):
       8.3.2.1. Aircraft identification or call sign.
       8.3.2.2. Time and place (radial/DME of NAVAID, position relative to the airfield,

flight related documents, (e.g. flight plans, weather briefings, NOTAMs, Weight and Balance
form, etc.) for collection by appropriate safety officials.
   8.4.1. PICs will report crewmember or passenger injury, aircraft damage, or injury/damage
   to another organization‘s people or equipment caused by PIC‘s aircraft/crewmember. At a
   minimum, report the following:
      8.4.1.1. Any physiological episode (physiological reaction, near accident, or hazard in-
      flight due to medical or physiological reasons). NOTE: Crewmembers and passengers
      involved in a physiological episode will see a flight surgeon to be evaluated and to ensure
      the incident is reported in the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) as soon as
      practical.
      8.4.1.2. A human factor related situation, [e.g. misinterpretation of instruments;
      information overload (i.e. tactile, aural, and visual input too fast to permit reasonable
      analysis/decision); aircrew task saturation (i.e. too many responses/actions required in a
      short period of time); or confused switchology (i.e. adjacent switches where actuation of
      wrong switch creates dangerous situation)]. Anonymous reports are acceptable.
      8.4.1.3. A condition that required engine shutdown, in-flight flameout, engine failure,
      suspected engine power loss, or loss of thrust that required descent below MEA. Engine
      failures include, but are not limited to, shrapnel from a failed internal engine component
      penetrating the engine case, engine case rupture/burn-through, engine nacelle fire,
      substantial fuel leak, or unselected thrust reversal. Consistent with safety, immediately
      report incidents that involve multiple engines (may report single-engine incidents upon
      landing). NOTE: Exclude intentional shutdowns for training and/or FCF unless the
      engine fails to restart.
      8.4.1.4. A flight control malfunction (including the autopilot and trim systems) that
      results in an unexpected or hazardous change of flight attitude, altitude, or heading.

   days of the event/notification.
   8.5.5. Use OPREP-3 reporting procedures contained in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting,
   for navigation errors over 24 NMs.
       8.5.5.1. When notified of a navigation position error, the PIC (or agency that receives
       initial notification) shall document the circumstances surrounding the incident (using
       report format below) and ensure C2 agents submit an OPREP-3. Include the following
       information in the report:
          8.5.5.1.1. The name and location of agency/unit submitting report.
          8.5.5.1.2. Affected mission identification number.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                101


         8.5.5.1.3. Reference OPREPs-3 to determine type of event (i.e., state "navigation
         position error.").
         8.5.5.1.4. The date, time (Zulu), and location (e.g., ARTCC area) of alleged
         infraction.

  8.5.6. PICs shall expeditiously report unusual events/circumstances that impact their mission
  to appropriate MAJCOM agencies. Reportable events include, but are not limited to,
  spectrum interference, uncoordinated aircraft interception, fuel dumping, multiple engine
  failure, hostile fire, injury to passenger or aircrew member, hostile attacks on aircraft
  communications networks, etc. This list is not all exhaustive. Most events require C2 agents
  to forward OPREP reports to higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the ―who, what, when,
  where, why, and how‖ of the incident to a C2 agency.
     8.5.6.1. The Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, covered in AFI 10-707,
     Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, establishes procedures to combat the effect
     of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference. PICs who encounter EMI will report
     the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon as practical.
         8.5.6.1.1. Address EMI reports to: HQ AMC SCOTT AFB IL//A6O// and addressees
         listed in AFI 10-707. Send reports via electronic message format with the following
         information in plain text:
             8.5.6.1.1.1. Frequency selected when EMI occurred.
             8.5.6.1.1.2. Equipment affected by EMI. Location of the system. The system
             function, name, nomenclature, manufacturer with model number or other system
             description. The operating mode of the system, if applicable (frequency agile,
             pulse doppler, search, etc.).
             8.5.6.1.1.3. Description of EMI (noise, pulsed, continuous, intermittent, on so
             forth).
             8.5.6.1.1.4. Effect EMI had on system performance (reduced range, false targets,
             reduced intelligibility, data errors, etc.).
             8.5.6.1.1.5. Date(s) and time(s) of EMI.
             8.5.6.1.1.6. Location where EMI occurred (coordinates or line of bearing, if
             known, otherwise state as unknown).
             8.5.6.1.1.7. Source of the EMI if known.
             8.5.6.1.1.8. List other units that received interference (if known) and their
             location or distance and bearing from your location.
             8.5.6.1.1.9. A clear, concise narrative summary on what you know about the
             EMI, with any actions taken to resolve the problem.
             8.5.6.1.1.10. Whether or not PIC wants expert/technical assistance (include level
             of security clearance expert requires).
 102                                                        AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


              8.5.6.1.1.11. Specify impact the EMI had on your mission.
              8.5.6.1.1.12. Provide a POC (Name, Rank, DSN/Commercial Phone Number,
              and Duty hours).
          8.5.6.1.2. C2 agents must prepare an OPREP-3 if EMI is suspected meaconing,
          intrusion, or jamming, interference sufficient to cause a hazard, or if, in the PIC‘s
          judgment, the situation warrants such a report.
          8.5.6.1.3. PICs shall serve as classification authority for EMI reports. Evaluate an
          adversaries‘ ability to exploit certain systems using EMI and protect information
          accordingly. PICs on a non-sensitive mission or who judge the EMI to be
          interference from a non-hostile source need not classify EMI reports unless that report
          would reveal system vulnerability. Classify interference report(s) at stations located
          in combat areas or during sensitive military missions.
       8.5.6.2. On aircraft that dial into the GNOC, CSOs must report hostile attacks on aircraft
       networks to the GNOC, where protective measures will be implemented and reported.
       Hostile attacks may include penetration attempts, denial of service, viruses, or malicious
       code. This is not an all-inclusive list.
8.6. Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
invoice processing, and program supervision (reference DESC-I-31, Purchase of Aviation Fuel
and Services at Commercial Locations). Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC) AIR card for
the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and some
military installations) worldwide. The AIR card is authorized for use by all U.S. government
aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government aircraft. All
PICs should plan to use the ―platinum‖ MSC card. In most cases, there will be no changes when
refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The MSC card is
accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting merchants
can be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase
Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card. MSC can be contacted 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week regarding acceptance or refueling issues. Their toll free number is 1-866-
308-3811.
   8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of the MSC card
   could create financial liability for the purchaser.
   8.6.2. Refuel/defuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations whenever possible. If DoD service is
   not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:

                                     TRAINING POLICY

9.1. Passengers on Training Missions.
   9.1.1. Carrying of passengers during initial or re-qualification training will be IAW with AFI
   11-401 and this instruction.
   9.1.2. Mission qualification training, en route evaluations, OSTs, and line development
   missions may be conducted on missions with passengers provided the individual in training
   is qualified (completed aircraft evaluation with a valid AF Form 8).
   9.1.3. Multiple practice approaches will not be accomplished with passengers.
   EXCEPTION: When approved by the parent MAJCOM/A3, maintenance and civilian
   employees, under direct contract to the DoD and engaged in official direct mission support
   activities, considered mission essential may be onboard when touch-and-go landings are
   performed providing the mission is a designated training flight and an IP or EP is in
   command.
9.2. Touch and Go Landing Limitations. Practice touch-and-go landings only on designated
training, evaluation, and currency missions.
   9.2.1. Touch-and-go landings. May be performed by:
       9.2.1.1. Instructor pilots, instructor pilot candidates on initial or re-qualification
       instructor evaluations, and flight examiner pilots from either seat.
       9.2.1.2. Any pilot from either seat provided that an instructor pilot, instructor pilot
       candidate on initial or re-qualification instructor evaluation, or flight examiner pilot is in
       the other seat.
   9.2.2. Wind and runway restrictions. Comply with wind restrictions, RCR and crosswind
   limits, and runway requirements in chapter 5 of this AFI. Do not exceed the normal or
   recommended zone of AFM takeoff and landing crosswind component charts.
   9.2.3. Weather. The minimum reported weather required to perform touch-and-go landings
   is 300 foot ceiling and RVR 4000, 1200 meters (3/4-mile visibility without RVR). NOTE:
   RVR values published in a METAR or other meteorological source will indicate full values
   for RVR. FLIP abbreviations are coded to 100s of feet. Example: FLIP will indicate RVR 40
   whereas the METAR will indicate 4000ft. Thus RVR 40 = 4000ft.
   9.2.4. Passengers. Touch-and-go landings with passengers are prohibited. Touch-and-go
   landings with MEPs are authorized.
   9.2.5. Reverse thrust. Do not place the throttles in reverse during a touch-and-go landing. If
   the throttles are inadvertently taken into reverse thrust, reject the takeoff. Rejected takeoffs
   will not be practiced.
   9.2.6. Heavy jets. Do not perform touch-and-go landings when 747, C-5 or 757 aircraft are
   operating in the VFR pattern. Apply appropriate spacing to provide adequate wake
   turbulence avoidance.
   9.2.7. Stop-and-go-landings. Stop-and-go-landings are not authorized.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   107


   9.2.8. Minimum Runway for Touch and Go Landings. The minimum runway for touch and
   go landings is per the AFM or Table 9.1, whichever is greater. For all aircraft, ensure
   aircraft performance assures full stop capability corrected for [configuration, pressure
   altitude (density altitude if appropriate), temperature, RCR/RSC and crosswinds] per AFM.

9.3. Tactical Training. Accomplish tactical training, including tactical descents, arrivals, and
departures IAW AFI 11-2VIPV1, this AFI, applicable AFTTPs, and local guidance. Observe
aircraft operating limits at all times. Reference chapter 19 of this AFI.
9.4. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures.
   9.4.1. Simulated emergency procedures other than engine-out approaches and landings will
   be limited to non-critical phases of flight and will be kept to a minimum at night or in IMC.
   Simulated emergency procedures will only be conducted under direct supervision of an IP.
   Use a realistic training/evaluation approach and do not compound emergencies.
   9.4.2. Special Maneuvers. Refer to applicable MDS directives or approved Stan/Eval
   checklist handouts or guides for procedures to accomplish simulated emergency flight
   training and tactical maneuvers that are not covered in the AFM.
   9.4.3. Simulated engine failures. Simulated engine failures are not authorized at less than
   the engine-out minimum control speeds (as published in the AFM) or when any actual
   emergency exists.
       9.4.3.1. Do not perform simulated engine-out approaches at night or in IMC.
       9.4.3.2. Not Used.
   9.4.4. Do not perform no-flap or no-slat approaches at night or in IMC.
9.5. Fuel Planning.
   9.5.1. Planning Factors for Local Flights. When planning fuel requirements for local flights,
   consider planned flight training times, planned ground times between locals, and planned
   minimum landing fuel requirements, IAW chapter 17 of this AFI. Local training flights may
   be scheduled for more or less flying time with the proper coordination.
       9.5.1.1. IPs and EPs will initiate an approach to a full stop landing when fuel on board is
       equal to or less than the amount specified in chapter 17 as the minimum fuel for landing.
       Request priority handling from air traffic control if necessary.
9.6. Operating Limitations.
   9.6.1. Policy: Unless specifically authorized elsewhere in this section, do not practice
   emergency procedures that degrade aircraft performance or flight control capabilities (in-
   flight).
       9.6.1.1. In an actual emergency, terminate all training and flight maneuvers practice.
       Training should be resumed only when the PIC determines it is safe to do so.

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
                 NUCLEAR THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations
of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRN threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated
environment. If crews are not trained or equipped to operate in the CBRN environment, this
chapter is for information only.
10.2. Understanding the CBRN Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or
   absorb into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5
   percent bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of
   removing chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in ―flu-like symptoms‖ is
   actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called ―dirty
   bomb,‖ is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   and radiation. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear detonation can
   damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of shielding, distance
   from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
10.3. CBRN Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRN attack. Passive defense measures
include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRN threat through
contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
112                                                         AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


  10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
  defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: inflight diversion,
  survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
  equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
      10.3.1.1. Inflight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRN
      attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
      at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
      controlling OPORD
      10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
      reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
      aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
      the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just
      landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down
      engines and avoid running environmental control systems. Close aircraft doors, don
      Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal protective cover on the base. If
      time does not permit using base facilities, remain in the sealed aircraft for a minimum of
      one-hour after the attack and/or follow host-base guidance.
      10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
      contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
      and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
      contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
      the senior transportation commander.
  10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
  protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.
  Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and
  hardening of facilities.
      10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for
      aircrew members is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE
      includes the newer Aircrew Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) above the
      shoulders and the CWU-66/P or CWU-77/P Integrated Aircrew Chemical Coverall
      (IACC). The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of the protective mask, C2 series
      canister (or filter element for MCU-2A/P protective mask), and over garment, boots, and
      gloves. The ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents.
      They do not provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or nuclear detonation.
      The ACDE requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures and AFE
      expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination Control Area (ACCA).
      (Note: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A series mask).
         10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at
         home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times
         while in a CBRN threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag
         contents and correct sizes.
         10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination
         is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations can represent the highest threat to
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                  113


         aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents
         is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate
         ground duties from air duties.
     10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
     contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
     such as the ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is
     to employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest
     and relief accommodations, as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free
     zone. All pressurization systems should be shut down and doors sealed if the crew finds
     itself in need of immediate protection. Crewmembers should avail themselves of
     facilities, if provided, on the airfield.
     10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
     strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
     reduce the potential of vapor exposure, personnel should consider the use of facilities
     above the first floor.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
  Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
  performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
     10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
     practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
     measures.
     10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
         10.3.3.2.1. Inflight Decontamination.           Air washing is a useful inflight
         decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
         surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
         characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
         screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
         altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
         (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
         around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
         into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is
         recommended.
         10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
         equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
         assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
         government control.
     10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility
     Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a
     method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
     limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
     environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
 114                                                          AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


       the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
       flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
       exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
       or visa versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
       through HQ AMC/A3X.
10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN
   weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should
   emphasize ACDE wear, crew coordination, CBRN hazards and countermeasures, inflight
   diversion, plans for onload/offload in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return
   leg in the event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be
   considered in the event MOPP conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The TACC or theater C2 agency (normally through
   the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as medical pre-
   treatment for chemical/biological exposure.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to
   counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the
   greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir levels must
   be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to calculate the
   required reservoir levels.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See
   Airman‘s Manual (AFMAN 10-100). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures, and refer to
   AMCVA 11-303, AERP Donning Checklist and AMCVA 11-304, ACDE Donning Checklist,
   to ensure proper wear. When wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto
   injectors will be kept in the upper left ACDE pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body
   armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower
   right flight suit pocket. This standardized location will enable personnel to locate the
   medication should an individual be overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight
   suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper
   should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN threat area or when an alarm
   ―yellow‖ or higher has been declared. When inbound to a CBRN threat area, prior to
   descent, the aircraft commander will ensure crew and passengers don appropriate protective
   equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRN
   threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen
   requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations,
   and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the wear of the integrated survival
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                      115


   vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a
   safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the
   items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the
   aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-
   flight crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing and ACDE donning with
   assistance from ALS personnel. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a
   covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to
   prevent contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they
   will require assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective
   overcape and overboots prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags. Aircrew members entering the aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape
   portions of the aircrew ensemble and ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and
   placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to entering the aircraft all personnel should implement
   boot wash/decontamination procedures. Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated
   environment will don plastic overboots and overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACDE, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
   aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from
   a contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
   theater war plans. Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
   aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
   the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
   shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
   of the senior transportation commander.
   10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
   ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
   passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
   contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
 116                                                        AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


   aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. (NOTE: An altitude below
   10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.)
   10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
   resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should
   consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when
   determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
   adverse physiological effects.
   10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize
   thermal stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when
   performing in-flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing
   full GCE, and may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. To
   estimate how much time it takes to perform a task or operation, (1) take the Task Time
   Multiplier (Table 10.1) for the appropriate Work Rate and ambient air temperature and (2)
   multiply it by the time it normally takes to perform the task. For example, given a heavy
   work rate and an air temperature of 70F, the crewmember should expect a normal one hour
   task to take 2.1 hours while wearing ACDE. A more extensive discussion of this subject is
   found in AFMAN 32-4005, Personnel Protection and Attack Actions.

Table 10.1. Task Time Multipliers.
                   Work Rate                     Temperature
                                      20-49 F      50-84 F    85-100 F
                                     -6 to 9 C    10 to 28 C 29 to 38 C

                  Moderate              1.3           1.4        3.0
                  Heavy                 1.7           2.1        5.0
   10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor
   hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable levels of currently
   fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The aircrew must take
   every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the flight deck
   area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the
   remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or
   passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will
   stay in full ACDE/GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area
   (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and
   cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
   in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   117


   10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
      10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
      whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
      seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
      chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
      10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort
      (i.e. leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated
      equipment. Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent
      may still be present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact
      with agent residue is avoided.
      10.5.10.3. Table 10.2 shows times associated with initial and follow-on phases of the
      10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to use the worst
      case scenario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for the initial
      phase and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

                                           Chapter 11

                               NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. Mission Planning.
   11.1.1. The PIC or designated representative shall verify that proposed routes and flight
   altitudes/levels provide proper terrain clearance and meet FLIP, FCG and AOR requirements.
   11.1.2. The PIC or his/her delegate shall crosscheck the CFP route of flight against the route
   of flight entered on the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, DD Form 1801 or ICAO flight
   plan.
   11.1.3. If a CFP is out of date or not available and routing or meteorological information is
   desired, the PIC should obtain direct assistance from the CDS or IFM. CFPs and CFP tracks
   to assist in manual flight planning are available with a current account through the AMC
   Aircrew Portal.
   11.1.4. Flight Plan. Cross-check the CFP planned route against the route of flight entered on
   the DD Form 175 or DD Form 1801 and the approved diplomatic clearance.
11.2. Flight Charts. Complete oceanic plotting IAW para 6.33.3. of this AFI.
11.3. Navigational Aid Capability. The following airspace categories are each defined in
FLIP, and are considered special qualification airspace: MNPS, Reduced Vertical Separation
Minimum (RVSM), Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV), and RNP.
   11.3.1. North Atlantic MNPS airspace system procedures are as follows:
       11.3.1.1. MNPS standards are mandatory.
       11.3.1.2. Aircraft that lose one INS/IRS prior to airspace entry will comply with North
       Atlantic MNPS Airspace Operations Manual (as applicable) and appropriate FLIP series.
       Although the North Atlantic MNPS Airspace Operations Manual is not regulatory for
       airspace other than North Atlantic MNPS operations, it provides solid general guidance
       for operations in other oceanic regions.
       11.3.1.3. Aircraft that lose all INS/IRS capability prior to designated airspace entry may
       continue if the crew re-files outside MNPS airspace and NAVAIDs are available to
       maintain proper navigation tolerances.
   11.3.2. RVSM Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is applied is considered special
   qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved for
   operations in these areas. Refer to FLIP AP/2 and the following for RVSM requirements:
       11.3.2.1. Both primary altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and
       the transponder, must be fully operational. The PIC will request a new clearance to avoid
       this airspace should any of this equipment fail.
       11.3.2.2. Engage the autopilot during level cruise, except when circumstances such as
       the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.
       11.3.2.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out. Record
       readings of both altimeters.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                119


     11.3.2.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 feet.
     11.3.2.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating near
     other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
     11.3.2.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
     RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
     11.3.2.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM required
     equipment.
  11.3.3. BRNAV Airspace. Airspace where BRNAV is applied is considered special
  qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved for
  operations in these areas. BRNAV navigation accuracy criteria is RNP-5. Aircraft with
  integrated GPS have no BRNAV restrictions. Without GPS, aircraft must auto update every
  two hours (as required) to maintain actual centerline within +/- 5 NM of ATC cleared route.
     11.3.3.1. Minimum equipment to operate in BRNAV airspace is one INS/IRS capable of
     updates or an FAA approved GPS with RAIM or equivalent system. Flights entering
     BRNAV airspace after long overwater flight must be especially aware of BRNAV
     tolerances and update accordingly.
     11.3.3.2. Aircraft unable to maintain BRNAV tolerances must advise ATC immediately
     and take appropriate coordinated action.
     11.3.3.3. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of BRNAV required
     equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet BRNAV tolerances.
  11.3.4. RNP Airspace. Airspace where RNP is applied is considered special qualification
  airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in
  these areas. RNP airspace is being incorporated around the world to increase air traffic
  capacity by decreasing separation requirements between routes. VIP Aircraft are approved
  for RNP, but limited to operational time restrictions based on navigation equipment. These
  limitations will be annotated in local supplement and updated by unit stan/eval when
  appropriate.
     11.3.4.1. RNP-10. Compliance includes navigation accuracy within 10NM of actual
     position 95% of the time. Aircraft not possessing integrated GPS with RAIM, or
     equivalent system, are limited in how long they may operate in RNP-10 airspace. The
     following are RNP-10 requirements:
         11.3.4.1.1. Flight Planning. Verify aircraft is approved for RNP operation, assess
         mission impact and ensure appropriate code is annotated on the flight plan IAW FLIP
         GP.
         11.3.4.1.2. Preflight Procedures. Review maintenance logs to ascertain status of
         RNP-10 equipment and particular attention should be paid to navigation antennas and
         the condition of the fuselage skin in the vicinity of these antennas.
         11.3.4.1.3. Enroute. At least two long range navigation systems certified for RNP-10
         must be operational at the oceanic entry point. Periodic crosschecks will be
         accomplished to identify navigation errors and prevent inadvertent deviation from
         ATC cleared routes. Advise ATC of the deterioration or failure of navigation
 120                                                        AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


          equipment below navigation performance requirements and coordinate appropriate
          actions.
          11.3.4.1.4. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of RNP required
          equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RNP tolerances.
   11.3.5. CPDLC Operations. Refer to applicable FLIP, FAA and MDS guidance for CPDLC
   operations. Specific operations and procedures must be approved by MAJCOM/A3 with
   mission execution authority. Verify equipment and ensure appropriate code is annotated on
   the flight plan IAW FLIP GP.
11.4. Navigator Procedures. Not used.
11.5. High Latitudes/Grid Navigation/Polar Routes. Operations when flying north of 70
degrees latitude require provisions for conversion of heading systems from magnetic to true, or
operations with Grid procedures. Provisions for INS/IRS failure must be considered. Refer to
the AFM for specific procedures.
   11.5.1. Use of Polar Routes is authorized. Ensure aircraft MEL, performance capability and
   navigation capability exists for the entire route. Utilize all IFM/CDS functions and review
   polar route navigation procedures in FLIP (Arctic Control Area, NavCanada, Alaska
   Supplements, etc.). Follow MDS specific guidance for alternate planning and EROPS, if
   applicable. Ensure alternates qualify and are suitable for use. Comply with all cold
   weather/polar operations manual restrictions (fuel temperature, cold weather operations,
   etc.).
   11.5.2. Navigators. Backup grid procedures should be used when flying north of 70 degrees
   north latitude (except Alaska) and south of 60 degrees south latitude or where the
   convergence of meridians or magnetic variation changes preclude using true and magnetic
   direction references.
       11.5.2.1. INS/IRS Operation. Set compasses to computed grid heading in order to have a
       current grid heading available should INS/IRS fail.
       11.5.2.2. If INS/IRS fail, aircraft will be directed by grid heading until exiting the grid
       area.
   11.5.3. En route requirements with INS/IRS inoperative:
       11.5.3.1. Navigators. Comply with FLIP (Arctic Control Area or other applicable
       procedures). Check aircraft's grid heading each 30 minutes during the first hour after grid
       entry. Thereafter, heading checks are required every hour. When entering grid
       operation, apply convergence to the true heading. Establish the aircraft on computed true
       heading references. When exiting grid, apply variation to obtain magnetic headings to
       the flight plan to verify the accuracy of the courses measured and conversion data used.
       This will ensure the validity of initial entry headings and provide precise target headings
       for exit.
       11.5.3.2. Determine the precession information for gyros after each heading check. Do
       not reset the gyros unnecessarily. When precession is one degree or less do not reset the
       gyros since the error may be in the observation.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                  121


       11.5.3.3. If a grid heading can't be determined at the regular time interval by celestial,
       use the previous precession information to determine heading changes.
11.6. CDS/IFM. All VIP Aircraft are authorized to utilize MAJCOM approved CDS/IFM (this
includes AFMC contracted services as part of aircraft procurement/sustainment if coordinated
with the lead command). PIC is overall responsible for monitoring accuracy and completeness
of flight planning.
   11.6.1. Certified Dispatchers are authorized to mission plan, obtain/transmit weather
   information, obtain/transmit diplomatic clearance messages, compute flight plans,
   electronically file and flight follow VIP Aircraft. PIC must verify dispatch release via
   signature, verbal communication or datalink. At locations with MAF C2, PIC should
   confirm actions with CP or AMD. Secure Launch and Close Hold missions may require
   modification of planning factors. OG/CC or equivalent shall inform PIC if mission is not to
   be dispatched.
   11.6.2. Messages. CDS Dispatchers are not authorized to send official AMHS messages.
       11.6.2.1. Close Hold. Units may further restrict CDS activities to accommodate
       sensitive missions. In such cases, the unit will perform flight planning and dispatch
       services.
   11.6.3. Dip Clearances. Dispatchers may obtain diplomatic clearances. PIC‘s are
   responsible for overall border clearance, approval authority for flight plans and country
   clearance. Verify flight plan annotates appropriate diplomatic clearances for border
   clearance and safe passage.
   11.6.4. Datalink. Use of HF and VHF datalink is approved for enroute dispatch and C2
   capability. Dispatchers shall notify PIC of updated alternates and weather prior to obtaining
   clearances (departure, oceanic, approach). In any case, PICs should update enroute alternate
   weather prior to oceanic entry point via any means (HF or datalink). If unable to contact the
   crew via datalink, dispatchers should contact crew by any/all means for all planning
   problems or changes. If still unable to contact the crew, CDS/IFM must notify ARTCC, unit
   C2, CP or AMD to pass information to the aircraft.
       11.6.4.1. CPDLC. MAJCOM authorized users may use flight following and oceanic
       clearance release procedures via ATC datalink. Ensure appropriate ATS log-on
       procedures are followed (Pacific Operations Manual, CNS/ATM Asia, etc). Initiate HF
       communication (typically 15-45 minutes prior to entry) and establish log on
       communication. Ensure log on is accepted and advise ATC via HF voice if
       communication is not established. Minimize the use of free text messages. Maintain log
       of ATC datalink communications and retain with post mission paperwork at unit
       stan/eval IAW unit procedures.

                     AIRCRAFT SECURITY (RAVEN) PROCEDURES

15.1. General. This chapter outlines aircrew responsibilities and procedures for aircraft security
NCOs (RAVENs) assigned to VIP missions. On missions, they are under the authority of the
PIC. The RAVEN NCOIC will be pre-designated and will supervise the other RAVENs during
the mission.
15.2. Responsibilities. RAVENs protect Presidential, Presidential Support, and certain other
VIP missions and associated equipment according to AFI 31-101, 31-104V1, AFJI 31-102,
Physical Security and Chapter 7 of this AFI. RAVENs are responsible to the PIC, who approves
and coordinates any authorized deviations from the procedures in AFI 31-101, 31-104, and AFJI
31-102. RAVENs coordinate aircraft security protection with local military and civilian
authorities. Assure local security efforts are smoothly integrated into the total security system to
protect the aircraft. WG/CCs may authorize the use of augmentees to RAVEN teams.
15.3. Premission Procedures. All RAVENs will attend the PIC's aircrew briefing, when
applicable. EXCEPTION: When RAVENs are not collocated, ensure the RAVEN NCOIC is
verbally briefed by the PIC on the day the aircrew brief is held and that the entire RAVEN team
is briefed by the PIC on the day of departure. The RAVEN NCOIC briefs his team on mission
requirements, threat analysis, and specific duty assignments for the mission. The RAVEN
NCOIC contacts the PIC when notified of the mission and assists in coordinating advance
security support at en route destinations as required.
15.4. Preflight Procedures. RAVENs will arm themselves and will normally report to the
aircraft not later than 2 hours prior to scheduled departure time.
   15.4.1. Security Check. Conduct a complete security check of the aircraft, inside and
   outside. Assume sentry positions as directed by the RAVEN NCOIC.
   15.4.2. Mission Information. The RAVEN NCOIC is responsible for obtaining passenger
   manifests and crew orders, mission itinerary cards, en route stop cards, and the AF Form
   1109, Visitor Register Log.
   15.4.3. Aircraft Access Control. Personnel listed on the applicable unescorted entry list or
   the passenger manifest will be granted unescorted entry on the aircraft. Manifest changes are
   approved by the mission contact officer or PIC. RAVENs board the aircraft only after all
   passengers and other aircrew members have boarded.
   15.4.4. Baggage Control. One RAVEN will be positioned as a sentry at the baggage
   compartment until all baggage is loaded and the compartment is secured. Assure all baggage
   is properly identified. Cross-check baggage labels against the passenger manifest.
15.5. In-Flight Procedures. Report all security problems to the PIC. When the aircraft is
transporting space available passengers, the RAVEN NCOIC assigns team members (if required)
to occupy seats in each passenger compartment where passengers are seated. Don't allow
passengers to have access to their stowed baggage in-flight.
15.6. Post-Flight Procedures. When the aircraft blocks in, RAVENs deplane first. Take up
pre-designated positions fore and aft of the aircraft. When the baggage compartment is opened,
 126                                                       AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


one RAVEN monitors baggage unloading and remains as a sentry until the baggage
compartment is secured. If crew baggage will be out of crewmember‘s control, (e.g. clearing
customs) a RAVEN will accompany the baggage at all times. If using secured fuel supplies, one
RAVEN checks the numbered seals against the documents provided by the mission contact
officer or advance agent.
   15.6.1. Local Security. If local security forces will augment RAVENs during ground times,
   the RAVEN NCOIC will brief them on their duties and responsibilities.
   15.6.2. Miscellaneous. At least one RAVEN will always be stationed as primary sentry at
   all times. The RAVEN NCOIC schedules RAVENs for sentry duty.
15.7. Post Mission Procedures.
   15.7.1. Terminating Security Protection. If the aircraft security status is to be terminated,
   RAVENs remain at the aircraft until all passengers and baggage are unloaded and the PIC
   terminates the upgraded security status according to AFI 31-101.
   15.7.2. After Termination. When relieved, turn in weapons and ammunition to the armory.
   Comply with local debriefing requirements. The RAVEN NCOIC turns in the completed AF
   Form 1109, Visitor Register Log.
15.8. AF Form 1109, Visitor Register Log. Consult local directives concerning completion and
authentication procedures for this form.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                 127

                       FLYING CREW CHIEF (FCC) PROCEDURES

16.1. General. This chapter outlines duties and responsibilities of aircraft crew chiefs.
Normally, crew chiefs are assigned to fly on C-38 OCONUS missions. The maintenance
organization coordinates with appropriate agency (SOC or equivalent) to schedule crew chiefs to
each mission. Manning requirements are IAW chapter 3 of this AFI. The crew chief will be
listed on the flight authorization.
16.2. Responsibilities. The crew chief is the primary aircraft mechanic and performs
maintenance to maintain a mission-ready aircraft status. After reporting for a mission, the crew
chief is responsible to the PIC. As a minimum, the crew chief shall:
   16.2.1. Perform or assist aircraft servicing at all stations.
   16.2.2. Accomplish preflight, thru-flight and post-flight inspections per TO 00-20-1 and
   applicable supplements.
   16.2.3. Manage the aircraft's en route mission support kit (MSK) and log.
   16.2.4. Perform maintenance at en route stations.
   16.2.5. Perform aircraft block-out and block-in procedures.
   16.2.6. Ensure inventory of aircrew flight equipment and dash-21 equipment is
   accomplished, as the PIC‘s representative.
   16.2.7. Maintain the AFTO 781 series. Inform PIC of all maintenance discrepancies entered
   in AFTO 781A.
   16.2.8. Be responsible for the DD Form 1896 and Multi Service Card.
   16.2.9. Be responsible for AF Form 15 and handle all aircraft related payments on aircraft.
16.3. Procedures. Attend the PIC‘s pre-mission aircrew briefing. Brief the PIC on status of the
aircraft, recent maintenance history, and MSK concerns. Discuss requirements for aerospace
ground equipment (AGE) and servicing requirements needed at each stop. Confirm aircraft
configuration.
   16.3.1. For All Departures. Assure the required fuel load, as briefed by the PIC, is aboard.
   Ensure completion of the pre-departure checklist (if applicable) and all required MSK items
   are aboard aircraft. Aircraft positioning will be accomplished by taxiing aircraft with
   qualified aircrew members or by towing aircraft by maintenance support personnel to
   terminal or DV spot when required. Ensure required AGE is available and connect to aircraft
   as required. Ensure AFTO forms are properly completed. Assist aircraft baggage/cargo
   loading to ensure weight and balance criteria is properly maintained. Report any deviations
   to PIC.
   16.3.2. In-flight Duties. FCCs will not perform in flight duties/maintenance unless in the
   opinion of the PIC an emergency condition exists requiring FCC‘s assistance.
   16.3.3. For All Arrivals (Intermediate or Overnight). Perform scanner duties outside of the
   aircraft (as required) during ground operations as required by the PIC. Deplane before DV
 128                                                        AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


   and passengers. Ensure aircraft is safely blocked-in. Coordinate necessary ground support
   and equipment for departure and servicing procedures. Accomplish all servicing and
   perform required maintenance. Perform any required inspections. Ensure required AGE is
   available for departure.
       16.3.3.1. For Overnight Stops. Accomplish post-flight inspections. Perform or assist all
       servicing operations. Install required FOD/dust covers and plugs IAW the AFM.
   16.3.4. If Maintenance Is Required. When aircraft parts are required, use available MSK
   parts to the maximum extent possible. Coordinate with PIC before ordering or purchasing
   parts from available sources. Always determine the applicable part number through the
   Illustrated Parts Catalog, or contracted servicing partner prior to ordering and/or purchasing
   parts. Coordinate with the PIC to determine delivery location for all shipped parts. Ensure
   home station maintenance is informed and can aid in coordination for parts. Advise unit C2
   (CP or AMD) of estimated ETIC for dispatch release. Typically, ETIC = parts delivery time
   to aircraft + job completion time. Communicate this time to PIC when able.
   16.3.5. On Return to Home Station. Comply with local debriefing requirements. Replace
   (or back order) any used MSK items. Turn in all AF Form 15 and AF Form 664 to unit
   resource manager.
16.4. Authority to Clear Red X Symbols in the AFTO 781A. IAW TO 00-20-1, when
authorized by the home station maintenance group commander and CLS agreement, certified
FCCs are authorized to clear red X write-ups.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                    129

                                       FUEL PLANNING

17.1. Fuel Requirements. This paragraph implements standard minimum fuel requirements
and will be used in conjunction with procedures established in the C-38 AFM.
17.2. General. As a minimum, required ramp fuel will consist of all fuel required for engine
start, taxi, warm-up, APU operation, takeoff, climb, cruise, en route reserves (if required),
alternate/approach/missed approach (if required), descent, approach, and landing.
17.3. Reserve Fuel Planning. Plan a 45-minute fuel reserve at destination or alternate (when an
alternate is required).
   17.3.1. Reserve fuel will be computed using consumption rates providing maximum
   endurance at 10,000 feet MSL at destination gross weight. If an alternate is required,
   compute using weight at alternate destination. When computing reserve fuel for remote
   destinations, use consumption rates providing maximum endurance at 20,000 feet MSL.
   17.3.2. En route reserve fuel. Compute using 10% of the flight time fuel over Class II
   airspace, not to exceed 1 hour at normal cruise OR contingency fuel as designated on
   commercially dispatched flight plans.
17.4. Alternate Fuel Planning. If required, plan fuel to an alternate IAW AFI 11-202V3 and
chapter 6 of this regulation.
   17.4.1. If two alternates are required, compute fuel from destination to most distant alternate.
   17.4.2. For remote destinations, holding is authorized in lieu of an alternate airport. In such
   situations, use 2+00 reserve fuel (1+15 holding in lieu of an alternate and 0+45 fuel reserve
   IAW 17.3).
   17.4.3. When determining fuel required for holding in lieu of an alternate, compute using
   holding tables at 20,000 feet MSL at destination gross weight.
17.5. Equal Time Points (ETPs).
   17.5.1. If the flying time to a suitable alternate airfield exceeds 60 minutes, computed at
   10,000 feet, single-engine cruise speed, in still air, from any point along the route of flight,
   computation of an ETP is required. ETPs may be computed by MAJCOM certified CFPs.
   Annotate it along the planned route of flight on the OPC/Global Navigation Chart.
   17.5.2. Compute ETPs according to the following formula:


D - distance in nautical miles between destination field and recovery field (not necessarily the
departure field).
GSR - average ground speed to continue to return to a recovery field at 10,000 feet. To compute
groundspeed, apply forecast headwind/tailwind component at 10,000 feet to true airspeed.
GSC - average ground speed to continue to destination at 10,000 feet.
Example: D = 1040nm, 10,000 feet winds forecast 60 kt headwind to continue, 80 kt tailwind to
 130                                                           AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012


return, TAS at 10,000 feet, Long Range Cruise (LRC), is 324 kts at std day, 86,000 lb gross wt.


NOTE: The computation above will yield an ETP based on recovering or continuing at 10,000
feet. This is the most limiting case, and will ensure an accurate ETP in the event of an
emergency such as a rapid decompression.
17.6. Safety. PICs must ensure that all factors be considered when determining ramp fuel. For
all aircraft, factor in payload and the risk involved in fuel planning over oceanic and
mountainous regions and the resultant OEI performance capability during all phases of the flight.
Consider fuel needed at ETPs and en route alternate suitability. Finally, consider weather
patterns at the destination alternate. If it is too close to a poor weather destination, increase ramp
fuel to provide a more suitable alternate.
17.7. Fuel Conservation. Aircrew and mission planners will manage aviation fuel as a limited
commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will be considered throughout all phases of
mission planning and execution. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross weight
and increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe
mission accomplishment and training objectives. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize
flight plans and flight routing for fuel efficiency. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent
profiles and power settings should also be considered for efficient fuel usage. Aircrew should
employ the following aviation fuel optimization measures without compromising flight safety or
jeopardizing mission/training accomplishment:
   17.7.1. Use optimized CFPs when possible. LRC and optimum altitude should be flown.
   Limit the use of the APU when possible. Delay engine start. Cruise Center of Gravity (CG)
   should be aft if practical. Fly en route descents when possible.
   17.7.2. Normal cruise speed for the C-38 is Maximum Continuous Thrust. Do not exceed
   FAR or host nation aircraft speed restrictions.
   17.7.3. Extra fuel (identified/unidentified) may be added to required ramp fuel load.
   Unidentified fuel allows crews some flexibility when dealing with unplanned contingencies
   (e.g., unreliable NAVAIDs, weather avoidance, ATC delays, etc.) and should be kept to a
   minimum. Do not carry extra fuel for convenience; roughly 3 percent of the excess will be
   burned each hour. Use the following guidelines when determining extra fuel requirements:
       17.7.3.1. When fuel availability is limited or not available at en route stops.
       17.7.3.2. When compressed ground times during single multi-day sortie missions
       preclude refueling at en route stops.
       17.7.3.3. When en route refueling would delay or be detrimental to mission
       accomplishment.
       17.7.3.4. For known holding delays in excess of standard.
       17.7.3.5. For anticipated off course weather avoidance to include avoidance of forecast
       turbulence detrimental to passenger comfort.
AFI11-2C-38V3 21 MARCH 2012                                                                       131


       17.7.3.6. If decompression with passengers would cause a descent to an unplanned
       altitude resulting in consumption in excess of planned fuel; add fuel to recover at a
       suitable alternate at the appropriate altitude.
       17.7.3.7. To offset increased fuel consumption due to icing.
       17.7.3.8. When destination NAVAIDs, ATC services, or landing aids are unreliable or
       insufficient.
17.8. Fuel Limitations. VIP Aircraft are not allowed to operate on JP-8+100 except in
emergency conditions. If inadvertent refueling with JP-8+100 occurs, the aircraft will be
immediately de-fueled prior to flight. All JP-8+100 locations are required to maintain a clean
JP-8 capability to support transient aircraft. Every effort must be made not to allow aircraft
flight while serviced with JP-8+100. If emergency refueling occurs utilizing JP-8+100, flight
crews will make an AFTO 781 entry stating, ―CAUTION: Aircraft refueled using JP-8+100,
preventive measures must be taken when de-fueling. Close coordination with maintenance and
POL fuels personnel must be accomplished.‖
17.9. Aircraft Specific Fuel Planning. As a minimum, comply with AFI 11-202V3 fuel
requirements and the following:

Table 17.1. C-38 Fuel Planning Chart.
         Fuel Load Component                                      Requirement
 1. APU, Start, Taxi, Takeoff                200 pounds

 2. En route 1                               Fuel for planned climb and cruise to overhead
                                             destination at cruise altitude or initial approach fix
                                             altitude

 3. En route reserve                         Fuel for 10 percent of flight time over Class II route
                                             or route segments at normal cruise

 4. Approach and landing                     200 pounds

 5. Alternate, required by paragraph         Fuel from overhead destination to the alternate at
 6.18.2                                      normal speed and altitude

 6. Minimum fuel required at                 1000 pounds
 destination, or landing at alternate ( if
 an alternate is required IAW 11-
 203V3)

 NOTES:
 (1) Include all planned off-course maneuvering for departure or en route deviations.
 (2) When two alternates are required, compute fuel from the destination to the most distant
 alternate only.

   17.9.1. Minimum fuel is 800 pounds. Crews should plan to terminate all missions with not
   less than 800 pounds. When operating in FAA airspace, pilots will declare ―minimum fuel‖
   to the controlling agency when in their judgment the aircraft may land at the intended
   destination with less than these amounts.
   17.9.2. Emergency fuel is 600 pounds. Crews will declare an emergency whenever it is
   determined that they will land with emergency fuel or less.
   17.9.3. Fuel Computations for Class II Routing. When flying along a Class II routing, crews
   should ensure they have enough fuel to complete the flight from the equal time point (ETP).
   Consider worst case recovery with one-engine inoperative or two-engine unpressurized.
   Calculate Class II fuel reserve as 10% of flight time fuel over the Class II route/route
   segment, not to exceed 1+00 fuel at normal cruise.
   17.9.4. Standard Ramp Fuel Loads. This is normally the minimum fuel load for all missions
   departing home station. If you require less than the standard fuel load due to runway length
   or conditions at nearby destinations, notify the squadron operations center immediately.
   They will advise maintenance who will take action to refuel or de-fuel your aircraft to
   desired fuel load. Aircraft will not be de-fueled solely for the purposes of fuel conservation.
   Standard ramp fuel loads, planned local training flying times, scheduled ground times
   between locals, and minimum landing fuel are in Table 17.2 Standard Fuel Loads and Local
   Turn Times.
