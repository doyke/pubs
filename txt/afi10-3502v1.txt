     1.4.1. IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify PJ and CRO personnel in basic
     ground and flight duties without regard to a unit's mission. Upon completion of IQT PJ and
     CRO personnel will be designated UJ and immediately move into MQT. For GA, IQT does
     not result in a long-term qualification status.
AFI10-3502V1 16 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                     9


   1.4.2. MQT provides the training necessary to qualify or re-qualify PJ and CRO personnel in
   ground and flight duties integral to specific unit assigned missions. PJ and CRO personnel
   will maintain UJ status while performing flight duties until they complete MQT. MQT
   completion is a pre-requisite for Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status. PJ and CRO
   personnel will not deploy or perform operational missions until MQT is complete. PJ
   personnel who have completed MQT will be designated Mission PJs (MJP). CRO personnel
   who have completed MQT will be designated Mission CROs (MJC). CRO TC upgrade is a
   mandatory part of CRO MQT.
   1.4.3. CT consists of training in the basic skills contained in Table 5.1 plus any unit- specific
   training required to accomplish the unit's assigned missions. CT is a program designed to
   focus training on capabilities needed to accomplish broad spectrum Personnel Recovery (PR)
   and maintain CMR status.
       1.4.3.1. CMR status is the minimum training for PJ and CRO personnel to be current and
       qualified in all primary missions tasked to their assigned unit IAW this instruction and
       AFI 10-3502V2.
       1.4.3.2. All PJ and CRO personnel will maintain CMR status by accomplishing all CMR
       training events IAW Table 5.1. Failure to complete the training/currency IAW Table 5.1
       will result in Non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived IAW this instruction.
       1.4.3.3. Only PJ and CRO positions above the wing level may be designated as Key Staff
       positions. Individuals assigned to key staff positions are required to complete only those
       training events noted IAW Table 5.1 considered mission qualified and will continue to fly
       as MJs. Key Staff personnel will be evaluated only on those training events for which
       currency is maintained IAW AFI 10-1312V2. Personnel so designated are considered
       BMC unless they accomplish all CMR training events IAW Table 5.1. Appropriate
       MFM is designation authority for NAF and MAJCOM Key Staff positions.
NOTE: AETC Detachment, Squadron, Group and Wing level may be designated as Key Staff;
however they must be current and qualified in all tasks and currencies in which they provide
instruction. AETC MFM is designation authority for Det., Squadron, Group and Wing Key Staff
positions.
       1.4.3.4. N-CMR and BMC PJ and CRO personnel may perform missions in support of
       civil authorities, DoD assets and unsupervised training missions only in events where
       currency and qualification has been maintained.
       1.4.3.5. N-CMR and BMC personnel will not be deployed or utilized on any tactical-
       level combat mission unless waivered IAW this instruction. N-CMR personnel may be
       deployed to meet operational-level or higher requirements (Joint Personnel Recovery
       Center, Personnel Recovery Coordination Cell, etc.).
       1.4.3.6. Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skills
       necessary to carry out the unit's assigned mission that may not be required by every PJ
       and/or CRO. Specialized training consists of upgrade training such as trainer/instructor
       upgrade, Tandem Master, Advanced Military Freefall, etc., as well as CT to maintain
       proficiency and qualification in unit tasked special capabilities and missions. Specialized
       training is accomplished after PJ and/or CRO personnel have attained CMR status.
       Unless otherwise specified, PJ and CRO personnel in CMR or Key Staff positions may
 10                                                        AFI10-3502V1 16 FEBRUARY 2011


       attain and maintain specialized certification provided applicable training/currency as long
       as any additional training requirements are accomplished.
       1.4.3.7. Common Skills Training. PJ and CRO trainers/instructors may conduct training
       for tasks common to both AFSCs. PJ or CRO specific training will be conducted within
       AFSC only.
NOTE: Other AFSC trainer/instructor personnel may train/instruct/certify IQT, MQT, UGT, CT
and specialized training in like events but must utilize the PJ or CRO TCSs.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies. The overall objective is to develop and maintain a high
state of mission readiness, facilitating immediate and effective employment in exercises,
homeland defense, irregular warfare, and conventional campaigns. Though not all inclusive,
training should be structured to provide mission capability based on employment concepts
identified in Joint Pub (JP) 3-50 Personnel Recovery; Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 3-
50 Personnel Recovery Operations; AFPD 16-12, AFPD 3-05 Special Operations, Air Force
Tactics Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1 and 3-3 Guardian Angel; the unit Designed
Operational Capability (DOC) statement; and approved unit METLs and TCSs.
   1.5.1. Units will design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron tasked
   roles, maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. Training
   missions should emphasize either basic combat skills, or scenarios that reflect procedures and
   operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition
   capabilities. Use of procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios are desired (e.g.,
   appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery
   procedures, tactical deception, Intel briefing/debriefing). Tactical training will include use of
   live fire exercises, full mission profiles, realistic medical scenarios, and include C2 nodes and
   reintegration as much as possible.
   1.5.2. PJ and CRO personnel will be afforded a minimum of two hours of the standard duty
   day to maintain fitness levels required to perform the PR mission. PR operations require a
   level of physical fitness above the normal USAF standard. The ability to provide sustained
   performance coupled with rapid recovery from exertion is critical to successfully execute
   physically and mentally demanding PR mission profiles.
1.6. Failure to complete training. If a PJ or a CRO fails to successfully complete initial, re-
qualification, or upgrade training, or a repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal performance
occurs, then the individual should be considered for removal from training and/or permanent
disqualification from the PJ or CRO AFSC, IAW AFI 36-2201, AFI 11-402, Aviation and
Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, and/or other applicable AF policy.
1.7. Intra-command and Inter-command Transfer of PJ and CRO personnel. Validated
training completed prior to transfer will be honored by the gaining command. Members
qualified in one command are considered qualified in like equipment and to the same level
throughout the force when used for the same mission. Current and qualified PJ and CRO
personnel transferring to a new unit will upon arrival:
   1.7.1. Complete in-processing requirements IAW this AFI and gaining unit requirements.
   1.7.2. Complete PCS currency events, as required IAW this AFI.
   1.7.3. Complete MAJCOM/unit-specific MQT requirements, if applicable.

1.8. Training Records and Reports. The PJ OJT record and CRO ITEF meet and satisfy the
requirement for individual training records IAW AFI 11-202 V1, Aircrew Training, AFI 36-
2201, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management and appropriate MAJCOM directives.
   1.8.1. Tracking CRO Training. All training, certification, and documentation remains under
   the ITEF for IQT and upgrade training. The 13DXA ITEF, if used as a JQS, is the sole
   source document for recording all task training.
   1.8.2. Tracking PJ Training. All training, certification, and documentation remains directly
   under the Enlisted Specialty Training (EST) and/or OJT system. The 1T2XX PJ CFETP is
   the sole source document for recording all task training.
   1.8.3. PJ and CRO personnel will document training accomplishment on the IMT 1522,
   ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Report, or the Squadron Training
   Accomplishment Report (TAR) IAW MAJCOM/unit Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).
   This data will be input into the ARMS by squadron ARMS personnel.
   1.8.4. Units will use the date of the last Formal Training Unit (FTU) equivalent event
   accomplished to fill in ARMS "NO DATEs‖ for continuation training requirements.
1.9. PJ and CRO Utilization Policy.
   1.9.1. GA personnel’s overall objective is to perform combat-related duties. Supervisors may
   assign PJ and CRO personnel to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, Flying Evaluation
   Board/mishap board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as
   level of tasking, proficiency, currency, and experience.
   1.9.2. PJ and CRO personnel may be assigned to additional duties IAW published directives.
   These duties may be at SQ, GP and WG level and include but are not limited to Flight
   Commander/NCOIC, Weapons Officer, Tactician, Safety Officer, mobility/contingency
   plans officer, training NCO, Standardization/Evaluation officer/NCO, squadron aircrew
   flight equipment officer/logistics officer, and other duties directly related to mission
   operations.

   outlined in this instruction, AFI 36-2201series and AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military
   Personnel. PJs must complete all mandatory training requirements outlined in this AFI and
   the 1T2XX CFETP for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels.
   4.1.2. EL Qualification. EL training will be completed IAW 1T2XX CFETP. MAJCOMs are
   encouraged to create specific training iterations or full mission profiles to enhance the EL
   upgrade process. After successful completion of EL upgrade, including any AFI 10-3502V2
   evaluation requirements, PJs are awarded Special Experience Identifier (SEI) 340.
NOTE: The PJ EL QTP is located on the GA CoP.
   4.1.3. TL Qualification. TL training will be completed IAW 1T2XX CFETP. After
   successful completion of TL upgrade, including any AFI 10-3502V2 evaluation
   requirements, PJs are awarded SEI 341.
NOTE: The PJ TL QTP is located on the GA CoP.
4.2. CRO Upgrade Training
   4.2.1. CROs must complete all mandatory training requirements as outlined in this
   instruction, AFI 36-2101, and the CRO ITEF for award of the 1, 3, and 4 skill level.
   Currently there is no SEI for Team Commander upgrade.
4.3. Common Skills Training. PJ and CRO trainers/instructors may conduct training for tasks
common to both AFSCs. PJ or CRO specific training will be conducted within AFSC only.
NOTE: Other AFSC trainer/instructor personnel may instruct skill-level UGT in like events but
must utilize the PJ or CRO TCSs.
4.4. Certification. PJs and CROs do not, as a rule, require third party certification on tasks
listed in their respective training records. There is however a small set of skills which require
further certification before PJ and CRO personnel may perform them unsupervised. These skills
are identified by AFCFMs in the ITEF for CROs and in the CFETP for PJs.

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

5.1. General. Continuation Training covers basic GA capabilities. These requirements are to
maintain currency only and do not equate to proficiency. This chapter outlines CT requirements
to maintain CMR status.
   5.1.1. CMR Status
       5.1.1.1. CMR status results from completing IQT, MQT, maintaining all CT
       requirements and completing all AF ancillary training requirements.
       5.1.1.2. N-CMR status results from failure to meet any of the requirements listed in para.
       5.1.1.1. certain CT requirements. Unless noted, CMR currencies are go/no-go for that
       currency event only.
       5.1.1.3. Non-Training (NT) status results from failure to meet designated requirements.
       No continuation or upgrade training will be conducted until requirements are met. NT
       currencies are go/no-go items for all training events except those necessary to prepare for
       an overdue or failed recurring certification.
       5.1.1.4. Grounded (G) status results from failure to meet designated requirements.
       Individuals will not fly until training is completed. G currencies are considered go/no-go
       currencies for all flying events.
   5.1.2. CT event frequency is determined by PJ or CRO experience levels.
       5.1.2.1. PJ 3/5 levels are considered inexperienced for the purposes of CT. CT events
       will be accomplished using frequencies listed in the inexperienced column of Table 5.1.
       5.1.2.2. CROs are considered inexperienced for the purposes of CT until they have held
       the TC designation for three years. CT events will be accomplished using frequencies
       listed in the inexperienced column of Table 5.1.
       5.1.2.3. PJ 7/9 levels are considered experienced for the purposes of CT. CT events will
       be accomplished using frequencies listed in the experienced column of Table 5.1.
       5.1.2.4. CROs are considered experienced for the purposes of CT once they have held
       the TC designation for three years. CT events will be accomplished using frequencies
       listed in the experienced column of Table 5.1.
5.2. Combat Mission Ready Training Requirements.

Table 5.1. defines currency requirements for all PJ and CRO personnel.
   5.2.1. If an event’s frequency is exceeded, that event may not be performed except for the
   purpose of regaining currency. Currency will be regained under supervision of a certifier or
   instructor as defined in the 1T2X1 CFETP part 2 who is current and qualified in the same
   task to the same or greater level required by the CFETP.
   5.2.2. Events in which a periodic currency has been established will be considered trained
   and qualified to the specified level in the event until 181 days following the expiration of the
   currency. After this period the member must be retrained IAW a SQ/CC directed retraining,
 20                                                              AFI10-3502V1 16 FEBRUARY 2011


   recertification or requalification program. Qualification events require the completion of all
   evaluations for the event in question IAW AFI 10-3502V2. The SQ/CC will approve
   adjustments to the training program based on individual experience level and training
   requirements. SQ/CC approved training must be documented in the individual CFETP or
   ITEF.
   5.2.3. PJ and CRO personnel will remain CMR for the duration of a
   contingency/deployment provided they were current at time of departure. Upon return, all
   overdue currencies will be regained IAW para. 5.2.1.

      PHYSICAL FITNESS CERTIFICATION GRADING CRITERIA AND SCORING

The order for conducting the evaluation is: 3-mile run, pull-ups, sit-ups, pushups, and 1500-
meter swim. After the 3-mile run, a rest of no more than 15 minutes is given prior to starting the
calisthenics. Calisthenics events will be tested one after the other with approximately 2-minutes
rest between events. Upon completion of all calisthenics events, a rest of no more than 15
minutes is given prior to starting the 1500M swim. Failure to meet the physical fitness standard
for any event constitutes failure of the entire test. Score IAW para. A3.6. The test is intended to
mirror the AF PFT requirements so that measurements can be recorded at appropriate intervals
for dual credit (when/if dual credit is approved in the future). i.e. Annotate time at 1.5 mile;
number of sit up and push up reps at one minute.
A3.1. Three-Mile Run. This exercise is performed in running shoes. This exercise is designed
to measure aerobic endurance during specific mission tasks. Endurance is required to perform
overland movement, climbing, load-bearing, and hand-to-hand combat tasks.
A3.1.1. Q. Greater than or equal to 120, 110, 100 points based on age.
   A3.1.2. U. Less than 120,110,100 points based on age.
A3.2. Pull ups time limit: one minute). This exercise is executed on a pull-up bar. The
individual grasps the bar with the palms away from the face, shoulder width apart. This is a two-
count exercise. The exercise begins in the ―dead hang‖ position. Count one; pull the body
directly upward until the chin is over the bar. Count two, lower the body until the body is again
in the ―dead hang‖ position. Individuals will not swing excessively or bicycle feet as the chin is
pulled over the bar. Repeat as many times as possible. This exercise is designed to measure
strength and endurance in the back/shoulder and triceps/biceps muscles used during specific
mission tasks. Strength and endurance in these muscle groups are required to perform parachute
control and climbing tasks.
   A3.2.1. Q. Greater than or equal to 40 points.
   A3.2.2. U. Less than 40 points.
A3.3. Sit-ups (time limit: two minutes). Start with the back flat on the ground, knees bent at
approximately a 90-degree angle, arms crossed over the chest with the hands at the shoulders,
resting on the upper chest. Another individual may hold the feet during the exercise or secured
under an anchored ―toe-hold‖ bar. This is a two-count exercise. Count one; sit up until elbows
contact the thigh or knee. Count two, return to the starting position. If an individual raises
buttocks from ground or his hands/fingers break contact with the chest/shoulders during a
repetition, the repetition is not counted. The only authorized rest position is in the up position.
This exercise is designed to measure strength and endurance in abdominal and hip flexor muscle
groups used during specific mission tasks. Strength and endurance in these muscle groups are
required to perform swimming, lifting, and load-bearing and hand-to-hand combat tasks.
   A3.3.1. Q. Greater than or equal to 40 points.
   A3.3.2. U. Less than 40 points.
AFI10-3502V1 16 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                    39


A3.4. Pushups (time limit: two minutes). This exercise starts from the front leaning rest
position. The body must be maintained straight from head to heels with knees together. This is a
two-count exercise. Count one; flex the elbows, lowering the body until the elbows form a 90-
degree angle. Count two; raise the body until the elbows are straight and locked. Repeat this
exercise as many times as possible. Event is stopped when individual lifts an arm or a knee
touches the ground. The only authorized rest position is the starting position. This exercise is
designed to measure the strength and endurance of the chest and triceps muscles used during
specific mission tasks. Strength and endurance in these muscle groups are required to perform
swimming, lifting, climbing, load-bearing and hand-to-hand combat tasks.
   A3.4.1. Q. Greater than or equal to 40 points.
   A3.4.2. U. Less than 40 points.
A3.5. 1500 Meter Swim. The swim may be performed with swim trunks, facemask, or goggles,
snorkel, and fins using any stroke. If swim is performed in open water, a life preserver/flotation
device must be worn (exempt when within 100m of shore and/or a safety boat is in attendance).
10 minutes will be added to maximum times in the score chart for open water swims. This
exercise is designed to measure aerobic endurance and swimming ability during specific mission
tasks. Endurance and swimming ability are required to perform maritime transits as well as
underwater dive recovery tasks.
   A3.5.1. Q. Greater than or equal to 120, 110, 100 points based on age.
   A3.5.2. U. Less than 120,110,100 points based on age.
A3.6. Score. Exercise, run and swim times will be rounded off to the next lower point value as
depicted in the score chart . A composite score of all events determines the overall score. A
total score greater than or equal to 430 is a Q, greater than or equal to 320 but less than 430 is a
Q-, and less than 320 is a U.
NOTE: Failing to meet the minimum standards in anyone of the areas assessed will result in an
overall U/Failure regardless of total score.
