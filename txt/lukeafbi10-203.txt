Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This version
changes the OPR to 56 FW Command Section (56 FW/CCCE), removes the requirement for
base detail monitors, and changes the detail tasking process and response procedures. Changes
include renaming LUKEAFBI 36-2601 to LUKEAFBI 10-203.
1. Definitions.
   1.1. Base Details. These are temporary tasks, beyond the responsibility or capability of any
   one unit, that have a wing-wide impact. A special task is of a temporary nature, separate and
   apart from primary or additional duties, which is required by directive or command policy,
 2                                                             LUKEAFBI10-203 17 JULY 2012


     and must be accomplished outside the personnel resources of the OPR. Base details are
     shared on an equitable basis, based upon each unit’s assigned strength.
     1.2. Additional Duties. These are duties assigned permanently, or for specified time periods,
     rather than on a one-time bases. Additional duties are not base details, and are not governed
     by this instruction (for example, Unit Security Manager, Safety Monitor, Unit Advisory
     Council Member, etc.).
     1.3. Requester. The person, or unit, asking for a base detail to accomplish a particular task.
     1.4. Tasked Agency. The unit, or staff agency, tasked to supply personnel for a base detail.
2. Detail Requirements. The Air Force’s mission requires certain base details be performed.
Many are not within the capability of the responsible activity. Others must be performed by
disinterested personnel, not assigned to the OPR.
3. Policy:
     3.1. All military and civilian personnel are eligible to perform base details. The details
     civilian employees are assigned to will be reasonably related to duties outlined in their
     official position descriptions (for example, wage grade employees wouldn’t reasonably be
     expected to perform administrative-type duties or vice versa). Detail duty assignments must
     be consistent with the civilian employees’ experience, training, and qualifications.
     3.2. Base details take people away from their primary duties and assigned unit’s mission.
     Therefore, commanders should ensure base details are kept to the minimum required to
     accomplish the mission.
     3.3. Wing Exemptions. An exemption is a permanent exclusion from performing a base
     detail tasking based on mission requirements. Letters of exemption must be signed by the
     squadron commander, approved by the group commander, and forwarded to the 56 FW Vice
     Commander (56 FW/CV) for approval. Exemption letters are due to the Base Detail
     Manager (BDM) by the first Monday of each month for approval by the vice commander for
     possible inclusion into this instruction. Base detail taskings will be shared on a proportional
     basis based upon assigned personnel, minus wing authorized exemptions.                  Group
     commander’s authorizing non-wing exemptions, within their group, are responsible for
     filling their proportional detail tasking. The following categories of individuals are wing
     exempt from performing base details:
        3.3.1. Commander, staff agency chiefs (two-letter office symbols), and first sergeants.
        3.3.2. Primary aircrew members. Exception: may be tasked to serve as evaluation
        officers for line-of-duty investigations.
        3.3.3. Professional officers (chaplains, attorneys, dentists, physicians, nurses, and
        biomedical service officers engaged in direct patient care). Exception: may be detailed
        for tasks specifically related to the professional specialty.
        3.3.4. Command Post shift workers (AFSC 13B3E and 1C3X1).
        3.3.5. Fire Department and Ambulance personnel (AFSC 3E7X1).
        3.3.6. Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel (AFSC 3E8X1).

       4.2.5. Send taskings directly to the group superintendents.
