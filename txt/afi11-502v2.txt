                                            PURPOSE

1.1. SUAS-O              Standardization/Evaluation            Program. The             SUAS-O
Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Program is designed to ensure a high degree of
effectiveness in accomplishing the mission of the SUAS force. This will be achieved by
command supervision, employment of standard SUAS-O tasks, use of standard publications, and
maintenance of a disciplined SUAS-O force by administration of frequent tests and flight
evaluations. The purpose of the SUAS-O Stan/Eval Program is to provide commanders a tool to
validate mission readiness and evaluate the effectiveness of individual SUAS-Os to include
qualifications and capabilities. AFI 11-502 volumes 1, 2, and 3 draw from the respective AFI 11-
202volumes 1, 2, and 3, with modifications tailored to Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems;
knowledge of the AFI 11-202 series is highly encouraged in order to fully understand the
parallels and differences between systems and their supporting instructions.
1.2. Objectives. Specific program objectives are to:
     1.2.1. Provide a system to assess and document individual SUAS-O proficiency and the
     capability to accomplish assigned tasks.
     1.2.2. Develop and ensure standardization of operational procedures for SUAS employment.
     1.2.3. Ensure compliance with appropriate operational, training, and administrative
     directives.
     1.2.4. Evaluate and revise operational directives, procedures, and techniques as required.
     1.2.5. Recognize trends and recommend/initiate changes to training programs and directives.
1.3. Waiver Authority. Unless otherwise specified, HAF/A3O-AS is the waiver authority for
this instruction. Waivers to the basic guidance in this instruction will be requested through
Stan/Eval channels to MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent level IAW AFI 11-215. MAJCOM/A3s will
forward request in message or memo format to HAF/A3O-AS, with a copy to HQ
AFSOC/A3OU. Waivers to supplemental guidance will be approved by the MAJCOM agency
that generated the supplement. Unless otherwise specified, waivers to this Instruction will be
valid for a period of 12 months from approval date. Units assigned, attached, or under
operational control of a geographic combatant command will request waivers through the
Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) who may approve, disapprove, or forward to
HAF/A3O-AS for resolution, with a copy to HQ AFSOC/A3OU (Exception: Air Force Material
command (AFMC) is not required to send a copy to HQ AFSOC/A3OU). Waiver authority for
supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement.
1.4. Key Definitions:
     1.4.1. ―Will‖ and ―Shall‖ indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.4.2. ―Should‖ indicates a recommended procedure that is required, if practical.
     1.4.3. ―May‖ indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.

                                    SUAS EVALUATORS

4.1. General. The evaluation portion of the SUAS Stan/Eval Program is administered by
SUAS-Es at MAJCOM and unit levels. SUAS-Es will use the evaluation criteria established in
AFI 11-5GP(1, 2, or 3)-SUAS volume 2 to conduct Qualification and EPEs SUAS-Es must be
certified and appointed in writing by the commander.. Exception: For flight test operations,
AFMC will establish training and certification criteria IAW AFI 11-5FT Vol 2.
4.2. Selection.

                                          Chapter 5

                                   SUAS EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The SUAS Stan/Eval Program utilizes three types of evaluations to ensure
qualification of SUAS-Os and standardization of operations: qualification, emergency
procedures, and supplementary. SUAS-O qualification evaluations are administered periodically
and documented on AF Form 8, Certification of Aircrew Qualification to ensure qualification.
EPEs are requisites for qualification evaluations. Supplementary evaluations are unstructured
tools to be used by the commander to ensure standardization of flying and other operations.
5.2. Qualification Evaluations. Qualification evaluations consist of two structured phases,
ground and flight. Each phase requires the completion of requisite tasks. The ground phase,
when required, includes a series of written examinations and evaluation of performance in a
controlled emergency procedures environment. The flight phase includes flight operations or, if
applicable, simulator evaluation of performance.
   5.2.1. Qualification Evaluation Categories. Periodic crew qualification (QUAL) are
   administered to ensure basic qualification in the UA and crew position of a SUAS-O.
   Evaluations are accomplished to ensure crew are certified and maintain instructor
   qualification (INSTR). Evaluation and certification of specific crew performance may also be
   accomplished (SPOT). Crew will complete the following types of certification evaluations as
   appropriate:
       5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. All operators will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in
       their primary assigned SUAS per the standards, to include requisites, as specified in the
       applicable UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2. The AF Form 8, Attachment 2, will indicate
       the applicable SUAS position, type(s), and category(ies). Positions are SUAS-O, Mission
       Operator (MO), Mission Commander (MC), Internal Operator (IO), External Operator
       (EO), Instructor, and Evaluator. QUAL evaluations after initial qualification will include
       qualification to employ the SUAS in accomplishing the unit’s operational mission
       (QUAL/MSN). Exception: AFMC – See AFI 11-5FT Vol 2 for AFMC evaluation
       criteria.
       5.2.1.2. MSN Evaluations. All SUAS-Os maintaining BAQ or MR status will complete a
       periodic MSN evaluation that includes evaluation in their primary assigned SUAS, to
       include requisites, as specified in the applicable UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2. The
       MSN portion should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required in the performance of
       normal operational and training sorties. The requirement for a MSN portion may be
       waived for those SUAS where performance of normal operational, test and training
       sorties involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of a basic QUAL evaluation as
       specified in UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2.
       5.2.1.3. Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations. SUAS-Os maintaining instructor qualification
       in a particular SUAS must complete initial and periodic evaluations of instructional
       capability in that SUAS. Instructors are evaluated to the standards contained in UAS
       Group-Specific Volume 2. Specialized, universal, or multiple qualification operators
       maintaining instructor qualification in multiple similar SUAS will accomplish initial and
       periodic evaluations as specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/ Group-Specific,
14                                                            AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012


     Volume 2. Exception: AFMC – See AFI 11-5FT Vol 2 for AFMC evaluation criteria for
     test operations.
        5.2.1.3.1. To initially qualify as an instructor in a particular SUAS, the member must
        successfully complete an initial instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation. Candidate
        SUAS-I must be qualified in all sub-areas they will instruct and are expected to meet
        the standards outlined in UAS Group-Specific Volume 2. Instructor candidates will
        be evaluated on instructor performance during a representative sample of maneuvers.
        Instructors should have a solid understanding of systems, procedures, and techniques.
        Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions whenever
        possible. When students are not available or mission requirements/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or, as a last resort,
        the evaluator may serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s
        instructional ability. Exception: AFMC – See AFI 11-5FT Vol 2 for AFMC
        evaluation criteria.
        5.2.1.3.2. Periodic evaluation of the ability of SUAS crew members to instruct will
        be conducted during all subsequent periodic evaluations. The AF Form 8
        Mission/Check description for these periodic evaluations will not include INSTR as
        the AF Form 8 aircraft/crew position is already annotated with highest qualification
        demonstrated during the previous evaluation.
        5.2.1.3.3. If instructor qualification is lost in a SUAS it may be regained through an
        instructor requalification evaluation IAW paragraph 5.2.2.2.6 or as directed in the
        UAS Group-Specific, Volume 1.
        5.2.1.3.4. QUAL, MSN and INSTRUCTOR evaluations can be combined whenever
        possible.
     5.2.1.4. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional). A SPOT evaluation is an
     administrative tool used by a commander to identify and evaluate implemented solutions
     to operational problems, and is not intended to satisfy the requirements of a periodic
     evaluation (e.g., QUAL/MSN or INSTR). SPOT evaluations have no specific requisites
     or requirements, unless specified in MAJCOM supplements. An evaluation that begins as
     a SPOT evaluation may become (and be documented as) a required periodic evaluation if
     all required flight phase requirements are completed during the SPOT evaluation and the
     examinee subsequently completes all ground phase requirements for the evaluation
     within the periods described in paragraph 5.2.6. Do not add on missions (flights) to
     complete the requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group/squadron
     commander concurs with the SUAS-O’s desire to realign the evaluation expiration date
     and approves the additional flight time requirements. Evaluations not listed in paragraphs
     5.2.1.1 and 5.2.1.2 will be documented as SPOT evaluations. Note: When the SUAS-E
     administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified in the same SUAS and same crew
     position of the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited towards a periodic
     evaluation.
  5.2.2. Qualification Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when
  applicable, to further describe the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1 - 5.2.1.3.
AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012                                                                      15


     5.2.2.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor
     qualification in an SUAS type (e.g., INIT QUAL, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.2.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency, a flight
     recheck following a failed periodic evaluation, or loss of qualification due to a
     commander-directed downgrade.
        5.2.2.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic
        evaluation, the evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic
        evaluation. The AF Form 8 description will be documented with an RQ prefix. Note:
        The AF Form 8 description will not be documented with an RQ prefix when
        expiration of a required periodic evaluation results in loss of qualification due to the
        individual’s failure to complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (paragraph
        5.2.3.). However, if the flight evaluation has been successfully completed within the
        eligibility period (paragraph 5.2.6.1.), or out-of-the-eligibility period (paragraph
        5.2.6.2.), the Group/CC may determine qualification will be re-established by
        completion of the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight
        evaluation or completed ground requisites (paragraph 5.2.15.).
        5.2.2.2.2. When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile
        will be as directed by the squadron commander and will include, as a minimum, those
        items for which the individual is non-current. The AF Form 8 description will be
        documented with RQ SPOT.
        5.2.2.2.3. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass a flight evaluation, the
        recheck evaluation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.2.12. The flight
        evaluation form description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as
        applicable.
        5.2.2.2.4. When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
        paragraph 7.3.), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the commander. The AF
        Form 8 description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as
        applicable.
        5.2.2.2.5. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
        qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
        5.2.2.2.6. When requalification deals with instructor capability, the flight evaluation
        form description will be documented with RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
     5.2.2.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified
     of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The
     beginning of normal preparation for a mission will be determined by the SUAS-E, no
     more than 24 hours prior, and may be further defined in supplements to this Instruction
     and as specified in UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2. The intent is to preclude
     extraordinary preparation for the mission.
        5.2.2.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
        daily SUAS-O performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
16                                                               AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012


         5.2.2.3.2. An examinee may utilize a no-notice evaluation to update a QUAL/MSN
         evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the evaluation are completed
         within the periods described in paragraph 5.2.6. If all requirements were not
         completed on the first flight, subsequent flights are authorized to complete required
         events. If the examinee elects not to update a QUAL/MSN evaluation expiration date,
         the evaluation will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
     5.2.2.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted in
     a simulator as specified in UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2. A SIM evaluation must
     include system set-up and tear down up to launch.
     5.2.2.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
     (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
     evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes will be explained under description on the
     AF Form 8.
  5.2.3. Ground Phase Requisites. The ground phase for periodic SUAS-O evaluations
  includes requisites listed below. See Chapter 6 of this Instruction for additional guidance on
  SUAS-O examinations.
     5.2.3.1. QUAL Evaluations. Written examination, Boldface/Critical Action Procedures
     (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable), and as specified in UAS Group-Specific,
     Volume 2. Scheduled periodic evaluations will be accomplished only after written
     examinations are completed.
  5.2.4. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for evaluations include execution in the
  SUAS type or a suitable simulator profile that will allow evaluation of SUAS-O
  performance. Flight evaluations conducted on a simulator require a waiver from the Using
  MAJCOM. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
  appropriate requirements set in the applicable UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2, and allow
  accurate measure of the proficiency of the examinee. Evaluation profiles will reflect unit
  tasking, daily training missions, be realistic, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the
  unit mission. Profile will typically include mission planning, execution, and debrief. If the
  assigned system is a multi-person operation, then the SUAS-O must perform the mission in
  all qualified positions, AFSOC/A3T determines the approval criteria for simulators and other
  SUAS crew training devices.
  5.2.5. Timing of SUAS-O Qualification Evaluations.
     5.2.5.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
     month in the timeframe specified by the AFI 11-5GP(1,2, or 3)-SUAS, Volume 2.
     5.2.5.2. Scheduling. Schedule periodic evaluations within the eligibility period (six-
     month period prior to expiration date).
     5.2.5.3. Extended Evaluations. Periodic evaluations may be extended on a case-by case
     basis according to the following criteria:
         5.2.5.3.1. Commanders may extend the expiration date of periodic evaluations up to
         three months for the reasons listed below.
             5.2.5.3.1.1. Individuals departing Permanent Change of Station / Permanent
             Change of Assignment (PCS/PCA) to a non-SUAS-O assignment.
AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012                                                                      17


             5.2.5.3.1.2. Individuals departing PCS or Temporary Duty (TDY) for retraining
             in another SUAS type.
             5.2.5.3.1.3. Individuals undergoing unit SUAS conversion.
             5.2.5.3.1.4. Individual removal from SUAS-O status (e.g. separation or
             retirement from the Service).
             5.2.5.3.1.5. Individuals participating in contingency operations (to include
             operations other than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required
             flight evaluation(s) before or during deployment. This will be on a case-by-case
             basis and is not authority to grant blanket extensions for scheduled operational
             deployments.
     5.2.5.4. Documentation. Document extensions with a Memorandum for Record (MFR)
     placed in the SUAS Training Folder / Flight Evaluation Folder (STF/FEF) specifying
     extension authority, the new expiration date, and include a brief description of the
     extension.
             5.2.5.4.1. Extension MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any
             affected periodic evaluation.
             5.2.5.4.2. File the MFR on top of the affected AF Form 8 in the STF/FEF.
             5.2.5.4.3. Requisites not completed during original eligibility period must be
             completed prior to extended expiration date indicated on the MFR.
             5.2.5.4.4. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected AF
             Form 8 under Remarks when action is complete and remove the MFR from the
             STF/FEF. Memos for record become a permanent part of the STF/FEF only when
             the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a
             later AF Form 8. Example: If an evaluation was extended based on an AFSOC
             waiver, an MFR will remain in the STF/FEF until such time as the next evaluation
             is completed. That waiver reference is commented on in Remarks of the AF Form
             8.
     5.2.5.5. Requirements Before Permanent Change of Station/Temporary Duty. If a
     periodic evaluation will expire within three months after the proposed departure for a
     PCS or during an upcoming TDY complete the required evaluation(s) before departing
     for either the PCS or the TDY. Obtain a MAJCOM Stan/Eval waiver for unusual
     situations.
  5.2.6. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements
  of combined evaluations as defined in UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2. Requisites from a
  completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations provided they cover all
  required areas and are within the requisite zone for each evaluation. Also see paragraph 5.3.1
  For all evaluations, accomplish requisites as follows:
     5.2.6.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in the
     eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the six-month eligibility period
     prior to the expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that expiration date.
18                                                              AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012


     5.2.6.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations outside the eligibility
     period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period encompassing the
     month in which the flight evaluation was administered. Exception: For extended
     evaluations, requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
     eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
     5.2.6.3. Recheck. For evaluations used to remedy a failed evaluation:
         5.2.6.3.1. Requisites valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.2.6.1 or 5.2.6.2
         remain valid, IAW paragraph 5.2.12.1.
         5.2.6.3.2. Requisite completion dates from the Q-3 AF Form 8 will not be annotated
         on the recheck AF Form 8. The recheck AF Form 8 will only include documentation
         of the flight phase evaluation.
  5.2.7. Alternate Means of Evaluation. When flight evaluation of a required area is not
  possible, the area may be evaluated in a simulator or verbally. SUAS-Es will make every
  effort to evaluate all required areas during flight operations before resorting to this option.
  See the appropriate UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2 for areas prohibited from
  simulator/verbal evaluation.
  5.2.8. Evaluation Criteria Source. AFSOC/A3, in coordination with using commands, will
  establish and maintain standardized INSTR, and QUAL/MSN evaluation criteria in the
  appropriate UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2.
  5.2.9. Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document
  SUAS-O performance. On one level, individual scores are recorded for examinations and
  areas/subareas of SUAS-O performance are individually graded against established
  evaluation criteria. Performance less than fully qualified is documented. On the second level,
  an overall qualification level is determined from the compilation of these individual
  scores/grades.
     5.2.9.1. Area/Subarea Grades. UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2 will establish areas and
     subareas to be evaluated during emergency procedure and other evaluations to include the
     appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas/subareas will have a two-level
     (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be documented against
     the listed subareas.
         5.2.9.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
         satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed SUAS-O duties within
         the prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
         5.2.9.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
         tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the SUAS-E or
         there were minor deviations from established standards that did not jeopardize
         mission accomplishment or flight safety.
         5.2.9.1.3. U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable
         parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely
         affected mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee
         receiving an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in
         the judgment of the SUAS-E, additional training will not constructively improve
AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012                                                                      19


        examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case, the SUAS-E must thoroughly
        debrief the examinee.
     5.2.9.2. Critical Area. AFSOC/A3 will establish evaluation areas that, upon failure,
     would adversely affect the qualification of a SUAS-O. Critical areas include, but are not
     limited to, Airmanship, Flight Discipline, Safety, and all emergency procedures. Grade
     all critical areas as either Qualified (Q) or Unqualified (U). Additional critical areas will
     be established in UAS group-specific Volume 2.
     5.2.9.3. Qualification Levels. EPEs and overall evaluation performance are graded by
     qualification levels as follows:
        5.2.9.3.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The SUAS-O demonstrated desired
        performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
        tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
        discrepancies were noted, and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
            5.2.9.3.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
            area(s)/subarea(s).
            5.2.9.3.1.2. In the judgment of the SUAS-E, none of the discrepancies preclude
            awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1.
            5.2.9.3.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during
            thedebriefing of that evaluation.
        5.2.9.3.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The SUAS-O demonstrated the ability to
        perform duties safely, but:
            5.2.9.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training
            was assigned.
            5.2.9.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
            5.2.9.3.2.3. In the judgment of the SUAS-E, there is justification based on
            performance in one or several areas/subareas.
        5.2.9.3.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The SUAS-O demonstrated an unacceptable
        level of safety, performance, or knowledge.
            5.2.9.3.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q-3
            for the evaluation. Note: Airmanship, Flight Discipline, and Safety are considered
            critical areas for all SUAS-Os. Additionally, all emergency procedures are
            considered critical. If one critical area is graded U, then the overall grade for the
            evaluation will be Q-3.
            5.2.9.3.3.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the SUAS-E,
            there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/subareas.
     5.2.9.4. Critical Emergency Procedures. Grade Boldface examinations as either
     Qualified (Q) or Unqualified (U).
     5.2.9.5. Examinations. Grade written, computer-based, or electronic examinations as a
     percentage of correct answers. See paragraph 6.4.3.1. for minimum passing grade criteria.
20                                                            AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012


  5.2.10. Grading Policies.
     5.2.10.1. Requisite Examinations. The SUAS-E will consider performance on requisite
     examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
     5.2.10.2. Performance Areas/Subareas. Use the two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U)
     grading system when applying the grading criteria definitions specified in the applicable
     UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2 to grade areas/subareas.
         5.2.10.2.1. The SUAS-E must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in the
         general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable UAS Group-Specific,
         Volume 2.
         5.2.10.2.2. The SUAS-E will grade any area/subarea observed during an evaluation if
         performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation accomplished or
         flight safety.
         5.2.10.2.3. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft
         conditions.
         5.2.10.2.4. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are
         acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such
         deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations when
         determining the overall area/subarea grade.
         5.2.10.2.5. The SUAS-E may further identify an area/sub-area as ―Commendable‖ if,
         in the examiner’s determination, the SUAS-O has demonstrated exceptional skill and
         knowledge in that particular area/sub-area. Document commendable areas in the
         examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form 8.
     5.2.10.3. Overall Qualification Levels.
         5.2.10.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded on an evaluation is based on
         performance during both the flight and ground phases. An overall grade of Q-1 or Q-
         2 will be awarded only after all evaluation requirements have been completed and
         given due consideration. An overall grade of Q-3 may be awarded at any time.
         5.2.10.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the SUAS-O must satisfy
         the criteria set forth in the applicable UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2 and
         demonstrate ability to operate the SUAS and/or equipment safely and effectively
         during all phases of an evaluation.
         5.2.10.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. While UAS
         roup-Specific, Volume 2 guidance may dictate the highest grade for a flight or EPE
         based on area and subarea performance, SUAS-E judgment will always be the
         determining factor in deciding the overall qualification level.
     5.2.10.4. Exceptionally Qualified Designation. An exceptionally qualified designation
     may be awarded by the SUAS-E. The designation can only be applied to the total
     evaluation - not to separate requisites. The designation may be awarded when:
         5.2.10.4.1. The SUAS-O has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in all
         phases of the evaluation;
AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012                                                                     21


         5.2.10.4.2. The SUAS-O has not failed any requisite and;
         5.2.10.4.3. The SUAS-O received a qualified grade with no remedial action on all
         areas/subareas evaluated during emergency procedures and flight evaluations.
  5.2.11. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy
  and/or deficiency in performance. Remedial action includes debriefing discrepancies and/or
  assignment of additional training. See paragraph 5.2.12. when discrepancies result in failure
  to pass a flight evaluation.
     5.2.11.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
     evaluation wherein the SUAS-E provides briefing/instruction concerning the discrepancy
     and determines the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to
     remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is annotated with
     ―Debriefed‖ in the Remarks section of the AF Form 8.
     5.2.11.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by a SUAS-E to remedy
     deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
         5.2.11.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, ground instruction, use of a
         simulator, or flying. To complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate
         attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
         5.2.11.2.2. Additional training is documented in Item(s) Requiring Additional
         Training on the AF Form 8. Description of assigned additional training will include
         how satisfactory knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to an evaluator or
         instructor.
         5.2.11.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be
         documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8.
         5.2.11.2.4. The evaluator or instructor who completed the additional training will
         sign and date verifying completion of all assigned training on the flight evaluation
         form in Item(s) Requiring Additional Training.
         5.2.11.2.5. Commanders will ensure required additional training is completed.
         Accomplish additional training by the last day of the third month following the date
         of the discrepancy, e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 06, additional training must be
         accomplished by 30 Apr 06. If an SUAS-O exceeds the allotted time for completion
         of additional training, the squadron commander will review the situation and direct
         appropriate action. Document the circumstances with an MFR placed in the STF/FEF
         of the affected individual. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the
         affected AF Form 8 under Remarks when action is complete, and remove the MFR
         from the STF/FEF. MFRs become a permanent part of the STF/FEF only when the
         major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later AF
         Form 8.
  5.2.12. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
     5.2.12.1. Recheck. If a SUAS-O fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
     recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
     e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 10, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 10. A recheck is
     successfully completed when the SUAS-O performs to Q criteria (Q or Q-/debriefed) for
22                                                              AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012


     each area graded U. Group/CCs may approve waivers to the time limits in this paragraph
     on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in the STF/FEF.
     Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8 under
     Remarks when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the STF/FEF. Memos for
     record become a permanent part of the STF/FEF only when the Major discrepancy
     addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later AF Form 8. Every
     reasonable effort must be made to requalify the individual. Commanders will determine
     the number of flights to be allowed during this period, based on the individual’s
     experience level, present qualifications and hours of training required. The SUAS-E that
     administered the original check will not normally administer the recheck.
     5.2.12.2. Status Downgrade. Downgrade a SUAS-O receiving a Q-3 QUAL/MSN
     evaluation to Unqualified status. For instructor evaluations, SUAS-O status need not be
     downgraded if the discrepancies were only in instructor areas.
  5.2.13. Restrictions. Substandard performance in any area/subarea may require restrictions
  to ensure operational safety or mission accomplishment. When called for by this Instruction
  or deemed necessary in the judgment of the SUAS-E, flight restrictions will be imposed on
  the examinee until successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
     5.2.13.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
     requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
     5.2.13.2. Specific restrictions and the criteria for their removal will be documented as the
     first item of the Form 8. Remarks: restrictions associated with failed requisite
     examinations will not be documented on the Form 8.
     5.2.13.3. Restrict a SUAS-O receiving a Q-3 on an evaluation until a successful
     evaluation is completed:
         5.2.13.3.1. For QUAL/MSN evaluations, place the examinee on supervised status in
         the SUAS in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the
         evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional SUAS. For a specialized
         qualified, universally qualified, or multiple qualified SUAS-O , UAS Group-Specific,
         Volume 2 may direct supervised status in all SUAS in which the individual maintains
         qualification.
  5.2.14. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance requires the SUAS-O be placed
  on supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
  determined by the squadron commander (or equivalent) and as specified in UAS Group-
  Specific, Volume 1. Supervision will be accomplished by instructors or designated
  supervisors (as specified in UAS Group-Specific, Volume 1) qualified in the specific SUAS.
  5.2.15. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If a SUAS-O
  fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the eligibility
  period, IAW paragraphs 5.2.6.1, or paragraph 5.2.6.2., the SUAS-O loses the qualification
  covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.2.13.3.1. apply. Qualification
  may be re-established by administering a requalification evaluation IAW paragraph 5.2.2.2.
  or by completion of the delinquent evaluation. Group/CCs may approve waivers to preclude
  the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the evaluation on a case-by-case
  basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in the STF/FEF. Incorporate the
AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012                                                                        23


   information contained in the MFR onto the affected flight evaluation form under Remarks
   when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the STF/FEF. Memos for record become
   a permanent part of the STF/FEF only when the major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is
   not addressed or corrected by a later flight evaluation form.
   5.2.16. Multiple Qualification. SUAS-O s may be required to maintain qualification in two
   or more distinctly different SUAS. Lead command may group SUAS with similar operating
   characteristics and control interfaces into a Family of Systems (FOS). Evaluation
   requirements will be specified in the Group-Specific Volume 2. Exception: AFMC will
   define evaluation requirements for test operations.
      5.2.16.1. Qualification/Mission Evaluations. SUAS-Os require a QUAL evaluation, or, if
      applicable, a QUAL/MSN evaluation IAW the appropriate UAS Group-Specific, Volume
      2.
      5.2.16.2. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A downgrade resulting from a Q-3 in
      QUAL/MSN evaluation applies only to the SUAS for which the evaluation was
      administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to
      additional SUAS.
   5.2.17. SUAS-Os Flying Non-US Air Force SUAS or with Non-US Air Force
   Units. SUAS-Os authorized to perform duties using non-US Air Force SUAS, or assigned or
   attached to non-US Air Force units for SUAS operations will comply with host service,
   contractor/manufacturer, or host country guidance, except for the requirement to maintain a
   current physical. They do not necessarily comply with USAF guidance, including this
   volume and UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF units,
   they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF evaluations
   that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.2.13 of this Instruction apply to
   such individuals until successful evaluations are completed. Notes: 1. MAJCOMs may
   approve exceptions to requirements for returning SUAS-Os to complete applicable requisites
   and expired USAF evaluations, if, after case-by-case review, they determine non-USAF
   evaluations are equivalent to applicable UAS Group-Specific, Volume 2 evaluations.
   Document such action with an MFR placed in the STF/FEF on top of the non-USAF flight
   evaluation form equivalent. 2. Air Force units that use non-US Air Force SUAS to execute
   an Air Force flyingprogram will comply with current Air Force guidance, unless exempted
   by properauthority.
5.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE).
   5.3.1. Scope. Evaluate a SUAS-O’s knowledge of UAS Group-Specific emergency
   procedures and systems knowledge for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission specific
   emergency procedures and systems knowledge during QUAL/MSN evaluations. A single
   EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g., a QUAL/MSN and INSTR evaluation). The
   combined EPE must be of a scope and duration to cover required areas and must be within
   the requisite zone for each evaluation.
   5.3.2. Satisfactory Performance. Satisfactory performance for EPEs requires taking the
   proper action in the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each SUAS-O is responsible
   for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their SUAS position.
 24                                                               AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012


   5.3.3. Content and Administration. All SUAS-Os are responsible for understanding and
   applying proper emergency action procedures applicable to their crew position. Group-
   Specific Volume 2 will specify contents of EPEs, grading areas to be evaluated, grading
   criteria and whether EPEs may be done during flight, in a simulator, or verbally.
   5.3.4. Grading. The SUAS-E will assign an EPE grade 1, 2, or 3 (Qualification Level 1, 2,
   or 3) in the Requisite Testing block of the flight evaluation form, regardless of whether all or
   a portion of the EPE was performed during flight.
   5.3.5. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the SUAS-E will
   indicate if the additional training will be accomplished before next flight under restrictions in
   the Remarks block of the flight evaluation form.
   5.3.6. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP situation during
   an EPE requires an unqualified (3) EPE grade. A SUAS-O who receives a 3 grade as a result
   of Boldface/CAPs error will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
   5.3.7. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an unqualified EPE grade (3) will be
   placed on supervised status until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
5.4. Supplementary Evaluations. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by
a commander to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to operational problems. These
evaluations are most often administered as inspections (using specifically prepared checklists)
where results are reported to the commander. The form and content of supplementary evaluations
is at the discretion of the commander.
   5.4.1. Supplementary evaluations are not SUAS-O qualification evaluations.
   5.4.2. Commanders will determine evaluated areas. The Stan/Eval function will determine
   the method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative management of data collection,
   and will report results as directed by the commander.
   5.4.3. Individuals other than SUAS-Es, as determined by the Group/CC, may conduct
   supplementary evaluations.
   5.4.4. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
   evaluation. If conducted during flight operations, supplementary evaluations should not be all
   encompassing, nor result in the assignment of an overall rating for any specific crew
   member, nor be documented on a flight evaluation form.
   5.4.5. Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes.
5.5. SUAS-E Evaluation Requirements. The SUAS-E position is a certification, not a
qualification. Refer to MAJCOM supplements to this volume for specific guidance.
   5.5.1. SUAS-E must meet the same criteria as instructors. Additionally, they must have
   expert knowledge of all applicable instructions and should set exemplary standards during
   evaluations.
   5.5.2. SUAS-E will be trained and certified IAW this volume (including MAJCOM
   supplement). SUAS-E must be instructor qualified in a given event prior to acting as an
   evaluator in that event. Certified evaluators who subsequently add special mission instructor
   or other instructor qualifications are automatically certified to evaluate these new
   qualifications.
AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012                                                                    25


                                          Chapter 6

                           SUAS-O EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The SUAS-O examination program measures SUAS-O knowledge of normal and
emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned UAS through the administration of written, computer-based or
electronic examinations. Poor testing performance on examinations indicates areas requiring
increased training emphasis.
6.2. Scope. The examination program in this chapter includes requisite examinations for
periodic evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite examinations include
qualification written examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in paragraph
5.2.3.1. The ability to focus on specific knowledge areas is enhanced by the management of
examination content and use of appropriate MQFs.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will describe the unit SUAS-O examination
   program in the unit supplement to this Instruction.
   6.3.2. Computer-Based or Electronic Examinations. Computer based or electronic
   information management tools may fulfill the requirement for examinations as outlined in
   this Instruction.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. The Stan/Eval function will retain graded exam
   answer sheets/computer records until the flight evaluation form is completed.
   6.3.4. Examination Question Review. The Stan/Eval function will review all MQFs,
   secure question banks, and prepared exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in
   source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a source document change
       it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document their procedures for
   reviewing and updating MQFs and preparing exams in their unit supplement to this
   Instruction.
6.4. Requisite Examinations. SUAS-Os will complete written and Boldface/CAPs
examinations (if applicable) as requisites for periodic QUAL evaluations (see paragraph 5.2.3.),
and any other examinations required by the appropriate AFI 11-5GP(1,2, or 3)-SUAS Volume 2.
   6.4.1. Requisite Examination Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs
   examinations, maintain either requisite examinations for each SUAS position or generate a
   unique test for each SUAS-O requiring an exam.
       6.4.1.1. If requisite examinations are maintained for each SUAS position:
           6.4.1.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two requisite
           examinations for each crew position.
           6.4.1.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per SUAS position require only one
           examination.
           6.4.1.1.3. When different SUAS positions are responsible for the same information,
           units are not required to maintain separate examinations for each crew position.
26                                                            AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012


         6.4.1.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on requisite
         examinations each calendar year.
     6.4.1.2. If a unique test is generated for each SUAS-O requiring an exam:
         6.4.1.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for test creation.
         6.4.1.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain a sufficient number of questions to
         ensure a probability of no more than 50 percent duplication of questions for each test
         generated.
  6.4.2. Examination Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all
  requisite exams, applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media.
  6.4.3. Grading Policy for Examinations.
     6.4.3.1. Minimum Passing Grade. The minimum passing grade for Boldface/CAPs
     exams is 100 percent. The minimum passing grade for all other Stan/Eval requisite
     examinations is 85 percent - corrected to 100 percent.
     6.4.3.2. Requisite and Boldface/CAPs Examination Grading Restriction. Units will grade
     all completed requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the SUAS-O’s next flight.
     Units will describe how this restriction is enforced in the unit supplement to this
     Instruction.
  6.4.4. Examination Question Sources.
     6.4.4.1. Written Exam. Exam will consist of at least 25 questions. Questions will come
     from MQFs. These questions will emphasize system knowledge and information
     necessary for safe flight and mission accomplishment. A minimum of 5 questions will be
     on airspace control measures and coordination procedures.
         6.4.4.1.1. UAS Group-Specific MQFs. MAJCOMs will ensure UAS Group-Specific
         MQFs containing approved questions for testing are available for use and distribution
         to applicable SUAS-Os.
         6.4.4.1.2. The highest level organization with a SUAS Stan/Eval function will
         develop, maintain and publish MQFs. That organization will submit these MQFs to
         MAJCOM/A3 for approval prior to their publication.
         6.4.4.1.3. AFSOC/A3OU will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to
         MQFs as necessary. Units may supplement MQFs to accommodate local testing
         procedures, administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or
         operational procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
  6.4.5. Boldface/CAPs Requisite Examinations.
     6.4.5.1. SUAS-O knowledge of applicable Boldface/CAPs will be evaluated through a
     written examination as a requisite to all periodic QUAL evaluations.
     6.4.5.2. Satisfactory performance for the Boldface/CAPs examination requires writing
     the proper actions in the correct sequence, not necessarily a verbatim response. The
     SUAS-E will assign a Boldface/CAPs grade (Q or U) on the flight evaluation form.
AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012                                                                       27


   6.4.6. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. An evaluation will not be complete until all
   failed items have been successfully re-accomplished.
       6.4.6.1. Reexamination Policy. SUAS-Os failing a requisite examination at any time
       must be afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than
       Boldface/CAPs, the SUAS-O will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
       6.4.6.2. Reexamination Period. SUAS-Os who fail a requisite examination mustcomplete
       a successful reexamination by the end of the third month following the date of the first
       failure, or the end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to
       extend the time allowed to successfully complete the examination is the Group/CC.
       Document such waivers with an MFR placed in the STF/FEF of the affected individual.
       Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected flight evaluation
       form under remarks when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the STF/FEF.
       Memos for record become a permanent part of the STF/FEF only when the Major
       discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later flight
       evaluation form.
       6.4.6.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. SUAS-Os failing a Boldface/CAPs
       exam will not control a SUAS until a successful reexamination is accomplished.
       6.4.6.4. Supervised Status Requirement. Place SUAS-Os who fail a requisite open book
       or closed book examination in supervised status until successful retesting is completed.
       For SUAS-Os who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status resulting from
       failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the SUAS for which
       the examination was administered.
6.5. Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may
conduct periodic testing for all SUAS-Os. The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional
knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge,
tactical/threat knowledge, and/or operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge
deficiencies exist within the unit. This exam may be open or closed book, but will not count as a
requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy the requirement for a periodic exam. Units will
describe this program in the unit supplement to this Instruction, to include procedures for failed
exams.
 28                                                               AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012


                                           Chapter 7

                                     DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the SUAS-O Standardization and Evaluation program requires
accurate documentation. The qualifications and authorizations to which SUAS-O/I/Es are to be
evaluated are determined by the unit certification document. The results of an evaluation are
recorded on AF Form 8 (see Attachment 2), which then serve to certify the qualification of the
SUAS-O/I/E. The chronological history of evaluations for a crewmember is recorded on AF
Form 942, Record of Evaluation. Additional use of AF Form 623, Individual Training Record
Folder or MAJCOM-approved STF/FEFs is at MAJCOM discretion. Exception: AFMC may
prescribe appropriate forms for test missions.
7.2. Qualifications and Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on AF Form 8, as applicable. Certifications attained through methods other than
evaluation (instructor-certified events and commander certifications) may be documented on a
MAJCOM-approved unit certification document signed by an authorized official and filed in the
STF/FEF.
7.3. Commander-Directed Downgrade.
   7.3.1. Purpose. Any commander in the SUAS-O’s chain of command may direct a
   downgrade to an intermediate level of qualification/certification or unqualified/decertified
   status without administering an evaluation under the following guidance:
       7.3.1.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only, e.g., breach of flying discipline or
       flight safety, including incidents not observed by an examiner, or observed by an
       examiner of another crew specialty.
       7.3.1.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
       administrative or judicial actions. Use in cases where such actions directly affect the
       commander’s confidence in the SUAS-O’s flying or performance ability to safely operate
       the SUAS and/or equipment.
       7.3.1.3. For a Commander-Directed Downgrade AF Form 8, only the commander signs
       as the Final Approving Officer. See paragraph 7.6.1.
7.4. Decertification. Decertification events fall into two categories: Decertification for Cause
(with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
   7.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
       7.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade, but
       also apples to commander-directed decertification of SUAS-Es (resulting from
       substandard performance).
       7.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, on the certification document line out
       the event, date and certifying official/organization/location; annotate ―Decertification for
       Cause‖ under Subject Title; enter date of decertification under Date Certified; enter
       name, rank, organization, and office symbol and signature of decertifying official under
       Certification Official/Organization.
AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012                                                                       29


   7.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on performance.
       7.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification occurs
       that will not be regained IAW UAS Group-Specific Volume 1, when instructor-certified
       events become core mission events, or when a higher certification is obtained making the
       previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for SUAS-Es as a
       result of reasons other than substandard performance.
       7.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification: on the certification document line
       out the event, date and certifying official/organization/location; annotate ―Discretionary
       Decertification‖ under Subject Title; enter date of decertification under Date Certified;
       enter name, rank, organization and office symbol of the decertifying official under
       Certification Official/Organization. Note: For decertification due to loss of currency with
       no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of decertification will be the date
       the SUAS-O went noncurrent.
       7.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only no action is necessary. If desired for
       clarity: line out the event, date and certifying official/ organization/location; annotate
       ―Renamed (new name)‖ under Subject Title.
       7.4.2.4. For members who change SUAS type while assigned/attached to the same
       Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new certification document indicating the new SUAS
       type and transcribe all events which apply to the new SUAS type.
7.5. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.5.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8 to record crew qualification. AF Form 8 certification is
   accomplished by four individuals, beginning with the Flight Examiner, who completes the
   evaluation by signing the AF Form 8. Next, the Reviewing Officer and Final Approving
   Officer review the contents, the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all required
   additional training was adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete, and sign
   the AF Form 8. The final signature is provided by the examinee, who will sign the completed
   AF Form 8.
       7.5.1.1. Use a separate AF Form 8 for all flight phase rechecks.
       7.5.1.2. Ground rechecks will be completed on the original Q-3 AF Form 8 (see
       paragraph 7.5.9.).
   7.5.2. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 8.
   See Attachment 2 for sample AF Form 8.
       7.5.2.1. For date fields in the AF Form 8 use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-
       digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by the form.
       7.5.2.2. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification will use a three-letter
       month and two-digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by
       the form.
       7.5.2.3. Except for the organization of the Comments block described in paragraph
       7.5.7., sample AF Forms 8 are provided to demonstrate the content, not the format, of the
       data presented (see Attachment 2).
30                                                            AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012


     7.5.2.4. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except where specifically noted
     otherwise, use upper and lower case letters.
     7.5.2.5. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification
     (right, left or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct
     specific format standards for such data entry.
  7.5.3. Date Completed.
     7.5.3.1. Use the latest completion date (ground or flight phase) of the evaluation
     requisites or the additional training. Use this date on the AF Form 942, Record of
     Evaluation as well.
  7.5.4. - Examinee Identification.
     7.5.4.1. Name, Rank (abbreviated or non-abbreviated rank format is acceptable) and
     Social Security Account Number (SSAN). Note: Use of last four of SSAN is approved.
     7.5.4.2. Organization and Location.
         7.5.4.2.1. Enter unit designation and location where the examinee is assigned or
         attached for flying.
         7.5.4.2.2. For FTU courses in which an evaluation is administered, the organization
         and location will reflect the FTU organization/location.
     7.5.4.3. Aircraft/Crew Position.
         7.5.4.3.1. Enter the SUAS type and crew position in which the evaluation was given.
         7.5.4.3.2. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
         evaluation as directed in the Group-Specific Volume 2.
     7.5.4.4. Eligibility Period.
         7.5.4.4.1. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last
         similar periodic aircrew qualification evaluation (e.g., if the last MSN evaluation
         expires in Sep 09, enter Apr-Sep 09).
         7.5.4.4.2. Enter N/A (not applicable) for initial periodic aircrew qualification
         evaluations, SPOT evaluations, and requalification (RQ) evaluations.
         7.5.4.4.3. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if
         last QUAL evaluation expires Nov 09 and MSN evaluation expires Jan 10, enter
         ―QUAL: Jun-Nov 09/MSN: Aug 09-Jan 10‖ for a QUAL/MSN evaluation).
         7.5.4.4.4. For periodic evaluations where the evaluation expiration date of the
         previous evaluation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.2.6., enter the 6-
         month period preceding the original expiration date. Note: Squadron commanders
         extend only the expiration date, not the eligibility period.
  7.5.5. - Qualification.
     7.5.5.1. Ground Phase.
         7.5.5.1.1. Examination/Check.
            7.5.5.1.1.1. Make       a   separate   entry    for    each    ground     requisite
AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012                                                                     31


            examination/evaluation. Discrepancies will be noted in the examiner’s remarks.
            7.5.5.1.1.2. If requisites exceed available lines, make combined entries or
            document additional requisite completion in the Comments section.
            7.5.5.1.1.3. Annotate ―Boldface‖ or ―CAPs‖ as required by the applicable UAS
            Group-Specific, Volume 2.
        7.5.5.1.2. Date. In the date column, enter the date that the requisite is successfully
        completed.
        7.5.5.1.3. Grade.
            7.5.5.1.3.1. Enter failed examination score with successfully completed score as
            follows: 84/98.
            7.5.5.1.3.2. Enter failed Boldface/CAPs with successful re-accomplishment as
            follows: U/ Q.
            7.5.5.1.3.3. Separate Boldface/CAPs grades from other requisite examination
            grades when on the same line by enclosing them in parentheses as follows: 84/98
            (U/Q).
            7.5.5.1.3.4. Enter failed EPE grades with a successful recheck as follows: 3/1.
     7.5.5.2. Flight Phase.
        7.5.5.2.1. Mission/Check.
            7.5.5.2.1.1. Use the following designations to describe the purpose of the
            evaluation(s): QUAL, MSN, and SPOT.
            7.5.5.2.1.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
            evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and SIM. More than one prefix may be used to
            describe an evaluation.
            7.5.5.2.1.3. Make a single line entry to document the flight(s)/event(s) used to
            complete the evaluation.
            7.5.5.2.1.4. Make multiple single line entries for each flight/event if two or more

8.2. Flight-Related Commander’s Interest Item (CII) .
   8.2.1. Flight-related CIIs are items of emphasis of existing procedure(s) designed to mitigate
   or eliminate specific risks or trends. CIIs do not add to or amend established procedures. CIIs
   will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to include Safety
   Investigation Board (SIB) findings/recommendations, safety related incidences, trend
   analysis, deployed area of operations and potential problems with equipment/procedures.
   8.2.2. CII(s) should normally be of limited duration (i.e. not to exceed 90 days) so as to
   maintain the focus. If the situation for which the CII was issued remains, consideration
   should be given to amending current procedures and issuing corrective action via a command
   message or FCIF.
   8.2.3. CII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the MAJCOM, NAF or unit level.
AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012                                                                      43


   8.2.4. MAJCOM/NAF CII(s) will be issued to applicable unit Group Stan/Eval sections in a
   message format identifying the following elements: subject/title, unique DTG, UAS group-
   specific applicability, references (document, SIB, etc) risk and trend details, specific
   emphasis actions to reduce/eliminate the risk or trend that is the CII topic, effective date of
   recession, and SME/POC for further information.
   8.2.5. Units will place all MAJCOM/NAF issued CIIs into the FCIF, Current Read File, Part
   B, for dissemination to crewmembers.
   8.2.6. All current flight-related UAS Group-Specific and CRM/ORM related CII(s) will be
   briefed during flight briefings for the duration of the CII(s). Flight-related CII(s) need only
   be briefed on those missions for which the CII is relevant.
   8.2.7. Current MAJCOM/NAF and unit issued CII(s) will be identified in Flight Crew
   Information Summary (FCIS) attachments. Units that do not publish a FCIS will maintain
   current CII(s) in Part B of their FCIF until rescinded.
8.3. Go/No-Go Procedures. Units will establish a positive control system that ensures SUAS-
Os have completed all ground training and Stan/Eval items required for flight.
   8.3.1. As a minimum, the Go/No-Go system will monitor:
       8.3.1.1. The training items from AFI 11-5 Group-Specific SUAS, Volume 1, required for
       flight.
       8.3.1.2. The ground training items required for flight from the applicable 11-5 Group-
       Specific SUAS, Volume 1.
       8.3.1.3. SUAS-O physical examination, IAW AFI 48-123, Medical              Examinations
       and Standards.
       8.3.1.4. The Stan/Eval examination items required for flight from AFI 11-5Group
       Specific-SUAS, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement.
       8.3.1.5. Any SUAS-O Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status.
       8.3.1.6. Currency on all FCIF (FCIF Volume 1, Part B and C (Note: Part C is optional))
       items.
   8.3.2. Each unit will define a positive control system and publish the procedure in the unit
   supplement to this Instruction. Consider both garrison and field duty locations.
8.4. Electronic Data Storage. Units will use the approved Web application (SUASMAN) for
record keeping, trend analysis, printing of standard forms, etc. Exception: AFMC is not required
to utilize SUASMAN.
8.5. Instructor Certified Events. These are events that require certification of training by an
instructor or examiner. Document certification in the approved SUAS web application (e.g.
SUASMAN). Exception: AFMC is not required to utilize SUASMAN. Additional use of AF
Form 623 or MAJCOM approved STF/FEFs is at MAJCOM discretion. The squadron
commander, Stan/Eval assigned personnel, or the instructor completing the training will sign the
form.
8.6. Stan/Eval Board (SEB). Group commanders will chair a semi-annual SEB. As a
minimum, Primary SUAS-Es and Primary SUAS-Is will attend. Attachment 6 identifies the
 44                                                             AFI11-502V2 26 APRIL 2012


format for the SEB minutes. The Primary SUAS-E will coordinate the schedule, agenda, and
attendees for the semi-annual SEB. The resulting SEB minutes will be sent to the appropriate
Group, MAJCOM and HQ AFSOC/A3OU no later than 30 days after the conclusion of the SEB.
Formal SEB requirements may be waived by the MAJCOM when unit tasking impacts the
conduct of the unit’s SEB. Notify AFSOC/A3OU if an SEB will not be held at the required
interval. Groups will consolidate unit SEB minutes to validate Group-wide trends, if applicable.
8.7. Trend Analysis Program. Stan/Eval organizations at the Group and Squadron level will
establish a Trends Analysis Program. Group and Squadron commanders are the final authority
for establishing their unit’s trends.
   8.7.1. The Group/Squadron will establish specific trend analysis threshold percentages and
   procedures. The Trend Analysis Program will include an objective analysis of all SUAS-O
   evaluations, written examinations, and SUAS operations during exercises and contingencies.
   Group and unit Chief of Stan/Eval will report both positive and negative trend data,
   recommend corrective actions, assign an OPR/OCR, and report the status to the SEB.
   8.7.2. After identification of a trend, each unit will provide increased training emphasis on
   that trend for at least two consecutive quarters.
   8.7.3. The report information will be included in the minutes and follow-up actions will be
   addressed at the subsequent SEBs until the discrepancies are closed. The Chief of Stan/Eval
   must maintain the trend analysis data for a minimum of one year.
       8.7.3.1. For ground phase test consider the validity of the question, and the need for
       and/or appropriateness of increased emphasis in the question’s subject area.
       8.7.3.2. For flight phase evaluation, calculate the percentage of Q-1, Q-2 and Q-3 grades
       against the total number of evaluations given in the sub-area. Trends are not always
       identified by a threshold percentage, but may be determined by the commander’s
       assessment as a potential weakness area.
       8.7.3.3. For SUAS trends, calculate the percentage of loss-of-link (LOL), GPS signal
       loss, and specific damages against the total number of flight hours/sorties flown.
       Additionally compile and submit all mishap reports. Trends are not always identified by a
       threshold percentage, but may be determined by the commander’s assessment as a
       potential weakness area.
