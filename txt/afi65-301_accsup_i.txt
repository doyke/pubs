                                            Chapter 1

                                       AUDIT REPORTS

1.1. Overview. The Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA) is the sole provider of internal audit
services to the Air Force, and a report is the usual product of an AFAA audit. This chapter
provides information on processing AFAA audit reports and tracking the implementation of
report recommendations. Attachment 3 identifies report processing responsibilities. In addition,
public accountants audit nonappropriated fund (NAF) activities and issue reports following
policy in AFPD 65-3. Chapter 5 contains information on public accountant audits and reports of
NAF activities.
1.2. Audit Process. AFAA uses an audit process that attempts to make the most efficient and
effective use of audit resources. Prior to announcing an audit, AFAA conducts substantial
preliminary research to identify appropriate audit subjects that AFAA includes in a plan it
provides to management annually. The process permits flexibility and timely adjustment of audit
requirements due to changes in Air Force policy and emphasis.
     1.2.1. Audit Phases. Each audit consists of three phases: research, application, and report
     processing. The research phase encompasses all actions needed to define audit objectives
     and thoroughly plan the audit. The research phase culminates with development of the audit
     program which provides the analytical methodology for a thorough examination designed to
     disclose deficiencies and their underlying causes and impact. During the application phase,
     auditors gather adequate evidence to support audit results and provide a basis for specific
     recommendations. At the conclusion of field work, the AFAA prepares a draft report that
     presents identified audit results and recommendations so management can take appropriate
     corrective actions without the need for further review or study. AFAA releases the draft
     report to management for formal comments. After receiving the management comments,
     AFAA adds them to the final report, along with an AFAA evaluation, and distributes the
     final report. Designated activities formally track the final report until management indicates
     it has implemented all the agreed-to actions. Follow-up audits determine whether actions
     taken by management corrected cited deficiencies.
     1.2.2. Deconflicting Audits. Before starting each audit, AFAA first determines if conducting
     the audit would adversely affect the units involved. AFAA will defer the audit start or select
     other locations when the unit is experiencing significant operational demands (i.e.,
     deployments, exercises, or inspections) and conducting the audit would conflict with the
     unusual workload demands. Deconflicting audits is accomplished through coordination
     between AFAA and the base, major command (MAJCOM), field operating agency (FOA),
     direct reporting unit (DRU), and Air National Guard (ANG) management. NOTE:
     Throughout the remainder of this instruction, MAJCOM is used as a collective term to
     denote “MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and ANG.”
     1.2.3. Audit Limitation. Internal audits do not criticize responsible management decisions.
     Most management decisions involve some degree of risk and uncertainty. Even when later
     events show the wrong decision was made, this, by itself, does not mandate an audit report.
     Unsuccessful decisions become subject to audit when they result in inefficient operations,
AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                             5


  inadequate procedures, or other deficiencies and when reporting them would lead to
  improving systems, procedures, or avoiding future errors.
  1.2.4. (Added-ACC) Management Responsibilities.
     1.2.4.1. (Added-ACC) Management at all levels must stay abreast of audit activity in
     their area and work directly with the auditors during audit application and
     discussion/validation of draft reports of audit (ROAs). If an area of disagreement arises,
     the auditor will be advised and every effort must be made to resolve the issue before the
     draft ROA is issued for formal management comments. Unit managers should bring
     disagreements to the attention of their Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC)
     counterpart to ensure unit position is in line with HQ ACC policy and procedures. HQ
     ACC functionals should likewise contact their Air Staff counterpart.
        1.2.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) Corrective action should be taken prior to completion of
        audit whenever possible and the auditor notified accordingly.
        1.2.4.1.2. (Added-ACC) The senior officer responsible for the audited activity (or
        designated representative), audit focal point, and functional experts should attend the
        audit out-brief.
     1.2.4.2. (Added-ACC) Establishment of Focal Points. A focal point will be appointed
     at each level of management to monitor audit activity and assist AFAA in the processing
     of draft ROAs (establish procedures, establish and monitor suspenses, review format and
     content, etc.) and other audit related correspondence. The focal point should play an
     active role in the audit process and in resolving disagreements between management and
     auditors.
        1.2.4.2.1. (Added-ACC) HQ ACC Focal Point. The ACC Comptroller (HQ
        ACC/FM) is the central focal point within ACC for all audit matters relating to
        AFAA. The ACC Audit Liaison and Follow-up Section (HQ ACC/FMPPM) acts for
        HQ ACC/FM in this regard. Duties include:
            1.2.4.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) Develop and implement a program for processing
            ROAs and monitoring AFAA activity.
            1.2.4.2.1.2. (Added-ACC) Receive and review all ROAs and related
            correspondence and initiate the resolution process when reports contain
            disagreements.
            1.2.4.2.1.3. (Added-ACC) Establish and maintain command’s formal audit
            follow-up files/records in order to comply with follow-up reporting requirements
            (AFI 65-403, Followup on Internal Air Force Audit Reports).
            1.2.4.2.1.4. (Added-ACC) Determine staff office of primary responsibility
            (OPR) and office of collateral responsibility (OCR) when appropriate and provide
            copies of ROAs and related correspondence to the staff focal point for these
            offices.
            1.2.4.2.1.5. (Added-ACC) Ensure staff focal points are aware of ROA review
            procedures, including suspense time frames.
            1.2.4.2.1.6. (Added-ACC) Coordinate between the AFAA representative to HQ
6                                             AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


       ACC and the ACC staff on ROA requirements clarification, interpretations or
       resolution.
       1.2.4.2.1.7. (Added-ACC) Promote cooperation between ACC and AFAA
       personnel.
       1.2.4.2.1.8. (Added-ACC) Act as staff focal point for HQ ACC/FM.
    1.2.4.2.2. (Added-ACC) HQ ACC Staff Focal Points. Each ACC directorate and
    special staff agency (SSA) will appoint by letter, a primary and alternate focal point
    for AFAA activity. Appointment letters will be submitted to HQ ACC/FM and will
    include designees’ name, rank, office symbol, building/room number,
    telephone/telefax numbers (DSN and commercial), and e-mail address. Appointment
    letters will be updated as changes occur. Throughout the remainder of this
    supplement, ACC staff focal point is used as a collective term to denote ACC
    directorate and SSA focal points. ACC staff focal points will:
       1.2.4.2.2.1. (Added-ACC) Develop a program for processing reports,
       monitoring AFAA activity and keeping their director/SSA chief/commander and
       staff informed of AFAA matters.
       1.2.4.2.2.2. (Added-ACC) Receive, review, and process all ROAs and related
       correspondence designating functional OPR and OCRs as needed.
       1.2.4.2.2.3. (Added-ACC) Act as the command project officer for audits which
       their organization (directorate and SSA) has been identified as OPR/OCR. If
       focal point will not be acting as the project officer for a specific audit, they will
       ensure that HQ ACC/FMPPM is notified in writing of the name, grade, office
       symbol, telephone numbers, and e-mail address of the individual assuming project
       officer duties. The ACC staff focal point will also ensure that the project officer
       is familiar with the requirements of AFI 65-301 and AFI 65-403.
       1.2.4.2.2.4. (Added-ACC) Advise and assist functional offices in preparing
       ROA responses and other related correspondence.
       1.2.4.2.2.5. (Added-ACC) Maintain files on all AFAA audits involving
       activities within their organization’s purview.
    1.2.4.2.3. (Added-ACC) Headquarters Numbered Air Force (HQ NAF) Focal Point.
    The HQ NAF Comptroller (or senior budget analyst) is designated the focal point for
    AFAA activity. Focal point will designate an alternate and provide appointment
    letters per paragraph 1.2.4.2.4.1 of this supplement. HQ NAF focal point is
    responsible for developing a program for monitoring AFAA activity, from
    announcement to final report; processing related audit correspondence including
    requests for management comments and final reports; and keeping the commander
    informed of audit work within the HQ NAF staff.
    1.2.4.2.4. (Added-ACC) Subordinate Unit Focal Points. ACC wing-level host base
    comptrollers are designated the focal point for AFAA activity at the host unit and all
    ACC tenant organizations. ACC tenant unit comptrollers on non-ACC bases are
    designated the focal point for AFAA activity. ACC tenant unit commanders without

           a comptroller function and located on a non-ACC base must appoint an individual to
           serve in this capacity. Focal points will designate an alternate.
               1.2.4.2.4.1. (Added-ACC) Focal points will advise HQ ACC/FM and servicing
               AFAA audit office in writing of the primary and alternate designees’ name, rank,
               official mailing address, telephone (DSN and commercial) and telefax numbers,
               and e-mail. Appointment letters may be signed by the comptroller and should be
               updated as changes occur.
               1.2.4.2.4.2. (Added-ACC) Focal points will develop a program for monitoring
               AFAA activity, from announcement to final report; processing related audit
               correspondence including requests for management comments and final reports;
               and keeping their commander informed of AFAA activity.
1.3. Types of Reports.
   1.3.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA Air Force-level audit reports are the result of
   centrally managed, single or multi-site, audits that the AFAA addresses to the Secretariat, Air
   Staff, or MAJCOM. AFAA also provides these reports to the Assistant Secretary for
   Financial Management and Comptroller (SAF/FM) for tracking recommendations and to the
   Department of Defense Inspector General (DoDIG) for information. The AFAA issues two
   types of Air Force-level reports: standard and interim.
       1.3.1.1. Standard Report. The standard report (also known as a “blue book”) represents
       the normal reporting vehicle for conveying the results of Air Force-wide audits.
       1.3.1.2. Interim Report. AFAA issues interim reports (a) when audit results require
       prompt management attention and timeliness is critical (quick-reaction) or (b) to convey
       the audit status for a lengthy audit (preliminary). The interim report provides
       management an opportunity to initiate early corrective actions on identified findings and
       for AFAA to acknowledge those actions in the audit report.
   1.3.2. Installation-Level Reports. AFAA installation-level audit reports usually result from
   single-site audits covering issues specific to an activity or installation. The AFAA issues
   three types of installation-level reports: regular and interim.
       1.3.2.1. Regular Report. The regular report is the most commonly issued installation-
       level report. AFAA area audit offices use regular reports to convey the results of
       installation-level audits.
       1.3.2.2. Interim Report. AFAA area audit offices issue interim reports for the reasons
       cited in paragraph 1.3.1.2.
1.4. Draft Report Processing. The AFAA sends draft reports to tenant, installation, MAJCOM,
Air Staff, or Secretariat officials, as appropriate, for comments. Attachment 3 provides a list of
responsibilities for processing draft Air Force-level reports.
   1.4.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA simultaneously distributes draft reports to the
   Secretariat, Air Staff, or MAJCOM office of primary responsibility (OPR) and applicable
   offices of collateral responsibility (OCRs).
       1.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) If audit work was conducted at HQ ACC or ACC subordinate or
       gained units, AFAA will usually provide a copy of the resulting draft AF-level ROA to
 8                                                   AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


        HQ ACC/FMPPM regardless of whether or not HQ ACC is designated an OPR or OCR
        for management comments. AFAA may also provide HQ ACC/FMPPM with draft
        reports concerning programs or areas which may affect ACC (even though audit work
        was not performed at HQ ACC or ACC units). HQ ACC/FMPPM will forward copies of
        the reports to appropriate HQ ACC staff focal points. These reports are provided for
        information and HQ ACC comments are not required. However, if the OPR or OCR
        feels comments are warranted, they may be provided through command channels to the
        USAF OPR for consideration and possible inclusion in the USAF response to AFAA. A
        courtesy copy of comments should be provided to HQ ACC/FMPPM.
        1.4.1.2. (Added-ACC) Comments are required if a HQ ACC directorate/SSA is
        identified as an OPR or OCR in a draft AF-level ROA. Prompt action is imperative since
        the HQ ACC suspense from Air Force is usually less than 15 days. HQ ACC/FMPPM
        will immediately notify the HQ ACC staff focal point by telecon of requirement for
        comments. Telecon will be followed by a written request and instructions from HQ
        ACC/FMPPM and/or Air Staff action office. Response should be prepared following the
        basic guidelines in paragraph 1.5. and attachment 2 of the basic regulation and paragraph
        1.5.5 of this supplement.
     1.4.2. Installation-Level Reports. The AFAA distributes each draft report to the designated
     unit audit focal point who forwards it to the functional OPR for comment. The audit focal
     point acts as a liaison officer between management and AFAA and monitors audit project
     and report processes, including follow-up tracking. AFAA addresses installation-level
     reports to the appropriate commander and to other units having oversight authority (e.g.,
     MAJCOM).
1.5. Management Comments. Management will respond in writing to all draft audit reports
containing recommendations or potential monetary benefits (PMB). Reference paragraph 1.5.3
for potential responses. AFAA includes management comments verbatim, along with an audit
evaluation, in the final report. The management OPR and AFAA auditors will coordinate closely
so the final report fully documents management’s position on issues in the report. Note:
Management may verbally coordinate on reports that do not contain recommendations or PMB.
     1.5.1. Comment Requirements. Management will write comments concisely and include:
        1.5.1.1. A statement of       concurrence    or   nonconcurrence    on   each    finding,
        recommendation, and PMB.
        1.5.1.2. Appropriate comments describing intended or completed corrective actions and
        an actual or estimated completion date for each corrective action. If corrective actions
        will take longer than a year, the management comments should contain interim
        milestones for completing major segments or action.
        1.5.1.2. (ACC) Management must include the required interim milestones in their
        comments to be included in the published final ROA.
        1.5.1.3. Rationale for any disagreements.
        1.5.1.4. Comments on the reasonableness of all auditor-estimated PMB. See Chapter 4
        for further information on PMB. Note: When management corrects deficiencies during
        the audit, the draft report normally presents the findings and recognizes management's
AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                            9


     actions in lieu of a recommendation. If the report contains PMB, management must still
     comment on the reasonableness of the PMB estimate.
     1.5.1.4. (ACC) Draft reports claiming potential monetary benefits (PMB) must be
     reviewed and coordinated by local financial analysis flight/division (FMA) before release
     of signed management comments.
     1.5.1.5. (Added-ACC) If draft ROA identifies repeat discrepancies management
     comments must include a statement outlining reasons why the condition continued to
     exist, the current status of corrective actions and cite the action taken to preclude
     recurrence.
     1.5.1.6. (Added-ACC) Signature Authority.     The Wing Commander/NAF
     Commander/HQ ACC Director to whom the report of audit is addressed will sign all
     management comments for release to AFAA.
     1.5.1.7. (Added-ACC) Focal points will forward a courtesy copy of signed draft ROA
     management comments to HQ ACC/FMPPM (IAW AFI 65-403, paragraphs 2.8.7 and
     2.10.3). If AFAA utilizes accelerated management comment process (management and
     auditor work closely to incorporate management comments into the draft report for
     commander’s approval), a copy of the coordination package signed by the commander
     should be forwarded to HQ ACC/FMPPM.
  1.5.2. Suspense Dates. For reports with recommendations or PMB, AFAA normally allows
  management 30 calendar days from the date of the draft report to provide written comments.
  For interim reports, AFAA normally allows management 15 calendar days. For reports with
  no recommendations or PMB, AFAA normally allows management 15 calendar days to
  provide a verbal or e-mail concurrence and 30 days to provide a written response.
  1.5.2. (ACC) Every effort must be made to meet established suspense dates for
  management comments. Focal points should monitor the process, ensure all extensions are
  requested in writing, and keep AFAA fully apprised.
     1.5.2.1. The AFAA can grant extensions for management comments in unusual
     circumstances. If management cannot respond by the due date, the management OPR
     telephones or e-mails the AFAA and requests an extension. AFAA can grant extensions,
     usually in 15-day increments, not to exceed 30 days from the original suspense date.
     1.5.2.2. For oral requests exceeding 15 days from the original suspense date, the
     management OPR will follow up with a written request that includes both the reasons for
     the delay and a firm date when AFAA can expect to get management comments.
  1.5.3. Potential Responses. The following list provides potential responses to audit
  recommendations. See Attachment 2 for specific examples of management comments.
     1.5.3.1. If management agrees with the findings, recommendations, and PMB, the
     management comments will describe corrective actions, both taken or planned, and give
     actual or planned completion dates. Planned completion dates should be at least 90 days
     from the date comments are provided. Reference paragraph A2.1.
     1.5.3.2. If management agrees with the findings and agrees action is required but not the
     actions recommended in the report, management can concur with intent and propose
     other ways to correct the reported deficiencies. The response must explain what action
10                                                AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


     management will take to correct the problem. AFAA evaluates the responses and does
     not consider such responses as nonresponsive if the alternative action would correct the
     problem. Reference paragraph A2.2.
     1.5.3.3. If management agrees with the findings and recommendations but disagrees with
     the PMB amount, management must clearly state the reason for disagreement and give a
     revised PMB estimate. If management disagrees there will be any PMB, the AFAA will
     elevate the entire amount as a nonconcurrence for resolution in accordance with Chapter
     3. If management agrees there will be a PMB, but specifies a lesser amount, the AFAA
     will elevate only the difference between the management estimate and the AFAA
     estimate. Reference paragraph A2.3
     1.5.3.4. If management nonconcurs with any finding, management comments should
     specify the reason for the nonconcurrence. The AFAA may elevate the nonconcurrence
     for resolution in accordance with Chapter 3. Reference paragraph A2.4.
     1.5.3.5. If management concurs with the finding but does not agree corrective actions are
     necessary, management should explicitly agree with the finding and explain the reason
     corrective actions are not appropriate. The AFAA audit team may elevate the
     nonconcurrence for resolution in accordance with Chapter 3. Reference paragraph A2.5.
  1.5.4. Disagreements. Management will notify AFAA immediately if they disagree with any
  report finding, recommendation, or PMB. Management will meet with AFAA and explain
  their position on the points of disagreement or introduce new information. These discussions
  promote effective corrective action by clarifying audit findings, recommendations, and PMB.
  AFAA may revise the draft report after discussions with management.
  1.5.4. (ACC) Disagreements. Meetings must be held with AFAA personnel and functional
  experts in an effort to resolve disagreements. Every effort must be made to resolve
  disagreements at the lowest possible management level. If management plans to nonconcur,
  they should contact their counterpart at the next command level to ensure their support.
  1.5.5. (Added-ACC) Processing Procedures for AFAA Draft Installation-Level ROAs
  Addressed to HQ ACC Directorates (including their direct reporting units), and SSAs.
     1.5.5.1. (Added-ACC) OPR will:
         1.5.5.1.1. (Added-ACC) Contact the local AFAA auditor to discuss any points of
         disagreement concerning findings, potential monetary benefit (PMB) or
         recommendations. Also, notify HQ ACC/FMPPM of potential disagreements. Every
         effort must be made to resolve all disagreements before issuing formal comments as
         stated in paragraphs 1.2.4.1 and 1.5.4 of this supplement.
         1.5.5.1.2. (Added-ACC) Prepare final coordinated management comments to
         findings, including PMB, and recommendations for director/SSA chief/commander
         signature in accordance with (IAW) AFI 65-301, paragraphs 1.5 and Attachment 2. If
         any unresolved nonconcurrences exist, comments must include the results of
         discussions with local AFAA officials and rationale/support for unresolved
         nonconcurrences. Response must be coordinated with all OCRs providing input,
         OPR staff focal point and HQ ACC/FMPPM, prior to signature. Reports claiming
AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                          11


         PMB must also be coordinated with HQ ACC/FMA (reference AFI 65-301,
         paragraph 4.6).
     1.5.5.2. (Added-ACC) OCRs must provide their comments to the OPR in sufficient
     time for incorporation into the OPR’s final written response.
     1.5.5.3. (Added-ACC) Staff focal point must review OPR written response to ensure
     conformance with directive requirements.
     1.5.5.4. (Added-ACC) Every effort must be made to meet the established suspense for
     management comments. If it becomes apparent the suspense cannot be met, OPR must
     immediately contact HQ ACC/FMPPM and request an extension. Verbal request must be
     followed by a written request stating reasons why original suspense cannot be met and
     stating when comments will be provided. Request must be coordinated with the staff
     focal point and signed at the division level. HQ ACC/FMPPM will work with the local
     area audit office to obtain suspense extensions. Extensions must not be considered
     automatic and AFAA retains the right to issue a final report without management
     comments at any time after their original 30-day suspense (reference AFI 65-301,
     paragraph 3.4.).
  1.5.6. (Added-ACC) HQ ACC Review of Installation-Level ROAs Issued to Subordinate
  Units:
     1.5.6.1. (Added-ACC) OPR is responsible for obtaining OCR inputs and preparing a
     coordinated response. OPR will:
         1.5.6.1.1. (Added-ACC) Review ROA findings, PMB, recommendations, and unit
         replies to ensure findings and related PMB are valid and recommendations and
         management comments are in line with ACC policy, and to determine the adequacy
         of corrective actions taken or planned.
         1.5.6.1.2. (Added-ACC) Initiate the resolution process (AFI 65-301, paragraph
         1.5.4 as supplemented and paragraph 3.3) by contacting HQ ACC/FMPPM if the
         ROA contains unit-level nonconcurrences or if the ACC staff non-concurs with an
         item in the report.
         1.5.6.1.3. (Added-ACC) Prepare a coordinated response to the ROA documenting
         the command’s review and position on the issues addressed in the ROA.
         1.5.6.1.4. (Added-ACC) Determine whether conditions reported in the ROA
         warrant the commander’s attention. Prepare a staff summary sheet to be coordinated
         with appropriate staff agencies. Provide a courtesy copy to HQ ACC/FMPPM.
         These conditions include, but are not limited to, conditions impacting the unit’s
         ability to meet mission requirements (sensitive areas such as loss of funds, loss of
         ammunition or weapons, loss of medical equipment or supplies (e.g.,
         pharmaceuticals); cases involving the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Office of
         Special Investigations or Security Forces Investigations, and significant non-
         concurrences which will be elevated to the Air Staff for resolution.
  1.5.7. (Added-ACC) OCR is responsible for reviewing the ROA IAW paragraphs 1.5.6.1.1.
  (Added) and 1.5.6.1.2. (Added) above and providing input to the OPR in sufficient time to
 12                                                  AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   allow incorporation into the OPR’s coordinated response. HQ ACC/FMA will be designated
   an OCR on all reports containing PMB.
1.6. Management Comments Evaluation. After the management OPR provides comments to
AFAA, the AFAA audit team will evaluate the comments to determine if they meet the
requirements of paragraph 1.5.1. and corrective actions, taken or proposed, are adequate and
timely. When management comments are not responsive or when management does not provide
comments within the required time, AFAA follows the procedures described in Chapter 3. When
management comments are responsive, the AFAA audit team inserts the comments and an
AFAA evaluation into the final report and distributes the report.
1.7. Revised Report Procedures. If, after issuing a draft report for comment, the audit
management team revises the report (paragraph 1.5.4.), the audit team will reissue the report for
comment. AFAA will allow management an appropriate amount of time to comment on the
revised report, not to exceed 30 days.
   1.7.1. Air Force-Level Reports. The Air Force Audit Agency, Pentagon Liaison Office
   (SAF/AGA) distributes copies of the revised draft Air Force-level report to the HQ USAF
   OPR and all other activities that received the initial draft report.
   1.7.2. Installation-Level Reports. The AFAA team chief distributes the revised draft report
   to the unit audit focal point and other activities that received the initial draft report.
1.8. Final Report Distribution.
   1.8.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA distributes final reports to applicable HQ USAF
   offices, SAF/FM, the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, applicable MAJCOMs, and the DoDIG.
   AFAA also prepares follow-up tracking sheets and forwards them to the Deputy Assistant
   Secretary for Financial Operations (SAF/FMP). SAF/FMP personnel monitor and report on
   the implementation of corrective actions agreed to in Air Force-level audit reports.
   1.8.2. Installation-Level Reports. AFAA distributes final installation-level reports to
   responsible unit officials and to applicable MAJCOM audit focal points. Both the unit and
   MAJCOM audit focal points, in turn, track the recommendations and ensure management
   implements all agreed-to corrective actions.
1.9. Report Availability. The draft report is an internal Air Force action document and is not
widely distributed. However, the final audit report is a historical document for use by internal
and external organizations. Within the Air Force, management and auditors use the final report
for reference. Outside the Air Force, government agencies such as the DoDIG, the Government
Accountability Office, and the Congress have access to the report. AFAA releases final reports
to the public, when requested, under the Freedom of Information Act.
AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                             13


                                          Chapter 2

                               ACCESS TO INFORMATION

2.1. Overview. Air Force management grants AFAA auditors access to information according
to AFPD 65-3. This chapter provides guidance for resolving access-related disagreements.
2.2. Elevation of Disagreements.
   2.2.1. If an installation refuses to allow access to needed information, the auditor sends
   written notice to the AFAA representative who attempts to resolve the issue with the
   MAJCOM OPR. If discussions with the MAJCOM OPR do not result in access to requested
   information within 5 work days of the disagreement, the AFAA representative forwards the
   request and the MAJCOM position to SAF/AGA, for immediate action.
   2.2.2. If management denies access for an Air Force-level audit and the AFAA directorate
   does not resolve the issue, the applicable Assistant Auditor General forwards the request and
   the results of any discussions to SAF/AGA, for immediate action.
2.3. HQ USAF Discussions. SAF/AGA refers access disagreements to the HQ USAF OPR for
review and possible resolution. If these discussions do not resolve the problem within
15 calendar days of the disagreement, SAF/AGA refers the request, along with MAJCOM and
HQ USAF positions, to SAF/AG who submits the package to the Secretary of the Air Force
(SECAF) for decision.
2.4. SECAF Decision. The SECAF makes a decision on the access denial within 30 calendar
days of the disagreement and advises applicable Air Force activities of the decision. In
accordance with provisions of DOD Instruction 7600.02, Audit Policies, SECAF advises the
DoDIG when the SECAF denies access to AFAA auditors.
2.5. Access to Joint Staff Information. Requests for joint information should be coordinated
through SAF/AGA (HQ AFAA/DOO) and DoDIG. Pursuant to the Inspector General Act of
1978, as amended, the Joint Staff must either provide access to the information or forward a
recommendation for denial to the Secretary of Defense for a determination within 30 calendar
days.
 14                                                 AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


                                          Chapter 3

                      NONCONCURRENCES (DISAGREEMENTS)

3.1. Required Resolution. Air Force management and audit officials must resolve all
disagreements within 6 months of the final report date according to AFPD 65-4, Followup on
Internal Air Force Audit Reports and Liaison with External Audit Organizations. Management
and audit must try to resolve any disagreements at the lowest management level possible. If they
cannot resolve the problem, AFAA must move the issues to the next higher level of authority,
where they will discuss and resolve the disagreements.
3.2. Final Air Force-Level Reports with Disagreements. SAF/AGA (HQ AFAA/DOO) refers
final reports to SAF/FMP for resolution whenever disagreements exist between the AFAA and
management officials. SAF/FMP submits final reports with unresolved issues to the Under
Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/US) for final resolution. See AFI 65-403, Follow-up on
Internal Air Force Audit Reports, for additional information.
3.3. Nonconcurrences with Installation-Level Reports. If local auditors and management
officials disagree on matters in a report and they cannot resolve the disagreement, the auditors
will prepare and issue the final report containing management’s non-responsive comments and
an audit rebuttal. The auditors will send the report within 5 work days to the AFAA MAJCOM
representative for resolution with the MAJCOM functional OPR.
   3.3.1. The MAJCOM OPR will evaluate the audit and local management positions and
   provide written comments to the AFAA MAJCOM representative and installation officials
   within 60 calendar days explaining the MAJCOM position.
       3.3.1.1. When MAJCOM supports the audit position, the OPR can, with AFAA
       representative concurrence, include proposed alternative actions to correct the problem.
       3.3.1.2. When MAJCOM supports the management position, the AFAA representative
       will evaluate the MAJCOM position and either close out the disagreement or elevate it to
       SAF/AGA for resolution.
   3.3.2. When elevating a disagreement for resolution, the AFAA MAJCOM representative
   will send SAF/AGA a copy of the report, applicable management comments, the MAJCOM
   written position, and other information derived from previous resolution efforts within 90
   calendar days of the final report date. The AFAA MAJCOM representative will advise the
   MAJCOM OPR of this action.
   3.3.3. Working with HQ USAF, SAF/AGA may take an additional 90 calendar days to
   resolve the nonconcurrence. The SAF/AGA representative will evaluate the HQ USAF OPR
   position and either close out the nonconcurrence or elevate through SAF/FMP for a final
   decision.
   3.3.4. SAF/US is the final resolution authority. While SAF/US has delegated authority to
   decide nonconcurrences in installation-level issues to SAF/FMP, management or AFAA can
   appeal the SAF/FMP decision to SAF/US.
3.4. Late or Not Received Management Comments.
AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                               15


  3.4.1. Air Force-Level Reports. If management does not provide comments for Air Force-
  level reports by the last revised due date (not to exceed 60 calendar days from the date of
  draft report issuance), the AFAA audit team, in coordination with SAF/AGA, will contact the
  Air Force action officer weekly to discuss (a) problems encountered, (b) the potential for
  resolution, and (c) the estimated date to receive signed comments. After 75 calendar days,
  the applicable Assistant Auditor General may get involved to resolve the problems delaying
  receipt of management comments. After 90 calendar days, the AFAA may issue the final
  report without management comments and submit the report to SAF/FMP for resolution in
  accordance with paragraph 3.3.
  3.4.2. Installation-Level Reports. If management does not provide comments to the draft
  report within 30 calendar days, the AFAA audit team will meet with unit officials to
  determine the specific cause for the delay and, if appropriate, provide additional time for unit
  officials to prepare their response. If management comments are not received after
  60 calendar days, the AFAA will issue the final report without management comments.
     3.4.2.1. If it becomes necessary to issue a final report without management comments,
     the MAJCOM OPR must act immediately to ensure the subordinate unit commander
     responds to the audit report. If the unit commander provides comments within
     30 calendar days after the final report date, AFAA will evaluate the comments. If the
     comments are responsive (either concurrences or nonconcurrences), AFAA will reissue
     the final report with the management comments and AFAA evaluation inserted. If the
     comments are not responsive, AFAA will send the comments to the AFAA MAJCOM
     Representative for resolution in accordance with paragraph 3.3. Concurrently, the unit
     audit focal point will provide the comments to the MAJCOM audit focal point to
     facilitate the resolution process.
     3.4.2.2. If the AFAA receives no comments within 30 calendar days following the final
     report date, the AFAA will, within 5 work days, elevate the report to the AFAA
     MAJCOM Representative for resolution. If not done previously, the unit audit focal
     point will elevate the report to the MAJCOM audit focal point for resolution.

                           POTENTIAL MONETARY BENEFITS

4.1. Definition. Potential monetary benefits:
   4.1.1. Are an estimate the AFAA measures and expresses as a dollar value and expects the
   DOD or the Federal Government overall to save if management implements audit
   recommendations.
   4.1.2. Represent the best estimate or an actual known amount at the time the auditor
   prepared the audit report.
   4.1.3. Can be either funds put to better use or questioned cost, but not both.
4.2. Funds Put to Better Use. Most PMB resulting from internal audit are classified as “funds
put to better use.” “Funds put to better use” means that if management implements the audit
recommendations, funds could be used to meet other requirements. The following list shows
examples of actions that result in “funds put to better use”:
   4.2.1. Reductions in outlays.
   4.2.2. Allowing funds from programs or operations to be deobligated and used in programs
   or operations other than that for which they were originally budgeted.
   4.2.3. Withdrawal of interest subsidy costs on loans or loan guarantees, insurance, or bonds.
   4.2.4. Costs avoided by implementing recommended improvements for the operations of the
   establishment, a contractor, or a grantee.
   4.2.5. Avoiding unnecessary spending noted in pre-award reviews of contract or grant
   agreements.
   4.2.6. Reduction to any requirement with an ongoing or planned procurement.
4.3. Questioned Cost. When an auditor questions an incurred cost because of one of the
following factors, it is known as “questioned cost”:
   4.3.1. An alleged violation of a provision of a law, regulation, contract, grant, cooperative
   agreement, or other agreement or document that governs the expenditure of funds.
   4.3.2. A cost that, at the time of the audit, is not supported by adequate documentation.
   4.3.3. An expenditure of funds that is unnecessary or unreasonable for the intended purpose
   (applicable to incurred cost audits, such as those for defective pricing on defense contracts).
4.4. Disallowed Cost. When management, in a management decision, sustains or agrees a
questioned cost should not be charged to the government, it is known as a “disallowed cost”
(applicable to incurred cost audits, such as those for defective pricing on defense contracts).
4.5. Computation. Auditors compute estimated monetary benefits from the most reasonable
data available. Actual monetary benefits are often impossible or impractical to determine.
Therefore, auditors base estimates on generally accepted principles, models, or formulas. For
example, AFAA auditors use the lower limit when expressing a single amount for a statistically
projected range of values.
AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                17


   4.5.1. Monetary benefit computations include any appropriate offset costs. Offset costs
   include all direct or indirect costs incurred in implementing the action that will result in the
   monetary benefit.
   4.5.2. PMB can be one-time or annual. Annual benefits recur for an indefinite period of
   time, but AFAA limits computations to a 6-year period; that is, the current year plus five.
4.6. Coordination. AFAA personnel coordinate PMB amounts of $50,000 or more with the
audited organization during the normal draft report discussion period.
4.6. (ACC)Coordination. The focal point will provide copies of all reports of audit claiming
PMB to the local FMA functional for review to ensure accuracy of appropriation data,
reasonableness of auditor’s methodology/computations and, validity of monetary benefits
achieved or expected to accrue. HQ ACC/FMPPM will provide copies to HQ ACC/FMA for the
same purpose.
4.7. Summary of Audit Results (SAR) Statement. The AFAA attaches a SAR statement to
each draft report given to management. The SAR statement explains PMB of $50,000 or more.
The report will normally explain PMB amounts of less than $50,000, or management can ask for
an explanation from the auditor. The amount included in the SAR statement will agree with the
amount in the report.
4.8. Management Response.
   4.8.1. Management can agree or disagree with the estimated PMB in reports of audit.
   However, management should not disagree with the audit estimate solely to defer the
   decision until actual benefits materialize.
   4.8.2. Management should comment on the reasonableness of the auditor's estimate and
   must justify disagreements with evidence that supports an alternate estimate.
4.9. Reporting Potential Monetary Benefits. AFAA includes all PMB in the Semi-Annual
Report to the Congress and the Follow-up Status Report.

                                           Chapter 5

                          NONAPPROPRIATED FUND AUDITS

5.1. Nonappropriated Fund Audit Requirements.
   5.1.1. HQ Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA) arranges for annual financial audits of
   central NAF instrumentalities and individual NAF activities with annual revenues or
   expenses exceeding $7 million. Groups of activities, such as the installation Morale,
   Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Fund, are not subject to this audit requirement even if
   revenues or expenses exceed $7 million. However, individual entities in an MWR Fund
   (installation, MAJCOM, or Air Force) with annual revenues or expenses exceeding
   $7 million must have annual financial audits. Exceptions to these audit requirements must be
   approved by the DoDIG.
   5.1.2. Annual audits are also required for highly sensitive situations, such as potential fraud
   or large public exposure. Other audits, as deemed necessary by management and the Air
   Force Services Audit Committee (paragraph 5.2), are conducted based on assessed risk and
   resource availability.
   5.1.3. ANG NAF activities that are properly approved, operated in accordance with ANG
   regulations, and receive no appropriated fund support need not undergo an audit by federal
   entities or audits contracted by those entities.
5.2. Air Force Services Audit Committee. Air Force will establish and maintain an audit
committee made up of senior officials independent of NAF management to oversee audits of
NAF activities. The audit committee shall establish requirements for all NAF audits and base the
requirements upon the application of risk assessments. The Auditor General of the Air Force
will serve as an advisor to the audit committee, but shall not be part of the committee.
5.3. Audit Coverage of Nonappropriated Fund Activities.
   5.3.1. Public Accountant Audits. Each year, NAFs are budgeted and approved for certified
   public accountant firms to audit Air Force NAF activities. The audit committee shall
   establish requirements and identify contract deliverables for the public accountant audits and
   assist in monitoring the conduct of financial statement audits. Certified public accountant
   audit responsibilities are listed in Attachment 3, Section A3B.
   5.3.2. AFAA Audits. In addition to the public accountant audits, the AFAA performs audits
   of NAF activities. Much like the Air Force Inspector General and other appropriated fund
   organizations, AFAA is considered “oversight” and the use of AFAA is authorized to provide
   audit support to NAF activities. Moreover, audit is a necessary component of oversight to
   ensure Air Force resources are properly and efficiently used to support NAF activities.
   Accordingly, AFAA “oversight” audits will be performed without NAF reimbursement. The
   AFAA:
       5.3.2.1. Does not have internally or externally established NAF limits of audit coverage.
       The AFAA schedules and performs NAF audits as deemed appropriate.
       5.3.2.2. Includes Air Force-wide system and functional reviews of NAF activities in the
       AFAA annual audit plan when appropriate.
AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                               19


      5.3.2.3. Includes installation-level audits of NAF activities in area audit office annual
      audit plans, based on audit priorities.
      5.3.2.4. Notifies HQ AFSVA of planned audits on NAF activities to avoid duplicate
      audits.
      5.3.2.5. Provides copies of installation-level reports on NAF activities to the installation
      audit focal point, HQ AFSVA/SVFR, SAF/FMCEB, and the applicable MAJCOM audit
      focal point.
      5.3.2.6. Should be used for audits of NAF activities involving suspected fraud and other
      serious improprieties rather than public accountants.
5.4. Audits of Private Organizations. The Air Force does not provide appropriated funds,
NAFs, or personnel supported by these funds to audit private organizations such as museum
foundations, thrift shops, Air Force Aid Societies, scouting groups, spouses’ clubs, and
auxiliaries on Air Force installations, unless authorized by the SECAF. When indications of
fraud or other improprieties exist, regardless of the amount of revenues, the commander can
request an AFAA audit to protect Air Force interest.
5.5. Processing Public Accountant Reports. The Public Accountant Contract Audit (PACA)
program requires public accountants to issue a separate report for each audit.
5.5. (ACC)Processing Public Accountant Reports. The MAJCOM focal point for public
accountant contract audits (PACA) is the ACC Nonappropriated Funds Oversight Branch (HQ
ACC/FMPN).
   5.5.1. Reporting Level. The PACA program requires public accountants to prepare and
   distribute NAF activity reports based on the terms of the contract.
      5.5.1.1. When findings and recommendations are system-wide or procedural, public
      accountants consolidate installation-level audit results and issue a report to HQ AFSVA
      which will work with the appropriate oversight board or committee to correct any
      deficiencies.
      5.5.1.2. Public accountants should promptly report any findings that suggest irregular
      conduct or the possibility of fraud to the Air Force Services Agency, Contract Audit
      Management Office, and the installation’s servicing Air Force Office of Special
      Investigations (AFOSI) detachment.
   5.5.2. Management Comments. Commanders of audited activities prepare management
   comments for each finding and recommendation in the audit report and give them to the
   public accountant firm within 35 calendar days (50 days for overseas) from the date they
   receive the draft audit report.
   5.5.3. Evaluation of Management Comments. In the installation-level report, public
   accountants evaluate the responsiveness and adequacy of management comments for each
   finding and recommendation. They state whether the actions taken or planned respond to the
   recommendations and if any alternative management actions correct the reported deficiency.
   When public accountants evaluate management comments as nonresponsive, the accountant
   explains why management actions are inadequate. These evaluations follow each
   management response in the final report.
 20                                                  AFI65-301_ACCSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   5.5.4. Report Distribution. The contract quality assurance evaluator normally receives and
   distributes the public accountant report to the following:
       5.5.4.1. Installation commander.
       5.5.4.2. Local audit focal point.
       5.5.4.3. Manager of the activity audited.
       5.5.4.4. Servicing AFAA area audit office and AFOSI detachment.
       5.5.4.5. NAF Accounting Office.
       5.5.4.6. Base liaison between FM and SV (usually the NAF Financial Analyst).
   5.5.5. Command Review. MAJCOM Services staffs review public accountant reports,
   advise activity commanders on preparing management comments, suggest or direct
   corrective actions where necessary, and monitor implementation of corrective actions.
   HQ AFSVA also periodically crossfeeds internal control weaknesses, findings, and
   recommendations that public accountants identify during audits to Services
   Commanders/Division Chiefs within the Air Force.
   5.5.6. Resolution of Nonconcurrences. SAF/FM works with HQ AFSVA and the
   appropriate oversight board or committee to resolve disagreements with findings or
   recommendations in public accountant audit reports that cannot be resolved at MAJCOM
   level. If SAF/FM cannot resolve the disagreements, they follow policy in AFPD 65-4. The
   resolution period is 6 months from the date the public accountant issues the report.
5.6. Processing Air Force Audit Agency Audit Reports. AFAA addresses, processes, and
distributes reports on NAF activities according to the requirements detailed in Chapter 1 of this
instruction. AFAA reports on NAF activities receive management follow-up attention as
specified in AFPD 65-4.

   participation by both professional audit organizations and allow managers to de-conflict any
   scheduled coverage by both organizations.
   A3.10.4. Schedule follow-on work on public accountant audits, as appropriate, to determine
   whether significant problems detected in the public accountant reports were corrected.
