                                          Chapter 2

                     CARGO ROUTING AND MOVEMENT POLICY

2.1. Introduction. Air Force TOs and Deployment and Distribution Flights will use DTR
4500.9-R, Parts II, III, V and VI as their primary guide to direct their organization‘s shipping
activities. This document is a supplement to the DTR and provides the TO and other AF
transportation shipping activities amplification, interpretation and exceptions to DOD shipping
rules. There are many AF programs, tests and other efforts to enhance the movement of material
throughout the AF Supply Chain and this document is set up to explain these AF unique
transportation solutions without duplicating instructions found in the DTR.
   2.1.1. CMOS use is mandatory for all Air Force deployment and distribution cargo
   movement functions and is the CSAF IDS directed system used for wing-level deployment,
   contingency passenger and cargo processing. GATES can be used in place of CMOS for
   deployment air manifesting at AMC strategic ports/onload locations (see paragraph
   18.9.1.1.).
   2.1.2. Deployable CMOS (DCMOS) use is mandatory for deployed cargo movement
   activities.
2.2. Establishing Priorities of AF Shipments. Transportation Priority (TP) and applicable
Time Definite Delivery (TDD) Standards are found in DOD 4140.1-R (DOD Supply Chain
Materiel Management Regulation), Appendix 8. TOs and other AF shippers will follow the
instructions identified in DTR, Part II, Paragraph 203-B.3. for establishing movement priorities
for AF Shipments. http://www.transcom.mil/j5/pt/dtrpart2/dtr_part_ii_203.pdf (see note 3,
Table 2.1).
   2.2.1. Air Force shipment planners assign the transportation priority based on the supply
   priority designator and/or RDD printed on DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt
   Document, DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, or Memorandum
   for non-MILSTRIP shipments. See Table 3.1. for converting the supply priority designator
   for MILSTRIP shipments, or Table 3.2. for converting customer RDD for non-MILSTRIP
   shipments, to the appropriate transportation priority (TP).
2.3. Air Force Expedited Service. The AF has determined that certain material (identified by
Project Code and/or other data on the issue document—DD Form 1348-1A, DD Form 1149 etc.)
must be moved in accordance with Table 2.1. time standards. The following shipment categories
will be afforded expedited service (sustainment or retrograde):
   2.3.1. TP-1 with N**/999 RDD and eligible for small parcel express service.
   2.3.2. Agile Logistics (project code 858) Note: See para 2.3.10 for further guidance.
   2.3.3. Two Level Maintenance (2LM—project code 879) Note: See para 2.3.10 for further
   guidance.
   2.3.4. Rapid Parts Movement (RPM—project code 880) Note: See para 2.3.10 for further
   guidance.
   2.3.5. Source of Repair (SOR).

     2.3.6. In Place Readiness Spares Packages (project code 122).
     2.3.7. Mobility Readiness Spares Packages (project code 123).
     2.3.8. Materiel Deficiency Report (MDR) exhibits that ground an entire Mission Designated
     Series or items that must be evaluated because of fatalities.
     2.3.9. Forward Supply Locations (FSL—project code 196).
     2.3.10. For repairable retrograde to repair location (Depot or Contractor) items other than
     (TP-1 with N**/999 RDD) returning to Depot, TOs are authorized to use small package
     express ground service within CONUS unless specifically directed by AFGLSC or item
     manager (IM) to use expedited overnight service. Table 2.1 provides the delivery standards
     for these exceptional shipments.

   NOTES:
   1. Materiel Management and Cargo Movement collective processing standard is 24 hours. This time starts when
   Materiel Management or Cargo Movement receives an item for shipment processing and ends when the selected
   carrier receipts for pick up. For 2LM items, 24-hour Materiel Management/Cargo Movement standard starts when
   Materiel Management or Cargo Movement receives a not reparable this station (NRTS) item from Maintenance for
   processing.

   2. Transit time is calculated from the time stated in specific contracts/tenders, or from the time consignor releases
   shipment to carrier, or from the time AMC receives shipment from consignor when the consignor and POE are co-
   located, to time of delivery to ultimate destination.

   3. TDD Standards are being changed in DoD 4140.M and will be placed in electronic form to reflect TDD across
   Integrated Distribution Lanes by theater.
 24                                         AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


2.4. Mode/Method Eligibility. Mode is a category of movement (e.g., air, surface) and method
is a means of movement within a mode, such as motor or rail, AMC channel, small package air
carrier, or SEAVAN. See DTR Part II, Appendix GG for complete list of mode/method codes
and descriptions. The TO/Shipment planners determine the appropriate mode/method and select
the carrier to move the materiel to destination consistent with the delivery requirement. When
on-time delivery is not achievable, TO will select carrier/mode with closest performance to target
RDD, preferably one that does not exceed the target RDD.
      2.4.1. Air. The TO must move AF Expedited shipments via door-to-door commercial air
      express carrier service when eligible. TOs should consider use of standard next day service
      versus expedited next day service. Additionally depending on location if small package
      carrier offers one day ground service within CONUS, this is the preferred method if more
      cost effective.
         2.4.1.1. Other TP2 shipments coded 777 or 555 can move door-to-door air express when
         this method proves more cost effective than AMC. Rates for comparing WWX and
         channel airlift over high volume routes are available on AMC‘s website
         https://private.amc.af.mil/A4/WWX/wwx.htm (click on WWX/IHX Rate Calculators).
         Current     year    AMC       rates    for    all   channels   are     available    at
         http://public.transcom.mil/j8/fin/rates_homepage.cfm. Include all costs incurred from
         point of origin to AMC port and to final destination. Use AMC channel service when
         shipment characteristics preclude movement by commercial carrier express service, or
         host nation customs does not permit entry by a commercial method or during interrupted
         services.
      2.4.2. Surface.
         2.4.2.1. TP2 shipments coded 777 or 555 can move door-to-door small package express
         carrier ground service within the CONUS when this method proves more cost effective
         than standard overnight service.
         2.4.2.2. TP-3 is shipped via surface modes. TP-3 shipments are not air eligible except
         for items with short expiration dates to include whole blood, perishable subsistence,
         biological, batteries, required refrigeration, radioactive, and like items. Shippers must
         ensure the ATCMD properly identifies these exceptional TP-3 shipments.
         2.4.2.3. Commercial air or expedited ground service-modes/methods may be selected
         when the cost is equal to or less than the normal surface cost mode/method.
         2.4.2.4. Deferred Airfreight (TP-4), via AMC, is a possible alternative to surface
         movement, depending on space considerations.
      2.4.3. Deferred Airfreight/TP-4. TP-4 is non-air-eligible materiel moving by military air on
      a space-available basis at or near the surface/sealift cost. This includes movement of
      household goods to non-hardlift areas. TOs are encouraged to request deferred airfreight/TP-
      4 for cargo movement. Pre-clearance must be received from the ACA or port before cargo is
      shipped to the port for TP-4 movement. Clearance of deferred airfreight requires that TP-4
      be shown in the priority field of the ATCMD. TP-4 must also be shown in the priority block
      of the shipping label. Hazardous, explosive and material requiring special handling in transit
      cannot be shipped as TP-4 without the prior approval of HQ AMC/A4TC. See DTR Part II
      for further guidance.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                         25


2.5. Carrier Selection. The TO/Shipment planners will apply best value carrier criteria to the
maximum extent possible when making carrier selections. Refer to Attachment 1, Terms; and
DTR, Part II, Definitions, for additional best value guidance.
   2.5.1. For domestic shipments, carriers must be TPPS capable. This is accomplished by
   carriers establishing a Trading Partner Agreement with US Bank. See DTR Part II,
   Paragraph 212-C2e.
   2.5.2. Carriers, other than USPS, must have an approved tender of service or contract on file
   (hard copy or electronic) with AMC, GSA, or Surface Deployment and Distribution
   Command (SDDC). Local air shipment procedures can be established when the TO can
   document a negative critical mission impact to justify non-usage of AMC-
   arranged/operated/negotiated airlift.      Certain contracts specify mandatory use, with
   exceptions noted. Select other carriers, not within the scope of a contract, using best value
   criteria defined in DTR Part II. TOs may use approved munitions carriers, who have FAK
   rates on file, when it is determined by risk assessment decision guidance in DTR, Part II, that
   certain types of general commodities should be afforded added protection services. These
   items include inert (non-explosive) and other non-hazardous items with new technology, high
   value, or by design may be perceived by the public to be hazardous.
       2.5.2.1. The Defense Transportation Coordinator Initiative (DTCI) is a FAR-based,
       requirements-based contract used at selected Air Force bases identified as high volume
       shipping activities. The contract is for CONUS to CONUS only, and use of DTCI for
       shipments from these selected bases is mandatory. Additionally, while not all bases will
       ship using DTCI, all bases will receive cargo moved under DTCI, including shipments
       from DLA. Use of DTCI to ship AA&E, Classified, Sensitive, NWRM or protected cargo
       is prohibited. Additionally, it is restricted to shipments over 150 lbs. The TO forwards
       requirements to contractor via electronic data interchange from CMOS and the contractor
       provides mode, and carrier information in a confirmation transaction back to CMOS
       based on the TO‘s input of the Mandatory Delivery Date (MDD). DTCI is mode neutral
       and will select air or surface to meet the MDD for routine or expedited cargo.
       Additionally, loss and damage claims are handled outside of the normal TDR process.
       Air Force shipping/receiving activities will refer to the specific instructions for DTCI in
       the DTR Part II, Chapter 213.
       2.5.2.2. Only those individuals identified by the DTCI Contracting Officer (CO) can
       direct the Contractor to perform. Certified Ordering Officers (COOs) (most are TOs),
       and CORs can direct the Contractor to perform within the limits of the existing contract,
       however, only the CO can obligate the Government for performance outside the limits of
       the contract.. The Air Force COR is 401 SCMS/GUMAA. For further information on
       DTCI TO‘s are encouraged to review the DTCI Performance Work Statement (PWS) at:
       http://www.transcom.mil/dtci/.
   2.5.3. Commercial air express small-package delivery service through approved AMC
   contracts and tenders is the norm for Air Force Expedited shipments to meet Air Force
   sustainment goals. Use AMC approved contracts, tenders, or operating airlift channels for
   other airlift eligible shipments between CONUS/OCONUS and within OCONUS.
26                                        AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


     2.5.4. DOD Domestic Express Small Package Service (DESPS)--formerly GSA Multiple
     Award              Schedule              Blanket             Purchase         Agreement
     (https://private.amc.af.mil/a4/domexpress/spsindex.html). High priority shipments that
     meet the DESPS terms, will move via DOD DESPS carrier(s) to DOD and contract addresses
     to/from CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The DESPS provides time-definite,
     door-to-door, domestic express delivery of letters and small packages. No single package
     may exceed 150 pounds gross weight. Therefore, Air Force Expedited shipments destined
     to/from CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico should be moving by a DESPS carrier(s)
     from pick-up to delivery at the consigned destination. See Paragraph 5.12.
        2.5.4.1. The DOD is a mandatory user of the DOD DESPS, EXCEPT in the following
        instances:
            2.5.4.1.1. DOD shipments between 0 and 500 miles from origin.
            2.5.4.1.2. DOD shipments under DOD contracts in effect prior to award of this
            contract until expiration of the existing contracts or agreements.
            2.5.4.1.3. When required by wartime contingency operations.
            2.5.4.1.4. When shipments are outside the scope of the contract.
            2.5.4.1.5. Individual shipments with a gross weight of 151 pounds or more are
            outside the scope of this contract.
        2.5.4.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Units with specific needs to establish and operate
        DoD Domestic Express Small Package Services (DESPS) accounts (e.g. hospital lab,
        geographically separated units) will:
            2.5.4.2.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Provide memorandum requests to the
            installation TO for consideration prior to liaison with commercial carriers and
            establishment of account.
            2.5.4.2.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Process and ship only certain items within
            the scope of authority as agreed upon by the TO (e.g. AA&E, classified items,
            international shipments, and any other item outside their scope of authority).
            2.5.4.2.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Ensure proper payment of carrier services
            rendered using the appropriate Transportation Account Code or Operations and
            Maintenance appropriations. The only time a Government Purchase Card is used to
            pay for shipping is when the unit is shipping an item back to the manufacture and the
            manufacture will not pay the transportation charges.
     2.5.5. AMC        Worldwide      Express      (WWX)        Small       Package      Contract
     (https://private.amc.af.mil/A4/WWX/wwx.htm).            WWX is an USTRANSCOM
     commercial contract that provides time-definite, door-to-door, international express delivery
     of letters and small packages. No single package may exceed 300 pounds gross weight.
     Service is provided from CONUS (includes Alaska/ Hawaii/Puerto Rico) to OCONUS,
     OCONUS to CONUS (retrograde routes) and OCONUS to OCONUS (lateral routes).
        2.5.5.1. DOD is a mandatory user of WWX.
        2.5.5.2. Classified shipments are not authorized for movement by WWX contract
        service.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                         27


      2.5.5.3. Movement of hazardous material (HAZMAT) by WWX contract service is
      restricted. HAZMAT is not covered under WWX basic services. However, very limited
      HAZMAT service is available. If a carrier handles HAZMAT as part of their regular
      commercial practice, then the government is authorized to use that service. If used, the
      DOD customer will be charged the WWX rate, plus an accessorial fee from the carrier‘s
      commercial service guide.
      2.5.5.4. Where two or more contract carriers are authorized to serve the same region, use
      best value criteria as specified in DTR Part II to award shipments. Equal sharing of
      tonnage IS NOT a requirement.
      2.5.5.5. Shippers must provide an in the clear address to ensure delivery. OCONUS
      APOs, FPOs, and PO box numbers are not acceptable for WWX shipments. Foreign
      postal     codes     must     be      used     and      may      be      found at:
      http://www.bitboost.com/ref/international-address-formats.html#Formats
2.6. Export/Import of Goods
   2.6.1. US Import. To ensure shipments flow through US Customs, OCONUS shipping
   offices must provide the following information on all commercial air shipments.
      2.6.1.1. Airway Bill. The first line of the shipper block must identify United States Air
      Force as the shipper followed by the shipper unit. The consignee block must start with
      United States__________ (sponsoring military service) followed by the recipient name
      and address. Providing the sponsoring component command is critical on shipments
      consigned to commercial contractors and vendors.
      2.6.1.2. Commercial Invoices. The commercial invoice will be printed on Air Force
      letterhead to ensure US Customs can easily identify the shipment as a DOD shipment.
      Shipper and consignee information must reflect the sponsoring component command per
      Paragraph 2.6.1.1., a clear detailed description of the item, item value, and a statement of
      ownership, i.e., Property of the United States Government.
      2.6.1.3. American Goods Returned (AGR). US Customs requires a statement identifying
      AGR assets be printed on the commercial invoice. The complete statement can be found
      in    19   CFR      (Code     of  Federal    Regulations)   10.103     at   website:
      http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html#page1.
   2.6.2. US Export. To ensure host nation customs clearance and routing requirements are
   met, refer to DTR, Part V. The DTR, DOD 4500.54G, DOD Foreign Clearance Guide
   (FCG), CFR Titles and Customs Bulletins can be accessed at the following USTRANSCOM
   website: https://business.transcom.mil/j5/j5p/customs/DODcustoms.cfm.
      2.6.2.1. Accurate cargo descriptions and complete addresses are essential requirements
      for all international shipments of DOD property, especially when commercial
      transportation is used.
         2.6.2.1.1. Use of terms such as Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), Said to Contain
         (STC), Freight All Kinds (FAK), Consolidated Cargo, General Merchandise, or No
         Description (Blank) are not acceptable for customs clearance purposes. Also avoid
         generic descriptions such as ―aircraft part,‖ which can cause delays in the customs
         clearance process. Use the Harmonized Code
 28                                         AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


             http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/bychapter/index.htm/ to determine the most
             descriptive nomenclature based on, NSN, part number, and other data presented by
             supply activity or vendor.
             2.6.2.1.2. For shipments to DOD activities, the correct consignee address can be
             found      in   the        AF     DODAAC          Web      Management       System
             (https://dodaac.wpafb.af.mil). Use the in-the-clear name of the consignee as well as
             the required DODAAC address.
         2.6.2.2. In accordance with 22 CFR 120.5, the export of articles covered by the U.S.
         Munitions List (USML) is regulated by the Department of State, except as indicated
         otherwise in the subchapter. If the item is on the USML, it requires a Shipper‘s Export
         Declaration (SED) for export. If it is not on the USML (i.e., a general commodity), then
         no SED is required IAW 15 CFR 30.52. See DTR Part V, Para 508-D for additional
         information, including how to determine if the item is on the USML or not
         (http://www.transcom.mil/j5/ppt/dtrart5/dtr_part_v_504_508.pdf).
2.7. Preventing DOD Shipments to Restricted Countries
      2.7.1. DOD shipments, whether moving organically or commercially, must only be
      consigned and routed to destinations authorized to receive these shipments. All shipping
      activities, to include MEO and A-76 organizations, will maintain the most current list of
      embargoed countries from the Department of State Embargoed Countries List in the
      following URL: http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/embargoed_countries/. TOs will have this
      list available in all areas involved in the requisition and shipment processes.
      2.7.2. The Department of State currently lists both Afghanistan and Iraq as restricted
      countries; however, in light of current operations, these two countries are exempt from the
      requirement for unit and MAJCOM/A4 approval.
      2.7.3. Shipments in support of on-going or recurring mission requirements to Air Force units
      located in Restricted Countries not identified in the paragraph above to established and valid
      DODAACs do not require an authorization for each individual shipment.
      2.7.4. The TO will notify the unit commander of any shipments to a restricted/embargoed
      country and begin a validation process of documentation to ensure the request is from an
      authoritative source. The unit commander will notify the affected MAJCOM of the request
      and forward a package with a recommendation to approve or disapprove to the applicable
      MAJCOM/A4 for signature.
2.8. Increased Liability Coverage and Excess Valuation. The purpose of purchasing
increased shipment liability coverage or declaring excess valuation is to increase the loss and/or
damage recovery when it is in the best interests of the Government. Specific liability terms,
conditions and rules must be known for each commercial carrier or contractor doing business.
      2.8.1. The Government is normally considered a self-insurer. Requirements to purchase
      additional coverage should be minimal. Consider increased liability coverage or excess
      valuation for prototype and one-of-a-kind items.
      2.8.2. TOs must know the shipment unit commodity and value to effectively protect the
      Government interests. The cost of buying or increasing the level of protective service may
      outweigh a decision to buy increased liability coverage or excess valuation. In addition, the
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                         29


   maximum amount of automatic carrier coverage for loss or damage (no accessorial charges)
   must also be known before determining a course of action.
   2.8.3. Small package express carriers/contractors are not always the most economical
   method of transport when determining if the added cost to purchase increased liability
   coverage or excess valuation is a sound decision. Use of small package carrier service, that
   is mandatory and meets Air Force Expedited shipment requirements, will not be waived for
   the purpose of purchasing increased carrier coverage by other methods.
2.9. Space Blocking. With the exception of AMC MICAP cargo directly supporting AMC
airlift assets, Air Force cargo will not be space blocked on AMC channel missions. Changes to
precedence of movement for materiel in the AMC channel will be done through green and purple
sheet procedures described in Chapter 3 of this AFI.
2.10. Movement on Organic Airlift. AF organic airlift can be used to move AF MICAP cargo
when standard commercial or AMC channels do not meet mission requirements. Protected and
hazardous materials will be transported IAW all applicable publications and guidance
   2.10.1. Requirement for movement by organic air will be initiated by the AFGLSC and
   documented using a standard format. The documentation will accompany the DD Form
   1348-1A or DD Form 1149. The documentation will identify the appropriate working capital
   fund (WCF) or SDT CMA TAC to use for any required commercial or AMC channel
   movement. Local funds will not be used to support any movement to position, deposition or
   forward cargo identified for organic airlift support.
   2.10.2. If the eligible MICAP cargo must move commercially from origin to another
   location to meet organic lift, the origin TO will process using best value carrier that meets
   required delivery date and use the provided TAC. Shipment will be marked for the TO at the
   in-transit node and transshipped in CMOS. The origin shall provide the AFGLSC with
   shipment details (TCN, P/W/C, SCAC, ETA) upon shipment release.
   2.10.3. Eligible MICAP cargo moving on organic air movement will be manifested by the
   local TO using CMOS. If cargo is trans-loaded to another organic air mission, a new
   manifest will be generated.
   2.10.4. If for any reason the use of organic lift is disrupted (e.g., the eligible cargo misses
   mission departure time, the organic air mission does not reach its destination) the AF TO at
   the location with the cargo will request disposition from the AFGLSC 439 th Supply Chain
   Operations Squadron at 439scos.transportation@langley.af.mil. If no instructions are
   provided within 18 hours, the TO will process the shipment for onward commercial
   movement following local MICAP procedures. Cargo will be in-checked and transshipped in
   CMOS.
   2.10.5. AFMC will maintain data for all organic air movement comparing actual end-to-end
   organic air performance with notional end-to-end commercial and/or AMC performance.
   This data will show total end-to-end time and transportation cost achieved utilizing organic
   air and the notional end-to-end cost anticipated if cargo moved via commercial and/or AMC
   carriage. This data will be provided to AF/A4LM on a quarterly basis.

                                            Chapter 3

               SHIPPER, TRANSHIPPER, AND RECEIVER PROCEDURES

3.1. Processing Material for Shipment. The TO processes two types of shipments -
MILSTRIP and non-MILSTRIP:
     3.1.1. MILSTRIP Shipments (DD Form 1348-1A). MILSTRIP shipments are processed
     through the base level supply system and CMOS. Use DD Form 1348-1A as the shipment
     planning worksheet for MILSTRIP shipments. Cargo Movement Section action begins on
     MILSTRIP shipments when documentation and materiel are accepted from Materiel
     Management Section. The Cargo Movement Section in-checker may accept originating base
     Materiel Management Section materiel as documented. A piece count is not required unless
     the materiel is classified, sensitive, hazardous, pilferable, high-value (see Attachment 1),
     999/NMCS/MICAP, or it is obvious the count is different from what is documented. Serial
     numbers must be validated, when visible and accessible. However, in-checkers retain
     authority to open any boxes offered for shipment to inspect for nature of cargo, safety,
     contrabands and serviceability of the cargo. When inspection is verified, in-checker signs the
     shipping document and provides a signed copy to the customer. Use an electronic signature
     for materiel where the capability exists, i.e., CMOS or the Supply Asset Tracking System.
     3.1.2. Non-MILSTRIP Shipments. Non-MILSTRIP shipments are those presented to the TO
     for shipment that are not processed through the base level supply system. Normally, the
     organization requesting shipment is responsible to deliver their cargo to the Cargo Movement
     staging area. Shipment planners may use DD Form 1149, DD Form 250, or a memorandum
     from the unit to process non-MILSTRIP shipments. Shipment Transportation Priority (TP)
     will be assigned based on customers‘ required delivery date. Customers must provide a
     realistic required delivery date to final destination. Shipment processing time starts when an
     activity offers a shipment to the Cargo Movement Element for shipping. Shipments that are
     pre-packaged by the shipper can be accepted by the TO without an additional piece count as
     long as the shipping documentation includes the statement ―Customer Provided Piece
     Count.‖
        3.1.2.1. When DD Form 1149 is used, all shippers, including Guard and Reserve, must
        use the automated DD 1149 System, hosted on the website provided at the end of this
        paragraph.    All shippers currently using an automated management system to create
        shipping documents may continue to do so (e.g. PMEL and engine managers).
        Attachment 2 provides manual DD Form 1149 instructions for users without computer
        access. DD1149: https://lsotools.wpafb.af.mil/dd1149/. If the web DD Form 1149
        process cannot accurately produce the required information, a manual 1149 is acceptable.
        3.1.2.2. Review and comply with carrier selection criteria contained in Paragraph 2.5.
        Commercial air or expedited ground service modes/methods will be selected when the
        cost is equal to or less than the normal surface cost.
        3.1.2.3. Review and comply with shipment clearance procedures contained in Paragraph
        3.4. TOs must submit the ATCMD data to the ACA and receive confirmation prior to
        release of the material to the port.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                 31


      3.1.2.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Unit commanders must provide a memorandum
      to Cargo Movement Outbound (49 LRS/LGRDDC-O) annotating personnel authorized to
      effect a shipment using the DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document.
      A copy of the appointment memorandum will be maintained by LGRDDC-O for
      reference and validation prior to acceptance and shipment.
      3.1.2.5. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Units/personnel shipping stock listed assets
      (items with a National Stock Number assigned) on the DD Form 1149 must complete the
      DD Form 1149 Checklist, found on 49 LRS/LGRD‘s SharePoint site using this link,
      https://holloman.eim.acc.af.mil/49_MSG/49_LRS/LGRD/LGRDDC/Cargo%20Mov
      ement%20Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx. Coordinate the shipment
      through Material Management Customer Support Section (49 LRS/LGRMC), prior to
      offering the shipment to LGRDDC-O.
3.2. Assigning Transportation Priority.
   3.2.1. MILSTRIP Shipments. Use Table 3.1. to assign the correct Transportation Priority
   and determine shipment options.
       32                                          AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012

      Note 1: RDD 999 identifies shipments having the most urgent need. It is assigned to NMCS materiel
      with a supply priority designator of 01-03, and consigned to U.S. Forces overseas and CONUS forces
      alerted for deployment within 30 days of the requisition date. RDD 999 may not be applied to FMS,
      Military Assistance Program grant aid, or to retrograde movements. EXCEPTION: Retrograde aircraft
      engines will have an RDD of 999.

      Note 2: RDD 777 with one of the Air Force Expedited project codes (Paragraph 2.3.) should be moved by
      express service when eligible. Use AMC or fastest available means when not eligible for express service.
      A list of current US Air Force Project Codes and Nicknames can be accessed on the AFMC/A4 web site
      at https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/projectcodes/
            3.2.2. Non-MILSTRIP Shipments: See Table 3.2. Assign Transportation Priority for non-
            MILSTRIP Shipments based on the shippers required RDD. See Paragraph 2.4.2.1.for

       Note 1: * Shippers must provide justification when requesting expedited transportation.
       Justification will include signature of a competent authority (e.g., Squadron Commander). This
       may be included on the DD Form 1149, or attached memorandum. The TO may waive this
       requirement in repetitive or other justifiable customer situations. Items subject to airlift
       challenge as shown in Paragraph 11.3.3.1. should typically not be assigned RDD 999.
       Note 2: RDD 999 is assigned for air eligible items that are in non-mission capable status, or are
       essential to support/repair non-mission capable status assets. Examples of shipments typically

assigned a RDD of 999 would include lateral support for a weapons system, parts for a broken
fire truck, and similar cases.
3.3. Shipment Planning. Shipment planners determine best value mode/method and select the
carrier to move the materiel to destination consistent with the delivery requirement. The
shipment planner must consider all of the following:
      3.3.1. Shipment identification. Check commodity characteristics.
      3.3.2. Transportation Priority. See Paragraph 3.2.
      3.3.3. Consignee location and receiving capability. Consult the SDDC on-line web TFG at
      https://eta.sddc.army.mil.
      3.3.4. Consignee DOD Activity Address Code (DODAAC) and clear-text address. A
      DODAAC is a 6-position code that identifies a unit‘s mailing, shipping, and billing addresses
      used for requisitioning and shipping material. Air Force DODAACs begin with the letters
      ―E‖, ―F‖, or ―J.‖ For specific DODAAC information, refer to https://dodaac.wpafb.af.mil.
      If the consignee does not have an assigned DODAAC, the non-specific DODAAC F00000 (F
      plus five zeros) is used. The clear text address of the consignee must then be entered on the
      TCMD as trailer data. If it is a CONUS shipment and does not have a TCMD, the shipper
      will ensure the complete clear-text address is included on the shipping documents.
      3.3.5. Mode/Method. Shipment planners must comply with Paragraph 2.4.
      3.3.6. Movement time standards. See Paragraph 2.3., Table 2.1. and DOD 4140.1-R.
      3.3.7. Special handling needs. See Chapter 4 and Chapter 5.
      3.3.8. Shipment funding and Transportation Account Code (TAC) or fund cite assignment.
      See Chapter 7.
      3.3.9. CONUS - Appropriate National Motor Freight Classification (NMFC) number and
      commodity code. Refer to current SDDC Unified Rules Publication
      (http://www.sddc.army.mil/public/Global+Cargo+Distribution/). The NMFC number is
      in Block 6 and type cargo code used with the NMFC number is in Block 8 of the DD Form
      1348-1A.
      3.3.10. If shipment requires clearance into an air or water terminal for DTS movement, see
      Paragraph 3.4. for Air Force clearance requirements. Also see DTR Part II, Paragraph 203-
      B19 for additional information.
      3.3.11. International Shipments. See Paragraph 2.6.
         3.3.11.1. ―Customs Only‖ GBL for shipments to Korea. See Paragraph 6.2.4. This does
         not apply to FMS shipments.
         3.3.11.2. See Paragraph 6.2.5. for shipments to Canada.
         3.3.11.3. OCONUS to CONUS shipments using unit/base O&M funds. OCONUS
         shipping activities must complete the ATCMD to include a miscellaneous trailer data
         record (T_9) with the Standard Document Number (SDN) and Line of Accounting (LOA)
         on all shipments moving under unit/base O&M funds. See Paragraph 7.2.5. for
         additional information, particularly pertaining to obtaining a unit TAC for movement
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                      35


     provided by AMC/SDDC (airlift/sealift). AMC CONUS aerial ports will use the SDN
     and LOA for onward CONUS movement using the CBL payment process under TPPS.
     On the first T_9 line enter the letters "SDN" followed by the data. Next enter letters
     "LOA: followed by data. Use as many T_9's as necessary. Enter a sequence number
     beginning with one for each T_9 entry.
  3.3.12. Selection of Best Value Carrier. See Paragraph 2.5. and Attachment 1, Terms.
  3.3.13. Movement by United States Postal Service (USPS). Make mail movements
  according to DOD 4525.8-M/AF Supplement 1, DOD Official Mail Manual. TOs should
  consider use of USPS as they would any other authorized carrier. Absence of ITV
  capabilities may constrain the use of this method for movement. Before using USPS, check
  with your postal representative for availability of ITV service. See Paragraph 5.3.2. for use
  of USPS for movement of small quantities of small arms and sensitive/protected cargo.
  3.3.14. Ensure a TCN is assigned to every shipment. TCN guidance can be found in DTR
  Part II, Appendix L (http://www.transcom.mil/j5/pt/dtrpart2/dtr_part_ii_app_l.pdf).
  Use the following TCN guidance for non-MILSTRIP shipments.
     3.3.14.1. TCNs for non-MILSTRIP Shipments: Place a record of the transaction into
     your locally developed TCN system. The TCN register can be generated in CMOS as
     required. The information should include but is not limited to the following:
         3.3.14.1.1. Date--Julian
         3.3.14.1.2. TCN--17 digit alphanumeric code constructed according to DTR, Part II.
         3.3.14.1.3. RDD--A calendar date that specifies when materiel is actually required to
         be delivered to the requisitioner. The RDD field may contain 999, N--, E--, 555 or
         777 to indicate expedited handling required. A blank RDD field indicates routine
         handling. RDD 444 is used for collocated stock and does not require the fastest
         possible service of the supply and transportation system.
         3.3.14.1.4. From--The activity offering the materiel for shipment.
         3.3.14.1.5. To--DODAAC of the Consignee or the "in-the-clear-" address of the
         recipient. See Note 1.
         3.3.14.1.6. Mode--Mode code taken from DTR, Part II
         3.3.14.1.7. Remarks--Example name and phone number of person and activity

NOTE: OCONUS small package contract carrier services shipments must reflect the international
foreign postal code (zip) of the consignee. For assistance, see the following website:
http://www.bitboost.com/ref/international-address-formats.html#Formats
      3.3.15. Shipment Consolidation. Consolidate shipments to the maximum extent possible,
      consistent with delivery requirements, time standards, and DTR direction.
         3.3.15.1. Consolidate shipments using the following criteria:
             3.3.15.1.1. Do not consolidate serviceable and unserviceable materiel.
             3.3.15.1.2. Must have the same TAC or fund citation.
             3.3.15.1.3. Must be compatible with other materiel.
             3.3.15.1.4. Must be consigned to the same ultimate consignee.
             3.3.15.1.5. Must not impact commercial express movement eligibility.
             3.3.15.1.6. Do not consolidate different project codes.
         3.3.15.2. Consolidated 999/NMCS/MICAP shipments must meet the following
         additional conditions.
             3.3.15.2.1. No delay in movement occurs for any item.
             3.3.15.2.2. Must maintain ITV over each TCN.
         3.3.15.3. FMS Consolidation. The following conditions apply to FMS in addition to the
         above:
             3.3.15.3.1. Have the same U.S. Service Code.
             3.3.15.3.2. Must be the same recipient country.
             3.3.15.3.3. Must have the same mark-for/ship-to/freight forwarder location.
             3.3.15.3.4. Must have the same FMS case designator.
             3.3.15.3.5. Must have the same Delivery Term Code (DTC).
3.4. Shipment Clearance Requirements.
      3.4.1. CONUS Clearance Requirements. The TO must clear shipments moving on military
      owned or arranged airlift and sealift through the appropriate clearance agency prior to
      movement to the aerial or water port of embarkation (APOE or WPOE). See Paragraph
      3.4.1.1.2. for airlift clearance exceptions and Paragraph 3.4.4.1. for sealift clearance
      exceptions. Refer to the DTR, Part II, for the appropriate air and water clearance authorities.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                      37


     3.4.1.1. 635 SCMWWPOL/ACO, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, plans and executes the
     Air Force ACA functions for CONUS originating shipments planned for AMC channel
     lift to overseas points. Operational functions are delegated to the two regional ACA
     Shipper Service Liaison Offices (SSLO) co-located with AMC at Dover AFB, DE,
     (ACA-East) and Travis AFB, CA, (ACA-West). The responsibilities of the SSLO
     include but are not limited to coordinating movement to the APOE with both shipper and
     project managers; maintaining visibility over cleared air and surface cargo; providing
     shipment status to tracer requests; assisting in the resolution of cargo discrepancies;
     enforcing SDT savings programs such as air challenges; use of deferred airfreight and
     performing cargo pre-clearance for shipments requiring special handling. Shipments that
     are not properly cleared through the SSLO, diversion to surface transportation or turn-in
     to a Defense Reutilization Management Office could occur. See DTR, Part II, Appendix
     R, for the SSLO hours of operation.
        3.4.1.1.1. Use the fastest means available when transmitting the ATCMD to the
        appropriate SSLO. Air Force Bases will use CMOS to clear shipments. If no other
        automated means are available or if CMOS is down, shippers will use website (
        https://lsotools.wpafb.af.mil/atcmd/) to submit ATCMDs electronically.
        3.4.1.1.2. The following exceptions require that the shipper fax an ATCMD to the
        ACA prior to releasing the shipment unless the shipper is using the website ATCMD
        form in instances cited below. If the website is not being used for cargo clearance,
        then ALL of the shipments listed below must be faxed to the ACA.
            3.4.1.1.2.1. Explosives. Shipments of explosives may be subject to an explosive
            clearance number, which the ACA must obtain for the shipper prior to release of
            shipment. Annotate explosive clearance numbers on the Military Shipping Label.
            Web users clearing explosives will receive a screen message to hold the shipment
            until contacted by the ACA.
            3.4.1.1.2.2. Dog Shipments (military working dogs with handler). The ATCMD
            will include the dog's name, ID tag number, type of dog (i.e., drug, explosive,
            patrol), and handler's name and rank. Also, indicate on the trailer records how the
            dog and handler will arrive at the aerial port (commercial flight number). Dog
            shipments must be spaced blocked through AMC by the shipping activity.
            Website users will be prompted to enter the mission number on which the dog and
            handler are space blocked. For CMOS users, enter the mission number on a T_9
            line. As long as all the above information is entered to the ATCMD web form,
            the shipment is cleared for airlift. Guidance to space block through AMC can be
            found in AMCI 24-101, Vol 9, para 13.5:
            http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AMCI24-101V9.pdf.
            3.4.1.1.2.3. Courier shipments. Include name and rank of courier(s). As long as
            all the required information is entered to the ATCMD web form, the shipment is
            cleared for airlift.
            3.4.1.1.2.4. Ration shipments may be cleared through the ATCMD web form as
            long as trailer records identify icing and other special handling requirements.
            3.4.1.1.2.5. Blood medical emergency shipments must be faxed to the ACA.
 38                                          AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


                3.4.1.1.2.6. Household goods shipments to other than hardlift areas with message
                of approval from JPPSO-SAT must be faxed to the ACA, unless being cleared as
                deferred airfreight/TP-4.
             3.4.1.1.3. For AMC airlift, send the ATCMD to the appropriate CONUS service
             ACA or OCONUS designated theater ACA via e-mail or fax. The preferred method
             is by electronic transmission. See DTR, Part II, and OCONUS MAJCOM guidance.
             The LSO website listed in Paragraph 3.4.1.1.1. may be used to clear shipments
             through the USAFE ACAs.
             3.4.1.1.4. For CONUS export sealift, send the ATCMD to SDDC Operations Center,
             Ocean Cargo Clearance Authority (OCCA) booking office located at Fort Eustis, VA.
             For OCONUS sealift requirements send to the appropriate Theater CDR designated
             Water Clearance Authority (WCA). Use the SDDC provided Integrated Booking
             System software or submit on DD Form 1086, Export Traffic Release Request. The
             preferred method is by electronic transmission.
      3.4.2. Clearance of Shipments into CONUS Military Air Terminals. The TO requests ACA
      clearance of cargo planned for AMC channel airlift prior to cargo release to the APOE. To
      request a clearance, submit the ATCMD data to the sponsoring service ACA. DTR, Part II
      contains specific clearance instructions.
         3.4.2.1. The    Air Force ACA clears or challenges the request for air movement. The
         requisitioner   has up to two calendar days to justify airlift of challenged shipments. The
         shipping TO     will hold the shipment pending the challenge decision by the ACA. In the
         event airlift   justification is insufficient, the TO will divert the shipment to surface
         movement.
3.4.2.2. Air Force sponsored TP-1 and TP-2 shipments are airlift eligible. TP-3 is not air
eligible, except for short expiration date items (see Paragraph 2.4.2.). The most current airlift
eligibility and challenge procedures are accessed from the 591 SCMG website:

Library >> Policy >> Airlift Policy. See Paragraph 11.3. for the airlift eligibility and challenge
procedures at time of publication of this AFI
      3.4.3. Clearance of Shipments into OCONUS Military Air Terminals. The TO requests
      ACA clearance of cargo planned for movement from or within an overseas area via AMC
      prior to release of the materiel to the port. Furnish ATCMD data to the ACA designated by
      the overseas theater MAJCOM for acceptance decision. DTR, Part II, and MAJCOM
      procedures provide ACA responsibilities and guidance governing clearance of shipments into
      air terminals.
      3.4.4. Clearance of Shipments into CONUS Designated Water Terminals. The TO requests
      WCA clearance of cargo planned for direct delivery to a WPOE prior to movement of the
      materiel. WCA clears cargo offered for export from the CONUS ports. DTR, Part II,
      contains procedures for shipment clearance into water terminals.
         3.4.4.1. When sealift eligible cargo is not sufficient enough for container or flatrack
         loading at origin, send to a Consolidation and Containerization Point (CCP) for those
         shipments that qualify. These shipments are exempt from the normal sealift clearance
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                         39


       process. DLA operates a CCP on the East and West Coast of the United States. The East
       Coast CCP is the Defense Distribution Depot Susquehanna, New Cumberland, PA,
       (DDSP-W25N14). The West Coast CCP is co-located with the Defense Distribution
       Depot San Joaquin, Tracy, CA, (DDJC-W62N2A). The DODAAD, identifies by
       DODAAC, those destinations served by each of the CCPs. The DTR, Part II, contains
       CCP procedures.
   3.4.5. Clearance of Shipments into OCONUS Designated Water Terminals. The TO
   requests WCA or OCCA clearance on all cargo planned for movement from or within an
   overseas area via MSC. Clearance procedures are in DTR, Part II.
3.5. Green Sheet Procedures. Judicious application of Green Sheet procedures is essential to
preserve the effectiveness of its intent. This is a process where specifically identified cargo in
the AMC system may gain movement precedence over other priority cargo of the sponsoring
Service, including 999 shipments. Use it when expedited movement of specific shipments is in
the national interest, and the ACA certifies that it as an operational necessity. Green Sheet
applies to the final destination APOD.
   3.5.1. Air Force CONUS activities submit AMC airlift export requests to the ACA, Wright
   Patterson AFB, OH (refer to Paragraph 3.4.1.1.), and overseas activities submit to the
   designated theater ACA. The ACA is the only activity authorized to levy Green Sheet action
   with the aerial port. Blanket application for Green Sheet action is not authorized. HQ AMC
   must have Green Sheet procedures in place at all aerial ports.
   3.5.2. Green Sheet requests must include TCN, pieces, weight, cube, consignee DODAAC,
   APOE/APOD and valid reason for Green Sheet action (i.e., aircraft down, work stoppage).
   Vague statements such as ―urgently required‖ are not sufficient to warrant Green Sheet
   action. Customers must be specific regarding their urgency of need. The Green Sheet
   request memorandum must be signed by an O-6 or above.
   3.5.3. Upon approval, the CONUS ACA will send the approved Green Sheet Request to the
   Customer Support Branch (CSB) at the CONUS aerial ports, who will complete AMC Form
   101, Green Sheet Request. At the OCONUS aerial ports, the ACA will provide the
   completed AMC Form 101 to the Air Terminal Operations Officer (ATOC).
   3.5.4. AMC will assure airlift policy supports timely processing of Green Sheet Requests
   and provides coverage through the final APOD.
   3.5.5. DELETED
3.6. Purple Sheet Procedures. The Purple Sheet process authorizes specifically identified
cargo in the AMC system in transit to the Combatant Command (COCOM) area of responsibility
(AOR) to gain movement precedence over other priority cargo in transit to the COCOM AOR,
including 999 and Green Sheet shipments, regardless of service lane or arrival date at the APOE.
The COCOM requires the ability to prioritize sustainment cargo during Lines of Communication
(LOC) stress or during shifts of contingency/combat operations. The intent is to outline a
process for the supported combat command to prioritize sustainment cargo already on hand at an
APOE for subsequent flow into the COCOM area of responsibility per the Defense
Transportation Regulation, Part III, Chapter 304.2a(3). The COCOM utilizes Purple Sheeting to
expedite movement of specific shipment(s) of national interest and operational necessity. Purple
Sheet applies from initial identification to the shipment‘s final destination APOD.
 40                                         AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


      3.6.1. The COCOM J4 approves Purple Sheet request and forwards to COCOM Deployment
      Distribution Operations Center (CDDOC). CDDOC will forward after coordination to the
      US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Deployment Distribution Operation Center
      (DDOC). The DDOC tasks the 618 Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC), who in turn tasks
      the applicable Aerial Port (APOE). The Aerial Port APOE will info the service Airlift
      Clearance Authority (ACA). No blanket shipment or plane load Purple Sheet request will be
      approved.
      3.6.2. Aerial Port procedures. The only authorized Purple Sheeting authority to the Aerial
      Ports will be the 618 TACC. Once the Aerial Port is tasked by the TACC the following
      actions will occur:
         3.6.2.1. The Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC) coordinates the request with the
         applicable work centers (i.e., Load Planning, Capability Forecasting, or Air Freight) to
         confirm that the cargo is on hand at the APOE and movement ready.
         3.6.2.2. ATOC notifies the service ACA or Customer Service Branch (CSB) for CONUS
         ports of Purple Sheet cargo.
         3.6.2.3. If applicable the CSB or ACA changes the priority and RDD fields in the Global
         Air Transportation Execution System (GATES) to read ―1‖ ―999‖ and enter the words
         ―Purple Sheet as of XXXXZ‖ in the applicable trailer (TX1) data fields. If no CSB or
         ACA assistance is available, ATOC will direct the Air Freight section to accomplish the
         system changes. Since no special priority code exists for Purple Sheet cargo, adding the
         information to the trailer data fields above is key to identifying the cargo as Purple Sheet
         for ITV purposes.
         3.6.2.4. Stage loose shipments in a specific warehouse location for ramp services or task
         the Special Handling work center to upload. These shipments are high-visibility, so it is
         imperative that the Aerial Port leadership ensures expeditious and well-coordinated
         movement.
         3.6.2.5. Plan movement on the first available mission. Purple Sheet cargo will not
         displace cargo already manifested on departing aircraft, unless directed by TACC.
         3.6.2.6. Manifest Purple Sheeted cargo separately with markings ―Purple Sheet Cargo.‖
         3.6.2.7. Every effort will be made to release the cargo at its end destination as swiftly as
         possible upon aircraft arrival.
3.7. Purchase of additional liability coverage or excess valuation. The following steps
should be considered when deciding on the purchase of additional cargo liability coverage or
excess valuation on individual shipment units (also see paragraph 2.8):
      3.7.1. Identify commodity type and value of the shipment unit.
      3.7.2. Compare to the maximum liability or valuation coverage offered by the carrier‘s
      contract, tariff or tender, without paying accessorial charges for added coverage.
      3.7.3. Determine the shipment cost difference with and without increased liability or excess
      valuation coverage.
      3.7.4. Consider cost of purchasing or increasing the level of protective service versus
      purchasing increased coverage.

   3.7.5. Consider your selected best value carrier‘s track record on loss/damage.
3.8. Same Day Service (SDS) criteria. Prior to utilizing SDS, all other movement methods
required for expedited movement will be explored. SDS will not be considered as a normal
means for movement and considered only as an exception to next day service and only used in
dire circumstances (i.e. mission failure). SDS moves via scheduled commercial air carriers and
does not include guaranteed arrival time. Weight/size limits and other restrictions such as
destination, additional charges, etc. will vary per carrier and must be verified and agreed upon
prior to pick up. Shipping customers will provide a destination contact name, commercial and/or
DSN contact number and an in-the-clear address for the consignee before the shipment is
accepted by the TO for transport. Use of SDS constitutes the consignee must be available at the
time of delivery to accept the shipment. Use of this service does not preclude the carrier from
having an approved HQ AMC tender on file or HQ AMC approval for a one-time rate quote.
For exceptions, see DTR, Part II. The following criteria must be met for use of SDS and base
TO makes the final decision.
   3.8.1. Shipment must have an Agile Logistics Project Code or an RDD of 999, N_ or E_.
   3.8.2. SDS cannot be used if actual use of the item will not occur before normal next day
   delivery service. Exception: Shipments delivered to an aerial port for an overseas AMC
   flight.
   3.8.3. The individual requesting SDS must provide written or email justification to the origin
   TO from a 0-6 or equivalent to verify urgency of movement. This may be delegated to the
   senior duty officer if 0-6 signature cannot be obtained to meet critical mission requirements.
   Supporting documentation will include a brief justification, named consignee, required
   delivery date and signature block. Blanket requests are not authorized.
   3.8.4. The TO will maintain one copy of the justification with the shipping document and
   one copy will be included with the shipment packing list.
   3.8.5. TO/Designated TA must certify (see Figure 3.1) that all services were performed,
   retain a file copy with shipping documentation and forward a copy of the certificate to the
   requesting organization.

3.9. Express Carrier Shipment Documentation. The TCN must be entered in the shipper
reference field (17 positions) on the commercial bill of lading to provide ITV. The following
additional procedures will be used for TPB purposes:
      3.9.1. TCNs are automatically entered at CMOS sites using the standard Industry
      Information Processor (I2P) capability. I2P is described in Attachment 1.
      3.9.2. The TCN on the carrier waybill alerts the carrier tracking system to forward shipment
      information to DOD in transit visibility systems as well as allow for TCN tracking using the
      commercial carrier‘s tracking system. The TCN links express carrier and shipper
      information systems and provides data for pipeline analysis.
      3.9.3. The billing TAC in the reference field will help track billing information and ensure
      invoices are sent to the correct paying office.
      3.9.4. For non-I2P transactions, enter the TCN in the first 17 positions of the field, enter one
      space, and then enter the TAC in positions 19-22. Spaces, other than the one between the
      TCN and TAC or additional characters not part of the TCN or TAC, should not be included.
      Data must be entered in this order either by using carrier-provided software or filling out the
      air waybill manually.        An example of a correctly entered TCN and TAC:
      FB483382120189XXX F2RS (ensuring one blank space between ―XXX‖ and ―TAC‖).

        3.11.4.4.1. Items that are to be installed equipment on real property (RPIE) will not
        be processed by central receiving. This materiel will be delivered to/accepted by the
        facility custodian or project manager and accountability will be maintained on RPIE
        records.
        3.11.4.4.2. The CA/CRL custodian is responsible for notifying Receiving that
        materiel has been received when the items by-pass Receiving. A copy of the receipt
        document must be provided and the receipt/DOR will be processed to establish
        accountability.
        3.11.4.4.3. When CA/CRL accountable materiel is received requiring contractor
        installation and an installation delay is expected, accountable processing must be
        coordinated with the equipment custodian and the equipment management function.

     inspector to assure that the shelf life data reflected on the tag/label and paperwork are
     correct.
        3.11.4.6.1. Items Not Required. If the item is NOT required at the off-base location,
        the off-base representative will write ITEM NOT REQUIRED on the receiving
        document and forward the property and document to the computer support base (host)
        for processing.
        3.11.4.6.2. Items Required. The LRS/Accountable Officer at the host will direct one
        of the following options for processing items needed at the off-base location:
        3.11.4.6.3. Option 1. The organization representative must sign the receiving
        document (in block 22 of the DD Form 250, or block 27 of the DD Form 1348-1A, or
        line 28 of the computer generated DD Form 1348-1A) and cross reference the receipt
        to the due-out document number that it will satisfy. Once the receiving documents are
        cross-referenced and signed, forward them to the computer support base for
        processing.
            3.11.4.6.3.1. . Cross Reference Receipt to Due-Out Document Number. To
            simplify processing at the computer support base, Block 27 of the DD Form 1348-
            1A will be used to record the due-out document number being satisfied by the
            receipt. If multiple line items are involved, the due-out number may be recorded
            directly below the receiving document line item number or on a cross-reference
            listing attached to the receiving document.
            3.11.4.6.3.2. Host Base Responsibilities. Receiving personnel at the computer
            support base will prepare the receipt inputs. Receiving will enter TEX code Y in
            position 51 and the due-out document number in positions 60-73 of the receipt
            input. Receiving will then process the document and forward it to Customer
            Support.
            3.11.4.6.3.3. Option 2. When materiel arrives, off-base personnel will notify host
            base Receiving personnel by telephone or message. The following information
            will be provided so the receipt can be processed: Stock number of item received,
            Quantity shipped, Quantity received, Requisition number, and Organization due-
            out document number if release of a specific due-out is desired.
        3.11.4.6.4. Host Base Responsibilities. Receiving personnel at the host base will
        prepare and process a receipt input with TEX code Y in position 51 and the

           informal log that will contain the information above and the date each receipt was
           processed.
           3.11.4.6.5. Verifying the Documentation. Off-base personnel will immediately
           forward the receiving document to the host base receiving function for verification.
           After verifying this document against the log and ensuring the document contains all
           necessary entries, Receiving will forward the receipt documentation to Customer
           Support. NOTE: All of the above steps must be processed promptly. Delinquent
           documents must be avoided and computer records must be kept up-to-date.
       3.11.4.7. Warranty/Guaranty and Contract Repair Services. Items under warranty or
       guaranty are identified on the containers, as required in MIL-STD 129P.
       Warranty/Guaranty items will be processed as specified in TO 00-35D-54. Receiving
       personnel will ensure that all documentation and markings on warranty/guaranty items
       are perpetuated. Exact procedures and checklists to ensure warranties/guaranties are fully
       utilized will be locally developed.
       3.11.4.8. When the Receiving Section receipts for cargo from carriers for base, tenant or
       contractor organizations, the items will be turned over to Documented Cargo Operations
       in a timely manner for receipt to the ultimate consignees. If Documented Cargo
       Operations is not used or unavailable, ultimate consignees are responsible to pick up their
       shipments in accordance with time standards shown in Table 3.3. below. Receiving
       personnel will annotate on the receiving document the date, time and name of the person
       contacted for pick-up.         Capability and resources permitting, Deployment and
       Distribution personnel will develop local procedures to assist consignees in this process.

                                           Chapter 4

                             HAZARDOUS MATERIALS (HM)

4.1. Hazardous Materials Definition. For the purposes of this AFI, hazardous materials are
substances or materials that the UN or DOT has determined are capable of posing an
unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property during transportation.
4.2. General Requirements. Traffic Management personnel must comply with public law,
policy, agreements, and applicable international, federal, and military directives when packaging,
processing, handling, shipping, and receiving HM. Personnel who certify, prepare, handle,
inspect and receive HM for shipment must be trained in the safe handling/processing of HM and
ensure PPE is used. For hazardous cargo movement and certification use the appropriate
AFMAN 24-204_IP, 49 CFR PARTS 100-199, IMDG, IATA or ICAO directive based on modal
selection and final destination. Violations of these directives could result in civil and criminal
penalties or undue safety risks to the general population. Hazardous substance shipments must
comply with the same DOT and military regulations required for any other HM. Overseas
shippers moving HM to, from, and within a foreign country must also comply with foreign
country directives, applicable international requirements and DECA/SOFA. Shippers are also
required to develop and maintain/update security plans as required. Personnel associated with
packaging, transportation and receiving of hazardous materials must receive security training
IAW DTR, PART II, Chapter 204.
   4.2.1. Special Reporting Requirements. 49 CFR, paragraph 172.101, identifies hazardous
   substances and their reportable quantities. TOs must comply with special reporting
   requirements if there is a release of a reportable quantity of a hazardous substance. See 49
   CFR, paragraphs 171.15. and 171.16.
4.3. Hazardous Materials Procedures. Follow the Federal, agency, or departmental
documents regulating the mode of transportation. The Hazardous Materials Information
Resource System (HMIRS) provides guidance to personnel responsible for the handling of
hazardous materials. Use HMIRS as a complementary reference along with, and not as a
replacement for, existing regulations.    HMIRS is available on the internet at
http://www.dlis.dla.mil/hmirs.
   4.3.1. Labeling Hazardous Materials. Apply the proper hazard label to the outside of the
   shipping container according to AFMAN 24-204_IP, ICAO, IATA, IMDGand 49 CFR.
   AFOSH Standard 48-12, paragraph 5d, identifies the labeling required by the OSHA Hazard
   Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.4.
   4.3.2. Shipper Certification. International, federal, and military regulations require the
   shipper to certify that hazardous materials are properly identified, described, packaged,
   marked, labeled, and in proper condition for transportation. This includes hazardous
   material government purchase card micropurchase car shipments. . Depending on the
   mode/ method or whether the shipment moves by commercial or by military transportation,
   the specific language may vary and specific forms may be prescribed. Shippers are reminded
   that when transporting hazardous waste, hazardous waste manifests are required as well as
   appropriate EPA generator and transporter identification numbers.
 52                                          AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


      4.3.3. Preparing Aircraft/Vehicle/AGE Fuel Devices for Shipment. Drain and purge
      aircraft/vehicle/AGE fuel equipment IAW T.O. procedures prior to shipment. Items shall not
      be accepted (inducted) into supply or transportation without documented proof (AFTO Form
      20, Caution Tag, or other locally produced documentation) certifying that the equipment has
      been properly drained and purged. Purging for transportation is only required if the
      applicable T.O. requires it, or items that are containerized and not accessible in flight with a
      flash point below 100 degrees per AFMAN 24-204_IP( http://www.e-
      publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN24-204_IP.pdf). Ensure the following
      conditions are met before offering aircraft/vehicle/AGE fuel devices for commercial and
      military transportation (air or surface):
         4.3.3.1. Ensure strict compliance with Tech Order procedures for draining and purging
         the fuel parts. Remove all excess purging fluid as required and ensure the part is
         completely cleaned. Annotate on the documentation ―drained and purged‖ or ―drained
         and not purged.‖ Include residue type (e.g. JP8) and volume remaining.
         4.3.3.2. The AFTO Form 20 (or other documentation) must be signed (include printed
         full name) in the appropriate block or by the inspection stamp by personnel
         accomplishing the draining and purging procedures.
         4.3.3.3. Cover plates will not be placed on openings until the documentation is
         completed. Then properly cap and seal drain openings, open lines and fittings as
         specified in the item Tech Order.
         4.3.3.4. LRS/APS Materiel Management Flight and the TO must ensure documentation
         is attached to the item(s), checked for completeness and signed (certifying the item is
         drained and purged) prior to turn-in. If hazards are suspected, frustrate the shipment and
         coordinate with appropriate maintenance, vehicle or fuels personnel to resolve. Only
         qualified technicians on the equipment in question will perform the required procedures
         to prepare equipment for shipment.
         4.3.3.5. If the T.O. data covering the parts/equipment does not require drain and/or purge
         procedures prior to shipping, then these parts do not require documented proof. This
         includes but is not limited to aircraft parts and aerospace ground equipment (AGE)
         containing hydraulic fluids, oils and lubricants (fluids non-hazardous for transportation).
         Certain aircraft parts received from Supply have fluid in them and are ready for
         installation on the aircraft. These fluids are essential for parts to operate.
         4.3.3.6. Any item containing residual fluid (fuel) must be packed in a greaseproof,
         waterproof sealed bag (MIL-DTL-117). Use of a proper barrier bag will prevent contact
         of residual fuel with the outer container and reduce petroleum odors. If reusing
         packaging, inspect for presence of residue or stains. If the packaging is stained from a
         petroleum product, do not reuse.
         4.3.3.7. Mark each outer container with the type of material and flash point for the
         purging fluid. This will help identify that odors are from non-regulated purging fluid and
         not from a hazardous material (flammable fuel).
4.4. Management of Hazardous Material Data. Packaging offices at each PRIME AFGLSC
must complete transportation material safety data sheets for all Air Force hazardous items they
manage. Assistance can be provided by contacting the Air Force Institute for Environment,
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                               53

Controlled Cryptographic Items (CCI); AFI 20-110, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel
Management and MIL-STD-l29, Standard Practice for Military Marking. All classified and
unclassified NWRM will be handled and shipped as classified, protected cargo. The TO will
ensure complete documentation is processed and completed as follows:
      5.1.1. Ensure each DD Form 1348-1A issued for the shipment of classified, sensitive, and
      some controlled items shows the word "CLASSIFIED" or "SENSITIVE" followed by the
      applicable supply controlled item code. The DD Form 1348-1A will be accompanied by a
      printed serial number listing when items exceed printable numbers on the form itself.
      NWRM DD Form 1348-1A will be stamped with the statement ―Classified NWRM Item‖ or
      ―Unclassified NWRM Item‖ in red ink. The DD Form 1348-1A, Issue/Receipt Document is
      the only shipment document authorized for shipping NWRM. NOTE: The DD Form 1149 is
      authorized when necessary to meet Department of Energy (DOE) requirements. The
      document will be stamped as above.
         5.1.1.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Category II, III, and IV small arms and light
         weapon shipments will not be shipped using the DD Form 1149. They include handguns,
         rifle, carbines, sub-machine guns, machine guns, grenade launchers, portable anti-aircraft
         guns, portable anti-tank guns, recoilless rifles, man-portable launchers of missile/rocket
         systems and mortars.
         5.1.1.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) All units/personnel that offer for shipment
         AA&E, classified, sensitive, hazardous, and other protected items, will ensure the asset is
         properly identified on the shipping documents (DD Form 1348-1A and/or DD Form
         1149). Additionally, for classified assets, the DD1348-1As/1149s will include
         applicable Controlled Inventory Item Code/Serialized Report Code and must be marked,
         in RED identifying the degree of classification, such as ―SECRET ITEM,‖
         ―CONFIDENTIAL ITEM,‖ or ―CCI ITEM‖ to ensure easy identification).
      5.1.2. Use extra copies of the DD Form 1348-1A as a hand receipt in processing SECRET
      and SENSITIVE shipments prior to packaging. The DD Form 1149 serves as a hand receipt
      for non-MILSTRIP shipments.
      5.1.3. Provide hand-to-hand receipt control for NWRM, classified, sensitive, and controlled
      shipments. The DD Form 1907, Signature and Tally Record, may be used for all receipt
      transactions. The TO may use the DD Form 1907 as a hand-to-hand receipt for internal
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                       57


  control of classified or sensitive items. Equivalent carrier-furnished forms may be used as
  described in the DTR, Part II. The air/truck manifest may be used for military shipments if
  they adequately control the materiel being transferred. DD Form 1907 or carrier-furnished
  forms are not required for all movements via Domestic Express Small Package Service
  (DESPS) to include NWRM. Hand receipt documents will be retained in customer support,
  and disposition will be in accordance with AFRIMS (https://afrims.amc.af.mil/).
     5.1.3.1. If Asset Management (AM) is not used, the DD Form 1348-1A is used as the
     hand receipt document for processing sensitive items between receiving and storage. An
     extra set of forms is produced for each sensitive item and the unused copies are placed in
     the number 1 shipping container for use by the receiving function. A signature block is
     provided.
  5.1.4. Shipments of classified material to the FMS purchaser are normally handled through
  DTS. However, if the FMS freight forwarder or a country-arranged pilot or vessel pick-up at
  the POE is indicated, obtain a copy of the country's Transportation Plan detailing the
  approved method of transportation. The Transportation Plan can be obtained from the Air
  Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) Command Country Manager, Wright-Patterson
  AFB, OH.
  5.1.5. Shipments to/from OCONUS locations will use AMC or USTRANSCOM DCD
  routing options for classified secret or confidential, sensitive, classified/unclassified NWRM
  and controlled shipments. The U.S. Postal Service will not be used to move any NWRM
  shipments. Reference DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, chapter 205.
  5.1.6. Classified SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, CCI, AA&E, classified and unclassified
  NWRM shipments will be afforded the Transportation Protective Service (TPS) as depicted
  in         DTR           4500.9-R,        Part        II,         Chapter          205,
  http://www.transcom.mil/j5/pt/dtrpart2/dtr_part_ii_205.pdf. The U.S. Postal Service will
  not be used to move any NWRM shipments.
  5.1.7. The AF Form 4387, Outbound Transportation Protective Service Materiel Worksheet,
  provides a worksheet for processing outbound TPS shipments. TOs must use this worksheet
  to process TPS materiel for movement. The packaging certifier must validate Section I tasks
  prior to shipment planning. The movement documentation certifier must validate Section II
  tasks prior to shipment release. Certifications will be accomplished by a 7-level, 2T0/2T2
  technical sergeant or above, or civilian equivalent (based on the unit manning document).
  Waiver authority for a certified, 5-level staff sergeant or civilian equivalent will be at the
  LRS/APS commander level. The individual performing the tasks and the certifiers cannot be
  the same person. NOTE: AMC aerial ports are not required to generate the AF Form 4387 to
  document movement of cargo on AMC channel missions. This does not relieve origin TOs
  of their responsibility to accomplish the tasks required by policy for cargo routed via AMC
  channel missions.
     5.1.7.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) All unit/personnel that offer for shipment AA&E,
     classified, and sensitive items that are packaged by the shipping unit will complete the
     AF Form 4387, Outbound Transportation Protective Service Material Checklist,
     (Attachment 6) to include signing the ―Packed By‖ block and submit the form to the
     LGRDDC-O with other pertinent shipping documents. LGRDDC-O will then certify the
     AF Form 4387 for shipment.
58                                        AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


        5.1.7.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) LGRDDC-O will verify shipment document, DD
        Form 1348-1A, to ensure it contains the required information and is correctly
        accomplished IAW DoD and Federal directives. LGRDDC-O will initiate an AA&E and
        Classified Processing Checklist, AF Form 4387, Outbound Transportation Protective
        Service Material Checklist for items that are packaged by LGRDDC-O. Incorrect
        shipping documentation will not be accepted.
     5.1.8. TOs will use the AF Form 4388, Inbound Transportation Protective Service Materiel
     Checklist, when receiving TPS shipments. The checklist must be accomplished in
     conjunction with in-checking process. It is not the intent to accomplish the form after the
     fact.
        5.1.8.1. All classified and unclassified NWRM assets will be in-checked immediately
        upon receipt and inspected to ensure seals are intact and there is no evidence of damage
        or tampering with the container. TOs will ensure markings match information on the
        movement documents. Only personnel appointed and certified IAW paragraph 1.5.4.,
        shall process and in-check NWRM assets.
        5.1.8.2. If no discrepancies are detected, receiving personnel will legibly print name and
        sign (block letters: Last, FI, MI, Phone, and Organization) date and complete the AF
        Form 4388.
        5.1.8.3. The receiver must acknowledge within 2 hours (CONUS) and 8 hours
        (OCONUS) of in-checking a receipt of NWRM. Receiving personnel will use official e-
        mail/fax to notify the consignor and the NWRM Transaction Control Center (NTCC), or
        the Air Force Space Command Logistics Support Center (AFSPC LSC) that the shipment
        has been received. The e-mail must include the TCN, NSN, part number, document
        number, quantity, unit of issue and applicable serial number(s). NWRM receipts will be
        processed using the following procedures. The AFGLSC NTCC can be contacted at
        DSN 312-576-4633 (COMM 618-256-4633) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week or at
        635scow.ntcc@scott.af.mil.
            5.1.8.3.1. NTCC or the AFSPC LSC and LRS will perform the appropriate research
            to determine if valid requirements exist for those NWRM not shipped by normal
            MILSTRIP procedures. Utilize standard requisition procedures prior to receipt
            processing actions.
            5.1.8.3.2. NTCC or the AFSPC LSC will lift freeze code "N", and notify the
            requesting Receiving Section that the freeze code has been removed.
            5.1.8.3.3. Receiving will process the REC. After processing, contact NTCC or the
            AFSPC LSC to reload the freeze code "N".
        5.1.8.4. Shipping agency will acknowledge receipt of receipt notification, clear suspense
        file, and maintain all REPSHIP documents, DD Form 1348-1s and AF Form 4388s with
        the bill of lading or manifest pickup report for 10 years.
        5.1.8.5. If discrepancies are detected or the shipment is not received by the RDD, a TDR
        will immediately be initiated by the receiving activity.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                         59


       5.1.8.6. If the shipping agency does not receive confirmation of receipt by the RDD the
       shipping activity will initiate immediate tracer actions and notify the shipping
       NWRMAO or MASO.
   5.1.9. DELETED
       5.1.9.1. DELETED
5.2. Description of Classified Material on a BOL. The TO protects NWRM classified and
protected cargo shipments from compromise and conceals the exact nature of materiel classified
SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL and classified/unclassified NWRM. The BOL description used by
the TO should accurately identify the shipment without disclosing the exact nature of the
material. It should give the same freight rate for the assessment of freight charges as the actual
material shipped.
   5.2.1. Never show security classification on copies of BOLs or documents attached to
   shipments.
   5.2.2. The TO provides a description to use on BOLs sent to a contractor for completion.
5.3. Controlled Inventory Item Codes (CIIC)/Physical Security Codes (PSC). The CIIC or
PSC is found in Block 9 of the DD Form 1348-1A. The DTR, Part II, Chapter 205, Table 205-7,
provides the CIIC/Security Risk Code (SRC) and the degree of protection risk categories that are
associated with that code.      The table can be found at this link (page II-205-55):
http://www.transcom.mil/j5/pt/dtrpart2/dtr_part_ii_205.pdf.
   5.3.1. Risk category codes (e.g., Sensitivity Code, Security Code) use the item stock number
   and the FEDeral LOGistics (FED LOG) Data on Compact Disc. FED LOG is maintained by
   DLA, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084, DSN: 932-4725.
   5.3.2. Further guidance for moving SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL material by mail is in
   DOD5200.1R/AFI 31-401. DOD 4525.8-M/AF Supplement 1 restricts shipments to a
   packaged weight of 70 pounds or less and 108 inches in length and girth combined. USPS
   can also be used for shipments of small quantities (15 or less) of CAT II through IV small
   arms and Air Force M-16 weapons for CONUS movements. Registered Mail/Return Receipt
   Requested is required. Note: AMC Airlift or USTRANSCOM DCD is the only method to
   ship all NWRM, classified Secret or Confidential, sensitive, and controlled material to and
   from OCONUS. Do not use the USPS method to move AA&E, classified, protected,
   sensitive and controlled cryptographic cargo, or classified/unclassified NWRM shipments to
   an AMC APOE for onward channel airlift.
5.4. Classified and Protected Cargo Movement Codes (Transportation Level of
Protection). TPS codes and minimum protection service for sensitive and classified shipments
are listed in DTR 4500.9-R, Part II. Signature and Tally Record Service (ST) is designed to
provide continuous tracking of shipments from origin to destination. It is considered a tracing
service, not a protective service when used independently. The DD Form 1907 or equivalent
carrier-furnished signature and tally record is acceptable. For additional information refer to
DTR, Parts II and III. For Minimum TPS for all NWRM, Sensitive AA&E and Classified
Shipments see DTR Part II, Chapter 205 for further guidance.
Note: Always reference modal tables in DTR Chapter 205 when moving AA&E.
5.5. Movement and Handling Requirements. TOs comply with the following requirements:
60                                         AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


     5.5.1. Obtain in writing individuals authorized to sign for all NWRM and protected material
     within their organizations (See Chapter 1 for further guidance).
     5.5.2. Ship weapons and same caliber ammunition in separate containers. During
     contingency, deployment, or military operation other than war (MOOTW), weapons and
     same caliber ammunition can be moved on the same pallet as long as they are packaged in
     separate containers.
     5.5.3. Certify to the highest degree of TPS when more than one classification or security risk
     category shipments are consolidated on a mobility pallet.
     5.5.4. Ship missile rounds separately from launch and control equipment.
     5.5.5. Provide the same protection for firearms and ammunition scheduled for
     demilitarization and retrograde, as other shipments of AA&E.
     5.5.6. Process export shipments through military managed and operated air or ocean
     terminals.
     5.5.7. Store sensitive and controlled (NWRM, classified, pilferable, and AA&E) items in an
     approved security cage when transportation or movement delays are experienced. All
     NWRM storage facilities, cages, containers, rooms, etc, will have a key and lock program
     IAW AFI 31-101 and AFI 31-401 and approved GSA security vaults for
     classified/NWRM/AA&E shipments.
        5.5.7.1. Do not leave classified materiel unattended except when secured in the classified
        storage area. All discrepancies (gains or losses) will constitute a potential compromise of
        classified information. Immediately secure the material, report all discrepancies to the
        security manager and begin research efforts (e.g. tracer action and shipping discrepancy
        report, report of survey investigation, etc.). Classified items will not remain on the
        receiving line for any reason.
     5.5.8. Select commercial carriers that provide single line-haul service from point of origin to
     destination when routing sensitive shipments. Trailer interchange service is acceptable
     providing the interchange carrier also provides the required service. AMC Airlift or
     USTRANSCOM DCD are the only method to ship all NWRM, classified Secret or
     Confidential, sensitive, and controlled material to and from OCONUS.
     5.5.9. If deploying and traveling commercially refer to DTR Part III, DOD Foreign
     Clearance Guide, and COCOM reporting instructions for weapons and ammunition
     movement guidance.
     5.5.10. Before releasing a shipment requiring TPS, ensure the driver possesses a valid
     operator‘s. license, medical examiner‘s certificate, employee record card or similar document
     with the driver‘s photograph. The TO must be able to verify a driver‘s affiliation with the
     TSP named on the BL. DD FORM 626, Motor Vehicle Inspection (Transporting Hazardous
     Materiel), is required for all shipments moving under SNS (see DTR, Part II).
        5.5.10.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Before releasing a Transportation Protective
        Service (TPS) protected shipment to the carrier, LGRDDC-O Transportation Agents will
        verify and annotate proper security clearances of the carrier representative. Documented
        proof of clearance will be maintained in the shipment record.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                         61


      5.5.10.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) When loading is completed, attach seals to cargo
      door and have the driver sign the Commercial Bill of Lading (CBL), DD Form 626,
      Motor Vehicle Inspection (Transporting Hazardous Material) and DD Form 1907,
      Signature and Tally Record.
      5.5.10.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) If required, ensure four (4) placards are attached
      to the transport vehicle; one on the front and back, one on each side.
      5.5.10.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Shipment will not be released from Cargo
      Movement Operations System until the commercial carrier has left the installation.
5.6. Packaging Classified/NWRM Material:
   5.6.1. If the classified material is an internal component of a packageable item of equipment,
   the outside shell or body may be considered as the inner enclosure provided it does not reveal
   classified information.
   5.6.2. If the classified material is an inaccessible internal component of a bulky item of
   equipment, the outside or body of the item may be considered to be a sufficient enclosure
   provided observation of it does not reveal classified information.
   5.6.3. If the classified material is an item or equipment that is not reasonably packageable
   and the shell or body is classified, it shall be concealed with an opaque covering that will
   hide all classified features.
   5.6.4. Shipping and storage containers, including closed cargo transporters such as
   dromedaries, may be considered the outer wrapping or cover when used and are compliant
   with the double containment requirement of safeguarding classified materiel.
   5.6.5. Controlled and protected cargo (controlled, sensitive, classified, pilferable, and any
   NWRM) materiel shall be prepared for shipment, packaged and sealed in ways that minimize
   risk of accidental exposure or undetected deliberate compromise. Put shipping documents in
   inner-most shipping container and obliterate all markings not applicable to the shipment on
   outside of shipping container (Container NSN, United Nations Performance Oriented
   Packaging (POP) markings and orientation/special handling markings and/or labels
   applicable to the shipment will remain on NWRM shipments). The container shall not bear
   any classification markings or other unusual marks that might invite special attention to the
   fact that the contents are classified or protected cargo. Note: shippers must apply all
   HAZMAT related markings and labels to controlled, protected cargo and NWRM
   HAZMAT shipments. Additional guidance can be found in DTR chapter 205 and DOD
   5200.1-R. Mark and label IAW MIL-STD-129, which can be found at
   http://www.dscc.dla.mil/offices/packaging/specstdslist.html#STDs. Personnel packaging
   and verifying controlled and protected cargo certify that items are properly classified,
   described, packaged, marked and labeled, and in proper condition for movement according to
   applicable regulations. Use AF Form 4387 for certification. Packers and certifiers include
   Technical Specialists, shipment originators and items packaged prior to delivery to the TO
   for movement. Units and/or technical experts packaging AA&E, classified, any NWRM and
   sensitive items shipments for movement, will initiate and complete Part I.
   Packaging/Preparation of AF Form 4387, Outbound Transportation Protective Service
   Materiel Worksheet. Units will ensure technical experts sign Part I ―Packed By‖ and at least a
   7-level technical expert will sign ―Certified By‖ of the AF form, validating the item is packed
62                                         AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


     correctly in accordance with applicable regulations and technical orders and the
     accompanying documentation accurately reflects the contents.
        5.6.5.1. Do not mark exterior containers to indicate the security classification or TPS
        required. However, when a shipment goes by military airlift, DD Form 1387-2, Special
        Handling Data/Certification, must show the TPS required in Block 6. See DTR, PART II,
        Chapter 205, for 1387-2 preparation and distribution. Do not include item description
        (nomenclature) or any information that indicate the nature of the contents on the exterior
        of protected cargo. When shipping material that is both classified and hazardous, the
        shipper prepares and distributes a Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous Goods, (DTR,
        Chapter 204). Logistics Readiness Squadron functions will ensure the removal,
        replacement, and necessary destruction or obliteration of authorized tags and labels (i.e.
        999, NMCS, 777, etc) is accomplished while in-checking or shipping property unless
        required by directives to be retained (i.e. aircraft engines, ammunition, and hazardous
        material). All markings on shipping containers not applicable to the shipment will be
        obliterated unless otherwise required by directives.
        5.6.5.2. For controlled, sensitive, classified, any NWRM and pilferable items (except for
        FMS shipments), all shipping documentation shall be placed inside all containers rather
        than on the outside. Do not include copies of the MSDS either in or on the shipment.
        5.6.5.3. NWRM shipments will not be consolidated.
5.7. Special Instructions for Small Arms and Other Weapons. Small arms and other
weapons and firearms consist of:
     5.7.1. Handguns
     5.7.2. Shoulder-fired weapons
     5.7.3. Light automatic weapons (up to and including .50 caliber machine guns)

     vulnerable to theft.
     5.7.10. Procurements of New Small Arms and Other Weapons. Organizational users will
     contact 406 SCMS/GUMA (AFGLSC), Robins AFB GA, DSN 468-2771, to identify
     necessary packaging issues.
     5.7.11. Repackaging Small Arms After Inspection, Exercise and Storage. Qualified
     packaging personnel will do the packaging. They must repackage weapons opened for
     exercises, or other reasons, within ten days of the exercises. Contact 406 SCMS/GUMA,
     Robins AFB GA, DSN 468-2771 for requests on packaging waiver authority to deviate
     (follow paragraph 9.6.12. for additional guidance). Do not store packaging materials in the
     weapons storage area.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                          63


   5.7.12. Identification Markings for Small Arms. Mark each individual unit package, the
   intermediate and exterior containers IAW MIL-STD-129, paragraph 4.4.3.14. Do not attach
   packaging lists or other documents identifying the contents to the exterior container. Print
   the serial numbers for firearms shipments onto the DD Form 1348-1A or on a separate list or
   memorandum. The list or memorandum must show the requisition number and item stock
   number. If inappropriate markings are already applied, obliterate them.
   5.7.13. Do not apply these controls to items reduced to scrap or to parts and pieces that do
   not constitute complete firearms.
   5.7.14. Receiving Firearms. Check each container for item identification, condition,
   quantity, and verification of serial numbers. (For shipments from Warner Robins ALC, notify
   Warner Robins ALC/DSMA). The local security office will be notified of firearms
   discrepancies. These actions do not preclude the submission of SF 364 or DD Form 361, as
   appropriate.
   5.7.14. (HOLLOMANAFB) Special Instructions for Small Arms and Other Weapons.
   Any unit/personnel that offer small arms and/or other weapons for shipment must ensure the
   weapons are secured in approved weapons cases (original container, or bring AF Form 451,
   Request for Packaging Service, prior to bringing the weapons to the LGRDDC-Outbound
   Element.
5.8. Explosives. AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, provides guidance on hazard
classification, firefighting, handling, transportation, storage, and compatibility of explosives.
Use only approved locations to store ammunition and explosives while in the DTS.
5.9. Escort Criteria of AA&E for Carrier Load/Off-Load and Base Surface
Movements. On-base escort of AA&E and classified material will be established and approved
by the Installation Security Council. Origin and destination TOs and transship/in transit locations
must be knowledgeable of their local Installation Security Plan for movement to/from the
processing or storage areas; to/from the carrier‘s equipment; and to/from the surface and aircraft
load/off load locations. Escort selection should encompass consideration of who is best qualified
to take action in case of emergencies and the training expertise needed when considering various
levels of protective services. When using military ground transportation for movement off base
to field locations, deployments, etc., refer to AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security
Program, or contact the Security Forces office for procedures.
   5.9.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) The primary entry to the base for delivery trucks is the
   West Gate. In the event that the West Gate is closed during normal duty hours, the alternate
   entry for the base is the Main Gate. All commercial vehicles will be escorted to/from the
   area in which they are loaded/unloaded.
   5.9.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) With the exception of explosives and placarded
   amounts of hazardous materials laden vehicles, the ultimate consignee or recipient is
   responsible for escorting commercial carriers to/from the commercial gate.
   5.9.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Vehicle Inspection: The West Gate is designated as the
   Base‘s Vehicle Inspection Station. The alternate vehicle inspection area is the Main Gate, in
   the event the West Gate is closed.
 64                                         AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


      5.9.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) The 49th Security Forces Squadron will stop all
      commercial carriers delivering explosives or placarded amounts of hazardous materials at the
      base entrance, and notify LGRDDC-R to perform a vehicle safety inspection using a DD
      Form 626, Motor Vehicle Inspection (Transporting Hazardous Material). Note: Class 1.1
      1.2, and 1.3 explosives will never be brought to Building (Bldg) 311 or Bldg 310.
      5.9.5. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) At the designated inspection station, LGRDDC-R will
      check the carrier‘s vehicle for obvious exterior damage and examine the seals for tampering.
      If there is no apparent damage or tampering, then proceed with the vehicle inspection.
      5.9.6. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) For explosive shipments; after the vehicle inspection,
      as appropriate, a Security Forces, LRS, Munitions Storage Area (MSA) representative, or
      annotated recipient will escort the carrier via the Primary/Alternate Munitions Delivery
      Routes to the explosives off-load area. The route map can be found on SharePoint link
      identified on paragraph 3.1.2.6 In the event an accident or incident occurs during the course
      of operation, contact the appropriate offices below:

      5.9.7. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) LGRDDC- R will maintain escort responsibility of
      explosive shipments until accepted into MSA or downloading commences by recipient.
      5.9.8. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Organizations that require escort into their receiving
      areas (e.g. MSA, 46th Test Group, etc.) will make every attempt to expedite carrier reception
      handling, loading/unloading to prevent excessive wait time and charges. Note: Most
      carriers afford only 2 hours to load/unload as part of the standard charges. Any time over the
      afforded 2 hours is ―excessive wait time‖.
      5.9.9. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) LGRDDC-R will complete the receiving AF Form
      4388, Receiving Transportation Protective Service Material Checklist, upon completion of
      unloading process. A copy of the checklist will remain with the inbound shipment file.
      5.9.10. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) The LGRDD-O will work with the Materiel
      Management Flight to ensure the Classified Receipt Listing identifies only those wing
      personnel that are authorized to receive, handle, and transport classified assets.
      5.9.11. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) When the Vehicle Operations Control Center receives
      a request to move classified material/assets they will refer to the LGRD Classified Receipt
      Listing to ensure the operators which will be dispatched to move the items are certified to
      move classified materials/assets prior to any movement taking place.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                          65


   5.9.12. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) The dispatcher will follow local dispatching
   procedures but will also brief the operators regarding classified movement IAW this wing
   instruction and the AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS.
   5.9.13. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) The dispatcher will ensure the operators have an
   updated Classified Receipt Listing prior to dispatching the operator for a classified
   movement.
   5.9.14. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) LGRDD-O personnel will check all shipment
   documentation to verify the classification of the asset/material prior to handling or
   transporting the item.
   5.9.15. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) After picking up the item, the operators assume
   responsibility for the security of the classified asset and must maintain 100% positive control.
   The operators will proceed directly to the drop off point for the package and at no time leave
   the item unattended or out of sight.
   5.9.16. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Operators will ensure the classified item is delivered
   to the correct organization identified by the LGRDDC-R. Upon delivery, the operators will
   use the Classified Receipt Listing to verify the person receiving the package is authorized to
   sign/receive classified materials.
5.10. Advance Shipment Planning. The TO will conduct positive advance shipment planning
that includes liaison with the POCs representing the consignor (shipper's material prep-for-
transport office), the consignee (material receipt personnel and TO), and the TSP‘s dispatcher to
ensure the safe, secure, and cost effective transport of AA&E, and classified SECRET,
CONFIDENTIAL, CCI and NWRM materials. (See DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, Chapter 205)
   5.10.1. For any NWRM shipments, the TO shall notify the Consignee in advance of the
   shipment and the Consignee shall acknowledge the ability to receive shipment. The TO shall
   await positive acknowledgement from the recipient before the shipment occurs.
5.11. Report of Shipment (REPSHIP) Process.
   5.11.1. The origin shipping office must send a REPSHIP (manual or automated) to the
   ultimate destination (and to the POE for OCONUS DTS shipments) for all categories of
   materiel requiring TPS IAW the DTR, Part II, Chapter 205. This includes shipments made
   using TPS carriers as well as when registered mail is the method of transportation for
   classified material. Automated REPSHIP process will be used where possible. For origins
   and destinations without an automated REPSHIP capability, FAX or email processes will be
   exercised. Note: Instructions for implementing the automated REPSHIP are available on
   CMOS Training folder at https://www.gunter.af.mil/il/ilr/ilrc/documents.aspx.
   5.11.1.1. (HOLLOMANAFB) (Added) REPSHIP processes: LGRDDC-R will, upon
   receipt of an inbound Report of Shipment (REPSHIP) for all classified, AA&E, and sensitive
   shipment, furnish the quantity, and estimated time and/or date of arrival to the receiving unit.
   This will allow receiving unit to prepare workload and facilities for the pending delivery.
       5.11.1.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) LGRDDC-O will contact the receiving
       destination for verification of receipt of cargo within 24 hours of the required delivery
       date. If receiving destination is unable to confirm receipt of cargo on Required Delivery
       Date (RDD), the LGRDDC will contact consignee again after two (2) duty days. If
66                                         AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


        receiving destination does not confirm receipt of cargo by RDD + 2 duty days a SF 361,
        Transportation Discrepancy Report (TDR) will be initiated. If the receiving destination
        does not respond, then verification may be made through the carrier‘s electronic signature
        service via the Defense Transportation Tracking System or the carrier‘s automated
        tracking system.
     5.11.2. All Air Force shipping/receiving activities will establish and maintain REPSHIP
     suspense lists to ensure timely receipt of material. Receiving activities will issue a TDR
     when REPSHIPs are not received prior to receipt of shipment. Origin shipping activity will
     issue a TDR when an Air Force receiving activity does not acknowledge receipt of the
     REPSHIP within 24 hours.
     5.11.2.1. For any transportation discrepancy noted on shipments of AA&E, classified
     materiel, sensitive/protected materiel, and either classified or unclassified NWRM it shall be
     reported immediately to AF/A4LM,AFGLSC 401 SCMS/GUMAA and respective
     MAJCOM. Copies of the TDR and supporting documentation shall be forwarded to all
     offices. The 401 SCMS/GUMAA will track the status of the TDR until corrective action is
     taken or if damage/loss has occurred through final restitution of any monetary claim paid to
     DFAS. Additionally, damage or loss of any Air Force assets in transit where the claim is
     equal to or exceeds $20,000 will be subject to the same provisions of this paragraph. 401
     SCMS/GUMAA will gather historical metrics to identify trends and recommend corrective
     actions through AF/A4LM. Also see chapter 10 for further TDR guidance.
     5.11.3. For all Satellite Monitoring Service (SNS) shipments between CONUS origins and
     destinations, shippers must use the DTTS website to transmit a REPSHIP to the final
     destination. To do this, shipping activities must first obtain an IRRIS account and system
     access. (Visit the IRRIS website https://www.irris.tea.army.mil/ to get an account).
     Shipping activities may also register for the REPSHIP Alert function, as this capability is not
     automatic when gaining an IRRIS account.
        5.11.3.1. When SNS shipment REPSHIPs are made through DTTS, the shipper must
        verify the shipment information is resident in DTTS and a REPSHIP was transmitted.
        Access the IRRIS website‘s BOL screen within 20 minutes after releasing the shipment
        (from your shipper system) to confirm. You must release the shipment prior to carrier
        transmitting their departure message to DTTS. If the shipment data is not resident, go to
        the ―Add Shipment‖ feature and enter the shipment information. This will manually
        generate the automated REPSHIP from DTTS.
        5.11.3.2. Activities receiving SNS shipments must confirm receipt of the shipment
        (using IRRIS website) within 2 hours of delivery. Shipping and receiving offices must
        contact DTTS office at 1-800-826-0794 (24-hour operation) and forward required
        information if the DTTS website is inaccessible for any reason.
     5.11.4. Shippers executing a REPSHIP for other than SNS shipments must utilize an
     automated means (e.g., e-mail or FAX) to transmit the REPSHIP to final destination for all
     modes of transportation. A REPSHIP is not required if an automated advanced shipment
     notice capability exists. For automated advanced shipment notices, if there is no automated
     receipt acknowledgement within 2 business hours, origin will fax a paper REPSHIP or email
     to the destination and follow up with a confirming call to validate receipt. CONUS
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                          67


   REPSHIP notifications/advanced shipment notices will be made within 2 hours of shipment
   departure. OCONUS notifications will be made within 8 hours of shipment departure.
   5.11.5. Air Force destination receiving TO/approved contractor must acknowledge receipt of
   shipment within 24 hours of receipt (for SNS shipments, see 5.11.3.2). The destination must
   immediately inform their security officer and the origin shipping office if the shipment is not
   received by the REPSHIP ETA date and the responsible carrier cannot provide shipment
   accountability, acceptable explanation for delay and new ETA. Specific shipment status will
   be provided and, if applicable, include proof that the shipment is under carrier's control in
   their system, an acceptable reason for the carrier's delay and their new ETA. The origin
   shipping office will immediately inform their security officer and initiate tracer action when
   notified shipment is overdue at destination.
   5.11.6. NWRM (classified and unclassified) REPSHIP Procedures.
       5.11.6.1. All NWRM shipments and receipts will have 100 percent REPSHIP
       notification and confirmation regardless of the shipments classification and protective
       service provided.
       5.11.6.2. In addition to REPSHIPs, all NWRM shipments require official e-mail
       (NIPRNET) sent by the origin shipper to the destination receiving unit to ensure all
       parties are fully aware of the shipment. For NWRM shipments originating in CONUS to
       OCONUS, include submission of the REPSHIP to the responsible APOE Customer
       Service Branch (CSB) office. For NWRM shipments originating in OCONUS, include
       submission of the REPSHIP to the servicing Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC).
       The notification will be made within 2 hours (CONUS) and 8 hours (OCONUS) of
       releasing an outbound shipment. Send the e-mail to: NWRM Transaction Control Center
       (NTCC) at 635scow.ntcc@scott.af.mil and organizational email accounts of the origin
       and destination Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel Accountable Officer
       (NWRMAO)/Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO) or contractor receiving
       activity, as appropriate. The e-mail should contain movement document/AWB number
       and shipment TCN(s).
   5.11.7. REPSHIP communications should remain unclassified unless they contain classified
   information.
   5.11.8. Disposition for shipping and supporting documentation (including REPSHIPS) for
   all TPS, NWRM and FMS shipments will be 10 years IAW AFRIMS, Table & Rule T24-01
   R03.00.
5.12. Pilferable Cargo Protection. Origin and destination TOs identify those shipments
deemed to be pilferable and hold these shipments in a secure area such as a security cage while
in transportation's possession. Report any suspected pilferage to the base security force
authorities and consignor. Assist investigative personnel to include tracing the shipment from
origin to point of pilferage detection.
5.13. Movement of Classified, Protected and all NWRM Shipments via Blanket Purchase
Agreement (BPA) DOD Domestic Express Small Package Service (DESPS) Carriers. Some
shipments may be moved within CONUS and to/from Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico via an
authorized carrier if eligible. For specific guidance see DTR, Part II, Chapter 205. Prior to using
a DESPS carrier for classified, protected and any NWRM shipments TOs must confirm the
 68                                         AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


initial or continued use of a carrier for movement of DOD classified material. Authorized
carriers can be found at website: https://private.amc.af.mil/A4/domexpress/spsindex.html.
Compliance with the restrictions and processes in the following paragraphs is mandatory to
preclude any security violations caused by improper handling of classified shipments.
      5.13.1. Origin TOs:
         5.13.1.1. WILL NOT USE THIS MODE/METHOD TO MOVE CLASSIFIED
         SHIPMENTS OR ANY (classified/unclassified) NWRM SHIPMENTS TO THE AMC
         APOE FOR CHANNEL AIRLIFT.
         5.13.1.2. Must comply with the provisions of DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401,
         Information Security Program Management.
         5.13.1.3. Must process all classified freight shipments for the base unless the TO
         establishes other arrangements.
         5.13.1.4. Must use only NEXT DAY carrier service under these procedures, providing
         the provisions meet this policy.
         5.13.1.5. Must give the shipment to the DESPS carrier only when there is assurance of
         next day delivery service and consignee receipt. Do not document on outside container
         or advise the carrier, by any means, that the shipment is classified.
             5.13.1.5.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) The DESPS carrier(s) will be used only
             when next-day delivery can be provided. This mode WILL NOT be used on Friday
             unless ―Saturday Delivery‖ has been coordinated with consignee.
         5.13.1.6. Must ensure the package wrapping, marking, and addressing are in compliance
         with directives, if packed by TO personnel, otherwise the shipper is responsible for the
         integrity of the shipment. The carrier‘s package may be used as the outer wrapper.
         Classification markings, packing list, and classified document receipt will be located on
         the inner container.
         5.13.1.7. Will not ship classified to, from or between DOD contractors, unless it has
         been verified that the contractor has the required Defense Security Service approval in
         accordance with DOD 5200.1-R. See DTR Part II, Chapter 205.
         5.13.1.8. The air waybill, either electronic or hard copy, must require the carrier to
         provide a delivery signature. Track shipment status using the carrier web-based system to
         include selection of e-mail notification of any shipment exceptions (i.e. weather delay,
         missed truck at sort facility, missed delivery date, etc.) experienced by the carrier in route
         and initiate the automated proof of delivery capability.
         5.13.1.9. Must send a REPSHIP. See Paragraph 5.11.
         5.13.1.10. Must confirm delivery of classified shipments processed through their office
         within two working days after carrier pickup. Confirmation must be made through both
         the REPSHIP process (i.e. direct contact with addressee) and the carrier‘s electronic
         signature service, or the carrier‘s automated system or tracking software program and file
         signature verification document. Print out and retain confirmation receipt information
         from the carrier‘s system for record.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                           69


   5.13.2. Destination TOs:
       5.13.2.1. Must handle all DESPS/BPA carrier deliveries to final customer as classified
       shipments until it is verified that the shipment is unclassified.
       5.13.2.2. May turn over classified shipments to consignee without additional
       documentation, aside from that normally used as long as the individual accepting the
       shipment is authorized to receipt for classified shipments in accordance with the
       provisions of subparagraph 5.13.3.2.
   5.13.3. Origin and Destination TOs:
       5.13.3.1. Must develop locally written procedures with information management and
       other base customers, and security personnel covering the preparation, handling, receipt,
       documentation, and delivery of classified shipments moving via the DESPS/BPA carrier.
       5.13.3.2. Must ensure only designated and cleared personnel are authorized to receipt
       and/or process DESPS/BPA carrier deliveries.
       5.13.3.3. Immediately report any problem encountered in the movement of classified,
       protected and NWRM materiel by the DESPS/BPA carrier(s) to their MAJCOM, and the
       Agency Contracting Officer's Representative (ACOR) at HQ USAF/A4LM.
5.14. Secure Holding Areas (Formerly Safe Haven, Refuge and Secure Holding Areas). Air
Force installations capable of providing holding area will do so to assure positive security control
over movement of DOD munitions and other sensitive cargo. Holding area safety and security
procedures are detailed in the DTR, Part II. For Nuclear secure holding area requirements, refer
to DOD C-5210.41-M, Air Force Supplement, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual.
   5.14.1. TOs are responsible for ensuring their Installation Commander, in coordination with
   the other installation supporting functions, are aware of the responsibilities set forth in this
   instruction. Installation Commanders should ensure transportation, security forces, disaster
   preparedness, civil engineer, medical, munitions, environmental and safety personnel work
   closely together to develop and implement their local policy in support of this DOD
   requirement. See DTR, Part II, Chapter 205 and AFI 31-101.
   5.14.2. TOs will update their installation holding area capabilities through the TFG webpage
   so inbound and enroute shippers/carriers can successfully plan munitions and sensitive cargo
   movements. For procedures on when and how to update the TFG, see instructions in DTR,
   Part II. User ID and password are required to access the TFG. TOs may view the list of
   secure holding sites from the TFG web page.
   5.14.3. The TO will contact the destination activity to confirm they have the ability and
   intent to receive and secure SRC I and II shipments. To prevent non-emergency in transit
   temporary parking needs, the origin TO must schedule shipments to arrive at the destination
   within normal receiving hours, making every effort to avoid the layover of shipments during
   weekends, holidays, and non-receiving hours.
5.15. Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS). Air Force shippers must monitor in
transit status of their inbound and outbound AA&E and classified shipments in DTTS. To
facilitate this action they will establish both TO and worker accounts to access the DTTS web-
site. Tracking assist in facilitating any afterhours receipt requirements through positioning data
available in DTTS. It is highly suggested TOs utilize the GEO Fencing and automated alert
 70                                        AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


capabilities in DTTS to mitigate after hours delivery requirements. New DTTS account requests
must be coordinated with AF/A4LM. DTTS will not establish new accounts without AF/A4LM
validation.
      5.15.1. Destination TO will utilize the DTTS web site to confirm receipt for all SNS
      shipments (For further guidance see 5.11.3). Shippers are able to electronically verify
      receipt, and DTTS automatically transmits a receipt verification message to the origin TO
      account.
      5.15.2. Origin shipping TO will verify the operational status of the DTTS monitoring system
      prior to loading TPS shipments. Confirm DTTS is enabled through visual examination of the
      DTTS message display. Record the status of the DTTS system check on page 1 of DD Form
      626, Item 14 A. DTTS monitoring system found to be defective must be corrected prior to
      loading. The CMOS movement document must be released immediately upon conveyance
      departure from the installation to ensure required data is residence in DTTS.
      5.15.3. DTTS Trailer Tracking Service (TTS). Only those carriers offering trailer tracking
      will be used for shipments requiring this TPS. This TPS will be identified in shipper systems
      by the letters DCS and accompanied by the clear text explanation (Trailer Tracking Service).
      TO personnel will verify TTS sensor components are affixed to the trailer and doors.
      Trailers spotted for loading that are missing TTS sensor components will be rejected. Carrier
      non-compliance with this service will be documented and reported IAW DTR Part II,
      Chapter 207, Carrier Performance. For further guidance, shippers should reference DTR,
      Part II, Chapter 205.
5.16. Emergency Hot Lines. Use the following SDDC and DTTS emergency hot line numbers
to obtain any type of DOD safety or security advice and assistance.

                                              Chapter 6

                                        BILLS OF LADING

6.1. Commercial Bill of Lading (CBL). Commercial forms and procedures, commercial
carrier electronic and manual forms, and other commercial processes and documentation are
considered CBLs. The DTR, Part II, also contains procedures for use of CBLs.
      6.1.1. Conversion of a CBL to a GBL should occur only under rare circumstances. Comply
      with guidance in DTR, Part II.
      6.1.2. For CBL shipments that do not have control identification, the TO must assign a
      control number. This number is to contain 10 alphanumeric digits. The first four positions are
      the origin TO Bill of Lading Office Code (BLOC), the fifth is the last digit of the fiscal year
      and the sixth through tenth position is the serial number. Use "00001" for the first shipment
      of the fiscal year and run consecutively through the fiscal year.
      6.1.3. A CBL register for outbound shipments is required, either automated or manual.
6.2. SF Form 1103, GBL, and SF Form 1109, GBL Continuation Sheet. Discontinuance of
GBLs for domestic freight shipments was effective 31 March 2002. However, when GBLs must
be used for international shipments, the TO will ensure adequate and complete preparation and
processing in compliance with the DTR, Part II. The DTR contains detailed information and
direction on GBL use.
      6.2.1. A GBL register for outbound shipments is required, either automated or manual. AF
      Form 1335, GBL Register-Outbound, may be used.
      6.2.2. Distribution of GBLs. Also see DTR, Part II. When using ANG TAC F8E0, a copy of
      the GBL must be provided to the ANG Readiness Center, Transportation Division
      (ANGRC/LGTT), 3500 Fetchet Ave, Andrews AFB, MD 20762.
      6.2.3. Comply with the procedures for GBL corrections or cancellations contained in DTR,
      Part II.
      6.2.4. Due to customs issues, Korea is the only country that requires a GBL. To enable these
      shipments to move on a GBL yet use TPB for payment, the following applies: On the GBL
      the statement "For Customs Purposes Only" will be shown in the Remarks Block. For non-
      TPPS carriers, show 401 SCMS/GUMAB, Bldg 262, 4375 Chidlaw Rd, Wright-Patterson
      AFB OH 45433-5066 in the Bill Charges To block. For TPPS carriers, in the Bill To Charges
      block show US Bank, 601 Second Ave, South, Minneapolis MN 55402. One copy of the
      GBL will be placed in the Packing List on the outside of the number 1 piece and one copy
      will be given to the carrier. The following procedures should be used in processing a
      ―Customs Only‖ GBL through CMOS:
         6.2.4.1. Prepare Commercial Airway bill using CMOS or carrier system.
         6.2.4.2. Apply Third Party Billing TAC or local funds to the Commercial Airway bill.
         6.2.4.3. Prepare a GBL in CMOS. DO NOT release the GBL from CMOS. It is held in
         temporary memory long enough to print a hard copy. Note: Duplicate GBL numbers
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                         73


      should not be used for customs clearance into the Republic of Korea. There have been
      instances of delays because of duplicate GBL numbers.
      6.2.4.4. "For Customs Purposes Only" must be clearly stated in the GBL remarks
      section.
      6.2.4.5. After hard copies are printed, all references to the GBL should be erased/cleared
      from CMOS while the bill is still in temporary memory.
   6.2.5. Most DOD shipments to Canada are exempt from requiring an export license under 22
   CFR 126.5, Canadian Exemptions. However, items on the United States Munitions List must
   be shipped using a CBL and a completed Shippers Export Declaration. Refer to DTR, Part V.
   6.2.6. Comply with GBL control procedures checklist. See Paragraph 6.4.
6.3. Consignee Copies. A copy of the CBL/GBL must be mailed or faxed to the consignee
when electronic transmission cannot be accomplished.
6.4. SF 1103 GBL Control Procedures. All shippers will implement the following procedures
to ensure positive control over GBLs. See DTR, Part II, for additional guidance.
   6.4.1. TOs and their designated representative will be appointed in writing as the
   responsible installation GBL issuing officer and held accountable for GBL control,
   safekeeping and disposition. Other activities will designate in writing their points of contact
   (POC) to the TO.
      6.4.1.1. TOs will appoint , in writing, all GBL preparers, certifying proper training has
      been conducted.
      6.4.1.2. TOs are responsible for keeping the GBL appointment letter up to date at all
      times and will immediately remove individuals from the list when they are no longer
      authorized to prepare GBLs.
   6.4.2. TOs should either separate duties or provide additional oversight to GBL preparation
   and processing functions.
      6.4.2.1. Supervisors will periodically review a random number of GBLs prior to their
      issue to ensure completeness, accuracy, and monitor compliance with individual GBL
      block changes.
      6.4.2.2. TOs should ensure 100 percent review of GBLs created for classified materiel,
      hazardous cargo, and other sensitive items.
      6.4.2.3. GBLs will not be used for commercial, door-to-door, export shipments except
      where host nation customs requirements dictate.
   6.4.3. TOs will maintain records of both paper and electronic GBLs issued and the supply of
   GBLs on hand.
      6.4.3.1. Electronic records will be maintained electronically.
      6.4.3.2. A file will be kept of numbers given by SDDC.
   6.4.4. Open packages of ordered GBLs immediately upon receipt and inventory to verify
   that none are missing.
74                                         AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


     6.4.5. TOs will establish procedures for conduct of audits by personnel external to the office
     controlling SF 1103s. Audits must be conducted at least every 180 days to verify inventories
     and records.
     6.4.6. Blank, unnumbered, original GBLs or reassembled GBL sets that have been issued to
     traffic managers or their designated representatives may not be transferred.
     6.4.7. When GBLs have become unfit for use, have been issued and the planned shipment is
     subsequently canceled, or lost GBLs have been recovered, all parts of the GBL set, except for
     the original, will be destroyed. The original will be marked "canceled" or "void" and filed in
     the ―property shipped‖ bill of lading file. Immediately notify SDDC, who in turn will notify
     all paying activities.
     6.4.8. If the original is unavailable for filing, a substitute form will be annotated with a
     signed explanation on why the GBL is missing.
     6.4.9. Lost, stolen, or otherwise unaccounted for GBLs will be immediately reported to the
     SDDC Operations Center (SDG3-GD-BP).
     6.4.10. Shippers will maintain limited numbers of either unnumbered or pre-numbered paper
     GBLs. As the unit of issue for paper GBLs is 100 per package, no office should have more
     than 100 paper GBLs on hand. Units with automated GBL producing capabilities, which
     maintain unnumbered paper GBLs, should contact SDDC/MTOP-PAS for GBL numbers to
     be used with the unnumbered paper GBLs. These GBL numbers should only be used during
     times of system failure. Do not load these numbers into your automated system. These
     numbers will be maintained on a separate GBL register and kept under lock and key. Pre-
     numbered GBL forms will be ordered from USAPPC. See DTR, Part II, Chapter 206, for
     more details.
     6.4.11. The number of electronic GBL numbers ordered at any single time will be based on
     an estimated 6 months' workload.
     6.4.12. GBL controls must be reinforced through training, inspections and briefings.

                            AF TRANSPORTATION FUNDING

7.1. Transportation Funding Policy. This chapter provides transportation funding policy.
Current procedures are in the funding memorandums available on-line at the AFGLSC, 591
Supply Chain Management Group (SCMG) portal website: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af/USAF/ep/browse.do?categoryId=p6925EC1555AC0FB5E044080020E329A9&parentCat
egoryId=-2120100&channelPageId=s6925EC13407A0FB5E044080020E329A9 From the
menu on the left, select Library >> Transportation Funding. Every Air Force MAJCOM,
shipping activity and DLA/DCMA activity with first and second destination funding
requirements must ensure they are using the latest information. Additional shipping controls
may be implemented due to funding shortages. For additional Air Force transportation funding
assistance, contact 401 SCMS/GUMAB , DSN 787-7912, commercial (937) 257-7912, fax DSN
787-7860, commercial (937) 257-7860, e-mail address: 401.scms.gumab@wpafb.af.mil.
   7.1.1. Unauthorized use. Air Force TACs are not to be used on shipments made for other
   services or DOD agencies except when filling a Working Capital Fund (WCF) MILSTRIP
   inter-service IM directed requisition (DOC ID = A2_/A4_/A5_ and Fund Code = 64, 6B or
   6C on the DD Form 1348-1A). For ANG shipments (DODAAC F_6000-F_6599), see
   paragraph 7.2.8, below. For Government Purchase Card (GPC) or Form 9 purchases, do not
   use an AF SDT CMA TAC or AFWCF TAC, refer to paragraph 7.3.4, below. For FMS
   shipments (DODAAC/TCN begins with B, D or P), see paragraph 7.4, below.
7.1.2. Air Force Second Destination Transportation/Centrally Managed Allotment (SDT/CMA)
is funded by AFMC and centrally managed by 591 SCMG/GUF (see paragraph 7.3.2. for a
description of SDT/CMA usage). Each major command and/or program office needing
SDT/CMA TAC funding must submit requirements to 591 SCMG/GUF for inclusion in the
budget forecast. Failure to provide SDT/CMA requirements will result in shipments being
unfunded.
   7.1.3. Major commands and/or program offices who are issued an SDT/CMA TAC must
   oversee execution of the SDT usage for the program through use of the SDT/CMA TAC burn
   rate charts, available on the 591 SCMG portal website. The command or program office will
   immediately notify 591 SCMG/GUF of any shipment(s) that are suspect and should not have
   been moved on the cited TAC so that cost recovery efforts can be initiated. The 591
   SCMG/GUF must rely on the command or program office who know more about their
   movement requirements than 591 SCMG/GUF personnel in identifying suspect shipments.
   This oversight will ensure the SDT/CMA TACs are only used for their intended purposes.
7.2. Transportation Funding Procedures. Whether a MILSTRIP or non-MILSTRIP
shipment, including shipments by other military services and agencies, it is the shipment
originator‘s responsibility to identify the correct funding by assignment of the appropriate TAC
or Operations and Maintenance (O&M) appropriation. Deployment and Distribution Flight
personnel must make every attempt to obtain required funding information from their customers
or the customer‘s unit Resource Advisor. When the shipment originator cannot provide required
information, TO personnel will use all available resources such as Tracker-Lite, Funding
Memorandums, or contact 401 SCMS/GUMAB for assistance. The TO is authorized to refuse
 76                                        AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


any shipment without proper funding information but only after all attempts to resolve funding
issues are exhausted.
      7.2.1. The TAC is a 4-position alphanumeric code that identifies the account to pay for
      movements within the DTS via AMC, MSC, and SDDC intermodal lift and port handling
      costs. The TAC also pays for movement by CBL when TPB procedures apply (see
      paragraph 12.3.). The complete funding appropriation, to include Standard Document
      Number (SDN), is used on bills of lading when local funds apply. NOTE: TOs must
      forecast and budget for sufficient local O&M funds (462 EEIC) to support shipments for
      authorized base units when use of Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) or Second
      Destination Transportation/Centrally Managed Allotment (SDT/CMA) funds are not
      applicable.
      7.2.2. Funding Identification for MILSTRIP shipment. LRS Commanders will ensure
      procedures are in place to require LRS Materiel Management to validate TACs printed on
      DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document, or DD Form 1348-1A without TACs
      generated by the Standard Base Supply System prior to delivery at TO. LRS Materiel
      Management personnel have inherent expertise to identify shipments as IM directed
      Redistribution Order (RDO) or lateral support through interpreting the document identifier.
      TOs will use current funding guidance (funding memos, messages, etc.) to verify TAC
      assignment has been appropriately applied. This is especially critical during post/post
      operations. Use of erroneous TACs will result in 591 SCMG/GUF re-imbursement off-set
      actions against unit funds to replenish the SDT CMA.
      7.2.3. For non-MILSTRIP shipments, where the DD Form 1149 serves as the shipping
      document, the TO will use the customer‘s funding appropriation or local O&M for
      OCONUS/CONUS movements.
         7.2.3.1. Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE), often referred to as
         PMEL equipment, requiring calibration which is shipping from a CONUS base to another
         CONUS location is a local funding responsibility. SDT CMA TAC F8TM will pay for
         return of the TMDE asset from the repair facility to the base, any required over ocean
         movement to/from OCONUS, port handling charges, and intra-/inter-theater movements
         via DTS. OCONUS inland is the responsibility of the OCONUS MAJCOM/base.
         Assign TAC F8TM to non-WCF assets. Note: Use Tracker Lite to determine if asset is
         WCF or non-WCF. TMDE shipments require use of Project Code 571. PMEL labs
         must annotate DD Form 1149 with the project code and the statement ―Recently repaired
         or calibrated‖ in order to use TAC F8TM. Newly purchased TMDE which has been
         tested and accepted at Heath OH may be moved to the bases using TAC F8TM and
         project code 489.
         7.2.3.2. Refer to the Air Force Funding Memo for other exceptions to use of local
         funding on DD Form 1149 shipments.
      7.2.4. The TO will refer to DTR Part II, Appendix V5, Paragraph B.3. for Munitions/Missile
      shipments.
7.2.5. When using customer‘s funding appropriation, in addition to the line of accounting
(LOA), the customer must also provide the Standard Document Number (SDN) which equates to
the obligating document, i.e., AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation/Reimbursement
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                        77


Document (MORD). For over ocean movement, units with an individual unit TAC must provide
the TAC and corresponding funding appropriation on the DD Form 1149. Other TACs
appropriate for over ocean movements are found in the funding memo (Paragraph 7.1.). NOTE:
Use of DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request may be used only for other
military services or agencies to transfer funds into local O & M base funds to affect shipment.
   7.2.6. EAF/AEF. TOs will ensure shipment documentation, in support of Expeditionary
   Aerospace Forces (EAF)/Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEF) deployments,
   humanitarian support, exercises or other special projects contain, if applicable, the assigned
   JCS (9-series) or AF project code and Emergency and Special Programs (ESP) code. The
   assigned ESP code will be annotated on all movement documents that obligate funds for the
   specific program (ESP:*** (insert code). Specific ESP codes are on the SAF/FMB web site
   at the end of this paragraph. Click on the FMB tab. Access to the AF Portal is required. The
   base or MAJCOM will fund exercise deployment/redeployment that is not in direct support
   of a JCS           project   code.    ESP Codes URL:             https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
   af/USAF/ep/browse.do?programId=298625&channelPageId=-351562&parentCategoryId=-
   351617.
   7.2.7. Misdirected Shipments. Refer to Chapter 10, Paragraph 10.10. for procedures.
   7.2.8. Air National Guard Shipments. When assets are shipped to an ANG base (DODAAC
   F_6000-F_6599), the funding responsibility belongs to the ANG for non-WCF asset
   shipments (RDOs and returns of serviceable assets from depot repair) and lateral support
   from an active duty base. Contact the receiving ANG base for local O&M fund cite when
   moving CONUS, when moving to OCONUS ANG bases, use the ANG TAC F8E0. Lateral
   support shipments for non-WCF assets from an ANG base to an active duty base is the
   funding responsibility of the receiving base. Receiving base must provide a long line fund
   cite when moving within CONUS.
       7.2.8.1. SDT/CMA TACs will fund movement of ANG assets in support of a
       contingency, but shipment must cite the appropriate JCS 9-series project code.
       7.2.8.2. Munitions shipments directed by the ANG are not a part of the PACER AMMO
       Program and will be funded by ANG units using local O&M funds or ANG TAC as
       directed by NGB/A4RDT. If munitions movement supports ANG activation in support
       of a contingency, SDT/CMA will fund the movement, see Para 7.2.8.1.
7.3. Funding Categories.
   7.3.1. Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). DWCF is a revolving fund that combines
   previously existing commercial or business operations under a single treasury account but
   keeps prior organizational structure and command authority relationships. Revolving funds
   are financial systems that are dependent on the sale of goods and services for the cash
   necessary to finance the activities to certain DOD organizations. They do not have direct
   appropriations and operate at zero profit or loss. The AFWCF, Supply Management Activity
   Group (SMAG) is a subset of the DWCF and consists of the divisions shown in Table 7.1.
   below.

      7.3.2. Air Force Second Destination Transportation/Centrally Managed Allotment
      (SDT/CMA). SDT/CMA pays for certain movements of non-AFWCF materiel. This
      includes movements of munitions, aircraft engines, and investment items that are managed
      on an Air Force Allowance Standard. SDT/CMA funds the following:
         7.3.2.1. CONUS movement from a depot level or contractor repair facility to base.
         7.3.2.2. Over ocean by MSC or AMC.
         7.3.2.3. CONUS port handling by SDDC.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                       79


       7.3.2.4. OCONUS inter or intra-theater movement by AMC or MSC, only when more
       cost effective than ground transportation or no other alternative is available. Cost
       comparison or justification documentation must be retained by the shipper.
       7.3.2.5. CONUS inter-MAJCOM movements when IM directed.
       7.3.2.6. Commercial door-to-door (BPA/WWX) where available. Cost comparison must
       prove commercial transportation is cheaper than AMC unless cargo is MICAP/999.
   7.3.3. MAJCOM or Base Funds. These funds pay for:
       7.3.3.1. CONUS movement of non-AFWCF items moving to a repair or storage facility.
       7.3.3.2. CONUS movement of any non-AFWCF intra-MAJCOM lateral support
       shipment regardless of IM direction, including movement to an APOE/WPOE/CCP.
       7.3.3.3. CONUS movement of shipments coded as ISU, DOR, or MSI in the document
       identifier field of the DD Form 1348-1A.
       7.3.3.4. CONUS movement of any non-AFWCF shipments coded as SHP, FTR, or 1ET
       in the document identifier field of the DD Form 1348-1A, including movement to an
       APOE/WPOE/CCP.
       7.3.3.5. Overseas MAJCOM pays theater port handling of all non-AFWCF materiel.
   7.3.4. Process Exceptions for Personal Property (Household Goods, Unaccompanied
   Baggage, Privately Owned Vehicles (POV), Materiel Movement, Local Purchase and
   Purchase Card Micropurchase Shipments within the DTS. The majority of Air Force
   sponsored personal property and materiel movements within the DTS are charged to the
   funding appropriation and/or TAC cited on the TDY/PCS order or to the TAC on the base
   supply document. Certain authorized DTS movements must be paid from the unit/base
   O&M funds requiring the establishment of a TAC. These shipments include return of excess
   household goods to non-temporary storage in the CONUS in conjunction with assignment to
   government quarters, micropurchases made through the GPC program, and materiel
   movement when normal TACs do not apply. For these shipments, the following applies:
       7.3.4.1. When shipments of personal property, materiel, local purchase, and purchase
       card shipments are entitled to move in the DTS, but are funded by unit/base O&M funds,
       a TAC chargeable to the O&M funds must be established prior to using AMC, MSC, or
       SDDC services. O&M funds used to pay for purchase card shipments expire on 30 Sep
       of each FY. Unless current FY funding is provided, TACs will be deleted from the
       system on 1 Oct. Purchase card users should be made aware that if a shipment changes
       mode from 30 Sep to 1 Oct, the previous year‘s FY funds would cease on 30 Sep.
Example: if a shipment arrives at a POE on 30 Sep but does not depart the POE until 1 Oct, the
new FY money will have to be in-place or the shipment will be frustrated at the port until the
new FY money is provided.
       7.3.4.2. Procedures for providing a LOA and MORD to obtain a TAC and completing
       shipping documents are located under Transportation Funding on the 591 SCMG portal
       website. When moving these shipments, normal DTR, Part II, clearance procedures
       apply. TP-4 deferred airfreight is also an option.

7.4. FMS shipments. At no time will any shipper assign an AF SDT CMA TAC to any FMS
shipment. FMS shipment costs should be covered by either Working Capital Fund (WCF) TACs
or the FMS case involved.
      7.4.1. TAC construction for non-WCF Air Force sponsored Foreign Military Sales (FMS)
      cargo shipments are contained in DTR, Part II.
      7.4.2. For FMS shipments of WCF materiel, only the CONUS inland portion of
      transportation (to the aerial/water port or FMS freight forwarder) is the funding responsibility
      of the shipping depot using WCF. Use the appropriate WCF TACs as shown on the WCF
      TAC table. The balance of transportation charges is funded through the FMS Letter of Offer
      and Acceptance (LOA) or paid by the FMS customer's freight forwarder.
      7.4.3. FMS Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR), formerly Report of Discrepancy (ROD),
      cargo shipments. The TAC for AF sponsored FMS SDR cargo shipments is DIII. For TAC
      DIII use the following long line of accounting classification:
97-11X8242.L009 8401 **DIII GBL S843000
** = Insert 2 character FMS country code.
      7.4.4. The TCN for returning SDR material will be constructed from the requisition
      document number governing the discrepant item(s). The TCN and TAC must be shown in the
      ―Description of Articles‖ block of the GBL or CBL.

                              PACKAGING AND HANDLING

8.1. Uniform       Procedures. Joint   Service Publication      AR   700-15/NAVSUPINST
4030.28D/AFMAN 24-206_IP_IP/MCO 4030.33D/DLAI 4145.7, Packaging of Materiel,
establishes uniform procedures for packaging Department of Defense (DOD) materiel. Use Air
Force packaging procedures in accordance with joint directive AFMAN 24-206_IP, AFPD 24-2
and this instruction.
8.2. Packaging Operations. The size and mission of an activity determines the required size of
base packaging facilities and the type, kind, and amount of equipment needed to package
materiel. Locate the packaging areas near the shipping or supply processing area.
8.3. Facilities. Each activity must have the basic facilities and equipment to package items that
are:
   8.3.1. Opened for periodic inspections.
   8.3.2. Received inadequately packaged for storage.
   8.3.3. Shipped off-base, including redistribution or return of declared excesses and return of
   reparable items to a prime ALC depot or Technology Repair Center (TRC).
8.4. Authorization of Equipment. Allowance Standard 874, part C, authorizes the cleaning,
drying, preserving, packing, and marking equipment for base-level packaging operations.
Authorization and funding for conveyer or other mechanized materiel handling equipment are
subject to AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Vol. VII, Part 1, which explains how to
request assistance in analyzing and recommending improvements in materiel handling methods
and systems installations.
8.5. Packaging Line Layout. Materiel flows from work station to work station according to the
sequence of packaging operations, regardless of the size of the operation and should include:
   8.5.1. An area for receiving, inspecting, and identifying material.
   8.5.2. An administrative and work-process planning area for reference materials, such as
   T.O.s, Special Packaging Instructions (SPIs), specifications, standards, and related logistics
   publications.
   8.5.3. A materials storage and supply area for maintaining bench stock preservative and
   packaging supplies and recycled containers (other than unit-stored reusable containers).
   8.5.4. An industrial equipment area for fabricating bags, boxes, crates, intermodal container
   blocking and bracing, printing labels and tags, and for feeding supplies (like tapes and
   adhesives) into the packaging line.
   8.5.5. A cleaning, drying, and preserving area.
   8.5.6. A unit packing area large enough to handle variable workloads.
   8.5.7. An area for containerizing and packing oversized materiel that cannot be handled in
   the unit packing area. This area must contain or be located near the woodworking machinery
   and be accessible to mechanized material handling equipment. Due to hazardous nature of
 82                                         AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


      munitions, the TO must ensure personnel are trained and equipped to conduct containerized
      blocking and bracing operations at alternative locations.
      8.5.8. At least one Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protective work station where trained
      personnel can package Electrostatic Discharge Sensitive (ESDS) items. This must include a
      conductive work surface and personnel grounding devices. T.O. 00-25-234, General Shop
      Practice Requirements for Repair, Maintenance, and Test of Electronic Equipment, contains
      detailed information about ESD protective work stations. Post signs prohibiting entry of
      unauthorized personnel and static-producing materials in areas designated for packaging
      ESDS items.
      8.5.9. A staging area where hazardous materials can be segregated and stored pending
      shipment as determined by CFR 49.
8.6. OSHA and AFOSH Standards. Ensure that health and safety standards are consistent
with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and Air Force Occupational Safety
and Health (AFOSH) standards when planning the type and layout of facilities and equipment.
See Chapter 17 for guidelines.
8.7. Packaging Cost Control. Major commands must establish procedures to ensure that all
bases under their jurisdiction include necessary packaging requirements for all procurements.
      8.7.1. Local Purchase Items. As a rule, code items bought at base level for local purchase
      (LP) are intended for immediate use. In most cases, the vendor or manufacturer standard
      packaging adequately protects these items; you may use this packaging if it meets 49 CFR
      requirements and safety standards. Purchasing documents for LP materiel must contain the
      statement: "Military packaging is not required." The packaging provided must protect the
      item to destination and conform to applicable 49 CFR or intrastate regulations. This
      statement permits rejection of substandard packaging at delivery based on 49 CFR
      regulations.
      8.7.2. Packaging Economy. Commanders will emphasize to base personnel that protection
      of materiel enroute to the warfighters is paramount. The importance of proper packaging and
      use of economical packaging techniques can save significant Operations & Maintenance
      (O&M) funds while minimizing the creation of solid waste. Emphasize this philosophy in
      command publications and correspondence and during staff visits to the bases. Examples of
      areas where economies and improvements may be put into effect are:
         8.7.2.1. Recovery and re-use of serviceable reusable containers and packaging materials.
         8.7.2.2. Keeping specialized containers for reshipment or return of items to the using or
         repair activity.
         8.7.2.3. Standardizing the number and types of packaging materials purchased.
         8.7.2.4. Ensuring that units use materiel for its intended purpose.
         8.7.2.5. Anticipating long term requirements for reusable containers and packaging
         materials so units can purchase them in larger, more economical quantities.
         8.7.2.6. Using the lowest acceptable levels of preservation and packing to meet the
         anticipated logistics and warfighter environment.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                           83


8.8. Preserving and Packing Items of Supply and Equipment.
   8.8.1. Cleaning and Drying. Carefully clean and dry all items by any suitable process that
   does not harm the item before applying preservation techniques.
   8.8.2. Preservation. All items (serviceables, reparables, retrograde, etc.) placed in storage or
   shipped to another activity (including depot) will be preserved, as required, to prevent
   deterioration from corrosion, mildew, decay, and mold and to protect from attack by
   microorganisms, vermin, or rodent. For reparable items, preservation requirements are
   usually of a lesser degree than their serviceable counterparts because this materiel is usually
   shipped to a depot or TRC for short-term or controlled storage. However, many items do
   require the same high level of preservation protection. These include some engines,
   navigational equipment, gyros, landing gear and ESDS items. This is due to their high dollar
   value or their susceptibility to rapid deterioration and/or sensitivity to other elements. Before
   attempting to determine the Method of Preservation for any individual item, check the special
   packaging instruction and packaging requirements. If no special packaging instructions or
   packaging requirements are available, examine the characteristics of the item such as its
   physical composition and the nature of the surface or requirements for a similar item.
   Contact the prime AFGLSC packaging office for preservation and packing guidance.
      8.8.2.1. Selecting the Method of Preservation. The type of preservation required for
      items during processing varies according to the item characteristics and types of exposure
      which may be encountered, and with the materials from which they are made. A SPI or
      T.O. prescribing a method of preserving a particular item or group of items takes
      precedence over general guidelines. When you have no specific instructions, use the
      tables in MIL-STD-2073-1 to select the method/submethod of preservation and the
      container.
      8.8.2.2. Preservation methods for military packaging are standardized. There are five
      basic Methods of Preservation (MOP). These methods are known as Method 10
      (physical protection), Method 20 (preservative coating only, with greaseproof wrap as
      required), Method 30 (waterproof or waterproof-greaseproof protection), Method 40
      (watervaporproof protection with preservative as required) and Method 50
      (watervaporproof protection with desiccant). Refer to MIL-STD-2073-1 for various
      specific techniques on these methods of preservation, general requirements and suggested
      methods of application. Additionally, MIL-STD-2073-1 specifies specialized military
      preservation requirements for items with specific characteristics such as ESDS
      Electromagnetic Impulse (EMI) materiel.
      8.8.2.3. Preserving Items for Shipment or Storage. When preserving items for shipment
      or storage:
          8.8.2.3.1. Use a preservative whose application, use, or removal will not damage the
          item or impair item function. For example, do not use petroleum-based preservatives
          on rubber or fabric products.
          8.8.2.3.2. Directly after cleaning and drying of the item, the preservative (where
          required) shall be uniformly applied by any appropriate procedure that permits
          coating all necessary surfaces and wrapped as required..
          8.8.2.3.3. Properly cushion, block, or brace the item in the unit container.
 84                                         AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


             8.8.2.3.4. If the item is to be exposed directly to precipitation, an over-wrap of
             appropriate conforming barrier material should be used, otherwise any other usual
             method of supplying physical protection will be sufficient.
             8.8.2.3.5. Ensure that all materials used in cleaning, drying, preserving, wrapping,
             cushioning and packing are clean and free from defects.
             8.8.2.3.6. General knowledge of the composition, characteristics, intended uses and
             methods of application of packaging materials (preservation) is found in AFPAM(I)
             24-237, Packaging of Materiel, Preservation.
8.9. Packing.
      8.9.1. DOD Levels of Packing. DOD established two levels of packing: A and B. These
      packing levels, defined in MIL-STD-2073-1 and AFMAN 24-206_IP, guide military
      components and their commercial industry suppliers in determining the required protection.
      Attachment 3 provides a table of common applications for the levels of packing.
         8.9.1.1. Level A. Packing protection required to meet the most severe worldwide
         shipment, handling and storage conditions. Level A packs must, in tandem with the
         applied preservative, be capable of protecting materiel from the effects of direct exposure
         to extremes of climate, transportation, terrain and operational environments.
         8.9.1.2. Level B. Packing protection required to moderate worldwide shipment, handling
         and storage conditions. Level B packs must, in tandem with the applied preservative, be
         capable of protecting materiel from the effects of indirect exposure to extremes of
         climate, transportation, terrain and operational environments.
      8.9.2. Guidance Sources for Packing. A SPI, T.O., or other service/agency approved
      document/drawing takes priority over general instructions. In the case that SPI and T.O.
      guidance differ, SPI requirements take precedence over T.O.s or other documents. The
      prime AFGLSC Packaging Specialist will formally coordinate with the responsible
      Equipment Specialist to review weapon system specific T.O.s as applicable. The AFGLSC
      Packaging Specialist, Equipment Specialist and T.O. Manager shall coordinate necessary
      actions to ensure SPIs and T.O.s are congruent with respect to Packaging, Handling, Storage
      & Transportation PHS&T requirements. If a SPI or T.O. does not provide specific guidance,
      use:
         8.9.2.1. MIL-STD-2073-1 to identify and select the unit and intermediate containers,
         preservation, wrap, cushioning and dunnage requirements.
         8.9.2.2. T.O. 00-85-B-3, How to Package Air Force Spares, to identify and select Fast
         Pack and Standard Pack details on packing.
      8.9.3. Primary and Alternate Packs.
         8.9.3.1. Give only one SPI number for NSNs assigned to the primary SPI.
         8.9.3.2. For long-life and short-life containers prescribed for the same item, specify them
         in the same SPI. The long-life container is the primary pack and the short-life container
         is the alternate pack.
8.10. How to Pack Items. Packaging must prevent damage or harm to items during storage,
issue or transfer. Depot reparable items shall have a SPI assigned, whether drawing, Fast Pack
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                        85


or Standard Pack and must be SPI packed accordingly regardless of materiel condition. Other
non-depot reparable items, based on their physical characteristics, can also be SPI pa cked. Pack
single items according to the applicable SPI or T.O., unless otherwise directed by waiver
authority to deviate. Waivers are issued from the prime AFGLSC packaging office for specific
weapon system assets that they manage. The prime AFGLSC packaging office can be found in
SPIRES under the Source Of Supply (SOS). If an item is not assigned a SPI and no packaging
data is available, contact the prime AFGLSC packaging office for packing guidance. The prime
AFGLSC packaging office will provide guidance regarding the use of appropriate cushioning
and container to pack and protect the item and for establishment of packaging data requirements.
When consolidating two or more packed line items in a single container, place the heaviest or
most dense items in the bottom. Avoid packing light, fragile items in the same pack with heavy,
rugged items. Arrange the contents of the pack to provide the greatest protection to the interior
packages. Reference paragraph 8.10.20.2., for additional guidance on container consolidation.
   8.10.1. Hazardous Materials and Regulated Articles. Hazardous materials must be
   preserved, packed, and marked according to the applicable directives specified in for
   hazardous materials and hazardous waste. Unitization procedures in this document do not
   apply to the materials regulated by AFMAN 24-204_IP.
   8.10.2. Reparable Returns and Retrograde Shipments. All reparable returns and retrograde
   materiel shall be cleaned and dried before TO acceptance, preserved as required, packed and
   marked before being shipped. Materiel shall be packed in their assigned SPIs or Fast Pack
   reusable containers, unless otherwise directed by waiver authority to deviate. Authorized
   packaging, handling, storage & transportation (PHS&T) deviations for Fast Packs and
   Standard Packs when the correct size is unavailable for transportation priority 1 and 2
   shipments of unserviceable and serviceable items are as follows: 1) Use of the next larger
   size of Type I (Vertical Star Pack) or Type II (Folding Convoluted Pack), provided there is
   no decrease in any of the container dimensions; and 2) Use of next larger size standard pack
   containers. A complete list of Fast Pack and Standard Pack types and sizes can be found in
   T.O. 00-85B-3. The item must be wrapped sufficiently to build up the item so it fills up the
   cavity. Cushion, block, and brace each reparable item for return to depot or TRC. Units shall
   give repairable items the prescribed packaging protection requirements to prevent damage or
   deterioration during intra-base handling and shipment to the prime ALC depot or TRC.
   When moving reparable items intra-base (on-base) or inter-base (between bases), transport
   them in the assigned container, specified SPI pack or equivalent handling device. If the
   assigned container is not available, scope the Reusable Container Worldwide Warehouse
   (RECON) system for lateral support or contact the prime AFGLSC packaging office for
   requesting waiver authority to deviate for authorized shipments of an equivalent or suitable
   substitute container. A waiver authority number to deviate and applicable instructions will
   be provided. Additional guidance on waiver authority to deviate is found in Chapter 9.
       8.10.2.1. Use the replacement part package to repackage the reparable item for return
       shipment. If a SPI or T.O. contains packaging instructions, comply with the applicable
       document.
   8.10.3. Wood Packaging Material (WPM) Restrictions.
       8.10.3.1. The United Nations (UN) International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC)
       imposed restrictions for WPM to mitigate the risk of introducing plant pests, including
86                                       AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


     pathogens, that can be harmful to agriculture and to natural, cultivated and urban forest
     resources. DOD components engaged in the packaging of materiel for international
     shipment must comply with the UNIPPC requirements in order for shipments to move
     internationally unimpeded. WPM is defined as wood or wood products (excluding paper
     products) used in supporting, protecting or carrying a commodity (includes dunnage).
     This includes, but is not limited to, wood pallets, skids, crates, load boards, pallet collars,
     wooden boxes, reels and dunnage.
     8.10.3.2. DOD shipments departing or returning to the United States containing WPM
     must be treated for compliance IAW IPPC International Standards for Phytosanitary
     Measures (ISPM) Number 15. WPM must consist of the use of debarked wood (with a
     specified tolerance for remaining bark) in addition to "Kiln Dried (KD)" or "Heat Treated
     (HT)" to a standard core temperature of 56 degrees Centigrade (133 degrees Fahrenheit)
     for 30 minutes. It should be emphasized that the heat treatment standard is that the "core"
     of the wood reaches 56 degrees Centigrade for 30 minutes. The specified tolerance for
     remaining bark is any number of visually separate and clearly distinct small pieces of
     bark may remain if they are less than 3 cm in width (regardless of the length or greater
     than 3 cm in width, with the total surface area of an individual piece of bark less than 50
     square cm. Compliant non-manufactured WPM is marked either heat-treated or KD/HT
     as established by American Lumber Standards Committee, Incorporated (ALSC) or
     treated (fumigated) with methyl bromide (MB) as established by National Wood Pallet
     and Container Association (NWPCA). In addition to the debarked wood and HT
     standard, the WPM must be permanently marked with an approved ISPM 15 or DOD
     Pest Free certification stamp by trained and certified DOD personnel. Fumigation by MB
     is not authorized unless specifically approved by the Service or Agency Senior
     Acquisition Official and the Component WPM Program Manager.
     8.10.3.3. WPM exempt from these requirements are materials that have gone through a
     manufacturing (finished) process (i.e., corrugated fiberboard, plywood, particleboard,
     veneer, and oriented strand board (OSB)), pieces of wood less than 6mm (.024 in) in any
     dimension, and ―loose wood packing materials‖ as defined in 7 CFR Part 319.40-1.
     Examples of loose WPM include excelsior wool (wood wool), sawdust, and wood
     shavings, produced as a result of sawing or shaving wood into small, slender and curved
     pieces. Dunnage is not always loose wood packing materials; when it is not, it must meet
     the WPM requirements.
        8.10.3.3.1. When building plywood boxes, if the plywood is nailed to solid wood
        frames or contains solid wood cleats, the boxes must also meet the WPM
        requirements.
     8.10.3.4. The WPM requirements apply to all DOD shipments worldwide.
     8.10.3.5. Any activity purchasing WPM for use in building or assembling packaging will
     comply with the following requirements for purchasing the wood. If WPM is already
     ISPM 15 stamped, re-marking with the DOD Pest Free stamp is not required, unless the
     ISPM 15 marks are cut off.
        8.10.3.5.1. All wooden pallets and wood containers produced of WPM shall be
        constructed from heat treated (HT to 56 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes) material
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                       87


        and certified by an accredited agency recognized by the American Lumber Standards
        Committee (ALSC) in accordance with the IIPPC ISPM 15.
        8.10.3.5.2. All WPM purchased outside of the United States must be in compliance
        with the WPM requirements. Ensure the WPM is permanently marked with the
        country‘s authorized ISPM 15 certification mark.
     8.10.3.6. All Air Force activities responsible for establishing preservation and packing
     requirements for contracts resulting in delivery of any product to the Air Force must
     ensure WPM in new contracts include the requirements outlined above. Additionally, all
     existing contracts (including contracts administered by DCMA) and delivery orders that
     result in deliveries to the DOD must be modified to reflect the requirements above.
     8.10.3.7. KD/HT or HT lumber; or KD/HT or HT WPM must be stored separately from
     any non-KD/HT or HT lumber; or non-KD/HT or HT WPM. A minimum segregation of
     four feet is recommended in storage and warehouse conditions to avoid intermingling of
     stock.
     8.10.3.8. Air Force activities shall keep documentation identifying all lumber or WPM
     procured which meets the above KD/HT or HT requirement. WPM records retention at
     each certified site shall be for a period of not less than two years. This information will
     be required for audit purposes. As a minimum, these records will identify:
        8.10.3.8.1. Purchase Order/Requisition/Receipt and Quantity of KD/HT or HT
        lumber or KD/HT or HT WPM purchased.
        8.10.3.8.2. Work order(s) or other documentation that identifies amount of board feet
        (ft) used.
        8.10.3.8.3. Procedures for the control of the ISPM 15 and DOD Pest Free
        certification stamps. Certification stamps must be secured to ensure only certified
        personnel use them.
        8.10.3.8.4. Training certifications for any person authorized to use the IPPC and
        DOD certification stamps.
     8.10.3.9. Existing or previously packaged material can be tested, inspected and certified
     as pest free by DOD shipping activities if the WPM meets one of the following
     requirements:
        8.10.3.9.1. If the pack date is less than five years and is not packaged in compliant
        WPM, it will be inspected to ensure the WPM is bark free, contains no bore holes
        larger than 3mm, and the moisture content is less than 20 percent.
        8.10.3.9.2. If the pack date is five years or older (that can be verified/validated), it
        will be inspected ensuring the WPM is bark free, contains no bore holes larger than
        3mm, and is not infested by pests. Moisture content test is not required.
        8.10.3.9.3. When the WPM is inspected as authorized in paragraphs 8.10.3.9.1. and
        8.10.3.9.2. above and found compliant, the WPM will be permanently marked with
        the DOD Pest Free mark. The IPPC international mark may not be used for this
        inspection and certification process.
 88                                     AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


      8.10.3.10. When the WPM is inspected and certified as authorized in paragraphs
      8.10.3.9.1. and 8.10.3.9.2. above, the following information for each shipment must be
      maintained:
         8.10.3.10.1. NSN
         8.10.3.10.2. Quantity
         8.10.3.10.3. TCN
         8.10.3.10.4. Tested Moisture Percentage
      8.10.3.11. Visual inspection of the wood must confirm the WPM contains no bore or
      grub holes larger than 3mm and no presence of visible bark.
      8.10.3.12. Previously packaged material that fails any of the requirements above must be
      repackaged using HT compliant WPM.
      8.10.3.13. Any new container/pallet must be constructed/repaired with only debarked
      and KD/HT or HT wood that meets the requirements above.
      8.10.3.14. WPM Markings.
         8.10.3.14.1. The DOD Pest Free mark is accepted by USDA APHIS and US Customs
         and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security for imports
         into CONUS of retrograde materiel packaged in/on WPM. The DOD Pest Free mark
         is to be used for imports back into CONUS. Temporary and emergency situations
         may warrant this certification mark process. The DOD Pest Free process is to be
         used: when there are no established host nation ISPM 15 programs (non-signatory
         ISPM 15 country); when there are austere conditions; when the deploying force will
         occupy the location for a limited time (less than 180 days); when the WPM brought
         with the deploying force will be returning directly to CONUS; or when importing
         back into CONUS existing WPM stored at an OCONUS location with a valid date of
         pack earlier than 31 Dec 07. Existing or previously packaged materiel that passes the
         tests and visual inspections will be permanently marked (stenciled, branded or
         stamped) in a visible location, preferably on at least two opposite sides of the article,
         with the DOD Pest Free mark. Use the activity DODAAC where required as
         identified in Figure 8.1.

         8.10.3.14.2. WPM (pallets, containers, reels, boxes, crates, etc.) assembled/built at an
         Air Force (including AFRC and ANG) installation utilizing debarked wood in
         addition to KD/HT or HT compliant lumber will be permanently marked (stenciled,
         branded or stamped) with the ISPM 15 mark. Unit loads of multiple containers may
         be marked using marking boards and placed on two opposite sides of the load.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                      89


         Wooden pallets will be marked on two stringers, opposite sides. DOD Components
         that are self-certified or ALSC accredited are authorized to use the ISPM No. 15
         certification mark on all WPM that fully complies with ISPM No. 15 guidelines. The
         ISPM No. 15 self-certification marking (see Figure 8.1) shall display the letters ―US‖
         in bold (a), the packaging activity‗s Department of Defense Activity Address Code
         (DODAAC) (b), and either ―HT‖ denoting heat treated WPM or ―MB‖ denoting
         WPM ―fumigated with Methyl Bromide as noted in the Figure 8.2 by ―HT‖(c). Item
         (e) is the approved International symbol for compliant wood packaging material. No
         extraneous markings are authorized within the border of the certification mark.
         Outside the border of the certification mark will include the TRADEMARK (a) which
         represents the logo of the U.S. services and will be displayed as shown. DOD
         Components are only authorized to use the ―DOD‖ (a) as the DOD trademark when
         self-certifying. The marking ―DUN‖ (f) is used strictly for dunnage, otherwise it is
         left blank. DoD Components that are ALSC accredited may only use and apply the
         certification marking supplied by ALSC under contract. Previous versions of the
         certification markings may be used until the marking device becomes worn and no
         longer provides a clear mark. The exception is branding irons, where the marking
         plate must be changed to the new marking design not later than 1 Jan 2013.

        IAW MIL-STD-129.
     8.10.3.15. Management Controls. Air Force activities shall report, audit and enforce
     WPM standards and measures. Each Air Force activity shall register their DODAAC and
     WPM         Site     Custodian(s)      via     the     DOD       WPM     System   at
     https://tarp.navsisa.navy.mil/wpm. Installations that have two or more packaging
     mission support activities, identified by separate DODAACs, shall have separate WPM
     programs in terms of custodial management controls. Accordingly, each activity shall
     register their DODAAC and WPM site custodians via the DOD WPM Management
     Toolset, maintain separate WPM certification marks with the packaging activity‗s
     DODAAC and execute custodial management controls and reporting requirements. Each
     activity shall provide monthly reports as indicated below to the DOD WPM Management
     Toolset within two weeks (14 days) of the reported month. WPM
        8.10.3.15.1. WPM Site Custodian(s) Reporting. Air Force activities shall provide
        two mandatory monthly reports to the DOD WPM System Toolset: 1) Lumber usage
        monthly report; and 2) DOD Pest Free monthly report. The reports must be posted to
        the DOD WPM System within two weeks (14 days) of the reported month. If the
        DOD Pest Free stamp is not utilized, custodians will zero-out the numbers on the
        applicable DOD Pest Free monthly report. The following reporting requirements are
        required:
            8.10.3.15.1.1. Activities using the DOD Pest Free certification will maintain
            records of certified materiel by documenting the following information:
               8.10.3.15.1.1.1. Requisition number, item NSN, moisture reading, visually
               inspected for boreholes over 3mm in diameter (Yes/No), quantity of WPM
               marked, inspector‘s signature verifying WPM meets DOD requirements and
               WPM is properly marked, and the date of certification.
            8.10.3.15.1.2. Activities fabricating new WPM or repairing WPM with new
            lumber and applying the IPPC certification mark will track the following:
               8.10.3.15.1.2.1. Lumber receipts including the receipt or requisition number,
               mill code, lumber NSN or identification number, lumber thickness, lumber
               width, lumber length, quantity received and date of receipt.
               8.10.3.15.1.2.2. Lumber used including the cut and fabrication work order,
               lumber NSN or identification number, lumber thickness, lumber width,
               lumber length, quantity received and date of fabrication.
               8.10.3.15.1.2.3. A lumber usage report will be prepared identifying the
               lumber on hand at the beginning of the month, lumber received, lumber used,
               and final inventory of lumber on hand at the end of the month.
        8.10.3.15.2. WPM Site Audit Inspections. Appointed and certified WPM Site
        Auditors shall perform annual on-site audits. WPM Site Auditors shall not be
        assigned to the Deployment and Distribution Flight. The WPM Audit Inspection
        Checklist is found in Appendix 4. WPM Site Auditors will verify the site
        documentation records are accurate and on file in the packaging and preservation
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                     91


       office and/or cargo movement element of the TO. WPM annual audits shall be
       accomplished for the following year and entered in the DOD WPM Management
       Toolset NLT 14 Jan.
          8.10.3.15.2.1. WPM audit results shall be posted to the WPM system toolset
          within two weeks (14 days) of the reported month. Installations that have
          completed three consecutive compliant monthly WPM audits on time will be
          going to quarterly audits. Installations that have completed two consecutive
          compliant quarterly WPM audits will be going to semi-annual audits. Following
          are the schedules for quarterly and semi-annual audits:

       8.10.3.15.3. Consequences of Audit Failure/Non-Compliance.
          8.10.3.15.3.1. All commercial and Air Force activities responsible for repairing
          or fabricating WPM resulting in Air Force transnational cargo movement to
          American Lumber Standards Committee (ALSC)/National Wood Pallet and
          Container Association (NWPCA) requirements shall receive warnings,
          suspensions and withdrawal of ALSC stamp marking privileges for non-
          compliance as specified in ALSC/NWPCA enforcement regulations.
          8.10.3.15.3.2. At DOD site-certified WPM activities, the following procedures
          apply to audit failures or reported non-compliance:
             8.10.3.15.3.2.1. First Audit Failure/Reported Non-Compliance. The WPM
             site auditor and/or custodian, after notification of the first audit failure/non-
             compliance, shall provide within 15 days written analysis of the problem and
             proposed resolution to the responsible MAJCOM WPM Program Manager
             and to the Air Force WPM Component Manager. The site shall be re-audited
             within 30 days to ensure process improvements have been implemented and
             are sufficient to resolve the discrepancy.
             8.10.3.15.3.2.2. Second Audit Failure/Reported Non-Compliance. A second
             audit failure/non-compliance within the 30 days requires further involvement:
               8.10.3.15.3.2.2.1. Provide within 15 days written analysis of the problem
               and proposed resolution to the MAJCOM WPM Program Manager, Air
               Force WPM Component Manager and HAF/A4LM.
92                                        AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


                     8.10.3.15.3.2.2.2. The MAJCOM WPM Program Manager or the Air Force
                     WPM Component Manager shall re-audit the site within 60 days to ensure
                     process improvements have been implemented to resolve the discrepancy.
                     8.10.3.15.3.2.2.3. Third Audit Failure/Reported Non-Compliance. A third
                     audit failure/non-compliance within the 60 days requires greater
                     involvement:
                        8.10.3.15.3.2.2.3.1. If the failure/non-compliance results from WPM
                        documentation (records) maintenance or to contract for the delivery of
                        the proper WPM, the DOD site certification shall be withdrawn. The
                        facility shall contact ALSC to perform monthly commercial inspections,
                        contract with a local ALSC operation, or ship materiel to another DOD
                        self-certified site. All costs associated with actions resulting from a
                        third failure shall be the responsibility of the facility.
                        8.10.3.15.3.2.2.3.2. If the failure/non-compliance is related to the
                        shipment of defective packaging, the installation/shipper shall be
                        responsible for repackaging costs (and associated demurrage). All
                        installation personnel shall have their DOD site certifications removed
                        and shall be required to successfully re-accomplish the online WPM
                        certification training prior to reauthorization to apply the certification
                        marks.
                        8.10.3.15.3.2.2.3.3. The site may reapply for DOD site certification
                        after one (1) year. All wood packing and fabrication personnel shall be
                        required to successfully re-accomplish the online WPM certification
                        training for site re-certification.
        8.10.3.16. WPM Training Requirements. Personnel involved in audit inspections,
        remediation and marking of WPM must successfully complete the DOD Self-
        Certification qualification training (initial) and refresher training every two years. DOD
        Self-Certification training will be accomplished via DOD WPM System at:
        https://www.icptarp.net/wpm/wpm_training.nsf . Additional information on the DOD
        certification training information is available by contacting (717) 605-2784. Only
        personnel who have successfully completed the above training may apply the above
        certification markings. Successfully completed training shall be documented and
        maintained in the employees training records.
     8.10.4. Security Assistance such as Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Military Assistance
     Program (MAP). Security Assistance items, including FMS, are especially susceptible to
     damage due to unknown and unfavorable transportation, climatic, and storage conditions.
     Provide military packing protection (Level A) when outdoor storage conditions are
     anticipated and military packing protection (Level B) when indoor storage conditions are
     anticipated, unless otherwise directed by the procuring country.
     8.10.5. Parcel Post Shipments. Envelopes and tapes used to seal packages must be capable
     of absorbing a postmark.
     8.10.6. Electrostatic Discharge Sensitive (ESDS) Items. Weapon systems are controlled by
     increasingly complex microcircuits composed of components that require ESD protection to
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                         93


  prevent damage caused by transient electrical overstress. Never handle ESDS items,
  regardless of condition, without their protective packaging except at a grounded ESD
  workstation. T.O. 00-25-234, Section VII, Electrostatic Discharge Control, provides specific
  guidelines for protecting electrical and electronic parts, assemblies, and equipment. It also
  contains guidance on ESD protective workstations. SPIs specify packaging requirements for
  ESD depot reparables.
     8.10.6.1. For "Black Box" items, follow the guidance outlined in T.O. 00-25-234. For
     complete system assemblies (black box LRU, SRU, Test & Repair Equipment- level),
     conductive caps/plugs serve as an electro-static shield against static fields or discharges
     to the item. ESD susceptibility stops when the level of assembly is such that a complete
     electro-static shield exists around the device. These complete system assemblies do not
     require ESD wraps/bags for intra-base transport between Maintenance and Deployment
     and Distribution. Connectors or plugs (power or data transfer) must be covered with
     conductive caps/plugs for any ESDS end item. The metal chassis or frame acts as a
     Faraday cage or electrostatic shield. Conductive caps or plugs shall be used to complete
     the Faraday cage. Without proper conductive caps or plugs, the connectors serve as an
     induction (pathway) in which ESD pulses can travel. T.O. 00-25-234, Table 7-3, lists
     various cap or plug sizes, conductive materials and substitutes.
     8.10.6.2. ESD items shall be properly packaged and handled by personnel
     knowledgeable in ESD precautionary procedures.
     8.10.6.3. In all cases, ESD items shall be properly packaged in ESD protective
     packaging to prevent damage during return to depot or TRC.
     8.10.6.4. Use care in opening ESD items. ESD bags are usually constructed with enough
     extra material to allow for at least one additional heat seal, thereby facilitating re-use in
     the maintenance activity.
     8.10.6.5. Identify ESD items by Type Cargo Code ―3‖ on DD Form 1348-1A and by
     special interior and exterior markings. These markings may include the yellow sensitive-
     electronic-device caution label or symbol. You do not need to repackage ESD items
     packaged before 1 November 1983.
  8.10.7. Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE).
     8.10.7.1. All IPE shall be cleaned, dried, preserved and packaged in accordance with
     MIL-STD-107J, Preparation and Handling of Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE) for
     Shipment and Storage. Guidance for equipment disassembly, cleaning, weatherproofing,
     skidding, preservation, packing protection and approved methods for preparing
     Government-owned IPE for shipment and storage are outlined therein.
     8.10.7.2. Use MIL-STD-107J in conjunction with MIL-HDBK-701, Blocking, Bracing
     and Skidding of Industrial Plant Equipment for Shipment and Storage. The use of DOD
     reusable skids in accordance with MIL-STD-701 is a cost savings effort by the
     Government. Direct any proposed deviation from the use of DOD reusable skids for
     equipment weighing 42,000 pounds or less to the Defense Supply Center Richmond,
     ATTN: DSCR-VBD, 8000 Jefferson Davis Highway, Richmond, VA. 23297-5610.

      8.10.8. Protecting Metallurgical Failure Exhibits. DD Form 2332, Product Quality
      Deficiency Report Exhibit, must accompany such exhibits. Do not let the packaging and
      handling prevent accurate metallurgical failure analysis. These rules apply:
         8.10.8.1. Do not clean or apply acid to the fracture except for exhibits shipped from
         overseas. Clean exhibits from overseas activities only when necessary to satisfy public
         health requirements. Take care to prevent damage to evidence during cleaning. Foreign
         products on the fracture may aid analysis.
         8.10.8.2. Do not touch the fracture face with fingers, tools, or instruments.
         8.10.8.3. Protect the fracture face from the environment, particularly where corrosion
         can occur. Do not apply preservatives to the fracture face; they could interfere with
         analysis.
         8.10.8.4. Store them in a desiccated, watervapor proof bag, fabricated from MIL-PRF-
         131 barrier material or equivalent. Seal the bag airtight. Include only one item per
         watervaporproof bag.
         8.10.8.5. If the exhibit is shipped intact rather than in parts, do not disassemble or
         otherwise compromise the exhibit unit. Ship the entire exhibit unit in the container.
         8.10.8.6. If the item is bent or broken, use a shipping container large enough to prevent
         rearranging or disturbing the bent or broken area.
         8.10.8.7. Pack items to prevent damage to the exhibit evidence during shipment. If you
         pack more than one exhibit in a single container, be sure to package exhibits separately
         and use cushioning or wrap to prevent contact between each exhibit.
NOTE: T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System, contains
further guidance on protecting metallurgical failure exhibits and marking exhibits for material
deficiency reports.
      8.10.9. War Reserve Materiel (WRM), Readiness Spares Package (RSP) and On-Board
      Spares (OBS):
         8.10.9.1. Give WRM level A or B packing accordingly (see Attachment 3), unless
         otherwise specified by the IM or prime AFGLSC packaging office.
         8.10.9.2. These requirements, or those specified by the IM or prime AFGLSC packaging
         office, apply even when the packaging and/or maintenance activities packs the items for
         deployment or mobility within kits or mobility bins (e.g. Cadillac bins). Internal packing
         of assets in SPI reusable containers must remain intact. Specifically, do not remove the
         assets from their prescribed SPI reusable containers. Stuffing assets in mobility bins
         without their SPI reusable containers (with only bubble-wrap cushioning) is a major
         contributing factor in subjecting these assets to damage from adverse shock and
         vibration. Bubble-wrap is authorized only for use as additional cushioning to fill void
         spaces inside the mobility bins.
         8.10.9.3. Keep serviceable and/or depot reparable WRM, RSP, OBS or other critical
         spare assets in their prescribed SPI/Fast Packs to ensure protection during
         deployment/mobility and to provide packs for retrograde reparables from forward
         deployed locations. The prime AFGLSC packaging office will assist with proposed
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                         95


     reconfigured SPI pack inserts to accommodate OBS due to on-board aircraft space
     constraints.
     8.10.9.4. Do not stock packaging materials as WRM, unless otherwise directed by Unit
     Type Codes (UTCs). However, ensure that spare reusable containers are available at
     forward deployed locations during follow-on RSP for retrograde Not Mission Capable
     Supply (NMCS)/MICAP mission support to the prime ALC depot or TRC.
     8.10.9.5. OCONUS bases may maintain up to a 60-day level of bench stock of packaging
     materials, based on current usage.
     8.10.9.6. CONUS bases must maintain at least a 30-day supply.
     8.10.9.7. The MAJCOM may approve storage of additional materials at the base or
     within the region.
  8.10.10. Uncrated Shipments. Crate items to facilitate handling and item protection. A
  qualified carrier certified to transport uncrated items may ship those uncrated large items that
  require special handling. Obtain lists of qualified carriers from Surface Deployment and
  Distribution Command (SDDC) area offices or on the SDDC website at:
  https://mustang.eta.sddc.army.mil/ccp/jsp/ApprovedCarrierList.jsp.                For further
  guidance regarding route requests and requirements, contact SDDC Freight Routing
  Department at (757) 878-1800. You may load packaged items in a vehicle partly filled with
  uncrated items.
     8.10.10.1. Criteria for Large Items. Activities may ship large uncrated items, unless
     otherwise specified by a SPI or palletized unit load marking drawings, and shall comply
     with the following criteria:
         8.10.10.1.1. The cost of packaging and shipping by other means would cost more
         than shipping the item uncrated.
         8.10.10.1.2. The item is capable of withstanding shipment uncrated. Parts that are
         highly susceptible to damage must be removed from the major component and
         packaged properly. Then firmly attach these parts to the unit being shipped before
         releasing it to the carrier.
         8.10.10.1.3. Qualified carriers are available to handle the shipment.
         8.10.10.1.4. The item does not have a security classification that requires packing or
         crating to prevent disclosure to unauthorized personnel.
         8.10.10.1.5. The item is not hazardous cargo as classified by AFMAN 24-204_IP, the
         Department of Transportation (DOT) Title 49 (49 CFR), International Air Transport
         Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulation, or other Federal regulatory policy.
         8.10.10.1.6. SDDC approves and authorizes the shipment as required by DTR
         4500.9-R.
  8.10.11. Handling.
     8.10.11.1. Opening and Unpacking. To optimize re-use, carefully open and unpack
     materiel to prevent damage to fiberboard containers and their components. Do not strip
     old tapes and labels from fiberboard containers; it can delaminate (peel the protective
96                                         AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


        layers off) the container and reduce the serviceable life. Prevent obliteration of stenciled
        information (e.g. SPI number, NSN, dimensions, POP markings, etc.) located on most
        containers. Carefully cut open the flaps by shallowly cutting along the tape line. Cut off
        loose ends of existing tape. Carefully remove all protruding nails, staples, metal
        strapping, and other sharp metal objects. Put all container components inside, or attach
        them to, the container so they do not get lost. Tape over the original tapes and place the
        new label over the old.
        8.10.11.2. Closure, Reinforcement and Sealing. Closure, sealing and reinforcement for
        shipment and storage will be accomplished as required and specified by ASTM D5118
        and PPP-B-1672, depending on the container type, levels of protection and preservation
        methods. The tape used for reinforcement and sealing shall be of the specification, type
        and size specified for each category and type of box. Adhesives will not be used to close
        Fast Packs or standard packs. Do not use staples or glue to make the final closure of Fast
        Packs and standard packs. Surfaces to which tape for closure is to be applied must be
        free of loose soil, oil, or grease. These surfaces should be wiped clean prior to
        application of tape. Guidelines are also specified in T.O. 00-85B-3.
     8.10.12. Marking and Labeling.
        8.10.12.1. MIL-STD-129, Marking for Shipment and Storage.               This document
        establishes procedures for marking military supplies and equipment for shipment and
        storage. Specifications, T.O.s, drawings, and SPIs may also contain special marking
        requirements. All surfaces to be marked shall be in a condition so that markings remain
        permanent, legible, and non-fading. Old markings and labels not applicable to the
        shipment shall be obliterated (blank out, cover with paint, stencil ink, etc.). Do not
        obliterate United Nations specification packaging markings or Fast Pack and Standard
        Pack markings that identify the container IAW T.O. 00-85B-3. In all cases except those
        described in this section, comply with MIL-STD 129. Reference the Training Template
        on Container Reuse and Marking Obliteration found on the Packaging Community of
        Practice                      (CoP)                     website                      at:
        https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/cfm/TrainingTemplateOnContainerReuse.doc
        8.10.12.2. Multipack Shipments.       Mark all consolidated shipping containers
        "Multipack." Include level of packing, date of pack, and gross weight and cubic
        measurements instead of content and identification markings. MIL-STD-129 contains
        marking requirements for multipack shipments including those containing shelf-life or
        warranty items. Multipacks containing properly packaged ESD sensitive items do not
        require ESD markings on the exterior multipack container. If a consolidation container
        contains a unit container marked "FRAGILE," do not put "FRAGILE" labels on the
        consolidation container unless the gross weight of the consolidation container is 75
        pounds (33.75 kg) or less.
        8.10.12.3. Expedite Shipment Marking. The Air Force uses two codes to identify
        expedite shipments: Code 999 and NMCS. Code 999 shipments take precedence over all
        other shipments. While both codes can apply to a single shipment, do not apply NMCS
        markings if you use 999 markings.
        8.10.12.4. Expedite Labels. Shipping documents are annotated if the shipments are a
        Mission Capable (MICAP) 999 or NMCS. The 999 and NMCS labels are commercially
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                      97


     sourced and no longer available through GSA. Use the largest size that space permits.
     Attach one label on the identification side next to the address label. Place another label
     on the opposite side of the container. Mark irregularly shaped units where shippers can
     easily see the markings. Apply as indicated in this paragraph for 999 shipments.
  8.10.13. Project Code Markings. Shipping documents tell you if the item has a project code.
  Annotate the applicable project code number in the space provided for it on the MSL IAW
  MIL-STD-129 and AFMAN 23-110. When a project code is assigned or is specified in a
  solicitation or contract, project code labels shall be applied to exterior containers. The
  project code shall appear in the address and also on a white label having a disc of a highly
  contrasting color superimposed on it. Specific guidance on applied project code markings is
  found in MIL-STD-129, Paragraph 5.2.2.
  8.10.14. Fragile Markings. When packaging conforms to specified Air Force packaging
  requirements, you do not need "fragile" markings unless prescribed by a SPI. When
  packaging does not completely conform to Air Force requirements for a specific item, the
  shipper must decide whether to use "fragile" markings.
  8.10.15. Marking and Identifying Reusable Containers.
     8.10.15.1. Mark the exterior of SPI packs and reusable contractor packs with
     "REUSABLE PACK" (except for Fast Packs, standard packs, and long-life FSC 8140
     and 8145 containers).
     8.10.15.2. Do not mark the Fast Pack containers with the complete Fast Pack SPI
     number. The Fast Pack code consists of the last three digits of the Fast Pack SPI number,
     beginning with an "X" (e.g. XE6). See PPP-B-1672 for additional Fast Pack marking
     guidance.
     8.10.15.3. Standard packs do not need to be marked with "REUSABLE PACK" or with
     the standard pack SPI number.
     8.10.15.4. Ensure that base logistics systems print the SPI number on the DD Form
     1348-1A, which provides a convenient record for identifying the item to the SPI and for
     ensuring the accuracy of the SPI number on the shipping container.
  8.10.16. Marking Component Parts of SPI Containers.
     8.10.16.1. If local units fabricate SPI packs, mark the SPI number on the exterior of the
     container before shipment.
     8.10.16.2. Keep together and mark with the SPI number the internal component parts of
     SPI containers that have complex configurations (like die-cuts or special purpose inserts)
     in the container.
     8.10.16.3. Do not obliterate Performance Oriented Packaging (POP) markings from the
     Fast Pack containers.
     8.10.16.4. Do not mark SPI numbers on Fast Packs and standard packs.
     8.10.16.5. Do not mark SPI numbers on classified shipments. See Chapter 5 for NWRM
     shipments.
 98                                        AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


      8.10.17. Marking Commercially Purchased Materiel Using the Government Purchase Card
      (GPC).
         8.10.17.1. All OCONUS shipments (particularly into contingency areas), via aerial/water
         ports and DLA Containerization and Consolidation Points (CCP), must be packaged
         appropriately for overseas shipment and marked IAW MIL-STD-129.
             8.10.17.1.1. Shipments must be clearly marked with the Ship To address (CCP
             address) and the Mark For address (the actual address of the OCONUS customer).
             Shipments must also have the Transportation Control Number (TCN), Required
             Delivery Date (RDD), Project (if any) and Transportation Priority (TP) clearly
             marked on the shipment. If shipment is moving via military airlift/sealift or CCP,
             purchasing unit must also provide a TAC to be included on the shipping label which
             will cover the cost of the transportation.
         8.10.17.2. GPC holders are directed to contact their local TO for assistance.
      8.10.18. Orientation Markings.
      8.10.18.1. This End Up - Orientation Arrows . When a shipper must carry a package of
      restricted articles in an upright position and you must mark it to that effect, use Dangerous
      Goods label ―This End Up‖ Orientation Arrows (Figure 8.3), to show how the package
      should be stowed. The label arrows must point up to indicate the top of the package.

Figure 8.3. This End Up - Orientation Arrows.




         8.10.18.2. Marking TOPHEAVY Shipments.
             8.10.18.2.1. To determine when containers or crates require top-heavy marking (in
             addition to the center of balance requirements of MIL-STD-129):
             8.10.18.2.2. Locate the center of gravity (CG) of a uniformly distributed load. To
             determine the CG, locate the side with the smallest base dimension of either the width
             (w) or the length (l) of the crate (Figures 8.4 and 8.5). When the base dimensions of
             either "w" or "l" are equal (Figure 8.4), either side will work. On the chosen side,
             draw diagonal lines from opposite corners. The intersection of the diagonal lines is
             the CG of the crate.
             8.10.18.2.3. Using the same base dimension used to find the CG, draw an equilateral
             triangle on the crate (Figures 8.4 and 8.5). If the CG is within the triangle (Figure
             8.2), the container is within the safe limits for normal handling. If the CG is not
             within the triangle (Figure 8.5), the crate is unsafe for normal handling and should be
             marked "TOPHEAVY."
             8.10.18.2.4. If the height of the crate is equal to three times the base, you must mark
             the crate "TOPHEAVY." In addition, TOPHEAVY marking is recommended any
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                      99


          time a package height is more than 48‖ and the CG is higher than 24‖ or when the
          package falls over when tipped 22 degrees or less in any direction.

Figure 8.4. Uniform Load.




Figure 8.5. Topheavy Load.




   8.10.19. Forklift Entry. You must use a captive forklift entry on crates that are unsafe for
   normal handling even when they are marked "TOPHEAVY."
   8.10.20. Unitization of Cargo. Unitization is the grouping of like or unlike items for
   shipment, kept together as a unit, until they are received by the user. Pack Air Force cargo
   into units (unitize) at the source of shipment when practical. Unitizing materiel provides
   greater efficiency and economy in handling, transporting and documenting cargo by reducing
   the number of containers that must be individually handled. Properly unitized loads reduce
   the incidents of damage, loss and pilferage. The unitization policies in this section do not
100                                     AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


  apply to hazardous materials regulated by AFMAN 24-204_IP. Unitization is practiced by
  two basic methods: palletization and consolidation.
      8.10.20.1. Palletized Loads. Unless otherwise specified, palletize materiel when:
         8.10.20.1.1. Containers do not require skids.
         8.10.20.1.2. Quantities to a destination exceed either a total of 250 pounds (112
         kilograms (kg)) excluding the pallet, or a volume of 20 cubic feet (6 cubic meters).
         8.10.20.1.3. Container size permits use of one of the pallet patterns of MIL-STD-
         147, Palletized Unit Loads.
         8.10.20.1.4. Special instructions for specific commodities take precedence over MIL-
         STD-147.
         8.10.20.1.5. Do not exceed the weight and dimensional limits of MIL-STD-147 on
         palletized loads.
         8.10.20.1.6. Use the 40 by 48-inch (101.6 by 121.9 millimeter (mm)) pallet with a
         four-way forklift entry for ease of loading and in support of NATO forces and
         wherever full four-way forklift entry is required by conventional mobile materials
         handling equipment.
         8.10.20.1.7. Keep the height of the vertical center of balance as close as possible to
         one-half the length of the pallet to obtain maximum use of the pallet with maximum
         stability for safe handling.
         8.10.20.1.8. For loading 463L pallets, refer to AMCI 24-101, Vol. 11. Technical
         aspects of 463L pallets are referenced in T.O. 35D33-2-2-2, Instructions with Parts
         Breakdown, 463L Air Cargo Pallets, Types HCU-12/E (Brownline Corporation).
      8.10.20.2. Container Consolidation. Consolidation is accomplished by placing the unit
      packages into a larger container. Consolidation containers may be constructed of
      fiberboard, paper overlaid veneer, plywood, or lumber. They may be demountable or
      non-demountable and are usually secured to a pallet or to a skidded base. Some
      consolidation containers are designed to be compatible with 463L System, while others
      may be used as inserts in transporters such as CONEX, MILVANS, or SEAVANS, or to
      be used as a separate shipping container. When practical and consistent with DOD
      Regulation 4500.9-R, consolidate containers for a single consignee overseas or, when
      advantageous, to several consignees within the CONUS. The consolidation container
      must adequately protect contents during shipment. Consolidation must not be used to
      prevent item packaging. To obtain maximum advantages of consolidation, units will:
         8.10.20.2.1. Restrict total weight and the cubic measurements of the contents so they
         do not exceed the limits prescribed for the selected container.
         8.10.20.2.2. Make sure that all of the items are packaged individually to meet the
         level of packaging required for the individual item. If a single line item is not
         assigned a SPI and no packaging data is available, then use the most appropriate
         cushioning and container to pack and protect the item.
         8.10.20.2.3. Make sure to keep the center of gravity low by placing heavy, dense
         items in the bottom of the container, braced and blocked to prevent shifting. Fill
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                        101


          voids to prevent shifting of contents. Use reclaimed cushioning or other suitable
          material that has no other reuse value. If clean scrap is not available, use fill.
          8.10.20.2.4. Assemble loose items or small unit packs of the same stock number into
          a single unit by bagging, bundling, tying, wrapping, or putting them into a carton, and
          identifying and marking the contents according to MIL-STD-129 before placing them
          in the container.
          8.10.20.2.5. Facilitate mechanical handling by placing skids on containers that have a
          gross weight greater than 250 pounds (113.40 kg), or greater than 100 pounds (45.36
          kg) if the dimensions exceed 48" x 20" (121.92 cm x 50.80 cm). Use a pallet base on
          consolidation containers that have a gross weight greater than 250 pounds (113.40 kg)
          or a gross cube greater than 20 cubic feet (0.57 cubic meters).
          8.10.20.2.6. Make sure Tri-walls and other bulk shipments are placed on skids and
          banded, as appropriate. Banding should be such that a forklift is able to get under
          and pick up from all sides of the container.
          8.10.20.2.7. Pack serviceable and unserviceable materiel separately.
   8.10.21. Preservation and Levels of Packing for Unitized Loads.
       8.10.21.1. Levels of Packing for Palletized Units Loads. You must sheath palletized unit
       loads containing Level B or commercial packs for delivery overseas. Supplement the
       fiberboard sheathing with a waterproof barrier unless known favorable storage and
       handling conditions en route to the final destination indicate you do not need to. Do not
       sheath palletized unit loads containing Level A packs destined for overseas solely for
       packaging protection. Loads destined for CONUS installations do not require sheathing
       (unless shipping tire/wheel assemblies) regardless of packing level.
   8.10.22. Preservation and Levels of Packing for Containerized Unit Loads. After
   considering the total logistics pipeline, preservation and levels of packing may be reduced
   when exterior container dimensions permit shipment in CONEXS, SEAVANS or
   MILVANS. If container service cannot be used, then allow the shipper at origin or the
   military ocean terminals to overpack exterior containers. If break-bulk and surface
   transportation is required for delivery to the user, or if storage time, storage conditions, or
   mode of transportation is unknown, then a higher level of packing must be used.
CAUTION: Containerized hazardous materials are not air-eligible cargo. See AFMAN 24-
204_IP and 49 CFR.
8.11. Using Preservative Treated Wood. Preservative treated (pressure treated) wood does not
meet the ISPM 15 standard specified in paragraph 8.10.3, unless the wood was heat treated and
stamped HT prior to preservative treatment.
   8.11.1. Generally, treat lumber and plywood with a wood preservative only when a favorable
   tradeoff in container life expectancy can justify its use and you expect to store the container
   in the open for greater than:
       8.11.1.1. Twelve months in tropical or subtropical regions (including the CONUS Gulf
       states).
102                                     AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


      8.11.1.2. Twenty-four months in temperate climates with normal rainfall (including
      CONUS Midwestern, Eastern, and Northwestern states).
      8.11.1.3. Thirty-six months in arid areas (including CONUS Southwestern states).
  8.11.2. Preserve lumber and plywood used to manufacture or fabricate containers and
  container accessories (skids, pallets, and rubbing strips) as specified in A-A-59276. Use only
  Composition C and D of TT-W-572 and copper naphthenate (CuN) or copper-8-quinolinolate
  (Cu-8) as wood preservatives. Consider using preservative-treated wood rather than
  untreated wood for the following containers and accessories:
      8.11.2.1. Reusable containers of wood construction or containing wood members.
      8.11.2.2. External wood members of metal, plastic, and fiberglass containers.
      8.11.2.3. Wood members of open crates, including blocking, bracing, and mounting
      devices.
      8.11.2.4. Wood members of wood and plywood containers and sheath crates.
      8.11.2.5. Skids, pallets, and rubbing strips, even when used with nonpressure-treated
      containers.
  8.11.3. When cutting preservative treated wood, use a bioenvironmentally approved
  ventilation system to prevent irritation from the sawdust.
  8.11.4. Insure that personnel handling wood products treated with Pentachlorophenol (penta)
  and showing signs of penta crystals use nitrile rubber or polyvinyl chloride gloves and
  chemical goggles.
      8.11.4.1. If personnel discover that penta treated items like boxes, pallets, and crates
      have crystals or blooms, remove, repackage, and return the contents to service using
      noncontaminated materials. Overpack the contaminated material in metal drums or wrap
      it in heavy plastic and report it as hazardous waste.
  8.11.5. Do not ship or store foodstuffs in preservative-treated wooden containers.
  8.11.6. NOTE: Wood products preserved with Composition C or D or TT-W-572 or CuN or
  Cu-8 do not have national stock numbers (NSNs). Order treated lumber by using the NSN
  for untreated wood with an added stipulation on the purchase order. For example, a purchase
  order requesting treated 2 by 4 lumber, must begin with the NSN for untreated 2 by 4 lumber,
  (5510-00-220-6194). Then the stipulation must be added that the wood is to be used under
  moderate weather conditions and is to be treated as specified in A-A-59276, using
  Composition C or D of TT-W-572 or CuN or Cu-8. Include such data in applicable TOs and
  SPIs if you are specifying treated lumber.

                   AIR FORCE REUSABLE CONTAINER PROGRAM

9.1. General Information.
   9.1.1. The Air Force Reusable Container Program is an efficient and effective program to
   satisfy the most demanding packaging requirements. This program is designed to pay
   minimum cost in packaging and maintaining high levels of protection for assets during
   storage or shipment. Savings in logistics costs are being realized by this program. Reusable
   containers provide superior packaging protection and performance of critical spare parts and
   increase the reliability of weapons systems. By taking maximum advantage of recovering
   and utilizing reusable containers, packaging costs are reduced, new acquisitions of expensive
   containers are minimized; materiel waste stream (disposal of cushioning) is reduced; war-
   winning capabilities are enhanced through the continuous flow of serviceable weapon system
   specific parts. Lost or missing containers slow down the flow of aircraft parts.
   9.1.2. Reusable containers are a shipping and storage container that can be reused and which
   can be repaired or retrofitted to prolong its serviceable life. Reusable containers can be
   modified for shipment of like items other than that for which it was originally intended.
   They must maintain a high rate of re-use due to the nature and value of these items and the
   Air Force‘s diverse logistical requirements. Many items can be reused after undergoing
   recalibration, repair, or retrofitting, but cannot be made serviceable by the using base. These
   items must be returned to the prime ALC depot or TRC. Such items may include reparable
   and technical order time change items. Moreover, many of these items are assigned reusable
   containers. Items that are ERRC ―T‖ coded as depot reparable shall have a SPI, whether a
   drawing, Fast Pack or Standard Pack. Other selected items that are not depot reparable can
   also be covered by SPIs based on item characteristics. Although Fast Packs and Standard
   Packs are a type of SPI, Fast Packs and Standard Packs shall not be depicted in a SPI
   drawing.     Special Packaging Instruction Retrieval & Exchange System (SPIRES)
   (https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/), provides the capability to cross-level AF and Contractor
   Supported Weapon System (CSWS) NSN to SPI data (e.g. SPI drawings, Fast Packs and
   standard packs). Additional guidance on SPIRES is found in paragraph 9.6.11. Reusable
   Container Worldwide Warehouse (RECON) (https://recon.wpafb.af.mil/), is a tool that
   cross-levels excess reusable containers and/or packaging materiel from CONUS/OCONUS
   bases, provides worldwide visibility and matches warfighters‘ reusable container needs.
   9.1.3. Intermodal containers are not covered under this program. Additional guidance on
   intermodal containers can be found in Chapter 14.
9.2. Serviceable Reusable Containers. To be serviceable, reusable containers must meet all of
the following requirements:
   9.2.1. Protect serviceable items against natural and induced environments and physical
   damage.
   9.2.2. Protect unserviceable items against further deterioration during return to the prime

   9.2.3. Be opened and closed without impairing the container's ability to provide its original
   level of protection.
   9.2.4. Have all its components and in good repair.
   9.2.5. Endure the shipping, handling and storage environment for the number of trips
   required to yield the lowest total packaging, maintenance, storage and transportation costs for
   the expected lifetime of the item it protects.
   9.2.6. Personnel who handle, package, or store reusable containers must perform visual
   examination for configuration of external packaging.
       9.2.6.1. Reusable containers used more than once shall be in such condition, including
       closure devices, cushioning materials and markings, that conform in all respects to the
       prescribed requirements of applicable directives.
       9.2.6.2. Before reuse, each reusable container shall be visually examined and shall not be
       reused unless free from damage (which reduces structural integrity) and excessive
       marking/labeling (which imposes risk for misidentification of assets).
          9.2.6.3. Containers shall not have any separation at top or bottom seams. Metal lever
          locking rings shall not show significant rusting/corrosion nor have critical
          dents/damages that would affect structural integrity. They must fit snug around the
          container and not be loose when closed. Lids shall be flat, with smooth edges that fit
          completely over the upper edge of the container. For existing containers, small dents
          and rust on the lever locking rings and/or lids are acceptable for shipment to meet
          mission needs, provided the lids will close completely with the lever locking rings to
          secure a strong tight fitting integration with the sidewalls.
          9.2.6.4. Chimes (top or bottom rings) shall not show significant rust that affect
          structural integrity. They must be unbent and firmly connected to, with no separation
          from, the container walls. Container walls shall not show any signs of collapse,
          crushing or weakening over the chimes.
          9.2.6.5. Container exterior surface shall not be unglued, have tears/cuts or significant
          peeling to the moisture laminate (delaminated), or show any signs of material
          separation, provided there is no risk of structural integrity or separation of component
          parts. Container surface shall not have any swollen or soft areas where exposure to
          moisture has weakened the walls. Containers shall not be faded or show discoloration
          that may indicate exposure to liquids or sunlight that has created structural
          weakening. Containers shall not show any signs of instability, unsteadiness or
          wobbling.
       9.2.6.6. If after using the above visual examination criteria, or if the
       reusability/serviceability of a particular container is in question, please follow the
       procedures in paragraph 9.6.13. herein. For additional guidance on reuse of different
       types of containers, reference the Training Template on Container Reuse and Marking
       Obliteration found on the Packaging Community of Practice (CoP) website at:
       https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/cfm/TrainingTemplateOnContainerReuse.doc
9.3. Categories of Reusable Containers. Reusable containers fall into four categories,
depending on the durability of the exterior shipping container and complexity of the design:
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                        105


   9.3.1. Long life containers. Effective for 100 trips minimum. A shipping container that can
   be used repeatedly and whose serviceability can be expected to equal the serviceability of the
   item it is designed to protect. These containers may be refurbished by appropriate
   maintenance practices to their original condition and re-used.
NOTE: Slotted angle crates, covered by NSNs in Federal Supply Classifications (FSC) 8140
and 8145, are long life containers. Slotted angle containers can be constructed and repaired at
base level.
   9.3.2. Short life containers. Effective for 10 trips minimum. A shipping container that can
   be re-used for a limited number of times. The container is usually made of wood, plywood,
   fiberboard or similar material that has limited serviceability.
   9.3.3. Multi-application containers. Multi-application containers are designed to protect a
   variety of components within a given fragility and size range. All multi-application
   containers are assigned a National Stock Number (NSN). A multi-application container can
   be either short life or long life. They can be manufactured in a similar manner to that used
   for specialized containers or in accordance with applicable military/federal specifications.
   Short life multi-application containers include Fast Packs, consisting of a family of standard
   size cushioned fiberboard shipping containers. Short life multi-application containers are
   designated as Types I thru IV in MIL-STD-2073-1. Long life multi-application containers
   are made of rugged plastic containing internal cushioning pads or permanent shock
   mitigation systems (e.g. shear mounts, steel coils and springs) and designed to protect
   reparable components during forward and retrograde movements within the Defense
   Transportation System (DTS). Long life multi-application containers are designated as
   Types VI thru X in MIL-STD-2073-1.
   9.3.4. Specialized Containers. Specialized containers are generally long life and are
   uniquely configured to protect a specific item, or limited variety of items during handling,
   shipping and storage or to protect personnel and equipment from hazardous contents. These
   containers are made of metal (e.g. extruded aluminum or steel), fiberglass, plastic, or other
   synthetic materials that are fabricated and produced by industrial equipment according to
   engineering specifications. Containers of this type incorporate many special features (e.g.
   energy absorbing systems, temperature control systems and permanent shock mitigation
   systems, etc.). Engineering drawings define form, fit, function, materials, tolerances and
   fabrication techniques. Internal fixtures or other fitments within result from original design
   or redesign modifications to meet specific weapon systems applications.
9.4. Types of SPI Containers. There are three types of SPI containers for Air Force depot or
TRC reparables, serviceables and other selected items:
   9.4.1. Fast Packs. Fast Pack containers are a complete shipping and storage system that
   integrates interior cushioning material with the exterior container. Fast Packs are designed
   for recovery and re-use. A key advantage of Fast Packs is versatility. About ninety (90)
   percent of the items assigned to Fast Packs are either in the slide or star type pack. The
   versatility of Fast Packs is evident when over thirty one thousand (31,000) line items can be
   packed in four (4) sizes of Type II slide packs. Complete details for the construction and
   sizes are outlined in PPP-B-1672, Box, Shipping, Reusable with Cushioning. T.O. 00-85B-3,
   How to Package Air Force Spares, describes the Fast Pack SPI numbering system and is
   used by bases in selecting the proper Fast Pack for shipment of items not covered by a SPI.
106                                      AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


  Additional detailed information regarding weight limits and fragility range of items
  applicable to these packs may be found in MIL-STD-2073-1. Fast Packs consist of four
  types. These four container types are:
      9.4.1.1. Type I (Vertical Star Pack). Consists of a polyurethane foam cushion insert with
      a die-cut, star shaped, vertical cavity and top and bottom pads of the same material
      assembled in the container. Type I is used for packaging fragile items, either rectangular
      or cylindrical in shape, such as meters, gauges and instruments (e.g. air speed indicators).
      Items packaged in this star pack type are inserted into the cavity from the top of the
      container prior to placing the top pad in place.
         9.4.1.1.1. Style A – Regular slotted carton (RSC)
         9.4.1.1.2. Style B – Double cover container (DBLCC)
         9.4.1.1.3. Style C – Modified double cover container (Mod DBLCC)
      9.4.1.2. Type II (Modified Triple Slide (Convoluted Foam) Folding Pack). Consists of a
      convoluted polyurethane foam cushion bonded to container board. This assembly is
      subsequently folded up to become the slide of a modified triple slide box. The
      cushioning provides maximum protection against shock, while holding the item in place
      by pre-compression of the convoluted tips. Type II is used for circuit boards, electronic
      modules glass envelope electronic tubes. It is also used for a variety of other items
      whose depth does not exceed the limits of the size of the containers.
      9.4.1.3. Type III (Full Telescoping Encapsulated Pack). Consists of a telescoping
      container with bonded convoluted (some end and side pads are flat sheet stock)
      polyurethane foam cushioning which forms an oblong cavity. Type III is used to pack
      black-box equipment such as receiver-transmitters, amplifiers, power supply units and
      electronic indicators.
      9.4.1.4. Type IV (Double Cover Horizontal Star Pack). Consists of a two piece (top and
      bottom) polyurethane foam insert, which forms a star shaped cavity when the two pieces
      are mated in conjunction with end pads of flat sheet stock. The insert components and
      end pads are bonded in place in a half telescoping container fabricated in accordance with
      ASTM-D5118, Type CF, Style DBLCC. The cushioning insert is similar to the Type I
      star pack insert except that it is cut along (horizontal) its greatest dimensional length to
      facilitate insertion (loading) and extraction of relatively long, rectangular or cylindrical
      items such as control generators, voltage regulators, volt-meters, electronic receivers,
      protection panels, transmitters, transformers, couplers and amplifiers.
  9.4.2. Standard Packs. Standard packs are ASTM D5118, Type RSC, Class Weather-
  Resistant fiberboard containers. Standard packs, for which the packaging components
  (including the shipping container) are standardized as to materiel and size. Appropriate items
  require less cushioning protection than Fast Pack items. The cushioning in a standard pack is
  not bonded to the container walls and varies according to the instruction code in the standard
  pack SPI number. Because many different items are assigned to each standard pack, the
  reusability is increased. An example of a standard pack number is F000004D38. Refer to
  T.O. 00-85B-3 for complete details on defining standard pack numbering positions which
  specifies packaging data (e.g. preservation code, wrap, barrier and cushioning needed and
  container size code to protect the items).
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                          107


   9.4.3. Containers requiring SPI drawings. SPI drawings are detailed packaging instructions,
   usually packaging data with 3-D drawing (graphic) illustration, used to construct
   packages/containers for items requiring special preservation, packing and protection. A SPI
   drawing generally depicts details for special blocking, bracing, cushioning, shock mounts,
   tie-down devices and positioning of the item in the package/container. Additionally, a SPI
   describes the bill of materials, container system illustrations, preservation and packaging
   requirements for one item or a limited group of items of similar form, fit and function. A SPI
   will be developed IAW MIL-STD-2073-1, paragraph E.5 Additional guidance on SPIs is
   found in MIL-STD-2073-1. SPIRES (https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/) provides bases and users
   the capability to retrieve (download) SPI drawings assigned to NSNs. Additional guidance
   on SPIRES is found in paragraph 9.6.11.
      9.4.3.1. SPI numbers follow a DOD standard numbering system with Service Designator
      + National Item Identification Number (NIIN) (e.g. F000519053).
      9.4.3.2. Refer to the SPI drawing to manufacture or fabricate the container and for
      packing the item.
9.5. Packaging Engineering and Repair Capabilities.
   9.5.1. 403 SCMS (AFPTEF) and 678 ARSS (Eglin AFB) have full container design, build,
   engineering and repair capabilities to support long life, short life, multi-application and
   specialized containers.
   9.5.2. 403 SCMS (AFPTEF), upon request on a fee-for-service basis, will provide container
   engineering design, modification, test and evaluation identified by units to accomplish
   mission requirements. Additional AFPTEF guidance is found in Chapter 10.
   9.5.3. Main Operating Bases (MOB) which have full maintenance capability may repair
   specialized long life containers and control them as an accountable item of supply.
   9.5.4. Base TOs generally do not have the resources (facilities, capability and materials) to
   design, build and repair long life and specialized containers. 9.5.5. Base TOs usually have
   the materials and capability to repair or refurbish multi-application short life containers (Fast
   Packs). Fast Packs may be refurbished by replacing serviceable parts. For example, use
   serviceable cushioning inserts from worn-out Fast Packs in other packs that need them.
9.6. Controlling Reusable Containers.
   9.6.1. AFMAN 23-110, volume 1, part 1, chapter 10, section W, Container Management,
   assigns engineering responsibility to the using systems manager (SM), or the end-article IM
   and prescribes procedures for stock listing, managing, controlling and returning containers to
   supply.
   9.6.2. AFMAN 23-110, volume I, part two, chapter 2, identifies management
   responsibilities. For items without an assigned IM, contact the AFGLSC, Product Center, or
   TRC in your geographical area.
   9.6.3. Specialized and multi-application long life containers are subject to AFMAN 23-110
   management, accountability and control procedures.
   9.6.4. Short life and multi-application short life containers are not subject to AFMAN 23-
   110 management, accountability and control procedures once issued for use.
108                                     AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


  9.6.5. Stock Listing Short Life and Multi-Application Containers. Short life and multi-
  application containers are stock listed for central buying and stocking by GSA (see T.O. 00 -
  85B-3). The prime AFGLSC packaging office works with the IM (or appropriate SM) to
  begin stock listing of these containers in FSC 8110 and 8115 when all these conditions apply:
      9.6.5.1. The volume of usage makes it economical.
      9.6.5.2. A continuing requirement exists.
      9.6.5.3. The pack has multiple applications (as in Fast Packs discussed in TO 00-85B-3).
  9.6.6. Ogden AFGLSC has prime class management responsibilities for FSC 8140
  specialized and multi-application long life containers. Warner Robins AFGLSC has prime
  class management responsibilities for FSC 8145 specialized and multi-application long life
  containers.
  9.6.7. The acquiring activity oversees testing, engineering, and renovating for surplus FSC
  8140 and 8145 containers acquired through the CDRS.
  9.6.8. The prime AFGLSC packaging office does not purchase, repair, or re-engineer FSC
  8140 and 8145 surplus reusable containers transferred to other activities.
  9.6.9. Active reusable containers include all containers for which an immediate or projected
  need exists.
      9.6.9.1. When active reusable SPI containers for most depot reparable items are empty,
      then recover and re-use them within the reusable container program.
      9.6.9.2. Some specialized long-life containers, munitions containers and engine
      containers will be turned-in to LRS Materiel Management Flight or accounted for in
      munitions and engine accounts. Containers managed within the reusable container
      program are not accounted for in special accounts or LRS Materiel Management Flight.
      They are considered a part of, and identified to, the item packed inside during shipment
      and storage. Munitions containers with budget code ―H,‖ FSC code 8140 and ERRC
      XD2 will be managed by the munitions community in CAS. Excess munitions reusable
      containers may be dispositioned for redistribution in RECON.
  9.6.10. Specialized Containers Not-In-Use. Return FSC 8140 and 8145 specialized
  containers to LRS Materiel Management Flight accountability when any of these conditions
  applies:
      9.6.10.1. Containers are not in use.
      9.6.10.2. An immediate or projected need cannot be identified.
      9.6.10.3. Containers are not managed in separate accounts (such as engines).
      9.6.10.4. When using or packaging activities turn-in unused specialized containers to
      TO, the TO reports them to the IM or SM as available for redistribution. The IM reports
      them to 678 ARSS Eglin CDRS office for redistribution.
  9.6.11. Identifying, Retrieving and Exchanging SPIs.
      9.6.11.1. Special Packaging Instructions Retrieval & Exchange System (SPIRES).
      SPIRES is used worldwide by AF units of varying types with varying missions. Units
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                      109


     can retrieve AF and CSWS managed weapon system specific SPIs 24x7 for preparing
     materiel for shipment or storage by accessing SPIRES at https://spires.wpafb.af.mil.
     9.6.11.2. SPIRES shall be used as the AF centralized electronic library for AF managed
     and AF Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) Inventory Control Points (ICPs)
     weapon system specific SPIs.
     9.6.11.3. The prime AFGLSC packaging office archives SPI drawings. As required,
     hard copies of SPIs are obtained from the prime AFGLSC packaging office when
     unavailable in SPIRES or if the internet is inaccessible. In addition, contact the prime
     AFGLSC packaging office if there are any specific questions about item(s) characteristics
     (e.g. changes in item dimensions, fragility, etc.) and their assigned SPIs or there are any
     SPI errors.
     9.6.11.4. Weapon system specific SPIs which are commonly used may be locally
     maintained for mission support, mobility, contingency planning and operational non-
     availability of computer resources (downtime). SPIs are detailed packaging instructions
     and are not considered as technical data extracts. Performing SPI reconciliation is no
     longer required.
     9.6.11.5. The prime AFGLSC packaging office SPI developers/illustrators and CSWS
     Inventory Control Points (ICP) shall exchange (upload) SPIs in SPIRES. Copies of SPIs
     can be exchanged in AutoCad DWG, Adobe Acrobat PDF and Microsoft Word DOC
     (image) formats. SPIs are retrieved and viewed by the warfighters in Adobe Acrobat
     PDF and Microsoft Word DOC format. SPIs can be queried by many different attributes
     (e.g. SPI No., NSN, FSC, NIIN, MMAC and SOS).
     9.6.11.6. The SPIRES database stores and displays information from the depot D035T
     (Packaging, Transportation and Regulated Material) item records along with SPI
     attributes exchanged by the prime AFGLSC packaging office developers/illustrators who
     draw up the SPIs. This data system interface process enables any discrepancies or data
     inconsistencies to be flagged for resolution by the prime AFGLSC packaging office.
     9.6.11.7. Jet and reciprocating aircraft engines and certain munitions, are exceptions to
     the SPI system. T.O. 00-85-20, Engine Shipping Instructions, identifies containers for
     engines.
     9.6.11.8. The Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) stores the SPI number as part of the
     item record, and prints them in-the-clear on off-base issue, due-out release, and shipment
     documents. SBSS receives the SPI number through the Stock Number User Directory
     (SNUD) and depot D035T system interface.
     9.6.11.9. The SBSS computer will store and print SPI numbers and other packaging
     instructions in "Freight Classification Nomenclature" block of the DD Form 1348-1A.
     These entries will be followed by the Routing Identifier Code (RIC) of the prime
     AFGLSC packaging office managing the SPI. The SBSS provides the following SPI
     information:
        9.6.11.9.1. SPI number. Ten-alphanumeric positions followed by the RIC.             For
        example, SPI F003036728 FHZ.
110                                     AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


         9.6.11.9.2. Fast Pack SPI number. Ten alphanumeric positions. For example, the
         preservation and pack code (the third from last position) will always be an "X"
         preceded by the preservation code and five zeros: F000004XC1 (RIC).
         9.6.11.9.3. Standard pack SPI number. Ten alphanumeric positions. For example,
         the preservation code, simple instruction code, and container size code preceded by
         five zeros: F000004C01 (RIC).
  9.6.12. Requesting SPI Waiver Authority to Deviate. While the prime AFGLSC packaging
  office strives to minimize deviations, SPI waivers are sometimes necessary. This flexibility
  is required to accomplish mission objectives. Requests for SPI waiver authority to deviate
  are processed by the prime AFGLSC packaging office if no SPI is available to accomplish
  immediate mission support. A waiver authority number to deviate and applicable
  instructions will be provided. Mark the waiver number on the lower right hand portion of the
  identification side of the container(s) prior to movement and annotate same on the shipping
  document. Follow paragraph 9.6.12.1. information to provide when requesting SPI waiver.
      9.6.12.1. When requesting SPI waivers the following information shall be provided to
      the prime AFGLSC packaging specialist:
         9.6.12.1.1. TCN
         9.6.12.1.2. NSN

  9.6.13. Obtaining Assistance When No SPI Container Is        Available. If a SPI container
  cannot be fabricated at the base or a SPI container is not   available (e.g. new items, lost,
  damaged or destroyed containers and Credit Due-In From       Maintenance (DIFM)), take the
  following actions in order of precedence as listed below     in paragraphs 9.6.13.1 through
  9.6.13.4 :
      9.6.13.1. Scope RECON for SPI container availability and acquire the SPI container as a
      lateral support asset from bases within the same command or the same overseas theater.
      9.6.13.2. Request SPI waiver authority to deviate from the prime AFGLSC packaging
      office authorizing the use of a suitable replacement or alternate pack. Alternate packs
      may be authorized to meet shipping deadlines. Provide the prime AFGLSC packaging
      office with item and packing details for waiver applicability. A waiver authority number
      to deviate and applicable instructions will be provided.
      9.6.13.3. Purchase locally the services and/or materials to fabricate the required
      approved SPI container. Use AF Form 451 when fabricating SPI packs, as outlined in
      Attachment 5. Organizational flights/units requiring packaging services must complete an
      AF Form 451. Units requiring SPI container fabrication, construction, repair or
      packaging services beyond the capability of the base will provide an AF Form 406,
      Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement Document (MORD), AF Form 616, Fund Cite
      Authorization, DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR)
      and/or a Government Purchase Card account to cover the charges associated with the
      procurement of the packaging services. The UCMs are the only individuals authorized to
      sign AF Form 451.
      9.6.13.4. If the SPI container cannot be laterally supported or if there is no local
      packaging capability, then contact the prime AFGLSC packaging office above or TRC
      and request lateral support fabrication for the necessary SPI container(s). Use AF Form
      451 when requesting packaging services.
      9.6.13.5. For a long life or stock listed container, submit a requisition, through TO
      channels. Include the following information:
         9.6.13.5.1. SPI Number
         9.6.13.5.2. Quantity

           9.6.13.5.8. Squadron level authorizing signature
           9.6.13.5.9. Any other applicable information
       9.6.13.6. For items issued under the credit DIFM concept, where the reparable item is
       turned in to supply before the serviceable item is issued, the AF Form 451 must have
       "Credit DIFM – No Reusable Container Issued/Available." Supply will record on the
       shipping document "Credit DIFM - No Reusable Container Issued/Available." Delays
       can be avoided if maintenance units will ensure that the specified container is available.
       9.6.13.7. For SPI containers without stock numbers, contact the prime AFGLSC
       packaging office.
       9.6.13.8. For SPI containers that are Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS)
       managed, contact the applicable contractor source of supply for disposition instructions.
       9.6.13.9. The requesting activity is responsible for all materials and transportation costs
       for fabricated containers and/or the total contract cost associated with their fabrication.
9.7. Excess Reusable Containers for Redistribution. When an activity generates a local
excess over current or projected requirements, identify, segregate and inspect the condition of the
containers. Additional details are as follows:
   9.7.1. Excess Specialized Containers.
       9.7.1.1. Turn in those containers traced to a valid NSN to engine or munition accounts,
       as appropriate, for redistribution action. Redistribute containers that are separately
       accounted for only at the disposition of the IM.
       9.7.1.2. Attempt to cross-level trace to an NSN or SPI number any container not cross
       referenced to an NSN. You may request assistance from base TO, the prime AFGLSC
       packaging office or Container Design & Retrieval System (CDRS) office.
       9.7.1.3. TO may request assistance from the prime AFGLSC packaging office
       responsible for the SPI when redistributing specialized containers that have not been
       separately accounted for.
       9.7.1.4. Because these containers generally are in short supply and may be needed for
       packing other items on the SPI, the TO will identify these containers in CDRS and
       redistribute directly to other Air Force units needing them.
       9.7.1.5. Contact the IM and request instructions. If the IM does not need the containers
       for any purpose, contact the prime AFGLSC packaging office or 678 ARSS CDRS office
       to find a use for the containers. The prime AFGLSC packaging office or 678 ARSS
       CDRS office may have disposition instruction. The CDRS database is populated with
       most of the specialized/engineered FSC 8140 and 8145 shipping and storage containers
       from the FEDLOG system. If the containers are high quality containers with high value
       for future applications, the 678 ARSS CDRS office may request the containers be sent to
       their station for storage. The 678 ARSS CDRS office may look for storage options while
       looking for a using customer for the containers.
       9.7.1.6. Do not transfer specialized or multi-application long life containers to the
       DRMS unless directed in writing by the IM. As a last resort, after exhausting all
       available means (CDRS, MAJCOM disposition requests, lateral support) to redistribute
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                        113


     these containers to other Air Force units and written IM disposition instructions, then the
     containers can be turned-in to DRMS for recycling and/or resale.
     9.7.1.7. The requesting unit is responsible for all transportation (shipping and handling)
     costs associated with sending the reusable containers to a storage activity.
  9.7.2. Excess Long Life, Short Life and Multi-Application Containers (Non-Specialized).
  Use RECON to report excess serviceable non-specialized reusable containers (including
  containers for assets no longer on-hand) when the quantity or economic value justifies the
  cost of redistributing them. For unserviceable containers that are beyond economical repair,
  DRMS resell of non-usable excess for recycling is the preferred method of disposal.
     9.7.2.1. Redistribution of RECON containers may be funded by AF Working Capital
     Fund (AFWCF) or unit funds. To determine whether or not a container qualifies as
     AFWCF, access the Tracker system, Logistics Data Queries, and use the NIIN/TAC
     query. Refer to the AF cargo funding memorandums (see Chapter 7) for a table of
     AFWCF TACs to use (based on budget code). When using an AFWCF TAC, ensure the
     NSN is included on the shipping document, otherwise payment on the TAC will be
     denied. Some of the reusable containers maintained in SPIRES (FSC 8115, 8135, 8145
     and 9330 materiel) are non-AFWCF, and will reflect an alpha budget code or no budget
     code at all. These shall be funded by the unit‘s local O&M funds. For non-RECON
     supported disposition requests, the requesting activity is responsible for all transportation
     (shipping and handling) costs associated with container redistribution.
     9.7.2.2. Deliver SPI packs and wood containers to the storage site in a setup condition;
     deliver Tri-wall and fiberboard boxes knocked-down.
  9.7.3. Excess Consolidation Containers.
     9.7.3.1. Bundle excess used consolidation containers in serviceable condition and report
     them in RECON for disposition and/or lateral support. Return them to the nearest prime
     AFGLSC packaging office, Air Force unit, or other service activities with a valid need by
     opportune airlift or other low-cost transportation.
     9.7.3.2. Flatten disposal containers that are not recovered before they are placed in refuse
     receptacles or pickup sites.
  9.7.4. Excess Consumable Packs and Packing Materials.
     9.7.4.1. Recover and segregate by class and grade all excess reusable packs and packing
     materials (e.g. polyurethane foam cushioning) used to ship consumable items. Ensure
     personnel place packs and packing materials in designated recycling receptacles for re-
     use.
     9.7.4.2. Use RECON to report excess packing materials when the quantity or economic
     value justifies the cost of redistribution.
  9.7.5. Items Inside Recovered Containers.
     9.7.5.1. Be sure that containers are empty before you redistribute, recycle or dispose of
     them.
 114                                     AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


       9.7.5.2. Return items found in recovered containers to the accountable unit. If the item
       or unit cannot be identified from the container, turn-in the item to Materiel Management
       or Flight Service Center as Found On Base (FOB).
9.8. Selecting and Designing Specialized Long life Containers. These procedures shall be
followed when selecting and designing long life containers:
   9.8.1. The AFPTEF shall review and approve any specifications and statements of
   objectives/statements of work before you procure new long life container designs. Utilize
   the AFPTEF. Activities shall consider the in-house design, prototype, test and evaluation
   capabilities of the AFPTEF before soliciting/contracting such work out. Additional details
   are contained in Chapter 15 herein.
   9.8.2. Use the CDRS to determine if a design already exists to satisfy the mission support
   requirements. MIL-STD-2073-1 contains instructions on how to use CDRS.
       9.8.2.1. After selecting a standardized off-the-shelf container or approving a newly
       designed long life container, the buying activity must send the design data to: 678 ARSS
       CDRS Office, Building 615, Apalachicola Rd, , Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6845. DSN 875-
       3637, Commercial (850) 883-3637. Fax: 850-882-9381. Follow the procedures in MIL-
       STD-2073-1 for submitting new designs to CDRS.
   9.8.3. Contact the prime AFGLSC packaging office. Give preference to standardized off-
   the-shelf containers or standard designs that meet the long life performance requirement.
   9.8.4. If no standardized off-the-shelf container will satisfy the mission requirement, contact
   403 SCMS (AFPTEF) for guidance on the design, build and testing of new long life or
   specialized containers (non-munitions) or 678 ARSS CDRS Office for specialized munitions
   containers.
9.9. Container Standardization. To promote standardization, a series of standard size
containers are established for certain types of multi-application short life SPI packs (e.g. Fast
Packs and Standard Packs). Standardization reduces the cost of fiberboard shipping containers,
simplifies load planning, stacking, storage and reuse. Costs are reduced through central purchase
of large production runs.
   9.9.1. Adding New Multi-application Containers. 403 SCMS (AFPTEF) must approve
   recommendations for adding new multi-application containers to Air Force packaging
   systems before you develop or use them. 403 SCMS (AFPTEF) recommends approved
   multi-application containers with potential high use for inclusion in MIL-STD-2073-1.
9.10. Reusable Container Program Implementation Guidance.
   9.10.1. Program Roles and Responsibilities. At Installation/Wing/ALC/AFGLSC level, an
   effective reusable container program shall be established and implemented, maximizing
   recovery and reuse. This includes but is not limited to reimbursement and transfer of funds
   from host/tenant units for packaging services; lost, destroyed or discarded Fast Packs,
   standard packs, SPI shipping containers, packaging materials; labor hours for constructing or
   replacing SPI containers and commercial transportation (shipping and handling) costs. This
   gives the Wing and/or ALC/AFGLSC direct control over their program so they can adapt it
   to specific mission requirements. Following are responsibilities of the BCM and UCM:
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                     115


     9.10.1.1. The BCM or their designated representative shall ensure that all activities that
     receive, store, issue or ship government materiel:
        9.10.1.1.1. Implement procedures for control, recovery and re-use of reusable
        containers, packaging materials, reimbursement or prior transfer of funds for
        packaging costs.
        9.10.1.1.2. Ensure unit commanders appoint UCMs (primary and alternates) to
        establish and execute a viable, effective program. Units that utilize fewer than three
        (3) SPI containers, excluding Fast Packs, have the option not to have a flight/unit
        RCP at the discretion of the BCM.
        9.10.1.1.3. Ensure the using organizational flights and the TO recovers and re-uses
        prescribed active government owned short and long-life reusable containers and other
        specialized containers (FSC 8115, 8140 and 8145) that are accounted for by Materiel
        Management and engine accounts.
        9.10.1.1.4. Provide training and awareness to personnel assigned to non-
        transportation functions (e.g. maintenance, using organizational flights and other
        tenant units) on the concepts and procedures of the RCP.
        9.10.1.1.5. Receive and process AF Form 451, Request for Packaging Service, from
        using organizational flights when the proper SPI or Fast Pack container is required,
        but not provided. Using organizational flights will complete AF Form 451s, with
        UCM authorized signature, prior to item turn-in to LRS Materiel Management. AF
        Form 451 is also used for local fabrication requests of SPI containers.
        9.10.1.1.6. Process the AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement
        Document (MORD), AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, DD Form 448, Military
        Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR) and Government Purchase Card
        (formerly IMPAC) accounts for units requesting special packaging services to cover
        charges associated with repackaging of items (replacing lost or damaged containers),
        container repair and/or fabrication (materials and labor) and commercial shipping and
        handling.
        9.10.1.1.7. Maintain a list of UCMs authorized to sign AF Form 451. UCMs are the
        only personnel authorized to sign AF Form 451.
        9.10.1.1.8. Identify and establish procedures for recovery, re-use, transfer and
        reimbursement of funds under the reusable container program, including review of
        AF Forms 451, Standard Form (SF) 364, Report of Discrepancy (ROD), and requests
        for SPI packs and SPI waiver authority to deviate.
        9.10.1.1.9. Identify, track (monthly) and report (semi-annually) all costs and
        reimbursements on packaging supplies (EEIC 609) and labor (EEIC 39711) for fiscal
        purposes to the installation/wing commander, accounting and finance, organizational
        unit(s) incurring the costs, and upon request, appropriate MAJCOM.
        9.10.1.1.10. Ensure RCP compliance by performing semi-annual inspections of
        organizational flights/units reusable container storage areas.
     9.10.1.2. The UCM is the point of contact for packaging requirements and will:
116                                    AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


         9.10.1.2.1. Implement the RCP concepts and procedures herein.
         9.10.1.2.2. Manage the organization's RCP and associated storage area, ensuring
         compliance with this instruction, MAJCOM and local supplements.
         9.10.1.2.3. Coordinate with the BCM for assistance in resolving problems pertaining
         to the program.
         9.10.1.2.4. Contact the TO if SPI requirements cannot be met.
         9.10.1.2.5. Ensure sufficient storage space is available for reusable containers for
         items in their possession. Contact TO for disposition instructions after identifying
         excess serviceable reusable containers, if storage space is unavailable. Schedule turn-
         in of excess serviceable reusable containers to the TO for possible reuse.
         9.10.1.2.6. Approve and sign AF Forms 451 pertaining to packaging services and
         reusable containers. Ensure all items on the form are properly completed and that the
         AF Form 451 accompanies items for turn-in to LRS.
         9.10.1.2.7. Ensure serviceable items are removed from their assigned reusable
         containers and reparable items are placed in the same container for turn-in to Materiel
         Management or Flight Service Center. ESDS items need to be checked.
         9.10.1.2.8. Ensure serviceable and/or depot reparable spares are kept (stored) in their
         prescribed SPI packs until installed or required for bench check or inspection.
         Additionally, ensure these spares are provided proper protection in assigned SPI
         packs during shipment (including deployment, mobility and exercises).
      9.10.1.3. Program Implementation Procedures. The operating commands must set up
      procedures to develop and implement an effective RCP which will ensure maximum
      recovery and reuse of SPI containers. Program instructions implementing these
      procedures shall address the following:
         9.10.1.3.1. Identify procedures and responsibilities for receipt, storage, issue,
         recovery, turn-in, screening, reporting and recycling of reusable containers and
         packing materials. Ensure that reusable containers are separated from refuse (trash)
         and supply pickup sites.
         9.10.1.3.2. Identify procedures and responsibilities for recovering excess serviceable
         reusable containers and/or packaging material. Emphasize that reusable containers
         (non-specialized) and packaging materiel excess to the mission be listed on RECON
         for lateral support to other potential bases/units, where needed. Ensure effective
         methods and process for screening of reusable containers and packing material from
         recycling sites and waste streams (landfills, DRMS, etc.) are established. Reusable
         containers must not be needlessly discarded in waste receptacles or transferred to the
         DRMS unless directed in writing by the IM. If unable to re-distribute, then contact
         the prime IM for disposition.
         9.10.1.3.3. Implement training procedures and responsibilities for using
         organizational flights. Generally, training will be performed by the BCM. At a
         minimum, training will include: identification and safeguarding of reusable containers
         and associated packaging material, procedures and responsibilities for processing AF
         Forms 451 for packaging services to include reimbursement of funds, replacement for
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                     117


       wear and tear, lost, destroyed or discarded reusable containers. Include grading and
       marking standards of packaging materiel and lumber products used in CONUS and
       OCONUS. Familiarize personnel to regulations and standards associated with the
       packaging industry, both domestic and international. Emphasize requirements and
       mission support with packaging, handling, storing and movement of Air Force assets.
       9.10.1.3.4. Using Organizational Flights should ensure the issued item is not
       separated from its specified container. Transfer the item and the container at the
       same time. Flights requiring second-level repair, periodic bench check, build-up, etc.,
       must ensure that the specified container and item are promptly reunited. Upon receipt
       of the item from LRS Materiel Management Flight, ensure the required container is
       available. If the item is received without the required container, annotate on the issue
       document "No SPI container available.‖ AF Form 451 must be used for all items
       without the required SPI or Fast Pack before shipment turn-in to transportation. TO
       will maintain a copy of Unit Container Managers, primary and alternates, authorized
       to sign AF Form 451. Ensure that copies of SF 364 (ROD) and AF Form 451 are
       kept with the container if the item is in the wrong container. The BCM will forward
       all AF Form 451s with all costs of packing to the LRS Resource Adviser (RA). The
       LRS RA will forward to the unit RAs. Packaging services costs will be reimbursed to
       LRS Cargo Movement account.
       9.10.1.3.5. Organizational flights requiring packaging services will complete an AF
       Form 451. This form is supporting documentation for obligations made using AF
       Form 616 (or other instruments of payment) and can only be signed by the UCM. AF
       Form 451 will stay with the item during the turn-in cycle and will be administered by
       the TO packaging section. AF Form 451 will accompany all items turned-in to TO
       without prescribed SPI or Fast Pack containers. The AF Form 451 for ―container
       destroyed by user‖ or ―item issued without appropriate container‖ will be
       accompanied by a MIPR/MORD Number in the remarks section. Items in which the
       proper containers cannot be located, or incorrect containers accompany the items, will
       not be accepted for turn-in without this form. When processing AF Forms 451
       received from organizational units, annotate the necessary packaging materials and
       labor expenditures for direct packaging services payment accountability. All
       shipping and packaging materials costs incurred are subject to reimbursement or prior
       transfer of funds to procure packaging materials before shipment turn-in to
       transportation. When a unit brings an incorrect container and the SPI specifies a
       more expensive container, then either charge the unit for the use of the specified SPI
       container and give the incorrect container back to the unit, or charge the unit the
       difference between the specified SPI container and the incorrect container.
       Additional guidance in preparing AF Form 451 is found in Attachment 5.
       9.10.1.3.6. Establish a base reusable container working group, composed of
       journeyman-level representatives from Deployment and Distribution Flight,
       maintenance and other major using groups and resource advisors. This working
       group will be chaired by the installation RCP Manager. Further, this working group
       will meet annually (and as needed) to coordinate actions, analyze budgetary and
       operational requirements, evaluate number of containers lost or destroyed and
       replacement cost, indications of negligence in discarding reusable containers and
118                                    AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


         packing materials, number of excess reusable containers on-hand and status of
         disposition, address deficiencies and recommend corrective actions necessary for
         executing an effective and efficient base reusable container program.
         9.10.1.3.7. Establish UCMs to assist unit commanders by ensuring flights are
         responsible for identifying, storing, protecting, recovering and reusing containers
         identified herein.
         9.10.1.3.8. Identify procedures for evaluating deficiencies in the RCP. Establish
         procedures for performing corrective action and flight inspections. Review the AF
         Form 451, SF 364 and requests for SPI waiver authority to deviate.
         9.10.1.3.9. Identify goals and procedures for evaluating and measuring the
         effectiveness and efficiency of the RCP.
         9.10.1.3.10. Ensure organizational flights provide a covered, clean, dry space to
         protect reusable containers and packing materials from inclement weather during
         storage.
      9.10.1.4. Program Evaluation and Efficiency.
         9.10.1.4.1. The following goals are established to enhance the RCP: Improve
         training and awareness; Eliminate reusable container loss, unauthorized waste and
         destruction; Promote reusable container conservation.
         9.10.1.4.2. To measure program effectiveness and efficiency, BCMs will perform
         semi-annual inspections of organizational units reusable container storage areas.
         BCMs will prepare and utilize the semi-annual report. Report distribution will
         include installation, group and applicable unit commanders, primary UCMs, and upon
         request, appropriate MAJCOM. The semi-annual report will include the following
         elements:
             9.10.1.4.2.1. Unit Reusable Container Monitor Training.

                9.10.1.4.2.1.3. Total number of UCMs appointed.
                9.10.1.4.2.1.4. Percent of all UCMs trained.
             9.10.1.4.2.2. Reusable Container Return Efficiency.
                9.10.1.4.2.2.1. Number of AF Form 451s submitted in last six months and the
                associated total cost for supplies (EEIC 609) and labor (EEIC 39711) to
                provide/construct reusable containers.
                9.10.1.4.2.2.2. Number of AF Form 451s submitted due to loss/destruction of
                reusable containers (list unit responsible, item nomenclature and SPI number)
                and the associated cost to provide/construct reusable containers.
             9.10.1.4.2.3. Shipping Delays.
                9.10.1.4.2.3.1. The objective of measuring shipping delays is to elevate
                program awareness by how the loss/destruction of reusable containers can
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                   119


             impact the base mission.
             9.10.1.4.2.3.2. To measure, AF Form 451s will be annotated when the item is
             received and the date the item is packaged. The delay is the total days accrued
             between these dates.
          9.10.1.4.2.4. Reusable Container Storage and Conservation.
             9.10.1.4.2.4.1. Number of unit reusable container storage areas inspected the

              DISCREPANCY REPORTS AND TRACING PROCEDURES

10.1. Inspection. Inspect items systematically to prevent loss or damage from the time you
receive them until you use or dispose of them. Report defects to help the packaging designer
eliminate future damage.
10.2. Responsibilities of the Shipping Activity.
   10.2.1. The shipping activity must package materiel to prevent damage during shipment.
   10.2.2. Personnel performing packaging functions must             meet   minimum      training
   requirements or be supervised by fully trained personnel.
   10.2.3. When the shipping activity receives SF 364, Report of Discrepancy (ROD) or
   electronic Shipment Discrepancy Report (SDR) via WebSDR, they must notify responsible
   persons of deficiencies. They must train their personnel to correct deficiencies.
10.3. Damage Control in Receiving Activities. When you receive a shipment, check to:
   10.3.1. Determine if damage occurred during transit.
   10.3.2. Determine if the item is packaged according to the prescribed packaging
   requirements.
   10.3.3. Ensure adequate packaging is at the proper level to prevent corrosion or deterioration
   during storage.
10.4. Procedures for Stored Items. DOD Regulation 4145.19-1, Storage and Materials
Handling, includes procedures for inspecting stored items.
10.5. Damage to Issues. A major source of damage to delicate items is intra-base transfers.
Protect items that are subject to damage from shock and vibration during handling and
movement.
10.6. Discrepancy Reporting.
   10.6.1. Transportation Discrepancies. TOs process and report over, short, damaged, and
   astray cargo using the DD Form 361, Transportation Discrepancy Report (TDR), in
   compliance with DTR, Part II. Additional information may be found in 41 CFR, Parts 102-
   118, Public Contracts and Property Management. For FMS, refer to Paragraph 10.7. Air
   Force shipping activities are also required to report miscellaneous transportation
   discrepancies. Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 210, Paragraph H.1., and Appendix I.
   Particular attention will be directed to shipment discrepancies involving TPS and HAZMAT
   shipments.
       10.6.1.1. For any discrepancies with AA&E, classified, sensitive, classified/unclassified
       NWRM and items of $20,000 value, follow procedures in paragraph 5.11.2 and 5.11.2.1
   10.6.2. Packaging Discrepancies. When shipment damage, packaging deficiencies and
   container marking problems are noted, identify the discrepancy using an electronic Supply
   Discrepancy Report (SDR) via the DOD WebSDR system. Submit an online System Access
   Request (SAR) to DLA Transaction Services (DLATS) for requesting User IDs and
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                      121


  passwords        to        access       the        DOD        WebSDR          system       at
  https://transactionservices.dla.mil/daashome/homepage.asp. Air Force submitters shall
  use the exact identification of four-digit (e.g. P201) packaging discrepancy sub-codes in the
  DOD WebSDR system. In the absence of DOD WebSDR, use the SF 364. SF 364 can be
  used for reporting local purchase discrepancies to the Base Contracting Office (BCO).
     10.6.2.1. Requirements for Reporting Packaging Discrepancies.
         10.6.2.1.1. When to Complete SF 364. SF 364 will be completed if damage to the
         items occurs and the total cost to correct exceeds $100 per line item or if any of the
         following deficiencies exist, regardless of cost to correct:
         10.6.2.1.2. If the value of the item, shipment or package exceeds $2500.
         10.6.2.1.3. Repetitive deficiencies by a particular activity or repetitive damage found
         upon receipt.
         10.6.2.1.4. Any deficiencies in packaging involving ammunition, explosives, or other
         hazardous materials.
         10.6.2.1.5. Packaging deficiencies resulting in damaged material that may endanger
         life or impair combat or deployment operations.
     10.6.2.2. Compliance With Established Packaging Requirements. Unless items are
     damaged, SF 364 will not be issued against bases or ALCs under the following
     conditions:
         10.6.2.2.1. Items packaged before the current SPI date are acceptable and need not be
         repackaged before shipment.
         10.6.2.2.2. Contractor (with deviation number) or other service packages are
         acceptable for re-use as long as the container is a reusable, rather than one-trip,
         container. The prime AFGLSC packaging office must approve the use of a
         contractor pack by indicating the prime AFGLSC site and a deviation number in the
         lower right corner of the exterior container (for example, OC-001). When a
         contractor pack is used, annotate "contractor pack" on the DD Form 1348-1A or
         condition tag. Contractor packs may be recognized by the contractor data markings
         required by MIL-STD-129, such as purchase or delivery order and the name and
         address of the contractor.
         10.6.2.2.3. The prime AFLGSC packaging office has approved an alternate pack and
         has provided a waiver authority deviation number.
         10.6.2.2.4. Use of the next larger size Fast Pack container for shipments with
         Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS) priority 01-08 if
         the required Type I (Vertical) or Type II (Slide) is not available. SF 364 will be
         issued if damage occurs or if the next larger size Fast Pack is used for lower priority
         shipments.
         10.6.2.2.5. Use of larger size standard pack containers for shipment of unserviceable
         items when the correct size is unavailable.
 122                                      AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


   10.6.3. Control Points. AFJMAN 23-215, Reporting of Supply Discrepancies, establishes
   control points for distributing packaging discrepancy reports.  Ensure a copy of the
   packaging SDR is provided to the prime AFGLSC packaging office.
   10.6.4. SDR Responsibilities. Upon completion of WebSDR, Receiving personnel will
   provide Customer Service either a copy of the SF364 or an electronic notification that a
   discrepancy exists within WebSDR. Customer Service personnel will monitor, track and
   coordinate all SF364 actions until the discrepancy is closed.
10.7. FMS Discrepant Materiel. When FMS discrepant materiel is returned to the custody of
the U.S. Government, the materiel will be turned in on a Supply Discrepancy Report to the
nearest U.S. accountable military activity (regardless of military service responsible for the
materiel) and will be processed in accordance with U.S. procedures. Shipment documentation
retention will be for 2 years at the shipping site and retired to the appropriate Federal Records
Center for a period of 28 years. The shipment must be turned in on a DD Form 1348-1A
showing a proper TAC and DODAAC. No hazardous materials will be accepted without a
properly prepared Shipper‘s Declaration of Dangerous Goods. AFJMAN 23-215 is the authority
for this process. For additional information refer to DTR, Part II.
10.8. Suggestions for Improved Packaging. Identify approved or more economical packaging
methods, materials, and techniques by use of SF 364 reports. When submitting a suggestion
recommending an improved pack for a specific national stock number, attach a SF 364 along
with supporting photographs if possible that shows the packaging deficiency referenced and its
cause.
10.9. Tracer Action. Tracing shipments that have not been delivered to the destination by the
RDD is an important task. AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual details procedures for
processing and return of the Transportation Tracer Listing (TTL) and the Delinquent Shipment
Listing or R40. The TTL indicates delayed or lost shipments via government transportation
channels. LRS/APS Commanders will establish responsibilities within their squadrons for
completing tracing actions and for tracing shipments valued under $500. TOs will follow the
guidance           in           DTR             Part           II,          Chapter           210
(http://www.transcom.mil/j5/pt/dtrpart2/dtr_part_ii_210.pdf) when tracing efforts do not
locate shipment and a Transportation Discrepancy Report (DD Form 361) must be accomplished.
TOs will ensure an initial attempt is made to collect directly from carriers for lost (or damaged)
shipments valued at less than $500 dollars. If unable to adjudicate under these local procedures a
Transportation Discrepancy Report (DD Form 361) must be accomplished. Tracer action must
be accomplished for all protective and classified, protected or GSA shipments regardless of
dollar value. TOs can obtain shipment information by TCN, BOL or carrier‘s BOL through the
GTN at website: https://www.GTN.transcom.mil/index.jsp. Additional information can be
found by accessing the Tracker System at: https://tracker.wpafb.af.mil/.
   10.9.1. Inbound Receiving. The Logistics Readiness Squadron Commander is responsible
   for ensuring inbound shipments to their facilities are properly in-checked, inspected and
   receipted. LRS Commanders may provide LRS Management and Systems Flight Customer
   Service personnel limited access to the Inbound Module of CMOS to perform research on
   inbound astray or non-receipted shipments. They will provide a Transportation Tracer
   Listing (TTL) in original and one copy to the Cargo Movement Section twice each month.
   The TTL lists shipments requiring tracer action or receipt information in BOL or TCN
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                      123


   sequence. If information is incomplete, the Cargo Movement Section will annotate
   accordingly on the listing and return to the Customer Service Section for action. Provide the
   required annotations per AFMAN 23-110, volume 2, part 2, chapter 9 and return the listing to
   the LRS Management and Systems Flight Customer Service Section within 5 workdays of
   receipt.
       10.9.1.1. If an item is missing, LRS Management and Systems Flight Customer Service
       Section will process SF 364 (SDR) according to AFMAN 23-110.
       10.9.1.2. When the TO receives advance shipping notice or Report of Shipment, they
       will generate DD 361 to satisfy any over/short or damage condition.
   10.9.2. Outbound – Cargo Movement Section will trace originating outbound shipments
   using the R40 (original and one copy), which the Management and Systems Flight provides
   approximately every 2 weeks. The R40 requests the status of originating shipments
   supported by the base level supply system in requisition number sequence. Return the
   annotated R40 listing to the Management and Systems‘ document control activity within 5
   business days after receipt (see Para 10.13.).
10.10. AF GOCARE Program. GOCARE (Government Cargo Recovery Effort—formerly the
Astray Cargo Program) is a DOD program run by SDDC Strategic Business Directorate to direct
and guide the DOD in efforts to recover lost cargo found in CONUS commercial TSP
warehouses (Freight terminals, HHG warehouses and storage locations, other commercial
warehouses). The DTR, Part II, Chap 209 provides official guidance and DOD policy for
GOCARE. The SDDC GOCARE Guidelines published in the SDDC website provide
information             on             GOCARE               recovery               efforts:
http://www.sddc.army.mil/sddc/Content/Pub/5380/gocare%20guidelines%20update%20for%20t
he%20web.pdf Responsibility for the AF GOCARE program management has been delegated
from HAF/A4LM to AFGLSC, 401 SCMS/GUMAA. AF CONUS organizations will follow the
DTR, SDDC GOCARE guidelines and these instructions in implementing the program.
   10.10.1. AF Active, Reserve and ANG units with GOCARE committee members will
   establish a relationship with local commercial carriers and businesses to encourage
   communications in the recovery of lost and astray freight. AF committee members will
   ensure they visit carriers facilities in their area (coordinate visits when more than one DOD
   activities reside in one community or AOR--i.e. Active and ANG units co-located) at least
   quarterly.
   10.10.2. AF Committee members will report findings from their visits to local facilities in a
   quarterly report using the format at Figure 10.1 below. Email a copy of the completed report
   to your parent MAJCOM A4 GOCARE official by the 10 th business day of the month
   following the calendar quarter (reports due in Jan, Apr, Jul and Oct).
   10.10.3. MAJCOM A4 GOCARE officials will compile their command reports and send
   their consolidated reports to 401SCMS/GUMAA by the 15th of the month the reports are due
   to SDDC. 401SCMS will forward the AF report to SDDC and HAF/A4 by the 21st of the
   month the reports are due.
   10.10.4. GOCARE program requires reshipment of recovered astray freight received through
   causes other than the commercial carriers fault (requires SF361-DTR chap 210) to the proper
   destination. If available, quote the funds on the delivery documents to re-ship the recovered
            124                                                   AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


               material. If the fund cite is not available, contact the origin shipper. If only the National
               Stock Number (NSN) is available, coordinate with servicing base Materiel Management
               Section or IM for disposition. Errors in a fund cite on the origin shipping document must be
               corrected before onward movement. If available information and coordination will not
               provide a resolution, process through your servicing base Management and Systems Flight,
               Customer Service Section for disposition.
               10.10.5. If the carrier is at fault, ship on a ―Free Astray Basis.‖ This includes FMS
               shipments.
               10.10.6. To obtain disposition instructions for recovered astray FMS shipments (when loss is
               not responsibility of carrier) contact the origin shipping office. If assistance is needed,
               contact AFSAC/COSD, 5490 Pearson Road, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5332 (1-800-
               448-0361)

10.11. Tracing Process. TOs may use the tracing process to determine the status or location of
shipments that have been delayed, misplaced, or upgraded in priority. Do not initiate tracer
action until the Management and Systems Flight Customer Service Section provides positive
notification that the shipment has been released for movement to the consignee, and that normal
transit time has expired and undue delay has occurred. Initiate tracer action as follows:
   10.11.1. Shipments within CONUS:
       10.11.1.1. NMCS/MICAP, immediately upon request.
       10.11.1.2. Other TP-1 (Expedite), normally not prior to 2 days after shipped date.
       10.11.1.3. TP-2 (Expedite), not prior to 5 days after shipped date, and not later than 10
       days after shipped date.
       10.11.1.4. TP-3 (Routine), not prior to 10 days after shipped date, and not later than 20
       days after shipped date.
   10.11.2. Shipments to/from CONUS and overseas:
       10.11.2.1. 999/NMCS/MICAP, immediately upon request.
       10.11.2.2. Other TP-1 (Expedite), normally not prior to 4 days after shipped date.
       10.11.2.3. TP-2 (Expedite), not prior to 8 days after shipped date, and not later than 14
       days after shipped date.
       10.11.2.4. TP-3 (Routine), not prior to 30 days after shipped date, and not later than 70
       days after shipped date.
10.12. Transportation Tracer Listing (TTL). The Material Management Flight Customer
Service Section will check shipment status in Tracker before giving TTL listing to TO for action.
Mark each item on the list with one of the following statements. NOTE: If any other statement
is provided, Customer Service personnel may return the listing to TO for appropriate action.
   10.12.1. ―Received or in file (date).‖ This annotation indicates TO received the shipment on
   base and forwarded it to Logistics Readiness Squadron/Supply Activity for receiving action.
   10.12.2. ―TO tracing.‖ This annotation indicates TO has initiated tracer action. Trace the
   shipment through automated systems, the carrier, or with the consignor if known. Send
   tracer action requests to the IM when the consignor can't be identified.
   10.12.3. ―Updated shipment status.‖ This annotation indicates TO has received updated
   shipment status from the supplier. If Cargo Movement Section information differs with that
   shown on the TTL, circle the outdated transportation data and enter updated status.
   10.12.4. Attach a copy of the DD 361, Transportation Discrepancy Report (TDR), or tracing
   message, to the TTL and annotate "DD 361/Message attached." Preparation and distribution
   of DD 361 is made according to the DTR, Part II.
   10.12.5. If the majority of line items are repeats from the previous TTL, annotate
   "Previously Researched by the Cargo Movement Section,‖ and return the TTL to the
   Customer Service Section for action.
 126                                     AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


   10.12.6. The annotation "TM1 action required," requires the Customer Service Section to
   submit a request for transportation status on overseas follow-ups, through DAAS to the Air
   Force Shipper Service Control Office (SSCO), for tracing action.
   10.12.7. ―Return the Listing.‖ TO will return the annotated TTL to Stock Control within 5
   workdays of receipt. NOTE: TO may keep copy 2 if desired.
10.13. Delinquent Shipment Listing or R40 Procedures. TOs should compare entries against
the property shipped files. Annotate each entry after review. Return copies of documents with
the listing if they have not previously been provided to the Management and Systems‘ document
control activity.
   10.13.1. If the item has been shipped, enter the mode, TCN, date shipped, hold code, etc.
   Alternatively, simply attach a copy of the shipment planning worksheet.
   10.13.2. Enter Julian date shipment was made if confident of the date although unable to
   provide hold data or TCN/GBL.
   10.13.3. Enter "no record of receipt from the Management and Systems‘ document control
   activity" if there is no record of the item being received from the Management and Systems‘
   document control activity.
   10.13.4. Line out those entries for which movement data was previously submitted.
   10.13.5. Return completed R40 listing to the Management and Systems‘ document control
   activity within 5 business days after receipt.
10.14. Additional procedures for CMOS operating locations.
   10.14.1. Check the Volume of the MILSTRIP shipments manually in-checked (without pre-
   positioned data from the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) in file). Too many
   shipments, which have to be manually input, indicate a problem with the Interactive
   Communication Interface (ICI) or SBSS. Check with the Remote Processing Station (RPS)
   computer room supervisor and the LAN manager. Satellite accounts should contact their
   host SBSS for assistance. If all shipments to a specific off-base organization (usually
   document identifier ISU, MSI, or DOR) for a single organization code (X373AA12341234)
   or all shipments to DRMS are having to be manually in-checked (no advanced information
   from SBSS), have base supply ensure the off-base indicator is set correctly. Documents with
   identifier TRM have to be manually input.
   10.14.2. Check the accuracy of the MILSTRIP shipments manually in-checked, without pre-
   positioned data from the SBSS in file. Any variance (e.g. FB instead of FE, transposed digits,
   system designator 01 instead of A1, etc.) between the supply document number and the
   system designator on the document and the input to CMOS will cause the SSC message to
   fail at the SBSS and the correct TCN may appear on both Part 5 and Part 6 of the R40 report.
   Ensure MILSTRIP shipments manually in-checked (without pre-positioned data) are
   assigned "Doc Type" of "M" at the "Shipment Planning Detail" window. CMOS does not
   produce data for the SBSS for any other "Doc Type.‖
   10.14.3. Is the Management and Systems‘ document control activity researching and
   correcting the rejects (type 260) from SSCs returned to the SBSS with erroneous (non-
   matching) system designators or document numbers?
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                        127


   10.14.4. Check the inbound message log for messages with transmission mode of "ICI" and
   transmission status of "F" (failed). Review the associated priority message to determine the
   cause of the failure. Have these failures been reviewed with the local supply computer room
   personnel? Has the CMOS team at the SSG FAB (DSN 596-5771) been notified and/or has
   an SBSS discrepancy report been submitted?
   10.14.5. Release all shipments by close-of-business on the date shipped. Ensure every item
   in all consolidated shipments has been in-checked, linked to the lead TCN, and released in
   CMOS. The release action generates the communication messages for all CMOS interfaces,
   including the SBSS and is essential for ITV and accurate record keeping.
   10.14.6. Do items appear on the R40 even though the shipment was in-checked and/or
   shipped and released, prior to the date of the R40? If so, select three to five examples that
   were in-checked and/or shipped within the last 30 days. Ask the base supply Management
   and Systems‘ document control activity supervisor to ensure that the SBSS shipment
   suspense record for each example still does not contain the in-checked or shipment
   information. Check the outbound message log and select the corresponding ICI message and
   delete the Transmission Status field. This will cause the message to be resent to the SBSS.
   Coordinate with the Management and Systems‘ document control activity supervisor and
   obtain feedback as to when these messages (specific TCNs) are received and whether they
   loaded data correctly or rejected (failed). If they have not been received within a rea sonable
   time, check the transmission status field and ensure it had changed back to a "P" (processed).
   Then ensure all ICI connections are up and talking to each other. If the Transmission Status
   field changed to an "F" (failed), refer to Paragraph 10.14.8. below.
   10.14.7. Are the CMOS R40 monitor, the SBSS computer room supervisor, and the
   Management and Systems‘ document control activity supervisor working together to resolve
   problems?
   10.14.8. Are problems which are beyond local capabilities to fix elevated to the SSG Field
   Assistance Branch (DSN 596-5771) for resolution?
10.15. Tracing OCONUS DTS Shipments. Tracing can be accomplished through GTN,
Tracker, GATES, and other automated systems. For customers who do not have access to
automated means of tracing overseas shipments, contact the Air Force ACA/SSLO at Dover
AFB, DE, for east coast or Travis AFB CA for west coast by telephone, fax, or e-mail (see DTR,
Part II). The SSLO will trace shipment(s) by TCN and provide shipping status to the requesting
activity as follows:
   10.15.1. If no record is found, or if there is only a record of the ATCMD, the requester
   should go back to the originating point (shipper or supplier) for status.
   10.15.2. If there is a record of POE receipt, the SSLO will check with the POE Customer
   Service Branch for status and advise the requester.
   10.15.3. If there is a record of receipt and lift, the SSLO will advise the shipper.

           CLEARANCE OF AIR FORCE CARGO AND SHIPPER SERVICES

11.1. CONUS Distribution Management Cell (CDMC). The CDMC is the official clearance
agency for shipments planned for lift on military owned or controlled assets to overseas points. It
coordinates movement to the port of embarkation (POE) with both shippers and project
managers. The CDMC is responsible to maintain visibility over cleared cargo and provides
shipment status to tracer requests. In addition, the CDMC will work the POEs and shippers to
ensure advance movement data are at the ports prior to arrival of materiel. Elements within the
CDMC are the Air Force ACA and the Shipper Service Liaison Office (SSLO). The CDMC
provides a flexible process to locate, divert, expedite and/or provides visibility for any mission
critical cargo. The CDMC operates from a Command and Control Center at Wright-Patterson
AFB, OH, with additional personnel located within the CONUS aerial ports. A myriad of asset
visibility systems, commercial shippers, and overseas ports will be used to perform its mission.
The information gained will be used to meet the customer needs for their cargo delivery. The
data will also be used to focus on and alleviate systematic conditions slowing the movement of
cargo through the DTS and commercial transportation system. To request the services of the
CDMC         go      to    the     591      SCMG         website:    https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=-1749145. From the menu on the left, select Library
>> Policy >> Airlift Policy.
11.2. Theater Consolidation Shipping Point – Europe (TCSP-E). The TCSP-E is the single
theater focal point for timely management of sustainment cargo moving into theater and
transshipment of cargo to final predetermined destinations. The TCSP-E forecasts cargo arrival
through multiple Logistics Information Systems reports to make modal decisions prior to air
cargo arriving via AMC. Modal decisions take place at least 8 hours prior to cargo arrival,
providing an opportunity for TCSP-E to arrange both air and surface modes for onward
transportation to selected destinations within theater. Additionally, the TCSP-E provides a
flexible process to locate, divert, and expedite intra-theater cargo movement for selected
channels.
11.3. Air Force Eligibility and Challenge Procedures. The following Air Force airlift
eligibility and challenge procedures are effective 1 November 2004 and supersede previously
published version. Procedures for implementing current policy are specified in the following
paragraphs. For the most current information on airlift eligibility and challenge procedures, visit

   11.3.2. Airlift Eligibility. Only TP-1 shipments with a valid Required Delivery Date (RDD)
   to include a blank RDD and TP-2 shipments with a valid RDD as shown below are airlift
   eligible. TP-3 is not eligible for air movement and will be automatically diverted to surface.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                             129


   However, certain medical and short shelf life items may be authorized to move by air as TP-3
   only if they have a valid RDD and/or project code. The following table illustrates the
   relationship between the RDD and TP for airlift eligible shipments.

   11.3.3. Challenge Criteria.
       11.3.3.1. RDD 999. The Air Force ACAwill challenge the following commodities of AF
       sponsored shipments with RDD 999. These commodities typically would not meet
       NMCS/MICAP requirements in accordance with Ref A thru D policy/procedures. When
       shipments are offered as RDD 999 with the following commodities, the requisitioner or
       shipper will be notified that the shipment is being challenged. Commanders will
       approve, or delegate in writing to specific personnel the authority to approve, all
       NMCS/MICAP requisitions in writing. The requisitioner/shipper will then need to
       provide this written approval by the appropriate authority to support assignment of RDD
       999.
B - Construction Materials
D - Animals
E - Engineer Supplies
G - Printed Forms or Publications
J – Unaccompanied Baggage
K - Clothing or Fabrics
N - Ship Parts
Q - Plants, Plant Products, and Other Organisms
S - Office and School Supplies, Office Machines and Furniture
T - Household Goods
U - Mail
W- Any material not otherwise specified that may require
     special handling with special instructions identified in the
    DI T_9 trailer data. Primarily used with channel airlift 463L
     pallets.
Y - Personnel Services
Z – Human Remains

The requisitioner/shipper has the option to substantiate air transport at the time of initial request
to the ACA. The requisitioner/shipper should contact the ACA via email, fax, or phone with
 130                                       AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


their justification for use of air to prevent delay due to challenge procedures on urgently required
cargo. Shipments not justified to move as 999 will be downgraded. The ACA will determine
applicable priority and mode.
       11.3.3.2. If a shipment with any of the above commodities is released to the port as RDD
       999 prior to advance clearance, the shipper service liaison office at the port will have the
       shipment frustrated until the challenged process is completed.
       11.3.3.3. Air Force funded Second Destination Transportation (SDT)/Central Managed
       Account (CMA) (TAC = F_ _ _) shipments assigned a TP-1 with any RDD other than
       999 or TP-2 with any RDD will be challenged when the shipment exceeds 250 pounds or
       25 cube.
       11.3.3.4. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) funded (TAC = S_ _ _) shipments assigned a
       TP-1 with any RDD other than 999 or TP-2 with any RDD will be challenged when the
       shipment exceeds 500 pounds or 50 cube.
       11.3.3.5. TP-2 shipments with blank RDD are not eligible for airlift and will
       automatically be diverted to surface.
11.3.3.6. TP-3 shipments offered for airlift will automatically be diverted to surface movement,
with the exception of short expiration date items (see Paragraph 2.4.2.). However, TP-3
shipments may move as deferred air freight (TP-4) upon approval by Air Force ACA. Shipper
must receive clearance from ACA prior to shipping to the port.
       11.3.3.7. JCS Project Code Cargo (9_ _ ). JCS project coded cargo is subject to ACA
       challenge/hold action for purposes of controlling cargo flow in or out of the airlift system
       or to preclude misuse of project codes. Based on hold findings, the ACA will authorize
       (total or partial) airlift or can request shipment diversion to surface.
   11.3.4. Exemptions. TP-1 and TP-2 shipments with one of the characteristics listed below
   are all airlift eligible and exempt from challenge action and will continue to be cleared for
   airlift:
       11.3.4.1. Aircraft Engines.
       11.3.4.2. Foreign Military Sales (FMS): If the delivery term code (DTC), located at the
       fifth position of the TCN, is 6, 7, 9, A, D, F, G, or J.
       11.3.4.3. Shipments destined to FM5655 up to 1,500 pounds.
       11.3.4.4. Shipments with short expiration date (whole blood, perishable subsistence,
       biological, batteries, required refrigeration, radioactive, etc).
       11.3.4.5. AMC Support Shipments (TAC QMRS).
       11.3.4.6. TACs beginning with H, T and X
       11.3.4.7. Courier And Classified Shipments.
   11.3.5. Deferred Air Freight (TP-4). This allows non-air eligible cargo (TP-3 and excess
   weights/cubes) to move at surface rates in uncommitted aircraft capacity. Air terminal
   managers in coordination with the ACA will determine the actual amount of TP-4 accepted
   into the aerial ports. Cargo must be cleared through the ACA as TP-4 prior to movement.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                     131

                                         Chapter 12

                       TRANSPORTATION PAYMENT PROCESS

12.1. TPPS is the Commercial carrier payment process by which carriers are paid for services
directly by US Bank. It is managed for the Air Force by the Air Force Global Logistics Support
Center (AFGLSC). The Deputy Secretary of Defense has directed the use of TPPS for this
purpose and is applicable to AF Shippers, DOD Commercial carriers, brokers and AFGLSC,
Third Party Logistics providers.
12.2. TPPS Payment Process. The procedures outlined in the payment process must be
adhered to in order for the Certifying Officer (CO) to accurately certify the TPPS Summary
Invoice (PSI). The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) will reimburse the US
Bank for approved charges involved with shipping services based on obligations cited on the
PSI. The commercial carrier business rules contain the following functions in the payment
process.
   12.2.1. Shipment Booking. The shipping Transportation Officer (TO) or designated
   representative will enter shipment data into one of the following automated shipment data
   systems: The Cargo Movement Operating System (CMOS) or Global Freight Management
   (GFM)/Electronic Transportation Acquisition (ETA). If CMOS/GFM-ETA is unavailable, a
   shipper invoice ―Buyer Document‖ must be created manually and the data entered directly
   into TPPS at https://www.TPPS.com/USBank If a carrier‘s software or waybill is used to
   create the movement document, the PRO or Tracking Number assigned by the carrier will be
   input into TPPS and used as the Buyer Document Identification Number. For assistance with
   the creation of a shipper invoice, contact the TPPS help desk or AFGLSC 401
   SCMS/GUMAB.
       12.2.1.1. When a site initially sets up a TPPS account, the automated shipping system to
       be used must be identified. This will ensure that the proper ―sort code‖ is assigned.
       GFM/ETA utilizes the Government Bill of Lading Office Code (GBLOC) and CMOS
       uses the Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC).
       12.2.1.2. Carriers are identified to TPPS by their unique Standard Carrier Alpha Code
       (SCAC) Shipping offices will ONLY utilize the official SCAC for a carrier. A List of
       approved SCACs for all TPPS participating carriers is available on the TPPS web site,
       Business Partners, Certified Seller List.
       12.2.1.3. TOs shall not accept a shipment without a valid TAC, MORD/MIPR number/or
       SDN. The appropriation chargeable will be entered with the shipment details into
       CMOS, GFM/ETA, or TPPS. If manually inputting a buyer invoice into TPPS, shippers
       must ensure that the Chart of Accounts (COA) reflects the proper funding reference for
       the shipment.
       12.2.1.4. When utilizing CMOS, System Administrators must ensure that the Site
       Specific Data screen, Bill To field is populated with USBANK to identify the use of
       TPPS. The MRM 15 indicator must also be checked for each carrier SCAC loaded into
       the Surface Freight Outbound, Commercial Carrier Data screen.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                       133


  12.2.2. Documentation. Two copies of the Commercial Bill of Lading (CBL) are printed at
  a minimum, one is given to the carrier representative at the time of pick-up and the other is
  retained for TO cargo movement file in accordance with DOD FMR requirements..
  Additional copies may be produced if required
     12.2.2.1. The Movement Documents will be released immediately following pickup or
     within prescribed timeframes to obtain proper ITV. This will release the electronic CBL
     data to TPPS. If shipping via I2P Express Ship, check for breaks in the Pickup Record
     Number. A break signifies a file was not released out of CMOS successfully. If there is
     a break in sequence, immediately contact the Field Assistance Branch (FAB) at DSN
     596-5771.
  12.2.3. Status/Price Confirmation Generation. The carrier will submit delivery status to
  TPPS via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 214 transaction set, the TPPS web interface or
  by telephone. If the carrier submits price data to TPPS, it will be via EDI 110/210 transaction
  sets. The carrier will perform services according to the shipping instructions as specified in
  the CBL and applicable contracts and tenders. The carrier must provide notification of
  delivery of the shipment to TPPS before the payment can be made. Cargo Movement
  Sections will track all CBLs issued, and follow up with carriers on shipments that do not
  have a notice of delivery IAW contracted timeframes..
     12.2.3.1. If the shipment incurs additional charges for services or other accessorial
     charges, the carrier will bill the origin TO by creating a linked eBill in TPPS. Carriers
     will create linked eBills for any charges not included in the original billing transaction.
     The linked eBill will cause the CBL to appear in audit exception in TPPS. The
     destination TO shall notify the origin TO of any additional charges associated with the
     CBL. If the charges are to be paid by destination, the destination TO must provide an
     LOA/SDN to the origin TO; procedures for a MIPR or an AF 616 apply. The origin TO
     will input the applicable LOA and approve the linked eBill for payment. Anytime a
     linked eBill is created, the ―notes‖ feature of TPPS must be annotated with the rationale
     for eBill payment. Unlinked eBills are prohibited in TPPS per DOD Memorandum dated
     April 2, 2008.
  12.2.4. Accounting Classification Review. At any time during the billing cycle, the
  ‖Transportation of Things‖ program manager (can be designated as the Funds Manager (FM)
  for that account) and the Accounting Liaison Office will coordinate and review the Statement
  Preview or Expense Distribution in TPPS to confirm the proper use of the applicable LOA.
  If a change in the LOA is required, the FM will coordinate with the TPPS POC in the
  Distribution and Deployment Flight. Any errors or changes referred to the TO will be
  corrected and documented in the TPPS note function. All changes must be handled
  promptly, and should not exceed three Government Business Days (GBDs).
     12.2.4.1. Tracker Lite is the ―mid stream‖ funds check that occurs after the shipment has
     been released from CMOS, but before the shipment has been posted into TPPS. As the
     authoritative source of Air Force funding policy, Tracker Lite prevents unauthorized use
     of CMA funds. If Tracker Lite determines that funding cited by the shipper is
     inappropriate, Tracker Lite will either assign the correct funding or will designate the
     shipment as funded by the shipping unit. Shipping sites are encouraged to obtain Tracker
134                                     AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


      Lite access to determine appropriate funding during the planning process, view funding
      changes after shipment release, and verify the status of transactions passing to TPPS.
  12.2.5. Carrier Payment Approval Requirements. TOs will assign each individual TPPS
  user a maximum dollar amount for carrier payment approval. Primary and alternate TPPS
  approvers are designated for various thresholds in the event the shipment exceeds a single
  user‘s maximum approval limit. When a transaction exceeds all local approval levels,
  contact AFGLSC 401 SCMS/GUMAB for assistance. The approval level can be temporarily
  increased, on behalf of the shipper if the request is submitted prior to posting of the
  transaction in TPPS. If the request is submitted after transaction submission a GUMAB
  representative will make the approval on behalf of the shipper. These actions must also be
  annotated within the notes feature for that transaction. For audit processes, the TO should
  verify delivery status by contacting the destination TO. If discrepancies are discovered, both
  origin and destination TOs should notify the carrier for resolution.
      12.2.5.1. The shipping TO will approve payment for the amount determined to be the
      government‘s responsibility to pay. The amount to be paid includes the rate for the
      shipment and any authorized accessorial charges as specified in the contract.
      12.2.5.2. Payment by US Bank cannot be made until there is confirmation in TPPS that
      services have been performed. The confirmation of performed services will be the
      receipt of the carrier‘s notification of delivery. Actual carrier payment will be based on
      services annotated on the CBL. The approving official will launch the TPPS Transaction
      Manager function daily, review transaction status, cancel and approve or place on hold all
      shipments with a delivery notification. The notes function must be used to substantiate
      placing a transaction in ―hold‖ or ―cancel‖ status so the carrier is notified and can take
      action if necessary.
      12.2.5.3. In the government and carrier data models, maximum automatic approval price
      thresholds have been established in TPPS. TOs may request a change to the price
      threshold based upon workload and carrier characteristics. Requests will be routed
      through MAJCOM for approval before submission to AFGLSC 401 SCMS/GUMAB.
         12.2.5.3.1. Shipments meeting the automatic approval price threshold and tolerance
         parameters will be approved for payment without an on-line review by the TO.
      12.2.5.4. Any transactions that are not automatically approved must be approved
      manually. Whenever possible, a separation of duties should be maintained and the
      person who approves carrier payment should be different from the person who initiated
      the movement document. Shipments that do not meet the auto approval criteria, must be
      addressed within three GBDs after notification of delivery and one of the following
      actions must be performed: (1) Approve the payment, (2) Place on hold, and request
      additional information from carrier, and cite in a TPPS note, (3) Cancel the transaction
      and record reason in a TPPS note.
      12.2.5.5. The TO must approve for payment, the amount determined to be the
      government‘s responsibility to pay. Differences between this price and the originally
      tendered estimate (if higher) will be resolved in a linked eBill. Adjustments in the
      original payment estimate must be documented in the TPPS note function for the purpose
      of invoice certification and audit.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                       135


         12.2.5.5.1. Once a response from a carrier is received on a shipment placed in hold,
         the TO that placed the hold has three GBDs to approve or deny.
     12.2.5.6. The TO can update a transaction in TPPS before US Bank remits payment to
     the carrier. The TO approving the change must attach a note to the transaction in TPPS
     explaining the change. All changes affecting price must be recorded in TPPS either
     directly in the form as a note, or as an update from the shipper system.
         12.2.5.6.1. If a shipment is delivered after the Required Delivery Date (RDD), and
         the price paid is contingent on timely delivery, the TO will adjust the price in TPPS
         prior to approval and record the rationale in a TPPS note. The price adjustment will
         be determined by the terms of the contract or tender. If payment for a late shipment
         was automatically approved, the TO will submit an eBill to request an appropriate
         adjustment in price accompanied by a note detailing the reason for the reimbursement
         request.
     12.2.5.7. After US Bank has paid the carrier, any changes to price or shipment data must
     be entered into TPPS via the linked eBill process and annotated in the transaction notes.
  12.2.6. Carrier Payment. US Bank will not pay the carrier until notification of delivery
  and TO approval is received. US Bank will pay the carrier after the TO approves the
  transaction for payment, removes a transaction from hold status or resolves an eBill. The
  carrier payment approval process (referenced in paragraph 12.1.5.) outlines the action the TO
  will use to approve transactions.
  12.2.7. Accounting. Individuals responsible for LOAs, MORDs, and MIPRs will manually
  adjust or post obligations utilizing the information available in TPPS (Once the process
  becomes fully automated, TPPS will send obligations and accruals direct to DFAS).
  12.2.8. TPPS Summary Invoice (PSI). Procedures for the Prompt Payment Act apply. The
  responsibilities for certifying officers, accountable officials, and reviewing officials are
  contained in DOD 7000.14, DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoDFMR), Volume 5,
  Chapter 33, Accountable Officials and Certifying Officers (see Paragraph 3307 for
  information regarding pecuniary liability):
  http://www.defenselink.mil/comptroller/fmr/05/05_33.pdf
  The LRS/APS commander is the designated appointing authority for the Certifying Official.
  The appointment must be in writing and a copy of the appointment letter, along with the DD
  Form 577, Signature Card, must be on file with the DFAS Indianapolis Disbursing Office.
  Supervisors will ensure all appointed COs and AOs complete initial and annual refresher

  validating user access and authorization levels to improve separation of duty issues for the
  TPPS billing system.
     12.2.8.1. The Certifying Officer will utilize the open summary invoice preview to
     research PSI entries prior to the availability of the PSI no less than two TBDs prior to the
     statement cycle date to identify any transaction discrepancies. Any discrepancies must be
     immediately reported to the TPPS Customer Operations Desk for investigation and

      resolution. The Funds Manager report can be accessed daily to review shipments that
      have been paid in TPPS.
      12.2.8.2. PSIs from US Bank are normally available to the Certifying Officers two days
      after the 15th of the month. The CO is to retrieve statements when made available by the
      bank. The CO will date stamp the date received on the PSI when retrieved. If the PSI is
      not available two days after the 15 th, the CO will stamp the PSI with the date the PSI
      became available. The PSI must be accessed through the TPPS website and printed out.
      No hard copy will be mailed to the Certifying Officer. The Certifying Officer will review
      the PSI from US Bank to ensure that it reflects the actual carrier payments.
         12.2.8.2.1. Electronic Statement Certification. The certifying official will review and
         approve payment by acknowledging the following statement: ―As a Certifying
         Officer, I hereby certify that this Summary Invoice represents the amount due U.S.
         Bank for payment services rendered during the billing period ending (mmm/dd/yyyy).
         I further certify that the amounts shown as being expensed to each expense account
         are accurate and correct. This certification applies to each transaction contained
         within the Summary Invoice, jointly and severally‖. Upon electronic certification,
         DFAS will reimburse the bank as indicated on the invoice.
         12.2.8.2.2. Manual Statement Certification. The CO will date stamp the date
         received on the PSI when retrieved. If PSI is not available two days after the 15th, the
         CO will stamp the PSI with the date the PSI became available. The PSI must be
         accessed through the TPPS website and printed out. No hard copy will be mailed to
         the Certifying Officer. The Certifying Officer will review the PSI from US Bank to
         ensure that it reflects the actual carrier payments. The Certifying Officer must certify
         the PSI and forward it, along with the Line Level Detail for the same period to the
         designated DFAS payment center.
      12.2.8.3. Statements requiring both electronic and manual certification will process
      transactions IAW 12.2.8.2 for each invoicing type.
      12.2.8.4. The Certifying Officer must certify the PSI and forward it, along with the Line
      Level Detail for the same period to the designated DFAS payment center by the third
      calendar day following the date the PSI is available. This is to ensure the DFAS
      payment center has sufficient time to validate and make payment to US Bank to meet
      Prompt Payment Act requirements.
      12.2.8.5. Accounts will be suspended if delinquent greater than 105 days. Upon
      suspension, US Bank will not pay any additional payments to carriers until the
      delinquency is resolved. Even if the shipper approves payment to the carrier, the
      payment will not be generated and will remain in an ―approval final‖ status versus going
      to a ―payment initiated‖ status. In addition, delinquent accounts generate interest charges
      to US Bank which are funded by the shipping base O&M accounts.
  12.2.9. Bank Payment. The US Bank‘s PSI charges will be summarized by TAC and
  associated LOA. The PSI will not include SDN level of detail. The Line Level Detail will
  provide the SDN level detail. Additional supporting detail is available in TPPS via multiple
  reporting tools.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                         137


       12.2.9.1. If the DFAS payment office receives a certified PSI with a LOA that fails edit
       in the entitlement system because of insufficient funds available, DFAS will increase the
       obligation to the billed value. If the LOA fails the edit because no funds are available,
       DFAS will either establish an obligation, or will debit the service‘s alternate LOA. If the
       LOA fails the edit because of validity, DFAS will attempt to identify the correct LOA by
       contacting the originating TO. The originating TO will have two GBDs to provide a
       corrected LOA. If unsuccessful, DFAS will assign the service‘s alternate LOA for billed
       value and notify the HQ POC for the alternate LOA. The DFAS payment office will
       notify the HQ POC of any obligation increase, the establishment of any obligation, or the
       use of the alternate LOA. DFAS will then process the payment to US Bank.
   12.2.10. Dispute Resolution. The following guidelines will be used for the creation of
   linked eBills to resolve disputes:
       12.2.10.1. The carrier has the option to go through the appropriate Surface Deployment
       and Distribution Command (SDDC) office to request a price adjustment. However, a
       billing dispute must first go through the eBill process before requesting a price
       adjustment from SDDC.
       12.2.10.2. Either the TO or the carrier can submit a linked eBill. After the linked eBill is
       submitted to TPPS, the other party will have three GBDs after receipt to reply. After
       receiving a linked eBill from the carrier the TO will either: approve payment, cancel
       payment, or hold payment. The notes function will be used to document any action
       necessary to resolve the transaction in a ―hold‖ or ―canceled‖ status.
       12.2.10.3. If the TO issues a credit to the carrier in a linked eBill the carrier must
       respond within three GBDs by approval, cancel or hold on the credit.
       12.2.10.4. Price disputes that cannot be resolved between the TO and the carrier after 60
       days will be forwarded to SDDC.
12.3. Local Certification Process (LCP). LCP is the process where TPPS enabled sites have
the ability to utilize WCF and SDT/CMA TACs for shipments who meet funding criteria set
forth in the funding guidelines. These shipments along with all others are locally approved and
certified by the shipper site and reconciled on their local PSI. AFGLSC 401 SCMS/GUMAB
will only process transactions for those sites which cannot be LCP enabled. This is limited to
sites in the AOR. (Reference Paragraph 12.1.4 for guidelines on researching valid AFWCF and
Specific SDT/CMS TACs authorized by TPB).
12.4. Third Party Billing (TPB). This procedure applies to authorized TPB certified carriers as
directed by HQ USAF/A4LM. TOs must use TPB only if not LCP enabled and when the
shipment is funded with an AFWCF or specific SDT/CMA TAC.                          AFGLSC 401
SCMS/GUMAB has provided detailed TPB and TAC information in the funding memorandums
and       on        the       591        SCMG          website:      https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=-1749145. From the menu on the left, select
Library >> Policy >> Transportation. Under TPB, TPPS is the commercial carrier payment
process allowing US Bank to pay the carrier upon notice of delivery. In turn, US Bank is
reimbursed by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) after the TO certifies the
TPPS Summary Invoice (PSI). This commercial payment process is applicable to carriers,
brokers, and third party logistics providers. Refer to Paragraph 12.1. for TPPS procedures.
 138                                     AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


   12.4.1. All valid AFWCF and SDT/CMA TACs are authorized in TPB. Updates will be
   provided by message. The DAASC Master TAC Reference Table has been replaced by the
   Transportation Global Edit Table (TGET). AF TACs are input through the TGET system.
   The web URL is https://beis.csd.disa.mil/beis-html/frontpage-pki.html. User ID and
   password are required for access. For assistance with TGET, contact the support desk, e-
   mail BEISOPERATIONSSUPPORT@DFAS.MIL. The TGET system is the authoritative
   source for all TAC information.
12.5. The GPC may be used to pay for DESPS BPA. Cardholders must coordinate with their
TO prior to setting up an account. The TO will provide advice to cardholders when requested. If
the purchase card is used without first setting up an account, units will be billed at the higher
commercial rate. (Reference: AFI 64-117, Air Force Government Wide Purchase Card (GPC)
Program).
   12.5.1. Contractor Reference Guide. TOs must ensure they obtain a copy of the DESPS
   carrier(s) reference guide that provides added guidance. The DoD Domestic Express Small
   Package Service website is: https://private.amc.af.mil/A4/domexpress/spsindex.html.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                       139


                                            Chapter 13

                                 CONTRACTOR SUPPORT

13.1. Transportation and Traffic Management Guidance. Transportation and Traffic
Management guidance pertaining to contract support is in numerous DOD, Joint Service, Air
Force instructions, manuals, and civilian agency directives. TOs provide transportation and
deployment and distribution support/training to contracting offices as contained in these
publications, to include cargo movement support to government contractors, when designated.
The most used publications are listed below:
   13.1.1. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Particularly Parts 8, 12, 13, 42, 47, and 52.
   13.1.2. DOD FAR Supplement.
   13.1.3. Air Force FAR Supplement.
   13.1.4. Title 49, CFR, Transportation.
   13.1.5. ICAO/IATA
13.1.6. IMDG
   13.1.7. DOD 4500.9-R, DTR, Part II.
   13.1.8. MIL-STD-129 and MIL-STD-2073-1
   13.1.9. AFI 32-7086
   13.1.10. AFI 64-117
   13.1.11. AFMAN 16-101, International Affairs and Security Assistance Management.
   13.1.12. AFMAN 24-204_IP
13.2. Deployment and Distribution Support. TOs provide advice to the contracting officer to
include appropriate deployment and distribution and logistics contract language. They also
evaluate prospective contractor offers to assist the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) in
obtaining the most economical and responsive transportation service for the Air Force customer.
It is essential that liaison is established between the two offices to produce the best possible
contractual instrument, clearly defining packaging and transportation mode/method,
documentation and payment.
13.3. Assistance to Contracting. The transportation advisor to contracting must exercise
judgment and technical skill in providing advice that will result in transportation terms in the
contract or purchase order that are most advantageous to the government.
   13.3.1. Depot-level Reparable Shipments. For AFWCF depot-level reparable shipments,
   door-to-door commercial express carrier movement should be contracted/arranged with the
   contractor source as part of the process. This supports Agile Logistics principles.
   13.3.2. Air Force contracts with private contractors (vendors), must include in statements of
   work the requirement to transmit electronically shipping information in formats capable of
   interfacing with DOD data systems (see 13.4.4.3).
 140                                      AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


   13.3.3. Specific contract language will vary depending on the delivery terms stated in the
   contract, e.g., where government ownership occurs (―Free on Board [FOB]‖).
       13.3.3.1. Early government ownership begins at FOB origin, Consolidation
       Containerization Point (CCP) or Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE) and drives the
       transportation clauses in the contract to mirror DOD shipments and requires specific
       DTR documentation and MILSTD labeling and markings.
       13.3.3.2. Pure direct vendor delivery (DVD) contracts (FOB destination, prepay and
       GPC) have no actual commercial need for military standards-based documentation and
       marking. However, it is necessary to establish a minimum set of requirements for these
       shipments in order to: 1) ensure proper processing at destination Supply Support Activity
       (SSA), 2) integrate DVD shipments directed into the Defense Transportation System
       (DTS) in the event of crisis or contingency, or 3) generally support DOD ITV
       requirements. Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 201. See 13.4.4.
       13.3.3.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) 49th Contracting Squadron (49 CONS) will
       coordinate with the TO during the bid process for all commodity type contracts requiring
       shipment from point-of-sale to point-of-use Free on Board (FOB) Origin/Other. (See
       AFI 24-203, Chap 13 for specific guidance).
       13.3.3.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) 49 CONS will provide FOB terms, commodity
       description/shipping characteristics, and origin information to the TO.
       13.3.3.5. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) The TO will evaluate vendor shipping methods
       to determine best value practices and advise 49 CONS on recommended transport terms.
       13.3.3.6. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) 49 CONS                    will   assign    contract   clause
       information based on the recommendation of the TO.
       13.3.3.7. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Both 49 CONS and the TO will establish general
       procedures and thresholds to streamline the purchasing process and eliminate
       unnecessary actions.
13.4. Assistance to Contracting and GPC holders. The Contracting Officer will establish the
best possible contractual instrument, clearly defining training requirements (i.e. Contracting (AF
Form 9) and Government Purchase Card (GPC)). Incorporate packaging and transportation
mode/method/documentation and payment in this training based on the advice of a transportation
advisor. This transportation advisor to contracting must exercise sound judgment and possess
technical skill in providing advice that will result in transportation that is most advantageous to
the government. All transportation costs (including, but not limited to, commercial, AMC, MSC
and SDDC), for items purchased on O&M funds using an AF Form 9 or micropurchases using
the GPC are the responsibility of the ordering unit. The cost of transportation should be included
as part of the contract/purchase price. Use of USPS and small package carriers via the door -to-
door delivery method from the vendor to the ultimate commercial address of the customer are the
preferred mode/method for shipping. OCONUS shipments must comply with all packaging,
marking, and documentation/advanced clearance and destination host nation custom clearance
requirements required by the DTR, Part II. See Chapter 7 for guidance in establishing funding.
See        the        AF        Knowledge          Now         Cargo          Movement        CoP,
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-LG-TR-A1, for sample
procedure letters, Contracting/GPC card holder worksheets, vendor shipping instructions, and
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                      141


TCN/TAC rosters. Below are the shipping options available to assist TOs in providing sound
advice to their installation Contracting Officer:
   13.4.1. First, except as directed to acquire supplies in the order of priority established in
   FAR 8.002, Priorities for Use of Government Supply Sources, cardholders should consider
   transportation costs in the total acquisition cost of supplies. Items purchased locally may
   result in significant cost avoidance when compared to purchasing from CONUS sources
   when shipping costs are considered. Overseas bases should check for in-theater GSA stores,
   such as in Hawaii, Alaska, and Kaiserslautern, Germany.
   13.4.2. Second, of the items that must be purchased within the CONUS, determine if the
   cargo is small enough for shipment with the United States Postal Service (USPS), the most
   economical mode of shipment.
      13.4.2.1. Ship packages prepaid parcel post to your unit‘s official APO mailing address.
      The maximum USPS weight and size limits are 70 pounds/108 inches in length and girth
      combined for Priority (7-10 day transit time) and 70 pounds/130 inches length and girth
      for Parcel Post (10-20 day transit time). Return receipt (certified or registered) is
      recommended for traceability purposes.
   13.4.3. Third, the customer may choose to ship via a small package carrier via Free on Board
   (FOB) Destination terms to the ultimate commercial overseas address. Contractor Prepaid
   Shipping Instructions: funding these shipments should be all inclusive in the contract
   verbiage or must be paid with the GPC. The MAJCOM/base financing procurement of assets
   with O&M funds on an FOB Origin basis must fund the transportation with its O&M-type
   funds.
      13.4.3.1. Shipments of prepaid shipments that are within size and weight limitations of a
      small package carrier must move by the least costly carrier based on misson
      requirements. Any direct charge for prepaid cost will be listed as a separate item on the
      invoice for the supplies shipped. Submit a copy of the transportation or freight bill with
      the invoice for cost verification. Failure to provide a copy of the paid freight bill may
      result in the contractor not being fully reimbursed for freight charges. Contractors shall
      not divide quantities into small parcels to avoid shipment by other modes of
      transportation (FAR 42.1401-1(a)).          Contractors shall not insure shipments at
      Government expense for the purpose of recovery in case of loss or damage, except where
      minimum insurance is required for the purpose of obtaining receipts at point of origin and
      upon delivery (FAR 42.1404-1(d)).
   13.4.4. Fourth, if the shipment must move using AMC, MSC or SDDC services, the ordering
   unit‘s base TO will assist cardholders by providing information on customs clearance,
   packaging, marking and DTR, Part II, documentation/advance clearance requirements for the
   vendor to follow. Special Clauses under the FAR Part 12 are required to be used when
   shipment is to be performed through other than commercial transportation, such as the DTS.
   Do not make shipments without contacting the TO.
   13.4.4.1. For any cargo moving through the DTS, a TAC is required to pay for
   transportation charges such as port handling and transoceanic movement. (see 7.3.4.1). The
   TAC is required on the Contracting/GPC Transportation Support Worksheets, reference para
   13.4. Some installations have base wide TACs established which must be revalidated every
142                                      AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


  fiscal year through AFGLSC. If the installation or your group/unit has a TAC established the
  TAC owner must approve its use by signing the worksheets.
      13.4.4.2. Shipments NOT within size and weight limitations: Provide all applicable
      information on the transportation support to contracting and GPC card holder worksheets
      to the distribution section at your installation. Unit must also fund for the cargo to be
      shipped to the port of entry. Unit is responsible to ship the cargo prepaid by surface and
      add the costs as separate billing item to the invoice to the CCP or port for entry into the
      DTS. Annotate the bill of lading "Transportation under this tender is for the U.S.
      Department of Defense and the actual total transportation charges paid to the carrier(s) by
      the consignor or consignee are assignable to and are to be reimbursed by the
      Government." Also, describe the freight on the bill of lading using the Harmonized Code
      https://www.webflis.dlis.dla.mil/WEBFLIS/ to determine the most descriptive
      nomenclature based on, NSN, part number, and other data presented by supply activity
      or vendor. Provide a copy of the paid freight bill with the invoice. Failure to properly
      annotate the bill of lading, failure to use low-cost carrier provided or approved by the TO,
      and failure to provide a copy of the paid freight bill may result in the contractor not being
      fully reimbursed for freight charges. NOTE: Outsized cargo: Contact TO at least 5
      workdays prior to movement on less-than-truckload quantities (under 10,000 pounds) and
      14 days prior to shipment on truckload quantities (10,000 pounds or more). Upon
      request, contractors must submit a DD Form 1659, Application for U.S. Government
      Shipping Documentation/Instructions to the cognizant TO.
      13.4.4.3. Once worksheets are received by your installation distribution section, they will
      process the documentation and provide: the Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document
      (DD Form 1149), Military Shipping Label (DD Form 1387), Transportation Control and
      Movement Document (DD Form 1384), vendors instructions, and will assist the unit in
      clearance of cargo through the DTS ports of entry. The unit/shipper is required to then
      send all the documentation to the vendor by any means possible (e.g. Facsimile, scan and
      e-mail or postal). Once the vendors receive the documentation they must follow the
      instructions for packaging, marking and labeling. NOTE: Shipments destined for an
      AMC terminal (e.g. McGuire or Travis) require that Air Force contracts with private
      contractors (vendors) include in statements of work, the requirement to transmit shipping
      information electronically in formats capable of interfacing with DOD data systems.
      The on-line logistics tool at https://lsotools.wpafb.af.mil/atcmd managed by the Air
      Clearance Authority (ACA) will allow vendors to transmit the Advanced Transportation
      Control and Movement Document (DD Form 1384) for clearance of the cargo. Units
      must plan their contracting/GPC purchases accordingly. These procedures are required to
      ensure property is identified correctly and delivered to the customer without delay.
      13.4.4.4. Packaging, Marking and Labeling. Guidance for requirements for uniform
      military marking for shipment and storage is found in MIL-STD-129. Guidance for
      determining the applicability of commercial or military packaging is found in MIL-STD-
      2073-1.
  13.4.5. NOTE: IAW AFI 32-7086, GPC card holders are required to receive approval from
  the Hazardous Materials Pharmacy before the unit purchases the hazardous material. Once
  approved the vendor is responsible for completion of the Shipper Certification to the port of
  entry in addition to the international transportation mode (e.g. a shipping paper, 49 CFR as
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                       143


   well as a hazardous declaration or Multi-modal declaration (AFMAN 24-204_IP,
   IATA/ICAO or IMDG)). Federal and military regulations require the shipper to certify that
   hazardous materials are properly identified, described, packaged, marked, labeled, and in
   proper condition for transportation. Depending on the mode/method or whether the shipment
   moves by commercial or by military transportation, the specific language may vary and
   specific forms may be prescribed. At no time will classified, sensitive, explosive, or any
   NWRM items be purchased with the GPC.
13.5. NWRM Movement Reporting Requirement for Performance Work Statement
(PWS). Organizations developing requirements documents for the shipment of NWRM shall
include the following paragraphs in all performance work statements or statements of work.
   13.5.1. Outbound Shipments.
       13.5.1.1. Report of Shipment (RESHIP). The contractor shall send a REPSHIP to the
       destination transportation officer IAW FAR 52.247-68 and the Defense Transportation
       Regulation (DTR) Part II, Chapter 204. For NWRM, the contractor shall complete the
       following additional actions: (1) Confirm consignee receipt of REPSHIP; (2) Record the
       date/time and name of consignee POC when confirmation is complete and maintain with
       the consignor copy of shipping papers; and, (3) Confirm consignee receipt of shipment
       (by telephone call or carrier delivery transaction) and maintain the confirmation with the
       consignor copy of shipping papers.
13.5.1.2. NWRM E-mail. Within two hours (CONUS) and eight hours (OCONUS) of shipment
departure, the contractor shall send an e-mail to the origin and destination NWRMAO/MASO
organizational email account, consignee receiving, the IM and 735 SCMG or AFSPC/LSC as
appropriate. The e-mail will contain the movement document number and transportation control
numbers (TCNs) of the shipment. E-mail addresses can be found in SharePoint at
HTTPS://cs.eis.af.mil/afmunitions/nmc2/nwrm. The contractor shall request a SharePoint
account by contacting the ESD at DSN 945-2900 or via email at lackland.esd@us.af.mil. Access

                                            SAFETY

17.1. Operational Risk Management (ORM). Where situations exist that do not appear to be
adequately covered by this instruction, commanders and deployment planners at all levels will
use ORM to assess risk associated with those situations and determine adequate safeguards or
procedures to manage the risk. ORM guidance, definitions, techniques, and tools are found in
AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Management and AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk Management
(ORM) Guidelines and Tools.
17.2. Hazards. All managers and supervisors must incorporate Operational Risk Management
(ORM) within the workplace. Identify, eliminate or control, and document hazards to minimize
risk associated with uncertainty in the decision-making process. Managers and supervisors at all
levels must recognize the sources of hazards and apply appropriate safety practices to avoid
injuries to personnel and damage to equipment by following Wing established procedures and
directives, asking for help when needed, and using the appropriate personnel protective
equipment (PPE) IAW AFOSH-STD-91-501, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety
Standard.
17.3. Hazard Abatement Program. Implement and follow the Air Force Hazard Abatement
Program to protect all Air Force personnel from work-related deaths, injuries, and occupational
illnesses. Under this program, personnel identify potential hazards within the work environment.
After hazards have been identified, determine the adequacy of current directives and procedures,
provide appropriate training to affected personnel, and provide a method to track and control the
training and hazard correction/abatement processes. See Attachment 1 for appropriate AFOSH
standards, TOs, and other applicable directives. Document safety plans, actions, hazards, and
personnel training with the appropriate AF forms listed below.
   17.3.1. AF Form 3, Hazard Abatement Plan; AFI 91-301, USAF Occupational and
   Environmental Safety, Fire Protection and Health (AFOSH)Program.

17.4. Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. Implement and follow the Air Force Mishap
Prevention Program to protect Air Force resources. All Air Force personnel have the
responsibility under the mishap prevention program to identify workplace hazards, to include
equipment and environmental situations that places Air Force personnel, equipment, or facilities
at risk. After hazards have been identified, assess the risks associated with each hazard,
determine and take action(s) needed to reduce the risk by: engineering the hazard out; or
imposing procedural actions (operational limits, frequent inspections, protective equipment, or
stopping until corrective action is taken); and/or educating and training personnel on the hazards
and the safety procedures to be followed to reduce the chances of a mishap occurring. See
Attachment 1 for appropriate AF instructions, AFOSH standards, TOs, and other applicable
directives. Ensure all personnel receive safety, fire protection, and health on-the job training
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                        155


upon initial assignment and whenever there is a change in equipment, procedures, processes or
safety, fire protection, and health requirements. Well-trained and educated personnel are the
greatest deterrent to mishaps in the workplace. Supervisor‘s document safety-related training on
AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, or other form/automated system approved by
the Chief, Ground Safety, IAW AFI 91-301.
17.5. Safety Inspections. Accomplish hazard assessment and identification through the
application of occupational safety, fire prevention, and health inspections, evaluations, and
surveys. Supervisors perform self-inspections to assess the safety environment of the unit. Most
AFOSH standards contain sample checklists for unit self-inspections. Also, use locally
developed checklists tailored to specific unit requirements. Wing or base-level safety,
bioenvironmental engineering, fire protection, and environmental inspectors conduct unit
inspections, evaluations, and surveys according to AFI 91-301 and AFI 32-7086, Hazardous
Materials Management.
   17.5.1. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) officials, as representatives
   of the Secretary of Labor may conduct inspections of nonmilitary-unique workplaces and
   operations where Air Force civilian personnel work. (The inspections may be unannounced).
   OSHA inspectors may question or privately interview any employee, supervisory employee,
   or official in charge of an operation or workplace.
   17.5.2. Federal OSHA officials may perform OSH inspections of Air Force workplaces in
   areas where the US holds exclusive federal jurisdiction (including government owned
   contractor operated facilities).
   17.5.3. State OSHA officials, operating under a federally approved plan and subject to the
   terms of any variance, tolerance, or exemption granted by the Department of Labor, may
   enforce state OSHA standards in contractor workplaces. At overseas locations, local
   government agencies may conduct inspections of contractor facilities or operations as
   stipulated in the status of forces or country-to-country agreement IAW AFI 91-301.
17.6. General Safety Guidance. Packaging and preservation personnel are exposed to a large
variety of hazardous situations, machinery, equipment, and chemicals. Most hazardous
situations can be avoided by simply following procedures, asking for help when needed, and
using personal protective equipment (PPE). Supervisors must be knowledgeable of the AFOSH
Standards, TOs, and AF instructions applicable to their operations and ensure their personnel are
educated on the safety requirements applicable to the job. Personnel work more safely and
effectively when properly trained and motivated. For example, ensure personnel who work with
hazardous chemical are trained as outlined in AFOSH-STD-91-501 on personal protective
equipment.
   17.6.1. Use the general work center safety guidance in AFOSH-STD 91-66, General
   Industrial Operations, and local instructions. Follow AFOSH-STD-91-66 for safe practices
   in operation and maintenance of base facilities, such as, buildings and grounds, general
   housekeeping, ladders, office safety practices, emergency eyewash and showers, and finger
   ring policies. It also addresses safety precautions for electrical facilities and electronic
   equipment, such as, electrical emergency equipment, protective equipment, fire prevention,
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), first aid training, clothing and jewelry. It also contains
   guidance for tool safety, material handling, fall protection, housekeeping, and operation and
   maintenance of compressed air systems.
 156                                      AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


17.7. Work Safety Guidance. Follow safety guidance found in AFOSH-STD-91-66 and
equipment TOs. AFOSH-STD-91-66 contains safety guidance for general housekeeping and
office safety principles. See Attachment 1 for AFOSH standards applicable to packaging and
preservation activities.
   17.7.1. Adhere to AFOSH-STD-91-501 for requirements on safe operation, inspection and
   maintenance of industrial machinery. Packaging and preservation personnel must inspect
   equipment prior to use. Supervisors are required to instruct machine operators on the proper
   use, inspection, maintenance and documentation requirements. Industrial machines will be
   scheduled for preventive maintenance (inspection and minor maintenance) on a weekly basis,
   the AFTO Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment Record, will be used to document
   inspection and maintenance action requirements and accomplishments. Documentation will
   be accomplished using T.O. 34-1-3, Machinery and Shop Equipment.
17.8. Flight Line Driving. Motor vehicles operating on the flight line present a clear and
possible danger to aircraft, equipment, and ground personnel. Guard against carelessness, haste,
and disregard of safety standards. These factors are the primary sources of collisions and
personnel injury. All operators of vehicles on the flightline must first obtain training and possess
a valid flightline driving permit. Follow the general safety requirements for flight line vehicle
operations found in AFOSH-STD 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line Ground Operations and
Activities and AFJMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Driver, AFI 13-213, Airfield
Management and Base Operations, and local instructions. Familiarize all personnel authorized
to operate vehicles on the flight line with the aircraft marshaling signals found in AFI 11-218,
Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground.
17.9. Warehouse Entry/Exit. Driving in and out of warehouses, the basic rule is to blow horn
upon entering and exiting building. A spotter will be used if the operator‘s vision is obscured by
the load. Refer to AFOSH 91-46, Material Handling and Storage Equipment.
17.10. AFOSH Guidance. Use AFOSH standards where federal standards either do not exist,
do not adequately cover a function, contain less stringent criteria, or when consolidation of
information is beneficial for use in the workplace. Use Air Force functional directives and
technical data in conjunction with AFOSH standards. If conflicting guidance exists, the weapon
system specific technical data will take precedence. See Attachment 1 for AFOSH standards
applicable to packaging and preservation activities.
17.11. Hazardous Energy Control (Lockout and Tagout). Use of procedures to isolate
machinery or equipment (in off-equipment areas) from all potentially hazardous energy shall be
implemented IAW AFOSH-STD 91-501. When the unexpected energizing, startup, or release of
stored energy could cause injury, machinery or equipment is locked out or tagged out before
qualified personnel perform any servicing or maintenance. Instruct all personnel in the safety
significance of lockout or tagout procedures. Additional guidance for instituting an effective
program for Hazardous Energy Control (Lockout and Tagout) and Mishap Prevention Signs and
Tags is found in AFOSH-STD 91-501, Chapter 21.
17.12. Safety Equipment. Hazards should be engineered out, isolated, guarded against or a
safer chemical used as a substitute whenever possible before considering the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE). PPE devices alone should not be relied on to provide protection
against hazards, but should be used in conjunction with guards, engineering or administrative
controls. When PPE is required, ensure personnel are provided the appropriate PPE for the
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                       157


hazard and are trained in its use, inspection and care. Contact the installation ground safety or
bioenvironmental engineering staff for assistance in the selection of PPE. Review AFOSH-STD-
91-501 for additional information on personal protective equipment.

                     IN TRANSIT VISIBILTY (ITV) REQUIREMENTS

18.1. Introduction. Successful ITV is cargo and/or passenger data received by GTN and links
data directly to airlift mission numbers and/or surface transportation mode; truck, train, or ocean
vessel. GTN is the designated DOD system for ITV, providing C2 that integrates automated
information support to the DOD. The Air Force goal is 100 percent ITV. ITV is a process
consisting of designated business procedures to provide accurate source data, prompt nodal
updates, shipment status information, and shipment receipt notices. ITV employs various AIS,
uses appropriate AIT, and adheres to acceptable standards. The Air Force will realize reliable
ITV when accurate source data is flowed through CMOS or, at AMC aerial ports, GATES to
GTN, and that flow to GTN meets DOD ITV timeliness criteria. CMOS and GATES feed data to
GTN and GTN collects and displays the data to generate ITV.
18.2. ITV Process.
   18.2.1. Units initiating movement requirements are responsible for accurately providing all
   information to establish ITV. Units must prepare accurate automated air manifests using
   CMOS or, at AMC aerial ports, GATES. This is also applicable to Operational Support
   Airlift (OSA) aircraft under control of the Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC).
   Movements are not considered complete until ITV has been achieved.
   18.2.2. ITV must be maintained at transload location when deploying forces and cargo are
   transloaded from one aircraft to another at an en route location or intermediate stagin base
   (ISB) for onward movement to final destination. NOTE: This process is also applicable to
   surface to air/air to surface movements.
18.3. Bar Coding Requirements. Transportation activities will use bar coded DD Form 1348-1
and Military Shipment Labels to facilitate cargo receipt and processing. Bar coding on the 1348-
1A can be used to receive cargo from supply and to build consolidated shipments. If pre-
positioned data has not been provided from SBSS, the bar coded information can be used to
initiate creation of an inbound record. At in-transit points, 2-D TCMD data can be used to
populate missing data in WPS, GATES or CMOS. To support reading/writing bar-coded labels,
transportation activities will:
   18.3.1. Maintain the capability to produce and read bar coded 1348-1As and MSLs.
   18.3.2. Maintain sufficient bar code capable printers to support MSL production. Attach
   labels IAW MIL-STD-129.
   18.3.3. Maintain hand held terminal and/or wedge readers to support in-check processes.
18.4. Active RFID Requirements. Transportation activities will use Active RFID to support
COCOM visibility requirements as set forth in DTR, Part II, Chapter 208.
   18.4.1. Unit move shipments. Active RFID tags will be affixed to unit move pallets,
   containers, and major end items (e.g., rolling stock, engines, pods, propellers) moving
   to/from OCONUS locations or moving in CONUS in support of NORTHCOM deployments.
   To support reading/writing active RFID, transportation activities will:
       18.4.1.1. Tags will be affixed IAW MIL-STD 129.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                          159


       18.4.1.2. Tagging will be limited to a single tag per cargo increment.
       18.4.1.3. Origin will always tag deploying vehicles and major end items. Origin will tag
       463L air pallets built locally. If cargo is sent to an AMC port for aggregation, origin will
       provide transportation control and movement data to port, but will not tag cargo.
18.4.1.4. Ensure active RFID docking stations and/or write cables are registered with PM-JAIT.
The CMOS RFID registration guide can be found on at
https://www.gunter.af.mil/il/ilr/ilrc/documents.aspx. Note that if a docking station and/or write
cable is moved (between outbound freight and the DCDF, for example) it must be re-registered.
       18.4.1.5. Budget for maintenance and replacement of RFID hardware.
       18.4.1.6. Deployment and Distribution Flights will order and maintain sufficient tags to
       support local exercise requirements as determined by the Installation Deployment Officer
       (IDO). Tags will be ordered through base supply. The current tag is stock listed as
       "Model 654 with 128 KB RAM, NSN 6350-01-523-1998". However, units should
       validate the current tag model/NSN with their MAJCOMs prior to ordering.
       18.4.1.7. Installations will order tags to support unit deployments from the central
       repository maintained by AF AIT PMO using the following procedures.
           18.4.1.7.1. Determine total tag requirement for deployment.
           18.4.1.7.2. Order tags no earlier than 45 calendar days prior to the projected
           deployment date.      Request tags from Mr Ramirez, 403 SCMS/GUEA,
           peter.ramirez@wpafb.af.mil, DSN 787-7297.
           18.4.1.7.3. Account for RFID tags during deployment planning and execution.
           18.4.1.7.4. Ensure adequate time is built into the deployment schedule of events to
           allow tags to be properly affixed to deploying cargo at the cargo deployment function.
           18.4.1.7.5. Establish local procedures to receive, store, and maintain tags received at
           origin.
       18.4.1.8. At deployed locations - establish local procedures to recover, store, and
       maintain tags in working order at deployed locations. If tags in excess of deployed
       location unit move requirements are collected, request disposition instructions from Mr
       Ramirez, 403 SCMS/GUEA, peter.ramirez@wpafb.af.mil, DSN 787-7297.
       18.4.1.9. At deployed locations - apply tags to deploying/redeploying cargo.
       18.4.1.10. Collect tags upon redeployment to home station and request disposition
       instructions from Mr Ramirez, 403 SCMS/GUEA, peter.ramirez@wpafb.af.mil, DSN
       787-7297.
   18.4.2. Sustainment shipments. Transportation activities will tag all originating 463L pallet
   loads, containers and major end items shipped to, from and between overseas locations. To
   support reading/writing active RFID, transportation activities will:
       18.4.2.1. Tags will be affixed IAW MIL-STD 129.
       18.4.2.2. Tags will be applied at the highest level of consolidation done at the installation
       level (e.g., if you place a major end item in a container, only tag the container).
 160                                       AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


       18.4.2.3. If cargo is sent to an in transit point for aggregation or containerization, origin
       will provide transportation control and movement data, but will not tag cargo.
       18.4.2.4. Ensure active RFID docking stations and/or write cables are registered with
       PM-JAIT.       The CMOS RFID registration guide can be found on at
       https://www.gunter.af.mil/il/ilr/ilrc/documents.aspx. Note that if a docking station
       and/or write cable is moved (between outbound freight and the DCDF, for example) it
       must be re-registered.
           18.4.2.4.1. Budget for and order tags and batteries to meet sustainment requirements
           and maintain a stock of active RFID tags for meeting tagging requirements. See
           paragraph 18.4.1.6 for tag ordering process. On-hand requirements will be established
           locally, but should be no less than 3-months average volume.
           18.4.2.4.2. Budget for maintenance and replacement of RFID hardware.
       18.4.2.5. Assure tags are turned off while in storage and batteries/tags are operational
       prior to use.
       18.4.2.6. Establish procedures to receive, store, and maintain tags received at origin.
       18.4.2.7. Establish procedures for recovery and reutilization of active RFID.
18.5. I TV Verification. Designated personnel will query GTN no later than one (1) hour after
aircraft departure to ensure the presence of cargo and/or passenger data. At a minimum, verify
the mission number (to include the Julian date) and the three-digit MILAIR Aerial Port Code
(APC). If data is not present at the prescribed time, is incorrect, or if assistance is needed after
trouble shooting locally to ensure the communications and transactions were transmitted, the
representative will contact the GTN Help Desk. The GTN Help Desk can be contacted at DSN:
576-6836, commercial (618) 256-6836, by fax at DSN 576-6600, commercial (618) 256-6600,
via USTRANSCOM Help Desk toll-free at 1 (877) 906-0246 (request transfer to the GTN Help
Desk), or by email ustc-gtnhelpdesk@ustranscom.mil.
18.6. Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) Contract Language.
   18.6.1. The DOD Transportation Acquisition Policy Memorandum of 2003 requires that
   vendors adhere to standard documentation and marking IAW MIL-STD-129, DOD Standard
   Practice Military Marking for Shipment and Storage, to include but not limited to Military
   Shipping Label and bar-coding requirements, and provide ITV at the time the shipment is
   initiated.
   18.6.2. The DOD Transportation Acquisition Policy Memorandum of 1998 requires that
   tenders and contracts with transportation providers (carriers) include instructions to transmit
   and capture shipping information via Electronic Commerce (EC)/Electronic Data Interchange
   (EDI) to DOD (See Chapter 13 for further guidance).
18.7. ITV Metrics. On behalf of HQ AF/A4LM, 402 SCMS/GUSB will collect, analyze and
report ITV data accuracy and timeliness on Air Force sponsored cargo.
   18.7.1. Metrics criteria for analysis includes, but is not limited to: the transportation activity,
   system availability, data input – accuracy, completeness, usability; reporting timeliness, user
   training, ATCMD, bar coding – present, readable; data available in, GTN– system
   availability, drillable data, timely receipt of data transmissions, etc.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                       161


   18.7.2. Though JOPES data remains at level IV, to accomplish their goal, the Air Force
   requires level VI detail. Level VI is detail expressed for passengers by name and SSAN or
   for coalition forces and civilians by country national identification number, and for cargo by
   Transportation Control Number (TCN). Non-Unit cargo includes FSN/NSN or item detail.
   18.7.3. For airlift ITV – Source data comes from CMOS and GATES, and which feed GTN
   providing ITV on Channel/Contingency/SAAM missions. For remote locations or locations
   without CMOS or GATES capability the sponsoring command/higher headquarters must
   identify the shortfall to USTRANSCOM and request assistance. (See paragraph 18.8.2.6.).
   18.7.4. DOD ITV POC is USTRANSCOM ITV Cell, DSN 779-2552, email: USTC-
   ITVTrackingCell-Lst@hq.transcom.mil
18.8. Contingency/Unit Move Deployment and Redeployment.

Figure 18.1. Deployment In Transit Visibility.




   18.8.1. UDMs/IDOs at origin Air Force locations will assure complete accuracy of and
   provide all necessary documentation and data to enable ITV requirements of unit movement
   cargo upon deployment execution as follows:
      18.8.1.1. At origin/POE. Prepare commercial movement documentation as required
      using CMOS. If cargo is moving through the DTS and is destined for a POE, assure
      Advanced Transportation Control and Movement Document (ATCMD) data is submitted
      to support receipt and onward movement. Prepare automated air manifests using CMOS.
      This is also applicable when using Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft under
      control of the Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC). Movements are not
      considered complete until ITV has been achieved.
          18.8.1.1.1. Sealift requirements and ITV, refer to DTR Part II and Part III.
      18.8.1.2. At destination/POD. Receipt for cargo. Prepare documentation for onward
      movement as required by mode. Prepare commercial movement documentation using
      CMOS. Prepare air or truck manifests using CMOS or GATES at AMC strategic aerial
      ports. Movements are not considered complete until ITV has been achieved.
 162                                     AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


       18.8.1.3. At final destination. Receipt for cargo using CMOS. Movements are not
       considered complete until ITV has been achieved.
       18.8.1.4. The basic principles of personnel and cargo deployment and documentation
       apply to both Air Force and non-Air Force movement requirements. Non-Air Force units
       moving using Air Force systems (CMOS/GATES/TCAIMS II, or new generation system)
       will provide unit deployment data for cargo and passengers from TC-ACCIS, TC-AIMS
       II, MDSS II, or an importable Excel spreadsheet, as required in the DTR, Part III,
       Mobility.
NOTE: Air Force passengers and cargo moving as part of, or imbedded within another
service movement, will be manifested and processed by that Service. Service AIS, policy,
and reporting will be followed for ITV capture and input into GTN.
       18.8.1.5. Accurate manifesting at origin/POE will enable en route locations to
       electronically re-manifest. Manifests must accurately reflect cargo/passenger content
       prior to aircraft departure.
       18.8.1.6. Deploying Air Force units will follow cargo and passenger processing guidance
       in AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution. Also see DTR, Part III, Mobility.
   18.8.2. Deployment Requirements.
       18.8.2.1. A fictitiously entered ULN will prevent cross-referencing this data back to the
       TPFDD. The supported combatant commander then begins losing visibility of forces
       moving forward. CMOS will pass movement data, with valid ULNs, to GTN . NOTE:
       Do not use fictitious ULNs to deploy personnel in advance of an actual deployment
       order. Air Force automated systems that comprise the IDS must be used to support the
       deployment process and enable ITV.
       18.8.2.2. Use of IDS is mandatory for all wing-level deployments, regardless of size,
       scope, real world, exercise or unit moves. The IDS is designed to automate the
       deployment process and eliminate manual data entry through use of standard electronic
       interfaces between IDS components. (See Chapter 19 for system descriptions)
       18.8.2.3. Deployment files from LOGMOD/LSA and MANPER-B will be passed to
       CMOS/GATES to achieve ITV. CMOS/GATES will pass the movement data to GTN.
       18.8.2.4. Execution Cargo Procedures:
       18.8.2.5. Units tailor their tasked UTC cargo data in LOGMOD/LSA. Once completed,
       wing-level LOGMOD/LSA operators export the consolidated electronic cargo data (via
       .CL5 export file) and pass it to aircraft load planners to produce pre-load plan.‖.
       LOGMOD/LSA operators export this data (via .CMC file) to CMOS/GATES operators at
       the CDF to preposition cargo data in CMOS/GATES prior to cargo in-check.
NOTE: In advance of cargo in-check, LOGMOD/LSA operators need to quickly populate
AALPS/CMOS/GATES to facilitate efficient cargo flow. At in-check, the cargo is matched
against the data prepositioned in CMOS/GATES and manifested. NOTE: If changes are made
in CMOS/GATES, UDMs/IDOs will notify LOGMOD/LSA personnel of these changes by
the most expedient communication method PHONCON, email, exportable data file, etc.
CMOS/GATES pushes electronic deployment data transactions to GTN to enable ITV.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                       163


     18.8.2.6. Either CMOS or GATES will be used to generate the electronic cargo manifest.
     ―If CMOS/GATES is not available to produce the manifest, a DD Form 1385, Cargo
     Manifest, will be used. These locations will request assistance from USTRANSCOM
     through their supporting major command/higher headquarters. USTRANSCOM will then
     identify the ITV shortfall to AMC/TACC. AMC/618 TACC will then source and task the
     appropriate ITV resources, either with personnel and equipment moved to the location or
     by providing an E-mail ITV enabler utilizing the AMC ITV Cell.‖ It is imperative that
     UDMs ensure all of the required TCMD data (e.g., transportation trailer data for
     hazardous material, sensitive, classified, etc) is accurate and loaded in LOGMOD/LSA.
     The UDM may require the assistance of a transportation specialist to ensure TCMD data
     meets DTR requirements.
     18.8.2.7. En route locations with CMOS/GATES capability will ensure manifests reflect
     any cargo load changes prior to aircraft departure. This updated data will be sent
     electronically to onward destination(s) when originated from CMOS or GATES
     locations. When DD Form 1385 is used the manifest will be adjusted accordingly. En
     route locations without CMOS/GATES will be identified to USTRANSCOM by
     supporting major commands/higher headquarters.
     18.8.2.8. APODs and terminating points with CMOS/GATES capability will receipt
     cargo and ensure it is manifested for onward transportation to final destination (this
     includes transloading). Terminating points without CMOS/GATES capability receipt
     cargo will be identified to USTRANSCOM by supporting major command/higher
     headquarters.
     18.8.2.9. Execution Personnel/ Passenger Procedures:
     18.8.2.10. The PDF exports personnel data (via .PRF file) and tasked manpower
     requirements data (via .LVY file) from MANPER-B and provides the data file to the
     IDO/wing LOGMOD Administrator for upload into LOGMOD/LSA. Squadrons use
     LOGMOD/LSA to electronically assign personnel to the tasked requirements. NOTE:
     Assigned personnel must be resident in LOGMOD/LSA ASAP prior to personnel
     processing to facilitate efficient passenger flow. The IDO/wing LOGMOD Administrator
     then exports the filled requirements data from LOGMOD/LSA (via .CHK file), by chalk,
     and provides the data file to the PDF for import it into MANPER-B for personnel
     processing and to produce TDY orders. The PDF exports electronic passenger data (via
     .PAX file) from MANPER-B, by chalk, and passes it to the transportation passenger
     specialists operating CMOS/GATES. CMOS/GATES will generate the electronic
     passenger manifest based on the order and files received from MANPER-B and pushes
     electronic deployment data transactions to GTN to enable ITV.                  NOTE: For
     commercially ticketed passengers, MANPER-B has a free form, alphanumeric field to
     update flight information and estimated time of arrival. This is used to pass to the gaining
     PERSCO teams, allowing them to meet flights and also have an idea of who and how
     many passengers are on a specific flight. Non-Air Force personnel will use their Service
     specific system to produce ITV data. If those units are incapable of providing ITV data
     they will contact USTRANSCOM for assistance
     18.8.2.11. En route locations with CMOS/GATES capability will ensure manifests
     reflect any passenger load changes prior to aircraft departure. This updated data will be

       sent electronically to onward destination(s) when originated from CMOS or GATES
       locations.
NOTE: Until the CMOS/GATES interface becomes fully functional, the enroute location (ISB)
will need to rely on the passenger data file via email or hard copy to assist in remanifesting
(transloading) at transload locations.
18.9. PEACETIME AIRLIFT OPERATIONS (NON-DEPLOYMENT)
   18.9.1. Operational Support Airlift Operations (Non-Deployment).       This section is
   applicable to missions not in direct support of exercises, contingencies and SAAMs.
   Applicable missions include Operational Support Airlift (OSA), Training, Refueling, and
   Aeromedical (to capture patient movement, development of TRANSCOM Regulating and
   Command and Control Evacuation System [TRAC2ES] interface with GTN is ongoing).
   18.9.2. Passengers traveling on OSA, training, refueling, or aeromedical missions must
   report to the Air Passenger Terminal at the designated time to process for their flight (see
   note below). Passenger terminal management determines the designated time as it relates to
   Distinguished Visitor (DV) movement requirements when DV travel is planned. The Air
   Passenger Terminal or designated agency/representative is the manifesting point for
   passengers traveling on these missions. Passengers must have required travel documentation
   (Travel Orders, Military Identification Card, etc.), meet travel eligibility requirements in
   DOD 4515.13R, Air Transportation Eligibility and be manifested IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part
   I, Passenger Movement. Distinguished Visitors (O-6s/Execs/Aides/civilian equivalents and
   higher) may have Protocol or designated representative coordinate reporting times and
   check-in with terminal management, allowing DVs to proceed directly to their departure
   location. CMOS, or GATES at locations with AMC terminals, will be used to process the
   passengers and transmit ITV data to GTN. NOTE: Alternatives for duty passengers on OSA
   missions reporting to Air Passenger Terminals include:
       18.9.2.1. Designated non-AMC agency load passenger/cargo data into CMOS or
       provide load passenger/cargo data to the AMC terminal for input into GATES; or
       18.9.2.2. Designated non-AMC agency will send (fax, e-mail, hand carry diskette, etc.)
       passenger/cargo information to designated location for entry into CMOS/GATES. Using
       this methodology, passenger/cargo data will be passed to the designated location for input
       into CMOS/GATES in time to meet data entry times identified in the DTR and this AFI.
   18.9.3. At origin/POE. Cargo shipments will be processed through the Distribution Flight
   (DF) for onward movement via the DTS. CMOS, or GATES at AMC aerial ports, will be
   used to in-check shipment into the system. DF will prepare proper labeling and
   documentation prior to delivering the shipment to the freight terminal. Barcode labels will be
   used to expedite shipment processing through the DTS. DF will transmit ATCMD data to the
   ACA. Once the shipment arrives at the freight terminal, the ATCMD data will be compared
   to the shipping labels to ensure completeness and accuracy of data. The Cargo Processing
   function will in-check the cargo using CMOS, or at AMC aerial ports, GATES after all
   inspections have been completed. The air terminal activity will prepare air manifests and
   diskette(s) and ensure they are placed on the aircraft. CMOS, or at AMC aerial ports, GATES
   will be used to generate an electronic cargo manifest and diskette to accompany manifested
   cargo and transmit manifest data to GTN. If CMOS/GATES is not available to produce the
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                        165


   manifest that location will contact their supporting major command/higher headquarters for
   support.
   18.9.4. At destination/POD. Receipt for cargo using CMOS, or at AMC aerial ports,
   GATES. Prepare documentation/manifests for onward movement as required by mode.
   18.9.5. At final destination. Receipt for cargo. Terminating locations without
   CMOS/GATES capability will contact their supporting major command/higher headquarters
   for support.
   18.9.6. For missions departing without any passengers and/or cargo onboard, the
   organization with mission flight-following responsibility (Command Post) will enter ―0‖ in
   the Passenger and Payload entries in the applicable C2 system (GDSS or C2IPS) within 15
   minutes after aircraft departure. Passenger and cargo information can be obtained from the
   aircraft commander or the Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC) at locations with an
   AMC presence.         https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-
   AM-73.
18.10. Global Decision Support System (GDSS) - ITV Feeder System.
   18.10.1. To facilitate the sharing/marrying of information, GDSS uses the AMC mission as a
   means to attach related planning and execution data (e.g., airlift requirement, departure,
   arrival, advisories, delays, load data, diplomatic clearance, human remain, crew data,
   assigned tail number, controller remark, etc.). To accommodate both general user &
   interfacing system requirements, each mission has a minimum of two mission identifiers
   (e.g., Leg Mission Identifier, Primary Mission Key, etc.). The Leg Mission Identifier is a user
   entered 12 alphanumeric field that is assigned to a specific mission or mission segment
   within a mission. The Primary Mission Key is a computer generated 12 alphanumeric field
   that provides a unique key to reference a mission throughout the mission‘s life cycle.
   18.10.2. GTN uses the mission identifiers to link C2 and Transportation system information;
   to provide the deployment community a mission identifier so that user can track the items
   they want moved.
18.11. Commercial Web-Based Tracking Capabilities.
   18.11.1. Most domestic commercial transportation companies have established web-based
   tracking capabilities that can be used to complement DOD ITV. Domestic carriers that do
   business with the DOD are mandated to link their EDI feeds to GTN. GTN is the sanctioned
   DOD ITV system, but utilizing a commercial company‘s web-based tracking capability can
   significantly assist the customer in determining the location of an asset if the customer
   possesses the commercial tracking number. Worldwide Express Carrier and the DOD
   Domestic BPA web-based tracking sites are posted on the Cargo Movement CoP:
   https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/openCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-TR-A1.           Go to
   Carrier Web Links.
   18.11.2. For the Air Force AFMC has developed TRACKER, an Internet web site that
   provides users with information from its data warehouse, which is filled by numerous data
   systems used by the DOD. The web site is actually a data mining and display tool for the
   Oracle database. TRACKER access and user‘s manual are found at
   https://tracker.wpafb.af.mil.

      18.11.2.1. Information in the TRACKER database is aligned and presented to fulfill a
      single purpose: to provide the user with information on their requisitions, with emphasis
      placed on the flight line base level user. There are numerous data systems that provide
      management oversight on many things, but there are none that focus on getting
      information about requisitions to the lowest level personnel that really need it.

                                         Chapter 20

 COUNTER-CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR HIGH
 YIELD EXPLOSIVES (CBRNE) REQUIREMENTS, TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND
       PROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFYING, MARKING, AND MANAGING
                 CONTAMINATED CARGO SHIPMENTS

20.1. General Information. This chapter contains the procedures for identification, marking,
and maintenance of cargo shipments contaminated during hostilities or contingencies. Cargo
shipments may be contaminated by any number of means, whether chemical, biological,
radiological, or nuclear. Contamination by chemical means is considered the primary threat to
cargo shipments. During a conflict or contingency, minimize the potential for cargo
contamination, while continuing to support the mission. If cargo shipments become
contaminated, the shipments must be decontaminated as soon as possible, identified, and
properly marked in accordance with Air Force guidance. The primary resources for the data
contained in this chapter are AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and
Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards, and the Counter-Chemical Warfare
Concept of Operations (C-CW CONOPS) approved MAJCOM training materials.
   20.1.1. The development of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) within the cargo
   movement operations realm used analysis of field operations, functional area publications,
   lessons learned, as well as feedback from functional area managers and subject matter
   experts.
   20.1.2. These TTPs also incorporate best practices and solutions to mitigate the
   consequences of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) attacks and
   sustain operations in NBCC environments. The decision to use them depends upon the threat
   and conditions present at the airbase. Include NBCC defense TTP in unit or work center
   checklists and job guides. Functional Area Managers (FAM) should review field unit
   solutions and include common TTP into functional area publications and enlisted Career
   Field Education and Training Plans (CFETP). The Civil Engineer Readiness Flight can
   provide assistance on NBCC defense actions and help functional area experts develop TTP to
   support specific operations.
   20.1.3. The TTPs in the following paragraphs do not supercede or replace requirements
   within equipment T.O.s. Follow established procedures for safe operations. Identify conflicts
   or hazards through the Air Force T.O. System or Safety System.
20.2. Cargo Movement Responsibilities:
   20.2.1. Airbase contamination can significantly disrupt air and ground cargo movements if
   the Unit Control Center (UCC) and cargo handlers do not plan and execute pre- and post-
   attack actions. The UCC must coordinate and identify task priorities and obtain airbase
   support when needed. Cargo handlers must effectively employ pre- and post-attack measures
   to minimize mission degradation and enable sustained operations. This includes the
   coordinated use of a system that balances the mission criticality level (importance) of the
   cargo with the hazard category (residual danger) associated with the materials to determine
   the appropriate action. Cargo handlers will require assistance from their unit post-attack
   reconnaissance team and Civil Engineer Readiness to determine the degree of contamination
 172                                     AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


    that may be present on the cargo or in the cargo storage and movement areas. Note: The
    term ―Cargo Handlers‖ applies to personnel in Air Force Specialty Codes 2T0XX and
    2T2XX. Personnel in other AFSCs exercise CBRNE procedures outlined in their career field
    directives.
    20.2.2. The UCC controlling cargo movement will use Table 20.1. to identify the mission
    criticality of the material. Conspicuously mark this code on the cargo.

                                                 regardless of the existence of contamination.
R – Routine                                      Mission can be delayed until contamination
                                                 levels are such that MOPP 4 is not required,
                                                 regardless of how long the contamination takes
                                                 to dissipate.
N – Negligible                                   Mission can be delayed until there is no
                                                 measurable indication of contamination. This
                                                 type cargo should not normally be accepted
                                                 inside the cargo movement area. Room must
                                                 be saved for higher priority cargo.
    20.2.3. Use Table 20.2. to determine the hazard category associated with the cargo.

                         drive this category designation.
    20.2.4. To support cargo movement activities in a contaminated environment, cargo handlers
    must possess 20 books of M8 paper and 1 NBC marking kit (with two chemical sign refills).
    20.2.5. Contamination avoidance is the key to success with cargo movement operations.
    Because of time constraints required by Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD)
    operations or other mission requirements and our technological inability to decontaminate
    several substances, contamination avoidance is the single most effective protective measure.
    As with all other operations, the proper implementation of contamination avoidance and
    contamination control measures will directly influence the amount and extent of
    decontamination operations required in a post-attack environment. These measures also
    directly influence when an individual or work center has to assume Mission-oriented
    Protective Posture (MOPP) 4 in an otherwise clean area because contaminated cargo entered
    the site. Accomplish the following pre-attack contamination avoidance measures.
       20.2.5.1. To the maximum extent possible, place cargo underneath overhead cover. This
       can be provided through storage space inside facilities or the use of barrier materials. If
       using barrier materials, triple wrap each pallet. Place one layer under the pallet net and
       two layers over the pallet net. Remove the top layer and replace if it becomes
       contaminated. Place M8 paper on the outermost horizontal layer of the barrier material.
       When a contaminated layer of material is removed, place M8 paper on the next horizontal
       layer.
       20.2.5.2. Develop a Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM) or an Improved CAM (next
       generation CAM) footprint of the cargo storage and movement areas. By annotating
       what CAM readings exist in a known clean environment (false positive), personnel will
       not misidentify the hazard associated with a pallet of cargo and they will not waste time
       and energy attempting to decontaminate something that is clean. Refer to T.O. 11H2-20-
       1, Operator‘s Manual for the Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM), for CAM operating and
       maintenance procedures.

       20.2.5.3. Place M8 paper in multiple locations throughout the area. As a minimum,
       position it on every pallet and on flat surfaces in open areas. Do not place it under facility
       eaves or pavilion roofs.
   20.2.6. In addition to the required post-attack reconnaissance and self-aid, buddy care
   activities, accomplish the following actions. Note: The timing of post-attack reconnaissance
   and self-aid, buddy care activities depend on the situation and direction from the airbase and
   unit chain of command. Unless otherwise directed, do not accomplish the following
   activities until after the liquid deposition phase has ended (about 60 minutes).
       20.2.6.1. Determine the contamination status of each individual cargo pallet. Annotate
       and report the result.
       20.2.6.2. If a single sheet of plastic protected contaminated assets, remove and replace
       the covering within six hours (the faster the better). If a double or triple sheet of plastic
       or canvas protected contaminated assets, carefully remove the outer layer and replace it
       as time permits. Carefully roll the material so the contaminated side is rolled to the
       inside and dispose of the material as contaminated waste.
       20.2.6.3. If barrier materials of any type did not protect the contaminated cargo, mark the
       item as contaminated in accordance with Air Force and unit marking procedures, (NBC
       marking kit, signs on all sides). If contaminated with more than one type of agent
       (chemical and biological for instance), attach both types of signs to the cargo.
20.2.6.3.1. Further, for prioritizing cargo movement, cargo handlers should annotate the front of
the appropriate NBC Marking Kit sign with the mission criticality (see Table 20.1.) and hazard
category (see Table 20.2.) designator. The code for the mission criticality designator will be the
first letter of the appropriate word i.e., ―C‖ represents critical, and ―N‖ represents negligible.
The code for the hazard category is the number designator itself (i.e., ―3‖ represents a VX, L
contact hazard without a measurable vapor hazard).
           20.2.6.3.2. Annotate the specific agent or agents, date, time of marking, and the
           temperature (either Fahrenheit or Celsius) at the time of the marking operation on the
           rear of the marking sign or signs. If using Sampling Kits (biological agent samplers),
           annotate the rear of the sign whether the hand-held assay tests are positive or
           negative. Report the contamination status of each pallet to the UCC.
   20.2.7. Cargo handlers should use Table 20.3. through Table 20.7. to determine what
   decontamination actions, if any, are necessary based on the contaminated cargo‘s mission
   criticality level and its hazard category.

   20.2.8. Movement of contaminated cargo. Use the following guidelines when loading and
   transporting contaminated cargo.
       20.2.8.1. Determine the contamination status of the material handling equipment (K-
       loaders or forklifts) and the transport vehicle or vehicles. Determine if the items have
       measurable amounts of contamination. Attempt to locate the pockets of contamination if
       possible. This may entail the use of a CAM to pinpoint pockets of dirt and grease that
       may house agents in liquid or dusty form that M8 paper does not readily identify.
       20.2.8.2. If the transport vehicle is uncontaminated, take the following precautions to
       keep it clean during the cargo movement process.
              20.2.8.2.1. Expediently decontaminate the portions of the material handling
              equipment exposed to either the cargo pallet or the transport vehicle (forklift tines and
              rollers on the K-Loader). Use M295 decontamination kit or 5 percent chlorine bleach
              solution to decontaminate.
              20.2.8.2.2. Personnel should ensure to place plastic or another barrier material in the
              bed of the transport vehicle over the area that the cargo pallet(s) will sit on.
              20.2.8.2.3. Replace the outer layer of barrier material on the cargo pallet(s) if
              necessary.
              20.2.8.2.4. The transport vehicle operator should be the only person in the transport
              vehicle and must wear the appropriate level of IPE.
              20.2.8.2.5. Local cargo handlers should perform the actual cargo loading. Cargo
              handlers should not touch or stand on or inside the vehicle unless absolutely
              necessary. If they must touch or stand on or inside the vehicle, they should use
              decontamination troughs containing 5 percent chlorine solutions to decontaminate
              their gloves and boots before they make contact.
              20.2.8.2.6. Check the clean transport vehicle for evidence of cross-contamination and
              decontaminate with the M295 decontamination kit if contaminated.

         20.2.8.2.7. Seal vehicle chocks or other transport vehicle accessories that may have
         come in contact with contaminated surfaces inside a plastic bag prior to loading.
      20.2.8.3. Appropriately mark the vehicle and the cargo to clearly identify the hazard
      associated with the contaminated cargo.
  20.2.9. Use the following guidelines when loading and transporting clean cargo after attacks
  with chemical or biological agents.
      20.2.9.1. Determine the contamination status of the material handling equipment
      (forklifts and K-loaders) and the transport vehicle or vehicles.
      20.2.9.2. If the material handling equipment and/or transport vehicle is contaminated,
      take the following precautions to prevent them from cross-contaminating the 463L cargo
      pallet during the cargo movement process.
         20.2.9.2.1. Expediently decontaminate the portions of the material handling
         equipment that will come in contact with the cargo pallet.
         20.2.9.2.2. Place at least two sheets of plastic or another layer of barrier material in
         the bed of the transport vehicle over the area that the cargo pallet or pallets will sit on.
         20.2.9.2.3. Ensure that the pallet has at least a double wrap of barrier material.
         20.2.9.2.4. The transport vehicle operator should be the only person in the transport
         vehicle and must wear the appropriate level of IPE.
         20.2.9.2.5. Local cargo handlers should perform the actual cargo loading. Cargo
         handlers should not touch or stand on or inside the vehicle or vehicles unless
         absolutely necessary. If they must touch or stand on or inside the vehicle or vehicles,
         they should use decontamination troughs containing 5 percent chlorine solutions to
         decontaminate their gloves and boots after they make contact.
         20.2.9.2.6. Check the pallet or pallets for evidence of cross-contamination and
         decontaminate with the M295 decontamination kit if contamination is present.
      20.2.9.3. Appropriately mark the vehicle to clearly identify the associated hazard.
  20.2.10. Cargo movement personnel should accomplish the following actions when they
  discover they will be receiving contaminated cargo from another location.
      20.2.10.1. Acquire all available information concerning the cargo.           To include the
      following information:
         20.2.10.1.1. A description of what the specific cargo is (spare parts for special
         purpose vehicles for example) and to whom on the airbase it belongs.
         20.2.10.1.2. A description of what type of suspected contamination is present on the
         cargo.
         20.2.10.1.3. The physical condition of the cargo (i.e., triple wrapped with barrier
         material, unconstrained rolling stock).
         20.2.10.1.4. The time of cargo contamination in relation to the anticipated reception
         time at the installation.

        20.2.10.1.5. The status of the vehicle operator or operators (i.e., are there any
        casualties and will anyone require the use of a Contamination Control Area (CCA)).
     20.2.10.2. Contact Civil Engineer Readiness and the unit expecting delivery. Request
     assistance with an assessment of the contamination hazard and mission criticality
     associated with the cargo. Use this assessment to determine the degree of required IPE or
     reception activities. Also, use this assessment to change the specific cargo delivery
     location on the installation if necessary.
     20.2.10.3. If the cargo does not have a high mission priority (as stated by the receiving
     unit), assess the ability of the unit and/or cargo handlers to isolate the cargo upon
     reception. If choosing the isolation option, clearly cordon off the area surrounding the
     pallet or pallets with the NBC Marking Kit. Use a cordon radius of 25 feet or as directed
     by Civil Engineer Readiness personnel.
     20.2.10.4. If personnel must expediently use contaminated cargo to facilitate mission
     operations, the receiving unit and/or cargo handlers should take the following actions:
        20.2.10.4.1. Ensure reception personnel are in the appropriate MOPP (normally
        MOPP 4).
        20.2.10.4.2. Remove the layers of barrier material (if present), cargo nets, and/or
        pallet banding and dispose of these items as contaminated waste.
        20.2.10.4.3. Verify the type and level of contamination (for example, VX in liquid
        form on metal boxes with no measurable vapor hazard).
        20.2.10.4.4. If feasible, remove the specific cargo from its packaging configuration
        (wooden boxes for instance) and dispose of the packing material as contaminated
        waste.
        20.2.10.4.5. Accomplish appropriate decontamination activities based on the extent
        of contamination, agent or agents present, cargo surface, and time available. Contact
        Civil Engineer Readiness to determine the most effective method.
        20.2.10.4.6. If the cargo items themselves are contaminated, mark them appropriately
        so that work center personnel will immediately recognize the potential residual

                                          Chapter 21

       OTHER CARGO MOVEMENT INFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE
                         REQUIREMENTS

21.1. Forecasting Cargo Requirements. The Air Force is required to submit forecasting
requirements for airlift and sealift to AMC and SDDC for the purpose of scheduling movements
and setting billing rates. SSCO consolidates inputs from MAJCOMs and submits forecast
requirements in the format prescribed by the DTR, Part II. The forecast incorporates historical
movement data combined with known or projected movement requirements. Program managers
will identify ammunition, aircraft engine, missile, Tactical Air Missile Program (TAMP),
helicopters, support equipment, special weapons, communications equipment, and vehicle
requirements to the SSCO when known, for budget and forecasting purposes. The SSCO will
submit required forecasts to meet established suspense dates.
   21.1.1. Submission of long-and short-range cargo airlift requirements will follow the
   timelines and formats in DTR, Part II.
   21.1.2. Submission of sealift cargo requirements will follow the timelines and formats in
   DTR, Part II.
21.2. SAAM Requests. See DTR, Part II, for SAAM request format and instructions.
21.3. Shipment of Human Remains. Refer to AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, Chapter
5; AFI 24-101, paragraph 3.22.; and AMCI 24-101, volume 11, section C, paragraph 30. For
additional guidance, refer to DTR, Part VII.
21.4. DELETED
21.5. Public Highway Movements. The TO is the installation focal point for ensuring that Air
Force cargo moving over public highways conforms to Federal, State, and local laws,
regulations, and ordinances relating to vehicle size and weight limitations. Except as shown in
the DTR, Part II, and Part III, vehicular movements over public highways must have required
permits issued by State authorities.
   21.5.1. Directory of Permit Officials. TOs maintain a copy of SDDCTEA's The Directory of
   Highway Permit Officials and Mobilization Movement Control Coordinators (MOBCON). It
   contains contact information for state permit officials and a summary of state size and weight
   limits. SDDC Transportation Engineering Agency (SDDC-SA), 720 Thimble Shoals Blvd.,
   Suite 130, Newport News VA 23606-4537, publishes and issues this directory. The
   Directory may be accessed at SDDCTEA web-site: http://www.tea.army.mil/ (user
   identification and password must be requested).
   21.5.2. Military Cargo Essential to National Defense. Occasionally, certain highway
   movements require certification, as "Essential to National Defense" due to mission needs.
   This normally applies to essential cargo that must move over the public highway because the
   cargo cannot be reduced in size or weight to move by another mode. Certification for this
   type of movement is supported differently depending on whether movement is via
   commercial carriers or military resources.
AFI24-203_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                       181


      21.5.2.1. For certification for movement via commercial carrier refer to DTR, Part II,
      and submit certification with the rate tender. Justification of essentiality should be
      generated by the shipping activity and submitted to the TO. Request assistance from the
      SDDC Deployment Support Command or theater Combatant Commander.
      21.5.2.2. For certification of movement via organic military resources refer to DTR, Part
      III. Justification of essentiality will be generated by the shipping activity and submitted
      to the TO. Refer to SDDCTEA‘s Directory of Highway Permit and MOBCON Officials
      for further guidance. See DTR, Part III, Appendix F.
21.6. Other Administrative Requirements.
   21.6.1. Information Collections. No information collections are created by this Publication.

Active RFID (aRFID)—uses an internal power source (battery) within the tag to continuously
power the tag and it RF communication circuitry. Active RFID allows very low-level signals to
be received by the tag (because the reader does not need to answer the tag), and the tag can
generate high-level signals back to the reader, driven from its internal power source.
Additionally, the Active RFID tag is continuously powered, whether in the reader field or not.
Active RFID readers (interrogators) generally operate at the .3 mill-watt power level, and can
provide communication ranges of 100 meters or more. Active RFID operating at 433.92 MHz is
almost universally applicable over the globe and has approvals. Active RFID is a proven tool for
providing inside-the-box, in transit visibility of contents in containers and pallets and it has
mitigated some of the cost experienced during current deployment operations. The infrastructure
to support deployment operations has begun fielding.
