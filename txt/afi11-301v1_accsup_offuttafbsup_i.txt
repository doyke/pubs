SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is a major revision and must be reviewed entirely. It includes initial guidance for the new
Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) career field (AFSC 1P0X1), which includes and merges the
former Aircrew Life Support (AFSC 1T1X1) and Survival Equipment (AFSC 2A7X4) career
fields. It modifies MAJCOM and other agency responsibilities, and updates office symbols.
Life Support Officers (LSO) are referred to as Flight Equipment Officers (FEO). Previous
guidance relating to Mobility, CBRN, and contingency operations has been moved to AFI 11-
301, Volume 3, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Combat Operations, (forthcoming).

Program Guidance Letter (PGL), Aircrew Life Support and Survival Equipment Career
Field Merger, dated 12 March 2008 implemented the Chief of Staff of the Air Force direction
to merge these two career fields, and created a new AFE (AFSC 1P0X1) career field with all
functions, manpower, and personnel organizationally aligned to the Operations Support
Squadron (OSS) under the Operations Group (OG) to include all military, civil service, and
contractor equivalent. A copy of this PGL can be obtained from HQ USAF/A3O-AT
(Operational Training Division).

(ACC) This document is substantially revised and must be reviewed entirely. It incorporates
numerous messages and policy changes unique to the ACC AFE program. Among the changes
too numerous to mention in this section, this revision outlines technician training requirements,
aircraft AFE requirements, deployment/contingency operations, and quality control program
guidance.

(OFFUTTAFB) This document has been substantially revised and must be completely
reviewed. Changes include assignment of initial task certification responsibility, assignment of
AFE tool kit identifiers, correction of aircraft pre-positioned equipment configuration,

establishment of survival kit requirements, and establishment of local aircrew arming
procedures.

                                        OVERVIEW

1.1. Mission. Provide USAF aircrew safe and effective aircrew flight equipment and programs
to increase aircrew performance. Protect and sustain human life during flight operations.
Prepare aircrew and passengers to survive, affect their rescue, and return to duty if forced to
abandon their aircraft during an emergency. Provide aircrew protection from effects of
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons.
1.2. Program Objectives:
   1.2.1. Increase combat capability of the total weapon system by enhancing and maximizing
   the performance and survivability of the aircrew.
   1.2.2. Reduce injuries and increase survival rates by providing aircrew and passengers with
   the best equipment available through new technologies, system training, and quality system
   maintenance.
   1.2.3. Identify requirements for modernization and new equipment by analyzing: customer-
   validated operational requirements, operational deficiencies, USAF suggestions and
   recommendations, Air Force Technical Order (TO) improvement reports, aircraft mishap
   investigation and safety report recommendations, and joint developmental programs from
   other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies.
   1.2.4. Train aircrew and passengers to use their Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) in a
   manner that reinforces recall during emergency situations. Training should be accomplished
   using training equipment that mirrors operational equipment and realistic scenarios, in which
   aircrew and passengers are likely to encounter. Realistic training will ensure aircrew and
   passengers have confidence in their equipment and increase their ability to use it.
   1.2.5. Train and qualify AFE personnel (Air Force Specialty Code [AFSC] 1P0X1) to
   maintain AFE in optimum condition and to conduct Aircrew Flight Equipment Continuation
   Training (AFECT). Provide units the suitable resources to perform optimal equipment
   maintenance.

       procedures, and a complete 30-day inspection of aircraft/ejection seat integrated
       parachute assemblies and survival kits satisfy the requirement for an integrated AFE
       PTE. A complete 30-day inspection of a non-integrated parachute, i.e., carried to/from
       the AFE section, satisfies the requirement for a non-integrated parachute inspection. A
       complete review of applicable parachute documents for accuracy is part of the 30-day
       parachute inspection.
3.8. Composite Tool Kit (CTK) Program. The objectives of the CTK program are to prevent
and eliminate Foreign Object Damage (FOD) to aircraft, engines, missiles, training and support
equipment, and to reduce tool cost through effective control of assets.
   3.8.1. Establish a CTK and lost tool procedure program to control and account for tools used
   in each AFE section IAW AFI 21-101, Chapter 10, and AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 13,
   Chapter 8, as well as MAJCOM, and wing/unit directives.
NOTE: AFE sections are authorized to manually track all their CTKs, or ALERTS is authorized
as well for AFE sections to track their CTKs. AFE sections are not required to use the
automated Tool Accountability System (TAS). Units will develop local tracking procedures that
will include quantity of serviceable/unserviceable oxygen connectors dispatched to and from the
flightline (if applicable).

   3.8.2. Each tool, item of equipment, or consumable contained in a CTK has an assigned
   location identified either by inlay cuts in the shape of the item, shadowed layout, or
   silhouette. No more than one item is stored in a cutout, shadow, or silhouette except for tools
   issued in sets such as drill bits, allen wrenches, apexes, or paired items (e.g., gloves, booties).
   NOTE: Personal tools are NOT authorized on the flightline or in any maintenance area. (e.g.,
   Mini-Mag type flashlights, Leatherman type multi-tools, buck knives).
   3.8.3. Units must place the 9-digit Equipment Identifier (EID) on all CTKs, tools not
   assigned to a box, and dispatchable equipment that is of sufficient size. The 9-digit EID must
   be placed on the outside of dispatchable CTKs. Tools located inside the tool box may be
   marked with less than 9-digits but must contain the 4-digit World Wide Identification
   (WWID) and identifying characters that tie the tool back to the CTK. For example, tools
   inside an assigned dispatchable CTK ―U6JG00001‖ may be marked ―U6JG1‖.
       3.8.3.1. (Offutt) A list of CTK EIDs used at Offutt is provided in Table 3.8

      AIRCREW FLIGHT EQUIPMENT CONTINUATION TRAINING (AFECT)

5.1. Purpose. AFECT consists of ground training events (not ancillary training) listed in Table
5.1 of this instruction and is provided for each aircrew member, designated non-rated personnel,
and passengers to refresh and enhance their proficiency and knowledge in all AFECT events.
This chapter establishes specific requirements and applies to all AFECT Instructors (AFECTI),
aircrew and personnel who fly. Training equipment will be configured to mirror operational
equipment and all training will be realistic, hands-on and student centered to the maximum
extent possible. This is the standard method for developing aircrew proficiency. AFECT will be
conducted in a distraction-free facility/environment.
5.2. Responsibilities:
   5.2.1. AFECT will be conducted IAW Table 5.1 of this instruction. MAJCOMs will
   supplement this instruction to tailor AFECT courses to fulfill their specific requirements. The
   361 TRS/TRR will update their AFE Air Force Master Lesson Plans (AFMLP) based on
   current safety information provided by the Air Force Safety Center and MAJCOMs. AFE
   Superintendent/FEO, upon notification from their MAJCOMs, will download the update
   information from the AFE AFMLP CoP website:
   https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=AE-OP-00-01.
   5.2.2. AFECT instructors may be an FEO, qualified instructor aircrew, or AFE (1P0X1)
   training instructor. MAJCOMs and ANG units will supplement this instruction with
   requirements for assigning and certifying AFECT instructors.
       5.2.2.1. Emergency egress training will be taught by a FEO (rated officer) or by an
       appointed rated officer and qualified instructor aircrew designated in writing by the group
       FEO. EXCEPTION: Civil service and contractor equivalent may conduct AFECT
       course(s) if specifically hired for that purpose and ANG AFECTIs.
5.3. AFECT Event Descriptions. Lead Commands, IAW AFPD 10-9, Lead Operating
Command Weapon Systems Management, will be OPR for developing core curriculum for each
of the following blocks of instruction. AFECT event instruction may be consolidated as long as
curriculum requirements are met and individual events are tracked by the designated identifiers
in Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS). Lead commands will provide AFECT event
guidance in applicable AFI 11-2MDS-series, Vol 1 publications.
   5.3.1. Aircrew Flight Equipment Familiarization (LL01): One time event, per base
   assignment, conducted prior to the first flight at home station to familiarize aircrew members
   with local AFE items availability, issue, use, pre-flight, and post-flight procedures. This
   training will be provided for subsequent re-assignments to the same base.
   5.3.2. Emergency Egress Training, Ejection Seat (LL02): Evaluates aircrew and passenger
   ability to demonstrate proficiency in air and ground emergency egress/ejection procedures. In
   aircraft with multi-crew ejection seat capability, stress importance of aircrew coordination
   actions in emergency situations. Ensure aircrews are aware of their responsibilities for
   conducting safety and passenger briefings IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.

      5.3.2.1. (Added-ACC) EPTs will be functional and mirror operational equipment to the
      maximum extent possible (including oxygen panel, JHMCS connector, AERPS). Contact
      Det 1 ACC/TRSS, Luke AFB, AZ for assistance with servicing EPT.
   5.3.3. Emergency Egress Training, Non-Ejection Seat (LL03): Evaluates aircrew and
   passenger ability to demonstrate proficiency in air and ground emergency egress procedures.
   Stress the importance of aircrew coordination, aircrew and passenger responsibilities and use
   of appropriate emergency egress equipment. Ensure aircrews are aware of their
   responsibilities for conducting safety and passenger briefings IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.
   5.3.4. Aircrew Chemical Defense Training (ACDT) (LL04): An academic and equipment
   training session in which the aircrew member demonstrates and performs donning, doffing,
   and buddy dressing procedures using either the first or second generation ACDE or Aircrew
   Eye/Respiratory Protection (AERP) equipment. This training also includes information on
   hazards and limitations of wearing the equipment properly and improperly, preflight
   procedures, aircraft integration, and parachute descent emergency procedures. Each aircrew
   will demonstrate procedures during their initial class; subsequent classes require a minimum
   of 10% of aircrew participants to dress out and demonstrate ACCA decontamination
   processing procedures.
   5.3.5. Egress Training with ACDE (LL05): Evaluates the aircrew‘s ability to demonstrate
   proficiency in the use of primary as well as secondary air and ground egress procedures
   while wearing ACDE. Training will stress the unique changes in procedures to include added
   difficulties aircrew would and could experience as a result of wearing ACDE.
   5.3.6. Aircrew Flight Equipment Training (AFET) (LL06) (formerly Aircrew Life Support
   Equipment [ALSE] Training): An academic and equipment training event, in which aircrew
   members demonstrate their ability to locate, preflight, and use all aircrew and passenger AFE
   carried aboard unit aircraft or issued to aircrew members. This training includes the
   limitations and safety issues related to AFE. Additionally, include aircrew clothing items and
   information on hazards associated with improper wear and failure to use only authorized
   clothing and equipment items.
      5.3.6.1. (Added-ACC) Brief aircrew on responsibilities of AFE IAW this supplement.
   5.3.7. With the exception of ARC, AFMC, and AFSPC units, which do not have SERE
   (1T0X1) personnel assigned, AFE sections are not authorized or manned to conduct the Code
   of Conduct/SERE training outlined in AFI 16-1301, Survival Evasion Resistance Escape
   (SERE) Operations.
5.4. Formal Training Requirements:
   5.4.1. All aircrew members must attend formal training requirements as identified in AFI 16-
   1301.

   to the appropriate MAJCOM AFE focal point at least 60 days in advance of the requested
   training date. AFRC and ANG will request quotas IAW AFRC and ANG procedures.
   5.4.4. The group FEO or AFE superintendent will control and manage the wing‘s AFE
   formal supplemental course allocations. Cancellations or substitutions will be accomplished
   by contacting the appropriate MAJCOM or ANG AFE focal point not later than 30 days prior
   to class start date. Return all allocations that cannot be used to the appropriate MAJCOM or
   ANG AFE focal point for redistribution at least 30 days prior to class start date.
5.5. AFECT Requirements:
   5.5.1. Minimum Training Requirements. Table 5.1 of this instruction specifies the required
   AFECT events and frequencies for aircrew members and passengers.
   5.5.2. Failure to accomplish AFECT at the required intervals IAW AFI 11-2MDS-series,
   Vol 1/Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) tasking memo, will result in grounding or non-combat
   mission ready status.
      5.5.2.1. (Added-ACC) Failure to accomplish AFECT at the required intervals IAW AFI
      11-2MDS-series, V1, as amended by ACC/Ready Aircrew Program tasking memo, will
      result in grounding or non-combat mission ready status. Not applicable to AFRC units.
   5.5.3. If an aircrew member, current in all AFECT events, is TDY to perform flying duties to
   a location where a training capability does not exist and the individual becomes due in an
   AFECT event, training must be accomplished before first flight at home station. AFRC and
   ANG FMs will determine time frame required to complete training upon arrival at home
   station.
   5.5.4. Emergency Egress and Parachute Descent Training (PDT) should be given
   concurrently when practical (ejection or non-ejection aircraft).
   5.5.5. Flight Surgeons will receive AFECT at frequencies determined IAW MDS-specific
   guidance.
      5.5.5.1. (Added-ACC) If not covered by specific MDS guidance, flight surgeons will
      receive egress once every 90 days on primary assigned aircraft. The FEO may waive this
      requirement up to 180 days for those flight surgeons who demonstrate proficiency in the
      aircraft on a case-by-case basis. AFRC/ANG units require Operations Group commander
      (or equivalent) approval for this waiver.
   5.5.6. Aircrew members arriving PCS or visiting aircrews, such as those assigned to the
   inspector general, test squadrons, etc., are not required to re-accomplish egress or PDT if
   source documentation of currency can be obtained (e.g., ARMS) and they are current in the
   assigned aircraft. However, training on local unit specific AFE and rescue requirements will
   be accomplished.
   5.5.7. Aircrew members previously qualified in a given ejection seat equipped aircraft and
   currently in transition to a different model of the aircraft, or undergoing upgrade training in
   the same type of aircraft, may receive egress training at the regular interval from date last
   accomplished, if the escape systems and procedures are the same in both aircraft models.
AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010                                                 67


   5.5.8. Aircrew members in transition from one type of ejection seat equipped aircraft to
   another and awaiting a Fighter Training Unit (FTU) slot will receive Emergency Egress and
   PDT at intervals determined by respective MAJCOM.
   5.5.9. Student aircrew members assigned to an FTU will receive emergency egress and PDT
   training IAW applicable syllabus.
   5.5.10. Initial and periodic ACDE training will be conducted IAW appropriate 11-2MDS-
   series, Vol 1 publications, this instruction, applicable TOs, and approved AFMLPs.
   5.5.11. An aircrew member may be credited with ACDT (LL04) during local operational
   readiness exercises provided all AFECT requirements and objectives are satisfied (i.e.
   crewmember donned chemical defense ensemble and subsequently processed through
   ACCA).
   5.5.12. (Added-ACC) Aircrew on inactive flying status, to include indoctrination fliers,
   will receive, as a minimum, emergency egress, EPT (formerly PDT), and AFE training no
   earlier than 72 hours prior to flight. Those flying over water beyond gliding distance to land
   will also receive water survival academics and hands on training with life preservers/life
   rafts. If the 72 hours are exceeded before flight, training will be re-accomplished. Emergency
   egress training includes cockpit familiarization, use of oxygen/communication controls and
   switches, and manual bailout procedures training, if applicable.
5.6. AFECT Safety. Safety is paramount when planning and conducting AFECT. As a
minimum, the following will apply:
   5.6.1. The group FEO or AFE superintendent, with assistance from the local safety office,
   will ensure ORM or other risk management programs or techniques are fully implemented,
   documented in unit lesson plans (LP), and tailored to their specific operation and location for
   all AFECT events.
   5.6.2. The AFE superintendent will develop and publish an Emergency Action Plan (EAP)
   for use during any training event where injury is likely, (e.g., AFE class if signal flares are
   activated). The EAP will be included in the unit LP, briefed by the lead instructor prior to
   each training event, and understood by every instructor and student prior to event start.
5.7. Passenger and Incentive Flyer Training:
5.7. (ACC)Passenger and Incentive Flyer Training. NOTE: For the purpose of this
supplement, passenger and incentive flyer guidance applies to orientation, distinguished visitor,
familiarization, incentive, and spouse orientation flights addressed in AFI 11-401.
   5.7.1. Passengers scheduled for flight aboard ejection seat equipped aircraft will receive, as a
   minimum, emergency egress, PDT, and AFE training no earlier than 72 hours prior to flight.
   If the 72 hours are exceeded before flight, training will be re-accomplished. Emergency
   egress training includes cockpit familiarization, use of oxygen/communication controls and
   switches, and manual bailout procedures training, if applicable.
   5.7.1. (ACC) Aircrew scheduled to fly on aircraft other than their primary airframe are only
   required to perform hands-on training on unique aircraft differences. EXAMPLE: If an F-16
   pilot is scheduled for a sortie on a B-1, F-15, etc. they must perform hands-on egress training.
 68                          AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010

      receive water survival academics and hands on training with life preservers/life rafts.
   5.7.2. Non-rated personnel who fly occasionally to perform official duties (e.g., enroute
   ground support, security, etc.) will receive emergency egress, PDT, and AFE training at
   intervals determined by respective MAJCOM.
      5.7.2.1. (Added-ACC) These individuals, to include members in casual status awaiting
      pilot training, aerospace physiologist, flying maintenance personnel, intelligence
      personnel, and developmental/test engineers may be placed on a 90-day currency after
      meeting the following requirements: Members must first complete egress class as
      applicable to the MDS a minimum of three times during a 90-day period. Member must
      complete all required AFECT. After the above two conditions are met, the FEO will
      evaluate/validate the members proficiency and forward a memorandum to the Operations
      Group commander (or equivalent) recommending the member be placed on a 90-day
      currency for the MDS specific egress training and AFECT. The Operations Group
      commander (or equivalent) is approval authority for the 90-day currency. Not applicable
      to AFRC units.
   5.7.3. Passengers scheduled for flight aboard non-ejection seat equipped aircraft will be
   briefed on emergency procedures and AFE as depicted in appropriate aircraft passenger
   briefing guides. The aircraft commander or their designated representative may conduct this
   briefing.
   5.7.4. (Added-ACC) Refer to AFI 11-401 for taxi ride guidance.
5.8. Training Documentation:
   5.8.1. All completed AFECT events will be documented on AF IMT 1522, ARMS Additional
   Training Accomplishment Report, or equivalent and maintained as a record of class
   attendance IAW AFI 37-139. Only those event identifiers shown in Table 5.1 of this
   instruction will be used to identify AFECT events.
   5.8.2. Upon completion of training, one or more rosters will be signed by the instructor and
   forwarded to appropriate office for input into ARMS. The OSS AFE Flight staff will keep a
   duplicate copy of the rosters on file.
   5.8.3. Instructors will provide written documentation to individuals who are from another
   unit (i.e., Inspector General, HHQs staff, and visiting aircrews) so their records can be
   updated at home station.
   5.8.4. FTU and Basic Fighter Training (BFT) student rosters will be maintained until
   graduation.
   5.8.5. AFE is not responsible for maintaining ARMS or managing and tracking aircrew
   training status for AFECT events in ARMS.
5.9. Training Aids and Equipment:
   5.9.1. Emergency ground and air egress and ejection seat training will be accomplished
   using the appropriate Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) when available or the actual aircraft
   only when an EPT is not available. Non-ejection seat egress training will be conducted using
   actual aircraft to the maximum extent possible.
AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010                                              69


   5.9.2. Units may use the actual aircraft installed ejection seat for egress training when
   designated training devices are not available provided all ejection seats are made safe by
   qualified egress personnel.
   5.9.3. For ACDT and egress training, aircrew members are required to wear all clothing and
   AFE items typically worn during contingency operations unless specifically prohibited by
   this instruction.
   5.9.4. AFECT instructors will inspect training devices and aids prior to use to ensure they
   are properly configured, safe, and operational for training. The AFE superintendent or their
   designated representative will perform annual inspections of all AFE training devices and
   aids to ensure they are current and safe for training use. This includes displays, ACDE, AFE,
   and personnel lowering devices. Inspections will be documented appropriately.
      5.9.4.1. (Added-ACC) Each unit will develop an EPT local inspection checklist
      approved by the FEO. EXCEPTION: Checklist may be approved by AFES in ANG
      units.
      5.9.4.2. (Added-ACC) All EPTs will be inspected prior to use and semi-annually.
      These inspections will be documented on AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission
      Flight Data Document, or equivalent (i.e., ALERTS, AFTO Form 244,
      Industrial/Support Equipment Record).
   5.9.5. Training equipment will mirror operational equipment to the maximum extent
   possible. Equipment used for training will be clearly marked ―FOR TRAINING USE
   ONLY‖ and stored to prevent co-mingling with operational equipment. When training
   equipment does not exist (i.e., night vision devices, combat survival radios, etc.), MAJCOMs
   may designate the use of operational equipment for training as long as the training does not
   damage or destroy the integrity of the equipment.
      5.9.5.1. (Added-ACC) PRC-112 series survival radios, AN/PRQ-7 Combat
      Survivor/Evader Locator (CSEL) and PNVGs may be used for training as long as the
      training does not damage or destroy the integrity of the equipment. For those AFRC
      units that do not have dedicated AERP training assets, operational assets may be used. If
      an operational asset was utilized for training, inspect at intervals IAW governing
      technical orders.
5.10. Lesson Plans Development Guidance:
   5.10.1. AFECT Air Force Master Lesson Plans. AFMLPs are documents developed to
   prescribe instructional requirements, teaching points, and instructor-student activities
   essential to the accomplishment of training objectives for all AFECT. AFMLPs are designed
   to include the minimum training requirements and are essential for supervisors and
   instructors to ensure lesson objectives are completed.
   5.10.2. Only approved AFMLPs developed by the 361 TRS/TRR AFE CDC Writer,
   Sheppard AFB, TX will be used to conduct AFECT. The AFMLPs, developed by the 361
   TRS/TRR, are complete and ready be downloaded once they have been approved by Lead
   MDS MAJCOM. Units should delete information from the AFMLPs that does not pertain to
   their mission or unit. MAJCOMs will use AFMLPs developed by the 361 TRS/TRR.
   Furthermore, ARC units that have AFECTIs who are solely responsible for conducting code
70                          AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010


  of conduct continuation training events will only use lesson plans approved by AFRC/A3TS
  or NGB/A3OS.
  5.10.3. The FEO or AFE superintendent must tailor down the AFMLP and produce an
  AFECT Master Lesson Plan (MLP) to meet their wings mission needs. AFECT MLP are un-
  personalized lesson plans used for control and standardization within an organization or unit
  that has been developed from the AFMLP by deleting unnecessary information based on a
  units equipment or MDS. Group FEO/AFE superintendents who identify a need for a new
  AFMLP will forward request to MAJCOMs or Lead MDS MAJCOM for review of new
  requirement(s). Approved requests will be forwarded, and all data from Subject Matter
  Expert (SME) for development of AFMLP to 361 TRS/TRR AFE CDC Writer, Sheppard
  AFB, TX.
  5.10.4. AFECT LP. Lesson plans are documents developed from the AFECT MLP and
  prepared for use by each instructor to organize and present information. A personalized
  lesson plan contains information to aid the instructor. This is accomplished by writing
  personal instructional notes and material on the right-hand side of the AFECT MLP. The
  lesson plan must be validated with approved reference materials that can be produced upon
  request.
  5.10.5. All AFE MLPs and AFECT LPs used to conduct AFECT will be reviewed annually
  by the group FEO or AFE superintendent. Annual reviews will be documented as directed by
  individual MAJCOMs.
     5.10.5.1. (Added-ACC) Annual reviews will be documented on lesson plan cover page
     and in ALERTS. EXCEPTION: ANG units may use an equivalent program to ALERTS
     for annual review documentation.
 5.10.6. Higher headquarters correspondence (e.g., messages, Flight Crew Information Files
 [FCIF], etc.) directing the inclusion of information not covered in AFECT AFMLPs or lesson
 plans will be added as directed by the 361 TRS/TRR.
  5.10.7. Designated Lead MAJCOM MDS SMEs will assist the 361 TRS/TRR in validating
  AFMLPs biennially during the World Wide AFE Workshop MAJCOM breakouts. If more
  frequent reviews are deemed necessary; the requesting MAJCOM will coordinate and fund
  for the CDC Writer to attend MAJCOM conference to accomplish the review with SMEs.
  The 361 TRS will notify the MAJCOMS of any changes to the AFMLPs and group
  FEO/AFE superintendent will update their MLPs upon notification by their MAJCOMs.

AUTOMATED LIFE-SUSTAINING EQUIPMENT RECORDS & TRACKING SYSTEM
       (ALERTS) AND AIRCREW PROTECTION WEBSITE (APWEB)

6.1. Overview. The ALERTS and APWEB are automated global data management systems
developed to allow ―total asset visibility‖ of AFE items and associated documentation processes.
ALERTS is capable of supporting the entire AFE community to automate the data management
processes for most inspection, training, supply, and administration documents. The vision of
ALERTS is to provide the ability and means of improving the performance methods and
administration needs of the AFE community and support agencies using current COTS hardware,
software, and the military (.mil) network.
6.2. Automated Document and Management Systems:
   6.2.1. ALERTS. Once fully fielded, ALERTS will be used by all AFE functions within the
   Air Force IAW this chapter and MAJCOM supplements thereto. ALERTS Computer Based
   Training (CBT) is a mandatory training requirement prior to any individual using ALERTS
   in all organizations.
       6.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) ALERTS is the designated data management system for use by
       ACC. EXCEPTION: Use of ALERTS in the ANG is optional, unless specifically
       directed by technical order. Not applicable to AFRC units.
   6.2.2. ALSMS. ALSMS is a management tool used by AFE personnel. AFE units are
   authorized to continue using the ALSMS program to best suit their needs until they are
   designated by their MAJCOMS to be upgraded to ALERTS. Units tracking AFE items with
   the ALSMS program are not required to duplicate the data maintained in the computer on
   status boards, shop inspection cards, or forms. AFE superintendents will standardize
   equipment tracking methods within their respective groups.
   6.2.3. Aircrew       Protection    Website      (APWEB)         can     be   accessed     at:
   https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/DOTL/UnitData/UnitDataHomeFrame.cfm. All
   units that are not using ALERTS will use APWEB to document their end item data IAW the
   APWEB user manual. Each unit will provide all relevant data on each item to include;
   contract numbers, lot numbers, dates of manufacture, dates of expiration, back order
   quantities, off-base requisition numbers, and quantities deployed. The data contained within
   this site must be complete, verified, and validated by their respective MAJCOM prior to the
   unit being upgraded to ALERTS.
6.3. Responsibilities:
   6.3.1. Air Force ALERTS Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). HQ AMC is the primary
   OPR for the development, implementation, maintenance, and certification of ALERTS. The

6.4. ALERTS General Areas:
   6.4.1. Requesting Modifications or New Capabilities:
      6.4.1.1. Purpose.     ALERTS serves as the single focal point program in the
      documentation of all AFE processes. To meet the rapidly changing needs of the AFE
      community, the following process will be used to manage requests for modifications and
      new ALERTS capabilities outside of the scope of the current support contract. This
      process is described below.
      6.4.1.2. Changes to Policy/Procedure Documents and or ALERTS Processes.               The
      identifying user will accomplish the following:
      6.4.1.2.1. Provide a written proposal of the complete suggested process to their
      MAJCOM FM.
          6.4.1.2.2. The MAJCOM FM will validate the need and forward the proposed
          process to the Air Force ALERTS OPR.
          6.4.1.2.3. The Air Force ALERTS OPR will forward the proposal to the support
          contractor for evaluation.
          6.4.1.2.4. The support contractor will evaluate the proposed process and determine
          the technical feasibility.
          6.4.1.2.5. If the need is technically feasible, the Air Force ALERTS OPR will
          validate and forward to all using commands for their input. MAJCOM ALERTS
          POCs have 10 working days to evaluate proposals. Negative replies are required. If
          the need applies to only the proposing command, the Air Force ALERTS OPR will
          validate the need and proceed to the next step.
             6.4.1.2.5.1. If all MAJCOMs‘ POCs do not agree, the proposal will be forwarded
             to HQ USAF/A3O-AT for final resolution.
             6.4.1.2.5.2. If all ALERTS MAJCOMs‘ POCs agree, the support contractor will
             determine the cost for development and implementation.
          6.4.1.2.6. Once the technical feasibility and cost analysis are received, the proposal
          will be forwarded to the APWG and APEC for final determination and a funding
          solution.
             6.4.1.2.6.1. If approved and funding has been secured, the Air Force ALERTS
76                             AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010


               OPR will initiate the development and implementation process.
               6.4.1.2.6.2. If disapproved, the submitting command will be notified by the Air
               Force ALERTS OPR and or the APEC of their decision and rationale for
               disapproval.
  6.4.2. Software Problem Report (SPR):
        6.4.2.1. Users will submit SPRs through the established procedures contained in
        APWEB or ALERTS websites. Users should contact their local Work Group Managers
        to validate there is not connectivity problems locally before contacting the help desk or
        submitting an SPR. There are 3 types of SPRs, which are described as follows: NOTE:
        The inability to connect or a slow response from the APWEB or ALERTS servers does
        not constitute a problem with these systems.
            6.4.2.1.1. Category 1. An identified requirement is nonfunctional.
            6.4.2.1.2. Category 2. An identified requirement is nonfunctional, but there is a valid
            work-around to accomplish a required task.
            6.4.2.1.3. Category 3. Administrative or cosmetic only and do not affect the function
            of the programs.
        6.4.2.2. Users will fill out all required information on the SPR submittal form to include
        detailed descriptions of the problem when required.
 6.4.3. AFE Automated Information Technology (AIT) Barcode Marking Standard. All AFE
 units with acquisition authority will refer to their responsibilities paragraphs contained within
 this instruction and Attachment 2 for implementing the AF AFE AIT barcode marking
 standard for AFE supplies.
 6.4.4. Standards.
        6.4.4.1. Nomenclature Standard. To ensure a common standard for nomenclatures
        within ALERTS, units will use the technical order IPBs or manufacturer‘s manuals when
        establishing items. Items or equipment not addressed in IPBs, formal technical orders, or
        manuals will be assigned a nomenclature by 77 AESG or 642 CBSG.
        6.4.4.2. Air Force Kit/Aircraft Configuration Naming Standards. To ensure global data
        reporting capability, units will use the identified standards contained within ALERTS.
        Request additional templates IAW paragraph 6.4.1 of this Instruction.
        6.4.4.3. Item Supply Detail Data. All relevant data on these screens will be tracked by
        all AFE units. If the data is not available units will use the standard established below for
        all unknown data fields.
     6.4.5. Data Entry Standards:
        6.4.5.1. Within APWEB, units attempting to enter data that is unavailable will use
        ―UNK‖ for unknown text fields, and 01/01/1900 for unknown date fields. All unknown
        data fields that are not mandatory will be left blank.
        6.4.5.2. Within ALERTS, all unknown data fields not mandatory will be left blank. For
        mandatory fields, units will use the APWEB standard.
AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010                                               77


      6.4.5.3. All contract number and lot number entries must include the full contract and lot
      number and be entered into ALERTS exactly as they appear on the item. This will
      ensure there is no confusion when data is recalled.
   6.4.6. LOGIN Standard for AFE Personnel and Aircrew. LOGIN standard is case sensitive
   and includes the last name, first initial, and last six numbers of individual‘s SSN. AFE units
   must scan the one-dimensional bar code on the backside of the aircrew‘s military
   identification card for the ALERTS login.
   6.4.7. APWEB and ALERTS Data Protection; For Official Use Only (FOUO):
      6.4.7.1. Reports generated from APWEB/ALERTS will be considered FOUO, unless
      otherwise marked, and must be protected IAW DoD and AF instructions.
      6.4.7.2. Reports containing personnel data, i.e., SSN will have the privacy act statement
      affixed.
      6.4.7.3. Aircraft tail number location in ALERTS must use the last six digits as the
      standard (example: 99-0011). This will allow full integration of the new automated
      forecasting system and the requirements established by 84 MUSG/GJ (OO-ALC) for
      properly tracking and forecasting time change items for replacement.
   6.4.8. Configuration Data File (CDF) Process:
      6.4.8.1. The CDF established for accountable equipment items will be maintained in
      AFEMS IAW AFMAN 23-110. Accountable and non-accountable equipment end item
      authorizations will be documented and maintained in APWEB/ALERTS. Air Staff,
      MAJCOMs, and 77 AESG when experiencing acquisition difficulties, may direct units to
      document authorizations and on-hand quantities within these programs.
6.5. ALERTS Operations Areas:
   6.5.1. Aircraft Accident Data Records. Upon notification from a competent authority, the
   AFE superintendent, squadron system administrator, or AFE NCOIC will freeze all AFE
   records for equipment involved in a mishap. To ensure data fidelity for the safety review
   board, these records will remain frozen until such time as determined by the involved
   MAJCOM Staff Judge Advocate or delegated authority. Once authority has been granted,
   the AFE superintendent will notify the contractor help desk to unfreeze the records.
   6.5.2. Data Review Requirement. AFE superintendents and NCOICs or designated
   individual will review APWEB and ALERTS to validate data accuracy every 180 days.
   6.5.3. CTK Procedures. AFE specialized equipment used on the flightline will be marked
   and managed IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and
   Chapter 3 of this instruction.
   6.5.4. Equipment Accountability. ALERTS specialized equipment will be marked and
   managed IAW AFI 33-112, Computer Systems Management.
   6.5.5. ALERTS Data Record Transfer Process:
      6.5.5.1. Units using ALERTS to transfer equipment, personnel, or aircraft records to
      other ALERTS enabled units will use the ALERTS electronic data transfer process.
78                          AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010


     6.5.5.2. Units using ALERTS to transfer equipment, personnel, or aircraft records to
     non-ALERTS enabled units will still use the ALERTS electronic data transfer process.
     However, the information will be stored under a general identified Personnel Accounting
     System (PAS) code until the receiving unit comes online with ALERTS. The sending
     unit will also provide paper copies of all required forms.
  6.5.6. AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, Process. AFE units with ALERTS fully
  implemented can use ALERTS in lieu of the AF IMT 1297 to transfer responsibility of the
  item. MAJCOMs may implement more restrictive accountability procedures as required.
  6.5.7. Contact Memory Button (CMB) Processes and Mounting. MAJCOMs will develop
  their own implementation process for units using the CMB.
  6.5.8. Interaction with Mobility Inventory Control & Accountability System (MICAS). Air
  Staff or MAJCOM will provide the APWEB or ALERTS data associated with MICAS to
  data managers when requested through these programs.
  6.5.9. Deployment and Multi-Command or Multi-Unit Operations:
     6.5.9.1. Units will use the guidance in the ALERTS user and process manuals for these
     operations. Units who do not have any ALERTS specialized equipment or are not
     connected to the ALERTS site while deployed will refer to paragraph 6.5.10 for
     documentation procedures.
     6.5.9.2. Non-ALERTS units, or units not using CMB, which service multi-place aircraft
     will preposition a copy of all AFE items inspection records on the aircraft prior to all
     deployments.
  6.5.10. Units will develop documentation procedures to update ALERTS data when
  connectivity is not available or if they do not have the necessary hardware to use ALERTS in
  the unconnected mode. This will include all maintenance actions, QA, and any other actions.
  6.5.11. DoD, Air Force and AFTO Forms/IMT, and Other Documentation (NL555, Battery
  Inspection Label) Within the Sections/Shops. Units implementing ALERTS do not have to
  use serviceability tags to identify equipment in service, storage, or otherwise used unless
  specifically required in AFMAN 23-110 or required by Air Force technical orders. Units
  will use condition code tags when turning in equipment to supply IAW AFMAN 23-110.
  MAJCOMs may implement more restrictive accountability procedures to distinguish
  serviceability of equipment as required.
  6.5.12. ALERTS will use a single type of inspection record for all AFE items when
  applicable.
 6.5.13. AF Form 623 (Automated). ALERTS is the primary electronic equivalent authorized
 means to provide the capability to electronically track all AFE technician training.
 MAJCOMS will develop an implementation process for using the electronic ALERTS AF
 Form 623. NOTE: TBA is an authorized AF Form 623 automated electronic equivalent
 alternative for those units that do not have access to ALERTS.
     6.5.13.1. (Added-ACC) ACC units will use the electronic ALERTS AF Form 623,
     Individual Training Record Folder. EXCEPTION: Use of ALERTS in the ANG is
     optional, unless specifically directed by technical order. Not applicable to AFRC units.
AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010                                 79

Operations Group commanders (or equivalent) are authorized to add only T.O. authorized or
MAJCOM approved survival components or increase aircraft equipment configurations provided
the changes are in compliance with AFI 11-301V1. This supplement, applicable T.O.s, and
allowance standards serve as the basis of authorization to obtain equipment required to meet
mission needs.
7.3. (Added-ACC) AFE Section Responsibilities.
      7.3.1. (Added-ACC) List all AFE placed aboard ACC aircraft on AFTO Form 46, Pre-
      positioned Life Support Equipment, as required. Maintain a file of complete AFTO Forms 46
      by tail number for all assigned aircraft. File copies of AFTO forms will be purged each
      quarter. Not applicable to AFRC units.
      7.3.2. (Added-ACC) Shortages noted by the aircraft commander or designated
      representative and recorded on AFTO Form 46 or 781A, are investigated by the AFE section.
      The investigating activity should request assistance in locating shortages from the station
      where the loss was discovered.
   7.3.3. (Added-ACC) When equipment shortages are discovered which have not been
   documented on the AFTO Form 46 or 781A, the AFE section should investigate and take
   action IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property. For audit purposes,
   document all investigative actions taken.
   7.3.4. (Added-ACC) When AFE owned by other units is discovered during the inventory,
   notify the owning unit‘s AFE section, citing type aircraft, tail number, and type and quantity
   of equipment found. Do not retain AFE; forward it to the owning unit by Issue Priority
   Designator 02 (IPD-02). Copies of shipping documents will be forwarded to owning
   organizations.
      7.3.5. (Added-ACC) Requisition and ensure towelettes (70 percent isopropyl alcohol) are
      placed aboard ACC aircraft for the purpose of swabbing out pre-positioned oxygen masks.

   7.4.3. (Added-ACC) Aircraft maintenance personnel will accomplish any task, which
   requires a raft to be attached to or removed from the aircraft in wing wells, cargo
   compartment cradles, silos, or raft launching devices.
7.5. (Added-ACC) Passenger Support Equipment.
   7.5.1. (Added-ACC) The A-A-50652 adult/child (quick-don) LPU is the primary life
   preserver for passengers and will be pre-positioned at each occupied seat on all over-water
   flights. The LPU- 2/P, 10/P can be used by passengers 18 months or older when the
   adult/child LPU is not available.
   7.5.2. (Added-ACC) The LPU-6/P infant cot is required for infants 18 months old and
   under.
   7.5.3. (Added-ACC) Commercially contracted equipment will be maintained IAW the
   conditions of the contract. All other equipment will be maintained IAW the requirements of
   this supplement and the appropriate technical data.
   7.5.4. (Added-ACC) Passenger-carrying aircraft will be equipped with demonstration
   equipment consisting of one adult/child life preserver and one Passenger Oxygen Kit (POK).
   To distinguish this equipment from operational equipment, units will locally manufacture a
   yellow POK bag IAW T.O. 15X5-2-4-1. The demonstration adult/child life preserver will
   have a 12-inch yellow streamer attached to the carrying case. The POK bag and preserver
   carrying case also will be stenciled "For Demonstration Only" in 1/2-inch black lettering.
   This equipment will be stored on the aircraft in a red bag (locally manufactured) large
   enough to hold both the POK and the preserver. The storage bag also will be stenciled "For
   Demonstration Only" and will be located on the aircraft behind the aft portion of the galley
   on the upper seat support bar. NOTE: (Added) Do not install POKs below or on the
   emergency depressurization valve.
   7.5.5. (Added-ACC) Until Emergency Passenger Oxygen Systems (EPOS) are available for
   use, POKs may be used as suitable substitutes. EPOS assemblies will not be stored or used
   in the crew compartment. EPOS and POKs will not be comingled on the same aircraft.
7.6. (Added-ACC) Uploading and Equipping Alert Aircraft.
   7.6.1. (Added-ACC) Rations and water are placed aboard alert aircraft as a source of
   subsistence for aircrews during Emergency War Order (EWO) commitments. Responsibility
   for aircraft installed sustenance rations and water is a shared responsibility among wing
   services, AFE, and the wing war readiness review board IAW AFI 25-101, War Reserve
   Material (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures; HHQ directives, and unit
   Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
   7.6.2. (Added-ACC) In addition to alert commitments, AFE may also be tasked to load
   rations, water, and flash-blindness devices to support generated force sortie aircraft during
   EWO operations and when required by specific OPLANS. Units should establish procedures
   to upload and download these items and ensure availability of an aircraft storage location.
   This capability will be demonstrated during all major IG inspections to the extent necessary
   to demonstrate an operational capability.
   7.6.2. (OFFUTTAFB) For EWO/OPLAN support, procedures are as follows. Flightline
   section personnel will attend the concept brief to learn the generation timeline and which
 82                             AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010


   aircraft are tasked. AFE personnel will coordinate and pick up MREs from the Force
   Support Squadron. AFE will upload each aircraft according to its tasking, and sign off the
   appropriate aircraft forms and maintenance generation checklists at the designated time.
   7.6.3. (Added-ACC) OPLAN 8010 Actions.
         7.6.3.1. (Added-ACC) Units supporting OPLAN 8010 will maintain all capabilities
         required by the plan. If aircraft configuration requires rations and water, a minimum of
         three Meals Ready-to-Eat per crewmember per day and two five-gallon jugs of water will
         be prepositioned.
         7.6.3.2. (Added-ACC) Requirements for sustenance items are shared responsibilities
         among AFE (delivery, uploading, and downloading), operational squadron (quantify
         based on mission requirements), and Services (storage). Representatives from these
         organizations will establish an MOU. The MOU will specify and define responsibilities
         for forecasting, funding, requisitioning, storing, and issuing rations in support of OPLAN
         8010. Responsibilities for sustenance rations and water are contained in AFI 25-101.
   7.6.4. (Added-ACC) Water bulk stored for aircraft configuration during increased stages of
   alert will be inspected annually.
7.7. (Added-ACC) Equipment Issue, Control and Accountability Procedures.
      7.7.1. (Added-ACC) FEOs, AFESs and supervisors must ensure equipment accountability
      is maintained per AFMAN 23-110V2, Part 13, Standard Base Supply Customer’s
      Procedures, and be familiar with the applicable allowance standards. To enhance mission
      effectiveness and reduce excessive handling and damage, AFE will be pre-positioned on the
      aircraft to the maximum extent possible.
   7.7.2. (Added-ACC) Unless otherwise directed by applicable job guides, AFE personnel
   are responsible for the removal and installation of aircraft-installed and pre-positioned AFE.
   AFE will develop procedures to coordinate flight line taskings with flying squadron
   maintenance scheduling. This coordination is required to ensure AFE taskings are included in
   the weekly and monthly maintenance plans and programmed generations. AFE will use the
   Integrated Maintenance Data System to document completion of related flight line tasks.
   7.7.3. (Added-ACC) All aircraft pre-positioned AFE will be annotated on the AFTO Form
   46, Pre-positioned Life Support Equipment. AFES/NCOICs must ensure all applicable
   entries are accurately reflected (exception: unit of assignment and telephone number). The
   AFTO Form 46 will be prepared in duplicate. Maintain the original copy of the form in the
   AFE section for record purposes and maintain the duplicate copy with the aircraft forms or
   attached to the AFE storage container.
   7.7.4. (Added-ACC) AFE personnel are required to complete the AFTO Form 46 and sign
   the issuing agency block when uploading, configuring, or inventorying pre-positioned AFE.
      7.7.5. (Added-ACC) Perform equipment acceptance checks when new or returning aircraft
      arrive on base with installed survival kits and personnel parachutes IAW T.O. 00-20-1.
      7.7.6. (Added-ACC) Post-flight Inspection.
         7.7.6.1. (Added-ACC) Following the final mission of the day or upon return to home
         station, TDY commitments, etc., AFE personnel are responsible for the performance of
AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010                                              83


     Mission Termination Inventories (MTI) ensuring equipment accountability and
     serviceability on each aircraft. In the event that equipment discrepancies are discovered,
     initiate appropriate actions to correct the deficiency prior to the next flight. If AFE is
     suspected of misuse, abuse or shortages exist, the FEO or AFES has responsibility for
     notifying the applicable flying squadron commander for corrective actions. Copies of
     MTIs are maintained by the appropriate AFE section by aircraft tail number until the next
     MTI is accomplished. (Not applicable for ANG and AFRC units). The pre-flight
     inspection will suffice in the event aircraft/aircrew are off-station with no qualified AFE
     support to accomplish MTIs.
  7.7.7. (Added-ACC) When aircraft deploy in excess of 29 days, prepare the AFTO Form
  46 in triplicate. The original copy of the form is retained by the owning AFE section. The
  second copy is placed with the aircraft forms or attached to the AFE storage container. Place
  the third copy in an envelope to accompany the aircraft forms to the TDY location for use by
  the deployed AFE section.
  7.7.8. (Added-ACC) If unique circumstances arise that require the removal of AFE from an
  aircraft at en route stations, the individual removing the equipment will annotate the remarks
  section of the AFTO Form 46 with their name, date equipment was removed, reason for
  removal, and all equipment disposition and destination information.
  7.7.9. (Added-ACC) During aircraft transfers or movement of AFE, communication
  between gaining and losing units is highly encouraged. In the event AFE issues arise that
  cannot be resolved at the unit level, HQ ACC/A3TOA serves as the focal point for aircraft
  transfers, TDYs, depot inputs, or retrievals. AFRC units will coordinate equipment issues
  through NAF and HQ AFRC/A3TS.
     7.7.9.1. (Added-ACC) When AFE is shipped by LOGAIR, Priority 01, as a minimum,
     will be used.
     7.7.9.2. (Added-ACC) Equipment shipped for aircraft depot retrievals will have
     sufficient days remaining at the time of shipment to ensure no impact to flight returning
     home.
     7.7.9.3. (Added-ACC) When aircraft are permanently transferred, inspection records of
     installed AFE will be mailed to the gaining unit AFE section. Minimum equipment
     requirements outlined in Table A7.1. through Table A7.10. of this supplement will be
     transferred to the gaining unit.
  7.7.10. (Added-ACC) Due to the lack of AFE expertise at some aircraft Programmed Depot
  Maintenance (PDM) locations, maintenance and equipment accountability can be provided
  only by the organization owning the aircraft. In order to ensure the highest standard for ACC
  AFE, the following steps will be followed:
     7.7.10.1. (Added-ACC) Upon PDM arrival, AFE will be shipped back to the owning
     unit where CA/CRL accountability will remain throughout the PDM duration.
     7.7.10.2. (Added-ACC) In the event an aircraft transfer occurs while in PDM, both
     equipment custodians (losing and gaining) must maintain close communication among
     themselves and their unit equipment management section (EMS) to ensure the following
     actions are timely and completed accurately:
84                            AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010


            7.7.10.2.1. (Added-ACC) Sixty days prior to aircraft scheduled release from PDM,
            the organization losing the aircraft will take appropriate supply actions to ship
            equipment to the gaining base and transfer accountability.
            7.7.10.2.2. (Added-ACC) The gaining base will ship equipment, using DD Form
            1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, to PDM for installation on
            aircraft. Custodians must retain copies of all paperwork transactions in the event
            equipment is lost or misplaced.
            7.7.10.2.3. (Added-ACC) Upon receipt of the transfer documents, the gaining base
            supply EMS must coordinate with the AFE custodian to ensure the equipment has
            been received and to take appropriate actions to transfer CA/CRL accountability.
            Base supply will take no action to process equipment transfers until the AFE
            custodian verifies receipt of the equipment.
  7.7.11. (Added-ACC) When aircraft are down for Un-programmed Depot Maintenance, the
  owning organization will ensure equipment has a minimum of 45 days remaining on repack
  cycles prior to aircraft departure. Normally, aircraft are expected to return to the originating
  organization, but in the event aircraft are not returned to the originator, equipment custodians
  will initiate appropriate supply action to ensure equipment accountability. Transfer, receipt,
  and accountability procedures are set forth in AFMAN 23-110V2, Part 2, Chapter 15, Asset
  Reporting, Redistribution, and Disposal; and AFI 23-111, Management of Government
  Property in Possession of the Air Force.
     7.7.12. (Added-ACC) AFE used in any aircraft ejection will not be reused. Exception: This
     equipment may be reused for training purposes only and must not be subjected to training
     scenarios where system failure could cause injury to personnel.
        7.7.12.1. (Added-ACC) AFE subjected to a Class A incident not involving an ejection
        may be reused after thorough inspection verifies serviceability.
  7.7.13. (Added-ACC) Pilots are authorized the ―Aggressor Star‖ decal on aircrew helmets
  only while assigned to the 57th Aggressor Training Group (Nellis AFB).
 7.7.14. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) Table 7.1 (Added-Offutt) replaces Table 7.1 (Added ACC).
 This table is for Offutt specific MDS and is corrected information. A waiver is on file until
 ACC/A3TO can incorporate corrected content into an Interim Change to AFI 11-
 301V1_ACC Sup 1.

7.8. (Added-ACC) Survival Kits.
      7.8.1. (Added-ACC) The use of ALSMS/ALERTS computer generated forms are required
      for each survival kit to list inspections, installation date of flares, lot numbers, annual
      disassembly and inspections and any component shortages that may exist. When survival kits
      are deployed TDY in excess of 120 days, the appropriate computer generated form will be
      forwarded to the AFE section at the TDY location.
      7.8.2. (Added-ACC) Critical parts inspections on the CNU-series survival kits will be
      documented in ALSMS/ALERTS on AFTO Form 338CG.
      7.8.3. (Added-ACC) Survival Kits will be inspected IAW the applicable 14S-series
      Technical Orders and will contain the applicable minimal items listed in Table A7.10. of this
      supplement. Operations Group commanders (or equivalent) may authorize, and will
      supplement, this supplement with a minimal requirements list of Air Force approved optional
      items provided weight limits are not violated and containers are not over packed. Local
      Survival Escape, Resistance, and Evasion (SERE) Specialists and AFE personnel should
      recommend optional items, which relate directly to local climatic conditions, terrain flown
      over, or mission requirements. Survival kit components will be standardized within the
      operational group.
         7.8.3.1. (Added-ACC) Future deletions of local requirements may only be made at the
         discretion of the Operations Group commander (or equivalent). Local SERE Specialists
         and AFE personnel should recommend items, which do not relate directly to local
         climatic conditions, terrain flown over, or mission requirements for deletion.
   7.8.4. (Added-ACC) Survival Kits will be configured with the minimum survival
   components required by this supplement prior to inter- or intra-command transfer of aircraft.
   7.8.5. (Added-ACC) The following mandatory survival kit components will be secured to
   the rucksack/auxiliary container as specified in T.O. 14S1-3-51: survival radio, signal flare
   MK-13/MK-124, mirror, distress marker light (strobe light), A/P25S-5A or B signal distress
   foliage penetrator, whistle, and sea dye marker.
   7.8.6. (Added-ACC) Units maintaining CNU-129/P survival kits for B-52 aircraft will
   ensure survival kits are clearly marked with crew position abbreviation (P, CP, EW, G, N, or
   RN) and local control number.
      7.8.7. (Added-ACC) T-38 Aircraft equipped units have the option of using either the CNU-
      129/P survival kit or a parachute spacer kit (PSK) at the discretion of the Operations Group
      commander (or equivalent).
         7.8.7.1. (Added-ACC) The CNU-129/P survival kit will be used on all off station
         training, cross-country and over-water flights.
         7.8.7.2. (Added-ACC) PSKs will be manufactured locally using fabrication instructions
         published in T.O. 14S1-3-51. When used, PSKs will be attached to the parachute harness
         by engaging both ejector snaps and attaching them to the accessory ―D‖ rings of the
         parachute, and the PSK will remain attached to both sides during parachute descent
         and/or emergency ground egress except for tree landings.

    7.8.8. (Added-ACC) Operations Group commanders (or equivalent) will specify in their
    supplement to this supplement the type and configuration of survival kits and vest used.
    Survival kit and vest components will be standardized within the group.
         7.8.8.1. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) AFE will issue a set of three Personnel Recovery Kits
         to each deploying crew, as the mission requires. Personnel Recovery Kits will be
         inspected on a 90 day cycle.
    7.8.9. (Added-ACC) Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detector Kits.
         7.8.9.1. (ACC) Inspect IAW T.O. 11H5-15-1. Each CO detector kit will be marked with
         a local control number. The manufacture date of tubes and kit inspection date will be
         documented on an attached DD Form 1574, Serviceable Tag-Material.

       to Security Forces for pre-embarkation inspection. Weapons will be holstered and stored
       in a locked case when issued to the aircrew. The aircraft commander or designated
       representative will sign for the weapons on an AF Form 1297. Note: Weapons will not
       be left unsecured on the aircraft. The crew members completing the pre-generation for
       EWO/OPLAN operations will ensure the weapons are not left unattended until the
       aircraft is ―cocked‖ and sealed, if the jet is to be unoccupied in an alert status. These
AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010                                            113


      procedures will be followed unless otherwise specified by local directives at deployed
      locations. Note: See AUABI 11-250 for 763 ERS arming requirements.
          8.7.7.1.1. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) For contingency, EWO/OPLAN mobilizations or
          exercises, AFE will transport the weapons from Security Forces to the aircraft being
          generated while at Offutt unless there is a requirement for each aircrew member to be
          individually issued weapons. At other locations, AFE will transport the weapons
          from the armory or authorized storage facility to the aircraft being generated.
          8.7.7.1.2. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) For readiness exercises, AFE will transport the
          weapons to Base X, where they will be issued to the launching crews to demonstrate
          weapons handling for the inspectors and then place in a locked case.
8.8. (Added-ACC) Deployment of Inspection Records.
   8.8.1. (Added-ACC) Establish procedures to ensure AFE records accompany the deployed
   AFE personnel.
8.9. (Added-ACC) Aircrew Chemical Defense.
   8.9.1. (Added-ACC) Establish procedures to ensure deploying aircrew hand-carry at least
   one complete ACDE/AERP ensemble (D-1 ―mini‖ bag).
      8.9.1.1. (Added-ACC) Carefully package ACDE/AERP equipment components to
      prevent damage.
      8.9.1.2. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) Flying squadron deployment managers will send
      deploying crew members‘ names to 55 OSS/AFE Aircrew Deployments mailbox.
      Contingency will notify the deployment managers of any deployers who have not
      inprocessed with AFE, so they may do so at the earliest opportunity. Deployers will be
      issued the entire D bag, review contents with AFE, and then protective case will be
      sealed. Items will be signed for on an AF Form 1297. 55 OSS/OSP can be contacted for
      current Contingency contact information.
      8.9.1.3. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) Upon return of gear, if the seal remains intact and has
      the same serial number as issued AFE will accept this case as complete. If the seal is
      broken AFE will conduct an inventory with the aircrew present before allowing turn-in.
   8.9.2. (Added-ACC) Ensure deployable equipment and trained technicians are available for
   AFE and ACCA operations. Upon arrival at deployed location, AFE will establish contact
   with EOC and emergency management personnel to coordinate plans for ACCA construction
   and operation during increased stages of alert. ACCA operations should be collocated with
   ground-crew CCA stations whenever possible. However, separate the aircrew and ground-
   crew CCA functions by a minimum distance of 50 feet.
   8.9.3. (Added-ACC) Should staffing requirements and mission needs dictate, deployable
   augmentee resources may be trained in shelter operations and ACCA processing; however,
   they will not be trained or assigned in a capacity requiring AFE technical expertise (AFSC
   1P0X1).
   8.9.4. (Added-ACC) Aircrew ACDE/AERP ensemble sizes. AFE units must deploy with
   crew members‘ individual ACDE/AERP ensemble size information to give AFE personnel
   the capability to requisition sized items as necessary for deployed aircrew. Units may
114                        AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010


  develop local procedures to provide crew members their individual size information to have
  on their person while deployed.
  8.9.5. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) E-4B crewmembers do not have ACDE due to their mission.

AIR FORCE STANDARD AFE AUTOMATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (AIT)
                       BARCODE MARKING

Contractors and suppliers for all AFE systems to include subcomponents shall use bar code
nameplates, labels, or direct part markings IAW DoD MIL-STD-130 Change 1, DoD UID
Guide, and this document. Use of an advanced part marking technology like bar codes and 2D
symbols is essential to the AFE community being able to facilitate automated ―removal and
replace‖ features of automated programming and product support/maintenance. Exceptions to
use of machine-readable nameplates will be considered, on a case-by-case basis, in accordance
with practical or good business sense (e.g., part too small for nameplate, part immersed in fuel
tank, etc.). AFE will consider other advanced part marking technology should they become
commercially practicable, driven by DoD requirements, and or advantageous to the government
in the future.

Marking Requirements.

Human Readable Information (HRI) and Machine Readable Information (MRI) are required for
current AIT systems to provide the necessary advances in efficiency. Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and the DoD has mandated the use of Data Matrix
ECC 200 as the standard format for UID MRI markings. Overarching guidance for the construct
and application of Data Matrix markings is contained in MIL-STD-130 and DoD UID Guide
located at www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/UID. Specific examples are given here for manufactures and
suppliers for implementation.

AFE has three different situations that require or can require different markings and they are:

a. UID Serialized Lot Batch; Items controlled with serial numbers and lot numbers
b. UID Serialized Data Stream; Items controlled with serial numbers only
c. Non UID/Non Serialized Lot Batch; Items that do not meet the UID requirement and are not
controlled with serial numbers.

See figures 1 – 6 for specific examples of the labels and data streams.

HRI Marking Requirements. The following HRI data is required (as a minimum):

- Manufacturer‘s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, 5 alpha/numeric characters

- Item Lot Number

           NOTE: The Lot Number MUST be unique within the manufacturer‘s
           CAGE (Lot Numbers cannot be repeated on other part numbers)

- Item Serial Number
 134                          AFI11-301V1_ACCSUP_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 23 APRIL 2010


           NOTE: Air Force contracts typically require 5 digit serial numbers
           (minimum), sequentially assigned, not to be repeated until serial number
           99,999 has been reached

- Item manufacturer‘s Part Number

           NOTE: The weapon system Specification Number does not meet this
           requirement

- Contract Number (CNCT#), 13 alpha/numeric characters

- Date of Manufacture; Year and Day of manufacture in Julian Date format

           NOTE: Markings and/or attachments shall make no reference to item
           installation requirements/procedures or shelf/service lives.

MRI Data Construct.

Data Matrix ECC200 markings shall be developed based on UID Data Construct #2 using Data
Identifiers (DIs) in accordance with MIL-STD-130 and the DoD UID Guide (see Figure 2). To
facilitate durability throughout the scanning life cycle, the largest symbol size, including quiet
zone, shall be fitted within the available marking real estate. The symbol‘s internal module (cell)
sizes shall be no smaller than 0.0075 inch (0.19 mm) and no larger than 0.025 inch (0.64 mm).
Marks shall contain only the data elements identified below:

           NOTE: The parentheses surrounding the Data Identifier are NOT encoded in the 2D
           symbol.

- (17V) Manufacturer‘s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, 5 alpha/numeric
characters.

- (1T) Item production Lot Number, IAW HRI requirement, Maximum 20 alpha/numeric,
including special characters (- or/).

           NOTE: The lot number MUST be unique within the manufacturer‘s CAGE
           (Lot Numbers cannot be repeated on other part numbers)

- (S) Item Serial Number, IAW HRI requirement, Maximum 20 alpha/numeric including special
characters (- or/).

- (1P) Manufacturer‘s Item Part Number, Maximum 20 alpha/numeric including special
characters (- or/).

           NOTE: The weapon system Specification Number does not meet this
           requirement.

                    ACC AFE QUALITY CONTROL (QC) PROGRAM

Note: (Added) Not applicable to AFRC/ANG units. AFRC/ANG will provide separate guidance
and/or an attachment to this AFI supplement with respective AFE QC program
guidance/requirements.
A3.1. (Added-ACC) General. The ACC AFE QC program is a supplement to guidance
previously provided in this AFI. It encompasses most QC activity for the AFE program and
ensures all equipment and vital programs are adequately inspected. This ensures only the highest
quality equipment is provided to each aircrew member. As required, each unit will supplement
these guidelines to develop a viable quality control program that will assess, analyze, and
identify problem areas that may exist. Utilize this program to measure technician competence,
equipment serviceability, and overall program integrity.
   A3.1.1. (Added-ACC) Daily QCIs: NOTE: All required QCIs should be accomplished
   prior to the next flight.
       A3.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) Daily QCIs will be performed on 100% of all
       personnel/recovery/drogue/ cargo/drag deceleration devices, torso harnesses, survival
       kits/vests, night vision devices, JHMCS, AERP mask/blower/intercom, and life
       preservers/rafts. In addition, all helmets will receive a QCI after initial build-up only.
           A3.1.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) At a minimum, the survival kit QCI will include the
           following: component inspection, raft hook up and torque, and kit closure.
       A3.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) AFE items not listed in paragraph A3.1.1.1. will receive a 25%
       daily QCI.
       A3.1.1.3. (Added-ACC) All items received from outside support agencies will receive
       100% QCI. These agencies include, but are not limited to: TMDE, medical supply, and
       munitions.
       A3.1.1.4. (Added-ACC) QCIs will be performed on 100% of all 3-skill level work until
       the individual is task certified.
   A3.1.2. (Added-ACC) The QCI process will also include other functions which require
   assessment on a routine basis. Section NCOICs or assistants will conduct and document
   checks on at least one of the major areas listed below on a weekly basis:
   Explosive locker/munitions program
   PMEL
   CTKs
   Administrative files to include technical orders, etc.
   OJT program, to include task evaluations, etc.
   Supply, to include control and accountability, documentation, supply product reviews, etc.
   Inspection record files
   Storage of equipment

  AFE Aircrew Training and Equipment
  Safety Program
 A3.1.3. (Added-ACC) Documentation of QCI. Upon completion of the inspection, the
 inspector will document QCIs and ensure all pertinent information is gathered. The form
 will include, as a minimum, the following information.
      A3.1.3.1. (Added-ACC) Item/equipment type, local control number, name of item
      inspector, date of QCI, discrepancy (if noted), name of QC inspector, and a suspense date
      for corrective action. Also, include areas for corrective action (EXAMPLE: page and
      paragraph from T.O.), date corrected, and initials of person correcting the discrepancy.
 A3.1.4. (Added-ACC) Section NCOICs or assistants will conduct monthly training
 sessions on negative trends identified from the QCI process. Trend analysis will be reported
 to AFES.
 A3.1.5. (Added-ACC) Classification/Definitions of Discrepancies.
      A3.1.5.1. (Added-ACC) A major finding is defined as a condition that would endanger
      personnel, jeopardize equipment or system reliability, and affect safety of flight or
      warrant discontinuing the process or equipment operation.
      A3.1.5.2. (Added-ACC) A minor finding is defined as an unsatisfactory condition that
      requires repair or correction, but does not endanger personnel, affect safety of flight,
      jeopardize equipment reliability, or warrant discontinuing a process or equipment
      operation. A minor discrepancy is one that will not affect the operation of the equipment
      but causes the equipment from being 100% compliant with current directives.
      A3.1.5.3. (Added-ACC) Units are authorized to track what is known as an
      administrative finding. An administrative finding is a documentation error that was
      overlooked that identifies critical information but has no effect on the operational process
      or use of the item.
