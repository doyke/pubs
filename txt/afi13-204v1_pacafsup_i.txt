                 AIRFIELD OPERATIONS OFFICER DEVELOPMENT

3.1. Airfield Operations (AO) Officers, AFSC 13MX. Are responsible for the overall
direction and management of services provided by ATC and AM personnel. Additionally, AO
officers provide expertise on civil and combat airspace matters. AO officers provide senior
leaders with guidance and recommendations for facility operations, programs, policy, and
personnel actions. They may also serve as operations officers or commanders of operations
support units.
   3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) 13MX officers ensure ATC and AM services meet base mission
   requirements, comply with appropriate standards, gain waiver approval where standards
   cannot justifiably be met, remain aligned with PACAF and HAF operational and strategic
   plans, and report essential indicators to the unit/installation chain of command.
3.2. Commissioning Source. Officers being assigned to the 13M career field are subject to the
same commissioning requirements as other non-rated operations officers.
3.3. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). All officers attend the Airfield Operations Officer

of selection to attend the initial skills training formal course at Keesler AFB, MS.
   3.3.1. Based on prior enlisted ATC/AM certifications and recent proficiency, officers may
   be proficiency advanced through the control tower, Radar Approach Control and AM blocks
   of instruction in accordance with CFM policy.
   3.3.2. All officers, regardless of prior enlisted or officer experience, must complete the
   airfield operations flight commander responsibilities portion of the course.

   13M CFETP.
       3.4.1.1. If a 13M1 is assigned to a tower only or contract AM facility, defer training on
       radar and /or AM until assignment to another location. Deferment of this training does
       not preclude upgrade to 13M3.
          3.4.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Maintain an approach control certification at locations
          with a RAPCON. Maintain a local control certification at all other locations.

       Education and Training Plan (CFETP) and this AFI will be withdrawn for failure to
       obtain a rating IAW AFI 13-204v3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs and
