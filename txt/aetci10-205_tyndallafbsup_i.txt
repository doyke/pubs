SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It clarifies
applicability for AETC units on non-AETC bases; standardizes wing-level ownership and
location guidance for coordination (paragraph 3.8), execution (paragraphs 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 6.1),
and assessment (paragraphs 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3); and updates guidance on exercise evaluation
(paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6), evaluation team member appointment (paragraph 2.7.2.4) and training
(paragraph 2.7.2.1), exercise reporting (paragraph 5.3.1), application for real-world exercise
credit (paragraphs 6.1.4 and 6.2.2), the lessons learned program (paragraph 5.3.2), and frequency
of exercises (paragraphs 6.9 and 6.11.4); and emphasizes principles that enhance ability to
survive and operate (ATSO) in base exercises (paragraphs 6.11.4.1 and 6.11.4.2).

(TYNDALL AFB) List of facilities exempt from evacuation has been expanded. EET training
requirements and the locally approved simulations list have been updated.

                                             Chapter 1

                                     EXERCISE PROGRAM

1.1. Scope. The AETC exercise program exists to enhance readiness and improve AETC
installations’ contingency and crisis responses. It outlines procedures to organize military
exercises and distribute the results the command. Unless prohibited by a higher directive, the
installation commander may delegate personnel to accomplish the tasks in this instruction. AFI
10-204, Readiness Exercises and After-Action Reporting Program, addresses AETC unit
participation in joint and service exercises. AETCI 10-205, combined with other Air Force and
AETC publications (Attachment 1) and corresponding installation publications, is the basis for
all readiness exercises. This instruction does not relieve units (host or tenant) from the obligation
to comply with exercise requirements established by other directives.
     1.1.1. HQ AETC/A3OS chairs the AETC EET Working Group (WG). The EET WG will
     ensure installation objectives support Air Force EET program objectives. Although the
     AETC/A3OS chairs the WG, the entire group will vet installation exercise clarification,
     verification, and validation, and field specialists will address specific areas. The EET WG, as
     the body of subject matter experts is responsible for the following:
        1.1.1.1. Review and approve AETC guidance waivers.
        1.1.1.2. Solicit guidance from appropriate Air Staff points of contact.
        1.1.1.3. Review training issues.
        1.1.1.4. Monitor installation operational plans and exercises.
        1.1.1.5. Review readiness issues, staff assistance visits (SAV), and exercise and
        inspector general (IG) trends.
        1.1.1.6. Provide EET chief training.
     1.1.2. See the AETC EET Community of Practice (CoP) on the Air Force Portal for major
     command (MAJCOM) guidance updates.
     1.1.3. Installation EETs will ensure war and contingency plans address all EM program
     requirements, and will establish installation and unit commander responsibilities according to
     AFI. Installation tenant units will tailor response capabilities to the installation mission and
     threat assessment. The installation commander will ensure units can fulfill their respective
     missions while satisfying the exercise program intent.
1.1. (TYNDALL AFB) SCOPE. This supplement provides the organizational structure of the
325 FW Exercise Evaluation Team (EET). It gives instructions to commanders, Group EET
Reps and EET members on their duties and responsibilities pertaining to the Wing Exercise
Program. It also provides guidance on support requirements of local Operational Readiness
Exercises (ORE).
1.2. Objective. Maximize benefits gained through exercises by enhancing readiness, boosting
combat capability, streamlining procedures, and improving system support.
AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010                                                    7


1.3. Exercise Policy. Installation commanders use the EET to assess an installation’s ability to
perform its war and peacetime contingency missions. Each installation will plan, conduct, and
assess exercises as required by applicable directives.
   1.3.1. The primary purpose of EET exercises is to measure, record, and analyze
   performance, and identify problems and ensure corrective actions are implemented. Although
   the primary emphasis is to identify problems, training is also a large part of every exercise
   scenario. Installation EETs are typically populated by functional experts.
   1.3.2. Each functional area that participates in exercises must provide assistance as required
   by the EET chief (i.e., EET membership, exercise scenario development, evaluator training,
   report preparation).
       1.3.2.1. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) Ensure team members are available to the EET

                                     EVALUATION TEAM

2.1. Scope. The EET is a key element of the AETC exercise program, responsible for planning,
conducting, and assessing all required exercises. It provides commanders, staff, and functional
managers with independent information regarding their ability to respond to crises or
contingencies.
     2.1.1. When two or more units conduct joint exercises, they will coordinate with the EET
     chief to help validate without duplicating requirements.
     2.1.2. Appoint EET chiefs according to AFI 10-2501 and AFI 90-201, Inspector General
     Activities. Installation commanders will determine who will oversee the installation exercise
     program: vice commander (CV), plans and programs (XP), or the IG.
     2.1.2. (TYNDALL AFB) The wing exercise program will fall under XP, the XP Chief is
     responsible for overall program management and budgeting, and will be the lead evaluator.
     The XP Chief is the approval authority for simulation requests during local exercises. Mr.
     Frank LaBroad is designated the 325 FW EET Chief, and will be responsible for planning
     and executing the wing exercise schedule, and ensuring compliance with AETCI 10-205.
     2.1.3. The type of exercise conducted determines which evaluators and functional areas are
     involved. Emergency management (EM) exercises will use evaluators from the
     Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2 functional support areas. (See
     AFI         10-2501,         Attachment        4,       for        guidelines,        and
     https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/AETC_CAT_CoP for more information.)
2.2. EET Membership. Assign highly qualified military or civilian personnel from each
functional area assessed to the EET. Members should have broad expertise in their functional
specialties. Unit leaders should appoint EET members in writing to serve at least a year
following certification. Note: The installation deployment officer or civil engineering readiness
flight chief should not be appointed to the EET.
2.2. (TYNDALL AFB) EET Membership. Assignment to the EET is a wing level additional
duty; it is recommended that EET members not have conflicting additional duties such as: Unit
Deployment Manager, Security Forces Augmentee, or Search and Recovery Team member. To
the maximum extent possible EET members will be assigned at least 60 days prior to the
departure of current team members. EET members should be highly skilled, experienced and
motivated TSgt/Capt or above, or qualified Civilian with a broad range of expertise in their
organization. They must be able to serve for at least 1 year and be releasable to XPE during
exercises. Exceptions to EET member rank/experience level is subject to EET chief approval.
2.3. EET Chief. Responsible for planning and executing the base-level exercise program.
Additional duties include training EET members; developing, scheduling, conducting, and
assessing local exercises; ensuring proper coordination is accomplished between all participating
organizations (including local civilian agencies) and administering the exercise reporting
process.
     2.3.1. While performing EET duties, the EET chief is directly responsible to the installation
     commander. The EET chief will supplement this instruction. As a minimum, the supplement
AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010                                                      9


   should include a list of locally authorized simulations and exercise ground rules unique to the
   installation, and a list of facilities exempt from total evacuation during exercises (such as
   facilities directly associated with flying training operations, C4 systems facilities, law
   enforcement and fire protection facilities, schools and childcare facilities, medical and dental
   facilities, and recreation, exchange, and commissary facilities). Individuals participating in
   specific activities (military court proceedings, chapel services, promotion testing, etc.) may
   also be exempt from exercise participation and local EET training requirements.
   2.3.2. Email HQ AETC/A3O as soon as possible to report any EET chief change.
   2.3.3. Brief exercise trends and/or significant findings at installation emergency management
   working group meetings.
   2.3.4. Manage the EET publications account. As a minimum, maintain or have access to the
   publications and applicable supplements listed in Attachment 1, as well as the installation
   deployment plan, security plan, base contingency response plan (CEMP 10-2), antihijacking
   plan, war and mobilization plan (WMP), and AETC WMP, Volume III,
   Mobility/Deployment; and Volume IV, General War.
2.4. EET Munitions Account. The EET chief should be familiar with the process to forecast
practice munitions according to AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management.
Note: AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1, Ground Munitions, outlines munitions available for EET use.
   2.4.1. EET chiefs should work with installation munitions accountability systems officers
   (MASO) to schedule practice ground munitions. The MASO will report the installation
   munitions request to HQ AETC/A4/7. For operations continuity, maintain expenditure data
   for at least three fiscal years.
2.5. EET Evaluators. Unit functional representatives (the EET will include at least one
representative from each installation unit). For each exercise, the EET chief will determine how
many functional areas will be involved and how many evaluators will be required (including
contractor members when first-responder contracts are in place).
   2.5.1. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) Each 325 FW Group will designate, in writing, two of
   their (MSgt or Capt min) EET members to act as a primary and alternate Group EET
   Representative. 325 FW/XPE will act as the Group EET Rep for all other 325 FW Staff
   agencies and associate units.
   2.5.2. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) The Group EET Reps will:
       2.5.2.1. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) Group reps will provide group objectives and
       exercise requirements to assist the EET Chief in exercise planning and development.
       Work directly with the EET Chief during exercise planning, coordination, execution, and
       reporting. Debrief exercise participants and squadron commanders following a wing
       exercise.
       2.5.2.2. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) Ensure EET rosters are updated annually, (IAW
       Attachment 2, this supplement), and approved by their group commander, and
       forwarded to the EET Chief.
       2.5.2.3. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) Make their Group EET members' assignments for
       each exercise and monitor their effectiveness and adherence to standards.

AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010                                                       11


       2.5.3.10. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) EET Organizational Chart for Tyndall AFB: (see
       Attachment 1, this supplement)
       2.5.3.11. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) EET training will be conducted IAW Attachment
       2, this supplement.
2.6. Trusted Agents. Subject matter experts (SMEs) who provide exercise scenario input,
create implementers, and help develop exercises. Trusted agents may serve as controllers, and
may initiate exercise events, but will not evaluate exercises. Brief trusted agents on the
importance of protecting MAJCOM and installation exercise information. Document trusted
agent briefings.
2.7. Training. The EET chief will identify and document EET training requirements.
   2.7.1. Following appointment, the EET chief (and deputy chief, if appointed) may attend the
   Air Force Incident Management Course, if space is available. The HQ AETC Civil Engineer
   Emergency Management Branch controls course training quotas (AFI 10-2501, Table 6.1).
       2.7.1.1. EET chiefs may attend the U.S. Air Force Inspection School. HQ AETC/IG
       controls quotas.
       2.7.1.2. Installations are responsible for funding the courses.
   2.7.2. The EET chief will work with the installation Emergency Management Branch to
   conduct EET member initial and refresher training for EET-specific subjects (local policies,
   exercise planning, execution, evaluation), as required.
       2.7.2.1. EET members will complete initial training in the Advanced Distributed
       Learning System (ADLS) at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil, under Emergency
       Management. Training must be complete within 60 calendar days of appointment.
       2.7.2.2. Additional training requirements, as directed by the installation, will depend on
       each member’s functional expertise, and which exercises they will assess.
       2.7.2.3. EET members assigned to assess Air Force incident management exercises will
       receive training in accordance with AFI 10-2501 and AFMAN 32-4004, Emergency
       Response Operations.
       2.7.2.4. Readiness evaluators must be able to use the logistics module (LOGMOD) stand
       alone (LSA) as the backup deployment system, in the event LOGMOD is unavailable or
       network limitations prevent its use. (See AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and
       Execution.) Readiness evaluators will review the installation deployment plan to
       determine how LSA will be used as a back-up system during contingencies and
       inspections. Additionally, readiness evaluators will work with the installation deployment
       officer to arrange initial LSA training, which is required prior to facilitating/evaluating an
       exercise.
       2.7.2.5. The base antihijacking office of primary responsibility (OPR) will establish a
       training program to qualify EET members to assess antihijacking exercises, in accordance
       with AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) (FOUO). Also
       follow guidance in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Joint Order 7610.4, Special
       Operations Chapter 6, Emergency Security Control of Air Traffic.

                                  EXERCISE PLANNING

3.1. Scope. Design exercises that sufficiently challenge overall installation capabilities and
emphasize local plans and procedures. Include specific local restrictions and simulation
procedures in installation exercise ground rules.
   3.1.1. Follow exercise guidelines and criteria according to all applicable Air Force guidance.
   3.1.2. Ensure exercises do not bring unfavorable publicity to the Air Force.
   3.1.3. The installation commander will determine to what extent, if any, that training will be
   interrupted.
3.2. Design and Development. Planning encompasses all aspects of design and development.
Selected EET members will work together to develop exercises for the installation exercise
program office. Individual members will contribute their functional expertise.
   3.2.1. The EET chief will coordinate with the medical unit to ensure an exercise requiring
   medical involvement does not conflict with scheduled accreditation surveys or a health
   services inspection.
   3.2.2. Check host and associate unit flying and maintenance schedules to prevent conflicts.
   3.2.3. Designate trusted agents to help develop exercises. Trusted agents will become part of
   the EET and normally contribute specific expertise to develop key aspects of an exercise.
   3.2.4. Include occupational risk management procedures experts and safety personnel in
   exercise planning.
   3.2.5. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) 325 FW generated exercises will be designated ―CROWN
   ROYAL‖ XX-XX, scenario based and follow a logical progression to the maximum extent
   practical; however, exercises may include evaluations not logically related to meet annual
   requirements or readdress areas needing improvement.
   3.2.6. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) Exercises will be consecutively numbered for each
   exercise within the calendar year, e.g., CROWN ROYAL 10-01 would be the first exercise
   of the CY10.
   3.2.7. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) EXERCISE PLANNING CYCLE
 14                              AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010




3.3. Security. Security is integral to exercise planning. All aspects of EET exercises should be
held in strict confidence. Some installation units need to know (medical, security forces, etc)
some exercise information. Release that information only, with the understanding that
AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010                                                    15


information compromise may cause ―false starts‖ and prevent true evaluation of an installation’s
response capability. EET chiefs should terminate an exercise if a significant compromise occurs.
3.4. Objectives:
   3.4.1. The EET chief will work with senior installation leaders to establish exercise
   objectives, in order to identify or correct problem areas and increase installation agency
   proficiency.
   3.4.2. Review MAJCOM special interest items, requirements in instructions and plans, past
   exercise reports, reports of corrective action, and operational readiness inspection (ORI)
   reports to develop objectives.
3.5. Master Scenario Events List (MSEL):
   3.5.1. A compilation of EET scripted events, depicting activities requiring participant action,
   that will be injected during the exercise. The EET develops the MSEL and participating
   agencies suggest events for inclusion.
   3.5.2. The EET will create at least one MSEL event for each objective, determine how to
   introduce the event, and determine who would most logically cause or report the event. An
   EET designated representative will be the injector. List MSEL events by the injection date-
   time group.
3.6. Implementers. Written, detailed exercise inputs made at planned times to a specific
function or individual to support a specific MSEL item. Prepare implementers to trigger MSEL
events.
   3.6.1. In an aircraft crash scenario exercise, an implementer might be simulated radio
   communications with air traffic control (ATC) agencies describing the simulated crash to the
   control tower crew. (Example: ―You see AMC 12345, a C-141, dive into the ground 1 mile
   from the approach end of runway 32 and burst into flames. Take appropriate action.‖)
   3.6.2. Implementers might also portray a situation at a simulated accident site (smoke
   munitions, weapons shapes, moulaged casualties, mannequins, aircraft parts, etc.).
   Implementers are the key devices for exercise control and should contribute realism to an
   exercise.
3.7. Munitions. List in the exercise scenario all smoke-generating devices or ground-burst
simulators planned for use during an exercise. If explosives are used during an exercise, the EET
chief will prepare an inventory of devices to be used and a risk assessment, and will coordinate
with wing safety prior to use. The installation commander must approve the use of training
munitions, in accordance with AFMAN 91-201.
3.8. Coordination. The EET chief will coordinate with the base contracting office before
conducting any exercise that will delay or disrupt contract employees’ work.
   3.8.1. For exercises that may involve fire protection agencies, coordinate the exercise time
   (not the details) with the fire chief at least 30 minutes before the exercise.
   3.8.2. Brief the airfield operations flight commander at least 48 hours in advance of an
   exercise that will involve an ATC facility or airport movement area. The airfield operations
   flight commander must approve, in advance, exercises that move controllers to alternate
   facilities or shelter areas.
 16                               AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010


   3.8.3. Coordinate off-base exercises with local civil authorities/emergency planning
   committee (local governing authorities, fire department, police, sheriff, etc.). All off-base
   exercises must be coordinated through the base legal office and approved by the installation
   commander.
   3.8.4. Medical EET representatives will coordinate exercise objectives with the medical
   readiness office to ensure scenarios include events that allow completion of requirements in
   AFI 41-106, Unit Level Management of Medical Readiness, and will coordinate exercise
   scenarios and timing with the medical treatment facility (MTF) commander to help minimize
   disruption of health services delivery.
   3.8.5. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) 325 FW Public Affairs (PA) will release exercise
   information to local media and base residents when appropriate to eliminate confusion with
   real world events. As outlined in AFI 35-206, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures, PA
   will provide exercise news, public releases, and coverage in the Gulf Defender and base
   information television channel when appropriate. PA will escort all news media
   representatives. All public statements will be coordinated through PA prior to dissemination.
   3.8.6. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) The exercise liability period and scope may be
   established with an exercise "Special Instruction" (SPIN). Exercise inputs may be through
   the Command Post (CP), or other means. The Crisis Action Team (CAT) will be the primary
   focal point for exercise actions.
3.9. Approval. The EET chief will obtain installation commander approval before establishing
or conducting an exercise. The commander will determine appropriate levels of participation for
personnel directly involved in training operations to ensure exercises are as effective as possible
without negative impact on the primary training mission.
3.10. Pre-Exercise Briefing. The EET chief will conduct a pre-exercise briefing for EET
members. EET members will not disclose briefing information to parties who do not have a need
to know. Briefing topics should include exercise scenario, date, time, and location; event timing;
agencies to be assessed; situation cards and props for use in the exercise; safety considerations;
exercise debrief time and location; and exercise communications.
AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010                                                      17

                                   EXERCISE EXECUTION

4.1. Scenario. Execute the exercise scenario on the date and time planned or as modified by the
EET chief. Once an exercise begins, it continues until all objectives have been met and, with the
EET chief’s recommendation, the installation commander terminates. Ideally, the scenario
should proceed to a logical end point. However, the EET chief or installation commander may
terminate the exercise early in the event safety concerns or conflicting real-world emergencies
arise, or when all exercise objectives are met.
4.2. Control. EET members monitor MSEL status during the exercise and inject implementers
to direct the pace. Participants may act to negate a planned event, or require an ―ad hoc‖ event, to
keep the exercise on track. The EET chief coordinates among all controllers and adjusts MSEL
activity to meet exercise objectives. EET members ensure the exercise does not expand beyond
its planned scope.
4.3. Data Collection. EET members collect data on exercise participant actions, significant
exercise events, and other information required for after-action reports and debriefings.
   4.3.1. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) In an effort to validate facts and sources, EET members
   may address potential findings/observations with the inspectee. In addition, this will give
   him/her a chance to explain or rebut the finding/observation and give the EET member a
   chance to educate the inspectee on proper procedures.
   4.3.2. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) DO NOT discuss ratings or use rating words
   (unsatisfactory, marginal, satisfactory, excellent, and outstanding) during your out-
   briefings/validations. The overall rating will not be determined until the report is approved
   by 325 FW/XP. You can say that an area looks good or that it needs some work, but try to
   leave on a positive note.

                              EXERCISE DATA ASSESSMENT

5.1. Assessment Documents:
   5.1.1. After an exercise, the EET will assess data collected to determine if exercise
   objectives were met. Focus on exercise objectives, document results, complete a trend
   analysis (if requested by the installation commander), and provide feedback to participants.
   5.1.2. The EET chief will provide a debriefing, critique, and report for each exercise.
   Exercise grading is not required. However, if it is used, follow criteria in AFI 90-201.
5.2. Debriefings. After the exercise, the EET and trusted agents convene in a closed session to
review and assess the exercise. This initial debriefing is closed to other exercise participants to
enable evaluators and EET members to freely discuss the exercise. All findings and
recommended improvement areas will be validated with exercise participants after the EET
closed session.
   5.2.1. After the exercise, the EET chief will critique the exercise with the installation
   commander before the open session to debrief exercise participants.
   5.2.2. The EET chief will debrief participants as soon as possible; no later than 30 days after
   the exercise. The debriefing should include working level personnel when possible. The
   objective of the debriefing is to develop common dialogue between EET members and
   exercise participants.
5.3. Afteraction Report. The EET chief will prepare a formal afteraction report (AAR) for
each exercise credited toward requirements in AFI 10-2501, Table 7.1. Reports may be prepared
for other exercises conducted, but are not required. The installation commander will approve the
final report. Note: Reports required by this instruction are operating documents and thus exempt
from reports control symbol licensing requirements, according to AFI 33-324, The Information
Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency
Air Force Information Collections.
   5.3.1. EET members will contribute to the report, and the EET chief (or designated
   representative) will consolidate inputs and produce the final report. Forward problems
   identified in the final report that the installation requires AETC to resolve. The EET chief
   will assign an OPR for each finding, and will validate all findings before publishing the
   report. In addition, the EET chief will prepare a cover memorandum that includes an exercise
   summary and its overall ratings (if used).
   5.3.2. Lessons learned should detail specific problems and resolutions or innovative
   approaches. Omit specific names, locations, or other information that identifies people or
   units. Each lesson learned should describe a problem encountered and solved (or not solved),
   and/or successful actions that can be used during future operations or exercises. Document
   lessons learned using the after action reporting lessons learned document template on the
   AETC EET CoP.

each evaluated area IAW AFI 90-201 and AETC Supplement 1, Inspector General Activities.
5.4. Corrective Actions. The EET recommends revised procedures to higher headquarters
based on exercise results. Do not consider discrepancies identified in after-action reports
corrected until corrective action is completed, approved by the commander or designated
representative, and validated by another exercise or test of the applicable procedure.
   5.4.1. EET Chief Responsibilities:
      5.4.1.1. Review corrective actions and identify recurring or common deficiencies (trend
      analysis).
      5.4.1.2. Track corrective actions and suspenses for follow-up actions.
      5.4.1.3. Ensure corrective actions are appropriate and correctly address problem root
      causes.
      5.4.1.4. Identify inaction and incomplete corrective actions that could not be resolved at
      a lower level to the group or wing commander (as applicable) for resolution.
      5.4.1.5. Maintain a corrective actions record for at least two years.
      5.4.1.6. Validate corrective actions during subsequent exercises.
   5.4.2. Installation Functional Manager Responsibilities. Correct discrepancies identified
   in the afteraction report, and provide a written response to the EET chief by the established

                                           Chapter 6

                               EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Minimum Exercise Requirements:
   6.1.1. See AFI 10-2501, Table 7.1, for each exercise type minimum frequency. AETC
   installations may include a nuclear weapons exercise if the installation commander chooses.
   6.1.2. Complex exercise scenarios may include several individual exercises (major accident
   response, natural disaster response, etc.) in one large exercise. Each exercise may be credited
   against multiple exercise requirements if criteria for each exercise are assessed.
   6.1.3. Participation during IG inspections or other higher headquarters-directed activities
   (such as command post exercises and SAVs) that encompass a multifunctional cross-section
   of installation personnel may be credited toward overall exercise requirements. An AAR is
   required for credit.
   6.1.4. Real-world contingencies may be credited toward overall exercise requirements if the
   installation commander determines the contingency satisfies requirements.
6.2. Major Accident Response Exercise (MARE). Involves DoD material or activities of such
magnitude that the base disaster response force is required.
   6.2.1. A MARE may involve one or more of the following:
      6.2.1.1. Hazardous substances such as radioactive materials, toxic industrial chemicals,
      explosives, and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high yield explosives
      (CBRNE).
      6.2.1.2. Class A mishap.
      6.2.1.3. Extensive property damage.
      6.2.1.4. Grave risk of injury or death.
      6.2.1.5. Adverse public reaction.
   6.2.2. When conducting a MARE, include at least one (or combine several) of the following
   in the scenario:
      6.2.2.1. Conventional munitions (any nonnuclear, nonbiological, or nonchemical
      munitions).
      6.2.2.2. Chemical weapons or agents, but only if the installation stores, ships, or employs
      chemical agents or munitions.
      6.2.2.3. Hazardous material (HAZMAT).
      6.2.2.4. Radioactive material, if the installation is an Air Force fixed nuclear facility (See
      Attachment 1, Terms.)
      6.2.2.5. Nuclear weapons, if applicable. (See Attachment 1, Terms,)
      6.2.2.6. Off-base response.
      6.2.2.7. Mass casualties. (See Attachment 1, Terms.)
AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010                                                     21


       6.2.2.8. Start time that is before or after normal duty hours.
6.3. Natural Disaster Response Exercise. Assesses an installation’s ability to respond to
natural disasters likely to strike its geographic area. Natural disasters include hurricanes,
tornadoes, storms, floods, high water, wind-driven water, tidal surge, tsunamis, earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, landslides, mudslides, severe snowstorms, drought, and other catastrophes
not caused by humans.
6.4. Terrorist use of Chemical, Biological, and Nuclear High Yield Explosives
(CBRNE). See AFI 10-2501, Table 7.1, for exercise frequency.
6.5. Operational Readiness Exercise. AETC installations conduct as prescribed in AFI 10-
2501, Table 7.1. The exercise should closely resemble the type of attack most likely to occur at
the installation (terrorist, chemical, etc.).
6.6. Deployment Exercise. Assesses an installation’s ability to effectively deploy unit type
codes in support of actual or notional war plans. Two per AEF cycle are required, according to
AFI 10-403, and its AETC supplement.
6.7. Antiterrorism Exercise. Conduct according to AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiterrorism
Standards, and its AETC supplement, and AFI 31-101, Volume 1, Air Force Installation
Security Program. The base threat working group will help develop comprehensive exercise
scenarios.
6.8. Severe Weather Response. Conduct periodically; tailor to upcoming seasonal weather
concerns, in accordance with AFI 10-229, Responding to Severe Weather Events.
6.9. Hijacking Prevention and Resistance Exercise. Exercise the installation antihijacking
plan at least annually. Follow guidance in FAA JO 7610.4. Focus on aircraft most susceptible to
hijacking. Installations without flying operations are exempt.
6.10. Medical Readiness Exercise. AFI 41-106 prescribes numerous medical readiness
exercise requirements for medical units. The EET does not specifically assess each medical
exercise, but the installation EET chief should make every effort to coordinate with the medical
EET chief to include medical exercise requirements in EET exercises. This increases realism and
reduces duplication of effort.
   6.10.1. Emergency Health Powers on Air Force Installations. As required by AFI 10-
   2603, Emergency Health Powers on Air Force Installations, the installation commander will
   organize, train, equip, and exercise personnel to conduct and sustain CBRN operations (see
   10-2501). Use every Airman as a sensor to form an effective integrated base defense
   program. The installation commander will include a public health emergency as one of an
   installation’s major exercises (i.e., mass casualty, CBRN, or biological incident) at least once
   every two years.
   6.10.2. Disease Containment Planning (DCP). When exercising disease containment,
   include mass immunization and disease containment strategies, according to Air Force and
   MAJCOM guidance. Ensure installation personnel, including tenant and geographically
   separated unit members, are trained on and prepared to execute the installation DCP.
6.11. Other Exercises. Other exercises and scenarios do not specifically require evaluation by
the EET, but may be included in EET-conducted exercises.
22                              AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010


  6.11.1. Recall. Test the base personnel recall process to ensure the commander is able to
  rapidly communicate with base personnel. Recall frequency is at the discretion of the
  installation commander.
  6.11.2. Antirobbery and Structural Fire Exercises. Security forces and the fire
  department regularly conduct anti-robbery and structural fire scenarios, which may be
  included in EET-assessed exercises.
  6.11.3. Ability to Survive and Operate (ATSO) Exercises. Unit and individual ATSO
  during emergencies or deployments are crucial to installation functions and missions.
  Conduct ATSO exercises at least twice annually. Run scenarios that test installation abilities
  to perform missions under emergency conditions, and Airmen abilities to establish and
  maintain defensive postures, administer self-aid and buddy care first aid, and operate
  effectively in emergency conditions. Scenarios may be part of a standalone ATSO exercise or
  embedded in any of the exercise categories in AFI 10-2501, Table 7.1.
  6.11.3. (TYNDALL AFB) Ability to Survive and Operate (ATSO) Exercise. Ability To
  Survive and Operate (ATSO) evaluations will primarily involve personnel and equipment
  identified in AFI 90-201/AETC Supplement 1, Inspector General Activities. Tasked
  personnel and equipment will normally be evaluated within the Tyndall AFB cantonment
  area.
     6.11.3.1. See AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, for general, core ATSO skills. In
     addition, see AFI 10-403 for quick reaction checklists that may be useful when
     conducting ATSO exercises.
     6.11.3.2. Prepare AARs to report on standalone ATSO exercises. If ATSO scenarios are
     embedded in other types of exercises, report the results as part of the main exercise AAR.
     6.11.3.3. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) ATSO                execution    and   procedures    are   in
     Attachment 3, this supplement.
  6.11.4. Reception Exercise. Reception exercises assess an installation’s ability to
  effectively receive forces, and facilitate decisionmaking processes for successfully mission
  sustainment, as defined in Chapter 6 of the installation in-garrison expeditionary site plan,
  Part 1.
AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010                                                   23

                                EXERCISE SIMULATIONS

7.1. Simulations. Determined by local policies, contracts, and governing instructions. Rules
should allow periodic testing of all but the most sensitive procedures (such as the actual use of
narcotics). Follow guidance in AFI 10-2501. Include a list of locally approved simulations in the
installation supplement to this instruction. The installation commander will approve, in writing,
other simulations requested during an exercise. Simulation should not prevent exercise of a
function or procedure.
   7.1.1. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) Organizations, which have valid requirements for, unit
   exercise simulations (full/partial, personnel and/or equipment) will respond by letter, using
   format shown in Attachment 5 this supplement, with complete justification. This should
   include identification of real world tasking, regulation numbers, chapter and paragraph
   prohibiting the activity, or unit impact as appropriate. All requests for simulations must be
   coordinated through the respective group commander, and approved by the XP chief in
   writing before a unit can consider them valid.
   7.1.2. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) The pre-approved simulations listed in Paragraph
   A9.3.18.5 and A9.3.21.1 of AFI 90-201/AETC Supplement 1, Inspector General Activities,
   apply during local exercises. In addition, the simulations listed in Attachment 6 are pre-
   approved for local exercises.
7.1. (TYNDALL AFB) Simulations. The 325 FW/XP chief is the approval authority for all
exercise simulations.

observed, EET members and/or exercise participants must take immediate action to prevent
personal injury, damage to equipment, or release of classified information.
AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010                                                        25


   8.2.1. If an actual accident occurs or a person is injured during an exercise, any EET
   member may delay or terminate the entire exercise and give necessary aid. Preface any radio
   or telephone transmission with ―This is a real-world emergency.‖
   8.2.2. If an actual emergency develops while an exercise is in progress, the EET chief,
   incident commander, or installation commander may delay or terminate the exercise as
   necessary.
   8.2.3. Watch supervisors and senior controllers may interrupt or discontinue ATC facility
   participation in any exercise if flight safety is in question, or an exercise interferes with
   recovery of emergency aircraft.
8.3. Personnel Recall. Do not recall people from leave or temporary duty. Do not use
simulations to overcome personnel shortfalls except for individuals who would normally be
recalled. (Example: Personnel on leave or TDY who could be recalled and would arrive in time
to participate.)
8.4. Base Evacuation. Simulate base evacuation.
8.5. Building Evacuation. In the installation supplement to this instruction, include a list of
facilities exempt from total evacuation during exercises. Restrict the facilities to essential
personnel and people who have legitimate business within a facility. Personnel conducting
business when an evacuation is directed may conclude their business, but must remain in the
facility until the evacuation portion of the exercise is complete. Check evacuation plans for these
facilities and question assigned personnel to make sure they know how to evacuate during an
exercise.
   8.5.1. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) 325 FW: Wing Operations Center, military court
   facilities, Conference Center, and religious services.
   8.5.2. (Added-TYNDALL AFB) 325 OG: Base Operations dispatch desk, Operations

   protective equipment during exercises.
8.8. Shelter Operations. Accomplish shelter operations as completely as possible according to
the threat, prudent cost benefit, and logistics limits.
8.9. Medical Personnel. During any exercise, the MTF commander may withhold or withdraw
medical personnel if required to respond to an actual medical emergency. With the installation
commander’s approval, the MTF commander may also withhold or withdraw medical personnel
to avoid adversely affecting scheduled patient care.
8.10. Air Force Civilians. Emergency essential Air Force civilians may participate as specified
in AFI 36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Workforce, and at the discretion of the installation
commander. Approval of civilian overtime is at the installation commander’s discretion.
8.11. Contractors. Contractors who do not have contingency or readiness requirements are
exempt from exercise participation. Contractor personnel will still obey the lawful orders of
responding forces.
   8.11.1. Do not exercise functions being performed under contract unless the exercise
   requirements are established in the contract. When contracted services could affect exercise
   outcome, make sure assessments explain the need for these services, by contract or
   otherwise, during crises. Contact the contracting officer technical representative and
   installation contracting squadron to revise the contract, if necessary.
   8.11.2. Report performance or contract deficiencies simultaneously to the contract
   administrator, quality assurance evaluator, and contractor. If exercise scenarios will incur
   costs beyond those required in the contract, inform the contracting officer immediately to
   determine a course of action.
8.12. Emergency Vehicles. Fire vehicles must follow guidance in AFI 32-2001, Fire
Emergency Services Program.

Firefighting Guidance (U), when communicating during nuclear weapon accident scenarios.
8.15. Requests for Support or Coordination. Unless tasking instructions direct otherwise,
during an exercise, send requests for support or coordination that which would normally go to
higher headquarters or off-base agencies to the EET for resolution.
AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010                                                     27


8.16. Traffic Control. When responding to exercise situations, vehicle operators must abide by
posted speed limits and traffic control devices.
8.16. (TYNDALL AFB) Traffic Control. When exercise objectives seek to demonstrate base
capability to handle Highway 98 traffic delays caused by emergency events, the EET Chief will
ensure any such delay is the minimum necessary to demonstrate that capability, and normal
traffic flow resumes as soon as possible.
8.17. Rental and Purchase of Equipment. During an exercise, prepare the paperwork for
vehicles, equipment, or supplies that would be rented or purchased in a real world situation, but
do not process it. The EET should gather the paperwork to simulate passing to higher
headquarters.
8.18. EET Perpetrator Actions:
   8.18.1. Safety is paramount during exercises. EET perpetrators will obey all orders from
   responding security forces.
   8.18.2. EET perpetrators may attempt to passively evade or hide from exercise participants,
   but they must comply with orders upon detection. Perpetrators may not attempt to flee,
   struggle against, or otherwise try to escape the response force.
   8.18.3. Perpetrators may remove outward items that identify them as EET members.
   However, they will carry identification to prove they are EET members if identification is
   requested.
   8.18.4. Use of actual weapons or blank ammunition is prohibited.
   8.18.5. Perpetrators will not openly display a weapon, or simulated weapon, or use it in a
   threatening manner. (Note: A simulated weapon is anything that looks like a real weapon
   (toy guns and knives, air guns, etc.).) Simulated weapons will only be used to assess the
   thoroughness of a body search. Simulated weapons will be painted or otherwise altered to
   change the authentic appearance and color. Mark simulated weapons as ―training aids.‖
   8.18.6. Perpetrators will not make any threatening action toward responding forces.
8.19. Additional Medical Personnel Deployment Guidelines. EET will ensure the MTF has
at least 60 days notification prior to an exercise in order to minimize impact on patient access to
care. The medical EET member will provide the MTF commander with relevant exercise dates to
enable the facility to adjust patient appointments in a timely, appropriate manner.

Terms
Associate Unit—An Air Force, AFRC, or ANG organization or element that occupies the
facilities of, or receives support from, another MAJCOM, AFRC, or ANG component.
C4 Systems Facilities—Facilities that house command, control, communications, and computer
(C4) systems critical to the installation’s mission or operation. Examples include automated data
processing systems, communications systems, base-wide local area network systems, and
navigational aids, as well as utilities critical to operating these facilities.
Class A (Mishap)—A mishap resulting in one or more of the following: 1) Reportable damage
of $1 million or more; 2) A fatality or permanent total disability [due to injury or occupational
illness, e.g., medical discharge, separation, or nonmedically induced comatose]; 3) Destruction
of an Air Force aircraft, spacecraft, or missile during launch. Aircraft will be considered
destroyed when the man-hours required to repair the aircraft exceed the maximum stated in the
"major repair man-hours" column of TO 1-1-638, Repair and Disposal of Aerospace Vehicles.
Communications Security (COMSEC)—(DoD) The protection resulting from all measures
designed to deny unauthorized persons information of value that might be derived from the
possession and study of telecommunications, or to mislead unauthorized persons in their
interpretation of the results of such possession and study. Communications security includes
crypto security, transmission security, emission security, and physical security of
communications security materials and information as follows:
Crypto security—The provision of technically sound cryptosystems and their proper use.
Transmission security—All measures designed to protect transmissions from interception and
exploitation by means other than cryptanalysis.
Emission security—All measures taken to deny unauthorized persons information of value that
might be derived from intercept and analysis of compromising emanations from crypto-
equipment and telecommunications systems.
Physical security—All physical measures necessary to safeguard classified equipment, material,
and documents from access thereto or observation thereof by unauthorized person
Contingency—An event or series of events resulting from international or political instabilities,
or other unforeseen disasters of natural or human origin.
Deployment—The relocation of forces to designated areas of operations.
Fixed Nuclear Facility—Stationary nuclear installations that use or produce radioactive
materials in their normal operations. Within the Air Force, these facilities include installations
with nuclear weapons or radioactive materials in sufficient quantities that the general public
might be affected if an accident involving the radioactive materials occurred. It also includes
facilities using NRC-regulated radioactive materials above thresholds in the Code of Federal
Regulations, Schedule C (10 CFR 30.72) for specific emergency plans. Normally, facilities using
AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010                                                           31


radioactive materials in their operations (such as medical, calibration, and radiography) and
radioactive materials in shipments are not included in this definition.
Host Unit—The organization designated by the host MAJCOM or headquarters Air Force, to
provide support to an associate unit.
Incident Commander—The person designated to coordinate rescue efforts at a rescue site; the
senior onsite member, normally the installation support group commander or designated
representative. All disaster response force members at an accident scene are under the command
and control of the incident commander.
Lesson Learned—A problem encountered and corrected; a problem for which no solution was
found; a successful action noted for future operations.
LOGMOD—The system of record for unit logistics readiness organizations. LOGMOD is a
computer software program that runs on computers at both the major command and base level, or
through networked services. It is used to manage a database containing the logistics equipment
and supplies for Air Force unit type codes (UTCs).
Mass Casualties—When a situation exceeds the patient care capabilities of the medical force in
place or when base medical services are faced with the necessity of caring for an influx of
casualties. For exercises, use 10 or more casualties as a baseline.
Master Scenario Events List (MSEL)—A list of sequentially numbered events that direct
exercises toward desired objectives.
Nuclear Weapon Accident—An unexpected event involving nuclear weapons or radiological
nuclear weapon components, resulting in any of the following:
   - U.S. forces’ or U.S. supported/allied forces’ accidental or unauthorized launching, firing, or
   use of a nuclear capable weapon system that could create the risk of an outbreak of war
   - Nonnuclear detonation or burning of a nuclear weapon or radiological nuclear weapon
   component.
   - Radioactive contamination.
   - Seizure, theft, loss, or destruction of a nuclear weapon or radiological nuclear weapon
   component, including jettisoning.
   - Public hazard, actual or implied.
Operating Document—A completed form or other document used to facilitate, accomplish, or
provide a description or record of a transaction, function, or event. The information in an
operating document may provide data or input for a report, but that is not its primary purpose.
Operation Plan—A plan for one or more operations that deployed units carry out
simultaneously or in a series of connected stages. Higher authorities normally issue operation
plans as directives, based on stated assumptions, to allow subordinates to prepare supporting
plans and orders.
Operations Security (OPSEC)—(DoD) A process of identifying critical information and
subsequently analyzing friendly actions attendant to military operations and other activities to: a.
identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems; b. determine
indicators that hostile intelligence systems might obtain that could be interpreted or pieced
together to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries; and c. select and
 32                              AETCI10-205_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 6 DECEMBER 2010


execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of friendly
actions to adversary exploitation.
Trusted Agent—A subject matter expert who provides input to exercise scenarios, creates
implementers, and assists exercise planners in exercise development. Trusted agents may also be
used as controllers.
Unit Type Code—A standard five-digit code that uniquely identifies similar types of military
organizations.
10 CFR 30.72—Schedule lists quantities of radioactive materials requiring consideration of the
need for an emergency plan for responding to a release.

  A5.1.1. (TYNDALL AFB) The Mission Support Phase of an Operational Readiness
  Exercise (ORE, EET-initiated) or Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI, AETC/IG-initiated)
  requires use of resources and actions not subject to evaluation but necessary to facilitate
  demonstration of wartime skills by evaluated personnel. This attachment provides guidance
  on the preparation, teardown, and maintenance of resources and responsibilities for
  supporting exercises/inspections.
  A5.1.2. (TYNDALL AFB) Site preparation provisions of this attachment will be executed
  upon direction of an Exercise Special Instruction (SPIN) issued by 325 FW/XP.
A5.2. (TYNDALL AFB) MISSION SUPPORT PHASE EXERCISE SITE:
  A5.2.1. (TYNDALL AFB) The Mission Support Phase will evaluate the ability of selected
  wing support elements to provide sustained combat support operations at deployed locations
  worldwide. Primary focus is on the ability to survive and operate in a hostile environment.
  Areas subject to evaluation and grading criteria will be as described in AFI 90-201, AETC
  Supplement 1, Inspector General Activities, and AETCI 10-205, AETC Exercise Program.
  A5.2.2. (TYNDALL AFB) The exercise site simulates a portion of an air base, with
  minimal facilities, located some distance behind the forward edge of the battle area (FEBA),
  but still vulnerable to enemy ground and air attack.
  A5.2.3. (TYNDALL AFB) The exercise site (cantonment area) is located in the wooded
  area south of the Civil Engineering Squadron 6000 Area. It is accessible by a minimally
  maintained dirt and gravel road from two entrances near the southeast corner of the 6000
  Area. The normally unsecured gate just outside the fenced portion of the 6000 Area is the
  primary route. Attachment 4 contains a map of the site.
  A5.2.4. (TYNDALL AFB) The cantonment area includes concrete pads, some with
  framing for hard-back tents, one permanent command structure, and a flagpole. The site has
  potable water outlets, electrical service, and administrative telephone lines available.
  A5.2.5. (TYNDALL AFB) All personnel subject to UTC tasking will require the following:
  helmet, one training ensemble with rubber boots, rubber gloves with white inserts, web belt,
  canteen with water, mask, mask carrier and three sets of simulated Mark I auto-injector kits
  (one atropine injector and one 2 PAM C1) and three sets of Convulsion Antidote, Nerve
  Agent (Diazepam) (CANA) injectors. UTC tasked personnel, not employing in the field, are
  subject to chemical warfare defense ensemble (CWDE) donning exercises after processing
  and release of their chalk to EET.
  A5.2.6. (TYNDALL AFB) Mission Support Phase (Employment). The following areas
  will be evaluated:
     A5.2.6.1. (TYNDALL AFB) Safety in all areas of field operations.
     A5.2.6.2. (TYNDALL AFB) Self aid and buddy care.

      OPSEC/COMSEC considerations.
      A5.2.6.6. (TYNDALL AFB) Chemical warfare defense.
      A5.2.6.7. (TYNDALL AFB) Effectiveness of Survival Recovery Center (SRC), as well
      as host base support (not rated).
      A5.2.6.8. (TYNDALL AFB) Communication between SRC and control centers (not
      rated).
A5.3. (TYNDALL AFB) EXERCISE SUPPORT: The Mission Support Phase of AETC
Operational Readiness Inspections and local exercises may require the following:
   A5.3.1. (TYNDALL AFB) Necessary facilities (tents) to house activities being evaluated.
   A5.3.2. (TYNDALL AFB) Administrative telephones, at least one for each of the evaluated
   activity.
   A5.3.3. (TYNDALL AFB) Alerting system, such as Giant Voice or portable megaphones,
   to immediately advise all evaluated personnel of changes in threat and appropriate protective
   measures.
   A5.3.4. (TYNDALL AFB) Equipment and supplies will be limited to those requirements
   identified in specific base support plans or that would be made available at the deployed
   location.
   A5.3.5. (TYNDALL AFB) Deployed ADVON support consisting of a field grade officer as
   commander of deployed forces (COMDEPFOR), up to one deputy commander, up to two
   board posters, an Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) representative, and up to five medical
   personnel for exercise and real-world Casualty Collection Point (CCP) support.
   COMDEPFOR will be the primary input point for exercise events, including directions from
   higher headquarters; simulated by the EET. All ADVON personnel will be subject to
   evaluation, and fully equipped, and required to react to exercise events as ―full-up‖ players.
   The only exception will be medical personnel designated to handle real-world casualties.
   A5.3.6. (TYNDALL AFB) An approved storage location for ground burst simulators
   (GBS) and smoke grenades to be used by qualified evaluators during exercises/inspections.
   A5.3.7. (TYNDALL AFB) Medical Group will provide emergency medical response and

                           EXERCISE SIMULATION LIST (ESL)

NOTE:           Simulation approval does not cancel tasking, it allows units to simulate those
actions deemed excessive in their impact on the wing mission, or incidental to the objectives of
the exercise. Actions are required to ensure the tasking is addressed and to demonstrate the
capability of compliance should real-world requirements dictate (i.e. Signs indicating equipment
moved, ropes indicating doors closed, etc. Verbal explanation of procedures to an inspector will
be allowed only when the simulation itself prevents any physical demonstration of capability).

1. Simulations require review annually. Route changes through group CC to 325 FW/XP for
approval by 31 Jan.

2. Simulation requests may be submitted prior to a Crown Royal exercise to prevent impact with
unforeseen mission requirements, these should be rare.
