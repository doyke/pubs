                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Program Objective. To provide a professional and comprehensive fire
protection/prevention program in order to prevent the loss of life and/or property. This program
is based on Air Force Instruction (AFI), Department of Defense Instruction (DODI),
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and other applicable national
consensus standards.
     1.1.1. For a more complete listing of guidance referenced in the development of this
     instruction; see Attachment 1.
     1.1.2. A successful fire prevention program requires command support at all levels and the
     continuing efforts of all personnel be they military or civilian, employees, contractors,
     dependents, and their guests.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to all personnel, organizations and activities within
the 1st Special Operations Wing (1 SOW), including tenant units, active duty personnel,
contractors, concessionaires, dependents, and their guests while on 1 SOW controlled property.
     1.2.1. Where applicable and to the extent possible this instruction shall apply to all new and
     existing facilities located on or outside of 1 SOW property; whether acquired or leased, by
     appropriated or non-appropriated funds; or occupied by other DOD components; USAFR or
     ANG; or third party financed and constructed.
     1.2.2. This instruction is not intended to supersede any legally mandated or contractual
     requirements.
     1.2.3. This instruction has been developed to afford a minimum level of fire protection and
     life safety.
     1.2.4. It is the responsibility of all 1 SOW personnel to conduct themselves in a manner
     which does not pose an unnecessary risk of fire or injury to themselves or others and to abide
     by the contents of this instruction.
     1.2.5. The goal of the fire prevention office is to prevent fires by educating the base
     populace in fire prevention procedures, and by conducting a rigorous fire prevention visit

11.1. Classification. All buildings are given a fire resistance classification (I-V) according to
type of construction. The modification of the building or the installation of combustible
temporary offices, walls, etc., downgrades the building's classification; therefore, the installation
or erection of combustible structures inside noncombustible-rated structures is prohibited.
11.2. Permission. Obtain written permission from the Base Civil Engineer prior to any
modification on an existing building or the use of installed or combustible structures within the
building.

                     AIRCRAFT FUEL HANDLING AND SERVICING

14.1. Grounding Aircraft. To guard against the danger of static electricity, aircraft will be
properly and effectively grounded as outlined in T.0. 00-25-172 during all servicing, de-fueling,
and maintenance operations, and when hangared, moored, or parked, except when on the ready
line prepared for take-off.
14.2. Fire Prevention Measures. Fire prevention measures will be strictly adhered to during
ground servicing of aircraft, transferring of fuel in storage areas, or performing maintenance on
refueling equipment and facilities.
14.3. Normal Fuel Servicing and De-fueling. Normal fuel servicing and de-fueling will be
accomplished under controlled supervision in accordance with T.0. 00-25-172. No other work
will take place during normal fueling operations. Do not accomplish any fueling operations
when electrical storms are within 10 miles.
14.4. Abnormal Refueling. Hot refueling, concurrent refueling, etc., will be accomplished in
accordance with T.0. 00-25-172. A minimum of 15-minutes notice will be given to the Fire
Protection Flight for request of a standby fire vehicle.
14.5. Fuel Spills. Spilled aircraft fuel is a highly potential source of fire. Take extreme care to
avoid spilling fuel; but if a spill or leak does occur around aircraft, immediately stop all
maintenance or servicing operations and notify the Fire Protection Flight. Every effort will be
taken to preclude spilled fuel from entering storm or sanitary sewers.
14.6. Hydraulic Oil Spills. Hydraulic oil spills will be cleaned up by personnel working on
aircraft or equipment. Firefighting personnel or equipment will not be utilized for this purpose.
14.7. Electrical Safety. Electrical devices and power equipment used in aircraft servicing, de-
fueling, and maintenance operations will be approved explosion-proof type, including motors,
switches, fixtures, and extension lights.
14.8. Engine Starts. A qualified fire guard, adequately equipped and trained, will be stationed
strategically by the aircraft engine being started. The fire guard will stand by in readiness until
all engines are operating and the danger of fire is no longer present.
14.9. Vehicles. To minimize the danger of fire resulting from vehicles operating in hangars,
nose docks, POL, and ammunition storage area, only those vehicles equipped for such locations
will be used. Depending upon the specific hazard category, vehicles will be provided with flame
and spark arresters, no arcing mechanism, etc. Vehicles so equipped will be allowed to operate
in hangars only long enough to move aircraft, equipment, or material, and will not be permitted
to park in front of or near hangar or nose dock doors.
14.10. Oxygen (Liquids and Gaseous). Because of the hazards involved in handling oxygen,
particularly in aircraft servicing operations, only qualified and authorized personnel are
permitted to handle this potentially hazardous substance. The safety standards set forth in T.O.
00-25-172, and other pertinent Air Force publications, will be strictly observed by all personnel
engaged in oxygen handling and servicing operations.
