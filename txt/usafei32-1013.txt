                                            Chapter 1

               NSIP PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. General:
     1.1.1. The NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP) provides a means by which essential
     facilities and certain equipment required by USAFE units committed to NATO may be
     provided from the funds contributed by NATO member nations. In order to realize the
     financial advantage of NATO infrastructure funding, and as required by DoD policy, all
     USAFE requirements will be programmed to the maximum extent possible within NATO
     facility criteria and standards. This will minimize unilateral funding by the United States
     when NATO funding may be secured.
     1.1.2. NSIP funding will pay for infrastructure that is “over and above” what is expected for
     national defense. USAFE installations are traditionally considered to be over and above our
     national defense requirements because of their location in foreign territory. This is unlike
     other member nations of NATO which are expected to offer up existing infrastructure for
     NATO's use.
     1.1.3. NSIP funding is for the minimum military requirement (MMR) necessary to carry out
     the mission and is generally limited to operational facilities. NATO will not fund items such
     as anti-terrorism/force protection criteria, Life Safety Code requirements or space standards
     beyond MMR. The addition of U.S. funds to a NATO project will be required to
     accommodate these requirements.
     1.1.4. Infrastructure paid for with NATO funds will remain available for its NATO mission
     until it is released from that mission by NATO. NATO may choose to change the assigned
     mission of the infrastructure as the needs of the Alliance change. Such changes are made
     through a deliberate process and must be completed with both the host and user nation’s
     approval.
     1.1.5. Modification of facilities listed on the NATO inventory for non-NATO use must
     receive NATO approval prior to changes occurring. Exception: Temporary changes to
     NATO buildings are permissible if the changes can be reversed within 72 hours of
     notification.
     1.1.6. Maintenance of NATO facilities and infrastructure is the responsibility of the user
     nation. NATO will only fund construction and restoration work. NATO does provide for
     periodic restoration of its infrastructure when maintenance is no longer effective in keeping
     the facilities in the best possible condition.
     1.1.7. Munitions support squadron (MUNSS) sites have unique requirements.              Their
     infrastructure maintenance is supported by both the U.S. and their Host Nation.
     1.1.8. Removal or disposal of facilities and equipment from the NATO inventory must
     receive NATO approval prior to any action occurring.
     1.1.9. Pre-financing projects through the use of U.S. funds is not normally encouraged.
     However, projects will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for possible pre-financing when a
USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                               5


   critical need exists and NATO is unable to respond in a timely manner. Headquarters United
   States European Command (EUCOM) is the approval authority for these requests.
   1.1.10. NATO delegates responsibility for contracting and implementation of NSIP projects
   to Host Nations. The U.S. can act as a Host Nation for projects provided the nation(s) in
   which the work will be done agrees to relinquish their responsibilities. Extraordinary
   circumstances are required before nations agree and will be coordinated through EUCOM
   and the Unites States Mission to NATO (USMN).
   1.1.11. Installations and Mission Support Directorate, Programs Division (HQ USAFE/A7P)
   is the focal point for the programming of all U.S. Air Force NATO projects in Europe.
   Design and construction management will be carried out by HQ AFCEE/CMT.
1.2. Responsibilities.

                                            Chapter 2

                      PROGRAMMING NATO FUNDED PROJECTS

2.1. Programming NATO Common Infrastructure Work. Projects eligible for NATO
funding are built to minimum military requirements (MMR) and will be either a Major Works,
MW or Urgent Requirements project. Additionally, Stand-Alone projects may be authorized by
the Infrastructure Committee (IC) but for HQ USAFE/A7P purposes these projects are managed
like Major Works or Minor Works (MW) projects depending on the cost. Specific facilities
and/or infrastructure eligible for NATO funding are presented in applicable NATO Criteria and
Standards. Scope in excess of MMR must be funded by the host or user nation. Infrastructure
and/or facilities to be restored or constructed with NSIP must support a current NATO mission.
The source document for NSIP programming procedures is Bi-SC 85-1, Capability Package
Directive (INTERIM). U.S. responsibilities for implementation of NATO procedures are
explained in ECI 4701.01, Security Investment Program (NSIP) Management. Flow charts in
ECI 4701.01 help visualize the NATO process.
     2.1.1. Major Works: Infrastructure and/or facility requirements costing more than 500,000
     Euros are programmed as a major works project. This amount includes the cost of the work,
     contingencies, design, and national administrative expenses. The programming document for
     a major works project is a PDS. PDSs are included in Capability Packages (CP) to define
     infrastructure requirements needed to support a NATO military capability.
        2.1.1.1. See EUCOM Command Instruction ECI 4701.01, Appendix A to Enclosure D
        for a process flowchart showing NATO’s procedures to develop a CP. PDSs are
        developed as part of this process; the project implementation process is illustrated in the
        flowchart in Appendix B to Enclosure E.
        2.1.1.2. The BCE NATO programmer develops and submits PDSs which will include
        location and site plans to Installations and Mission Support Directorate Programs
        Division, Programs Development Branch, NATO Section (HQ USAFE/A7PDN) . See
        Bi-SC 85-1, Annex G for format. Use the NSIP SharePoint site for submission.
        2.1.1.3. HQ USAFE/A7PDN reviews submittals for NATO eligibility, makes any
        required changes, and submits them to the Host Nation.
        2.1.1.4. HQ USAFE/A7PDN and the Host Nation work with the NATO military
        commands to place the PDS into a CP. This action should occur when a CP or CP
        Addendum is being developed and an Analysis Worksheet (AWS) for the installation is
        prepared. This is the best time to secure support for any desired work on the installation.
        2.1.1.5. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures apply unless waived by the
        IC.
     2.1.2. Minor Works. Minor Works projects for infrastructure supporting a current NATO
     mission may be submitted at any time and are processed independent of the CP program.
     Projects are typically authorized within 6 months of submission to NATO. Host Nation
     procedures add time to the submission process before NATO sees the project. The HQ
     USAFE/A7P floor for MW projects is 50,000 Euros. The ceiling is 500,000 Euros.
USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 9


     2.1.2.1. The process is described          in   EUCOM       Command      Instruction   ECI
     4701.01Appendix B of Enclosure F.
     2.1.2.2. The BCE NATO programmer submits a MWCE, Part I, with site and location
     plans to HQ USAFE/A7PDN and enters project information into ACES-PM. See Bi-SC
     85-1 (INTERIM) paragraph 5.2.7 for the MWCE format. See the NSIP SharePoint site
     for submission.
     2.1.2.3. HQ USAFE/A7PDN reviews and edits submittals, signs the MWCEs and
     submits them to appropriate Host Nation (HN).
     2.1.2.4. The Design Construction Manager (DCM) shall assist the HN with design and
     construction management as required.
  2.1.3. Urgent Requirements. NATO common infrastructure funds can be provided almost
  immediately to repair damage to NATO facilities caused by acts unforeseen at the time of
  normal programming. To be unforeseen the requirement must have arisen because of acts of
  man (e.g. terrorist actions, accidents), "Force Majeure" (e.g. earthquakes, storms, floods, or
  other natural disasters), or un-observable deterioration, over time, which has resulted in
  sudden failure (e.g. ruptured pipeline or deteriorated buried electrical cabling). These type
  incidents can be corrected with an Urgent Requirement project.
     2.1.3.1. The U.S. Mission will not support this programming procedure unless the
     requirement could not have been foreseen.
     2.1.3.2. See EUCOM Command Instruction 4701.01 Appendix A to Enclosure F for a
     process diagram.
     2.1.3.3. The BCE must first take immediate action to make temporary repairs and limit
     any damage using national funds. If these repairs are subsequently determined to be
     NATO eligible, the BCE must submit information for reimbursement as outlined in Bi-
     SC 85-1 (ITERIM), Paragraph 5.7.1 to HQ USAFE/A7PDN. The repairs will normally
     be funded "a posteriori" by NATO.
     2.1.3.4. HQ USAFE/A7PDN will coordinate with EUCOM and the USMN prior to
     forwarding the information to the Host Nation.
     2.1.3.5. Urgent requirements will be implemented in the same way as other infrastructure
     projects once projects are authorized. The Host Nation will prepare the final design in
     coordination with the user and in conformance with the authorized scope. Excess scope
     must be funded by the requester (host or user nation). Contract award and construction
     will be accomplished through the Host Nation. ICB procedures apply unless waived by
     the IC.
  2.1.4. Cost Shares. NATO will pay for the MMR for any construction or restoration for its
  infrastructure. Two circumstances exist where the U.S. will be required to pay a cost share.
  Cost shares could be within O&M or MILCON funding limitations. Statutory limitations for
  U.S. funds will be followed.
     2.1.4.1. Restoration Cost Share: The restoration cost share is a user-funded share applied
     by NATO to restoration projects that are executed before completion of the expected
     service life defined in the Technical Preamble to Bi-MNCD 85-5. Cost shares would be
     prorated based on the actual service life versus the expected service life.

     2.1.4.2. User Cost Share: User cost shares are also applied by NATO when one of the
     following occurs:
        2.1.4.2.1. The project scope exceeds MMR (see NATO Criteria and Standards for
        Airfields, BI-MNCD 85-5, Paragraph 1-6). This typically occurs when U.S.
        standards are applied such as the Life Safety Code or when AFH 32-1084, Facility
        Requirements is used in the design.
        2.1.4.2.2. A utility system serves both NATO and non-NATO facilities.
     2.1.4.3. The BCE NATO programmers will program a project for any U.S. cost share in
     the appropriate program.
  2.1.5. ACES-PM Data Management: The BCE will supplement existing ACES-PM
  guidance for project management when a project is associated with the NSIP program.
     2.1.5.1. For all projects with NATO funding, the project number root will be appended
     with an “N” suffix, for example Project Number ABCD087004 becomes
     ABCD087004N. The PROGRAM TYPE will be set to “O&M,” “MCP” or “OTH” as
     appropriate. The “OTH” choice will be used when no U.S. funding is to be provided to
     the project. In this case, the FUNDING SOURCE and SUB SOURCE on the
     PROGRAMMING Tab will both be set to “NATO.” Otherwise, the FUNDING
     SOURCE and SUB SOURCE on the Programming Tab will both be set depending on the
     PROGRAM TYPE of the U.S. funding.
     2.1.5.2. From the PROGRAMMING tab for each project with NATO funding:
        2.1.5.2.1. Establish a UNIQUES value “USAFE_NATO_NUM” with the assigned
        NATO project number when this number is issued by the Host Nation.
        2.1.5.2.2. Establish an OTHER COSTS value with the ITEM NAME set to
        “NATO_SHARE,” the FY can be NULL, the AMOUNT to the NATO cost in U.S.
        dollars and in the REMARKS column add the exchange rate to the currency, for
        example “$0.75/EUR” or “$1.57/GBP.”
     2.1.5.3. When a project was created without the “N” suffix and subsequently the project
     is identified to be prefinanced, continue to use the existing project number. From the
     PROGRAMMING Tab, establish a project unique value “USAFE_NATO_PFS” with a
     Value equal to “Y.”
     2.1.5.4. Existing projects that were programmed with two separate project numbers will
     be grandfathered if the project has started design. All projects still in a programming
     status will follow these ACES-PM guidelines.
     2.1.5.5. If the Host Nation provides funds for the project, typically only for MUNSS
     sites, optionally create an ACES-PM project for these funds. The project number root
     will be appended with a suffix for the Host Nation, for example Project Number
     ABCD087004 becomes ABCD087004NL in the Netherlands. The PROGRAM TYPE
     will be set to “OTH.” The FUNDING SOURCE on the Programming Tab will be set to
     “HNF” and the SUB SOURCE on the Programming Tab will be null.

                                           Chapter 3

       DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF NATO PROJECTS

3.1. Design and Construction.
   3.1.1. See EUCOM Command Instruction ECI 4701.01 Appendix B to Enclosure E for a
   process diagram on NATO project implementation.
   3.1.2. Host Nations are responsible for the design and construction of NSIP projects and for
   all accounting and auditing procedures that follow construction. NATO provides design and
   construction funds to the Host Nation as identified on the PDS or MWCE. The U.S. must
   provide design funds to the Host Nation to cover design cost for conjunctively funded aspects
   of projects.
   3.1.3. AFCEE/CMT has primary responsibility for oversight of the design and construction
   activities to ensure USAF needs are met.
   3.1.4. Projects must be designed and constructed in accordance with applicable
   Standardization Agreements (STANAG) when a facility is programmed to support NATO
   forces, whether the work is to be funded by NATO or nationally. Contact HQ
   USAFE/A7PDN to get a copy of the latest STANAGs.
   3.1.5. AFCEE/CMT issues design instructions (DI) to the Host Nation when (1) advance
   planning funds are authorized or (2) when a minor works project is authorized (funded) by
   the Infrastructure Committee. Special procedures in Germany require the submission of an
   ABG-3 for 1.5% of the estimated cost when the DI is issued to the German design agency for
   any minor works project. This covers the cost of any lost design should NATO not support
   the project. Bases fund this cost.
   3.1.6. DIs should include project data and justification, site plan, design criteria, definitive
   drawings and specific instructions on design reviews, with a request for preparation and
   submittal of the draft Type B Cost Estimate ((TBCE), 35% design documents). The Host
   Nation may draw advanced planning funds up to 3% of the project cost to initiate project
   design and carry it through the TBCE stage.
   3.1.7. BCE representatives and AFCEE/CMT jointly review draft TBCEs. AFCEE/CMT
   consolidates and forwards review comments to the Host Nation for incorporation into the
   TBCE.
   3.1.8. Host Nations finalize the TBCEs or MWCEs and forwards them to NATO for review
   by the NATO International Staff and authorization by the IC. Upon authorization, Host
   Nations complete the design and award a construction contract. If the construction cost is
   over €5M, a second authorization will be required before the HN can receive the additional
   funds.
   3.1.9. The authorization will include any break out of U.S. cost shares (see paragraph 2.1.4).
   Update any project data in ACES-PM with current cost information. U.S. cost shares are
   paid with U.S. conjunctive funding. HQ USAFE/A7P normally sets aside sufficient O&M
   funds for all projected conjunctive funding each fiscal year before distributing O&M funds to
   bases. Insure HQ USAFE/A7P has included the project in the proper FY based on expected
 12                                                      USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011


   execution year. If the U.S. cost share is MILCON in scope, ensure the project remains in the
   Future Years’ Defense Program (FYDP) until funded.
   3.1.10. Bases must program conjunctive requirements so funds are available when the
   NATO project is ready for construction advertising. NATO will not provide NSIP funds for
   a project until required conjunctive funds are available.
   3.1.11. While overall design of a NATO project is managed by the Host Nation Ministry of
   Defense with oversight by AFCEE/CMT, the BCE is responsible for all local design and
   construction coordination normally associated with any national project. This includes such
   items as design reviews, pre-construction conferences; road, taxiway and runway closures;
   interruption of services (electricity, water, heat, etc) associated with construction; obtaining
   or arranging for restricted area escorts; and all other coordination functions typically
   associated with design and construction work.
   3.1.12. Advertising and Award. After completing the final design, the Host Nation will
   proceed with advertising, award, and construction. International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
   procedures must be used (except for Minor Works projects which are wholly civil works in
   nature; Annex to AC/4-D(94) 004 Final) unless the Infrastructure Committee allows National
   Competitive Bidding (NCB). After contract award, the Host Nation normally schedules a
   pre-construction conference with representatives of the contractor, AFCEE/CMT, and base
   personnel to arrange details for the initiation of construction.
   3.1.13. Inspection and Observation. Inspection of construction for quality control and
   compliance with contract documents is the responsibility of the Host Nation. Observation of
   construction for functional adequacy of projects of U.S. interest is the responsibility of the
   BCE, AFCEE/CMT, and in some countries, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers/Europe
   District, or Naval Facilities Engineering Command/Engineering Field Activity,
   Mediterranean. BCEs will report obvious deviations from plans, specifications, established
   construction procedures within 2 days of occurrence to AFCEE/CMT.
3.2. Acceptance of NATO Facilities. When construction is complete, the Host Nation accepts
the facility from the contractor. The BCE or designated representative, HQ USAFE/A7P and
AFCEE/CMT will attend final contract acceptance. HQ USAFE/A7P will sign the Host Nation
document accepting the facility for U.S. beneficial occupancy. See EUCOM Command
Instruction ECI 4701.01 Appendix C to Enclosure F.
   3.2.1. Joint Formal Acceptance Inspection (JFAI): After construction completion and
   facility acceptance, the Host Nation will request a formal NATO acceptance via a JFAI. The
   Host Nation is required to request a JFAI within 6 months after project completion. In
   practice, however, JFAIs rarely happen this quickly, typically occurring within 2 to 8 years
   after project completion.
      3.2.1.1. A JFAI team consisting of representatives from the Host Nation, HQ
      USAFE/A7P, AFCEE/CMT, NATO military commands, and the NATO International
      Staff (NIS) screener will inspect the project. The primary purposes of a JFAI are to
      determine whether the project was constructed in accordance with good engineering
      practice, is militarily and technically acceptable, meets established NATO criteria and
      standards, is within the scope of the original authorization, and that the responsibility of
      the Host Nation to complete the project has been fully discharged.
USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                13


     3.2.1.2. The team will issue a report identifying any deficiencies discovered and
     recommend acceptance or non-acceptance of the work. Any work not accepted will have
     to be corrected prior to acceptance of the project. Deficiencies identified in the JFAI are
     eligible for NATO common funding. The NIS screener can immediately authorize a
     limited amount of NATO funds to resolve deficiencies.
     3.2.1.3. The JFAI report also notes any excess works discovered (i.e. exceeding
     authorized scope). If there is excess work, the team will recommend if the additional
     work should be authorized. Any excess work not accepted by NATO as a legitimate cost
     will be paid for by the Host or User Nation.
     3.2.1.4. The NIS screener will submit the formal JFAI report to the Infrastructure
     Committee for final approval.
     3.2.1.5. Projects remain subject to review in the event deficiencies or defects not noticed
     at the time of the JFAI are discovered for a period of 2 years after completion of the
     JFAI. Any deficiencies/defects discovered after this period require NSIP programming
     action for correction.
     3.2.1.6. HQ USAFE/A7P will officially sign for the acceptance of the facility on the
     JFAI.
     3.2.1.7. Since the Host Nation is responsible for project execution, all plans,
     specifications, and other documents associated with the project are maintained by the
     Host Nation in preparation for the JFAI. If the U.S. executes the project, the U.S. is
     responsible for maintaining these documents as explained in Bi-SC 85-1, paragraph 5.4.
  3.2.2. Financial Audit: Following the formal acceptance by NATO, the Host Nation will
  schedule a financial audit by the International Board of Auditors. Because of very limited
  manpower, these final audits are very often not accomplished until the work has been
  completed for 10 years or more. When the audit has been completed and all discrepancies
  and/or adjustments satisfied, the board issues a Certificate of Final Financial Acceptance
  (COFFA) that formally relieves the Host Nation of any further accountability for funds
  authorized and expended. This action represents the last step in the NSIP process for a
  project.
  3.2.3. Financial Closeout: Final closeout is the responsibility of the Host Nation but
  requires tracking by the user nation to ensure this important end action is completed in a
  timely manner. In most cases, U.S. involvement ceases after the Infrastructure Committee
  accepts the Financial Acceptance (FA) document.

                                             Chapter 4

                      MAINTENANCE OF NATO INFRASTRUCTURE

4.1. Maintenance: Maintenance of NATO facilities and infrastructure is the financial
responsibility of the user nation. There are two distinct types of maintenance. First is when a
user nation occupies and uses a facility. In this case, the user bears total financial responsibility.
This is best illustrated by NATO facilities on our Main Operating Bases (MOB) that we use on a
continuous basis. Second, there is the case of a NATO facility not occupied by the user. This
could be the situation at one of our Forward Operating Sites (FOS) or Cooperative Security
Locations (CSL). If these facilities remain vacant during peacetime, the U.S. is financially
responsible for their maintenance and upkeep. If they are occupied during peacetime, then the
nation using the facility shares in the financial responsibility for maintenance, normally
dependent upon the amount of usage. If any original user has no further requirement for a
facility, financial responsibility normally continues for one year following receipt by the Major
NATO Commander (MNC) of formal notification that the nation intends to cease use of the
facility; Bi-SC (INTERIM), paragraph 6.6.3, a new user is found, the facility is put on standby
status, or is removed from the NATO inventory.
   4.1.1. Good maintenance and well-kept records will substantiate the requirement for NSIP
   restoration required when facilities eventually deteriorate beyond the point where
   maintenance is practical. Conversely, if it appears that facilities have not been adequately
   maintained, NATO may determine that restorations are not eligible for NSIP funds.
   4.1.2. At munitions support squadron (MUNSS) sites, the HN is responsible for maintenance
   of the NATO facilities assigned to the MUNSS. The U.S. is responsible for U.S.-only
   requirements of the facilities when these facilities are in the Air Force Real Property list.
4.2. NATO Maintenance Inspections.
   4.2.1. NATO Maintenance Inspections are scheduled periodically by Joint Force Command
   Brunssum or Joint Force Command Naples to determine adequacy of facility maintenance;
   estimate facility life expectancy; assess current capability to perform assigned missions;
   verify that spare parts are operational; examine status of corrected JFAI deficiencies; assist in
   overcoming any difficulties which have been detected in facility maintenance; and review
   proposed NATO projects. The maintenance inspection team is comprised of representatives
   from the Host Nation, the user nation, and one of the regional commands. HQ
   USAFE/A7PDN will represent the U.S. as the user nation and will fully coordinate all
   maintenance inspection visits with the respective BCE.
   4.2.2. Base personnel need to arrange the following when hosting a NATO maintenance
   inspection:
       4.2.2.1. Set up a courtesy call (in-brief and out-brief) with the wing or base commander.
       4.2.2.2. Briefing by BCE personnel on base engineering activities including new
       construction in progress; maintenance systems employed; recent past, present and
       planned maintenance programs; list of NATO projects which may attract NATO funds
       for restoration in the future; and all known existing deficiencies with NATO facilities.
USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  15


     This briefing should include a brief synopsis of the mission of the base and the type of
     aircraft which the base engineering function is asked to support.
     4.2.2.3. Tour of base NATO facilities. Time will normally not permit every facility to be
     inspected, but the following should be accomplished:
         4.2.2.3.1. Examples of every NATO criteria item should be inspected.
         4.2.2.3.2. The worst examples must be inspected.
         4.2.2.3.3. Attention must be drawn to facilities that require NSIP restoration funds
         now or within the next few years.
         4.2.2.3.4. Arrange in advance entry authority to secure areas and aircraft movement
         surfaces.
         4.2.2.3.5. Building managers for each facility visited must be available, aware of the
         visit, and prepared to point out such problems as roof and window leaks, faulty doors,
         cracks in walls, etc.
         4.2.2.3.6. Keys must be readily available to gain entry to locked facilities.
         4.2.2.3.7. Time and space must be made available to consolidate findings and prepare
         any required paperwork. A quiet area with chairs and table is required.
     4.2.2.4. Base personnel need to provide the following documents to support the
     inspection:
         4.2.2.4.1. A large-scale plan of the base showing every NATO facility listed by
         criteria item. This is a key document and the inspection team will require one for its
         own use and retention.
         4.2.2.4.2. Log books for standby generators, arrestor gear, cranes, and any other
         similar NATO equipment.
         4.2.2.4.3. List of NATO 90-day spare parts (the team will want to see these parts).
  4.2.3. A base communications officer must be available to discuss communications matters
  when those systems and facilities are inspected.
 16                                                     USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011


                                           Chapter 5

                             NATO SPARE PARTS PROGRAM

5.1. NATO authorizes NSIP funding for certain essential facilities and equipment that have
been determined by NATO military authorities to be so critical that they must be kept operating
under wartime conditions. To accomplish this, NATO finances the initial supply of spare parts
sufficient to maintain the facility in time of war for a 90-day period. Spare parts are normally
provided for the following airfield criteria items:
   5.1.1. Aircraft arresting gear.
   5.1.2. Electrical and mechanical equipment associated with airfield lighting.
   5.1.3. Standby electrical power generators.
   5.1.4. On-base fuel storage and dispensing facilities.
5.2. The user nation must maintain this stock of spares. The use of this 90-day supply of
spare parts during peacetime is encouraged to assure, through stock rotation, newer items are
always on the shelf. The requirement for 90-day spares will be identified and agreed upon by
HQ USAFE/A7P and the responsible BCE during the project planning/programming stage and
included in the PDS or MWCE document, as appropriate. The spare parts decision will be
included in review comments to the Host Nation for inclusion in the project.
5.3. NATO 90-day spare parts for U.S. main operating bases (MOB) will be maintained in
the BCE or base supply storage area.
   5.3.1. They will be clearly identified as being NATO spare parts and will not be issued
   without the specific approval of the BCE.
   5.3.2. When NATO spare parts are issued at U.S. MOBs, replacements will be immediately
   ordered so the proper level is maintained. Normal supply acquisition procedures will be used
   to requisition replacement items at U.S. expense.
   5.3.3. If a determination is made that spare parts are no longer needed (e.g., a system is
   upgraded or changed), the BCE will contact the HQ USAFE/A7P for disposition instructions.
   NATO must be given the opportunity to reclaim spare parts and receive any financial
   compensation from their disposition.
   5.3.4. The status of NATO 90-day spare parts at U.S. MOBs will be reviewed during NATO
   maintenance inspections and must be readily available for viewing by the inspecting officer.
   The BCE is responsible for ensuring these spare parts are available and will provide the
   inspector with a consolidated list of all NATO-funded spare parts prior to the start of the
   inspection.
USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                               17


                                          Chapter 6

    REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING OF NATO FACILITIES

6.1. At the completion of construction , the Host Nation construction agency provides the
completed NATO facilities to the BCE for beneficial occupancy. Real property accountability
will be established based upon Host Nation documentation and input as NATO real property
assets in the Air Force real property accountable records (ACES-RP).
6.2. HQ USAFE/A7P will forward documentation noting final acceptance by the IC, together
with the JFAI report, to the BCE. Upon receipt, the BCE will use these NATO documents as
additional permanent supporting documents to be filed in the facility folder.
   6.2.1. Quantitative accounting of NATO common infrastructure facilities is identical to the
   accounting requirements for U.S. funded property.
   6.2.2. Monetary accounting of NATO common infrastructure facilities is required. Data will
   be captured under the “estimated value” data field in ACES-RP. The Host Nation is
   responsible for monetary accounting of NATO common infrastructure facilities. The BCE
   will obtain pertinent cost data from the local Host Nation construction agency for
   background information. If cost data cannot be obtained locally, the BCE may request
   assistance from HQ USAFE/A7P to obtain cost data from the Host Nation.
   6.2.3. All real property accountable records for NATO common infrastructure facilities will
   be over stamped "NATO INFRASTRUCTURE" to make them distinguishable.
6.3. All facilities for which the BCE has established real property accountable records will be
included and reported in the real property inventory according to AFI 32-9005, Real Property
Accountability and Reporting. NATO common fund expenditures will not be reported in the
inventory as a cost to the U.S. Government; record these costs in the “estimated value” data
field.
6.4. NATO common infrastructure facilities, including real property installed equipment
(RPIE), will not be removed from the inventory without the specific written approval from the
HQ USAFE/A7PDN. Appropriate disposition instructions will be issued on a case-by-case (see
Chapter 4, Release from NATO Inventory).
6.5. All NATO common infrastructure buildings will be identified as such by painting the
letter "N" immediately in front of the building identification number (using the same color and
configuration as the building number), e.g., facility 115 becomes N-115 when funded by NATO.
6.6. Offering Existing Facilities to NATO.
   6.6.1. When an existing facility satisfies a NATO wartime requirement, it may be
   appropriate to offer the facility to NATO rather than request new construction. After
   acceptance into the NATO inventory, the facility will be eligible for NSIP restoration funds
   when required.
   6.6.2. To offer a facility to NATO, bases submit a request to HQ USAFE/A7PDN stating the
   Facilities Board wants to offer a facility to NATO. HQ USAFE/A7PDN will forward this
   request to the Host Nation, who will forward it to NATO. NATO will determine whether
   they need the facility and will conduct a JFAI if they do.
18                                                     USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011


  6.6.3. Offering facilities to NATO and their inclusion in a JFAI does not constitute a transfer
  of real property jurisdiction and control by the Air Force to the Host Nation or NATO. It is
  intended to establish an official record of those existing facilities at an installation which,
  over and above existing or programmed NATO common infrastructure facilities, meet
  current NATO approved criteria and standards and may be restored with NATO common
  infrastructure funds. Real property jurisdiction, control, and accountability for those
  facilities will be retained by the U.S. as user nation.
  6.6.4. Procedures for accomplishing JFAIs for existing facilities vary from country-to-
  country. All JFAIs are scheduled by the NATO International Staff through the Host Nation
  and are coordinated with HQ USAFE/A7P. They furnish the BCE specific guidance and
  instructions concerning the preparation, accomplishment, documentation and recording of
  each JFAI. HQ USAFE/A7P will attend JFAI proceedings and sign the record as the user
  nation.

                           PRE-FINANCING AND RECOUPMENT

7.1. General. Pre-financing is the expenditure of national funds for eligible or potentially
eligible NSIP work with the expectation of recouping (recovering) those funds at a later date.
Pre-financing is normally accomplished when NATO is unable to provide funds within the time
period that a nation requires work to be done, usually due to fund limitations or project priorities.
The U.S. should only pre-finance projects when an organization cannot wait until the work is
approved and authorized (funded) by NATO. See Attachment 2 for a sample PFS statement.
PFS Statements are submitted via the NSIP SharePoint site.
7.2. Procedures.
   7.2.1. See guidance in EUCOM Command Instruction 4701.01, Paragraph 5 c and Enclosure
   E.
   7.2.2. Prior to awarding an NSIP-eligible project, and after coordinating with the Host
   Nation , HQ USAFE/A7PDN submits PFSs to EUCOM/ECJ4-EN . EUCOM/ECJ4-EN will
   submit the PFS to the USMN.
   7.2.3. Submit the PFSs at least 90 days prior to the contract award date to allow sufficient
   time for HQ USAFE/A7PDN, EUCOM/ECJ4-EN, the USMN, and the NATO IC to take
   appropriate action. If the construction contract has already been awarded, a PFS can still be
   submitted but may not be supported by the IC.
   7.2.4. Ensure any pre-financed projects are bid using International Competitive Bidding
   (ICB) rules unless the IC waives this requirement. If the U.S. wishes to avoid using ICB,
   state this on the PFS and provide strong justification.
   7.2.5. Consider the following three options for pre-financing:
       7.2.5.1. Option 1: The Host Nation (HN) pre-finances and executes the project. In this
       situation the HN takes on the responsibility and financial burden. The HN generates and
       staffs the PFS, executes the project, manages the project files, seeks NSIP approval, and
       obtains recoupment of HN funds. Since there is no financial risk, project execution, or
       recoupment responsibilities for the U.S., this is the preferred pre-financing option.
       7.2.5.2. Option 2: The U.S. pre-finances the project and the HN executes the project. In
       this instance, the U.S. takes on the financial risk while the HN assumes project execution
       responsibilities. The advantage is the HN will be responsible for retaining and submitting
       project and financial documents required to recoup funds for the U.S. This is the typical
       option for pre-financed projects.
       7.2.5.3. Option 3: The U.S. both pre-finances and executes the project. This option is
       used when the U.S. needs to execute work faster than a HN can. With this option, the
       U.S. takes on both financial and record-keeping risks and must retain all contract
       documents, payment vouchers, drawings, etc. for 5 to 10 years (and sometimes longer)
       after the project has been completed. Without proper records, the U.S. risks paying back
       funds to NATO for unsubstantiated expenditures. If this option is chosen, overstamp all
       records with “NATO Infrastructure Pre-financed” to help assure their retention beyond
 20                                                    USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011


      the normal administrative period. Prepare a TCCE, preferably at the time of construction
      completion (when more paperwork is available and memories are fresh). If possible,
      make preparation of the TCCE part of the contract. Send the completed TCCE to HQ
      USAFE/A7PDN for action.
      7.2.5.4. Turkey views pre-financed projects as NATO projects and insists on exercising
      Host national responsibilities for these projects.
   7.2.6. Track a pre-financed project in ACES-PM. When Option 1 in Paragraph 7.2.5. is
   used, the FUNDS_SOURCE is identified as Host Nation and the FUNDING_SUBSOURCE
   is NATO. Projects using Options 2 or 3 in Paragraph 7.2.5 will follow U.S. programming
   rules.
   7.2.7. For the U.S., recoupment funds go to the USMN and are used to fulfill the annual U.S.
   financial obligation to NATO. Recoupment funds can be returned to a service department or
   base only when NSIP funds are exchanged with U.S. funds within the same FY the project is
   awarded.
7.3. Track infrastructure that has been pre-financed as in the same manner as direct and
indirect U.S. dollar funded facilities in ACES-RP. When the IC approves the JFAI report,
change the record to reflect that NATO funded the construction. The NATO documents will
become permanent supporting documentation to the changed real property accountable records.
Change the real property records overstamp from "NATO INFRASTRUCTURE - PRE-
FINANCED" to "NATO INFRASTRUCTURE".
   7.3.1. Retain original cost data in the remarks section of the cited forms for background
   information.
   7.3.2. Prefix the facility number with an "N" as outlined in Paragraph 6.6
USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  21


                                           Chapter 8

                       RELEASE FROM THE NATO INVENTORY

8.1. Periodically , NATO-funded facilities or equipment cease to be needed for a specified
NATO mission. The user nation is responsible for initiating requests to delete facilities or
equipment from the NATO inventory. The Host Nation (HN) cannot request deletion from the
NATO inventory without consent of the user nation.
   8.1.1. Bases shall continuously assess the future uses of their facilities. NATO reserves the
   first right to continue use of infrastructure for NATO purposes. If released facilities can be
   used to satisfy the requirements of another U.S. NATO eligible project, NATO will direct
   that use.
   8.1.2. Before deciding to release the facility from the NATO Inventory consider if a current
   or future U.S. national military use may exist for the facility. If the U.S. intends to use the
   NATO facility for national military use, it should be stated in the request for deletion from
   the NATO inventory.
   8.1.3. Review EUCOM Command Instruction ECI 4701.01, Enclosure G for additional
   procedures when this action affects an entire installation or site.
   8.1.4. The Host Nation officially informs the JFC, Strategic Command, and NIS of the U.S.
   request to release facilities from the NATO inventory. Should the Host Nation non-concur;
   the Host Nation would forward its own future use request to NATO. All actions on the
   release of facilities from the NATO inventory require NATO IC approval.
8.2. Procedures.
   8.2.1. The BCE submits a request to delete NATO facilities and/or equipment to HQ
   USAFE/A7PDN.
       8.2.1.1. Include the facility number, facility description, FA document number and a
       listing of the equipment (installed/mobile), with associated document numbers as
       applicable. Requests must also include the number of NATO manpower positions
       (associated documents/positions numbers) affected by the deletion/change of use.
       Additionally, include information on expected future U.S. national military use.
       8.2.1.2. In cases involving U.S. investments in NATO facilities beyond routine
       maintenance and repair, the BCE should forward documents (invoices, scope of work) to
       support possible future claims for residual value for facilities being released from the
       U.S. control.
   8.2.2. HQ USAFE/A7PDN processes and submits the deletion request to Headquarters
   European Command, Logistics and Security Assistance Directorate, Engineering Division
   (EUCOM/ECJ4-EN) for action. EUCOM/ECJ4-EN notifies the Host Nation and appropriate
   NATO organizations. The date of this notification starts the one year clock for facility
   maintenance. See Bi-SC 85-1(Interim) for information on the maintenance requirement.
   8.2.3. HQ USAFE/A7PDN will coordinate a facility condition inspection, if required, with
   the user, BCE, Host Nation, JFC, and NIS.
22                                                  USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011


  8.2.4. The BCE will continue facility maintenance for up to one year after notification is
  given to the JFC/Strategic Command. Maintenance must continue until a “FA” document is
  received noting the deletion from the NATO inventory or the one year period expires.

Terms
A Posteriori—This describes a situation when a project, suitable for NATO infrastructure
funding, has been contracted for or constructed using national funds without national pre-
financing being properly noted by the IC. As a result, the project is usually considered ineligible
for NATO recoupment funding even though this would not have been the case had the project
been submitted in the prescribed manner prior to contract award. A waiver to "a posteriori"
request must be submitted to the USMN to gain any recoupment. This waiver is rarely accepted
by NATO. See pre-financing statement.
Architect/Engineer (A/E) Fees—In accepting the construction task, the Host Nation is, entitled
to claim infrastructure of 5% of the cost of the project to cover its national administrative
expenses (NAE), or claim A/E fees at actual cost, plus NAE fees of 3%.
Allied Command Operations (ACO)—The NATO command at the first tier or strategic level,
at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), near Mons/Belgium commanded by
Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). It performs operational duties.
Allied Command Transformation (ACT)—The NATO command at the first tier or strategic
level headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia. It performs duties focused on transformation of
NATO’s military capabilities to meet changing requirements.
Authorized Project—An approved CP project which has been submitted to the IC in the NATO
TBCE format, and for which the IC has authorized the Host Nation to disburse NATO funds.
Capability Package (CP)—A combination of Host Nation, user nation, and NATO funded
infrastructure, and associated operations and maintenance costs which, together with assigned
military forces and other essential requirements, enable a NATO commander to achieve a
specific NATO Military Required Capability. See Bi-SC 85-1.
USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    25


Confirmation—This term is used to describe the hold action placed on the authorization of an
infrastructure project by a member of the Infrastructure Committee. For one of a variety of
reasons, the member nation placing the confirmation needs to research some aspect of the project
before giving their positive vote. The lifting of the confirmation or voting negatively for the
project can be given at subsequent IC meetings.
Conjunctive Funding—The use of U.S. funds to pay for non-NATO eligible work that is part of
an overall NATO funded project. The use of conjunctive funds is strictly controlled and
normally limited to those applications which bring a NATO facility into compliance with U.S.
health, safety, security, or fire laws. Exceptions are granted on a case-by-case basis.
Conjunctive funds for major works projects are programmed for by Installations and Mission
Support Directorate (HQ USAFE/A7). Conjunctive funds for MW projects are programmed for
by the BCE.
Criteria—Type, scope, and construction standards for facilities supported by SHAPE as the
MMR and approved for NATO common financing. See Minimum Military Requirement.
Defense Planning Committee (DPC)—A NATO committee composed of representatives of the
member nations participating in NATO's integrated defense structure. Deals with matters
specifically related to NATO defense. The DPC is one of the two approval bodies for CPs.
Defense Planning Questionnaire (DPQ)—A NATO publication which identifies national
commitments to NATO by weapons system type, category, and deployment location. The U.S.
input to the DPQ is classified U.S. SECRET and is released to NATO by the JCS as NATO
SECRET.
Deficiency—A shortcoming or defect in the operational or technical aspect of a project detected
during the course of a JFAI. Any deficiencies are listed in the JFAI document. If NATO
funding is still actively controlled by the HN for the project, the deficiency can be corrected with
these funds. If the project is financially closed out or if insufficient funding exists, the HN is
advised to approach NATO with a MW project to correct the deficiency.
Deleted Project—This is a project or portion of a project which has not started construction, but
which appears in an approved CP, and must be deleted because mission or other changes have
eliminated the need for the project.
Documents—The NATO documents most likely to be encountered at base and command level
are listed below. These documents relate to the proceedings of the Infrastructure Committee:
a. "A" Document. Details the Agenda (A) of the committee meetings.
b. "D" Document. Contains NATO International Staff comments or recommendations to the
committees on the procedures and details of the management of NATO Infrastructure.
c. "DS" Document. Records committee formal statements and decisions. Also referred to as a
Decision Sheet.
d. "M" Document. Refers to a Memorandum issued by the International Staff to a committee in
response to that committee's request for information.
e. "N" Document. A Note circulated by the Committee Secretary usually indicating
formal cognizance by the Committee of national intentions such as pre—financing.
f. "WP" Document. Signifies that the document is a Working Paper.
 26                                                      USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011


g. “FA” Document. Contains Final Acceptance or Deletion from NATO inventory
decisions/statements. These documents contain the results of JFAIs. The documents
contain a listing of the as—built inventory, the deficiencies or variations from criteria, and any
work in excess of the funds authorization that may be recommended for NATO funding.
Eligibility—A project is considered eligible for NATO common infrastructure funding when it
falls within a category already agreed to by the NATO nations for implementation with
infrastructure funds. Once this consideration has been satisfied, the following restrictive criteria
are applied:
a. The project must result from a NATO military requirement.
b. The project must support forces earmarked or assigned to NATO.
c. The project must support an approved NATO mission outlined in a CP.
d. The project must be of the most austere standard conforming to NATO criteria. NATO will
not pay for requirements exceeding MMR, however, they may be included if U.S. national
financing is available to pay for them.
Estimated Date of Authorization Request (EDAR)—The estimated date the Host Nation
intends to submit the TBCE or TCCE to the IC requesting authorization of NATO funds for the
project. See Funds Request, NATO type "B" cost estimate, NATO type "C" cost estimate, and
Infrastructure Committee.
Estimate Date of Completion (EDC)—The estimated construction completion date of the
project.
Estimate Date of Start (EDS)—The estimated construction start date of the project.
Excess Works—These are completed works which have been noted by the JFAI team as being
in excess of the authorized scope or quality of the programmed infrastructure project. Based
upon recommendations of the JFAI team, the IC will either authorize the excess works for
payment by NATO, or refer items they cannot agree to authorize to the NATO Board of
Auditors. The Board of Auditors will then request repayment from the host or user nation, as
applicable, when the project is audited for those items not authorized by the IC as excess works.
See Joint Formal Acceptance Inspection.
Funds Request—This term is applied to the submittal by the Host Nation of a TBCE or TCCE
to the IC requesting authorization of NATO funds for the project.
Host Nation (HN)—Normally the nation having infrastructure projects located on its territory.
However, certain NATO agencies/commands and the strategic commands can be designated by
the IC as a "pseudo" Host Nation for specific projects (normally those spanning national
boundaries).
Infrastructure—As used within NATO, infrastructure is generally applicable to all fixed and
permanent installations, fabrications, or facilities for the support and control of military forces.
Infrastructure includes all requirements within recognized criteria for the categories covered by
eligibility. The terms “NATO common infrastructure” or "national infrastructure" indicate
funding responsibility.
Investment Committee (IC)—The main body within NATO responsible for infrastructure
matters. Conducts final screening of annual programs submitted by member nations prior to
USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   27


formal approval by the NAC or Defense Planning Committee (DPC), and grants authorization to
the host country to commit funds and execute an approved project. The IC is authorized to make
any decision necessary for program implementation. As such, this committee is the key
decision-making body for authorization and execution of infrastructure programs.
International Board Of Auditors for NATO (IBAN)—After construction is complete,
accounts relating to commonly financed NATO infrastructure works are audited by the
International Board of Auditors for NATO. If expenditure by the user nation cannot be
substantiated with documentation, an audit may result in the requirement for the nation to return
funds to NATO. The end product of a NATO audit is the Certificate of Final Financial
Acceptance (COFFA).
International Competitive Bidding (ICB)—A mandatory procedure, unless specifically waived
by NATO, which requires the Host Nation to open bidding for procurement and contracting of
NATO projects to all NATO member nations. ICB can take up to 6 months to accomplish. The
alternative is national competitive bidding (NCB) which requires a waiver to ICB. NCB limits
the bidding process to Host Nation contractors.
Joint Force Command (JFC)—The second tier or operational level of command consisting of
standing joint force commands (JFC) in Brunssum, the Netherlands, and in Naples, Italy, both of
which can conduct operations from their static locations or provide a land-based Combined Joint
Task Force (CJTF) headquarters, and a robust but more limited standing joint headquarters
(JHQ), in Lisbon, Portugal, from which a deployable sea-based CJTF headquarters capability can
be drawn. These organizations provide support to Allied Command Operations (ACO) in the
development of CP’s, maintenance of NATO inventory, and validation of project requirements.
Joint Formal Acceptance Inspection (JFAI)—Following completion of a NATO project, a
team consisting of representatives of the NIS, NATO military authorities, and representatives of
host and user nations visit the installation and inspect the project. The team records deficiencies
and either recommends facility acceptance to the IC or requests changes to the project before
final acceptance is recommended.
Maintenance—Recurring scheduled and un-scheduled work required to ensure continuous and
effective use of NATO facilities and their designed capability, and to prevent excessive wear.
Maintenance is a user nation funding responsibility and does not include additions to,
alternations of, or restoration of a facility.
Maintenance Inspection—Major Subordinate Command (MSC) inspections conducted on a
periodic basis for the purpose of determining the adequacy of user nation maintenance of NATO
facilities and systems; to recommend remedial actions to user nations for the correction of
existing deficiencies; and to review user proposed NATO projects.
Major Works—A project which is either too complex to fit the description of a MW project, or
for which the programmed amount exceeds the MW financial limitation or "ceiling.” See minor
works.
Military Committee (MC)—The highest military authority in NATO. Composed of the chiefs-
of-staff of all member nations except France and Iceland. France is represented by the Chief of
the French Military Mission to the MC. Iceland has no military forces and is usually represented
by the U.S. The MC makes recommendations to the North Atlantic Council (NAC) and the DPC
 28                                                    USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011


on measures considered necessary for the common defense of the NATO area, and supplies
guidance on military matters to the MNCs.
Minimum Essential Facilities (MEF)—Facilities essential to airfield operations consisting of
fuel and ammunition storage for 7 days and dispersed aircraft parking for assigned aircraft.
Considered the absolute minimum facility requirements over and above bare-base (runway and
source of water) requirements necessary to permit aircraft operations from a NATO airfield.
Minimum Military Requirements (MMR)—The most austere facility or item of equipment
needed to meet a NATO military need. The basic needs are agreed to by the member nations.
Minor Works (MW)—A discrete project, self-standing and completely usable, not part of a
currently proposed project, not generating any NATO O&M costs, and not planning or
consulting services associated with a larger project. The project must be straight-forward and
non-controversial. Further, the total programmed amount, including National Administrative
Expenses (NAE) and 10% contingency fees, should be equal to or less than the MW ceiling.
Minor Works Cost Estimate (MWCE)—A NATO prescribed format for the submission of a
MW project. Part I of the MWCE is initiated by the user nation and submitted to the HN. The
HN completes Part II of the MWCE and submits the combined document to the JFC
National Administrative Expenses (NAE)—NAEs are expenses incurred by Host Nations
while executing functions required to implement a NATO infrastructure project. Typical
functions include determining requirements; establishing standards, conducting site surveys,
preparing initial plans required to determine the general magnitude of a project; preparing
detailed engineering drawings; preparing detailed cost estimates; preparing and placing a
project under contract; processing of payments; supervision and inspection of construction;
factory inspection of equipment; provision of supporting services such as financing, accounting,
auditing, translating, and communications; and visits and discussion of infrastructure problems
with NATO military commands and other NATO bodies.
National Competitive Bidding (NCB)—See international competitive bidding.
NATO Accounting Unit (NAU)—A notional currency used by NATO to establish a single basis
for all financial dealings used prior to the implementation of the Euro.
NATO International Staff (NIS)—A group of technical experts employed by NATO to advise
NATO committees on technical and financial matters.
NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP)—A military facilities program financed by
NATO member nations in support of NATO military forces. Limited by criteria to projects for
joint use or clearly accepted as being in the common interest.
North Atlantic Council (NAC)—The highest decision-making authority in NATO composed of
representatives of the member nations. The U.S. Ambassador to NATO meets weekly with the
NAC as the permanent U.S. representative (in place of the U.S. Secretary of State). Twice a year
the U.S. Secretary of State assumes his/her chair on the NAC along with the Secretaries of other
member nations. The NAC is one of the two approval bodies for CPs.
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)—The North Atlantic Treaty, signed in
Washington DC on 4 April 1949, created an alliance for collective defense as defined in Article
51 of the United Nations Charter.
USAFEI32-1013 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    29


Precautionary Pre-Financing Statement—A formal Host Nation statement submitted to the IC
providing notification that a user nation intends to proceed with construction of an item which is
not currently eligible for NATO common funding, but which may become eligible at a later date.
A precautionary pre-financing statement must meet the same IC notification deadlines as the pre-
financing statement and may require ICB.
Pre-Financing Statement (PFS)—A formal Host Nation statement submitted to the IC
providing notification of user nation intent to proceed with construction of an item which is fully
or partially eligible for NATO funding. The pre-financing statement must be noted by the IC
prior to contract award in order to preserve future recoupment rights. Failure to meet this
deadline, will place the project in an "a posteriori" status and most likely result in total loss of
recoupment moneys.
Pre-Financing—The use of national funds to pay for NATO eligible work prior to NATO
authorization to use NATO funding. Pre-financing is accomplished with user nation funds
because NATO funds are either not yet available, or will not be available soon enough to satisfy
project requirements. This action is taken with the expectation that recoupment will be sought
from NATO at some later date using normal NATO programming procedures.
Project Data Sheet (PDS)—This is the NATO programming document. The Project Data Sheet
is an abbreviated programming justification document that contains the following information:
Date; CP Number; Serial Number; Project Title; NCP Title; Location, Implementation Plan;
Item Description and Cost; Capital Cost Profile; Description of Work; Statement of
Justification; and Eligibility Criteria References. The PDS was formerly know as a Type 'A'
Cost Estimate.
Recoupment—The process of regaining pre-financed funds from NATO.
Removal from NATO Inventory—This process covers completed infrastructure projects for
which there is no longer a current or expected future NATO military use. The situation usually
arises through a change of plans, or the phasing out of earlier weapons systems. If there is
clearly no present or future NATO military use for the facility, the Host Nation may request the
IC to remove the facility from the NATO inventory and return it to the Host Nation for disposal.
Restoration—Work or equipment required which is beyond normal maintenance, to bring
NATO facilities up to the criteria in force at the time of the original construction or procurement
of the facility.
Silence Procedure—During periods when the IC is not in session, a Host Nation requiring an
authorization for an urgent project may submit a funds request to the NIS, who will screen it and
issue a "working paper." The NIS circulates the working paper with a cover letter informing all
national delegations and commands of the request for authorization. The project is considered
authorized unless a national delegation or the NMC concerned voices objections to the project
within 2 weeks of the publication of the working paper.
Standardization Agreement (STANAG)—Agreements developed when NATO nations feel a
need to standardize a system or facility, such as airfield lighting. These standards are to be
followed each time such a facility is programmed to support NATO forces, whether the work is
to be funded by NATO or nationally. The development of a STANAG does not constitute
NATO eligibility. It is an agreement to standardize, not to fund.

Stand Alone Project—A project that is not tied to a CP but is beyond the scope of the MW
program. The IC can authorized stand alone projects to meet infrastructure needs.
Type “B” Cost Estimate (TBCE)—Also referred to as the NATO Type "B" Submittal. This
document identifies the project by location and NATO project number. It consists of preliminary
engineering drawings based on the pre-final design, and a line item breakout with cost estimates,
including costs of design, supervision, overhead, and contingencies. The TBCE is approximately
equal to a U.S. 35% design.
Type “C” Cost Estimate (TCCE)—Also referred to as the NATO Type "C" Submittal. This
document contains a detailed cost estimate based on actual contract award costs broken down
into the various areas of the project (keyed to drawings) and including costs of design,
supervision, and overhead. This estimate is the primary basis for the request for recoupment.
U.S. Mission to NATO (USMN)—The U.S. representation to NATO and headed by an
ambassador who functions as the permanent U.S. representative to the NAC. The USMN is
located in NATO compound in Brussels, Belgium.

guidelines for common funding, that for operational, safety, environmental, or economic reasons
need to be implemented in such as timely manner that they cannot await approval and
authorization as part of planned CPs.
User Nation—The nation whose military force occupies and operates a NATO infrastructure
facility. The U.S. is always a user nation anywhere in Europe (except when acting as the
custodial nation). As a result, the U.S. starts the programming process by planning, justifying,
and submitting projects in support of their NATO assigned forces, oversees project
implementation and, after accepting a completed facility, is responsible for its operation and
maintenance.

MEMORANDUM FOR HQ EUCOM/ECJ4-EN
FROM:        HQ USAFE/A7P
             Unit 3050 Box 10
             APO AE 09094-5010
SUBJECT:           Pre-financing Statement for Project Title, Project Location
1. The following information is provided to you for coordination and transmission to USMN for their
notification to the IC of our intent to pre-finance the following works:
   a. General Description and Urgency. BCE provides a description of work and state why the project
cannot wait for the NATO project process. Be specific in explaining why waiting will harm the mission.
Examples can be for military security, possible shutdown by local environmental authorities, imminent
mission failure, etc.
      b. Scope of work and cost estimate. BCE states the scope of work and estimated cost for the project.
      c. Status of project. BCE states the status of the project, i.e. designed, ready to advertise, etc.
   d. Status of Strategic and Regional Command support. HQ USAFE/A7PDN states if either the
regional or strategic command has provided any support for the project during visits to the installation or
by other means. Also note what CP the work supports.
   e. Time factors: BCE states the schedule of the project including when the project will be awarded,
start and finish construction.
    f. International (or National) Competitive Bidding (I (N)CB). ICB will be used for this project. (or
Due to the urgency of this project as explained in Para 1.a., we request an exemption from ICB. We plan
to follow national competitive bidding procedures.) If the project is MW, NCB would be the normal
course. See Bi-SC 85-1, Para 5.7.2.y.
   g. Host Nation approval: We have coordinated this statement with the Host Nation and expect their
support at the IC. (Modify the statement if necessary. It is unwise to submit a project that doesn’t have
HN support.)
2. Request this pre-financing statement be noted at an Infrastructure Committee meeting no later than
(date). Establish the date based on your bid schedule. EUCOM requests 60 days minimum for timely
notification. Do not award projects before the NATO Infrastructure Committee takes action on this
document!
3. If you have any questions, please contact my project manager, (NATO Project Manager). HQ
USAFE/A7PDN, at DSN 480-6227.
