This instruction implements AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning. It expands the guidance provided in
AFSOCR 55-2, Theater Air Force Special Operations Component, and provides detailed organizational
structures and specific functional tasks relating to 16 Special Operations Wing (SOW) operations when
deployed as the Air Force Special Operations Component (AFSOC) of a theater Special Operations Com-
mand (SOC) or Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF). These procedures may be tailored when
the Commander, AFSOC (COMAFSOC) is designated as the Joint Special Operations Air Component
Commander. Unless otherwise stated, the term AFSOC will refer to the theater Air Force Special Opera-
tions Component, and not HQ AFSOC.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This publication has been renumbered from HFI 55-2 to HFI 10-402 to align it with the appropriate
AFPD. Attachment 12 has been moved forward as Attachment 1 and Attachment 6 has been split into
two separate attachments (Attachment 7 and Attachment 8), with all subsequent attachments being
renumbered to reflect this change. Figures and paragraphs have been renumbered in according to digital
publication standards. The text of the publication is unchanged, except for updating numeric references
to reflect numbering changes. All changes were accomplished to ensure format standardization IAW AFI
33-360V1, Publications Management Program, and requirements for Standard Graphics Markup Lan-
guage (SGML) processing. Previous edition can still be used.

    1.2. Introduction. AFSOC is a term which refers to the Air Force special operations component of a
    unified or subordinate unified command or Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF). An
    AFSOC is not a standing organization, but is formed in response to a contingency or operation. When
    an AFSOC is formed, it is normally named based on the theater of operation (AFSOCACOM,
    AFSOCCENT, AFSOCSOUTH, and so forth). For the purposes of this document, AFSOC will
    always refer to the theater Air Force special operations component, and not HQ AFSOC. The 16
    SOW is responsible for establishing and operating an AFSOC in three theaters, and supporting
    AFSOC operations in two other theaters. In those theaters where the 16 SOW is responsible for oper-
    ating the AFSOC, the 16 SOW Commander, or his representative, is normally designated the Com-
    mander AFSOC (COMAFSOC). When joint special operations forces (SOF) aviation assets are
    assigned to the theater, the SOF Service component commander with the preponderance of assets and
    the means to control the assets is normally designated the Joint Special Operations Air Component
    Commander (JSOACC). The JSOACC is responsible for planning and executing joint special air
    operations and for coordinating and deconflicting those operations with conventional air operations.
    The AFSOC staff must be prepared to assume responsibilities for planning and conducting operations
    in support of the JSOACC. This instruction is based on the most demanding 16 SOW tasking, but can
    be modified to meet any contingency or exercise requirement.
    1.3. Application. These procedures apply to all forces assigned to the Commander, 16 SOW, and all
    forces which augment the AFSOC when either Change of Operational Control (CHOP) or Tactical
    Control (TACON) has been directed to COMAFSOC by appropriate authority. These may be either
    Air Force or joint special operations aviation forces.
    Air Force Special Operations Component (AFSOC). When directed, 16 SOW will establish an
    AFSOC formed from 16 SOW and augmenting special operations aviation and special tactics forces
    tailored to conduct missions delineated in Operation Plans (OPLANs), Exercise Plans (EXPLANs), or
    Operational Orders (OPORDs). The AFSOC is normally commanded by the Commander, 16 SOW,
    or his designated representative. Additionally, COMAFSOC may also be designated the JSOACC
    aligned under a Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF). In addition to joint US special opera-
    tions aviation, the Joint Special Operations Air Component (JSOAC) may also include aviation forces
    from other nations assigned or attached, transitioning from a "Joint" to a "Combined" organization, or
    a Combined Special Operation Air Component (CSOAC). Elements of the 16th Operations Support
    Squadron (OSS) will form the core of COMAFSOC’s combat operations staff, augmented by 16 SOW
    staff, 16th Logistics Group, 16th Support Group, 16th Medical Group and operational squadron per-
    sonnel. This combat operations staff provides the operational planning; theater coordination and
    deconfliction; and command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C41) support
    necessary to successfully execute assigned missions.
    1.4. Liaison Officers (LNO) Requirements. The AFSOC will provide LNOs to lateral headquarters
    (Army and Navy SOF counterparts) when required to ensure effective integration of special opera-
    tions aviation and special tactics personnel into the overall campaign plan and deconfliction with con-
 5 APRIL 1996                                                                                         7

   ventional air and ground forces. IAW AFSOCR 28-2 (HQ AFSOC), theater Special Operations
   Commands (SOC), should request theater LNO staffing assistance (special operations liaison element
   {9AATA} and theater SOC augmentation package {9AASA}) from HQ AFSOC through USSO-
   COM. Normally, LNOs are required at the joint or combined special operations task force headquar-
   ters and the Joint Force Air Component Command (JFACC). LNOs must have a thorough
   understanding of AFSOC capabilities and ready access to secure communications with the AFSOC
   staff. LNOs assigned to the JFACC, or its combined equivalent, should have a working knowledge of
   CTAPS (Contingency Theater Automated Planning System) and the Air Tasking Order (ATO) process
   to cfti2ctively deconflict and integrate AFSOC operations with conventional air forces.
   1.5. Mission. On order, 16 SOW will mobilize and deploy a tailored combat operations staff, tasked
   aviation forces, and support personnel, to form a theater AFSOC which is prepared to conduct
   assigned missions.
   1.6. Concept of Operations. The AFSOC may be tasked to support or execute any of the principal
   special operations missions and/or the collateral missions.
   1.7. Operational Security (OPSEC) and Communications Security (COM SEC). Strict OPSEC
   and COMSEC procedures must be followed by all echelons in the AFSOC organization. STU III
   (Secure Telephone Unit) telephones will be used in the secure mode to the maximum extent possible.
   Operations and intelligence information will be disseminated to the minimum number of personnel
   necessary to accomplish the assigned tasks. Frequently, information will be compartmented to protect
   sources and planned or current operations.
   1.8. Continuity Folders. All functional managers will develop supporting continuity folders and
   checklists. Continuity folders and checklists will be reviewed and updated semi-annually.
   1.9. Changes. Recommendations for changes to this Instruction are encouraged. Please send sug-
   gested changes to 16 OSS/DOX (Plans), 215 Bennett Ave., Hurlburt Field, FL. 32544-5735.

2. Command Relationships
   2.1. General. A typical command relationship wiring diagram for SOF is found in Figure 1. Refer to
   the referenced publications for specific guidance. For deployed operations and exercises, specific
   command relationships will be detailed in the governing OPLANs, OPORDs, or EXPLANs. Several
   SOF aircraft have a multi-role capability and therefore can be tasked to support other theater compo-
   nent commanders. As examples, AC-130s may support theater Air Force operations, and EC-130s
   may support theater Army operations. Ideally, all SOF aviation assets should remain under the control
   of the JFSOCC and made available to other component commanders on as available basis. Actual
   command and control arrangements should agree with joint and Air Force doctrine and should be
   clearly explained in OPLANs, OPORDs, and EXPLANs.

3. Command Staff
    3.1. General. The AFSOC includes all assigned and attached aviation forces, special tactics person-
    nel tasked to conduct anticipated mission requirements, C41 staff and liaison personnel necessary to
    support mission planning and execution. Depending on force size and beddown location(s), 16 SOW
    may be tasked to form an AFSOC and one or more Air Force Special Operations Detachments
    (AFSOD) or Air Force Special Operations Elements (AFSOE). See Attachment 3 for guidance on
    AFSOD and AFSOE operations. Headquarters and C41 staff functions may be tasked under any or all
    of the following Unit Type Codes (UTC): 9AAHQ (AFSOC), 9AAHD (AFSOD), 9AAH3 (AC-130
    H and/or U staff augmentation), 9AAH4 (MH-53 staff augmentation), 9AAH5 ((MC-130 E and/or H
5 APRIL 1996                                                                                            9

 staff augmentation), 9AAH7 (HC-130 staff augmentation), 9AAH8 (MH-60 staff augmentation),
 appropriate combat air advisory augmentation (6 SOS augmentation UTC to be developed), 6AASF
 (AFSOE comm augmentation), 6AASL (LNO comm augmentation). Additionally, for STS planning
 expertise, 9AAH6 (SOF Special Tactics AFSOC Augmentation) can be requested from the 720 STG.
 9AAH3-9AAH8 are weapons system/ST-unique UTCs and contain weapon system-unique planning
 expertise. They should be tasked/requested anytime these assets are employed and can be tailored to
 meet anticipated requirements. The resulting organization will be comprised of the commander and
 some or all of the following: deputy commander, special staff; operations squadron(s) and associated
 maintenance elements (to include elements of special operations aviation forces from other US Ser-
 vices and other nations), and a special operations air staff organized along traditional staff lines (A-1
 through A-6 {A-7 when Special Tactics is aligned under COMAFSOC}). AFSODs and AFSOEs will
 be organized to mirror the AFSOC organization on a smaller scale. Figure 2 shows a typical AFSOC
 organizational wiring diagram.
10                                                                                            5 APRIL 1996

        bility at deployed location(s). Develops pre, trans, and post-attack notification and reporting com-
        munication procedures, using all available resources, that facilitate command and control
        throughout the attack conditions. Ensures post-attack assessment teams (PAAT) are identified for
        each work area and billet. Trains PAAT members in damage assessment procedures and ensures
        necessary biological and chemical agent detection equipment is available. Maintains a close liai-
        son with A-2 and keeps COMAFSOC informed of attack conditions and status of personnel. Rec-
        ommends appropriate mission oriented protective posture (MOPP) levels.

        threats and precautions. Works closely with A-2 to support special planning considerations such
        as search and rescue and evasion and recovery planning.

4. Personnel and Administration (A-1).
     4.1. General. The A-1 staff provides all administrative support for COMAFSOC and is the central
     controlling agency for incoming and outgoing correspondence. The A-1 also provides personnel
     accountability actions and status when a PERSCO team is not available at the deployed location(s).
     The Chief of the PERSCO team is on the Commander’s Special Staff; however, the PERSCO team is
     administratively aligned under the A-1. Specific A-1 duties and responsibilities are listed below.
     4.2. Duties and Responsibilities. Although specific requirements for each deployment may vary,
     Attachment 4 provides a general listing of’ duties performed by A-1 personnel during 24-hour opera-
     tions. Some duties may overlap shifts and others are common to both shifts. The Commander’s
     SITREP is a shared responsibility between Command Post and the A-1. Command Post will collect
     inputs from A-2 through A-6 and pass them to the A-1. The A-1 will collect inputs from the A-1 staff
 5 APRIL 1996                                                                                           13

   including PERSCO, the Special Staff, and COMAFSOC. These inputs will then be consolidated with
   inputs from Command Post. The A-1 is responsible for the SITREP’s final consolidation, its prepara-
   tion, and processing. See Attachment 5 or Joint Pub 3-05.3 for a typical SITREP message. COMA-
   FSOC will determine the SITREP cutoff time and transmission time based on COMJSOTF
   requirements. Based on these times, A-1 will establish and announce a no later than time for staff
   inputs to the SITREP.
       4.2.1. Predeployment. The designated senior information management specialist ensures all nec-
       essary automated data processing equipment (ADPE), shredders, safes, photocopiers, forms, and
       office supplies are properly crated and prepared for air shipment (Consider the equipment avail-
       able at the deployed location, either government equipment or contractor provided, and the antic-
       ipated duration of deployment). All computers must be loaded with the AFSOC standard for
       software and operating systems. Additionally, ensure appropriate message processing software is
       loaded on each computer (Sarah-Lite and/or MTF Editor). Ensure back-up copies of the software
       are available at the deployed location(s) in the event of hard drive malfunctions. Ensure sufficient
       floppy disks are available to store all data files produced during the deployment. Do not store data
       files on the computer hard drives, regardless of file classification.
       4.2.2. Arrival at the Deployed Site. The A-1 reports to Commander through the staff director.
       The A-1 ensures the work center is established and that all assigned personnel are familiar with
       their duties and responsibilities. Separate message log folders will be established for incoming,
       outgoing, and SITREP traffic pertaining to the contingency/deployment, as well as other message
       and fax correspondence not related to the tasked operation.
       4.2.3. Redeployment. The A-1 ensures all equipment and supplies are packed and prepared for
       air shipment. Extreme care must be taken to maintain positive control of all classified information
       returning to home station. The amount of classified information should be kept to a minimum and
       properly marked.
   4.3. Equipment Custodial Duties. The A-1, or the senior information management specialist when
   no A-1 is designated, will be designated the Equipment Custodian for the 9AAHQ or 9AAHD equip-
   ment package.
       4.3.1. Initial Deployment. The Equipment Custodian will report to the 16 OSS/DOXM ware-
       house (Building 90628) to conduct a physical inventory of all equipment deploying in support of
       the 9AAHQ or 9AAHD UTC. The custodian will sign tot, and be responsible for all equipment
       until the completion of the deployment, or until a swap-out of personnel occurs. This individual
       will also conduct the responsibilities outlined in paragraph 4.2.
       4.3.2. Personnel Swap-Out. Individuals designated to replace deployed equipment custodians
       will report to 16 OSS/DOXM warehouse to receive a briefing on the procedures for taking respon-
       sibility of equipment at the deployed location. Once at the deployed location, the new custodian
       will conduct an inventory and sign for the equipment list.
       4.3.3. Redeployment. After the equipment pallet is returned to the 16 OSS/DOXM warehouse,
       the equipment custodian will conduct a physical inventory and sign the list over to 16 OSS/
       DOXM.

    described in paragraph 14., Ability to Survive and Operate.
       6.3.2.1. Joint liaison Officers. Represents the interests of another service commander at any
       level. Is the direct liaison between the AFSOC and the liaison’s headquarters. Provides
       unique planning expertise. Advises A-3 and Chief of Combat Plans on projected mission
       requirements and coordinates real-time support for current and planned operations.
       6.3.2.2. Mission Coordinators (Combat Plans staff personnel). Support Chief of Combat
       Plans and Chief of Combat Operations as directed. These personnel are part of the A-3 Com-
       bat Plans Staff and are normally evaluator or instructor qualified. These personnel should not
       be confused with Squadron Mission Commanders who are not assigned to the AFSOC. Mis-
       sion Coordinators are responsible for orchestrating mission packages. A mission package can
       range from a single infiltration platform to several aircraft supporting a specific objective.
       They provide MITASK or Mission Support Request (MSR) data to Weapon System Managers
       and Planners to prepare aircrew inbrief. They maintain the master record of all coordination
       with outside agencies. Mission Coordinators attend the aircrew backbrief and maintain a
       working knowledge of each mission, particularly planned aircrew intentions in the event of
       mission deviations due to maintenance delays, weather diverts, no-drops, missed helo rendez-
       vous, and emergencies created by unforeseen hostile fire and battle damage. Coordinate with
       the SOLE for conventional support, such as refueling or airlift, SEAD, planned CAS, and so
       forth. These requirements are normally coordinated by mission planners in the ALLOREQ.
       See Attachment 9 for ALLOREQ format. Mission Coordinators monitor the mission from
       tasking through execution. They work closely with Weapon System Managers and planners,
       but normally do not get involved in detailed mission planning.

     6.3.2.3. Weapon System Manager and Planners. These individuals normally come from the
     aircraft augmentation UTCs. The senior planner is designated the Weapon System Manager.
     These planners are the interface between the AFSOC staff and the aircrews. Normally, one
     planner will be assigned to one or more aircrews at a time. Set up the aircrew mission plan-
     ning area(s) and ensure all required mission planning aids (en route charts, IFR (Instrument
     Flight Rules) supplements, Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs), approach plates) are available. Aid
     in the apportionment and mission assessment process by reviewing assault zones, conducting
     preliminary flight planning and identifying critical SEAD requirements. Assist and support
     the aircrews in mission planning and coordinates any required deviations to the MSR with the
     Mission Coordinator. Completes the MSC worksheet and submits it to Combat Plans. See
     Attachment 9 for the standard MSC format. Coordinates airspace requirements and decon-
     flicts mission with other AFSOC or JSOAC aircraft through the Airspace Manager. Provides
     all data for inclusion in the ALLOREQ. Normally only coordinates with lateral agencies and
     leaves higher headquarters coordination to the Mission Coordinator. Mission planners are nor-
     mally not responsible for specific aircrew planning, but facilitate planning and coordination
     for the aircrew. However, in time critical situations, weapon system planners may be required
     to do some aircrew planning. All planners will assist the Mission Coordinators in their
     assigned duties. Weapon System Managers will be in the Tactical Operations Center (TOC)
     during mission execution to advise the Commander or A3 of crew responses to mission devia-
     tions.
     6.3.2.4. Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) Operations. Combat Plans, in coordination with
     Special Tactics Planners/LNO(s), is responsible for planning all known CSAR requirements.
     Once mission execution begins, responsibility for CSAR operations transti2rs to Combat
     Operations and is normally executed from the CSAR Coordination Cell.
        6.3.2.4.1. COMAFSOC is responsible for all operations involving the contingency search,
        rescue, and recovery of special operations personnel, equipment, and precious cargo dur-
        ing all AFSOC exercise and combat operations. COMAFSOC may also be tasked to plan
        and conduct CSAR operations in support of the JSOTF, JTF, or another Service compo-
        nent. In the prosecution of a CSAR effort, COMAFSOC may choose to rely solely upon
        organic forces, or if the situation exceeds the capability of AFSOC forces available, may
        request additional support through an established Joint Search and Rescue Center (JSRC).
        COMAFSOC is the final approval authority for CSAR plans and minimum force determi-
        nation in support of AFSOC operations.
        6.3.2.4.2. CSAR Planning and Mission Management. When aligned under COMAFSOC,
        Special Tactics is the primary proponent for CSAR planning, coordination, and mission
        management within the AFSOC. ST serves as primary advisor to COMAFSOC and the
        A3 for the planning and integration of CSAR operations executed in support of special
        operations aviation as well as those CSAR efforts outside the SOF mission profile tasked
        to AFSOC by higher authority. During the normal mission planning cycle, ST personnel
        will accomplish the following CSAR-related tasks:
            6.3.2.4.2.1. Direct the efforts of AFSOC Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) to ensure
            complete integration of the deliberate CSAR planning process, taking into account
            such factors as: asset capabilities and limitations, mission requirements, operational
            environment, enemy threat, etc.
5 APRIL 1996                                                                                        17

               6.3.2.4.2.2. Coordinate with the A2 staff on data collection for CSAR target folders to
               include compilation of EPAs, ISOPREP info, E&R plans, SPINS, etc.
               6.3.2.4.2.3. Advise COMAFSOC and the A3 on the adequacy of CSAR coverage for
               planned SOF mission profiles and externally tasked missions, as well as recommend
               CSAR priorities IAW mission analysis considerations.
               6.3.2.4.2.4. Provide COMAFSOC with specially trained and equipped CSAR Special
               Tactics Teams to facilitate the location, medical treatment, and recovery of isolated/
               injured personnel and equipment, as well as the sanitization and emergency destruction
               of sensitive equipment items or downed aircraft.
               6.3.2.4.2.5. Provide CSAR planners to SOF ground force elements to facilitate the
               integration of CSAR considerations into the ground commander’s tactical plan and air-
               lift support requirements.
       6.3.2.5. Staff EWO. Provides an interface between A-2 and aircrew planners. Assists air-
       crews during mission planning in threat analysis, route construction, and preparation of SEAD
       requests, when required. Prepares any SEAD requirements for inclusion into the ALLOREQ.
       Advises COMAFSOC and aircrews on status of requested SEAD prior to launch. Provides
       interface with maintenance for PACER WARE/SERENE BYTE message updates.
       6.3.2.6. Staff Weapons and Tactics. Provides interface between A-2 and aircrew planners.
       Assists aircrews in mission planning threat analysis, route construction, and preparation of
       SEAD requests, when required. Provides support to A-2 for weapons and tactics issues.
       Advises COMAFSOC and aircrews on status of requested SEAD prior to mission launch.
       Serves as the focal point for landing zone (LZ) and Drop Zone (DZ) Surveys.
       6.3.2.7. Aerial Delivery Support (ADS) Flight. Assists in download and upload of organic
       aircraft. Builds, uploads, and recovers airdrop training loads. Provides Joint Airdrop Inspec-
       tion (JAI) qualified personnel for training missions. Works closely with A-4 (Logistics) per-
       sonnel during the deployment and redeployment phases of the operation.
       6.3.2.8. Airspace Management. Primary focal point for coordinating and deconflicting all
       SOF airspace requirements during operational contingencies and exercises. Assists the
       JFACC or the designated Airspace Control Authority (ACA) in coordinating and integrating
       special operations use of airspace within the combat zone or exercise area. Airspace Managers
       arc an essential part of the operational and exercise planning process and should be included in
       all facets of mission preparation and planning to ensure airspace requirements are met and
       shortfalls are identified.
          6.3.2.8.1. When the circumstances of a contingency dictate the rapid deployment and
          employment of forces for situations where there is no established Airspace Control Plan,
          Combat Airspace Managers will develop a temporary airspace control system for COMA-
          FSOC.
          6.3.2.8.2. Airspace Deconfliction. Normally accomplished by the SOF Airspace Man-
          ager. When an Airspace Manager is not deployed, deconfliction requirements listed below
          will normally be accomplished by mission managers and planners. Airspace deconfliction
          within the SOF community is completed in two phases, internal (SOF vs SOF deconflic-
          tion), and integrated (SOF vs conventional deconfliction). Airspace deconfliction, integra-
18                                                                               5 APRIL 1996

     tion into the ATO, and inclusion in the Airspace Control Order (ACO), are the primary
     means for preventing fratricide. Close coordination between Airspace Managers, Mission
     Planners, Aircrews, host nation, local air traffic control authorities, and elements within
     the JFACC’s headquarters is essential to minimize risk and enhance mission effectiveness.
        6.3.2.8.2.1. Internal Airspace Deconfliction. Mission managers or planners will sub-
        mit a completed ACMREQ to the Airspace Manager for all missions prior to the desig-
        nated cutoff time. Cutoff time will be determined by the Airspace Manager based on
        ATO timelines and the extent of theater and host nation coordination required. See
        Attachment 9 for Airspace Control Measure Request (ACMREQ) standard format.
        Using the ACMREQ, the Airspace Manager internally deconflicts all assigned and
        attached SOF mission aircraft from each other prior to finalized aircrew planning.
        Advises mission planners of options available to alleviate conflicts including timing,
        route, or altitude adjustments. COMAFSOC, or the designated representative, will be
        briefed on all known conflicts prior to final aircrew briefings.
        6.3.2.8.2.2. Integrated Airspace Deconfliction. Airspace Manager forwards the com-
        pleted internal ACMREQ to the JFACC for integration into the ACO. Based on the
        scale of the operation or exercise and staffing at the AOC, the ACMREQ is sent to
        either the SOF Airspace Manager in the SOLE, or directly to the AOC Combat Plans
        Division Airspace Management Cell. These agencies then take action to ensure SOF
        missions are deconflicted with all other scheduled missions and integrated into the
        ACO. It’ AOC Combat Plans identifies a conflict or changes the SOF mission profile
        they will coordinate with the point or’ contact listed on the ACMREQ to work out
        changes. Once the ATO is published, Airspace Managers and Mission Coordinators
        are responsible for ensuring all ACMREQ submitted are included in the ACO. If an
        ACMREQ fails to make the ACO, immediate coordination with the SOLE/AOC Com-
        bat Operations Division is required for real-time integration into the air control system.
        Similar real-time coordination may be required in the event of unscheduled mission
        taskings or previously scheduled missions deviating due to maintenance delays,
        weather diverts, additional taskings, no-drops, missed rendezvous, and other emergen-
        cies.
     6.3.2.8.3. Deployed SOF Airspace Management Duties. In addition to deconfliction/
     ACO integration, the SOF Airspace Manager will also:
        6.3.2.8.3.1. Provide Air Traffic Control and airspace mission briefings to COMAF-
        SOC and aircrews.
        6.3.2.8.3.2. Coordinate with local and host nation air traffic control agencies.
        6.3.2.8.3.3. Assess local and host nation air traffic control capability to support SOF
        operations and advise SOF planners of shortfalls and recommend possible solutions.
        6.3.2.8.3.4. Provide liaison representation to other Service/component airspace con-
        trol facilities.
        6.3.2.8.3.5. Review aircraft mishaps and hazardous air traffic reports (HATR) that are
        of concern to special operations. Provide COMAFSOC with an analysis of ATC fac-
        tors involved.
 5 APRIL 1996                                                                                         19

          6.3.2.9. Medical Operations. Provides medical operational planning which includes prepara-
          tion for casualty evacuation aboard mission aircraft.
       6.3.3. Chief of Combat Operations. Chief of Combat Operations is normally the 16 OSS Chief of
       Current Operations, but may be a squadron level current operator depending on the scope and
       duration of the operation. Combat Operations is comprised of the operations center, tactical oper-
       ations center (TOC), weather element, and the command post. Combat Operations also is respon-
       sible for the coordination and support of the RCC, if required.
          6.3.3.1. Operations Center. Picks-up control of missions from combat plans upon completion
          of the MSC message, the ALLOREQ, and the Aircrew Backbrief. Is primarily concerned with
          operations planned for the current day. Reviews and distributes published copies of the ATO/
          ITO to Weapon System Managers and Planners. Coordinates aircraft landing requests at other
          airfields. Prepares daily flying schedules. Maintains the master planning folder for each mis-
          sion containing all information produced by the Mission Coordinator and Weapon System
          Managers and Planners. Coordinates final required changes to the MSC with appropriate
          planning agencies and ALLOREQ inputs with the SOLE. Where necessary, coordinates air-
          field schedules with host base or provisional wing agencies.

NOTE:
For smaller contingencies or operations, Combat Plans and Combat Operations may be consolidated into
a single mission control function.
              6.3.3.1.1. Staff Duty Officers. Maintain operational perspective of current operations.
              Coordinates required changes to the MSC or inputs to the SOLE. Coordinates mission
              requirements prior to takeoff with mission coordinators and planners, the SOLE, and the
              JFACC. Assists Chief of Combat Operations in all assigned duties. Normally handles all
              requirements prior to mission execution. Ensures post-mission reports and aircrew
              debriefs are collected immediately after aircrew debrief for the A-3’s review and inclusion
              in the Commander’s SITREP.
              6.3.3.1.2. Operations Resource Management Specialists. Assists the mission managers
              and planners in all duties. Keeps status boards (either electronically generated or grease
              boards) updated with the most current information. Distributes approved flying schedules
              to internal agencies (COMAFSOC, staff director, maintenance, intelligence, security,
              operations elements).
          6.3.3.2. Weather Element. The Weather Element is administratively aligned under Combat
          Operations, but they have a dual responsibility to the COMAFSOC. The Element coordinates
          personnel and equipment deployment requirements and operations facility requirements at
          deployed location(s) with exercise or contingency operations and logistics planners in the 16
          OSS/DOX. Provides climatological data to mission planners throughout the planning cycle.
          Briefs aircrews at designated times prior to each mission and ensures personnel remain on
          duty through mission execution to provide updated conditions and forecasts for returning air-
          crews. Keeps the commander informed of current and forecast meteorological conditions that
          could adversely impact mission accomplishments. Provides daily input to the Commander’s
          SITREP.
          6.3.3.3. Tactical Operations Center (TOC). The TOC tracks mission execution and coordi-
20                                                                                   5 APRIL 1996

     nates real time mission requirements. The TOC will be located in close proximity to A-6
     Operations and the Command Post. Each Weapon System will be represented by the Squad-
     ron Operations Officer, Weapon System Manager, or a designated representative. Personnel
     monitor their portion of the execution checklist and coordinate real time requirements with the
     A-3, or his designated representative. During personnel recovery or CSAR operations, Special
     Tactics planners/LNO(s) will be present in the TOC. The Chief of Combat Operations ensures
     that the execution checklist is prominently displayed in the TOC. The A-6 ensures the TOC
     can fully monitor all external aircraft communications. A separate communications console
     should be available to support the TOC.
     6.3.3.4. CSAR Coordination Cell. The AFSOC A3 will normally designate a CSAR Coordi-
     nation Cell to act as the primary focal point for CSAR mission management in its execution
     phase. The CSAR Coordination Cell will consist of Special Tactics planners/LNO(s) or an
     aviator with CSAR experience, as designated by the A3. The CSAR Coordination Cell will
     form an integral part of the TOC. The CSAR Coordination Cell assumes responsibility for the
     following actions in the event of an organic mishap or externally tasked CSAR operation:
        6.3.3.4.1. Makes recommendations to COMAFSOC/A3 concerning CSAR priorities,
        asset availability/suitability, command and control, etc., and directs the overall CSAR inci-
        dent response.
        6.3.3.4.2. Coordinates with A2/A3 staff to confirm pertinent survivor information (i.e.
        type aircraft, number of pax on board, tactical call sign, last known position, survival
        equipment on board, PLS codes, evasion plan of action of personnel in distress, etc.).
        6.3.3.4.3. Coordinates with TOC weapons system managers to ascertain CSAR aviation
        asset capabilities and limitations, response times, internal configurations, refueling
        requirements, loiter time available, etc.
        6.3.3.4.4. Manages designated CSAR radio communications nets. For planned CSAR
        operations, the A-6 should ensure that a separate communications console is made avail-
        able.
        6.3.3.4.5. Manages the flow of information and directs CSAR aviation assets to and from
        the incident site in concert with the designated air mission commander/on-scene CSAR
        commander.
        6.3.3.4.6. Advises COMAFSOC and the A3 on mission support requirements and mission
        progress.
        6.3.3.4.7. Coordinates with established RCC/JSRC to request assistance from other com-
        ponent CSAR forces and/or civilian authorities as required. See Attachment 10 for CSAR
        Planning Documents.
     6.3.3.5. Command Post. Along with the TOC, tracks mission execution and coordinates real
     time mission requirements. Also serves as COMAFSOC’s coordination element to manage,
     among other issues, transportation, aircraft movement, key personnel location, headquarters/
     staff land mobile radio (LMR) communications and emergency response information nets.
     Focal point for collecting and compiling information from A-2 through A-6 for the Com-
     mander’s SITREP. (See Attachment 5 or Joint Pub 3-05.3 for a typical SITREP message.)
     Develops crisis response checklists and initiates the appropriate checklist for any given crisis
5 APRIL 1996                                                                                           21

        situation. Collects required data for BEELINE, HOMELINE, and Operational Report
        (OPREP) reporting and any other reports required based on the situation. Reviews all reports
        for accuracy prior to the commander’s release. Maintains contact with the 16 SOW Command
        Post and the HQ AFSOC Command Center (Hurlburt Field, FL), requesting assistance when
        necessary.
 6.4. Status Boards (Manual or Electronic Display). The following status boards should be dis-
 played prominently in the AFSOC headquarters and posted with the most current information. Addi-
 tional information may be displayed if directed by the commander or staff director. Status boards
 should be maintained by Operations Center and Command Post Personnel. The Flying Schedule is
 the official source for flying information. Weapon Systems Managers will provide the information to
 the Operations Center and ensure accuracy of all mission information.
    6.4.1. Flying Schedule
    6.4.2. Alert/MOPP Status
    6.4.3. Aircraft Maintenance Status
    6.4.4. STT (Special Tactics Team) Status by Team Number
    6.4.5. Execution Checklist (during flying operations)
    6.4.6. Vehicle Control Board
    6.4.7. Key Personnel Locator
 6.5. Mission Planning Process. Doctrinally, SOF mission planning is normally based on an inten-
 sive 96 hour planning cycle. Realistically, aircrews generally have less time to complete the planning
 process, therefore weapons systems managers and planners must be prepared to conduct some initial
 mission planning. The sequence of events remains constant but the time available to complete the
 cycle prior to aircrews entering pre-mission crew rest usually dictates the thoroughness of the mission
 plan. The following is a basic guide to the planning cycle and actions accomplished at each step.
 Times specified are normally in hours prior to EALT (Earliest Anticipated Launch Time) and will vary
 due to the dynamic combat situation. In this instruction, times are administratively based on 1800L
 the night of execution. Historically, in large joint and combined exercises, administratively setting the
 base time at 1800L facilitates tracking mission planning. Attachment 6 has a chart that shows the 96
 hour mission planning process and the integration of the SOF planning cycle with the JFACC A/ITO
 planning cycle.
    6.5.1. 96 Hours. The MITASK is transmitted from the SOC/JSOTF to the MPA (Mission Plan-
    ning Agency), with the MSA (Mission Support Agency) receiving an info copy. At this point, the
    A-3 and combat plans (including joint liaison representatives) begin tracking the mission. Figure
    3 depicts the SOF mission message flow.
    6.5.2. 72 Hours. The AFSOC receives the MSR from the MPA. The AFSOC conducts an initial
    mission assessment and missions are allocated to the best suited weapon systems. A Mission
    Coordinator is assigned and mission planning data is passed to weapon system managers. If the
    aircrews are available they will be inbriefed on information specified in the MSR. Inbrief includes
    expected weather and an intelligence overview; which includes estimated enemy capabilities and
    current or projected orders of battle. Weapon system planners or aircrew (depending on availabil-
    ity), begin route construction and objective area study, develop intelligence requests for informa-
22                                                                                        5 APRIL 1996

      tion not available during the inbrief, determine SOF and conventional support requirements
      (SEAD, air refueling, CAS, airlift, and so forth), and determine mission feasibility and probability
      of’ success.

Figure 3. SOF Mission Message Flow.




      6.5.3. 48 Hours (36 Hours before ATO execution) (1800L). Initial flight plans are completed,
      deconflicted with other AFSOC missions and adjustments made as necessary. Emergency proce-
      dures and evasion and recovery (E&R) plans are developed. Finalize take off time and time over
      target. Complete MSC for transmittal to the requesting agency after coordinating all changes to
      the MSR; however, this may occur as late as 36 hours due to mission planning constraints. A/ITO
      inputs arc due to the SOLE at the JFACC.
      6.5.4. 48 Hours. MSC must be to the MPA. Depending on time requirements, this may occurs as
      late as 36 Hours. However, it needs to be accomplished as soon as possible to determine rehearsal
      or other mission planning requirements.
      6.5.5. Approximately 24 Hours (12 Hours prior to ATO execution) (1800L) the A/ITO is pub-
      lished. Combat Operations and Weapon System Managers and Planners must review to ensure
      required support has been included. Mission Coordinators should be notified in the event of any
      deviations.
 5 APRIL 1996                                                                                         23

     6.5.6. Approximately 20 Hours. Aircrew finalizes the mission plan and conducts a backbrief of
     all aspects of the mission to the squadron commander or his designated representative, including
     the E&R plan, adverse weather intentions, emergency landing bases/zones, and any back-up plans
     that enhance mission accomplishment. Briefing concludes with an aircrew assessment of the
     probability of mission success, taking into account all factors that may impact the mission. The
     A-3 and COMA FSOC must be notified anytime there is question about the likelihood of success.
     COMAFSOC retains final approval authority. Mission execution is directed by higher headquar-
     ters upon receipt of mission concept approval.
     6.5.7. Aircrew Show Time. To be determined by length of mission, complexity, or remaining
     planning/coordination requirements. Aircrew receives a weather briefing and intelligence update
     prior to launch.
     6.5.8. Throughout the history of SOF doctrine, the mission planning requirements (MITASK,
     MICON, MSR, MSC, MCA, etc.) have remained fairly consistent. In 1995, USCINCSOC
     decided to more closely align SOF lexicon with standard conventional terminology. The matrix at
     table 1, shows the new terminology. Personnel should be aware that there will be a transition
     period and should expect to see a combination of old and new terminology. Also, personnel
     should be aware that the different theaters of operation may use different terminology.

  6.6. Aircrew Briefings. There are normally three aircrew briefings prior to mission execution. These
  are the initial inbrief the aircrew backbrief, and the aircrew briefing. The Mission Coordinator is
  responsible for setting up the briefing rooms and notifying weather, intelligence, and joint liaisons.
  Weapons System Managers are responsible for notifying Squadron Commanders or their designated
  representatives on all briefing times and locations. Mission Coordinators will try to consolidate brief-
24                                                                                         5 APRIL 1996

     ing requirements and post briefing times and locations on the AFSOC briefing schedule. This infor-
     mation will be passed to the Staff Director prior to the COMAFSOC staff meeting. There are also
     several post mission debriefing and reporting requirements.
        6.6.1. Inbrief. Crews will receive an initial inbrief as soon as possible after weapon system allo-
        cation and the initial mission assessment is complete by Combat Plans. This briefing is normally
        provided by the Mission Coordinator. The briefing contains anticipated weather and current intel-
        ligence.
        6.6.2. Aircrew Backbrief. This briefing normally occurs between 24 and 20 hours prior to mis-
        sion execution. The briefing is given by the aircrew to the Squadron Commander or his desig-
        nated representative. The Mission Coordinators should attend to answer any overall mission
        questions. The A-3 and COMAFSOC must be notified anytime there is question about the likeli-
        hood of success. COMAFSOC retains final mission approval authority. This briefing will address
        the following areas:
            6.6.2.1. Overview.
            6.6.2.2. Weather.
            6.6.2.3. Intelligence.
            6.6.2.4. Concept of Operations.
            6.6.2.5. Enroute Threats/Electronic Warfare.
            6.6.2.6. Performance Considerations.
            6.6.2.7. Communications.
            6.6.2.8. Evasion Plan of Action.
            6.6.2.9. Mission Support Items.
            6.6.2.10. Go-No Go Criteria/What Ifs.
            6.6.2.11. Estimate of Mission Feasibility. Probability of mission success given in percentage
            (80%).
            6.6.2.12. Risk Assessment.
        6.6.3. Aircrew Briefing. This is the standard aircrew briefing. Briefing content is in accordance
        with applicable MAJCOM directives for the specific weapon system. This briefing is also nor-
        mally given to the Squadron Commander or his designated representative.
        6.6.4. Post Mission Debrief. Aircrew attends maintenance, operations, and intelligence debriefs,
        and completes the post-mission reports. The Weapon System Manager or planner provides inputs
        to combat operations for inputs into the Operations Summary (OPSUM). The OPSUM is submit-
        ted to the JFSOCC as soon as possible after the debriefing. The format is in Joint Pub 3-05.3,
        Annex E, and is in US Message Text Format (USMTF).
            6.6.4.1. Debriefng Process. Aircrews will complete their postflight duties as quickly as pos-
            sible after landing. Then the crews will be picked up by transportation and taken to a central-
            ized debriefing location. The area will be set up so that the crews will sit at a table and the
            debriefers will come to them in an assembly-line style. Intelligence will conduct the first
            debriefing to gather time-critical intelligence. Maintenance will be the next to debrief; fol-
5 APRIL 1996                                                                                           25

        lowed by Operations. Operations should be present during the other debriefings to prevent
        duplicate questions. Debriefers should review any inflight debriefing forms prior to actually
        debriefing the crews. If there is urgent intelligence information to pass to the A2, a crewmem-
        ber should be sent as soon as possible to the debriefing area and not wait on the rest of the crew
        to finish their post-flight duties.
 6.7. Mission Folders. Mission folders play a crucial role during the planning cycle. They are also
 important for historical purposes. Each operational mission will have its own folder. Folders must be
 kept up to date and the master copy maintained in the AFSOC headquarters at all times by either Com-
 bat Plans or Combat Operations. Normally, once combat plans has sent out both the MSC and the
 ALLOREQ, the Mission Coordinator transfers the mission folder to the Operations Center (Combat
 Operations). The folders will contain copies of all in-work and completed documentation relating to
 that particular mission, including the MSR, MSC, ALLOREQ, SEAD Worksheet, other conventional
 support coordination, low level flight plan, and a copy of the flight orders. The 6 part Mission Folder
 should be maintained as follows:
    6.7.1. Outside Cover. Mission Coordinator coordination sheet. Classification should be clearly
    marked on top and bottom.
    6.7.2. Inside Front Cover (section 1). 16 SOW Mission Setup Sheet.
    6.7.3. Front First Leaf (section 2). MITASK, MICON, MSR, followed by changes to MSR, and
    any other information about mission tasking, or concept.
    6.7.4. Back First Leaf (section 3). All outgoing correspondence relating to the mission (MSC,
    ALLOREQ, ACMREQ, SEAD request, and so forth).
    6.7.5. Front Second Leaf (section 4). All incoming approvals/confirmations, EXORDs, relating
    to the mission approval (MCA).
    6.7.6. Back Second Leaf (section 5). Copy of flight orders, Aircrew Briefing, Nav Log, and other
    pertinent planning data.
    6.7.7. Inside Back Cover (section 6). Post Mission Reports.
    6.7.8. Outside Back Cover. Classification clearly marked.
 6.8. 24 Hour Operations. Most duties described in paragraph 6.3. apply to both day and night shift
 personnel during 24 hour operations due to the continuous planning cycle. Higher headquarters sus-
 pense’s for reports will be specified in governing directives or orders which will determine the shift
 responsible for transmitting the reports. Generally, day shift conducts the stand-up briefing and the
 night shift flight follows missions during execution and transmits the SITREP upon mission comple-
 tion. See Attachment 5 for the standard SITREP format. Standardized procedures and clear, concise
 changeover briefings between shift counterparts are crucial to smooth operations. Due to the vast
 amount of information that must be coordinated with internal and external agencies, attention to detail
 in all correspondence cannot be overemphasized. Attachment 7 shows a typical 24 hour shift cycle
 for the A-3 staff.
 6.9. Forms Prescribed. See Attachment 9 for examples of standard AFSOC forms.
26                                                                                              5 APRIL 1996

        each aircraft. Develops maintains, and implements, when required, procedural checklists for
        emergency, disaster response, and emergency action requirements; serve as alternate operations
        command post should COMAFSOC’s command and control center be disabled. Requests support
        services, such as fire fighting, POL (Petroleum/Oil/Lubricants), AGE (Aerospace Ground Equip-
        ment), or control tower clearances for ground movement of aircraft and equipment. Provides air-
        craft tail numbers and parking locations for inclusion in the daily flying schedule. Is normally
        located in close proximity to the Command Post and the Operations Center.
        7.3.2. Aircraft Maintainers. Ensure deployed aircraft and equipment are safely operable, service-
        able, and properly configured to meet mission needs. Maintenance actions include, but are not
        limited to: operational inspection, repair, overhaul, modification, preservation, refurbishment,
        testing, and condition and performance analysis.
        7.3.3. Logistics Specialists. Implement beddown actions upon arrival at deployed location (s).

      and support of forces at deployed locations. Contract for vehicles, billeting, subsistence, rental
      equipment, and other required items. Ensure all contracting actions are completed in a timely
      manner prior to or immediately after redeployment.
   7.4. Base Operating Support (BOS). BOS is the responsibility of the theater Air Force component.
   In the absence or a provisional wing or host-base support at a deployed location, the A-4 is the func-
   tional coordinating authority for all BOS, to include billeting, messing, vehicles, AGE, and any other
   requirements identified by COMAFSOC.
   7.5. Air Lift Control Element (ALCE) Support. Provided by the theater Air Force for non-organic
   airlift.

8. Plans (A-5)
   8.1. General. Normally, deployments of known limited duration, such as exercises, will not require a
   separate A-5 staff function. When required, the A-5 will be staffed by individuals from both Opera-
   tions and Logistics Plans. During some exercises the A-5/exercise planner may also serve as a con-
   troller to keep the exercise on course. This position is normally tilled by 16 OSS/DOX.
   8.2. Mission. Plans theater deployment (movement to a FOB) and redeployment actions, identify tar-
   geting decisions, and assess future operational missions outside the time criteria for near term plan-
   ning conducted by the A-3.
   8.3. Duties and Responsibilities. When activated, the Chief of Plans (16 OSS/DOX) normally
   becomes chief of A-5 and is responsible for entering AFSOC planning information into the appropri-
   ate deliberate planning system.

9. Command and Control Communications (A-6)
   9.1. General. The A-6 division chief will be the senior communications officer/non-commissioned
   officer deployed. The A-6 will include all communications specialties required to establish and main-
   tain COMAFSOC’s command, control, and communications system.
28                                                                                          5 APRIL 1996

     9.2. Mission. Provide tactical communications equipment and personnel to support the AFSOC and
     its subordinate elements at deployed locations. Additionally, the A-6 may be tasked to support Com-
     mand, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4) links with the JSOTF, JTF (Joint Task Force),
     AOC (Air Operations Center), and/or the AFFOR (Air Force Forces).
     9.3. Duties and Responsibilities. Ensure all equipment and personnel are deployed and properly
     used to support the C4 operations and maintenance mission(s). In the absence of a deployed Provi-
     sional Wing, the A-6 will also establish a working relationship with and oversee the actions of the
     fixed-base communications personnel assigned to COMAFSOC.
     9.4. Execution Checklist. This is a fully integrated chronological list of every significant event/sta-
     tus check required during the execution or a given day/night operational cycle. Routinely, code words
     will be used to report by employed aircrews/STS personnel to COMAFSOC’s command, control and
     communications center. Normally A-6 works very closely with the A-3 Combat Plans and Combat
     Operations staffs to develop and run the execution checklist. The checklist provides COMAFSOC
     with real time information on ongoing operations and facilitates deconfliction as mission deviations
     occur. It is normally run in the tactical operations center (TOC) with the Weapon System Managers
     available to answer any questions.

10. Special Tactics (A-7)
     10.1. General. When assigned, the A-7 will normally be the senior Special Tactics representative
     deployed. The A-7 is the principle advisor to COMAFSOC on all theater Special Tactics issues and
     operational requirements.
     10.2. Mission. Advises COMAFSOC on the proper employment of theater Special Tactics forces.
     10.3. Duties and Responsibilities. Receives, prioritizes, and deconflicts all theater Special Tactics
     mission requirements. Closely coordinates with A-3 for proper integration and tasking of Special
     Tactics forces into theater SOF operations. Also, coordinates with appropriate theater agencies for the
     tasking and employment of Special Tactics forces to meet other theater airlift mission requirements.

11. Medical Support
     11.1. General. The medical support section will include, when available, a medical planner, flight
     surgeons, independent duty medical technicians, medical and aerospace medicine technicians, and
     medical logistics technicians.
     11.2. Mission. The mission is to provide a health care system focused on prevention of disease and
     illness while fostering quality, continuous, comprehensive, and accessible medical care. The task of
     medical personnel is to take care of the aircrew and support personnel by providing quality medical
     care whenever and wherever required. A medical planner is designated to identify specific medical
     support requirements and to facilitate medical logistics planning.
     11.3. Organizational Structure. When deployed, the AFSOC SMO will advise the Director, Base
     Medical Services (DBMS) on medical issues pertinent to base health and welfare. When a DBMS is
     not available, the AFSOC SMO will fill that position and assume those responsibilities (identified
     below). The SMO will report to the COMAFSOC as a Special Staff’ member. The medical operations
     personnel deploy as a Special Operations Forces Medical Element (SOFME) and will fall under the
     SMO for guidance and reporting. SOFME personnel (UTC FFQEK) located at the AFSOC main
     operating base will not be directly assigned to flying squadrons. A non standard UTC (FFZ99) may
 5 APRIL 1996                                                                                             29

   also be used at the time of plan execution for deployment of medical logistics and administrative per-
   sonnel to meet unique requirements.
   11.4. Duties and Responsibilities.
      11.4.1. SMO. The SMO is responsible for advising the COMAFSOC and, when necessary, func-
      tioning as the DBMS. In all circumstances, the SMO will perform the activities identified in para-
      graph 3.3.5. The SMO will also provide guidance to all assigned and transiting SOFME
      personnel.
      11.4.2. SOFME Personnel. SOFME personnel are responsible for providing direct medical care
      to aircrews and support personnel.
      11.4.3. Medical Planning. The medical planner is responsible for providing medical input to
      operations plans, identifying and facilitating medical logistics requirements, coordinating person-
      nel issues, and coordinating medical input to daily SITRF, Ps.

12. Operations Squadrons
   12.1. General. Operations squadrons, to include flying and ST (when aligned under COMAFSOC)
   will retain organizational integrity while deployed as operations elements of the AFSOC except for
   identified augmentation positions required to support AFSOC staff planning functions. The deployed
   squadron commander, or his designated representative, will manage his deployed personnel and be
   responsible to COMAFSOC.
   12.2. Mission. Plan and execute assigned missions. Provide planners to fill AFSOC augmentation
   UTCs to facilitate mission planning, deconfliction, and execution.
   12.3. Duties and Responsibilities. The operations elements will ensure deploying personnel are
   trained and qualified and all required equipment is available to conduct anticipated missions; will
   schedule aircrews or special tactics teams for assigned missions, will publish aircrew orders, track
   continuation training events and aircraft flying hours, and perform most other duties normally associ-
   ated with that unit as if operating from home station. Aircrew transportation will normally be sched-
   uled by the A-3 staff or command post representative.
   12.4. Life Support. A consolidated life support section will be established with specialists from each
   weapon system and will be assigned to A-3.

13. Short Notice Contingency Exercises/Operations
   13.1. General. These exercises/operations are of a short duration and with a specific and limited
   objective. Because of the fluidity of the operation it is imperative that the staff remain flexible. Addi-
   tionally, mission planning may be very compressed. Because of the uncertainty of the type and time
   of the mission, the aircrews will typically begin crew rest at the earliest time to enter a standby alert
   status. Under these circumstances weapons systems planners will be called upon to complete a great
   portion of mission planning prior to alerting aircrews. Ample time must be given from aircrew show
   time to take-off time for crew inbrief; a review and update of the mission plan; coordination with the
   supported agency; and attendance at any other mission briefings which may be required for successful
   accomplishment.
   13.2. Staff. Staff overhead should be streamlined with a mission controller responsible for coordinat-
   ing all weapons system planners and monitoring the planning process. The mission controller is
30                                                                                           5 APRIL 1996

     responsible for both the planning and operations functions outlined in paragraphs 6.3.2. and 6.3.3.
     Realize that tasking information will in all likelihood be verbal, as will the mission confirmation with
     hard copy to follow at a later time.

14. Ability to Survive and Operate
     14.1. General. The 16 SOW must be prepared to survive and sustain combat operations during peri-
     ods of imminent or actual hostile attack; including chemical, nuclear, biological, and conventional
     warfare. The wing must be prepared to survive an attack, recover casualties, and conserve the fighting
     force. Deploying personnel must be highly trained on individual protective actions, detection and
     warning, contamination avoidance, decontamination operations, and the ability to operate during and
     after hostile attacks. Additionally, 16 SOW must be prepared to implement appropriate terrorist
     actions IAW the Installation Security Plan. To the extent possible, disaster preparedness operations
     should be closely located to the unit’s command post and operations center.
        14.1.1. Individual Protective Actions. Personnel must be trained on protective equipment, CW
        antidotes, personnel decontamination kits, and response to alarm signals. They must also be pre-
        pared to take the appropriate rescue, buddy-care, and casualty evacuation actions.
            14.1.1.1. Personnel must be trained to detect, identify, and report chemical agents and mark
            contaminated areas. If required, personnel must also be prepared to decontaminate personnel,
            aircraft, and other equipment.
            14.1.1.2. If required, personnel must be prepared to operate in contaminated areas during
            blacked out conditions.
        14.1.2. Commanders must ensure their units are prepared to protect personnel and equipment
        from contamination.
     14.2. Attack Response. All functions must be prepared to survive an initial attack, account for its
     personnel, and then sustain operations.
        14.2.1. Each function must establish personnel accounting procedures which can be implemented
        after an attack. This normally consists of sign in/out procedures through an entry control point
        (ECP).
        14.2.2. The A3 normally ensures continuity of operations and designates a Response Officer (Re)
        to coordinate attack response preparation and post attack operations. The Re is normally the
        senior Combat Plans Officer. A suggested command arrangement for post attack operations is at
        Attachment 11. Integrated response options for geographically separated facilities and flight line
        operations must be thoroughly developed and well rehearsed prior to actual operations. The Re
        should consider organizing teams to assist in the post attack recovery. The key to team success is
        to build teams early in the deployment and exercise procedures prior to any attack. Each team
        needs to receive detailed training to be fully effective and safe. Most of the training should be
        done by the DP staff. Team options include:
            14.2.2.1. Disaster Preparedness Team. Prepares personnel for attack. Ensures personnel
            understand protective actions and comply with mission-oriented protective postures.
            14.2.2.2. Accountability Officer (may be the RO. Ensures all sections have accounted for
            personnel after Alarm Black or All Clear signal is given.
5 APRIL 1996                                                                                        31

        14.2.2.3. Post Attack Assessment Team (PAAT). Conducts sweep of outside facilities to
        check for unexploded ordinance (UXO) and possible contamination.
            14.2.2.3.1. All members should receive detailed UXO and contamination detection train-
            ing upon team formation.
        14.2.2.4. Casualty Collection Team. Team collects casualties using self aid/buddy care skills
        and moves them to a safe casualty collection point. This team should be composed of person-
        nel who have had some form of medical training. The Re should consider using Special Tac-
        tics Pararescue personnel if available. Care should be taken to prioritize injuries, and to not
        mix contaminated personnel with non contaminated personnel.
        14.2.2.5. Building Sweep Team. Should be used to ensure no UXOs are in the building and
        that personnel have been removed from potentially dangerous locations. Also used to ensure
        all personnel have evacuated when evacuation orders have been given.
 14.3. Civil Engineers (CE). Provides beddown, damage assessment, and recovery capabilities. Air-
 field Damage Assessment Teams (DATs) survey airfield runways and taxiways. Damage Response
 Teams (DARTs) assess and estimate repairs. FIX-IT and Utility Teams have the necessary supplies to
 make temporary repairs to infrastructure. Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) personnel neutralize
 UXOs. The Minimum Operating Strip (MOS) selection personnel provide COMAFSOC with the
 proposed MOS for approval. Once the MOS is selected, mat laying and crater teams begin the neces-
 sary repairs to the runway. Fire fighters provide crash response and fire fighting capabilities. The
 senior CE representative briefs COMAFSOC on all aspects of CE operations at the daily COMAF-
 SOC briefing.

Counterterrorism (CT)—Offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, and respond to terrorism."
Covert Operation—An operation that is so planned and executed as to conceal the identity of or permit
plausible deniability by the sponsor. A covert operation differs from a clandestine operation in that
emphasis is placed on the concealment of the identity of sponsor rather than on concealment of the
operation.
Direct Action—Short-duration strikes and other small-scale offensive actions by special operations
forces to seize, destroy, capture, recover, or inflict damage on designated personnel or materiel.
Foreign Internal Defense (FID)—Participation by civilian and military agencies of a government in any

                             ADVANCED ECHELON (ADVON) TEAM

A2.1. General. An ADVON team may be required at a location where 16 SOW has not previously con-
ducted a site survey. The ADVON team may also be required anytime 16 SOW/CC desires to front load
a deployment with supporting personnel to ensure the deployment base is prepared to receive 16 SOW
forces.
Mission. The ADVON will ensure deploying assets are efficiently bedded down and coordinate with host
base/nation agencies for anticipated requirements. Additionally, mission planners, including Special Tac-
tics planners/LNO(s), may be required to coordinate and plan anticipated mission requirements.

A2.2. Execution. When directed by 16 SOW/CC, the ADVON will depart to the deployed location.
   A2.2.1. The ADVON will depart on the first available means. If organic or military airlift is not
   available, the ADVON will be scheduled on commercial aircraft.
   A2.2.2. Each operation will have its own unique requirements. The ADVON should be tailored to
   the specific location and requirements of the operation. The following list has proven effective for
   past operations. Positions may be added or deleted depending on specific requirements. Functional
   managers should develop continuity folders in anticipation of ADVON requirements.

AIR FORCE SPECIAL OPERATIONS DETACHMENT/ELEMENT (AFSOD/E) OPERATIONS

A3.1. General. An Air Force Special Operations Detachment (AFSOD) is a squadron-size headquarters,
which could be a composite organization composed of different Air Force special operations assets. The
detachment is normally subordinate to a special operations component, such as an AFSOC, JSOTF, or
Joint Task Force, depending on the scope and duration of the operation.

A3.2. Command and Control. An AFSOD is normally under the command of COMAFSOC. When an
AFSOC is not assigned to the theater, the AFSOD will normally be under the control of the theater special
operations commander. AC-130 AFSOD. Actual command and control arrangements should be clearly
explained in OPLANs, OPORDs, and EXPLANs.

A3.3. Planning. When an AFSOD is assigned to an AFSOC, general planning will be done at the
AFSOC. The AFSOD will conduct all mission planning and reporting requirements through the AFSOC.
When there is no theater AFSOC, the AFSOD will conduct the same AFSOC requirements, but on a
smaller scale. AFSOC procedures and responsibilities outlined in this instruction should be tailored to
meet specific AFSOD requirements. AFSOD staffing is dependent on the operations to be conducted, but
in general, is considerably less than an AFSOC. An AFSOD can be staffed one of two ways. One option
is to use the 9AAHQ UTC and tailor it to meet specific requirements. A second option is to use the
9AAHD (AFSOD) UTC and augment it with appropriate personnel. In either event, appropriate weapons
system and communications augmentation packages can be added to the AFSOD to ensure specific mis-
sion planning capability. As a minimum, the AFSOD will consists of an operations and intelligence
branch.
An Air Force Special Operations Element (AFSOE) is an element-size Air Force special operations head-
quarters which could be a composite organization composed of different Air Force special operations
assets. It is normally subordinate to an AFSOC or an AFSOD. It may be either temporary, or permanent,
depending on the scope and duration of the operations. The AFSOE will report to its next higher head-
quarters.

          ATO Planning Cycle starts at 0600 Hours the day of execution. Times on this schedule are
          based on SOF 96 Hour planning cycle unless otherwise noted.

NOTE:
These events are based on the SOF 96 hour planning cycle. There may be times when the AFSOC
receives mission tasking which does not allow the full planning time. These missions normally require
extremely close coordination with liaisons at the theater SOC and the SOLE. The following chart shows
the AFSOC A3 planning process that normally takes place prior to executing the mission, regardless of
allowable planning time.

                STANDARD SPECIAL OPERATIONS MISSION DESIGNATION

A12.1. Purpose. This appendix provides the special operations convention for assigning discreet special
operations (SO) mission numbers. These numbers are assigned by the JFSOCC (COMSOC) and
announced in the MITASK. They are used by all SO headquarters to track missions.

A12.2. OPSEC. Planning documents listing SO missions should be classified and limited to those with a
need to know. Exceptionally sensitive missions should be compartmented and kept within discrete SPE-
CAT channels.

A12.3. Basic Format. The standard mission designation for SO has three components: mission designa-
tor, operational unit designator, and mission support designator. For example the mission "DA007/ODA
101/ADI010" may be separated as follows:
   A12.3.1. Designator. The first set of characters indicates the type of mission and assigned number.
   Numbers need not be in numerical order, but they must be discrete. In this example, DA007 desig-
   nates direct action mission number.


Mission codes include:


Unconventional Warfare                        UW
Evasion and Recovery                          ER (old terminology may include EE)

Special Operation (Other)                     SO
Coastal Patrol and Interdiction               CP


   A12.3.2. Operational Unit Designator. The middle set of characters designate the mission’s primary
   executor. In this example, this is a Special Forces Operation Detachment A-101. The Mission Plan-
   ning Agency designates this unit and adds it to the mission designation.

   A12.3.3. Mission Support Designator. The last set of characters refers to mission support action
   (infiltration, resupply, exfiltration, and so forth). The first three characters are determined during
   MICON development and are identified by the Mission Planning Agency. The supporting agency
   provides the remainder of the characters, representing the mission number (normally sequential). In
   the example, ADI 010 indicates airdrop infiltration number ten.
