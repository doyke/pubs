                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This volume provides flight examiners (FEs) and aircrews with procedures and
evaluation criteria/tolerances to be used during flight and ground phases of initial and periodic
evaluations. All E-8 evaluations will be conducted according to this volume and Air Force
Instruction (AFI) 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, as supplemented.
Specific areas for evaluation are prescribed to ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency
and capabilities of aircrews. Flight examiners will use this AFI when conducting aircrew
evaluations.
     1.1.1. Objective. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform
     required duties safely and effectively, including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems
     in accordance with applicable technical orders, instructions, and directives.
     1.1.2. Requirements. Crew position specific requirements are listed in Table 4.1, Table 5.1,
     and Table 5.2. Evaluate all crewmembers on areas listed in Table 3.1 and all instructors on
     areas listed in Table 6.1.
1.2. Applicability. This volume is applicable to all individuals performing crew duties on E-8C
and TE-8A aircraft. TE-8A does not require a separate qualification. Qualifications in E-8C are
also valid for TE-8A.
1.3. Key Words and Definitions.
     1.3.1. "Will" and "Shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.3.2. “Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.3.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.3.4. "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
     emphasize.
1.4. Recommended Changes/Waivers.
     1.4.1. Recommend changes using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
     Publication. Recommendations should focus on specific areas and standards of performance
     and sent to 116 OGV.
     1.4.2. Unless specifically noted in the appropriate section, waiver authority for this
     instruction is HQ ACC/A3, IAW AFI 11-202V2.
        1.4.2.1. Submit waiver requests through channels to HQ ACC/A3C. HQ ACC/A3CA
        will coordinate all waiver requests. All waivers from HQ ACC/A3 will include NGB/A3
        and ACC/A3TV as information addressees.
1.5. Procedures.
     1.5.1. FEs will use the criteria contained in this volume for conducting all flight, simulator,
     and emergency procedures evaluations. To ensure standard and objective evaluations, FEs
     will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.
AFI11-2E-8V2 1 APRIL 2013                                                                       5


   1.5.2. Prior to the flight, FEs will brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, and
   requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation criteria.
   1.5.3. FEs will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations, but may deny
   the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
   1.5.4. The FE will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight. During the critique,
   the FE will review the examinee’s specific deviations, area/sub area grades assigned, any
   additional training required and overall qualification level.
1.6. Grading Instructions.
   1.6.1. Evaluations are graded using the three-tier area/subarea grades (Q/Q-/U) and the
   overall qualification level grading system (Q1/Q2/Q3).
   1.6.2. Every reasonable effort should be made to evaluate all areas in flight. Verbal
   evaluations are considered alternate methods of evaluations and will be documented in the
   Additional Comments portion of the AF Form 8.
      1.6.2.1. If an alternate evaluation method is used to satisfy a part of the ground or flight
      phase requirements, enter area number, area title, reason not accomplished in the normal
      method, alternate evaluation method used and date.
   1.6.3. FEs will use the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area/subarea
   grades. FE judgment must be exercised when specific situations are not covered.
   1.6.4. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt
   corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative
   deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
1.7. Unsatisfactory Performance.
   1.7.1. FE will not allow substandard performance to jeopardize safety of flight.
   1.7.2. If at any time the FE assumes the examinee’s duties, a qualification level 3 will be
   assigned as the overall grade.
   1.7.3. A different FE will conduct rechecks.
   1.7.4. Flying (i.e. T&G, CP A/R, etc) certified individuals must demonstrate their ability to
   safely perform each maneuver and will perform it during the evaluation. If performance of
   the maneuver is not acceptable, the evaluator will recommend decertification to the SQ/CC.

                                    GROUND REQUISITES

2.1. General. Ground requirements for instrument, qualification and mission evaluations are
listed in this chapter. Flight requirements are in position specific chapters.
2.2. Ground Phase Requisites. Requisites are listed in Table 2.1 for all crew positions.
     2.2.1. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Conduct EPEs for all flight evaluations
     except for instructor-only evaluations. (EXCEPTION: Instructor Pilots will conduct an EPE
     for all evaluations to include instructor-only evals.) The EPE will include areas
     commensurate with the examinee’s qualification.
        2.2.1.1. Pilot and flight engineer EPEs will be conducted in the WST and will be
        administered by like specialty. All boldface and unusual attitude recovery procedures
        will be evaluated during the EPE, along with a sampling of emergency procedures and
        system malfunctions from all phases of flight to include preflight, engine start, taxi,
        takeoff, enroute, approach, and landing. OG/CC approval is required for pilot/flight
        engineer EPEs conducted outside of WST.
        2.2.1.2. Pilot and co-pilot EPEs and Instrument evaluations can be conducted during the
        same simulator session.
        2.2.1.3. Navigator and Mission Crew EPEs will be evaluated in-flight or verbally. The
        EPE will address emergency procedures and applicable emergency equipment and will
        include discussions on applicable notes, cautions and warnings. (NOTE: Examinees on
        initial instructor-only evaluations are not required to perform an EPE, but are responsible
        for all emergency procedures and equipment knowledge as necessary. See also Table
        6.1)

                            MISSION CREW EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. This chapter contains task areas and criteria to evaluate mission crew
qualifications during qualification and mission evaluations.
   5.1.1. This chapter applies to the following crew positions: Mission Crew Commander
   (MCC), Deputy Mission Crew Commander (DMCC), Senior Director (SD), Air Weapons
   Officer (AWO), Senior Director Technician (SDT), Air Operations Technician (AOT),
   Airborne Intelligence Officer/Technician (AIO/T), Communication Systems Technician
   (CST), Airborne Mission System Specialists (AMSS), and Airborne Target Surveillance
   Supervisor (ATSS).
5.2. Mission Crew Evaluation Requirements. In addition to the General Evaluation
Requirements, all mission crew will be evaluated on the areas listed in the Table 5.1 and Table
5.2
   5.2.1. Mission evaluations will encompass all areas identified in the evaluation requirement
   table for each crew position. An operational radar is required to complete mission crew
   evaluations. (Exception: CST/AMSS may complete evaluations if adequate system
   troubleshooting meets requirements.) Aircraft/aircrew must call on station IAW with
   applicable directives and must have sufficient station time to accomplish all required tasks.
   Evaluations should be accomplished during a live or simulated scenario involving one or
   more mission sets to include Close Air Support (CAS), Maritime (MI), Air Interdiction
   (XINT), Personnel Recovery (PR), Suppression/Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses
   (SEAD/DEAD), Tactical Air Control - Airborne (TAC(A)), or any other dynamic mission.
   5.2.2. Dual qualified MCC/SD personnel will be evaluated using both MCC and SD mission
   crew evaluation requirements listed in Table 5.1

                               INSTRUCTOR EVALUATIONS

6.1. Instructor Evaluations. Instructors are evaluated to determine their judgment, technical
knowledge, instructor ability (including error analysis of student activity), and use of grading
documents as well as proficiency in their aircrew specialty. Initial instructor evaluations may be
taken in conjunction with instrument/qualification/mission evaluations (EXCEPTION: Initial
instructor evaluations for flight engineer cannot be taken in conjunction with
qualification/mission evaluations).
   6.1.1. Instructor evaluations may be conducted with actual students or qualified
   crewmembers acting as students. The evaluator may require the evaluatee to present verbal
   explanations of equipment operations, procedures and techniques pertinent to their crew
   position duties and responsibilities.
       6.1.1.1. Instructor Pilot Evaluations. Instructor evaluations will include an air refueling
       envelope demonstration accomplished in flight and instruction of at least one VFR
       pattern or instrument approach flown by another pilot.
           6.1.1.1.1. Aircraft. Initial evaluations will be administered with an IP or evaluator
           pilot in the pilot position and the examinee in the copilot position. Recurring
           evaluations may be administered with a student, pilot, copilot, IP or evaluator
           occupying the other pilot position. For recurring IP evaluations, the examinee may
           occupy either the pilot or copilot position unless a specific position is desired by the
           FE.
       6.1.1.2. Other Aircrew Instructor Evaluations. Instructor flight evaluations will be
       conducted with a student occupying the applicable aircrew position whenever possible.
       The instructor examinee will monitor all phases of flight from an advantageous position
       and be prepared to demonstrate or explain any area or procedure. The FE will particularly
       note the instructor's ability to recognize student difficulties and provide effective, timely
       corrective action.
   6.1.2. Recurring Evaluations. Crewmembers designated as instructors will be evaluated on
   their ability to instruct during all recurring evaluations. The crewmember must occupy the
   primary seat position for a sufficient length of time to demonstrate proficiency in the crew
   position. The determination of what represents a sufficient length of time is left to the
   judgment of the evaluator.
       6.1.2.1. An instructor receiving an area grade of U in any instructor area will result in an
       overall Qual level 3 for the instructor evaluation.
       6.1.2.2. An instructor receiving a Q- in any instructor area may not instruct until the Q-
       is resolved by either additional training or debrief.
6.2. Instructor Evaluation Requirements. Will be graded using the criteria in Table 6.1
 32                                                             AFI11-2E-8V2 1 APRIL 2013
