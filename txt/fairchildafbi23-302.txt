Vehicle Driver, and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 23-302, Vehicle Management, 29 Oct 2007. It
outlines definitions, policy, and procedures for an effective vehicle accident and abuse program
with emphasis on visibility placed at the unit level, under the direct control of the unit
commander. This instruction is applicable to all persons operating government-owned or leased
vehicles (GOV) assigned to Fairchild Air Force Base or their geographically separated units.
This instruction is not applicable to Air National Guard and US Air Force Reserve units. This
instruction requires collecting and maintaining information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974

Terms
Owning Organization—The organization that is authorized and assigned the GOV.
Using Organization—The organization that was using the GOV at the time of the
accident/abuse/incident.
Vehicle Abuse—An act of neglect or oversight that caused or may cause damage to a GOV and

operator maintenance or turn in vehicle in a timely manner for scheduled or unscheduled
maintenance will justify abuse actions.

outcome, but no intent or neglect was indicated.
Vehicle Accident Report—A written report completed by law enforcement detailing a vehicle
accident and typically assessing responsibility for the accident or the operator’s inscribed
Standard Form (SF) 91. AFJMAN 24-306 and state law require that law enforcement be
summoned to a vehicle accident.
Vehicle Fair Wear and Tear—The normally expected deterioration of a vehicle or equipment
based on its age, usage, and life expectancy.
Vehicle Incident—Any situation where a GOV sustains damage where the actions of any
participative vehicle operator could not have foreseen or prevented the outcome (i.e., act of
nature).
