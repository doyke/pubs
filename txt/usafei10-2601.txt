                                               Chapter 1

                                     GENERAL DESCRIPTION

1.1. Background.
    1.1.1. The CWC was ratified 29 October 1996 and its entry into force (EIF) was 29 April 1997. The
    United States Government ratified the treaty 24 April 1997. As a result, all United States Air Force
    (USAF) bases are subject to on-site challenge inspections. At some time during the life of the CWC
    Treaty, a USAFE base may be selected for a challenge inspection. Therefore, all USAFE bases must
    be prepared to meet, process, house, monitor, transport, and support the multi-national inspection
    team (IT), the Host Team (HT), the Army Mobile Treaty Laboratory (AMTL), and the National
    Escort team (NET).
    1.1.2. The probability of a USAF asset being inspected is low; however, the implications of such an
    inspection are of enormous consequence to the United States Government (USG) and all commands
    must be prepared to successfully host and conduct a challenge inspection. Therefore, to minimize
    time, resources, and personnel impact on facilities, the Air Force through its National Security
    Policy Division (AF/A5XP), developed the Headquarter (HQ) USAF Inspection Support Manual
    (ISM) and the Base Assistance Team (BAT) concept. The ISM is designed to guide the base
    through a CWC challenge inspection (CI) as an ―off-the-shelf‖ product, negating the need for lower-
    level plan development and rehearsal / exercises. In order to deal with the unique aspects of
    operations in theater and to assist units in implementing the ISM, HQ USAFE provides additional
    guidance through this instruction.
1.2. Definitions. Detailed explanations of terms pertaining to a CWC CI can be found within the CWC
itself. Brief descriptions of key terms will be presented here to aid in using this USAFE Instruction.
    1.2.1. Base Assistance Team (BAT): The USAF BAT consists of personnel from the Defense
    Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), Air Staff, Defense Treaty Inspection Readiness Program
    (DTIRP), and major command (MAJCOM) Treaty Compliance Officers (TCO). The BAT is a team
    of technical experts who will assist the inspected USAF facility to prepare for the inspection. The
    USAFE BAT is comprised of the Threat Reduction Branch (HQ USAFE/A8PT) staff and it’s
    regional TCOs who will arrive first at USAFE CI sites and begin inspection preparations per the
    ISM. The USAF and USAFE BATs will merge their resources in providing technical advice to the
    inspected site.
    1.2.2. Challenge Inspection (CI): A fact-finding event used to investigate an allegation of non-
    compliance with the CWC made by one State Party (SP) against another. It may occur at any site
    where suspected non-compliant activities are taking place to include any United States (U.S.)
    military base or private, commercial facility throughout Europe.
    1.2.3. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC): A multi-national arms control treaty that prohibits
    the development, production, stockpiling, transfer, use, and preparation for use of chemical weapons.
    1.2.4. Host Country Agreement (HCA): Document which describes the obligations and
    procedures between the Host Country and the U.S. regarding all facets of supporting a CWC CI.
    Use HCAs to coordinate logistical support for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
    Weapons (OPCW) IT from the Point of Entry (POE) to the site as well as Host Country (HC)
    involvement in the CI. If the HCA has not been formally approved by the U.S. and HC, use the
    latest proposed HCA as the basis for HC support, subject to negotiation.
USAFEI10-2601 15 NOVEMBER 2008                                                                       3


   1.2.5. Host Team (HT): The HT represents the U.S. government and Department of Defense
   (DoD) in direct dealings with the Inspection Team. The HT provides policy, insures that the U.S.
   demonstrates compliance, and protects base interests.
   1.2.6. Inspection Control Group (ICG): An organization designated by the base/wing commander
   to control and coordinate base support of the CI. This group is similar to the Crisis Action Team
   (CAT) used by many bases. It consists of representatives from various base organizations who will
   support the inspection. Bases should designate their applicable key functional support organizations
   and personnel as an ICG in order to agree with USAF terminology in the ISM.
   1.2.7. Inspection Support Manual (ISM): Provides the information and tools (checklists,
   operational instructions, etc.) needed by the respective USAFE Treaty Compliance Officer (TCO)
   and Inspection Control Group (ICG) Chief to deal successfully with a CI.
   1.2.8. Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW): The implementing
   body of the CWC comprised of SP representatives and experts in the chemicals and procedures
   pertinent to the CWC. The OPCW is located in The Hague, Netherlands, and conducts CWC
   inspections as prescribed by the treaty.
   1.2.9. Treaty Compliance Officer (TCO): Each USAFE site is supported by a regional TCO who
   is responsible for advising the installation/base commander of various arms control treaty
   inspections that could occur at the site and for preparing the site to receive such inspections.
1.3. References. The following publications contain basic authorities and guidance for the conduct of
CWC CIs:
   1.3.1. Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, and use of
   Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, January 1993 (CWC).

                                               Chapter 2

                          GENERAL GUIDANCE AND INFORMATION

2.1. Purpose. The HQ USAFE Chemical Weapons Convention Challenge Inspection (USAFEI 10-
2601) replaces the HQ USAFE CWC Implementation and Compliance Plan (I&C Plan) dated 8 May
1998 and provides additional guidance to USAFE bases supplementing the USAF I&C Plan and ISM.
Chapter 3 of this instruction identifies USAFE-unique requirements to comply with CWC challenge
inspections.
    2.1.1. The long title of this document is the HQ USAFE Chemical Weapons Convention Challenge
    Inspection (CWC CI). The short title is the USAFE CWC CI Instruction.
    2.1.2. This document is unclassified. Organizations may reproduce all or portions of this Instruction
    as needed. Units should send proposed changes to Threat Reduction Branch (HQ USAFE/A8PT).
2.2. Command Relationships. Within the USAFE Area of Responsibility (AOR), treaty compliance
expertise is resident at the MAJCOM and regional TCO level. Commander, USAFE (COMUSAFE) will
therefore use ―Skip Echelon‖ tasking for arms control matters. Numbered Air Forces (NAF) will be
INFO addressees unless a tasking specifically requires their input. HQ USAFE/A8PT will assign
regional TCOs to assist all USAF units in the EUCOM theater.
2.3. Responsibilities.
    2.3.1. Air Staff. (HQ USAF/A5XP) (For Information Only). Provide overall guidance to USAF
    units for conducting CWC CIs by publishing the USAF I&C Plan and the ISM. Organize and train
    the USAF BAT. Conduct CWC tabletop and inspection exercises for MAJCOM personnel and
    bases as requested. Establish and operate the Air Force Response Cell during actual CWC CIs.
    2.3.2. Headquarters United States European Command (EUCOM/ECJ5-W, Weapons of Mass
    Destruction Division). (For Information Only) Provide operational guidance, as required, as the
    Combatant Command under which USAFE operates as its air component. Function as the head of
    the Host Team if tasked to do so. Although EUCOM has a limited role in a CWC CI, USAFE units
    must insure that operational concerns arising during a CI which could impact a unit’s mission are
    coordinated through both USAFE and EUCOM for resolution. EUCOM/ECJ5-W at DSN 430-5438
    is the EUCOM office of primary responsibility (OPR) for arms control matters.
    2.3.3. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). (For Information Only) Function as the US
    Government (USG) representative assisting with POE procedures, OPCW equipment inspection, and
    escort duties. The DTRA On-Site Europe Division (DTRA-OSE) will assist as required.
    2.3.4. Host Nation Verification Agencies. Will execute duties as outlined in respective HCAs.
    2.3.5. Headquarters United States Air Forces in Europe (HQ USAFE). The HQ USAFE Threat
    Reduction Branch (HQ USAFE/A8PT) is the USAFE OPR for this Instruction. Additionally, HQ
    USAFE/A8PT will:
       2.3.5.1. Provide guidance and training for all USAFE bases.
       2.3.5.2. Provide a member to the USAF CWC Working Group under HQ USAFE/A5XP.
       2.3.5.3. Serve on the USAF BAT and as Deputy BAT Chief at USAFE CIs.
       2.3.5.4. Appoint Regional TCOs to support treaty requirements for each USAFE base.
USAFEI10-2601 15 NOVEMBER 2008                                                                       5


   2.3.6. Wing/Base Commanders. The site commander will serve as a Host Team member or will
   designate someone to act on his or her behalf. He/she will select a capable person to serve as the
   ICG Chief. The commander should provide guidance to the regional TCO to insure the inspection is
   managed properly.
      2.3.6.1. Each base should be prepared to support a CI by providing adequate workspace,
      billeting, and transportation needs for the various participants in the CI. The regional TCO
      supporting a particular base should insure the requirements outlined in the ISM can be met.
      2.3.6.2. Each base will integrate the USAFE and USAF BATs into their inspection operations as
      needed.
   2.3.7. Treaty Compliance Officers (TCO). Regional TCOs will be responsible for providing
   guidance and training (as required) for all USAF bases and geographically separated units (GSU)
   within their assigned regions. If a CI occurs in their region, TCOs will be responsible for insuring
   all the actions outlined in Chapter 3 are accomplished successfully.
2.4. European Points of Entry Info. See Attachment 2 for CWC POE locations in Europe.

                                               Chapter 3

                                USAFE-UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Preparation of USAFE Sites for a CWC CI. TCOs responsible for USAFE bases and GSUs in a
given region should insure that reasonable advance preparations are taken for potential CWC CIs. As a
minimum, TCOs should accomplish the actions below.
3.1.1 Awareness. Through briefings to senior staff, attendance at commanders’ calls, base newspaper
articles, and other means, TCOs will educate the base populace and leadership that the CWC is one of
the arms control treaties that the command must be prepared to execute. Stress the unlikelihood of an
actual inspection, tell them about the BAT, and briefly explain your plans to use ―off-the-shelf‖
checklists and guidance to prepare for a CI versus having regular base exercises.
    3.1.2. On-Hand References. Insure that each unit has a copy of the following references:
       3.1.2.1. Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, and use of
       Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, January 1993 (CWC).
       3.1.2.2. U.S. Air Force Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation and Compliance Plan,
       28 February 1997 (USAF CWC I&C Plan).
       3.1.2.3. U.S. Air Force Chemical Weapons Convention Inspection Support Manual (ISM), April
       2003 (or most current draft version).
       3.1.2.4. HQ USAFE Chemical Weapons Convention Challenge Inspection (CWC CI) (USAFEI
       10-2601) - this Instruction.
       3.1.2.5. Relevant HCAs with countries where USAF assets monitored by Regional TCOs are
       located.
    3.1.3. Personalize ISM Briefings and Memos. The ISM contains ready-to-use checklists, briefings,
    and memos designed to meet CWC treaty requirements. TCOs should familiarize themselves with
    all the templates in the ISM and be prepared to ―personalize‖ the required information in the event of
    a CWC CI:
       3.1.3.1. Situation Briefing (Attachment 4 to TCO’s Section).
       3.1.3.2. Facility Manager’s Training, Local Escort Training, Security Preparation, Lodging and
       Workspace, and Self-Monitoring Memos (Attachment 3 to TCO’s Section).
       3.1.3.3. Pre-Inspection Briefing to the Inspection Team (Attachment 7 to TCO’s Section).
       3.1.3.4. Off-Site Telephone Procedures Memo (Attachment 3 to Support Team Section).
    3.1.4. Identify Base Command and Control Structure for a CWC CI. In the event of a CWC CI
    at a USAFE installation, the wing/base commander should be prepared to identify who (by duty
    position) should be the Host Team representative and ICG Chief. Normally, the commander or
    deputy will be on the HT. The Chief of Plans or Base Inspector General is a logical choice as ICG
    Chief but the commander can choose whomever he/she wants. Other considerations:
       3.1.4.1. Use guidance from the ISM to select who (by position) should head the Administrative,
       Perimeter, Self-Monitoring, Mandate, Base Preparation, Local Escort, Transportation, Support,
       and Communications Teams.
USAFEI10-2601 15 NOVEMBER 2008                                                                       7


       3.1.4.2. Make sure ISM sections for each team containing their respective checklists, memos,
       and briefings are available and can be distributed quickly once a CI is declared.
   3.1.5. Logistical Requirements. A CWC CI should result in approximately 150 people coming to
   the area of the base from the OPCW Inspection Team (IT), the National Escort Team (ET), USAFE
   and Air Force BATs, Army Treaty Lab, and other support agencies. In the event of a CWC CI,
   USAFE bases should be prepared to support all the requirements both on and off base for billeting,
   workspace, communications, transportation, security, and other such requirements as specified in the
   ISM. Other considerations:
       3.1.5.1. Office machines and administrative areas will need to be established both on and off
       base. Identify a means to fax information to the POE(s) in your country.
       3.1.5.2. Suggest a meeting facility for the ICG that would be available for ten days without
       interruption.
       3.1.5.3. Determine the number and location of Land Mobile Radios (LMR) that could support a
       CWC CI.
       3.1.5.4. Develop provisional plans to provide adequate local transportation, on-base meals,
       local/base maps, and other such requirements to support a CWC CI.
   3.1.6. Host Country Coordination. Obtain an approved or working copy of the HCA for the
   country where the base or site is located. Establish contact with the appropriate wing/base Host
   Nation Advisor (HNA) and explain the assistance you would need should a CWC CI be declared.
   Using the HCA and the HNA, determine the privately-owned facilities, if any, that reside within 50
   meters outside the base perimeter and coordinate with local authorities as to how you would access
   those facilities during a CWC CI.
3.2. USAFE and USAF BATs. The USAFE BAT will arrive quickly to assist the responsible TCO and
local commander in handling a CWC CI. The USAF BAT will begin arriving roughly 12 hours after
notification of the CI. Simply, the BATs will be dispersed among the various functional teams while
representatives from HQ USAFE/A8PT and Air Staff advise the HT and ICG Chief. The main
operating bases will generally have two regional TCOs immediately dispatched to the designated
location. Suggested BAT roles:
   3.2.1. The respective regional TCO will conduct initial briefings, work with the ICG and base
   support personnel, and perform other duties per the ISM.
   3.2.2. The backup TCO can assist the Self-Monitoring Team since they must begin monitoring
   quickly.
   3.2.3. The MAJCOM TCO will advise the respective base commander or representative on the Host
   Team.
   3.2.4. The USAF BAT can support or relieve the USAFE BAT as needed.
8                                                         USAFEI10-2601 15 NOVEMBER 2008


3.3. USAFE Changes to the ISM. The ISM is designed for ready use at any USAF installation facing
a CWC CI. Accordingly, USAFE bases should use the ISM to help them manage a CI at their
installation. Any procedural changes from the ISM should be coordinated with the Threat Reduction
Branch, (HQ USAFE/A8PT).
