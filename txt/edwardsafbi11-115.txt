     requirement for systems used on National Ranges.
2. Scheduling Guidelines:
     2.1. All agencies assigned to EAFB utilizing 412 TW flight test resources, airspace and
     airfield facilities will utilize the following procedures for scheduling. When more than one
     resource will satisfy the requirements, indicate all alternative options in the Resourced Notes
     of the request. Backups will be so designated in mission and sortie titles in CSE by
     annotating a (P) for the primary mission and a (B) for the back-up mission. Missions
     requiring multiple consecutive back-up days require 412 OG/CC approval. 412 OSS/OSOS
     Current Operations will consider only those projects having 412 TW approval and which are
     supplemented by sufficiently detailed plans for proper scheduling. Project documentation
     must be in the hands of all support and control agencies in advance of scheduling the
     mission. Incomplete requested missions may not be considered if lacking sufficient details to
     de-conflict high demand resources.
     2.2. Telemetry Support and/or Requests. When telemetry resources are required to support a
     flight or ground activity, schedulers will request and coordinate these assets in CSE.
     412 OSS/OSOS Current Ops will de-conflict telemetry between EAFB units and ultimately
     with all regional users through the Integrated Frequency Deconfliction System (IFDS).
     2.3. Precision Impact Range Area (PIRA). Project managers will provide all release profiles,
     parameters, and ballistics data for missions involving weapons or parachute testing in the
     PIRA to the 412 TW/SETR RSO or designated representative no later than (NLT) 2 weeks
     before the planned mission. 412 TW/SETR RSO will coordinate mission, weapons, or
     parachute parameters with 412 RANS RCOs and Chief, PIRA Operations in sufficient time
     to support planned mission.
EDWARDSAFBI11-115 4 APRIL 2014                                                               7


  2.4. Over-Flight Restrictions of Detachment 7, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and
  the PIRA. If missions or activities require over-flight restrictions of the AFRL or the PIRA
  schedulers will annotate details of this requirement in CSE on initial input and coordinate
  with 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations. 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations will re-
  coordinate scheduled AFRL missions prior to execution, whereas 412 OSS/OSOS Real-Time
  Operations will coordinate all real-time changes or cancellations during execution.
  2.5. Closure of On-Base Roadways. If a mission poses potential hazard to roadways (i.e.
  Mercury Blvd), the unit scheduler will identify this at the Wed 1200L weekly scheduling
  meeting, NLT the week prior to execution. The unit scheduler will coordinate road closure
  requirements with 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations to facilitate test mission completion.
  Missions requiring road closure Monday-Sunday between 0600-0800L and/or 1530-1700L
  require approval of the 412 OG/CC, which may be granted at the Wed 1200L weekly
  scheduling meeting, NLT the week prior to execution. During these time frames, missions
  will only be approved for exceptional circumstances and require coordination between 412
  OG/CC and AFRL. 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations will notify appropriate agencies, to
  include AFRL, of road closures NLT 1400L the day prior to the closure. 412 OSS/OSOS
  Real-Time Operations will coordinate day of road closure slips and cancellations.
  2.6. Airfield Operations During Non-Duty Hours. Current airfield hours are published in the
  DoD Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Supplement.
  Airspace normal operating hours are listed in EAFBI 13-100, Flying and Airfield Operations.
  Deviations from these will be published in a NOTAM.
     2.6.1. Requests for airfield operations support during scheduled closure periods must be
     coordinated by 1100L three business days prior (72 hours minimum) to the planned event
     by completing an AHSR in CSE. Back up days shall be requested at the same time to
     ensure adequate notification. Back up days will be clearly marked as such.
     2.6.2. Any changes or cancellations to approved after-hours operations must be
     coordinated through the 412 OG/CC as soon as possible but NLT 24 hours prior to the
     event, if possible. 412 OSS/OSA will publish NOTAMs to alert airfield users of the
     change in hours.
  2.7. Unit schedulers will not schedule aircraft returning from off station on Sundays or
  holidays for flight the following day. Exceptions require approval of the 412 MXG/CC and
  412 OG/CC.
  2.8. Range Support Release (RSR). Test agencies or their representatives shall release all
  scheduled resources or portions of scheduled resources any time they are deemed no longer
  needed based on changes to test objectives, missions, or schedules. Test agencies shall
  provide RSR information to 412 OSS Real-Time on the day of the mission. 412 OSS Real-
  Time will relay this information to the Range ODO.
  2.9. Hazardous Tests. Test missions which have been designated as hazardous, either
  medium or high risk, must be identified in CSE. Unit schedulers will annotate hazardous tests
  in the mission title using the designation “HAZ TST XX-XXX,” where the Xs indicate the
  safety package number.
  2.10. Air Show Practice Procedures.
8                                                      EDWARDSAFBI11-115 4 APRIL 2014


       2.10.1. Unit Responsibilities. Individual units will request air show practices through
       412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations via CSE or an EDWARDSAFB Form 5016.
       Schedulers will designate air show practices over the airfield in CSE as "air show
       practice” in the mission title with airfield closure time in the scheduling notes under the
       aircraft. For air show practices flown in the Military Operating Areas (MOA), schedulers
       will include “air show practice” in scheduling notes under aircraft and not in the mission
       title. Pilots may fly air show practices in conjunction with test or test support missions
       and schedulers will annotate “air show practice” appropriately in CSE.
           2.10.1.1. Schedulers shall normally schedule air show practice over the field after
           1600L to minimize the effect on USAF Test Pilot School launches and recoveries.
           Schedulers shall keep in mind, 412 TW Scheduling will schedule a minimum of 15
           minutes between airfield closures to launch and recover other aircraft.
           2.10.1.2. To ensure all flying units are aware of approved air show practices, the Air
           Show Chairman or designated representative will coordinate with the 412 OG/CC for
           an approved closure to conduct air show practice IAW the airspace waiver request.
           The Air Show Chairman will notify 412 OSS/OSA for NOTAM action to publicize
           the closure to the flying community.
           2.10.1.3. Air Show practice will be conducted IAW the approved airspace waiver
           request. An airspace NOTAM will be issued to identify specific airspace restrictions
           during the identified practice times.
       2.10.2. Delays and/or changes. 412 OSS/OSOS will be responsible for de-confliction of
       air show practices. If a flight is delayed and cannot be completed within the designated
       time block, it will either be re-scheduled or canceled. Air Show Chairman must obtain
       412 OG/CC approval to re-schedule or add-on. After the change is approved, the Air
       Show Chairman will confirm the change with 412 OSS/OSOS Real-Time Operations,
       who will amend the CSE schedule and alert Airfield Management Operations.
       2.10.3. Aircrew Responsibilities. Aircrews will ensure the Air Show Chairman and Air
       Boss are aware of the specific airspace requests to encompass requirements for the
       practices within the airspace waiver. Air Show practice briefings shall be coordinated by
       the Air Show Air Boss. Agencies such as Airfield Operations Facilities (Airfield
       Management Operations and Tower), Fire Department, Security Forces, Weather, etc.
       concerned with the scheduled events will be in attendance. The aircraft commander or
       flight leader will brief the agencies on specifics (altitude, discrete radio frequency for
       tower, safety observer and air show profile). The aircraft commander or flight leader will
       notify the Air Boss of any delays as soon as possible.
    2.11. Requests for OffBase Range Support. In order to ensure all supporting agencies are
    informed of changes, 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations will confirm off-base support
    requirements. Units utilizing off-base range support (China Lake, Point Mugu, Vandenberg,
    Nevada Test & Training Range, etc.) must provide specific range/resource information in
    CSE, along with mission data. 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations will confirm support
    during day prior coordination.
    2.12. Airspace Scheduling. Aircrew, project engineers or directors, and unit schedulers shall
    request only the resources required for mission accomplishment. This includes the MOAs,
EDWARDSAFBI11-115 4 APRIL 2014                                                                 9


  Restricted Areas, Ranges, and R-2515’s ASU. Both unit schedulers and 412 OSS/OSOS
  must be proactive in providing guidance and be responsible to enforce resource scheduling
  procedures.
     2.12.1. The following procedures are to be used for cross country, out and back, or
     flights conducted partially outside of R-2508 (round robins) requiring use of DD Form
     175, Military Flight Plan. This process will clarify airspace scheduling procedures upon
     departure or return to base (RTB).
         2.12.1.1. Aircraft from EAFB or Air Force Plant 42 departing or arriving on a
         DD Form 175 and not requiring SUA or ASU will list only DD Form 175 in CSE as
         the sole resource. No other airspace needs to be scheduled.
         2.12.1.2. If SUA or ASU is required on departure or RTB, list airspace requirements
         with associated altitude and time in CSE. Do not list DD Form 175.
         2.12.1.3. When predicting use of “Palmdale Pattern” only, select the Palmdale
         Pattern option and file a DD Form 175.
     2.12.2. Airspace Changes. The FAA requires 2 hours advance notice to activate MOAs
     and 15 minutes to activate restricted areas when the airspace has been released for joint
     use. Coordinate request through CCF. Outside normal duty hours, project managers and
     aircrews shall contact the CCF for revisions to airspace requirements, cancellations or
     slips.
  2.13. Link 16. Requests for Link 16 testing will include date and time of test, all aircraft or
  ground stations involved (both on/off range and CTF assets), total Time Slot Duty Factor
  (TSDF) for all participants, Network Design Load (NDL), and the crypto key short title. This
  includes the ground vans operated by the 412 RANS. These will then be placed into the
  geographical Link 16 scheduling web site by 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations. These
  requests will be de-conflicted utilizing the standard 412 TW priority system and scheduling
  timelines (para 5). Any conflict with other military and commercial agencies within 100
  nautical miles of mission work area will be worked by 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations
  the day prior to mission day. De-confliction measures include the utilization of different
  crypto keys, different network loads, adjusting TSDF, or shifting of mission times.
  2.14. Quiet Hours. Quiet Hours are requested for ceremonies/events or to comply with noise
  abatement rules during specified time periods as directed by the 412 OG/CC. The quiet hours
  request process shall be completed as follows:
     2.14.1. Requesting agency shall make a formal request for quiet hours NLT 2 weeks
     prior to the ceremony/event through 412 TW Scheduling.
     2.14.2. Specific details required to process the approval are: purpose for the request (e.g.
     Change of Command, Retirement Ceremony, etc.), Date, Time, and Location (relative to
     the airfield) of Event.
     2.14.3. Requesting agency shall accomplish required coordination with 412 TW
     Scheduling by completing an Electronic Staff Summary Sheet processed via email
     (Attachment 6).
10                                                    EDWARDSAFBI11-115 4 APRIL 2014


     2.14.4. The 412 OG/CC is the final approval authority. Once approved, 412 TW
     Scheduling will notify 412 OSS/OSA which shall post the appropriate NOTAM no
     earlier than 5 calendar days prior to the event.
  2.15. To reduce the demand on available tunable UHF radios at the range communications
  switch, the identified non-tunable UHF frequencies assigned to each unit will be scheduled
  first, with any remaining unit-assigned frequencies used only as needed. A current list of
  non-tunable and tunable UHF frequencies will be available at 412 OSS/OSOS.
  2.16. Priority.
     2.16.1. General. CTF’s will submit their unit daily test program, project, and proficiency
     prioritization on a separate spreadsheet in conjunction with CSE timeline requirements,
     two Fridays prior to the flying week. Summarize program timeline status with
     explanatory details. 412 TW Scheduling will determine priorities based upon program
     status provided by 412 TMG and will meld all inputs into a 412 TW priority by the
     following Monday 1200L. 412 TW Scheduling will adjust support requirements to ensure
     maximum utilization of resources. Missions moved by 412 OSS/OSOS Current
     Operations based on resource availability, SUA, or ASU saturation will maintain their
     priority. Scheduling conflicts which cannot be resolved by 412 OSS/OSOS Current
     Operations will be referred to the 412 OG/CC or placed in stand-by.
     2.16.2. Ground Test Priority. Test and test support flights will have priority over ground
     tests. Non-test flights may have priority over ground tests with 412 OG/CC (or
     designated representative) approval.
  2.17. Mission Numbers. A four-digit number identifies missions on the schedule. Multiple
  sorties within a given mission package will be further identified by a numeric suffix
  beginning with -1 for the primary aircraft and followed by -2, -3, etc., for subsequent aircraft
  in the mission. With the exception of spare aircraft, once a mission number is published or
  added to the approved daily schedule, the mission is accountable as either flown, cancelled,
  or completed. For units planning missions that will utilize the same airframe with multiple
  departure (i.e., “turn”) times in a given day, unit schedulers will schedule airspace and
  altitudes to reflect predicted multiple mission requirements.
  2.18. Schedule Changes/Adds/Cancels. All changes, adds, or cancellations shall be reported
  promptly to 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations and/or Real-Time Operations to allow
  maximum opportunity to coordinate and reschedule resources. Normal requests for add-ons
  and changes will be accepted by 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations before 1100L on the
  workday prior to the mission and will be considered first-come, first-served and scheduled on
  a strictly non-interference basis with the previously scheduled missions. Exceptions for
  priority add-ons require 412 OG/CC and 412 MXG/CC approval, and will be coordinated
  through 412 TW Scheduling. However, resources requiring long lead-time may be added on
  as soon as requirements are identified and coordinated through 412 OSS/OSOS Current
  Operations, 412 TW Scheduling, and 412 OG/CC.
  2.19. Not Available (NA) Aircraft. Aircraft operations resources not available for the flying
  schedule will be coded as NA01 in CSE and run consecutively (i.e. NA01, NA02, NA03)
  based upon priority for fill for each mission design series (MDS). Aircraft in NA status
EDWARDSAFBI11-115 4 APRIL 2014                                                                  11


  against the weekly schedule that become available for the daily schedule prior to 1200L on
  the day prior will be considered an add-on and retain mission priority.
  2.20. Standby (SB) Resources. Resource requests other than aircraft which exceed resource
  availability will be placed in SB status. Missions will be hard scheduled. Resources will be
  filled as they become available.
  2.21. Reimbursement Policy for Schedule Cancellations. Funding provisions for
  cancellations are contained in DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation and
  applicable AFTC regulations. In general, they provide for charging to the project those costs
  associated with test and test support mission cancellations.
     2.21.1. 412 OSS Real-Time will use the Cost Recovery Decision Chart (CRDC)
     (Attachment 2) to establish who will pay for the mission cancellation, including off-range
     cancellations. Sympathetic cancellations will be given the same CRDC code as the
     mission causing the cancellation. Users may be liable for costs incurred for test or test
     support mission cancellations and aborts after 1200L the workday prior to the scheduled
     mission.
     2.21.2. On the workday following each test or test support mission cancellation (mission
     symbols O-4, O-5 and O-6 reimbursable), 412 OSS Real-Time will determine the
     primary reason for cancellation and assign a cancellation code from the CRDC. 412 OSS
     Real-Time will coordinate with Range ODO to determine which primary range assets
     were affected by each cancellation. A test mission cancellation report will be generated
     daily to record each determination and to charge for cancellation costs that have been
     incurred by the test project. Any disputed reasons for cancellation that cannot be resolved
     by 412 MOS/MOO or 412 OSS Real-Time will be referred to 412 OG/CC.
     2.21.3. Off-Range Cancellation Policy.
         2.21.3.1. If the off-range mission should cancel as a result of a decision made by the
         test requester or the non-availability of a resource provided by the test requester, the
         test program is charged for the cancellation costs.
         2.21.3.2. If an off-range mission should cancel as a result of the non-availability of a
         scheduled or required 412 TW resource, the 412 TW would absorb the off-range
         cancellation costs.
         2.21.3.3. Priority Bumping. Users may be liable for off-range cancellation charges
         incurred to another program as a result of priority bumping. If a program with a
         higher priority schedules a mission causing another program to cancel an off-range
         mission due to lost resources, the off-range cancellation costs will be assumed by the
         priority program. When an off-range mission is put in jeopardy,
         412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations will notify the priority user operations officer of
         the liability for a final decision on bumping. The requesting unit operations officer
         will respond to 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations by 1500L to enable maximum
         coordination.
     2.21.4. Financial liability will not usually exceed the direct costs incurred except for
     special purpose facilities scheduled in advance for a specific period. In this case, liability
     may also include lost reimbursements, unless the test and evaluation activity is able to
12                                                   EDWARDSAFBI11-115 4 APRIL 2014


     schedule a substitute workload. Specific cancellation charges are listed in the 412 TW
     Product Identification Number (PIN) Rate Catalog.
  2.22. Off-Base Aircraft. All off-base aircraft requesting the use of R-2515 shall be reported
  in CSE by 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations and/or Real-Time Operations, or the R-2515
  Airspace Manager to ensure an accurate count of aircraft utilizing R-2515 airspace.
  2.23. Airstart Scheduling. During the summer months (1 June - 30 September), airstart
  missions shall be scheduled to land NLT 1100L. This is to protect the responding
  maintenance crews from thermal injury and remain in compliance with applicable
  Environmental Safety and Occupation Health Compliance Assessment and Management
  Program (ESOHCAMP) standards. All airstart requirements shall be addressed during the
  weekly scheduling meeting (held 1200L, every Wed prior to execution), with notifications
  being made during the Quarterly Scheduling Meeting.
  2.24. Airlift Loads. Details for airlift loads shall be entered into the CSE aircraft notes to
  include type and quantity, weight of each load, a station number and side of aircraft (left or
  right) and time for upload or download.
  2.25. Local Fly Window & After Hours Support Request (AHSR) Process. The local fly
  window is coordinated between the 412 OG/CC and 412 MXG/CC at the weekly scheduling
  meeting. Planned operations outside of the coordinated local fly window require submission
  of an AHSR to 412 TW Scheduling for coordination.
     2.25.1. Requests for SPORT outside normal hours (reference EDWARDSAFBI 13-100)
     must be coordinated by 1100L three business days (72 hours minimum) prior to the
     planned event by completing an AHSR through Center Scheduling Enterprise (CSE).
     Should the AHSR be for more than one day, SPORT may have to adjust personnel shift
     schedules; in this case, the AHSR must be submitted not less than 2 weeks prior in order
     to ensure support.
     2.25.2. Any unique AHSR for weekend, second- or third-shift refueling must be pre-
     coordinated by 1100L three business days prior (72 hours minimum) to ensure support.
  2.26. Ground Test Operations (GTO). A GTO is defined as a scheduled test of an aircraft or
  its systems that is performed on the ground. The event must be in support of an approved test
  program. The pre-test and post-test actions are included in the GTO. When 412 TW aircraft
  are utilized for non-flying missions, they will be scheduled through the normal weekly or
  daily process and assigned a mission number by CSE. GTOs associated with a flying mission
  may be conducted under the flight mission number.
  2.27. Temporary-2 (T-2) Modification Schedules. Particular attention will be paid to early
  notification of potential modifications and preliminary package briefing to the Configuration
  Control Board. Project officers will coordinate with Plans, Scheduling, & Documentation
  (PS&D) and the T-2 Mod Division (412 MXG/MXI) to ensure that schedules are adjusted to
  meet test program requirements with minimum delay. Project officers will keep PS&D
  advised when project or instrumentation work other than T-2 mod is forecasted or being
  accomplished by project personnel.
  2.28. Functional Check Flights (FCFs) and Operational Check Flights (OCFs). After
  coordination between the affected Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) and Maintenance
EDWARDSAFBI11-115 4 APRIL 2014                                                            13


   Quality Assurance (412 MXG/MXQ), the flying unit will coordinate with 412 TW
   Scheduling to schedule FCFs and OCFs. FCFs and OCFs will be incorporated into the real-
   time schedule and, when flown, will be considered flown as scheduled.
   412 OSS/OSOS Real-Time Operations will load data into CSE. The Maintenance Operations
   Center (MOC) will update the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) after the aircraft
   launches. Additional considerations for flying FCFs refer to AFI 21-101 Aircraft and
   Equipment Maintenance Management, para. 8.16.5.1.1 and T.O. 1-1-300.
   2.29. Crew Ready and Aircraft Turn Times. Normal crew ready is 1 hour prior to scheduled
   departure time for all USAF-owned aircraft. Normal turn times are as follows:

Table 1. Normal Turn Times by Airframe
Airframe                       Normal Turn Time (hrs)
F-16 (Shadow – 445 FLTS) 2.0
F-16 (Falcon – 416 FLTS)       3.0
T-38                           1.5
C-12                           1.5
F-35                           3.0
F-22                           3.0
Bombers & Tankers1             4.0
Heavy & Cargo                  2.0
Note: 13.0 hr turn time for 412 FLTS tanker
   2.30. Aircraft interchanges (tail swaps) should be used to prevent reconfigurations and
   unnecessary work expenditures when the primary aircraft is not mission capable by its
   scheduled takeoff time. Every effort will be made to make interchanges at the 1300L daily
   maintenance production meeting the day prior to the scheduled day.
3. Scheduling Procedures:
   3.1. Schedule Timelines are detailed below and follow a progression from long-term
   planning (strategic) through forecast schedule operations (operational) to daily schedule
   operations (tactical). These are summarized in Attachment 3 and Attachment 4.
   3.2. Long-Term Planning (Strategic). The ability of maintenance to meet operational
   requirements is accomplished through negotiated schedules. Long-term planning specifies
   broad objectives for flights in terms of sorties and flying hours and known or predictable
   maintenance needs. Long-term planning will be developed utilizing 412 TW Yearly Flying
   Program information.
      3.2.1. The annual flying forecast from business managers is available in the Workload
      Forecast after the flying hour program is presented by 412 OG/CC. Unit business
      managers will validate Flying Actuals Approval and Billing (FAAB) by the 10th of each
      month. This will be used as a starting point for all schedule activities.
      3.2.2. Quarterly Look. Approximately 6 weeks prior to each new quarter (third
      Wednesday of Nov/Feb/May/Aug), in conjunction with the weekly scheduling meeting, a
      look ahead will be conducted for the next quarter’s plan of sorties.
14                                                   EDWARDSAFBI11-115 4 APRIL 2014


     3.2.3. Monthly Look. Each Wednesday, in conjunction with the weekly scheduling
     meeting, the next four weeks’ resource projections will be coordinated with the AMUs
     and AMXS supervision. 412 OSS/OSOS will submit the monthly schedule to the 412
     OG/CC and 412 MXG/CC for approval and published not later than the last day of the
     previous month.
  3.3. Forecast Schedule Operations (Operational).
     3.3.1. Initial Input. Users at the squadrons or agencies needing 412 TW resources
     accomplish the initial input to the flying schedule.
         3.3.1.1. Users with access to CSE. Requesting agencies will submit their weekly
         requirements via the scheduling software tool, currently CSE, by 1500L Friday, 2
         weeks prior to the forecast week. Adjustments to this timeline will be posted on the
         CSE Homepage.
         3.3.1.2. Users without access to CSE. Requesting and/or off-base agencies who do
         not have access to CSE will submit weekly requirements by 1200L Friday, 2 weeks
         prior to the forecast week to the ROC. Requests will be submitted on
         EDWARDSAFB Form 5016, Weekly Aircraft and Air/Ground Support Requirements
         Schedule. Forms must be accurate and complete to ensure timely processing.
         3.3.1.3. Other users. Agencies requesting classified mission support will submit
         requirements by 0800L on the Monday prior to the forecast week to 412 TW
         Scheduling. Submit mission support requirements on EDWARDSAFB Form5016, or
         approved alternate, with the appropriate classification markings.
         3.3.1.4. In order to facilitate a conflict-free schedule, requesting agencies shall de-
         conflict all resources within their unit prior to submitting their schedule to CSE. To
         reduce conflicts, congestion and demand for R-2515’s ASU, units may utilize CSE’s
         Resource Demand Report to view other units’ predicted use of ASU which will aid in
         developing a de-confliction plan to support mission requirements. For local conflicts,
         412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations will notify the involved CTF operations officers
         for resolution. If the operations officers are unable to resolve the conflict,
         412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations will contact the 412 OG/CC, or designated
         representative, for resolution.
     3.3.2. Preliminary Weekly Schedule. The preliminary weekly schedule will be available
     for viewing in CSE to all 412 TW agencies after 1500L Friday, 1 week prior to the
     forecast week. On Tuesday, 1330L 412 TW Scheduling, MX schedulers, CTF schedulers
     and/or directors of operations of CTFs requiring the use of F-16/T-38 aircraft meet to
     develop a priority/de-confliction plan for these assets and required configurations for the
     following week. At the Wednesday, 1200L weekly scheduling meeting, applicable 412
     TW agencies will meet face-to-face to de-conflict and resolve the 412 OG and 412 MXG
     sortie plan, range, ASU areas, aircraft assignment and priority issues IAW AFMCI 21-
     165. In addition to the forecast week, an additional 3-week rolling schedule “look ahead”
     will be previewed. 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations is authorized, in coordination
     with the affected participant, to move mission takeoff times (not to exceed 30 minutes) to
     obtain necessary support. (Note: missions restricted to a specific time must indicate this
     on their schedule requests in CSE under maintenance notes).
EDWARDSAFBI11-115 4 APRIL 2014                                                              15


         3.3.2.1. Prior to submitting an “add-on” to the preliminary weekly schedule or
         slipping an existing scheduled mission, the requesting agency will use the resource
         demand report in CSE to minimize the impact to scheduled missions.
         3.3.2.2. For missions more than one day out from execution, units shall submit
         changes/adds/cancellations to the 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations Org Box
         (412 OSS/OSOS <s531252@us.af.mil>). This box should only be used for
         changes/adds/cancels which do not affect day prior missions. Weekly changes will be
         processed     for      approval/disapproval      at     the     convenience      of
         412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations.
     3.3.3. Weekly Schedule. The weekly schedule will be completed by 1200L on Thursday
     prior to the forecast week and will be approved and signed by 412 OG/CC, 412 MXG/CC
     and 412 TW/CC (or their designated representative). After approval, 412 OSS/OSOS
     Current Operations will publish the weekly schedule.
  3.4. Daily Schedule Operations (Tactical).
     3.4.1. Mission Confirmation Procedures. Missions on the weekly schedule must be
     confirmed by the requesting agency with the 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations
     Scheduler by 1100L on the workday prior to the scheduled operation. Requests for add-
     ons, changes, and cancellations will be accepted up until this time. Any project-generated
     mission cancellation occurring after 1200L is subject to cancellation charges as outlined
     in paragraph 2.21.
     3.4.2. Daily Coordination Procedures.
         3.4.2.1. NLT 1100L, day prior to execution. Prior to 1100L add-ons, major time or
         configuration changes (external tanks, weapons, fuel loads, etc.) may be made. After
         1100L, no add-ons, major time or configuration changes (external tanks, weapons,
         fuel loads, etc.) may be made to the next day’s schedule until the 1300L meeting.
         Cancellations will be accepted anytime.
         3.4.2.2. 1100-1300L, day prior to execution. 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations and
         maintenance schedulers begin de-confliction of the next day’s resources with local
         and off-base agencies. In order to alleviate peak traffic periods and avoid EOR and
         airspace saturation, 412 OSS/OSOS may adjust missions as resources allow to limit
         scheduled departure congestion. Normal limits are 7 simultaneously scheduled
         departures for End of Runway (EOR) support and 10 simultaneously scheduled
         departures for airspace saturation. These adjustments will not result in a loss of
         mission priority.
         3.4.2.3. 1200L, day prior to execution. Any mission resources released after 1200L
         may be charged to the project concerned if subsequent add-on or standby missions do
         not utilize scheduled resources.
         3.4.2.4. 1300L, day prior to execution. Daily meeting for final coordination of next
         day’s schedule. No changes will be accepted after completion of the meeting, without
         an approved AF 2407 (unless exempted by Table 3.2 below). Cancellations will be
         accepted anytime and require an AF 2407. Cancellations after the daily meeting will
         be coordinated to the fullest extent possible, based on the time of cancellation and

          availability of those resource providers (i.e. some offices may already be gone for the
          day).
              3.4.2.4.1. AF 2407 Process. An AF 2407 is required to be processed within CSE
              for any change made after the 1300L daily production meeting to the published
              412 TW weekly or daily schedule involving:

Table 2. Changes that Do Require AF 2407

Adds
Cancellations
Aircraft or configuration changes1
Previously assigned to test or test support changing to training with no
configuration changes (i.e. test to training)
Control room changes of one hour or more
East and/or West range changes of one hour or more
Note:

  Airdrop related changes to the cargo and/or passenger load of the aircraft are
not considered configuration changes and will be coordinated directly with the
412 OSS (see Table 3.2).
              3.4.2.4.2. An AF 2407 is not required for the following (all other changes will be
              coordinated through 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations and/or Real-Time
              Operations as required):

Table 3. Changes that Do Not Require AF 2407
Change to the original printed takeoff time of 30 minutes or less
Replacing scheduled aircraft with published spares
Aircrew changes
Changes to non-exclusive airspace
Airdrop related changes to the cargo and/or passenger load of the aircraft
              3.4.2.4.3. Certain situations which require an AF 2407 require further approval of
              the 412 OG/CC and/or 412 MXG/CC (or their designated representatives):

EDWARDSAFBI11-115 4 APRIL 2014                                                            17


           3.4.2.4.4. The agency requesting the change initiates the AF 2407 and
           coordinates it through the affected Production Supervisor, Munitions Operations,
           Squadron Operations, and Range ODO. All approval/coordination names, dates,
           times will be annotated on the AF 2407.
           3.4.2.4.5. Aircraft configurations will be finalized at the daily maintenance
           production meeting. Configuration changes made after the 1300L daily
           production meeting for the next day’s operations through mission execution
           require an AF 2407 coordinated through the required agencies.
           3.4.2.4.6. All completed AF 2407 will be sent via e-mail in CSE using the “Form
           2407 Distribution List”.
           3.4.2.4.7. 412 OSS/OSOS is responsible for notifying all support agencies of
           requested mission changes, regardless of whether an AF 2407 is required or not.
           412 OSS/OSOS may use the completed AF 2407 to meet some or all of the
           notification requirements in order to prevent duplicate coordination.
           3.4.2.4.8. Deviations. Deviations apply to the approved weekly flying schedule.
           Any change to the approved weekly flying schedule after 1600L Friday the week
           prior will be recorded as a deviation. Use of the AF 2407 does not negate the
           recording of deviations.
        3.4.2.5. 1500L, day prior to execution. 412 OSS/OSOS Current Operations will
        finalize and transfer the next day’s schedule to 412 OSS/OSOS Real-Time
        Operations. Users will input call signs into COOL NLT 1500L. NOTE: No schedule
        adds or changes permitted after 1500L. Adds and changes with 412 OG/CC and 412
        MXG/MOO (for aircraft) or designated representative approval resume at 0600L with
        412 OSS/OSOS Real-Time.
        3.4.2.6. 0600L, day of execution. Add-ons, major time or configuration changes
        (external tanks, weapons, fuel loads, etc.) may be made to the current day’s schedule
        with 412 OG/CC and 412 MXG/MOO (or designated representative) approval. Real-
        time adds must be submitted through CSE. Changes must be telephoned to 412 OSS
        Real-Time. 412 OSS/OSOS Real-Time has the option to request a new mission
        submittal if the change is of such an impact that a formal CSE replacement mission is
        necessary.
     3.4.3. Post-Mission Procedures. After 0900L on the second workday following a
     canceled mission, users may review the test mission cancellation report in CSE for
     applicable data (handle disputes IAW 2.21.2.).
