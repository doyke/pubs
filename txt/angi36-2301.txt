Section B—Officer Professional Military Education (OPME)

3. Architecture. The AF OPME Program is central to a Continuum of Education (COE) that
spans an officer’s career. Beyond pre-commissioning education, which constitutes the first level
of the COE, there are four subsequent levels of OPME:
      3.1. Primary level : The ASBC and Squadron Officer School.
   3.2. Intermediate level : The Air Command and Staff College and its equivalents.
      3.3. Senior level : The Air War College and its equivalents.
   3.4. General/Flag Officer level : CAPSTONE. The Air University Catalog and the
   Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) provide additional details on these
   OPME programs.
4. Resident Programs.
      4.1. Attendance.
         4.1.1. Limited resources restrict attendance at resident OPME. Nonresident programs are
         available to all eligible ANG officers and Title 5 civilians.
         4.1.2. Completing nonresident PME programs will not affect eligibility for resident
         OPME programs at the same level.

       DoD, and non-DoD (international and civilian) PME equivalent programs such as AF
       Fellowships. For further details, refer to AFI 36-2301.
       4.1.5. Officers who have transferred to the ANG from other services may be able to
       receive credit for resident Squadron Officer School (SOS) where applicable. Refer to AFI
       36-2301 Attachment 4 for more information.
   4.2. Eligibility and Prerequisites.
       4.2.1. All officers and Title 5 civilians must meet eligibility and prerequisites described
       in Table 1 below.
       4.2.2. Air Technicians are eligible to apply for the appropriate resident OPME program
       based on military rank and requirements not civil service pay grade.
       4.2.3. Officers who do not successfully complete resident OPME programs for non-
       prejudicial reasons must wait six months from course termination to reapply. Those

         application, and may include accomplishments not listed in other areas and states
         desired goals.
         4.3.2.3. Records Review RIP. Current within 30 days of receipt.
     4.3.3. Intermediate/Senior Service College (ISC/SSC).
         4.3.3.1. Selection to attend resident ISC/SSC is reserved for those officers who will
         hold future leadership positions at the highest levels of the ANG including NGB and
         Joint Staff assignments. Applicants must meet all military standards prior to
         submitting package.
         4.3.3.2. Application procedures and contents of application packages are announced
         by message annually.
         4.3.3.3. In all cases, application packages must be reviewed for completeness by the
         BETM prior to submission through the chain of command. Incomplete packages and
         packages that do not meet announced criteria will not be boarded and will be returned
         without action if they are not completed prior to the board date.
  4.4. Selection Process.
     4.4.1. ASBC applicants are selected on quota availability through appropriate Personnel
     Data System (PDS) transactions. Should the number of applicants warrant it, they will
     meet a board.
     4.4.2. SOS applicants will be reviewed by NGB/HRT for eligibility criteria and selected
     on basis of quota availability. Should the number of applicants warrant it, they will meet
     a board.
     4.4.3. ISC/SSC.
         4.4.3.1. NGB/HR will convene a diverse Review Board to recommend officers
         whose image and performance indicate a high level of potential and success.

         voting members in the rank of Colonel and above. Lieutenant Colonels who have
         completed the equivalent level of OPME are also eligible for Board membership. The
         senior ranking board member will serve as the Board president.
ANGI36-2301 1 JANUARY 2007                                                                     13


         4.4.3.3. Applications will be evaluated on criteria published in the application
         announcement message. Board recommendations, including school assignment, will
         be forwarded to NGB/CF for final approval.
  4.5. School Assignments.
     4.5.1. ASBC class assignments are made based on quota availability in the class(es)
     requested.
     4.5.2. SOS class assignments will be made based on quota availability in the class(es)
     requested.
     4.5.3. ISC/SSC applicants are selected based on the needs of the ANG. Applicants may
     specify school preferences by rank order; however, they may not be selected for their
     preferred school. Restricted quota availability, especially in non-USAF schools,
     frequently limits assignments to applicants’ second or third rank-order choices.
     Consequently, applicants must carefully weigh all options when listing school
     preferences. Selecting only one school significantly limits the applicants’ ability to attend
     resident PME.
  4.6. Notification.
     4.6.1. BETMs are notified of ASBC selectees through transactions in the appropriate
     PDS.
     4.6.2. BETMs are notified of SOS selectees through transactions in the appropriate PDS
     system. Additionally, selectees receive welcome letters and information packages from
     the school 30 days prior to CSD. ISC/SSC selectees are required to attend the ANG
     Orientation. Exceptions will be worked on an individual basis.
     4.6.3. Primary and alternate selectees for ISC/SSC, including school assignment, are
     announced by message. Several schools also provide packages and conduct orientation
     sessions prior to the CSD.
  4.7. Acceptance.
     4.7.1. Unless NGB/HRT is otherwise notified, acceptance of attendance at resident
     OPME requires no action by selectees. Selectees will be contacted by NGB/HRT and
     provided information on the ANG Orientation and short course opportunities. Selectees
     should attend both the Orientation and at least one short course.
  4.8. Non-acceptance.
     4.8.1. An officer may request withdrawal or defer attending resident OPME within 30
     days of notification.
         4.8.1.1. Withdrawal. Selectees may submit a letter or AF IMT 964, PCS, TDY, or
         Training Declination Statement to NGB/HRT requesting withdrawal from attendance
         at resident OPME. All withdrawal requests must be endorsed through the chain-of-
         command including the TAG. Members must submit new application packages for
         future consideration for attendance at resident OPME programs.
         4.8.1.2. Deferral. This action requires a letter of request to NGB/HRT from the
         selectee or the commander with endorsement through the chain-of-command
14                                                           ANGI36-2301 1 JANUARY 2007

           submit a withdrawal letter or accomplish AF IMT 964 as they are not able to take the
           allocation with them.
  4.9. Waivers.
        4.9.1. SOS. Selectees must be in the grade of Captain. Grade waivers will not be
        considered. Waivers for total years of commissioned service (TYCS) will be considered
        on an individual basis.
        4.9.2. ISC/SSC. Grade waivers and deferments must be processed through NGB/HRT to
        offices listed in AFI 36-2301. Waivers for exceeding TYCS limitations and deferments
        will be considered on an individual basis.

        4.12.2. ANGI 36-2101, Assignments Within the Air National Guard, paragraph 5,
        outlines this requirement. See NGB 1212 for an example of the service agreement.
     4.13. Orders.
        4.13.1. ASBC and SOS orders are published as routine school orders, allowing one day
        of travel prior to the (CSD) and one day after class graduation date (CGD).
        4.13.2. Attendance at ISC/SSC schools requires permanent-change-of-station (PCS)
        orders authorized by NGB/HR letters of authority (LOA). Orders will be published, by
        the member’s unit, IAW applicable directives governing PCS moves. Members may not
        attend resident ISC/SSC schools in temporary duty (TDY) status or technician status.
        4.13.3. ISC/SSC programs normally conduct formal orientation sessions. NGB/A1FP
        will notify selectees concerning orientation dates and funding arrangements.
        4.13.4. LOAs will contain the following information as a minimum:
ANGI36-2301 1 JANUARY 2007                                                                 15

      4.13.5. NGB/A1FP provides active duty school days “by name” for all Drill Status
      Guardsmen (DSG) and Air Technicians. These days are to be used only for resident PME
      and must be returned to NGB/A1FP when members cancel attendance or are released
      from resident OPME programs.
   4.14. Disenrollment.
      4.14.1. Resident OPME programs will immediately notify NGB/HRT of all officers
      disenrolled for any reason.

      4.14.3. NGB/HRT will determine disposition of disenrollments for other causes such as
      medical/family emergencies or military operations on a case-by-case basis.
5. Nonresident Programs.
   5.1. Purpose. The purpose of OPME nonresident programs is to provide individuals, who
   have not completed resident OPME, an opportunity to complete it via correspondence,
   seminar, or other approved methods. Headquarters, Air University (HQ AU) is the waiver
   authority for all nonresident eligibility and completion restrictions and limitations.
   5.2. Eligibility.

      officers must complete the appropriate AF OPME course before enrolling in another
      Service’s nonresident program.
 16                                                           ANGI36-2301 1 JANUARY 2007

      5.3. Application.
         5.3.1. Application for nonresident OPME programs is initiated with the BETM. In all
         cases, officers must meet the eligibility criteria for each level of OPME.

Section C—Enlisted Professional Military Education (EPME)

6. Architecture. There are four levels of EPME: ALS, NCOA, SNCOA and Chief Master
Sergeant Leadership Course (CLC). All four levels prepare enlisted members for increased
responsibility. CLC is completed by resident attendance only. ALS, NCOA, and SNCOA may be
completed by distance learning or by attendance at a resident EPME school. The ANG Satellite
ALS and NCOA programs, although a hybrid of the two, are considered resident programs.
7. Resident Programs.
      7.1. Attendance.
         7.1.1. Attendance at a resident EPME program is the preferred method for preparing
         ANG members for roles of greater responsibility, although it is not required. Timing the
         attendance in a member’s career is an integral part of professional development and force
         management decisions. The ANG has developed a long-term strategy that encourages
         commanders to select 50 percent of eligible senior airmen for attendance at a resident
         ALS program.
         7.1.2. Completing nonresident EPME programs will not adversely affect eligibility for

   learning courses. To the extent reasonably possible, EPME nonresident programs mirror the
   resident school curriculum. Headquarters, Air University (HQ AU) is the waiver authority for
   all nonresident eligibility and completion restrictions and limitations.
   8.2. Eligibility.
      8.2.1. Air Force policy stresses taking the right PME at the right time and at the right
      grade. Like resident EPME programs, the nonresident sequence for enlisted personnel is
      ALS, NCOA, and AFSNCOA. Eligibility requirements and criteria are equal for both
      resident and nonresident EPME programs. Refer to Table 2.
      8.2.2. With the exception of those personnel selected to attend resident EPME with
      another Service, ANG enlisted members must complete the appropriate AF EPME course
      before enrolling in another Service’s nonresident program.
      8.2.3. Members who do not successfully complete nonresident EPME programs for
      academic reasons or are withdrawn from a nonresident program for non-completion must
      wait six months from course termination or expiration to reenroll.
      8.2.4. Air technicians must comply with all military requirements for eligibility and
      cannot reenroll based on civil service grade or status.
      8.2.5. Deleted.
      8.2.6. Deleted
   8.3. Application. Application for nonresident EPME programs is initiated with the BETM.
   In all cases, members must meet the eligibility criteria for each level of EPME shown in
   Table 2.
      8.3.1. Initial enrollment in nonresident EPME program must be separated by two years
      between the completion date of the former EPME course and the start date of the next
      higher level EPME course, regardless of method of completion, except for NCOs

         9.2.1. Medical conditions that prevent the applicant from being physically prepared to
         participate in the school’s FTF program or requirement for graduation must be brought to
         the attention of NGB/A1FP once the applicant is selected to attend resident PME.
         9.2.2. Units will not send applicant to resident PME until NGB/A1FP makes a
         determination based on a recommendation made by a competent medical authority.
            9.2.2.1. Members with documented temporary medical restriction (s) that prevent full
            participation in any part of the PME curriculum are ineligible to attend. Restrictions
            must be documented on an AF IMT 422 Physical Profile Serial Report.
            9.2.2.2. BETM stops the process and defers member for a later school date after the
            temporary profile expires.
            9.2.2.3. Members are eligible to attend school when medical condition is resolved
            and there are no restrictions or the AF IMT 422 clearly states that there are no
            restrictions affecting full participation in PME school curriculum.
            9.2.2.4. In rare circumstances the unit commander may request that the member
            attend while on a temporary medical profile due to a mission related reason.
            9.2.2.5. The unit commander provides, to the BETM, a justification letter showing
            mission impact supporting the member's attendance to PME school while on a
            temporary profile.
            9.2.2.6. The BETM reviews and forwards the request to NGB/A1FP PME Program
            Manager with attached AF IMT 422 and recommendation memorandum.
            9.2.2.7. NGB/A1FP PME Program Manager will review/route request package with
            A1FP recommendation to AF/A1DD for final approval.
   9.3. Permanent Physical Profiles.
         9.3.1. Members with permanent profiles are eligible to attend PME Schools.
         9.3.2. A copy of the AF IMT 422 must be sent to the NGB/A1FP PME Program
         Manager for coordination with the applicable PME representative before member departs
         unit to go to school.
