               QUALIFICATIONS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAINING PERSONNEL

3.1. Biomedical Sciences Corps, Rated Officers, and Enlisted Personnel. All personnel assigned for
duty with the Air Force Aerospace Physiology Training Program must be graduates of the Aerospace
Physiology Officer Course or the Aerospace Physiology Apprentice Course. 1TXs assigned to Aerospace
Physiology Training units are not required to attend the Aerospace Physiology Apprentice course, but
must complete upgrade training in aerospace physiology topics and duties to supplement their specialty
training. Upgrade training will be performed locally at their aerospace physiology unit of assignment and
training documentation will be maintained in the individual’s OJT records. Rated aerospace physiologists
assigned to active flying positions should maintain currency in aircraft for which they are qualified. Rated
aerospace physiologists who fly will comply with all aircrew training and operational directives, to
include crew rest, mission planning, preflight, flight time, postflight, maintenance and mission briefings.

3.2. Operational Support Flights. Aerospace physiology personnel receive periodic operational sup-
port flights in aircraft for which they provide training to enable these personnel to better tailor courses to
local flying requirements.
3.2. (AETC) Operational Support Flights. Requirements for familiarization flights are in AFI 11-401,
Aviation Management. Report flying time for all aerospace physiology personnel on the Physiological
Training Monthly Report.

3.3. Medical Examination and Medical Standards. All personnel must meet the flying physical
requirements of AFI 48-123 (ASC 9C - Operational Support). They must take part in regular, frequent
chamber flights as required. Individuals placed in a "duty not involving flying" (DNIF) status will be eval-
uated by the local flight surgeon to determine their fitness to perform outside chamber duties.
3.3. (AETC) Medical Examination and Medical Standards. For other attention-critical tasks, includ-
ing MH-15 ejection seat trainer duty and parachute familiarization (parasail) training duties, the attending
flight surgeon will determine DNIF status limitations and document them on the AF Form 1042, Medical
Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty.

3.4. Platform Instructors. Officer or enlisted instructors giving formal classroom presentations must be
graduates of an Air Force academic instructor course, technical instructor course, or academic instructor
training conducted as a part of the AFSC awarding courses taught at the USAF School of Aerospace Med-
icine.
     3.4.1. Aerospace physiology personnel qualify as platform instructors by meeting MAJCOM, local
     APTF, and Standardization/Evaluation requirements listed in Chapter 12.
     3.4.2. Conduct initial qualification and continued monitoring of physiological training instructors per
     MAJCOM direction and Chapter 12 of this AFI.
     3.4.3. Maintain a file on each individual assigned to hypobaric and/or hyperbaric duties. The file
     should contain, as a minimum, medical and instructor qualifications. For example: AF Form 1042,
     Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty; hazardous duty orders, if avail-
     able, or a letter signed by the individual's commander placing them on chamber duty; AF Form 1256,

   Military Pay Order, etc. Dispose of records according to Air Force directives.

3.5. Personnel Not Directly Assigned to a Chamber Facility. All personnel not directly assigned to a
research or training chamber activity may be attached according to MAJCOM needs to a local research,
APTF or PSPTS by the MAJCOM Coordinator with AFMOA/SGZA approval. If a chamber unit requires
attached personnel to perform inside observer duties during chamber operations, individual requests for
approval will be considered. HPTT personnel will not ordinarily be attached to a chamber unit unless the
MAJCOM coordinator justifies the need. Individual requests must be initiated, in writing, by the host
APTF or PSPTS commander to their MAJCOM Coordinator for approval. Requests must fully justify rea-
sons for using attached personnel (manning shortage, increased training load, etc.) and must state a spe-
cific period of time the attached person is needed. If approved by the MAJCOM Coordinator, the request
must be forwarded to AFMOS/SGZA for final approval. Attached personnel will also respond to the other
needs of the host APTF or PSPTS and must provide services as outlined by AFMOA/SGZA and as
required by the host APTF or PSPTS commander, or research director. This requirement applies to indi-
viduals who meet the following conditions:
3.5. (AETC) Personnel Not Directly Assigned to a Chamber Facility. Use of personnel not directly
assigned to APTFs is at the discretion of the APTF flight commander. The local mission should benefit

                          METHODS USED IN THE TRAINING PROGRAM

5.1. Aerospace Physiological Training Facilities. Aerospace physiology training of US Air Force person-
nel conducted by US Army, US Navy, FAA, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or foreign
countries does not fulfill the requirements of this instruction except as noted in 2.1.5. The Joint Special-
ized Undergraduate Flying Training program conducted at Pensacola fulfills the requirements of this reg-
ulation. Department of Defense (DoD) activities may request to use Air Force physiological training
facilities. The Air Force will provide this training support to US Navy, US Coast Guard, and US Army
organizations according to existing support agreements. All military installations or other DoD activities
may directly communicate with the APTFs for required training. The FAA may ask APTFs to provide
instruction for civilian aircrew personnel according to the USAF and FAA agreement.

5.2. Classroom Lectures. The APTF Commander or 9 PSPTS Commander is responsible for conduct-
ing aerospace physiological training programs. Aerospace physiologists give most classroom lectures.
Fully qualified aerospace physiology technicians, survival, evasion, resistance, escape (SERE) special-
ists, or aircrew life support technicians can provide lectures on the following topics: protective equip-
ment, emergency escape and egress, ejection seat, survival equipment training, and parachuting
techniques. If available, qualified parachutists should give the survival equipment and emergency escape
from aircraft lectures. SERE specialists or aircrew life support instructors may also give high altitude air-
craft survival lectures. Fully qualified aerospace physiology technicians may provide cabin pressurization
and altitude chamber flight lectures. Aerospace physiology training in aircrew life support equipment and
survival is designed to complement training received during initial and recurring aircrew life support con-
tinuation training (ALSCT) events by emphasizing the physiological and human performance aspects of
each curriculum topic. Individuals who have attained a primary AFSC of 4M071 or higher, and an Asso-
ciates Degree or higher may be certified by the local APTF commander to teach the subjects listed in para-
graph 6.1.1. and 6.1.5. Aerospace Physiology Technicians may also be qualified to teach the entire Initial
High Altitude Parachutist (HAP) or HAP Refresher Course provided they have attained a primary AFSC
of 4M071 or higher, hold an associates degree or higher, and have experience in High Altitude Airdrop
Mission Support (HAAMS) operations, qualified as a parachutist, or are certified in HAP oxygen equip-
ment. The APTF commander must provide these technicians additional, comprehensive training to teach
the subjects listed in paragraph 6.1.1., 6.1.2., 6.1.5., 6.1.6., and 6.1.8.. This additional training must be
documented in the individual’s OJT record.
     5.2.1. (Added-AETC) Superior instruction is the standard for AETC APTFs. Personnel who cannot
     achieve (or who fail to maintain) the highest instructor standards should be formally entered into
     retraining by their unit. If acceptable progress is achieved, they may regain their instructor status. If
     acceptable progress is not achieved, they should be decertified as instructors by the APTF flight com-
     mander.
     5.2.2. (Added-AETC) AETC APTFs will conduct bimonthly instructor continuation training. The
     minutes of this training will be maintained for 1 year. All instructors who were absent must read and
     initial the minutes.
     5.2.3. (Added-AETC) Use AETC Form 281, Instructor Evaluation Checklist, to record instructor
     evaluations. Any overall evaluation rating of "needs improvement" requires a followup evaluation
     within 30 days. If a lesson or class containing items needing improvement is not scheduled within 30
AFI11-403_AETCSUP1_I 5 DECEMBER 2003                                                                      23


   days, explain in section IV of the AETC Form 281 and perform a followup evaluation during the next
   scheduled appropriate lesson.

5.3. Training Classes. Classes should be small to stimulate individual participation. Schedule classes to
provide homogeneous groups (e.g., rated and nonrated duties in similar aircraft, crew members perform-
ing duty in the same weapon system category). Recommend the use of locally developed student hand-
outs.

5.4. Qualified Aerospace Physiology Training Technicians. During training, these technicians con-
duct practical demonstrations, as required, in the physiological aspects of:
   5.4.1. The use of oxygen, protective, and survival equipment.
   5.4.2. The use of pressure suits.
   5.4.3. Night vision and night vision goggles.
   5.4.4. Emergency egress from aircraft.
   5.4.5. An aerospace physiologist will annually monitor training activities provided by aerospace
   physiology, aircrew life support, or SERE specialists conducting training classes for the APTF.

5.5. Audiovisual Products . You may use audiovisual products to enhance lectures. However, these do
not take the place of lectures or demonstrations.

5.6. Low-Pressure Chamber Flights. Use low-pressure chamber flights to demonstrate the hazards
associated with changes in barometric pressures and the proper use of protective equipment. These haz-
ards include the symptoms of hypoxia, pressure breathing, mechanical effects of barometric pressure
change, and proper use of oxygen equipment.

5.7. Written Tests. Written tests are required of all Original students. Students need a score of at least 80
percent to pass. You may not use programmed text-type tests that include the correct answers to each
question. The student should review all tests and correct them to 100 percent. Scores below 80 percent
require more instruction and retest. When a retest is required, enter both scores (example 75/95) on AF
Form 699, Physiological Training Record. An aerospace physiologist certifies satisfactory training on
AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record; and AF Form 1274, Physiological Training.
Report personnel who demonstrate inadequate knowledge of the instructed subject to their unit command-
ers and arrange for them to repeat the course of instruction.
5.7. (AETC) Written Tests. Prepare a written test for original (non-UFT) courses and revise them annu-
ally. Maintain two different versions.

                                                 Chapter 7

                                          CHAMBER FLIGHTS

7.1. Supervision of Flights. An officer who meets the qualifications described in Chapter 3 supervises
chamber flights. During all chamber flights, a designated flight surgeon must be able to respond by tele-
phone within two minutes and get to the chamber within 15 minutes.

7.2. Post-flight Restrictions. The following are postflight restrictions for personnel who take part in
chamber flights:
     7.2.1. No physical exercise, strenuous or extended duty for a period of 12 hours.
     7.2.2. Do not assign personnel as flying crew members for at least 12 hours after completion of any
     chamber flight above 25,000 feet.
     7.2.3. Personnel may fly as passengers in aircraft during this period but should remain below a cabin
     altitude of 10,000 feet.
     7.2.4. There is no restriction on flying as a crew member or passenger after a chamber flight to 25,000
     feet or below except that they remain below a cabin altitude of 15,000 feet.

7.3. Chamber Flight Exposures After Diving. Personnel must delay altitude chamber and aerial flight
exposures for at least 24 hours following compressed air diving. This includes SCUBA (self-contained
underwater breathing apparatus) diving, surface supplied diving, or hyperbaric chamber exposure. If the
dive requires a decompression stop, recommend 48 hours elapse prior to aerial flight or altitude chamber
exposure. EXCEPTION: Pararescue and Combat Control personnel assigned to Air Force Special Oper-
ations Command Special Tactics Units will follow guidelines per US Navy Diving Manual, Volumes I and
II, on flying after diving restrictions. Specifically, these divers should not fly for 12 hours after surfacing
from a decompression dive or for two hours following a no decompression dive. If aircraft cabin pressure
is maintained below 2,300 feet altitude, then flying is permitted immediately after any breathing mixture
dive. Flying is permitted immediately after 100-percent oxygen diving.

7.4. Scheduling Requirements. The scheduling base ensures that personnel scheduled for training meet
appropriate medical standards. Means of verification between the Chiefs of Aeromedical Services and
Aerospace Physiology must be established. Trainees should bring their AF Form 702 and appropriate
medical clearances. In the absence of written medical clearance, telephone verification with the trainee's
home medical facility is authorized. This must be annotated on the back of the trainee's AF Form 699.
Print or type the name of the person who verified the clearance. During the chamber preflight briefing, ask
trainees about their current physical status (colds, sinusitis, headaches, abdominal pain, digestive upset,
ear trouble, pregnancy, injuries, etc.). Trainees who have been involved in compressed air diving activities
within the past 24 hours or have donated blood within the past 72 hours cannot participate in chamber
flights. Trainees whose beards, mustaches, or facial cosmetics interfere with a safe oxygen mask fit may
not participate in chamber flights. Refer trainees with physical problems to the flight surgeon. The
required medical clearance forms are:
7.4. (AETC) Scheduling Requirements. Because of JSUFT scheduling constraints and TDY costs
incurred by aircrews from other bases, student training should be scheduled around recurring readiness
AFI11-403_AETCSUP1_I 5 DECEMBER 2003                                                                      29


commitments if possible. Aircrew training will take priority over unscheduled or unannounced organiza-
tional and base exercise requirements.
   7.4.1. For Military Personnel:
       7.4.1.1. Copy of AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational
       Duty, DA (Army) Form 4186, Medical Recommendation for Flying Duty, or Naval Medical
       Form 6410/2, Clearance Notice (Aeromedical), indicating that a flying Class I, II, or III physical
       has been completed for flying personnel or candidates for flying positions. US Coast Guard, US
       Navy, and US Army personnel may present any of the forms previously listed, or may substitute a
       letter from their local flight surgeon certifying a group of trainees' medical fitness for the chamber
       flight. These same forms certify that nonflying personnel meet required medical standards.
       7.4.1.2. US Air Force, Army, or Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets will
       present evidence of satisfactory completion of SF 88, Report of Medical Examination or DD
       Form 2351, Medical Examination Review Board (DODMERB) Report of Medical Examina-
       tion, accomplished within 36 months of the scheduled training. NOTE: Before scheduling cadets
       for training, ROTC detachment must send Aerospace Physiology Training Flight copies of SF 88,
       Report of Medical Examination, and SF 93, Report of Medical History, or DD Form 2351,
       Medical Examination Review Board (DODMERB) Report of Medical Examination, and DD
       Form 2492, Report of Medical History. APTF will have local flight surgeon review these forms
       and stamp them “Qualified to participate in altitude chamber training” for all cadets physi-
       cally qualified. APTF will then contact ROTC detachment and schedule cadets for appropriate
       training.
       7.4.1.3. Exceptions for altitude chamber requirement granted to aircrew following bleomycin
       chemotherapy. AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational
       Duties, will list the following restriction statements in the Remarks block:
       No assignment to aircraft requiring routine use of oxygen equipment. Waiver from altitude cham-
       ber exposure. Ground training without supplemental oxygen is acceptable.
       Annotate the AF Form 699, Physiological Training Record, block 19, Chamber Flight, Type,
       with the following statement: Waived-see back. Annotate the back of the AF Form 699 with the
       following statement: Altitude chamber exposure waived per AF Form 1042 due to Class II-C
       waiver for bleomycin chemotherapy. Annotate AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training
       Record, Remarks block, with the following statement: Chamber flight waived IAW Class II-C
       waiver restrictions.
   7.4.2. For Civilian Personnel:
       7.4.2.1. Those undergoing US Air Force or FAA physiological training chamber profiles must
       present a copy or original of current FAA Form 8402-2, FAA Medical Certificate flying classes I,
       II, or III (dated no more than three years prior to the last day of the current month), or the same
       forms listed in paragraph 7.4.1. indicating that they meet medical standards.

7.5. Course Completion Requirements. Students who do not complete chamber flights within 90 cal-
endar days of academic training must repeat the academics listed in paragraph 6.1.1., paragraph 6.1.3.
paragraph 6.1.4., paragraph 6.1.5. and paragraph 6.1.13. prior to their chamber flight.

7.6. Rates of Ascent and Descent. Rates of ascent and descent for most chamber flights must not exceed
5,000 feet per minute. Exceptions include the rapid descent portions of the Type 2 and Type 3 Flights, the
rapid ascent portion of the Type 1, Type 3 and Type 4 Flights, and emergency operations.

7.7. Maximum Number of Students Authorized on Chamber Flights. The maximum number of stu-
dents on a chamber flight is the maximum number designed to be held by the main chamber or lock com-
partment.

7.8. Inside Observer Requirements. Inside observer (IO) requirements for all initial chamber flights
(Original, HAP, Passenger) are 1 IO for 1 student, 2 IOs for 2-10 students, and 3 IOs for 11 or more stu-
dents. Refresher chamber flights (Type 4) require a 1 IO for 5 or fewer students, and 2 IOs when there are
more than 5 students.

7.9. Chamber Reactor Plan. A hypobaric chamber reactor plan is required that covers the potential
need for hyperbaric oxygen treatment. This plan will include:
     7.9.1. The location, operating hours, telephone numbers, and capabilities of the closest acceptable
     hyperbaric treatment facilities.
     7.9.2. Available means for transporting chamber reactors.
     7.9.3. Location and operation of appropriate oxygen equipment to treat reactor.
     7.9.4. Information relative to contacting the Davis Hyperbaric Laboratory, Brooks AFB TX.

7.10. Chamber Flight Objectives and Demonstrations. The flights described in Attachment 2
through Attachment 6 are performed in low-pressure chambers.
     7.10.1. Hypoxia demonstrations should be conducted within the limits of useful consciousness and
     should not be terminated until all trainees have experienced their hypoxia symptoms. Inside observers
     should encourage students to recover independently, without assistance from observers or other stu-
     dents.
     7.10.2. For hypoxia demonstrations on all refresher flights, masks and regulators should be config-
     ured as they would be in flight, as well as can be simulated. For example, C-130 crewmembers will
     generally have regulators turned ON and 100% O2 selected, and fighter aircrew will generally have
     regulators turned ON and NORMAL O2 selected. Use of quick-don masks should be encouraged for
     those using them operationally. Note that quick-don masks cannot be used during denitrogenation.
     7.10.3. Give a rapid decompression flight to each Original trainee. Objectives include giving the
     trainee practical experience in applying the techniques and principles learned in the classroom to a
     sudden loss of cabin pressure. All personnel must have had an ear and sinus check within two hours
     prior to the rapid decompression flight. You must set the lock compartment at an altitude 500 feet
     above field elevation and the main chamber at an altitude that will generate a 4.5 psi rapid decompres-
     sion. NOTE: Make sure that students are not exposed to a pressure differential greater than 4.7 pounds
     per square inch. If possible, the students should wear the same type of oxygen masks that they will use
     in aerial flight. The students should don their masks before or after the decompression, depending on
     their normal use of oxygen equipment during routine aircraft operations. An aerospace physiologist
     must be immediately available (response time less than 30 seconds). The inside observer gives the
     instruction during the flight.
AFI11-403_AETCSUP1_I 5 DECEMBER 2003                                                                  31


  7.10.4. A flight surgeon must be physically present during all medical evaluation flights. Flight sur-
  geon serves as the medical monitor during these flights. A flight surgeon may accompany a qualified
  inside observer to directly monitor medical evaluation flights. Flight surgeons do not qualify for haz-
  ardous duty incentive pay since these flights are so rarely indicated and therefore the Air Force does
  not consider them a routine and integral part of the flight surgeon's assigned mission.
  7.10.5. Equipment check flights must be conducted (or limited) as required to check the performance
  of chambers, oxygen equipment and protective devices. Hypobaric training chambers must not be
  used to test and evaluate aircrew life support equipment (oxygen regulators, oxygen masks, automatic
  parachute actuators, etc.) involved in physiological incidents or aircraft mishaps. Hypobaric training
  chambers must not be used to conduct research.
  7.10.6. MAJCOMs may develop special flight profiles to meet specific training requirements.
  AFMOA/SGOA must approve these profiles before they are used.
  7.10.7. Demonstration of appropriate hypoxia recovery techniques is a course requirement for all stu-
  dents. Students should be critiqued on their ability to accomplish all required steps for complete
  recovery, to include selecting “ON”, “100% O2”, and “Emergency” pressure on the regulator, putting
  mask on face, checking oxygen systems, and communicating potential problems over the intercom.
  Students who do not demonstrate appropriate hypoxia recovery techniques will be provided additional
  training on the importance of early hypoxia recognition and appropriate treatment steps.
  7.10.8. (Added-AETC) During descent from 10,000 feet on Type 2, 3, and 4 chamber flights, have
  students breathe through the oxygen regulator in the "normal off" and "normal on" configurations (if
  regulators permit). Before the oxygen mask is removed, have the students disconnect their regulator
  hose from the quick-disconnect and practice breathing through the disconnect warning device.
  Emphasize the characteristics of and proper response to these configurations.
  7.10.9. (Added-AETC) T-1A crewmembers should use the T-1A quick-don oxygen masks (Scott
  359-series) to recover from the hypoxia demonstration during their refresher physiological training
  chamber flights.

                                     PRESSURE SUIT TRAINING

8.1. Pressure Suit Training Requirements. Conduct pressure suit training and support for personnel
who routinely fly at 50,000 feet MSL or above. MAJCOMs determine the content of the course in accor-
dance with MAJCOM guidance (e.g., ACCI 11-459, U-2/SR-71 Physiological Support Program). This
training is mandatory when the pressure suit assembly is initially issued and fitted. Individuals must not
take part in any flight while wearing a pressure suit that was not fitted by qualified Air Force physiologi-
cal support personnel.

8.2. Original Pressure Suit Training. Original pressure suit training including survival and aircrew life
support training consists of no less than 16 hours of instruction. Personnel attending this course must have
completed Aerospace Physiology Original Training as outlined in Chapter 6, paragraph 6.1. Individuals
desiring this course must be approved for training by the Aerospace Physiology unit chief prior to being
scheduled (9 PSPTS/CC for Beale AFB or 95 AMDS/SGOT flight commander for Edwards AFB).

8.3. Passenger Pressure Suit Training. Designed for personnel who have a short term need to fly in a
high altitude platform (such as incentive/observer flights). The course is approximately 4 hours in length
and is designed to acquaint individuals with full pressure suit operations and emergency egress. Passenger
pressure suit training is valid for 90 days from the date of completion. There is no Passenger Pressure Suit
Refresher training course. This course does not meet the aircraft specific aerospace physiology refresher
training (i.e., TTB, TARF, etc.) currency requirements.

8.4. Refresher Training. Aircrew who have had original pressure suit training as described in paragraph
8.1. are required to complete refresher pressure suit training every 5 years. This course is only for individ-
uals who have completed original pressure suit training. Pressure suit refresher training must be broad
enough to meet the requirements of Chapter 6, so that pressure suite and routine TARF/TTB refresher
training are accomplished simultaneously. The full pressure suit chamber flight is substituted for the Type
4 refresher flight to complete both the full pressure suit and TARF/TTB refresher course requirements.
Training should include emphasis on both the high altitude and the companion training aircraft.

   9.3.1. The minimum centrifuge crew will consist of an Aerospace Physiology Officer (APO), lec-
   turer, operator, and crew chief. Utilize flight surgeon (FS) in conjunction with emergency medicine
   notification. FS will be notified if an emergency or non-routine medical treatment is required.
   Assigned FS will remain on call during the entire training period, and will be notified via phone and/
   or beeper of a requirement to respond to centrifuge injury. Response time for FS to arrive at Physiol-
   ogy Training Center will not exceed five minutes.
   9.3.2. The Commander of the PTC will establish qualification criteria and procedures for all members
   of a centrifuge crew with the exception of the FS.
   9.3.3. The Chief of Flight Medicine, Holloman AFB will establish qualification criteria and proce-
   dures for Holloman AFB flight surgeons.
   9.3.4. The Commander of the PTC and the Flight Medicine Flight Commander develop and docu-
   ment appropriate initial and refresher training plans defining qualification requirements and proce-
   dures for all centrifuge crew members. Documentation will be maintained as part of the PTC
   Instructor Folder.

9.4. Electrocardiographic Monitoring. Monitor all centrifuge riders with an electrocardiogram except
rated aircrew members participating in training and Holloman PTC personnel in training.

9.5. Training for Other Personnel:

                                      EQUIPMENT REQUIRED

10.1. Authorized Equipment. A list of equipment and supply items authorized for the Aerospace Phys-
iology Program is located at Attachment 7 of this AFI.
   10.1.1. Aerospace Physiology personnel will receive an initial issue of flight equipment to enhance
   the effectiveness and safety of training programs. Each MAJCOM should specify initial issue items
   based on the flying mission they support in the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction. Aerospace
   Physiology Flight Commanders determine the unit’s replacement policy for out of service items.
   Additional equipment will be authorized for use during cold/inclement weather and unit specific oper-
   ations. Refer to Attachment 7 of this instruction. The local Wing may authorize aerospace physiology
   units to use a special duty uniform for hot weather operations (e.g., shorts, squadron or unit T-shirt,
   and cap).
   10.1.1. (AETC) Personnel assigned to AETC APTFs are authorized to wear flight suits while con-
   ducting training and related tasks. These tasks include altitude chamber operations and parachute
   familiarization training as well as oxygen system maintenance and recharging. Initial issue authoriza-
   tion includes two flight suits, one summer-weight nomex flight jacket, one pair of flight gloves, one
   pair of flight boots, one pair of nomex long underwear, and one pair of aviator sunglasses. Aviator
   prescription spectacles are authorized and prescription sunglasses should also be issued based on
   parachute or parasail training and observer requirements.
   10.1.2. (Added-AETC) All life support equipment (helmets, oxygen masks, anti-G suits, etc.) will be
   inspected and maintained in accordance with appropriate technical orders. The sole exception is the
   disassembly and inspection of oxygen masks, which should be done every 120 days.

10.2. Issue or Transfer of Training Devices. AFMOA/SGOA must approve issue or transfer of training
devices. This includes the issue, transfer, or loan of hypobaric (low-pressure) chambers, man-rated hyper-
baric (compression) chambers, ejection seat trainers, spatial disorientation demonstrators, and night
vision trainers. The Ogden Air Logistics Center is the functional manager for funding, procuring, install-
ing, modifying, maintaining, moving, repairing, and storing these controlled items.
10.2. (AETC) Issue or Transfer of Training Devices. Support of aerospace physiology training
devices is essential to the success of the AETC and Air Force aerospace physiology programs. These pro-
grams requires support by unit, wing, and depot maintenance agencies. Although some training devices
may have the appearance of being mobile (vertigon, egress procedural trainers, barany chair, etc.), they
were not designed or fabricated to be moved frequently or to locations away from the APTUs. In fact,
movement of these devices away from the APTUs is not authorized.

10.3. Configuration Control Board. The Configuration Control Board (CCB) for hypobaric and hyper-
baric chambers, ejection seat trainers (MH-15/T-43) and spatial disorientation trainers is AFMOA/SGOA.
You will not require separate MAJCOM CCB action for modifications to these controlled items.
10.4. (Added-AETC) Equipment Responsibilities of Logistics Group Commanders. The logistics
group commander (or the maintenance authority at contract maintenance locations) will:

     10.4.1. (Added-AETC) Furnish intermediate-level maintenance support that is beyond the capability
     of the aerospace physiology training technicians.
     10.4.2. (Added-AETC) Furnish bench stock, supply expediting, and repair cycle asset support.
     10.4.3. (Added-AETC) Provide quality control and maintenance analysis support and technical assis-
     tance for maintenance of forms, material, and publications deficiency reporting.
10.5. (Added-AETC) Equipment Responsibilities of the Base Civil Engineer. The base civil engi-
neer will:
     10.5.1. (Added-AETC) Establish accountability for parachute SLTs, LDTs, hanging harness trainers,
     and PLF platforms as real property installed equipment according to AFI 32-9005, Real Property
     Accountability and Reporting.
     10.5.2. (Added-AETC) Maintain the parachute familiarization training (parasail) field according to
     AETCI 36-2224, Procedures for Parachute Familiarization Training (PFT).
     10.5.3. (Added-AETC) Conduct the semiannual inspections and maintenance of the devices in para-
     graph 10.5.1. (Added) Periodic inspections will include the structural integrity of these devices, all
     rigging (pulleys, cables, and ropes), platforms, safety rails, stairs, and PLF pits.
     10.5.4. (Added-AETC) Carefully inspect SLT cables. (NOTE: Stainless steel cable is not very flexi-
     ble and is difficult to determine wear. It should be replaced with 637 cable because each individual
     strand of wire that makes up the entire cable is thinner, thus increasing overall flexibility.)
     10.5.5. (Added-AETC) To replace current bushing pulleys, install pulleys with sealed bearings. (The
     latter operate more smoothly and require no maintenance.)
     10.5.6. (Added-AETC) Inspect all U-loops and mounting brackets for cracks and wear and replace or
     reweld them as needed. When replacing U-loops, install larger (1/4") diameter loops.
     10.5.7. (Added-AETC) Construct or replace trainer platforms and stairs with nonskid metal corru-
     gated decking material to enhance safety and minimize future maintenance requirements. Aerospace
     physiology personnel are responsible for the cleanliness and daily inspections of these facilities and
     related equipment. When the needed support functions are operated under civilian contract, APTUs
     will assure adequate support is provided in the contract performance requirements.

                    CURRICULUM AND TRAINING STANDARDS PROGRAM

12.1. Goals. The goals of this program are to ensure:
     12.1.1. All aircrew training courses, listed in Chapter 2, are made available to APTFs and HPTTs in
     a standardized curriculum format.
     12.1.2. Outside evaluations of units, flights, or training teams conducting standardized curriculum
     courses are accomplished as described in this chapter.
     12.1.3. APTF and HPTT personnel are meeting the approved standardized objectives and appropri-
     ately utilizing courseware only in support of AFI 11-403 standardized curriculum courses. (Note:
     While squadron, safety, and other HPTT specialized briefings may include the same subject material
     the presentation must be tailored to mission specific needs in order to avoid redundant training dur-
     ing aircrew refreshers.)
     12.1.4. Qualified personnel conduct the presentation of the standardized curriculum.
     12.1.5. Flight commanders and HPTT coordinators are educating personnel on the requirements and
     responsibilities of the Curriculum and Training Standards Program and are conducting an in-house
     evaluation program as described in this chapter.
     12.1.6. Standardized curriculum courses are taught separately. (Note: Operational needs may dictate
     the combining of students requiring different standardized courses on rare occasions. All course
     objectives must be met for each group when combining of students is unavoidable.)
     12.1.7. APTFs and HPTTs are improving the quality of aircrew training and customer satisfaction
     through continuous improvement of courseware, instructor proficiency, and operational performance.
     (Note: This applies to all aspects of aerospace physiology, human performance enhancement, AFI
     11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM), and AFMAN 11-210, Vol. I, Instrument
     Refresher Course, training conducted by aerospace physiology personnel.)

12.2. Responsibilities:
     12.2.1. Biomedical Science Corps (BSC) Chief of Aerospace Physiology is responsible for the USAF
     Aerospace Physiology Curriculum and Training Standards Program (hereafter referred to as Curricu-
     lum and Training Standards Program). The BSC Chief also appoints a Curriculum and Training Stan-
     dards Program Coordinator, directs the frequency of evaluation (normally biennially) and provides
     program funding.
     12.2.2. Curriculum and Training Standards Program Coordinator is responsible for managing the
     Curriculum and Training Standards Program to include scheduling evaluators, allocating TDY funds,
     and providing program status reports to the BSC Chief of Aerospace Physiology. Also the Curriculum
     and Training Standards Program Coordinator is responsible for developing, maintaining, and distrib-
     uting the Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluation Checklist.
     12.2.3. MAJCOM/HPTT Coordinators for Aerospace Physiology are responsible for compliance and

  the Curriculum and Training Standards Program. Commanders also have the following responsibili-
  ties.
     12.2.4.1. Commanders ensure instructor evaluations done on instructors teaching standardized
     curriculum subjects are completed at least annually on each instructor for the purposes of the Cur-
     riculum and Training Standards Program and that the evaluations are documented on a compre-
     hensive instructor evaluation form; examples, AETC Form 281 (Instructor Evaluation Checklist),
     AETC Form 620 (Academic Instructor Monitoring Checklist), or comparable form. On each stan-
     dardized curriculum instructor evaluation completed, a specific comment must be made as to the
     instructor’s compliance with standardized curriculum objectives for that subject. Note: The Cur-
     riculum and Training Standards Program compliments but does not replace any other regulatory
     requirements for initial subject area evaluations/certifications of a new instructor or a requirement
     for more frequent evaluations.
     12.2.4.2. Commanders will ensure that instructors not meeting the objectives of the standardized
     curriculum are de-certified from teaching standardized curriculum courses. Commanders will tai-
     lor and document the re-certification process specific to the individual instructors needs. The com-
     mander will maintain re-certification documentation in the individual’s instructor folder.
     12.2.4.3. Commanders will ensure Course Change Requests (CCRs) are submitted to the Curric-
     ulum and Training Standards Program Coordinator when recommending changes in course objec-
     tives, presenting for adoption new ideas in curriculum presentation, noting curriculum
     deficiencies, or making curriculum corrections. Do not accumulate CCRs to send in as a group
     before the yearly curriculum review, send in CCRs when they are generated. Maintain copies of
     submitted CCR’s until the next standardized curriculum update is received from the Curriculum
     and Training Standards Program Coordinator.
     12.2.4.4. Commanders will forward requests for copies of AFI 11-403 standardized courseware
     and training materials from outside the AF Aerospace Physiology field to the BSC Chief of Aero-

     12.2.5. HPTT officers not assigned to an APTF will ensure compliance with the goals of the Curric-
     ulum and Training Standards Program. HPTT officers not assigned to an APTF also have the follow-
     ing responsibilities.
        12.2.5.1. HPTT officers, in conference with their Command Coordinator, will review and docu-
        ment, at least annually, how they are meeting the objectives of the Curriculum and Training Pro-
        gram.
        12.2.5.2. HPTT personnel not assigned to an APTF who teach standardized curriculum subjects
        may extend the instructor evaluation requirement from one to every two years. The enlisted mem-
        ber of the team or a local formal training instructor may evaluate the HPTT officer for the pur-
        poses of the Curriculum and Training Standards Program. Use a comprehensive instructor
        evaluation form; examples, AETC Form 281 (Instructor Evaluation Checklist), AETC Form 620
        (Academic Instructor Monitoring Checklist), or comparable form. On each standardized curricu-
        lum instructor evaluation completed, a specific comment must be made as to the instructor’s com-
        pliance with standardized curriculum objectives for that subject. Note: The Curriculum and
        Training Standards Program compliments but does not replace any other regulatory requirements
        for initial subject area evaluations/certifications of a new instructor or a requirement for more fre-
        quent evaluations.
        12.2.5.3. HPTT personnel will ensure Course Change Requests (CCRs) are submitted to the Cur-
        riculum and Training Standards Program Coordinator when recommending changes in course
        objectives, presenting for adoption new ideas in curriculum presentation, noting curriculum defi-
        ciencies, or making curriculum corrections. Do not accumulate CCRs to send in as a group before
        the yearly curriculum review, send in CCRs when they are generated. Maintain copies of submit-
        ted CCR’s until the next standardized curriculum update is received from the Curriculum and
        Training Standards Program Coordinator.
        12.2.5.4. HPTT personnel will forward requests for copies of AFI 11-403 standardized
        courseware and training materials from outside the AF Aerospace Physiology field to the BSC
        Chief of Aerospace Physiology for release authorization.
     12.2.6. USAFSAM conducts and funds an annual Utilization & Training Workshop. Select MAJ-
     COM representatives will attend this meeting to update standardized courseware. Current AF/XOOT
     operational focus, initiatives and needs will drive aerospace physiology courseware development,
     modification and presentation.
        12.2.6.1. One officer or one enlisted member will perform Stan/Eval inspections unless USAF-
        SAM/FP determines the need for more than one person. Inspectors are responsible for inspection,
        evaluation, and outbrief of designated Medical Group personnel (see paragraph 12.7.). Inspectors
        will document the APTF evaluation and forward a copy to the respective MAJCOM Coordinator
        and USAFSAM/FP following the outbrief.

12.3. Types of Evaluations:
     12.3.1. Annual Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluation. Locally evaluates all APTFs
     annually using the Curriculum and Training Standards Program Checklist to ensure compliance with
     all facets of the standardized training program. This evaluation is the responsibility of each APTF unit
     commander and will be conducted within 60 days of assignment and at least annually thereafter.
AFI11-403_AETCSUP1_I 5 DECEMBER 2003                                                                43


   12.3.2. Annual Instructor Evaluation. All APTF instructors will be evaluated at least annually (see
   paragraph 12.2.4.1.). The APTF commander is responsible for these evaluations. Evaluations will
   occur not later than 13 calendar months from the last evaluation for instructors currently teaching
   standardized curriculum. Previously qualified standardized curriculum instructors who are returning
   to teaching of standardized curriculum will be evaluated on one or more of the standardized curricu-
   lum hours as determined by the APTF commander.
   12.3.3. Directed Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluation. One aerospace physiology
   officer and one aerospace physiology enlisted member, both from outside the inspected APTF, will
   perform AFMOA/MAJCOM Directed Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluations.
   These evaluations supplement the Annual Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluations
   and will be conducted on a biennial basis or as directed by AFMOA or MAJCOM. Inspectors are
   responsible for assessing the APTFs’ Curriculum and Training Standards Program and for the outbrief
   of designated Medical Group personnel (see paragraph 12.6.). The Curriculum and Training Standards
   Program evaluator will review local evaluations and may reevaluate any instructor at the evaluator’s
   discretion. Inspectors will document the APTF evaluation and forward a copy to the respective MAJ-
   COM Coordinator and the Curriculum and Training Standards Program Coordinator following the
   outbrief.

12.4. Scheduling of Directed Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluations.
   12.4.1. Curriculum and Training Standards Program coordinator will work with the BSC Chief of
   Aerospace Physiology and MAJCOM Coordinators to establish evaluation dates for APTFs. On-site
   inspections of an HPTT location will be conducted as requested by the MAJCOM Coordinator and if
   approved by the BSC Chief of Aerospace Physiology.
   12.4.2. Curriculum and Training Standards Program coordinator will provide fund cites and assign
   inspectors. The duration of evaluations should not exceed 3 training days.

12.5. Reporting Criteria for Directed Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluations.
   12.5.1. Follow the grading instructions on the “Curriculum and Training Standards Program Check-
   list.” A copy of this checklist is available on the USAFSAM Aerospace Physiology web site. A hard
   copy may also be requested from the Curriculum and Training Standards Program Coordinator.
   12.5.2. The evaluator’s report will begin with an overall evaluation summary that may be as short as
   one paragraph, but no longer than one page. Use one of the statements provided with the checklist to
   begin the evaluation summary. Next, the report body will list and explain checklist discrepancies;
   each discrepancy will be followed by a recommendation. There is no limit to the number of pages in
   the report body. Additional information may be included in the overall assessment to highlight the
   inspector’s view on what was discovered (i.e. outstanding individual efforts, items to benchmark, or
   areas of concern). DO NOT attach worksheets or the Curriculum and Training Standards Program
   checklist to the final report.

12.6. Outbrief for Directed Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluations. W h e n a
Directed Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluation is conducted the Curriculum and Train-
ing Standards Program evaluator will conduct a formal outbrief with the APTF commander and APTF
Superintendent and, as appropriate or requested, to the Medical Squadron Commander, and the Medical
Group Commander. Outbrief preparation involves data collection, grading, reference materials, required

A2.1. Type 1 Hypobaric Chamber Flight Goals. Designed to give Original trainees practical experi-
ence in applying the techniques and principles learned in the classroom to an accidental loss of cabin pres-
sure. Additional objectives include:
     A2.1.1. Understanding pressurization schedules.
     A2.1.2. Selecting the advantages and disadvantages of pressurization systems.
     A2.1.3. Identifying factors that control the rate of decompression.
     A2.1.4. Determining the physical indications and physiological effects of a rapid decompression.
     A2.1.5. Enhancing trainees' confidence in their ability to effectively function in the event of aircraft
     decompression.
     A2.1.6. Identify the oxygen equipment emergency procedures following a rapid decompression.
NOTE: Additional objectives may be included based on MAJCOM requirements.

A2.2. Preflight Briefing. The instructor tells the trainees the purpose and the procedures of the flight.
The chamber flight should not exceed 15 minutes. All chamber time should be used for training activities.
The instructor explains why, in pressurized aircraft, the oxygen is regulated with the setting on “Normal”
unless conditions of the flight dictate the use of 100-percent oxygen.

A2.3. Simulated Flight in Low-Pressure Chamber Procedures (Time in Min utes--8-10 Minutes
Total):
     A2.3.1. During mask fitting, preflight check of oxygen equipment, and intercommunication check,
     have trainees don oxygen masks with regulator set at "100-percent oxygen."
     A2.3.2. During the ear and sinus check, ascend 5,000 feet and descend to ground level at a rate not to
     exceed 5,000 feet per minute. (Ear and sinus check is normally completed as a large group in the main
     chamber.) Students and inside observers exit chamber following ear and sinus check. Divide students
     into appropriate groups in preparation for the rapid decompression flights.
     A2.3.3. Set the main chamber at the altitude determined to achieve a 4.5 psi rapid decompression for
     your field elevation while the inside observer seats the students in the lock compartment.
     A2.3.4. The inside observer instructs the students to preflight their oxygen equipment and follows
     with a communication check: student’s name and number.
     A2.3.5. If possible, the students should wear the same type of mask they will use during aircraft flight
     and should wear the masks as they do during routine flight. Those that fly without a mask should not
     have the mask connected before the rapid decompression.
     A2.3.6. Inside observer instructs the lock operator to ascend to 500 feet above field elevation or until
     a good door seal is achieved. Inside observer discusses indications of a rapid decompression and
     proper rapid decompression recovery procedures.
     A2.3.7. Inside observer signals the lock operator to fire the rapid decompression.
AFI11-403_AETCSUP1_I 5 DECEMBER 2003                                                                      49


   A2.3.8. Lock observer monitors student recovery procedures and corrects if necessary, then directs
   lock operator to descend to ground level.
   A2.3.9. Inside observer reviews procedures for preventing/treating ear and sinus blocks and reviews
   effects of decompression.
   A2.3.10. At 10,000 feet, inside observer directs students to remove masks.
   A2.3.11. Review flight with trainees.

A2.4. Postflight Briefing. Review the chamber flight to emphasize learning outcomes. Give the trainees
instructions to follow in case they experience any type of delayed reactions. Brief them on restrictions fol-
lowing chamber flights (see paragraph 7.2.).

   A6.3.4. During ascent to 17,500 feet discuss decompression phenomena using training aids to dem-
   onstrate mechanisms. Discuss differences in hypoxia symptoms for mild hypoxia versus severe
   hypoxia. Emphasize the insidious nature of mild hypoxia symptoms.
   A6.3.5. During ascent and subsequent time at 17,500 feet, trainees experience hypoxia within the
   limits of useful consciousness. At the 30 minutes after passing through 10,000 feet MSL, direct all
   trainees who have not already donned oxygen equipment and corrected for hypoxia to do so. Trainees
   resume breathing oxygen and are confirmed to be fully recovered before starting next demonstration.

     A6.3.6. While remaining at 17,500 feet, have trainees remove masks and experience mild hypoxia in
     preparation for visual acuity demonstration.
     A6.3.7. At 17,500 feet, use visual aids to demonstrate effects of hypoxia on night visual acuity.
     A6.3.8. Descend to 10,000 feet while breathing normal oxygen. After descent below 10,000 feet,
     oxygen masks may be disconnected and descent continued to ground level breathing air.
     A6.3.9. Practice using emergency and/or portable oxygen equipment as appropriate during the cham-
     ber flight. Review walk-around cylinder recharging. Discuss the need for ventilating middle ears after
     flights using oxygen.
     A6.3.10. Review flight and answer questions.

A6.4. Postflight Briefing. Same as Type 2 Flight (see paragraph A3.4.).

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision further defines the role of the Human Performance Training Teams; explains the changes in
cadet, High Altitude Parachute (HAP), and refresher aerospace physiological training expiration dates;
outlines authorized training units, clarifies medical qualifications for civilian trainees; adds Chapter 12,
Curriculum and Training Standards Program.
1.1.1.4. To develop and field Human Performance Training Teams (HPTT) to provide human factor and
performance support for the warfighting community.
1.2. MAJCOM headquarters should support the regulatory, technical, and resource needs of the following
(note that programs within line organizations may be funded through line channels): USAF Aerospace
Physiology Programs, MAJCOM Aerospace Physiology Program, MAJCOM Human Performance Train-
ing Team Program, MAJCOM Aerospace Physiology Personnel, MAJCOM Aerospace Physiology Facil-
ities and Equipment, MAJCOM High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support Program, MAJCOM Centrifuge

70                                                     AFI11-403_AETCSUP1_I 5 DECEMBER 2003


1.7.7. Provides consultations and training of fatigue-countermeasure tools at the operational Wing, Group
and Squadron levels.
1.7.8. Complies with duty requirements specified in AFMAN 36-2105 and AFMAN 36-2108.
2.1.2. High Altitude Parachutist (HAP) Initial Training. HAP initial training is provided to qualified jump
rated personnel participating in parachute operations above 10,000 feet MSL as required by Air Force,
MAJCOM, US Army, or US Navy directives. In isolated circumstances, when HAP initial students cannot
be trained as a homogenous group refer to paragraph 6.2.3. for training requirements. Students completing
HAP initial training are certified for 5 years and recertify by completing refresher training as described in
paragraph 2.1.4. Exceptions to training described in 2.1.4.1. and 2.1.5.1. apply to parachutists.
2.1.3. Officer Cadet Initial Training. Designed to provide initial aerospace physiology training to meet the
specific needs of USAFA cadets and ROTC cadets in their flying programs. Students completing officer
cadet initial training are certified for 4 years, but cannot be recertified by completing refresher training.
NOTE: Training remains valid after graduation until expiration date.
2.1.4. Refresher Training. Designed to recertify training for original, HAP initial, and refresher training.
All flying personnel must complete refresher training once every five years (this applies to training con-
ducted on or after 1 Oct 98), unless they are exempted by this instruction or by AFI 11-202 Vol 1, Aircrew
Training. The expiration date is the last day of the month in which training is required. For example, if the
last training was conducted on 19 October 1998, the next training is due not later than 21 October 2003.
Those who are delinquent in the training will not fly and could be subject to disqualification IAW AFI
11-402. NOTE: Aircrew who received a one-year extension prior to 1 Oct 98 due to an assignment in
European and Middle Eastern theaters must complete refresher training at the end of their extension.
2.1.4.1. Training Requirements Before Returning to Active Flying Status. Personnel in inactive status are
not required to complete physiological training (AFI 11-202, Vol 1). Aircrew members returning to active
status must complete refresher physiological training prior to resuming active flying if their previous
training has expired.
2.1.5.3. Aircrew required to wear pressure suits for high altitude operations complete refresher training
every 5 years as described in paragraph 8.4.
2.1.5.7. Personnel Returning from Overseas. If physiological training currency should expire during the
three months prior to the Permanent Change of Station (PCS) month and training can not be attained, then
the member’s training currency is extended by three months past the return to CONUS. This will allow
the member to accomplish training upon return to CONUS without interrupting the flying schedule of
either the gaining or losing wing.
2.1.5.8. Non-USAF parachutists may attend the US Navy HAHO/HALO course (NP6) in lieu of the
USAF HAP initial course.
2.1.5.9. Physiology training is waived during pregnancy. Waiver must be applied for IAW AFI 48-123,
Medical Examination and Standards, paragraph A7.22.1.1.
2.4. Personnel Who Must Complete Refresher Training Before Permanent Change of Station (PCS)
to an Overseas Location. All flying personnel being assigned to an active flying assignment overseas
must complete refresher physiological training so that currency will not expire during their overseas tour.
Personnel returning to CONUS can follow the guidance in stated in 2.1.5.7.
AFI11-403_AETCSUP1_I 5 DECEMBER 2003                                                                     71


2.6. Waiver requests. Request for waivers to this instruction should be directed to Chief, Aerospace
Physiology (or his/her designee), AFMOA/SGZA, 110 Luke Avenue, Room 405, Bolling AFB, DC
20332-7050, DSN 297-4200, Commercial (202) 767-4200, FAX DSN 754-8089, FAX Commercial
(202) 404-8089.
3.5. Personnel Not Directly Assigned to a Chamber Facility. All personnel not directly assigned to a
research or training chamber activity may be attached according to MAJCOM needs to a local research,
APTF or PSPTS by the MAJCOM Coordinator with AFMOA/SGZA approval. If a chamber unit requires
attached personnel to perform inside observer duties during chamber operations, individual requests for
approval will be considered. HPTT personnel will not ordinarily be attached to a chamber unit unless the
MAJCOM coordinator justifies the need. Individual requests must be initiated, in writing, by the host
APTF or PSPTS commander to their MAJCOM Coordinator for approval. Requests must fully justify rea-
sons for using attached personnel (manning shortage, increased training load, etc.) and must state a spe-
cific period of time the attached person is needed. If approved by the MAJCOM Coordinator, the request
must be forwarded to AFMOS/SGZA for final approval. Attached personnel will also respond to the other
needs of the host APTF or PSPTS and must provide services as outlined by AFMOA/SGZA and as
required by the host APTF or PSPTS commander, or research director. This requirement applies to indi-
viduals who meet the following conditions:
3.6.3. APTFs performing a flying and or parachute mission (EXAMPLE: HAAMS, parasail training and
test parachute jumps) must project needed quotas to Airborne (Parachutist), Combat Survival Training
and Water Survival-Parachuting courses annually. APTFs supporting HAAMS should schedule their para-
chute qualified personnel to attend the Military Freefall Parachutist Course.
5.1. Aerospace Physiological Training Facilities. Aerospace physiology training of US Air Force person-
nel conducted by US Army, US Navy, FAA, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or foreign
countries does not fulfill the requirements of this instruction except as noted in 2.1.5. The Joint Special-
ized Undergraduate Flying Training program conducted at Pensacola fulfills the requirements of this reg-
ulation. Department of Defense (DoD) activities may request to use Air Force physiological training
facilities. The Air Force will provide this training support to US Navy, US Coast Guard, and US Army
organizations according to existing support agreements. All military installations or other DoD activities
may directly communicate with the APTFs for required training. The FAA may ask APTFs to provide
instruction for civilian aircrew personnel according to the USAF and FAA agreement.
6.1.7. Spatial Disorientation and Other Sensory Phenomena. Teaches how the body orients itself on the
ground and compares this with the effects of flight. Teaches the characteristics and specific examples of
Types 1, 2 and 3 spatial disorientation. Includes an explanation of the central and peripheral visual modes
and their effects on orientation. Addresses illusions derived from vision, semicircular canals and otolith
organs to include the G excess effect. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) will be addressed to those aircrews
whose unit mission includes their use, emphasizing their use, adjustment, illusions and perceptual prob-
lems. Covers problems associated with motion sickness. This training for refresher students is required
only for pilots, navigators, flight surgeons, aerospace physiologists, flight engineers, boom operators,
loadmasters, and aerial gunners. All JSUPT students and navigator students entering the fighter/attack
track after initial flight training are given a ride in a spatial disorientation demonstrator.
7.4.2.1. Those undergoing US Air Force or FAA physiological training chamber profiles must present a
copy or original of current FAA Form 8402-2, FAA Medical Certificate flying classes I, II, or III (dated

8.4. Refresher Training. Aircrew who have had original pressure suit training as described in paragraph
8.1. are required to complete refresher pressure suit training every 5 years. This course is only for individ-
uals who have completed original pressure suit training. Pressure suit refresher training must be broad
enough to meet the requirements of Chapter 6, so that pressure suite and routine TARF/TTB refresher
training are accomplished simultaneously. The full pressure suit chamber flight is substituted for the Type
4 refresher flight to complete both the full pressure suit and TARF/TTB refresher course requirements.
Training should include emphasis on both the high altitude and the companion training aircraft.

CURRICULUM AND TRAINING STANDARDS PROGRAM
12.1.1. All aircrew training courses, listed in Chapter 2, are made available to APTFs and HPTTs in a
standardized curriculum format.
12.1.2. Outside evaluations of units, flights, or training teams conducting standardized curriculum courses
are accomplished as described in this chapter.
12.1.3. APTF and HPTT personnel are meeting the approved standardized objectives and appropriately
utilizing courseware only in support of AFI 11-403 standardized curriculum courses. (Note: While squad-
ron, safety, and other HPTT specialized briefings may include the same subject material the presentation
must be tailored to mission specific needs in order to avoid redundant training during aircrew refreshers.)
12.1.4. Qualified personnel conduct the presentation of the standardized curriculum.
12.1.5. Flight commanders and HPTT coordinators are educating personnel on the requirements and
responsibilities of the Curriculum and Training Standards Program and are conducting an in-house evalu-
ation program as described in this chapter.
 12.1.6. Standardized curriculum courses are taught separately. (Note: Operational needs may dictate the
combining of students requiring different standardized courses on rare occasions. All course objectives
must be met for each group when combining of students is unavoidable.)
12.1.7. APTFs and HPTTs are improving the quality of aircrew training and customer satisfaction through
continuous improvement of courseware, instructor proficiency, and operational performance. (Note: This
applies to all aspects of aerospace physiology, human performance enhancement, AFI 11-290, Cockpit/

least annually, how they are meeting the objectives of the Curriculum and Training Program.
12.2.5.2. HPTT personnel not assigned to an APTF who teach standardized curriculum subjects may
extend the instructor evaluation requirement from one to every two years. The enlisted member of the
team or a local formal training instructor may evaluate the HPTT officer for the purposes of the Curricu-
lum and Training Standards Program. Use a comprehensive instructor evaluation form; examples, AETC
Form 281 (Instructor Evaluation Checklist), AETC Form 620 (Academic Instructor Monitoring Check-
list), or comparable form. On each standardized curriculum instructor evaluation completed, a specific
comment must be made as to the instructor’s compliance with standardized curriculum objectives for that
subject. Note: The Curriculum and Training Standards Program compliments but does not replace any
other regulatory requirements for initial subject area evaluations/certifications of a new instructor or a
requirement for more frequent evaluations.
12.2.5.3. HPTT personnel will ensure Course Change Requests (CCRs) are submitted to the Curriculum
and Training Standards Program Coordinator when recommending changes in course objectives, present-
ing for adoption new ideas in curriculum presentation, noting curriculum deficiencies, or making curricu-
lum corrections. Do not accumulate CCRs to send in as a group before the yearly curriculum review, send
in CCRs when they are generated. Maintain copies of submitted CCR’s until the next standardized curric-
ulum update is received from the Curriculum and Training Standards Program Coordinator.

annually using the Curriculum and Training Standards Program Checklist to ensure compliance with all
AFI11-403_AETCSUP1_I 5 DECEMBER 2003                                                                    75


facets of the standardized training program. This evaluation is the responsibility of each APTF unit com-
mander and will be conducted within 60 days of assignment and at least annually thereafter.
12.3.2. Annual Instructor Evaluation. All APTF instructors will be evaluated at least annually (see para-
graph 12.2.4.1.). The APTF commander is responsible for these evaluations. Evaluations will occur not
later than 13 calendar months from the last evaluation for instructors currently teaching standardized cur-
riculum. Previously qualified standardized curriculum instructors who are returning to teaching of stan-
dardized curriculum will be evaluated on one or more of the standardized curriculum hours as determined
by the APTF commander.
12.3.3. Directed Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluation. One aerospace physiology
officer and one aerospace physiology enlisted member, both from outside the inspected APTF, will per-
form AFMOA/MAJCOM Directed Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluations. These eval-
uations supplement the Annual Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluations and will be
conducted on a biennial basis or as directed by AFMOA or MAJCOM. Inspectors are responsible for
assessing the APTFs’ Curriculum and Training Standards Program and for the outbrief of designated
Medical Group personnel (see paragraph 12.6.). The Curriculum and Training Standards Program evalua-
tor will review local evaluations and may reevaluate any instructor at the evaluator’s discretion. Inspec-
tors will document the APTF evaluation and forward a copy to the respective MAJCOM Coordinator and
the Curriculum and Training Standards Program Coordinator following the outbrief.
12.4. Scheduling of Directed Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluations.
12.4.1. Curriculum and Training Standards Program coordinator will work with the BSC Chief of Aero-
space Physiology and MAJCOM Coordinators to establish evaluation dates for APTFs. On-site inspec-
tions of an HPTT location will be conducted as requested by the MAJCOM Coordinator and if approved
by the BSC Chief of Aerospace Physiology.
12.4.2. Curriculum and Training Standards Program coordinator will provide fund cites and assign
inspectors. The duration of evaluations should not exceed 3 training days.
12.5. Reporting Criteria for Directed Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluations.
12.5.1. Follow the grading instructions on the “Curriculum and Training Standards Program Checklist.” A
copy of this checklist is available on the USAFSAM Aerospace Physiology web site. A hard copy may
also be requested from the Curriculum and Training Standards Program Coordinator.
12.5.2. The evaluator’s report will begin with an overall evaluation summary that may be as short as one
paragraph, but no longer than one page. Use one of the statements provided with the checklist to begin the
evaluation summary. Next, the report body will list and explain checklist discrepancies; each discrepancy
will be followed by a recommendation. There is no limit to the number of pages in the report body. Addi-
tional information may be included in the overall assessment to highlight the inspector’s view on what
was discovered (i.e. outstanding individual efforts, items to benchmark, or areas of concern). DO NOT
attach worksheets or the Curriculum and Training Standards Program checklist to the final report.
12.6. Outbrief for Directed Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluations. When a
Directed Curriculum and Training Standards Program Evaluation is conducted the Curriculum and Train-
ing Standards Program evaluator will conduct a formal outbrief with the APTF commander and APTF
Superintendent and, as appropriate or requested, to the Medical Squadron Commander, and the Medical
Group Commander. Outbrief preparation involves data collection, grading, reference materials, required

follow-up actions, and preparation of any Standards Program evaluation reports. The inspectors must
cover performance and compliance with standardized objectives in detail.
12.7. Administration of Directed Standardization Program Evaluations. Inspectors will assemble
their report according to the instructions in 12.5.2. Copies of the report will be left with the APTF com-
mander and forwarded to Curriculum and Training Standards Program coordinator. APTF commanders
will then have 30 days to file a report to their MAJCOM Coordinator outlining corrective actions.
