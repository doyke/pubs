SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Updated format and references.
1. Program Overview.
     1.1. The purpose of this instruction is to ensure proper use of any photographic and sound
     recording, whether analog or digital, within the 59th Medical Wing. It places the burden of
     proof and responsibility on the recorder/photographer(s) that such images are obtained in
     accordance with ethical standards of medical practice and documentation for patient care,
     teaching or for potential use for scientific publications. Providers are encouraged to upload
     recordings into Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) or any
     Department of Defense (DoD) electronic medical record to document patient care.
     1.2. Recordings created or used for any purpose other than patient identification, diagnosis,
     monitoring, or treatment (or oversight of such healthcare activities) require informed consent
     by the patient or patient's legally authorized representative (for the rest of this instruction,
     references to consent of a patient refers to informed consent by the patient or the patient's
     legally authorized representative). This includes recordings that will be used for all medical
     education (other than education of trainees participating in patient's healthcare), medical
     presentations, publications, and medical boards/examinations, whether within the
     "Institution" (59th Medical Wing, Wilford Hall Medical Center) or externally. Recordings
     used for Consent must be documented in writing, using WHMC Form 366, Patient Release
     or Parent/Guardian Release for Minor Child. If a recording is made for healthcare purposes
     and later someone wants to use it for another purpose, the requestor must obtain patient's
     consent and release prior to such use.
     1.3. Consent for recordings of patients to be used for Public Affairs purposes will be
     coordinated through the 59th Medical Wing Public Affairs (59 MDW/PA) office.
     Recordings of the staff and facility and video recordings of trauma resuscitations are not
     covered by this instruction.
     1.4. Though not required, if a provider wishes to document consent for creation of
     recordings that will be used only for patient identification, diagnosis, monitoring, or
     treatment (healthcare), he or she may do so by completing a standard consent and disclosure
     form, AETC Form 1202, Disclosure and Consent, Medical and Surgical Procedures.
2. Procedures.
     2.1. Consent.
        2.1.1. When consent is required under paragraph 1.1 above, consent should be obtained
        from patient (or legally authorized representative) prior to creating the recording. If
        patient is unable to give consent prior to creating the recording (examples include
        findings discovered in the operating room, emergencies and patients who lack capacity
        and there is no available legally authorized representative but a recording must be made),
        consult the Bioethics Committee if time permits, or, if necessary, obtain consent as soon
        as possible after recording is made. If recording for which consent is required is created
        and consent is not then obtained, recording must be destroyed/deleted, unless recording
        must be preserved as evidence for legal or law enforcement purposes or for other required
        purposes. If a patient has capacity to consent, consent must be obtained from the patient,
59MDWI44-169 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                  3


     not the patient's legally authorized representative. If a recording must be destroyed,
     destruction measures must comply with AFSSI 8580, Remanence Security, and AFI 41-
     217, Health Information Assurance for Military Treatment Facilities.
     2.1.2. The patient must be informed of the purpose and intent for which recording will be
     used, the body part to be recorded, the method of recording, and the possible negative
     healthcare consequences, if any, if patient does not consent. Patient must also be
     informed that consent may be withdrawn at any time, but that once a recording is part of
     his or her medical record for healthcare purposes, it will not be removed.
     2.1.3. If consent is required in accordance with paragraphs 1.1 or 1.2 above, document it
     using WHMC Form 366 and ensure it is entered in the patient's medical record.
     2.1.4. Patient has the right to refuse to be photographed or recorded and such request will
     be honored by 59 MDW staff. The medical consequences, if any, of such refusal must be
     explained to patient and the refusal documented in the medical record. Refusal will not
     affect the patient's eligibility for care.
  2.2. Research.
     2.2.1. For recordings created as part of research, approval of the Wilford Hall Medical
     Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) must be obtained prior to beginning research, in
     accordance with IRB rules. Nothing in this instruction shall be deemed to relieve the
     researcher of obligations imposed by the IRB.
     2.2.2. The IRB or IRB Chair determines whether a HIPAA release authorization or
     waiver of authorization is required. The informed consent document approved by the
     IRB may be used in lieu of WHMC Form 366 if it contains the information identified in
     paragraph 2.1.2 above.
  2.3. Medical Photography.
     2.3.1. If desired, providers creating recordings may use a medical photographer from the
     Medical Multimedia Center, 59 MDW/PA. Call 292-7703 or 292-7688 to determine if a
     medical photographer is available. An AF Form 833, Multimedia Work Order must be
     submitted for each request. The requesting provider, not the medical photographer, is
     responsible for obtaining any required informed consent from the patient for creating the
     recording. WHMC Form 366 must be used to document this consent, regardless of the
     purpose of the recording, and a copy must be provided to the medical photographer
     before he or she may begin creating recordings.
     2.3.2. Multimedia personnel involved in creation and distribution of a recording must
     comply with all privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations, including HIPAA.
  2.4. Minors.
     2.4.1. Informed consent for recordings of minor patients must be documented. For
     minor patients, consent for creation and authorization for release of recording must be
     obtained from one of patient's parents. If a parent is unavailable, consent must be
     obtained from the minor patient's legal guardian or legally authorized representative.
     Contact the medical law consultant office (292-7808) with any questions regarding
     consent for minors.

        2.4.2. If a minor patient is undergoing evaluation or treatment to which he or she is
        legally permitted to consent without parental consent, the minor may consent to the
        creation of recordings for purposes of medical care only without parental consent.
        However, only the minor patient's parent or legally authorized representative may give
        the consent required by paragraphs 1.1 or 1.2 above.
        2.4.3. A minor patient's assent to the creation of images for which a parent or legally
        authorized representative has consented should be noted in the medical record.
3. Privacy and Confidentiality.
     3.1. When recording is patient-identifiable (e.g., face, unique physical feature, external
     markings, voice, etc.) or the recording is accompanied by patient-identifiable information, it
     constitutes protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA.
        3.1.1. A recording constituting PHI must be created, transmitted, and stored in
        accordance with all applicable privacy laws, including HIPAA and The Privacy Act of
        1974, and Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force systems security regulations
        (Communications and Information Instructions).
        3.1.2. A recording constituting or containing PHI may not be transmitted through a non-
        DoD network or sent electronically through non-DoD servers. Emails containing PHI/PII
        (Personally Identifying Information) should be digitally signed and encrypted IAW AFI
        33-119, Air Force Messaging.
        3.1.3. A recording constituting or containing PHI will not be removed from 59 MDW
        facilities on a non-government owned storage device (including memory card, flash or
        hard drive, CD-ROM, or recording device with internal memory such as phones and
        some cameras). Additionally, the use of personal cell phones to create or transmit
        recordings is prohibited.
     3.2. When creating a recording of patient with the intent that the patient will not be
     identifiable, the patient's jewelry or other personal items unique to the patient should be
     removed, masked, or placed so as not to appear in the recording.
     3.3. Before any recording containing PHI may be released outside of the 59th Medical Wing
     a WHMC Form 366 or HIPAA Release Authorization, DD Form 2870, Authorization for
     Disclosure of Medical or Dental Information must be obtained from patient and filed with
     the Release of Healthcare Information office.
     3.4. Anyone not already bound by the hospital’s confidentiality policy must sign a
     confidentiality statement before creating recordings of patients.
