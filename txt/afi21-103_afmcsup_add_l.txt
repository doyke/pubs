This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance, AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management, and AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and
Utilization Reporting. It establishes policy and assigns responsibility to provide AFMC Test
Fleet aircraft status changes/updates in accordance with (IAW) current maintenance conditions
and the developed MDS specific mission essential subsystem list (MESL). This instruction
applies to all AFMC organizations that manage or perform maintenance on AFMC
owned/possessed aircraft regardless of Air Force Specialty Code. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Send comments and
suggested improvements to this instruction on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication, to HQ AFMC/A4MM, 462 Chidlaw Road, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5006.

These MESLs complement AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
They apply to maintenance activities supporting AFMC test missions across AFMC.

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of assigned/possessed AFMC test fleet aircraft and equipment
  2                             AFI21-103_AFMCSUP_ADDENDUM_L 19 OCTOBER 2011


 supporting AFMC test missions. They list the minimum essential systems and subsystems that
 must work on test fleet aircraft to perform specifically assigned unit test, training or other
 missions.
 1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define system exceptions and help explain complex degraded
 mission systems.
 1.2. It is understood that any aircraft or support equipment system or subsystem may be
 subjected to test or tested under a test scenario and/or are test dependent as directed by the test
 mission director. If identified by test mission director, those systems or subsystems if not
 already identified by qualifying notes must be operational to be considered FMC or PMC for that
 mission.
 2. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by WUC or UNS
 column (column 2) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List
 (BSLs) across the page (DTE - Developmental Test and Evaluation, DTS - Developmental Test
 Support, TNG - Training). Each unit’s Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement
 determines applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft or equipment MESLs incorporate all
 AFMC assigned/possessed aircraft/equipment and therefore it is important to compare only the
 columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the units assigned/possessed aircraft. For
 example, units with training (TF) coded aircraft would determine report status using only the
 FSL and TNG columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported using
 the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft/equipment assignment code or type
 mission being flown.

 QUALIFYING NOTES:
 1. One igniter per engine must be operable.
 2. One may be inoperative provided all other indicators for affected engine are operating
 normally.
 3. (1) Refer to Aircraft Flight Manual, Section 1. (2) Simulated 3-engine approaches and touch
 and go landings are not authorized with PMC inoperative.
 4. Ensure engine start capability exists at recovery site.
 5. Left auxiliary pump must be operative.

6. The trim switch must operate for the pilot flying during critical phases of flight.
7. One may be inoperative on either flap gauge provided: (1) Flaps operate normally, (2)
Verification of flap position can be made prior to take off and landing.
8. Must operate for long range cruise above FL 250.
9. (1) Automatic or manual mode must be operable. (2) Exception: Not required for
unpressurized flight, see AFI 11-202, Volume 3 for requirements.
10. Automatic or manual mode must be operable.
11. (1) One may be inoperative on takeoff, but "R" model must have repair capability at next
destination. (2) One may inoperative, but on "E" model the failure must fail to the closed
position. Consider pressurization and temperature for sustained high altitude cruise.
12. One may be inoperative, but must fail to open position. Pull circuit breaker.
13. Valves not required to be operative if fuel is not needed for flight, and valves are verified
closed.
14. (1) All must operate for extended over-water operations. (2) All must operate for gross
weights which do not permit an immediate landing under normal flight manual landing
parameters.
15. Only required if carrying passengers/troops.
16. Navigator's altimeter may be inoperative with no associated pitot static problems.
Navigator’s altimeter must be operable prior to operation in RVSM airspace on 55-3132 and 63-
8050.
17. Primary system must be operable, minimum pressure 325 p.s.i.
18. One per primary crew member.
19. Each primary crewmember must have access to an operable regulator during flight.
20. Required for Air Refueling Missions.
21. (1) All must be operative except to avoid delays from airfields where maintenance is not
adequate. (2) One time takeoff and flight is permitted with a disconnected generator drive to
reach a field where repairs can be made. (3) With an inoperative generator (a) Do not use
mission power without first coordinating electrical loads with the mission and flight crew. (b)
Total flight and mission electrical loads shall not be allowed to exceed 50% of rated output for
the number of generators operating. (c) All remaining generators must be paralleled and supply
power to all generator buses.
22. As mission dictates. Comm 1 must operate.
23. Both wing tip lights and one tail light must be operative.
24. At least one must operate.
25. One taxi or terrain light must be operative for night operations.
26. Crew entry door and cargo door must be visually verified secured.

27. Sufficient at pilot or copilot position to monitor aircraft position, performance, and maintain
aircraft control.
28. Initial position and date/time must be manually inserted into EGI.
29. Required if equipped.
30. N/A “Pacer Crag”
31. Required for thunderstorms or hazardous weather in the area of flight.
32. May be inoperative with no pitot static system problems.
33. Both DADC’s, all altimeters, autopilot altitude hold alerter and IFF/SIF, all must be
operational for dispatch into RVSM airspace.
34. Inoperative Thrust Reversers must be locked-out. In addition, Symmetrical Engine Thrust
Reverser must also be locked-out to maintain symmetrical thrust. i.e. Engine #1 and #4 or Engine
#2 and #3 must be locked-out together.
35. Test Mission Dependent.
36. Does not apply to acft 61-00320—upper deck tank is deactivated due to water spray
configuration.
