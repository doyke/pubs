                                            Chapter 1

      INTRODUCTION TO AIR MOBILITY COMMAND FORCE PRESENTATION

1.1. General. This document clarifies the roles, responsibilities, relationships, and authorities of
the Component-Major Command (C-MAJCOM), Component-Numbered Air Force (C-NAF),
and associated entities as they apply to AMC. Since AMC is not resourced to build complete,
independent C-MAJCOM and C-NAF staffs, AMC’s senior leadership will ensure effective
command and control (C2) by optimizing the use of collaborative tools and assuming risks as
deemed appropriate. This allows AMC staff to continue providing common staff support to
multiple commanders.
1.2. Purpose and Desired End State.
     1.2.1. Purpose. To provide an understanding of the roles, responsibilities, relationships, and
     authorities of the C-MAJCOM, C-NAF, and associated entities as they apply to AMC. To
     enhance the performance of AMC in support of its combatant command, United States
     Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), as well as in the execution of its
     responsibilities to organize, train, and equip (OT&E) mobility forces in support of the
     Secretary of the Air Force’s (SECAF) Title 10 responsibilities.
     1.2.2. This directive is an authoritative description of how the AMC/CC implements United
     States Air Force Program Action Directives (USAF PAD), doctrine, C2 concepts and other
     references listed in Attachment 1. Doctrine and policy allow latitude or often do not
     adequately prescribe AMC command and staff organization; therefore, this document
     establishes, codifies, and integrates those concepts.
     1.2.3. Desired End State. An AMC organization that performs its mission effectively and
     efficiently, continuously improves its support of the commander’s ability to monitor, assess,
     plan, and execute the rapid global mobility (RGM) mission, and builds a stronger Mobility
     Air Force (MAF) for tomorrow.
1.3. Background. An AMC Vice Commander (AMC/CV)-chartered MAF C2 Campaign Plan
researched the future strategic environment and found the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff
(CJCS) Joint Operational Access Concept appropriately framed the future operational
environment that highlights required MAF C2 capabilities. The campaign plan applied the
standard joint capabilities based assessment (CBA) construct to identify over 20 gaps/shortfalls
in C2 capabilities and, in conjunction, developed associated solutions that provide a path towards
closing these gaps/shortfalls. Among the solutions was one preeminent task that serves as a basis
for most others: "AMC needs to define the organizational roles, responsibilities, relationships,
and associated authorities (R3A) of the Component Major Command (C-MAJCOM) and the
Component Numbered Air Force (C-NAF) and the tasks and functions of the shared (matrixed)
staff."

                                          Chapter 2

              FORCE PRESENTATION ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. General. The President and/or Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) exercise authority over
missions and forces assigned to combatant commands through the combatant commander
(CCDR) with the advice and assistance of the Chairman of the CJCS. For purposes other than
operational direction of forces assigned to the combatant commands, the President and/or
Secretary of Defense exercise authority and control through the service secretaries and service
chiefs of staff.
2.2. Commander, United States Transportation Command (CDRUSTRANSCOM). Title
10 United States Code, Section 164 assigns all active and reserve air mobility forces of the
armed forces stationed in the United States to USTRANSCOM. For a list of all forces currently
designated as mobility operations forces, see the SECDEF Global Force Management
Implementation Guidance (GFMIG), Section II ―Assignment of Forces (Forces For Unified
Commands). The Unified Command Plan (UCP) specifies that CDRUSTRANSCOM is the
mobility Joint Force Provider, responsible for providing combat-ready mobility.
2.3. Chief Of Staff Of The Air Force (CSAF) Intent.
   2.3.1. The CSAF current standing directive states an Air Force component headquarters
   must support their respective unified combatant commander (CCDR) with air, space, and
   cyberspace capabilities to achieve strategic, operational, and tactical objectives across the
   range of military operations. AF component headquarters will provide the command,
   control, and support of those forces and operations. In achieving these capabilities AF
   component headquarters should “size to the minimum level necessary” to establish a core
   capability for:
       2.3.1.1. Steady State—plan, exercise, assess and execute across normalized steady-state
       operations tempo.
       2.3.1.2. Wartime/Crisis Surge—surge to the most likely wartime scenario until
       augmentation is available.
       2.3.1.3. Accomplish service functions that cannot be completed through reach back.
   2.3.2. CSAF’s intent is that Lead-Major Commands (L-MAJCOMs) build a stronger Air
   Force for tomorrow that provides and supports Air Force forces, ready and able to deploy
   quickly and employ globally to accomplish the CCDR’s strategic, operational, and tactical
   objectives.
2.4. AMC Implementation Of CSAF Intent.
   2.4.1. The basic USAF organizational construct in the presentation of forces to combatant
   commands across the full range of military operations is through the Air Force “component”
   construct.
       2.4.1.1. SECAF designated AMC as the Air Force L-MAJCOM for Mobility Air Forces.
       2.4.1.2. For USTRANSCOM, the CSAF designated AMC as its C-MAJCOM with
       Eighteenth Air Force (18 AF) as its C-NAF.

2.5. Commander, Air Mobility Command (AMC/CC).
     2.5.1. Air Mobility Command is both a MAJCOM and the Service air component to
     USTRANSCOM. The AMC/CC is charged with providing trained and ready air mobility
     forces to the CCDRs. When directed by CDRUSTRANSCOM, AMC/CC deploys active
     component AMC forces, recommends mobilization, and deploys reserve component forces.
     AMC/CC is responsible to CDRUSTRANSCOM for executing operational authorities.
     AMC/CC is also responsible for executing CSAF’s organize, train, and equip ADCON
     authorities.
2.6. Roles, Responsibilities, Relationships, Authorities, And Functions.
     2.6.1. Lead MAJCOM Responsibilities. A L-MAJCOM is a major service subdivision of
     the Department of the Air Force, directly subordinate to Headquarters US Air Force
     supporting the SECAF as a management headquarters. AMC is the L-MAJCOM for the
     MAF. The intent of designating AMC as a L-MAJCOM is to consolidate applicable OT&E
     responsibilities for the MAF with the staff and commander best suited to sustain and improve
     the RGM USAF core function. As an Air Force L-MAJCOM under the direction of the
     SECAF and CSAF, the AMC/CC is responsible for the following:
        2.6.1.1. AMC/CC has a Service OT&E role as a MAJCOM and L-MAJCOM.
        2.6.1.2. AMC/CC performs Service roles through the MAJCOM staff.
        2.6.1.3. AMC/CC exercises administrative control (ADCON) of AMC units via 18 AF
        Commander (18 AF/CC) and the USAF EC/CC.
     2.6.2. Air Component Responsibilities.
        2.6.2.1. The CSAF designated AMC as USTRANSCOM’s C-MAJCOM.
        2.6.2.2. CDRUSTRANSCOM exercises combatant command authority (COCOM) over
        all AMC forces. Operational control (OPCON) of these forces has been delegated to the
        commander of AMC, USTRANSCOM's Air Force component commander.
        2.6.2.3. As the air component command to USTRANSCOM, AMC is designated Air
        Forces Transportation (AFTRANS). Accordingly, AMC/CC is AFTRANS/CC who in
        turn delegates operational control and appropriate authorities to 18 AF/CC to execute the
        AFTRANS mission. The nomenclature 18 AF (AFTRANS) is used to designate 18 AF as
        the subordinate C-NAF to the C-MAJCOM.
            2.6.2.3.1. AFTRANS is comprised of AMC, 18 AF, 618 AOC (TACC), SECDEF-
            assigned forces, and AMC-gained Air Reserve Component Forces.
        2.6.2.4. AMC/CC is the commander of Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) to
        USTRANSCOM.
            2.6.2.4.1. AMC/CC delegates 18 AF/CC operational authorities in a standing order
            but retains responsibility for all COMAFFOR actions. As the responsible commander,
            the AMC/CC may rescind or amend delegated authorities at any time by notifying the
            subordinate commander.
                2.6.2.4.1.1. The COMAFFOR executes administrative duties through the AMC
                staff and operational duties through the 18 AF/CC (AFTRANS).
AMCI10-202V1 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                   7


  2.6.3. C-NAF Within AMC:
     2.6.3.1. 18 AF is the AF C-NAF within AMC which executes CDRUSTRANSCOM-
     assigned missions.
     2.6.3.2. The AMC C-NAF includes the 18 AF/CC, the 18 AF organic staff, the 618 AOC
     (TACC), and all assigned forces.
     2.6.3.3. 18 AF, with its organic staff and AOC, supports the AMC/CC through the full
     range of air mobility operations at the operational and tactical levels in world-wide
     operations.
     2.6.3.4. The 18 AF staff, together with the shared AMC staff and AOC, provides the 18
     AF/CC the ability to monitor, assess, plan and execute world-wide mobility missions as
     the air component execution arm to USTRANSCOM.
     2.6.3.5. The COMAFFOR delegates OPCON to 18 AF/CC to assess operational risk and
     execute operational level of war decisions.
         2.6.3.5.1. When the COMAFFOR delegates operational command and authorities to
         the 18 AF/CC, 18 AF/CC assumes the title 18 AF (AFTRANS).
     2.6.3.6. 18 AF (AFTRANS)/CC delegates tactical control (TACON) to 618 AOC
     (TACC)/CC of the AMC gained and assigned forces made available for allocation and
     execution. Specific authorities are detailed in the annual 18 AF standing execution order
     (EXORD).
     2.6.3.7. The 18 AF (AFTRANS) portion of the AFFOR staff required for routine
     operations is defined as organically assigned A3 and A5 plus Air Force Forces-
     Integration (AFFOR-I), A2 and Special Staff. Full AFFOR staff functions may require
     support from the shared staff in HQ AMC.
  2.6.4. Functions of the 18 AF Staff:
     2.6.4.1. 18 AF staff employs the Joint Operation Planning Process (JOPP) to develop
     supporting plans to accomplish missions assigned by CDRUSTRANSCOM. In
     deliberate planning, the 18 AF/A5 provides Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data
     (TPFDD) feasibility and mission analysis of operational plans (OPLAN)/concept plans
     (CONPLANS), conducts assessments of current operations with support from 618 AOC
     (TACC), and leads compartmental planning efforts including J-Alerts and 8010 classified
     plans. The 18 AF/A3 continuously monitors and analyzes global mobility operations in
     order to facilitate resolution of issues, refine operations, or prepare the enterprise for
     near-term future operations. During crisis action planning or execution, the 18 AF/A3
     may formally convene an operational planning team (OPT) comprised of functional
     representatives from the 18 AF and AMC staffs and 618 AOC (TACC) to enable the 18
     AF/CC to execute AMC commander responsibilities. OPT formation is not required to
     coordinate through 18 AF Chief of Staff (18 AF/CS) to AMC Director of Staff
     (AMC/DS) channels.
     2.6.4.2. The 18 AF staff continuously executes the following six steps and leads daily
     planning activities to set the conditions for the air mobility system to perform routine,
     contingency or crisis mobility missions. 18 AF will:
8                                                             AMCI10-202V1 5 AUGUST 2014


           2.6.4.2.1. CONDUCT MISSION ANALYSIS. Planners will fully analyze the
           situation and define the problems, and facilitate OPT actions to initiate the JOPP.
           2.6.4.2.2. BUILD EN ROUTE SUPPORT. Based on mission analysis, 18 AF
           planners identify the Global Air Mobility Support System (GAMSS) adjustments
           necessary to support the mission.
           2.6.4.2.3. CONDUCT GLOBAL CAPACITY ANALYSIS. 18 AF/A3 analyzes
           aircrews, aircraft, airfields, and enabler forces to determine where to source additional
           forces as required to achieve the mission. AMC functional area managers address
           surge requests, depot, request for forces (RFFs), etc.
           2.6.4.2.4. ESTABLISH C2 RELATIONSHIPS. In conjunction with other planning
           efforts, 18 AF directs Directors of Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFORs) and mobility
           liaisons to key locations/organizations, and where and when needed, deploys air
           mobility operations squadrons to augment air mobility divisions (AMDs).
           2.6.4.2.5. PROVIDE END-TO-END ANALYSIS. 18 AF (AFTRANS) facilitates/
           integrates all planning efforts from mission analysis, 618 AOC (TACC) operational
           assessment and expertise, enabling/port support, aircraft/crew availability, and C2
           capability to form cohesive, executable concepts and plans.
           2.6.4.2.6. PROVIDE SYNCHRONIZATION. 18 AF facilitates secure communication
           (for example, Defense Connect Online (DCOs))/situation reports (SITREPs) with all C2
           nodes to collaborate on plans, guidance, performance, and key information.
    2.6.5. Task Force-294 (TF-294).
       2.6.5.1. An additional role of the 18 AF Commander is to command United States
       Strategic Command's (USSTRATCOM) TF-294. Commander, TF-294 (CTF-294)
       provides support to USSTRATCOM’s mission for strategic deterrence and global strike.
       Eighteenth AF/CC is in a dual-hatted role supporting both USSTRATCOM and
       USTRANSCOM. This allows for best possible synchronization of the entire enterprise in
       support of all combatant commanders requirements.
       2.6.5.2. The mission of TF-294 is to coordinate force positioning, generation,
       connectivity, and force sustainment; manage the attached air refueling, and mobile
       support team (MST) forces; and to report and advocate on matters affecting readiness in
       order to support nuclear global strike missions.
       2.6.5.3. SECDEF apportions KC-135s and C-130s to USSTRATCOM for planning
       purposes. When directed by SECDEF-approved CJCS Deployment Order (DEPORD) or
       EXORD, TF-294 consists of those KC-135s and associated nuclear global strike-certified
       crews, flying crew chiefs, and deployable maintenance support teams (MST).
       Commander USSTRATCOM delegates TACON of these attached forces to CTF-294.
       2.6.5.4. CTF-294 exercises direct liaison authorized (DIRLAUTH) with 18 AF,
       USTRANSCOM/J3 and AMC/A3N to meet crisis support requirements.
       2.6.5.5. CTF-294 activates the TF-294 Battle Staff (TFBS) during periods of heightened
       tensions. When activated, AMC/A3N forms the core of the TFBS. The TFBS is a
       trained and functionally qualified crisis action element established to monitor, assess,
       synchronize, and report CTF-294 directions, equities, and attached force status and
AMCI10-202V1 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                9


      activities. TFBS exercises DIRLAUTH with the 18 AF (AFTRANS) Battle Staff to meet
      mission requirements. The 18 AF (AFTRANS) Battle Staff serves as the primary conduit
      for TF-294 force support and information requirements.
   2.6.6. 618 AOC (TACC). 618 AOC (TACC) plans, tasks, executes, and assesses all
   USTRANSCOM air mobility and air mobility support mission requirements. Fusion center
   representatives consult with USTRANSCOM to refine and assess the feasibility of
   Combatant Commander (CCDR) requirements. When existing node capacity does not meet
   mission requirements, 618 AOC (TACC) informs 18 AF (AFTRANS) who coordinates
   changes to the GAMSS with the USAF EC and/or AMC/A4. When mode capacity does not
   meet requirements, 618 AOC (TACC) informs 18 AF (AFTRANS) who coordinates changes
   to the COMAFFOR apportionment and allocation process (CAAP) with AMC/A3. 18
   AF/CC further delineates 618 AOC (TACC) authorities in an annual standing Operations
   Order (OPORD).
   2.6.7. USAF EC. The USAF EC is tasked with separate and distinct roles.
      2.6.7.1. The USAF EC/CC has the responsibility to conduct the ongoing training mission
      of the USAF EC through the Mobility Operations School (MOS) and Expeditionary
      Operations School (EOS), both located at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. In order to
      perform this mission, the USAF EC/CC exercises ADCON of these forces.
      2.6.7.2. The USAF EC/CC also exercises ADCON of the 87th, 319th, and 628th Air
      Base Wings (ABW), 621st Contingency Response Wing (CRW), 515th and 521st Air
      Mobility Operations Wings (AMOW), 627th Air Base Group (ABG), and 43d Airlift
      Group (AG). The 18 AF (AFTRANS)/CC exercises OPCON of these same forces when
      accomplishing USTRANSCOM missions. The separation of ADCON and OPCON
      between the USAF EC/CC and 18 AF/CC of these ABWs, CRW, AMOWs, ABG, and
      AG does not alter the SECDEF 2012-2013 GFMIG alignment of these forces to
      USTRANSCOM. Some ADCON authorities may be accomplished directly by the AMC
      staff in a skip echelon relationship status (see Chapter 4).
      2.6.7.3. The USAF EC/CC also provides Joint Base (JB) command oversight as the
      Intermediate Command Summit (ICS) Chair for AMC-led Joint Bases McGuire-Dix-
      Lakehurst and Charleston. Further, USAF/EC is the Senior AF commander providing
      command oversight on the Army-chaired JB Lewis-McChord ICS.

                                           Chapter 3

                                       AFFOR STAFF

3.1. AF Doctrine Volume. The AFFOR staff’s function is to support and assist the
COMAFFOR in preparing the Air Force component to carry out the functions and tasks assigned
by the joint force commander (JFC).
   3.1.1. AMC’s AFFOR staff construct is based on the constraint that AMC shares common
   staff resources and is not comprised of complete, independent C-MAJCOM and C-NAF
   staffs. The C-NAF conducts AFFOR functions by using a tailored, hybrid, highly-leveraged
   construct dependent on support from the AMC headquarters management staff.
3.2. Requesting AFFOR Functions/Services not Resident Within 18 AF.
   3.2.1. AMC performs AFFOR activities and tasks through a tailored 18 AF (AFTRANS)
   AFFOR staff that consists of organically assigned A3 and A5 personnel, as well as by
   resources assigned to the AMC MAJCOM staff, the 618 AOC (TACC), and in some cases,
   the wings.
   3.2.2. When 18 AF receives a new, non-recurring, or emerging requirement, Eighteenth Air
   Force Chief of Staff (18 AF/CS) requests AMC staff support for AFFOR functions/services
   through the AMC Director of Staff (AMC/DS). When more responsive access to AFFOR
   functions/services in the AMC staff is required (e.g., in a time of crisis), 18 AF Battle Staff
   will coordinate support requests with the AMC Crisis Action Team (CAT).
   3.2.3. AMC/CV and 18 AF/CC-coordinated routine, recurring processes should run as
   established. For example: 18 AF will continue to reach to AMC/A3O for sourcing solutions,
   or A3V for waiver expertise, or AMC/A2 for the Threat Working Group (TWG)
   assessments, or AMC/A3D for the Cyber Defense Working Group (CDWG) analysis, and the
   618 AOC (TACC)/XOOI as the IOT and CO deliberate and crisis action planning as required
   in support of 618 AOC (TACC) and MAF operations, without formal coordination through
   18 AF CS/AMC DS.
   3.2.4. Those AMC MAJCOM and 618 AOC (TACC) staff who respond to 18 AF
   requirements are accomplishing AFFOR functions/services.
   3.2.5. 18 AF (AFTRANS) staff may also reach beyond the traditional staff for
   assistance/support normally accomplished at the AFFOR level. For example: The
   preponderance of contingency response (CR) expertise resides in the 621 CRW. 18 AF
   (AFTRANS) may task down into the wing for assistance in reviewing airfield surveys and
   assistance in planning the laydown of CR forces.
3.3. AFFOR Staff Responsibilities and Work Flow.
   3.3.1. In the event the wings or 618 AOC (TACC) are unable to assist in crisis operations, 18
   AF/CC may request augmentation from the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve
   Command.
   3.3.2. The AMC Commander forms the AFFOR staff to execute operational responsibilities,
   sets the priority, and conveys it to the 18 AF/CC. Individuals on the AMC MAJCOM staff
AMCI10-202V1 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                13


  may support both the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC. As an example: An individual on the AMC
  MAJCOM staff may analyze policy (OT&E) issues on a given day, while on the subsequent
  day, review operational/execution issues in direct support of 18 AF/CC.
  3.3.3. To more clearly identify AFFOR staff work flow, AMC has further decomposed and
  identified responsibilities of the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC within functional staff areas A1
  through A9 and special staff, such as Judge Advocate, Surgeon General, and Combat
  Capabilities. Please refer to the link at Attachment 2, for complete Tasks and Functions of
  the AMC Shared Staff.

                                            Chapter 4

                                        SKIP ECHELON

4.1. Due to the small USAF EC and 18 AF staff size, AMC staff exercises a skip echelon
relationship with their subordinate units. Skip echelon is a concept under which one level of
command may be skipped for prescribed tasks that the headquarters is not responsible for, nor
manned to support. For example: A wing may skip 18 AF and coordinate directly with
AMC/A1when looking for Human Relations Workforce Diversity/Equal Opportunity support.
   4.1.1. Roles, responsibilities, relationships, and authorities of the skip echelon.
       4.1.1.1. The COMAFFOR will not sanction command authority that skips echelon.
       4.1.1.2. The AMC staff will include 18 AF and/or USAF EC in staffing products that
       affect command operational readiness of assigned units.
       4.1.1.3. When the AMC MAJCOM staff skips 18 AF or USAF EC echelon, the AMC
       MAJCOM staff will execute effective concurrent and/or follow-up communication to the
       respective 18 AF or USAF EC commanders’ support staff.
       4.1.1.4. AMC MAJCOM staff will provide 18 AF and USAF EC staffs access to
       appropriate information/data systems to exercise command and maintain an advocacy
       role in all functions required to manage their units.
   4.1.2. Examples of AMC skip echelon staff functions are found via reference to routine
   ADCON functions:
       4.1.2.1. AMC wings and units report to either 18 AF/CC or USAF EC/CC, who both
       report to AMC/CC.
       4.1.2.2. AMC/CC exercises L-MAJCOM responsibilities through the AMC staff.
          4.1.2.2.1. OT&E responsibilities vary depending upon the particular command
          echelon. In general, OT&E focus is broader and more strategic at the MAJCOM
          level and becomes more tactical at subsequent subordinate levels.
       4.1.2.3. AMC/CC did not resource 18 AF/CC and USAF EC/CC to perform OT&E staff
       functions, thus all capacity to accomplish OT&E resides in the AMC MAJCOM staff.
          4.1.2.3.1. The AMC MAJCOM staff works directly with the wings on OT&E issues
          and should keep the intermediate commander informed on issues/actions that rise to
          the wing commander level for potential advocacy and/or situational awareness.
       4.1.2.4. The 18 AF/CC and USAF EC/CC can also engage the AMC MAJCOM staff
       directly, through the appropriate established processes, to help solve/influence OT&E
       issues that warrant their operational concerns/attention.
       4.1.2.5. AMC/CC retains Functional Area Managers (FAMs) at the MAJCOM level.
       FAMs work directly with subordinate commanders on behalf of AMC/CC to source/task
       Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) forces, and provide OT&E expertise for command
       ADCON responsibilities. (Note: FAMs also assist 18 AF/CC in accomplishing OPCON
       of USTRANSCOM missions by sourcing/tasking forces and providing functional
       expertise to OPTs.)

                                          Chapter 5

                     COMMAND AND CONTROL OF AMC FORCES

5.1. Command and Control (C2). Exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned forces in the accomplishment of the mission. C2 functions are
performed through the management of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities and
procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing and controlling forces and
operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
5.2. Command. Command is the authority that a military commander lawfully exercises over
subordinates by virtue of rank or assignment. This includes the authority and responsibility for
effectively using available resources and for planning the employment of, organizing, directing,
coordinating and controlling military forces for the accomplishment of assigned missions. Also,
includes responsibility for health, welfare, morale and discipline of assigned personnel.
5.3. Control. Control is the authority exercised by a commander over part of the activities of
subordinates or other organizations. Control may be less than full command.
5.4. Basic C2 Principles. AMC forces operate throughout the spectrum of warfare,
contingencies, and humanitarian relief/disaster response (HA/DR) operations. They provide the
global capability to deploy, employ, redeploy, reinforce and reposition forces. C2 efforts must
focus on mobility, responsiveness, and flexibility in conducting peacetime day-to-day operations
or when responding to contingencies. AMC C2 is based on a permanent structure within the
Continental United States (CONUS), as well as permanent or temporary en route structures
provided by GAMSS forces. The AMC C2 system is subdivided into three distinct components:
CONUS, en route, and deployable.
5.5. CONUS Key Components of AMC Command and Control.
   5.5.1. Commander, Air Force Forces. (COMAFFOR). The COMAFFOR is the single
   commander who is responsible for operating and supporting all US Air Force forces assigned
   or attached to a joint force. Thus, the COMAFFOR commands forces through two separate
   chains of responsibilities, the operational and the administrative. The AMC Commander is
   the COMAFFOR to USTRANSCOM.
   5.5.2. AMC CAT. Crisis, contingency, exercise, and wartime operations require continuous
   HQ AMC attention and timely response to both internal and external taskings, including
   tasks from USTRANSCOM, HQ USAF, 18 AF (AFTRANS), and 618 AOC (TACC). The
   CAT provides the AMC Commander with a corporate approach to time-sensitive operations
   and a flexible support staff tailored to meet worldwide air mobility requirements during times
   of crisis. The AMC CAT provides a graduated crisis response capability and the ability for
   the AMC staff to quickly respond to contingency taskings. The AMC Vice Commander
   (AMC/CV) convenes the CAT to direct a concentrated effort by the AMC staff to support
   crisis action planning and plan execution.
   5.5.3. 18 AF Battle Staff. Upon activation during a crisis, contingency, or exercise, the
   Battle Staff fulfills a key role as the 24/7 team of cross-functional experts to assist the 18
   AF/CC (AFTRANS) in conducting Operational Level of War tasks. The Battle Staff directly
   interfaces with appropriate CCDRs, MAJCOMs, NAFs, 618 AOC/TACC, liaisons and
AMCI10-202V1 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                        17


   outside agencies to provide integrated situational awareness for the enterprise. Using the
   Joint Operational Planning Process, the team conducts mission analysis and facilitates
   development of courses of action for the 18 AF/CC (AFTRANS). The team disseminates 18
   AF/CC (AFTRANS) approved staff estimates, mission statements, commander's intent,
   command relations and other pertinent operational information necessary to execute the air
   mobility contingency mission.
   5.5.4. 618 AOC (TACC). The 618 AOC (TACC) is a functional AOC. A functional AOC
   is part of the command structure in a functional Combatant Command. It is the mission
   planning and execution arm of 18 AF. 618 AOC (TACC) directly supports USTRANSCOM
   by providing air component expertise in the USTC/J3 Fusion Center. 18 AF/CC delegates
   TACON to 618 AOC (TACC)/CC in a standing order.
      5.5.4.1. Contingency Response Cell (CRC). The CRC is the 618 AOC (TACC)’s focal
      point for all large-scale or high interest air mobility operations and will be activated at the
      discretion of the 618 AOC (TACC) commander. The primary purpose of the CRC is to
      plan/execute rapidly emerging requirements for operations that exceed the capabilities or
      do not fit into 618 AOC (TACC)’s normal planning/execution processes. When the
      operation can be supported effectively using normal 618 AOC (TACC) processes, the
      CRC stands down.
5.6. Fixed En Route Structure.
   5.6.1. The en route structure provides a baseline C2 infrastructure for conducting air
   mobility support operations at established locations. It also provides a mission monitoring
   and flight following capability to effectively manage mobility missions. This structure
   includes AMOWs and their subordinate GAMSS global network of personnel, facilities and
   equipment based on a fixed system supporting USTRANSCOM worldwide airlift and air
   refueling operations.
5.7. Deployable En Route Structure.
   5.7.1. Deployable forces augment or expand the AMC C2 structure at locations where an
   AMC presence is either limited or non-existent. Regional contingencies, which include
   wartime or humanitarian operations, create a temporary surge that stresses the established
   day-to-day capability of AMC C2. Based on these demands, AMC expands the C2 structure
   by deploying its forces toward and within an area of responsibility. The 618 AOC (TACC)
   monitors ongoing air mobility operations to determine if and when augmentation/expansion
   is required. Typical tasked forces include Contingency Response (CR) forces (e.g.,
   Contingency Response Group (CRG), Contingency Response Elements (CREs), and
   Contingency Response Teams (CRTs)) and assets from fixed AMC/Air Reserve Component
   (ARC) wings. Additionally, if the AMC presence placed within a geographic region is
   significant, air mobility personnel are placed within the AMD, in the AOC supporting that
   region, to manage theater Air Mobility operations and to coordinate with the 618 AOC
   (TACC).

Table 5.1. Deployed Organizational Descriptions.
 Air Mobility     Located at Hickam AFB, Hawaii and Ramstein AB, Germany, AMOWs are
 Operations       charged with coordinating logistical air movements into and out of Europe and
 Wings (AMOW)     the Pacific theaters as well as providing oversight and direction for their
                  subordinate Air Mobility Operation Groups.
 Air Mobility     Four overseas organizations that plan, supervise, manage, and direct the
 Operations       activities of their subordinate Air Mobility Squadrons (AMS), detachments, and
 Groups           operating locations. AMOGs provide administrative control, en route aircraft
 (AMOGs)          maintenance support, and transportation services for inter-theater and intra-
                  theater air mobility missions worldwide. The AMOG performs command,
                  operations, logistics (aerial port, aircraft maintenance and supply),
                  communications, C2, budget, safety, plans and support agreement duties.

 Operating        worldwide on a smaller scale than a Detachment.
 Location (OL)
 Air Mobility     A provisional air mobility unit composed of deployed aircrews, associated
 Task Force       aircraft, and appropriately-sized CRF.
 Contingency      CRF provides “first responder” contingency response (CR) forces to the joint
 Response Force   force commander regardless of service. CRFs may be composed of a scalable
 (CRF)            contingency response group (CRG), contingency response element (CRE) or
                  contingency response team (CRT). CRF are trained and equipped to operate
                  self-sufficiently in the expeditionary environment.
 Contingency      The designated in-garrison and deployed composite group of forces that
 Response Group   provides the CCDR with a majority of the Open the Airbase FM. This deployed
 (CRG)            capability bridges the gap between seizure forces (when present) and
                  sustainment forces (in subsequent FMs). The CRG includes core CRF
                  capabilities of C2, aerial port and aircraft maintenance plus organic base
                  operating support and is capable of supporting a working MOG of 2 with 24
                  hour coverage. Select CRGs may also train and deploy with a US Army rapid
                  port opening element as part of the Joint Task Force–Port Opening (JTF-PO) to
                  provide capability of establishing and moving cargo up to 10 kilometers from
                  the airbase to a forward distribution node to increase the volume of cargo
                  through an APOD. A CRG is led by a rated mobility O-6. USTRANSCOM
                  retains and exercises OPCON/TACON of JTF-PO forces through their DDOC.

                            CORE FUNCTION LEADS (CFL)

6.1. Air Force CFLs.
   6.1.1. Air Force CFLs are MAJCOM/CCs who have been designated, by CSAF, as Air
   Force lead integrators for specific Service core functions. For example: AMC/CC is the
   RGM CFL because AMC is the air component to USTRANSCOM and is responsible for all
   global mobility airlift, aeromedical evacuation, and aerial refueling for the DOD. The CFLs
   produce the respective Core Function Master Plans (CFMPs) which outline the planning
   strategies and programs for RGM portfolio funding in accordance with (IAW) the Program
   Objective Memorandum (POM) Preparation Instruction (PPI) published annually by
   AF/A8PE. AMC/A5/8 is the command lead for CFLI coordination and command OPR for
   development of RGM CFMP.
   6.1.2. One task of the RGM CFL is to establish the 20-year Planning Force Proposals to
   organize, train, and equip United States Air Force RGM forces. The plan is presented in the
   RGM CFMP which aligns strategy, operations concepts, and capability development. When
   integrated with the other 12 CFMPs, it links Air Force strategic guidance to Air Force
   programming guidance by shaping operational and resourcing health across the near-, mid-,
   and far-terms. Due to the nature of the information about RGM capabilities, the RGM
   CFMP document is classified SECRET.
   6.1.3. Relationship to the C2 CFL. CSAF designated the Commander, Air Combat
   Command as the Air Force CFLI for C2. The Air Force C2 CFL is designated as the focal
   point for Service-wide C2 governance. Via its C2 division, AMC/A3C, AMC is engaged
   with the C2 CFL on all issues connecting the MAF to the Air Force-wide C2 structure. AMC
   prepares air mobility inputs to the C2 CFMP and participates in the C2 Council of Colonels,
   an Air Force-wide group focusing on Air Force C2 challenges. AMC also provides
   information to and participates in the 3-star level Operations (Ops) Readiness General
   Officer Steering Group (GOSG). The Ops Readiness GOSG has replaced the C2 GOSG and
   now focuses on a broader range of operational issues, to include C2. AMC/A8P submits
   AMC’s C2 POM issues to the C2 Core Function Team IAW annual PPI.
   6.1.4. Relationship to the Cyberspace Superiority CFL. CSAF designated the Commander,
   Air Force Space Command as the Cyberspace Superiority CFL. The relationship between
   AMC and the Cyberspace Superiority CFL is the same as it is with the C2 CFL. Via its
   Operations division, AMC/A6O is engaged with the Cyberspace Superiority CFL on all
   issues connecting the MAF to the Air Force-wide Cyberspace Superiority structure. AMC
   provides inputs to the Cyberspace Superiority CFMP to ensure air mobility equities are
   represented.
   6.1.5. The Relationship Between AMC and the Information Operations (IO) CFL. CSAF
   designated the Commander, Air Combat Command as the IO CFL. The relationship between
   AMC and the IO CFL is the same as it is with the Cyber CFL and C2 CFL. The Air Force IO
   CFL is designated as the focal point for Service-wide IO governance. Via its Combat
   Operations division, AMC/A3D, AMC is engaged with the IO CFL on all issues connecting
   the MAF to the Air Force-wide IO structure. AMC prepares air mobility inputs and
AMCI10-202V1 5 AUGUST 2014                                                               21


   participates in the IO Team Chief Meetings which is an Air Force-wide Colonels group
   focusing on Air Force IO challenges. ACC provides the budget for AMC IO as there is no
   AMC POM for IO.
   6.1.6. Table 6.1 below depicts the AF Service Core Functions (SCF), CFLs, and AMC
   leads.

   6.1.7. Since AMC/A5/8 is the command’s CFL POC,               all   directorates   should
   coordinate/inform AMC/A5/8 of engagements with other CFLs.

Administrative Control (ADCON)—ADCON is the direction or exercise of authority over
subordinate or other organizations with respect to administration and support, including
organization of Service forces, control of resources and equipment, personnel management,
logistics, individual and unit training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and
other matters not included in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations.
ADCON is synonymous with administration and support responsibilities identified in Title 10,
USC. This is the authority necessary to fulfill Military Department statutory responsibilities for
administration and support. ADCON may be delegated to and exercised by commanders of
Service forces assigned to a CCDR at any echelon at or below the level of Service component
command. ADCON is subject to the command authority of CCDRs. ADCON may be delegated
to and exercised by commanders of Service commands assigned within Service authorities.
Service commanders exercising ADCON will not usurp the authorities assigned by a CCDR
having COCOM over commanders of assigned Service forces. (JP 1).
Air Force Forces (AFFOR)—USAF component assigned to a Joint Force Commander (JFC) at
the unified, subunified, or Joint Task Force (JTF) level. AFFOR includes the COMAFFOR, the
AFFOR staff (A-staff/personal staff), the AOC, and all USAF forces and personnel assigned or
attached. (Air Force Forces Command and Control Enabling Concept, Change 3).
Air Force forces—Integration (AFFOR-I)—A division within 18 AF that serves as liaison
with applicable AMC staff organizations for coordination and implementation of reach back
capabilities.
AMCI10-202V1 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                        27


Air Force Forces (AFFOR) Staff—The AFFOR Staff consists of the A-staff and personal staff
and assists the COMAFFOR in performing theater engagement activities, service, joint and
combined exercises, adaptive planning (the Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG)-directed
replacement for deliberate and crisis action planning), force deployment, force beddown and
sustainment, force redeployment and the operational and administrative support functions
outlined later in this document. AFFOR staff manpower may be matrixed to augment the AOC
phase 0/1 operations. (Air Force Forces Command and Control Enabling Concept, Change 3)
Air Forces Transportation (AFTRANS)—Air Force Transportation Component.
Air and Space Operations Center (AOC)—The senior agency of the Air Force component
commander that provides command and control of Air Force air and space operations and
coordinates with other components and Services (JP 1-02).
Combatant Command (Command Authority) (COCOM)—Combatant commanders
(CCDRs) exercise COCOM of assigned forces. The CCDR may delegate operational control
(OPCON), tactical control (TACON), or establish support command relationships of assigned
forces. Unless otherwise directed by the President or SecDef, COCOM may not be delegated.
(JP 1).
Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR)—The COMAFFOR is the USAF officer
designated as commander of the USAF component command assigned to a Joint Force
Commander at the unified, subunified, and Joint Task Force level. (Volume 1, Basic Doctrine).
Component—MAJCOM (C-MAJCOM)—A type of MAJCOM that is the USAF component
to a Unified Combatant Command. For example, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) is a C-MAJCOM
that is the USAF component to United States Pacific Command (USPACOM). A C-MAJCOM
is commanded by the Commander of Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) and includes supporting
staff, one or more C-NAFs (through which it presents its forces to the Combatant Commander
(CCDR)), and all assigned and attached forces. The C-MAJCOM integrates, at the strategic
level, component activities across all phases of conflict. NOTE: A MAJCOM can be both a C-
MAJCOM and a Lead MAJCOM. (AFI 38-101).
Component—NAF (C-NAF)—A C-NAF is a specialized category of NAF that is structured to
perform an operational and warfighting mission in support of a Unified Combatant Command
(UCC). The C-NAF is a command echelon directly under the control of an operational
MAJCOM. The C-NAF will plan, command, control, execute and assess air, space and
information operation capabilities across the full range of military operations. The C-NAF
consists of an AFFOR staff and an Air and Space Operations Center (AOC). Air Force forces
and units will be assigned or attached as required to support the UCC. (AFI 38-101).
Cyberspace Operations (CO)—The employment of cyber capabilities where the primary
purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace. Such operations include computer
network operations and activities to operate and defend the Global Information Grid. (CM-0856-
09 1 Sep 09).
Defensive Counter-Cyber (DCC)—All defensive countermeasures designed to detect, identify,
intercept, and destroy or negate harmful activities attempting to penetrate or attack through
cyberspace. DCC missions are designed to preserve friendly network integrity, availability, and
security, and protect friendly cyber capabilities from attack, intrusion, or other malicious activity
by pro-actively seeking, intercepting, and neutralizing adversarial cyber means which present
 28                                                             AMCI10-202V1 5 AUGUST 2014


such threats. DCC operations may include: military deception via honeypots and other
operations; actions to adversely affect adversary and/ or intermediary systems engaged in a
hostile act/ imminent hostile act; and redirection, deactivation, or removal of malware engaged in
a hostile act/imminent hostile act.
Director of Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR)—Normally a senior officer who is familiar with
the area of responsibility or joint operations area and possesses an extensive background in air
mobility operations. When established, the director of mobility forces serves as the designated
agent for all air mobility issues in the area of responsibility or joint operations area, and for other
duties as directed. (JP 3-17).
Direct liaison authorized (DIRLAUTH)—That authority granted by a commander (any level)
to a subordinate to directly consult or coordinate an action with a command or agency within or
outside of the granting command. Direct liaison authorized is more applicable to planning than
operations and always carries with it the requirement of keeping the commander granting direct
liaison authorized informed. Direct liaison authorized is a coordination relationship, not an
authority through which command may be exercised. (JP 1-02).
Distributed Operations—The process of conducting operations from independent or
interdependent nodes in a teaming manner. Some operational planning or decision-making may
occur from outside the joint area of operations. The goal of a distributed operation is to support
the operational commander in the field; it is not a method of command from the rear. (Volume
1, Basic Doctrine).
Global Air Mobility Support System (GAMSS)—Provides responsive, worldwide support
capability to airlift and air refueling operations. This system consists of an existing but limited
set of CONUS and en route locations. Deployable forces capable of augmenting the fixed en
route locations or establishing en route locations where none exist are an integral part of the
system. (Annex 3-17, Air Mobility Operations).
Information Operations (IO)—The integrated employment, during military operations, of
information-related capabilities in concert with other lines of operations to influence, disrupt,
corrupt, or usurp the decision-making of adversaries and potential adversaries, while protecting
our own. (JP 3-13).
Information Operations Team (IOT)—The 618 IOT for the 618 AOC (TACC) is the
USTRANSCOM’s air component commander’s focal point for IO and Cyberspace planning and
execution. The 618 IOT is integrated into the 618 AOC (TACC) planning, execution and
assessment processes as a cross functional specialty team that is nested within the Current
Operations Directorate, XOO as the Information Operations Division, XOOI. The IOT
coordinates IO and Cyberspace Operations (CO) normal intelligence requirements with the
AMC/A2A and A2O to provide the requisite intelligence support to affect mission
accomplishment. The IOT submits intelligence requirements and requests for information (RFIs)
through the AMC/A2A. It is matrixed to support 18 AF deliberate and crisis planning and the
AMC Cyber Defense Working Group (CDWG).
Joint force—A general term applied to a force composed of significant elements, assigned or
attached, of two or more Military Departments, operating under a single joint commander
authorized to exercise operational control. (JP 1- 02).
AMCI10-202V1 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                         29


Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC)—The commander within a unified
command, subordinate unified command, or joint task force responsible to the establishing
commander for making recommendations on the proper employment of assigned, attached,
and/or made available for tasking air forces; planning and coordinating air operations; or
accomplishing such operational missions as may be assigned. The joint force air component
commander is given the authority necessary to accomplish missions and tasks assigned by the
establishing commander. (JP 1-02).
Joint Force Commander (JFC)—A general term applied to a combatant commander,
subunified commander, or joint task force commander authorized to exercise combatant
command (command authority) [COCOM] or operational control [OPCON] over a joint force.
(JP 1- 02).
Lead MAJCOM (L—MAJCOM)—A type of MAJCOM that consolidates responsibilities for a
particular function in a single MAJCOM, supporting the entire Air Force as applicable. For
example, Air Education and Training Command is the Lead MAJCOM for education and
training. (AFI 38-101).
Major Command (MAJCOM)—A major subdivision of the Air Force that is assigned a major
part of the Air Force mission. A MAJCOM is directly subordinate to Headquarters US Air
Force. (AFI 38-101)
Mobility Air Forces (MAF)—The mobility air forces are comprised of those air components
and Service components that are assigned air mobility forces and/or that routinely exercise
command authority over their operations. (JP 1-02).
Operational Control (OPCON)—OPCON is the command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of CCMD and may be delegated within the
command. OPCON is able to be delegated from and lesser authority than COCOM. It is the
authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing
and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving
authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
accomplish the mission. (JP 1).
Operations Security (OPSEC)—A process of identifying critical information and subsequently
analyzing friendly actions attendant to military operations and other activities to: a. identify those
actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems; b. determine indicators that
hostile intelligence systems might obtain that could be interpreted or pieced together to derive
critical information in time to be useful to adversaries; and c. select and execute measures that
eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary
exploitation. (JP 1-02).
Skip Echelon—A concept under which one level of command may be “skipped” for prescribed
tasks for which that headquarters is not responsible for, or manned to support. As an example, a
Wing may skip the AFCHQ and go straight to the MAJCOM when looking for Child
Development Center support. The specific skip-echelon functions will be further defined in
supporting Air Force Instructions and tactics, techniques and procedures. (AFI 38-101).
Skip Echelon Structure—Major commands (MAJCOM) sit on top of a skip-echelon staffing
structure. MAJCOMs, wings and squadrons possess the full range of staff functions needed to
perform required tasks. Numbered/named air forces (NAF), groups and flights have no or
 30                                                         AMCI10-202V1 5 AUGUST 2014


minimal staff. These tactical echelons are designed to increase operational effectiveness rather
than to review and transmit paperwork. The chain of command and responsibility for mission
accomplishment runs through commanders at all levels. (AFI 38-101).
Tactical Control (TACON)—TACON is an authority over assigned or attached forces or
commands, or military capability or forces made available for tasking, that is limited to the
detailed direction and control of movements and maneuvers within the operational area
necessary to accomplish assigned missions or tasks assigned by the commander exercising
OPCON or TACON of the attached force. TACON is able to be delegated from and lesser
authority than OPCON and may be delegated to and exercised by commanders at any echelon at
or below the level of CCMD. (JP 1).
AMCI10-202V1 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                        31

               TASKS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE AMC SHARED STAFF

A2.1. For a complete list of tasks and functions, refer to the following EIM SharePoint site:
https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/a3/A3R/A3RI-Integration/A3RI_Team/Prototyping/AMC_RACI/
Lists/AMC%20RACI%20Coord/Responsible.aspx
A2.2. The tasks and functions of the AMC shared staff are captured in a RACI Matrix. A RACI
Matrix is a common management tool used to identify the various stakeholders in a project, or
operating process, and their roles within it. The matrix divides activities or tasks into four
different roles: Responsible, Approve, Coordinate, and Informed. For the purpose of the AMC
Roles, Responsibilities, Relationships, and Authorities Guidance document, these terms are
defined as follows:
   A2.2.1. R-Responsible. Designates the staff office of primary responsibility for doing the
   work on behalf of the “CC” approval authority (the “A” column). This OPR leads any team
   effort across the staff for the task. Only one “R” per line entry.
   A2.2.2. A-Approve. Commanders own approval authority. They are ultimately accountable
   although they may delegate approval to appropriate staff. Choose one of the following
   Commanders for the “A” column based on the following criteria:
       A2.2.2.1. AMC/CC if the task is related to MAF policy, Lead MAJCOM responsibilities, or
       the task is one the AMC/CC retains decision authority over in the role of COMAFFOR.
       A2.2.2.2. 18 AF/CC if the task is associated with MAF operational support to
       USTRANSCOM.
       A2.2.2.3. 618 AOC (TACC)/CC if the task is Tactical Control (TACON) of airlift, air
       refueling, aeromedical evacuation or GAMSS forces.
       A2.2.2.4. Expeditionary Center/CC is associated with ADCON of units assigned to the
       USAF EC. NOTE: CDRUSSTRATCOM is reserved as a choice only for TF-294 tasks.
   A2.2.3. C-Coordinate/Collaborate. Organizations that are designated with coordination/
   collaboration have a voice and must be consulted for this task to be complete. If the coordinating
   organization has an issue, this issue must be resolved or elevated until resolution is achieved.
   This column could include one or many organizations with a focus primarily on internal AMC
   structure. Significant organizations external to AMC may also be added. A general
   organizational category, “Z”, is intended for “External to AMC Peer Agencies”.
   A2.2.4. I-Informed. Informed organizations have the right to be informed. The “R”
   organization for a particular task must inform other organizations with the “I” designation.
   A2.2.5. This RACI Matrix consists of activities (tasks) identified and performed by the AMC
   and 18 AF Staffs. This RACI Matrix can serve many useful purposes. For example, it can be
   used as a reference to develop checklists, training programs, or process models. It can be linked
   to mission essential tasks (METs) and for requirements/needs determination. With respect to the
   MAF C2 Campaign Plan, this RACI Matrix is the starting point for a fundamental goal of more
   clearly defining MAF decision nodes, associated decision authorities, the information required
   for those decisions, as well as the source of that information who is doing what for whom.
