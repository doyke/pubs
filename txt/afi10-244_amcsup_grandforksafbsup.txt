include: AFI 10-244, 1 September 2005, and AFI 10-244_AMCSUP_I, 15 November 2010 are
supplemented as follows: 2.7.3.8.1 changed word ―last‖ to ―first‖, 2.7.4.11.2 changed word from
‖semi-annually‖ to‖ annually.‖ This supplement consolidates the procedures and criteria that
support Grand Forks AFB’s Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEF) Unit Type Code (UTC)
Reporting Tool. This supplement provides procedures for those areas listed in AFI 10-244 that
require wing-level direction. It applies to all 319 ABW units.
2.4.3.1.1. (Added) An Enabler Force is defined as any individual member or equipment
package deploying in support of a mobility package or AEF cycle, but is not directly attached to
that package/AEF. GFAFB Enabler Forces will be employed in support of mobility packages as
directed by AMC/A3. Unit AEF Reporting Tool (ART) POCs will include in the remarks
section of enabler UTCs as much information as possible to ensure the AEF schedulers have a
clear picture of each UTC’s status.
2.7.3.6.4.1. (Added) All unit ART monitors will receive initial training within 30 calendar days
of their appointment by their Squadron CC. Unit ART monitors will not be granted an ART
account without initial training. Additionally, all unit ART monitors will receive refresher
training at least annually. Training will be scheduled and provided by the Wing ART POC, but
will also be provided at the request of any unit ART POC.
2.7.3.8.1. (Added) The Wing ART POC will brief Wing ART status to the Wing Commander
and key staff at the monthly Wing Readiness Brief.
2.7.3.10.1. (Added) Unit commanders will keep their respective group commander informed of
their unit’s ART status.
2.7.3.11.2.1. (Added) The wing ART POC will maintain each signed Commander’s Approval
Report used for the last ART update in an approved safe in the Logistics Plans' office.
2.7.4.2.1.2. (Added) Unit ART POCs serve as the focal point for the unit. They are responsible
for making sure appropriate updates are made in the ART system. Unit ART POCs will present
the information contained in ART to the unit commander to ensure information reported is
correct.
2.7.4.11.1. (Added) Reporting procedure: The unit ART POC will enter updated data in each
assigned UTC at a minimum of every 30 calendar days. In order to generate a Commander’s
Approval – Readiness Assessment Report, all UTCs must be placed in CC Review. The unit
commander must review and sign the Commander’s Approval – Readiness Assessment Report.
The unit ART POC will submit the unit commander’s approval in the ART database. ART
reports will be briefed to group commanders monthly. The unit ART POC will deliver the
signed copy of the Commander’s Approval – Readiness Assessment Report to the Wing ART
POC by the designated deadline each month.

2.7.4.11.2. (Added) Reporting not updated or not performed IAW this instruction will be noted
on the ART staff assistance visit (SAV) Out-brief Report, which will be provided to each unit
commander annually, upon completion of the SAV. The unit commander will provide
feedback/corrective action for identified discrepancies within 30 days of receipt of the report.
3.8.1.1. (Added) The wing ART POC will review adds/changes/deletes in the ART database
daily and notify affected units. The unit ART POC must update added/changed/deleted UTCs
within    24    hours     of    notification.     The  ART    website   is   located  at
