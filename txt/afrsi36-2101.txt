                                            Chapter 1

                                     RECRUITER TOURS

1.1. Stabilized Tours of Duty. Recruiters are assigned to, from, and within AFRS IAW AFI
36-2110 and the SPECAT Assignments Guide; and are subject to AFPC/DPAA approval. The
8R stabilized tour of duty begins upon in-processing. Recruiters serve the AETC/CC’s
established tour length which is currently 4 years. Upon in-processing, recruiters receive an
assignment availability code (AAC) 50 which is computed 4 years from the member’s date
arrived station (DAS) or in-processing date, if the member enters recruiting duty within local
area. AAC 50 defers members from reassignment, including overseas (OS), unless otherwise
determined by AFPC/DPAA. Those reassigned overseas will serve the standard prescribed OS
tour, if they did not volunteer for the extended long tour. Overseas recruiters do not receive an
AAC 50, since their date eligible for return from overseas (DEROS) serves the same purpose.
Recruiters reassigned on a local or fully-funded PCS, to include those returning from OS, receive
a new AAC 50 computed from DAS/inprocessing.
1.2. Assignment Diversion. AETC/A1KA is the requesting authority, and AFPC/DPAA is the
approval authority for all assignment diversions. Neither recruiting squadrons (RCS), nor
recruiting group (RCG) personnel will contact affected members concerning a diversion.
AETC/A1KAS will coordinate all diversions, which will be held to an absolute minimum. Some
reasons for diversions are out-of-cycle losses; deletion of unit manning document (UMD)
authorization, unit movement, and unit deactivation.
1.3. Temporary Duty (TDY) Pending Administrative or Disciplinary Action. When an
Airman assigned to AFRS becomes involved in an incident that may result in unfavorable
publicity, the RCS or RCG commander is authorized to place the Airman in TDY status (if no
other duty alternative exists in the recruiter’s local area). Commanders must exercise caution to
ensure the least expensive duty option is used. Approval of this TDY is contingent upon the
concurrence of the gaining activity, if applicable, and the recruiting unit’s ability to fund the
action.
1.4. Reassignment of Recruiters on Completion of Tour.
     1.4.1. Recruiters receive assignment instructions through their servicing military personnel
     section (MPS) or virtual Military Personnel Flight (vMPF), at the completion of their tour of
     duty, if returning to their AFSC. Recruiters approved and released for another 8R tour are
     reassigned based on the MOI cycle, according to their AAC 50 expiration date. For normal
     PCS actions, Continental United States (CONUS) time-on-station (TOS) minimum
     requirements are 24 months for an OS assignment and 48 months for a stateside assignment,
     IAW AFI 36-2110. AFPC/DPAA considers an Airman’s OS vulnerability, CONUS
     requirements, and assignment preferences in the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS)
     when determining reassignments.
     1.4.2. OS recruiters may apply for extension of their OS tour IAW AFI 36-2110. They will
     complete an AFRS IMT 4, Recruiter Reassignment Intent Memorandum of Intent (MOI), at
     the same time they complete their date eligible to return from overseas (DEROS) election.
     Attachment 2 presents instructions on how to complete the memorandum of intent (MOI)
     application process. Recruiters serving in OS tour areas, whose recruiting tour is not being
AFRSI36-2101 18 MARCH 2014                                                                5


  extended, will be reassigned in their primary Air Force specialty code (PAFSC) and be
  subject to the same rules as other OS returnees. However, depending on requirements,
  recruiters completing OS tours maybe reassigned to recruiting duties in the CONUS.
  Reassignment, if approved, is effective upon completion of the OS tour, unless DEROS
  curtailment is requested and approved by AFPC.
  1.4.3. Intergroup or intragroup reassignments will not be made without prior approval from
  HQ AFRS/RSX, AETC/A1KA, and AFPC/DPAA. Chapter 3 explains the policy and
  procedures for evaluating and reassigning recruiters (8R) within AFRS.

        ENLISTED ACCESSIONS (EA) RECRUITER PROCUREMENT PROCESS

2.1. Recruiter Screening Team (RST). An AETC special duty briefing team schedules visits
to all major Air Force installations to provide guidance and information to interested Air Force
members, installation commanders, first sergeants, and supervisors regarding special duty
opportunities in AETC. The RST (HQ AFRS/RSXPR) are part of this briefing team. RST
promotes recruiting duty, explains the recruiter selection process, benefits of recruiting duty, and
screens/hires potential applicants for special duty tours in recruiting.
2.2. Procedures. Volunteers for recruiting duty will complete and send a recruiter application
package,                (located               on                https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC134BF10FB5E044080020E329A9), to
the RST. The RST will screen and interview all volunteers in the grades of E-4 through E-7 to
fill EA recruiter vacancies. Potential EA recruiters will be hired based on eligibility and
recommendation from the RST.
2.3. Responsibilities.
     2.3.1. IAW AFI 36-2110, AFPC maintains listing of Air Force-wide recruiter candidates in
     order to fill current and projected vacancies, and serves as final approval authority for all
     assignment actions.
     2.3.2. IAW Air Force personnel policy, AETC manages and oversees all assignment actions,
     Advertises EA vacancies, selects candidates for assignment based on AFI 36-2110, secures
     release from current AFSC on potential candidates, and provides assignment
     instructions/policy. AETC conducts quarterly assignment cycles for 8R000 candidates.
     8R000 candidates must be eligible for recruiting, be “tentatively hired” by HQ AFRS,
     released from their AFSC for an 8R tour, and matched to one of their assignment preferences
     they submit during the assignment cycle to become an 8R000.
     2.3.3. The RST interviews and screens qualified volunteers and EA recruiter candidates to
     fill current and projected vacancies and submits recommendations to AETC/A1KAS,
     2.3.4. RCSs maintain a system for identifying EA recruiter vacancies and projected
     vacancies, and provide their respective RCG with validated vacancies needing to be
     advertised during the quarterly assignment cycle.
     2.3.5. RCGs maintain a system for identifying EA recruiter vacancies and projected
     vacancies, and provide HQ AFRS/RSXP (Personnel) validated vacancies needing to be
     advertised during the quarterly assignment cycle.

                                          Chapter 3

                  REASSIGNMENT OF RECRUITERS WITHIN AFRS

3.1. Recruiter Progression. Progression of recruiters is important for the individual and AFRS;
however, moving recruiters may be necessary to meet mission requirements, improve the
recruiting market, and replace personnel losses.
3.2. Normal Recruiter Progression. There are three tiers to the recruiter progression pyramid,
as indicated in Figure 3.1 and below:
   3.2.1. Tier 1 (8R000). Recruiter positions in this tier are manned by Airmen (SrA - MSgt)
   who have volunteered or have been selected for their initial 8R000 stabilized recruiting tour
   of duty. These recruiters are typically identified as EA (entry-level) recruiters.
   3.2.2. Tier 2 (8R200). Recruiter positions in this tier are manned by Airmen (SSgt - MSgt)
   from current recruiters requesting another tour in recruiting or from the Air Force pool of
   qualified former recruiters.
   3.2.3. Tier 3 (8R300). Recruiter positions in this tier are manned by Airmen (TSgt –
   CMSgt) from current recruiters requesting another tour in recruiting or from the Air Force
   pool of qualified former recruiters. Please reference AFI36-2117, Career Recruiter Force.

3.3. Assignment Selection. Recruiter retention and reassignment will follow a four-step
process: (1) completion of the MOI, (2) validation of requirements (advertisements), (3)
matching eligible recruiters with known requirements (advertisements), and (4) loading of
assignments, as follows:
     3.3.1. Step 1, Completion of the MOI:
        3.3.1.1. AETC/A1KAS and AFRS identify all PCS-eligible recruiters for a specific
        assignment cycle using their AAC 50 expiration date. Individuals identified must
        complete AFRS IMT 4 (MOI), indicating a desire to return to their PAFSC or requesting
        another tour in recruiting. Attachment 2 provides guidelines for the MOI process.
        3.3.1.2. A recruiter who indicates a desire to be released from recruiter duty, or who has
        not been recommended for retention by their RCG commander, will be considered for
        assignment back to his/her AFSC during AFPC’s CONUS Mandatory Mover
        (CMM)/Overseas Returnee cycle and will have a RNLTD on or after AAC 50 expiration
        date.
        3.3.1.3. A recruiter released from his or her career field by AFPC who has an approved
        MOI on file for retention in recruiting will be identified to AETC/A1KAS as a candidate
        for reassignment during their MOI (8R) assignment cycle. Their RCG commander is the
        approving authority on the MOI.
        3.3.1.4. A recruiter whose PAFSC has been withdrawn and who desires reassignment
        from recruiting duty must request to return to a previously held AFSC IAW AFI 36-2101,
        or apply for retraining in conjunction with his or her DOA. If the member’s AFSC
        Functional Manager does not approve reinstatement of the AFSC or if retraining is not
        approved, the member remains an 8R resource.
     3.3.2. Step 2, Validation of Requirements (Advertisements). AETC/A1KAS suspenses
     AFRS to identify and forward all valid requirements for each quarterly assignment cycle.
     3.3.3. Step 3, Matching Eligible Recruiters With Known Requirements (Advertisements):
        3.3.3.1. AETC/A1KAS conducts 8R assignment cycles quarterly. AETC will contact
        each eligible candidate and provide validated vacancies they can volunteer for. Normally
        candidates are provided 2 weeks to send their assignment preferences directly back to
        AETC. A recruiter with an approved MOI who is released by AFPC from their PAFSC,
        and has been approved for another 8R tour, may (and is encouraged to) volunteer for as
        many positions as he or she is qualified to perform.
        3.3.3.2. After the advertisements closeout, AETC/A1KAS matches recruiters to
        advertised vacancies IAW AFI 36-2110. Individuals are racked/stacked IAW AF
        assignment policy. Preferences are reviewed and considered within the recommended
        MOI category according to highest to lowest mission vacancy priority. The highest
        priority position will be filled first by the most eligible and qualified volunteer. If AETC
        is unable to match an assignment based on a recruiter’s desires, the recruiter may be
        matched for reassignment based on AFRS needs.
        3.3.3.3. When a vacancy goes unfilled, it will be advertised the following cycle. NOTE:
        If the requirement is critical and has been advertised at least once, AFRS may request an
AFRSI36-2101 18 MARCH 2014                                                                     9


      exception to policy (paragraph 3.4.) for AETC to openly advertise to the next eligible
      recruiter pool.
      3.3.3.4. AFRS/CC has by name request selection authority to identify all Production
      Superintendent candidates. Production Superintendent candidates are reassigned IAW
      AFI 36-2110, by AETC/A1KAAS.
      3.3.3.5. Chief Master Sergeants (or selectees) in SDI 8R000 will not be reassigned
      within AFRS without the approval of the AFRS/CC and the Air Force Senior Leadership
      Management Office Chief’s Group (AFSLMO/CG).
   3.3.4. Step 4, Updating Assignment Requests:
      3.3.4.1. AETC/A1KAS updates tentative reassignments in MilPDS, which flows to
      AFPC for final approval.
      3.3.4.2. Once AFPC approves the assignment match (including waivers), AETC will
      provide AFRS a spreadsheet identifying locations and inbounds.
          3.3.4.2.1. If a recruiter receives a non-volunteer 8R assignment and desires to decline
          the assignment, he or she can request reclama of the assignment and return to their
          AFSC. This only applies to current 8R000 and 8R200 personnel that still have a valid
          AFSC. The member requests reclama through AFRS chain of command to AETC. If
          approved, the request is sent to AFPC for approval/disapproval and the member’s
          original AAC 50 is reinstated to identify him or her to return to their AFSC. Reclama
          requests are not processed through the military personnel section (MPS) and an AF
          Form 964, PCS, TDY Deployments, or Training Declination Statement, should not be
          accomplished. Reclama of assignment is different than declining retainability for an
          assignment (AF Form 964) which has career-impacting results.
          3.3.4.2.2. If a recruiter volunteers for a specific position and subsequently does not
          desire the reassignment, he or she must decline retainability (if eligible) for the
          assignment by signing an AF Form 964, which is processed through the MPS. Once
          AFPC receives the AF Form 964 from the MPS, the member’s AAC 50 may be
          reinstated or the member may remain on assignment if he or she has the minimum
          retainability required. Member will be notified of their disposition.
          3.3.4.2.3. All assignment matches are tentative, pending AFPC approval. Under no
          circumstances will a recruiter tentatively selected for possible reassignment take any
          personal actions until notified by the servicing MPS or vMPF. Once AFPC approves
          the assignment, an assignment notification RIP flows to the member’s vMPF, which
          is the member’s official notification.
3.4. Reassigning Recruiters Not Eligible for PCS or MOI.
   3.4.1. At times, the assignment system is unable to meet the needs of the mission. After a
   quarterly assignment cycle is conducted, AFRS may identify critical unfilled advertised
   positions from the cycle and entertain Exception to Policy (ETP) requests. ETPs should only
   be done for critical mission reasons. ETP candidates are identified and selected by AETC
   and forwarded to AFPC for approval. All vacancies must be advertised to all PCS and MOI
   eligibles. By-name requests are not accepted for consideration.

   3.4.2. RCG commanders have approval authority for RCS requests for valid duty moves to
   positions within the same duty location code (DLOC) and tier. RCSs will submit an AFRS
   IMT 2, Duty Title Change Without Change of Duty Location, verifying there is no change to
   the current DLOC or SDI tier. The AAC 50 does not change with employment flexibility
   moves. AFRS, AETC, and AFPC must approve reassignment to positions in a different
   DLOC/tier as an ETP. In this instance, the recruiter does not accrue PCS entitlements.
   3.4.3. Requests must be completed prior to the next advertisement cycle. The RCG
   commander will identify through HQ AFRS/RSXP to AETC/A1KAS the recruiter he or she
   desires to fill the critical vacancy.
   3.4.4. For military entrance processing station (MEPS) liaison supervisor (MLS) vacancies,
   the RCG commander may approve a valid duty title move of a qualified liaison
   noncommissioned officer (LNCO) to MLS without having to advertise a minimum of one
   cycle. In this case, the RCG must ask AETC to advertise an LNCO requirement in place of
   the MLS. The AAC 50 does not change with these employment flexibility moves.
   3.4.5. Tier 1 recruiters must complete 24 months as an EA Recruiter before consideration for
   a higher tier (8R200 or 8R300).
3.5. Request for Exception to Policy. Please see paragraph 3.4 for guidance.

                    MANNING RECRUITING SUPPORT POSITIONS

4.1. Guidance.
   4.1.1. AETC/A1KAS selects Airmen from applications submitted under SPECAT guidance.
   Reassignments must meet current assignment rules and policies and are subject to AFPC
   approval. After assignment selection and prior to departure, Airmen will not be removed
   from an assignment unless they are promoted, reclassified, or otherwise become ineligible for
   reassignment.
   4.1.2. Recruiting support personnel will not normally be reassigned to another recruiting
   support position until they have completed their initial 4-year tour. Any request for
   reassignment is subject to approval by AETC/A1KAS and AFPC/DPAA, and base residency
   requirements apply.
4.2. Stabilized Tours of Duty.

   does not necessarily occur on the AAC’s expiration date. After expiration of the AAC,
   incumbents remain in place until reassigned due to OS selection, CONUS selection for
   another special duty assignment, exercise of voluntary assignment options, or other
   reassignment actions outlined in AFI 36-2110.
4.3. Procedures.
   4.3.1. On completion of the minimum tour, recruiting support personnel will remain in the
   special duty until reassigned or selected for another special duty. RCGs will notify HQ
   AFRS/RSXP of any projected vacancy at RCG or a subordinate RCS. Once a loss is
   projected, AETC/A1KAS will advertise the vacancy via the AFPC’s EQUAL-Plus system.
   Application is made in accordance with the SPECAT Assignment Guide and AFI 36-2110.
   4.3.2. Recruiting support personnel may pursue voluntary reassignment options, such as

                              RECRUITER RELIEF ACTIONS

5.1. Guidance. Prior to initiating a relief action, commanders and supervisors must make every
attempt to bring a recruiter’s performance up to an acceptable level through indoctrination,
training, supervision, performance feedback, and counseling. AFI 36-2909 and AETCI 36-2909
include specific prohibitions on the formation of personal relationships in the recruiting
environment. AFRSI 36-2001 identifies recruiting personnel standards for professionalism and
integrity in the conduct of day-to-day business.
5.2. Types of Relief Actions.
   5.2.1. Relief for Cause. Prior to requesting relief and reassignment of a recruiter, his or her
   immediate commander must consider whether discharge action under AFI 36-3208,
   Administrative Separation of Airmen, or a demotion action under AFI 36-2502, Airman
   Promotion/Demotion Programs, is warranted. AFRS/JA will review relief (for cause)
   actions involving misconduct, malpractice, or other recruiting infractions (irregularities) that
   cannot be classified as misconduct or malpractice. Refer to AFRSI 36-2001, Chapter 1, for
   detailed definitions and additional information. Immediate relief action (for cause) is
   appropriate for any of the following reasons:
       5.2.1.1. Attempting to develop or maintain an intimate personal relationship with
       applicants, such as making sexual advances toward applicants and/or seeking or
       accepting sexual advances or favors from applicants.
       5.2.1.2. Dating an applicant whose processing has begun and has not been terminated
       due to the applicant’s own withdrawal or on the grounds of unacceptability.
       5.2.1.3. Using grade, position, threat, pressure, or promise of return favors or favorable
       treatment in attempts to gain sexual favors from applicants.
       5.2.1.4. Using personal resources to provide applicants with lodging or transportation.
       5.2.1.5. Concealing (or conspiring to conceal) disqualifying factors or attempting to
       qualify an ineligible applicant in violation of directives.
       5.2.1.6. Intentionally misleading and/or misinforming a prospect or applicant regarding
       any aspect of recruiting policy, procedures, entitlements, or benefits or intentionally
       misinforming a prospect or applicant to induce him or her to apply for or accept
       enlistment, commissioning, or appointment.
       5.2.1.7. Attempting to influence lawyers, attorneys, law enforcement officials, or judicial
       authorities to release, dismiss, or drop charges or otherwise mitigating dispositions in
       order to qualify an individual for Air Force enlistment, commissioning, or appointment.
       5.2.1.8. Being deliberately involved in unfavorable incidents not related to recruiting.
       5.2.1.9. Committing acts in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
       5.2.1.10. Failing to maintain Air Force standards of conduct, performance, or
       appearance.
 16                                                            AFRSI36-2101 18 MARCH 2014


   5.2.2. Relief Without Cause. Reassignment action may be necessary for one of four reasons
   (medical, training, family, and financial hardship) as follows:
       5.2.2.1. Medical—unable to perform duties due to medical limitations, such as changes
       in physical profile or stress specifically job related, which prevents the individual from
       performing his or her required duties.
       5.2.2.2. Training—failure to attain or maintain standards of duty performance due to an
       inability to absorb initial or specialized follow-on training and to demonstrate the
       motivation to be successful once training is received. The recruiter will remain in
       training status, and the training will continue until the relief action is approved by
       AFRS/CC.
       5.2.2.3. Family—family problems that could cause, or have caused, the individual’s
       performance to deteriorate or that call into question the individual’s ability to perform the
       required duties for an undetermined period.
       5.2.2.4. Financial Hardship:
           5.2.2.4.1. Financial problems directly or indirectly caused by the location, which
           would not exist or could be prevented if the individual were stationed on a military
           installation. For example, the recruiter’s dependent is required to receive extensive
           medical attention.
           5.2.2.4.2. Financial difficulties not related to recruiting duties or those related to
           mismanagement, neglect, or irresponsibility. Examples include (1) a recruiter owns a
           home in another location and the tenant vacates, causing a financial loss; (2) a
           financial loss caused by a natural disaster (hurricane, tornado, flood, etc.); or (3)
           court-ordered increases in alimony or child support.
5.3. Processing Procedures for Relief Actions (for Cause). The recruiter will be removed
from recruiting duties immediately and the recruiter’s special duty assignment pay (SDAP) will
be terminated. Under no circumstances will a relieved recruiter work in a recruiting (8R000)
capacity once AFRS Form 1321 and AF IMT 2096, Classification/On-the-Job Training Action,
have been initiated. The complete relief case file (original documentation with one copy) will be
forwarded to HQ AFRS/RSXPP no later than 30 days after member is notified. Each case file
will include:
   5.3.1. A completed AFRS Form 1321 with appropriate signatures and dates. Each allegation
   must be summarized in detail. A continuation sheet may be used.
   5.3.2. A notification memorandum to the recruiter, indicating relief action has been initiated.
   The member must acknowledge receipt by a signed endorsement.
   5.3.3. Letters of counseling, admonishment, or reprimand, unfavorable information file
   (UIF), Article 15, and courts-martial results related to the cause.
   5.3.4. A completed AF IMT 2096, changing/removing the recruiter’s SDAP and DAFSC.
   The TDY assignment will be indicated in the remarks, stating the exact location in which the

   duties at a different location, relieved recruiters will NOT be reassigned or updated to
   different position numbers.

   will send medical relief case files through AETC/SG. Cases approved by AFRS/CC will be
   forwarded to AFPC/DPSIDC by the RCS CSS via the Case Management System (CMS).
   CMS cases flow to AFPC Classification for action regarding removal of the 8R SDI. If
   approved, Classification will send the case to AFPC Assignments for assignment disposition.
   5.4.2. Each case file will include the following documents, as appropriate.
      5.4.2.1. A completed AFRS IMT 1374, Recruiter Evaluation, with appropriate

                                           Chapter 6

             DIRECTING PERSONNEL TO AN ALTERNATE WORK SITE.

6.1. Purpose. A member may be directed by their unit commander to perform work at an
alternate work site (other than their permanent duty station).
6.2. Guidance. Unit commanders and orders issuing authorities must ensure the appropriate
levels or per diem, lodging, and travel reimbursements are made to the member. Please refer to
the Joint Federal Travel Regulation paragraphs U3500, U305, U4101, and U4102 for guidance
concerning travel entitlements. Use of government vehicles (GOV) should be maximized, and if
possible, trips should be completed within a 12-hour period. Below is information and examples
of trips for your consideration:
   6.2.1. No entitlements are accrued on any trip by GOV if round trip travel is performed
   within a 12-hour period, and an overnight stay is not required. If the trip takes longer than 12
   hours, or an overnight stay is required, appropriate per diem and lodging reimbursements are
   authorized.
       6.2.1.1. If an enlisted accessions recruiter is required to cover a vacant zone (50 miles
       away), round trip travel by GOV is performed within 12 hours and an overnight stay was
       not required, a funded TDY is not authorized.
       6.2.1.2. Whenever a member is directed to perform duty at an alternate work site outside
       of their normal recruiting zone, commanders have the discretion to authorize occasional
       meals (up to the proportional per diem rate). Occasional meal reimbursement is not
       authorized for member performing normal recruiting duties within their zone.
       6.2.1.3. If a member (assigned as an interim Flight Chief—not selected for a PCS fill)
       travels to a vacant flight office (by GOV) and their travel requires an overnight stay, or
       the trip takes longer than 12 hours, a funded TDY is appropriate.
       6.2.1.4. Unit commanders or orders issuing authorities can never direct members to use
       their personal vehicle (POV) for official travel, but they may authorize POV use.
       Whenever a member is authorized to travel by POV, they should be reimbursed the
       appropriate amount for mileage (miles in excess of their normal daily commute for non-
       TDY trips, and actual miles not to exceed the local authorized travel office estimate for
       airfare for funded TDYs).
6.3. Special Duty Pay. If the temporary duty is more than 90 days, member can receive the
SDAP for those specific duties while performing per unit commander’s discretion. SDAP rate
change should be accomplished as soon as member returns back to permanent duty to avoid
recoupment. If the duty is less than 90 days, the current SDAP should continue and not increase.
For more information on SDAP guidance refer to current AFRS policy letter.
