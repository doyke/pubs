                                                Chapter 2

                                       DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. International Driver’s Licenses. Personnel in possession of an International Driver’s License and a
valid stateside driver’s license may operate non-AFI plated, privately owned vehicles on base. Personnel
operating an AFI plated vehicle, official or not, must possess a valid AFI driver’s license.

2.2. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment.
   2.2.1. Vehicles illegally parked for an unreasonable period, which interfere with traffic operations,
   which create a safety hazard, are disabled in an accident or incident, have been left unattended in, or
   adjacent to, a restricted, controlled, or off-limits area and/or abandoned will be impounded.
       2.2.1.1. For the purpose of this instruction, unreasonable period is defined as longer than 72
       hours in an area other than the Auto Hobby Shop. Vehicles parked in this designated lot must have
       proper authorization and credentials.
   2.2.2. Policies and procedures for towing, searching, impounding and inventorying vehicles will be
   IAW chapter 6 of AFI 31-204.
       2.2.2.1. The fenced lot on the south side of Bldg 41 is designated as the Security Forces Impound
       Lot. Access to the impoundment lot will be controlled by Security Forces Investigations.
       2.2.2.2. IAW AFI 24-301, 31 LRS/LGRO will only tow disabled vehicles creating a traffic safety
       hazard or a fire fighting obstacle on the installation. Any other required movement will be at the
       expense of the owner.

2.3. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. Driving privileges may be suspended or revoked
for cause in accordance with established policy, e.g., accumulation of excessive traffic points (see AFI
31-204, Table 5.2) or driving under the influence (drugs or alcohol). In addition when 31 SFS Reports and
Analysis personnel are notified of persons receiving Host Nation (or other European country) citations for
“serious” off base traffic violations, they will assess the appropriate points for the violation and record
these points in the respective individual driving record maintained in the Security Forces Management
Information System (SFMIS). “Serious” violations are defined as those which result in the temporary sus-
pension of driving privileges; accidents where US military and civilian personnel or their family members
are considered “at-fault”; and for incidents where safety is a factor.
   2.3.1. The 31 MSG/CD may suspend or revoke an individual’s driving privileges based on a specific
   offense (e.g., DUI) or the individual’s overall driving record. Unit commanders may also suspend
   driving privileges for high-risk tendency drivers IAW para 2.5.2. below and route to 31 MSG/CD. For
   specific traffic points suspensions the following applies:
       2.3.1.1. Persons receiving 3 non-moving violations (i.e. parking tickets; registration violations;
       insurance violations) within a 30 day period will have their driving privileges suspended for 30
       days.
       2.3.1.2. Persons accumulating 12 points within 12 months or 18 points within 24 months will
       have their driving privileges suspended for a period of 6 months.
6                                                                    AVIANOABI31-204 25 MAY 2007


       2.3.1.3. Driving Privileges for individuals refusing to submit to Command Directed Installation
       Entry Point Checks will be revoked for a period of one year.
       2.3.1.4. A 31 MSG/CC (CD if CC is absent) signed preliminary suspension letter will be issued to
       all personnel apprehended, detained or charged with driving under the influence (DUI), or who
       refuse to submit to or complete a test for alcohol content. Note: IAW AFI 31-204, suspension
       becomes mandatory revocation on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge (e.g.,
       receipt of BAC in excess of 0.05%). This fact is included in the preliminary suspension letter.
    2.3.2. 31 MSS/DPMAR will forward copies of orders for all personnel departing PCS each month to
    31 SFS/SFAR. These orders will be checked through the SFMIS program and SFAR will forward a
    copy of Individual History Records to include Suspension/Revocation of Driving Privileges to the
    Chief, Security Forces at the gaining Installation.

2.4. Reciprocal Procedures.
    2.4.1. Driving privileges for personnel inbound, suspended or revoked, will remain suspended or
    revoked as specified by their losing base. 31 SFS/SFAR will prepare a suspension/revocation package
    to be signed by the 31 MSG/CD when a report or record is received indicating the driving privileges
    for an inbound individual are suspended or revoked.

2.5. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
    2.5.1. Mandatory Suspensions and Revocations. 31 SFS/SFAR will prepare and staff all mandatory
    suspension and revocation packages IAW AFI 31-204. Coordination includes the 31 SFS/CC and 31
    FW/JA prior to being forwarded to 31 MSG/CD for approval/disapproval.
       2.5.1.1. Suspension or Revocation Appeals. Member’s who desire an appeal hearing must submit
       a personal request to 31 SFS/SFAR within five workdays upon receipt of a suspension or revoca-
       tion letter.
       2.5.1.2. Appeal hearings will be scheduled by the member through 31 MSG/CCEA and will be
       accomplished within 10 workdays.
    2.5.2. Unit Commander Suspensions. Unit commanders have been delegated the right to suspend the
    driving privileges of military personnel (not military dependents) with high-risk tendencies for up to a
    period of 180 days.
       2.5.2.1. Unit commanders may suspend or revoke an individual’s driving privileges based on a
       documented reckless driving, another specific instance, alcohol abuse, or repeat traffic infractions.
       In accordance with AFI 31-204, paragraph 2.7.1., coordinate this notice with the 31 FW/JA.
       2.5.2.2. In accordance with AFI 31-204, unit commanders do not suspend a person's driving priv-
       ileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts made) and offered an administrative hearing.
       If after the hearing the suspension is ordered, the commander must document the suspension in
       writing, to include the reason for the suspension, the recommended length of the suspension, and
       whether or not the suspension applies to POV or GOV privileges.
       2.5.2.3. The unit commander and military member will sign the written suspension and forward to
       31 SFS/SFAR for processing into the Aviano Suspension, Revocation, and Barment (SRB) roster.
       At the time of suspension the military member will handover their AFI driver’s license to the unit
       commander. The unit commander may reinstate the driving privileges of the member before the
AVIANOABI31-204 25 MAY 2007                                                                               7


       end of the suspension if circumstances warrant reinstatement; notify 31 SFS/SFAR in writing to
       ensure the member is removed from the SRB roster.
       2.5.2.4. Upon completion of the suspension period, the unit commander will return the AFI
       license to the member, terminate the suspension or forward a recommendation to the 31 MSG/CD
       for a continued license revocation for up to one year.
       2.5.2.5. Appeals for unit commander suspensions are considered by the 31 MSG/CD. Members
       who desire a hearing must schedule an appeal hearing through 31 MSG/CCEA within five work-
       days upon receipt of a unit commander suspension letter. Appeal hearings will be accomplished
       within ten workdays of the request for a hearing.
   2.5.3. Confiscation of AFI Driver’s License. Unit commanders/first sergeants will physically confis-
   cate the AFI driver’s license of personnel whose driving privileges have been suspended/revoked and
   take it to 31 LRS/LGRO, Operator Records & Licensing.

2.6. Programs for High-Risk Tendency Drivers:
   2.6.1. Unit commanders have the option of directing traffic offenders who have not had their driving
   privileges suspended/revoked to attend a mandatory Course V briefing. All active duty personnel 26
   and under are required to annually attend the Under 26 Local Conditions briefing conducted by the 31
   FW Safety office.
   2.6.2. Attendance at Driver Improvement/Course V is mandatory for all personnel whose driving
   privileges have been suspended as a result of moving violations/incidents, point accumulations, etc.
   Course V attendance is not required for suspension resulting from the accumulation of three non-mov-
   ing violations within a six month period; however, attendance at Local Conditions Refresher Course
   II is mandatory.
   2.6.3. Other programs, such as Alcohol Abuse Evaluation and/or Mental Health Evaluation, can be
   prescribed by instruction or the suspension/revocation letter.

2.7. Restoration of Driving Privileges.
Reinstatement of driving privileges for suspension or revocation will be automatic on the day after the
suspension ends, provided no other violations occur during the suspension or revocation period. The
affected unit commander will ensure the following requirements are met: Successful completion of Driver
Improvement Course V; re-test for AFI license at 31 LRS Operator Records and Licensing Office; Alco-
hol Abuse Evaluation/Mental Health Evaluation, or any other special requirement prescribed by instruc-
tion or suspension letter.

2.8. Restricted Driving Privileges.
The 31 MSG/CD may grant restricted driving privileges or probation on a case-by-case basis. Persons
requesting restricted privileges will forward a letter requesting specific privileges endorsed by their com-
mander through 31 SFS/SFAR prior to being forwarded to 31 MSG/CD. Privileges will only be granted
for extreme hardship cases.

                                                  Chapter 3

                                 MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION

3.1. Registration Policy. The United States Air Force and 31st Fighter Wing value the amicable relations
we enjoy with our Italian hosts. Unfortunately, there are persistent anti-American elements in or transiting
the vicinity of Aviano Air Base that can constitute a serious and credible threat to the safety and security
of the military and civilian personnel in the 31 FW, its tenant units, and their families. Further, the distinc-
tive U.S. Armed Forces Italy (AFI) license plates normally issued are a highly visible indicator of U.S.
citizenship and could put Aviano personnel in danger of attack from terrorists or anti-American citizens in
the region. For the reasons listed above, and in the interest of increased force protection, all Aviano per-
sonnel who register vehicles with Pass and Registration “must”, per 31 FW/CC, display “Italian Cover
Plates” on their vehicles. These cover plates will be provided at no cost to authorized registrants through
the Pass and Registration office using the procedures listed below. Note: All rules in this instruction
which affect “AFI plated” vehicles are also applicable to “Cover Plated” vehicles.
    3.1.1. The United States Navy Europe (USNAVEUR), through the Naval Support Activity
    (NAV-SUPPACT), Naples, Italy, is the United States European Command (USECOM) executive
    agent for administration of vehicle registration for all U.S. and NATO military and civilian personnel
    assigned to bases in Italy.
    3.1.2. Ownership of vehicles registered by U. S. military activities in Italy is documented on
    NAVEURGEN Form 11240/3, Military Registration and Certificate of Title of Motor Vehicle, which
    is a dual-language (U.S. - Italian) document.
    3.1.3. Vehicles imported into Italy can be legally driven for 21 days using the current (not expired)
    stateside or foreign country registration/license plates. The 21 day period starts the day the vehicle is
    released from the shipping agency or is driven into Italy.
       3.1.3.1. The POV Processing Center will notify Pass and Registration once a vehicle arrives in the
       European theater. After the vehicle arrives at Aviano AB, the owner will report to Transcar to
       determine what size rear bracket will fit the vehicle. Once determined, personnel will report to
       Pass and Registration with a copy of his/her orders to obtain an AFI/Cover plate number. Once the
       member obtains insurance with the plate number, he/she will return to Pass and Registration with
       their insurance card and AFI driver’s license. The member will then receive his/her plates and
       temporary vehicle registration and proceed to the POV Processing Center to pick-up the vehicle.
    3.1.4. Vehicles utilized strictly for off-road purpose (i.e. construction and/or material handling or
    motorcycles such as dirt bikes that are put on top of a trailer and taken to a race course) are not
    required to be registered through Pass & Registration.
    3.1.5. Vehicles registered (through Pass and Registration) with AFI/Cover plates must have a valid
    and current registration issued in the name of the owner in the vehicle at all times, as this document
    certifies the tax free temporary import status of the vehicle. Registration fees are due on the day the
    vehicle is registered and will be paid in Euros. The original registration document will be maintained
    on file at Pass and Registration. The vehicle owner will be given a “Registration Substitution Docu-
    ment.”
    3.1.6. At least 30 calendar days prior to registration expiration the vehicle owner must contact Pass
    and Registration. Failure to renew the registration can result in suspension of AFI registration, loss of
AVIANOABI31-204 25 MAY 2007                                                                               9


  gasoline rations and loss of driving privileges. Personnel can contact the Pass & Registration section
  for current information on vehicle registration.
  3.1.7. Owners of AFI/Cover plated vehicles will not lease or rent their vehicles to any other person or

                                TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning.
   4.1.1. The Traffic Circulation Plan for Aviano AB is developed by the NCOIC, Police Service, Civil
   Engineering, the Safety Office and the Logistics Readiness Squadron. This is accomplished through
   the Traffic Safety Coordinating Group and approved by the 31 MSG/CC.
       4.1.1.1. The normal duty day traffic flow is considered moderate due to the layout of Aviano AB.
          4.1.1.1.1. Peak load traffic flow is experienced on the flight line roads leading to the flight line
          gate and roads to Area 1. This heavy flow of traffic is prevalent from 0730-0830 and
          1600-1700 each duty day. Increased traffic flow is experienced during special events con-
          ducted in the flight line area. Any activity over normal requirements causes added traffic flow
          in each area of the base.
          4.1.1.1.2. HN police and the Police Services staff will be notified at least 1 week in advance
          to provide effective control over special events and road maintenance that may affect traffic
          flow.
   4.1.2. Surveys will be conducted by the NCOIC, Police Service, base safety representatives and base
   Civil Engineer to insure uniform and effective traffic planning. Emergency situations such as
   long-term construction projects will necessitate more frequent surveys to address specified situations.
   4.1.3. Judicious use of uniform traffic control signs must be practiced. All road signs and speed limits
   must conform to Italian law. Studies by the Police Service and Base Traffic Engineer will be accom-
   plished to insure uniform and effective traffic planning.
   4.1.4. Off-road vehicles may be utilized on the installation during contingencies, increased threat lev-
   els, emergency situations and when deemed necessary by the 31 SFS/CC.

4.2. Traffic Accident Reporting and Classification.
   4.2.1. A major accident is defined as:
       4.2.1.1. Accident involving fatality or personal injury (evident or claimed).
       4.2.1.2. Accident resulting in damage exceeding $10,000 is considered major for both privately
       owned and government owned vehicles and/or property.
       4.2.1.3. Accident resulting in disabling damage to a GOV/POV (requiring towing). For the pur-
       pose of traffic accident classification, disabling damage is described as such damage rendering the
       vehicle completely inoperable. It does not include damage such as a broken distributor cap, bent
       fender, damaged radiator, flat tires, etc. This type of damage is functional damage and not dis-
       abling.
   4.2.2. A minor vehicle accident is defined as:
       4.2.2.1. Vehicles with non-disabling damage with no injuries or fatalities.
       4.2.2.2. Damage to either privately owned or government owned vehicles or property less than
       $10,000.
16                                                                    AVIANOABI31-204 25 MAY 2007


     4.2.3. Anyone involved in an on-base vehicle accident, major or minor, must immediately report the
     accident to the security forces police desk. Anyone involved in a major accident off-base must imme-
     diately notify the desk sergeant. Personnel involved in minor vehicle accidents off-base will notify the
     security forces police desk within 72 hours of the accident.

4.3. Parking.
     4.3.1. The 31 MSG/CD is the authorizing official for base reserved parking spaces. Justifiable
     requests for reserved spaces will be documented on an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work
     Request, and forwarded to 31 CES/CEO Customer Service along with a diagram of the parking lot
     specifying the desired addition/change to reserved parking. 31 CES/CEO will log all requests, after
     requestor coordinates AF Form 332 with Security Forces, Wing Safety, Fire Department and CES. 31
     CES will then submit all requests to the Traffic Safety Control Group (TSCG) for 31 MSG/CD
     approval. Once approved, 31 CES/CEC will submit to CES/CEO Customer Service for work to be
     executed. When work is completed CES/CEO will notify CES/CECD to update parking maps. When
     parking maps are updated CES/CECD will ensure 31 SFS/S5OSP receives notification of updates to
     the GeoBase maps.
        4.3.1.1. Reserved parking spaces will be assigned in the following priority:
            4.3.1.1.1. Government Vehicles used during duty hours.

   4.3.2. Unit commanders may assign a limited number of parking spaces, not to exceed 10 percent of
   the total area available for personnel parking at each activity (excluding handicapped), to key person-
   nel and personnel with unusual working hours. A maximum of one-half of the 10 percent may be
   assigned to key personnel. Each parking space will be revalidated every 3 years.

4.4. Traffic Violation Reports. Security Forces may issue DD Forms 1408, Armed Forces Traffic
Ticket, to any U.S. military personnel, military family members, NAF and DoD personnel within the con-
fines of Aviano AB. These personnel may also be cited by the Carabinieri, however, Italian Nationals or
NATO military personnel may only be cited by Carabinieri.
   4.4.1. DD Forms 1408 will be disposed of administratively or judiciously IAW AFMAN 31-201, Vol-
   ume 7.
   4.4.2. Once a DD Form 1408 has been issued, the individual receiving the citation will report with the
   pink portion of the violation to his/her first sergeant or commander within 24 hours (72 hours if during
18                                                                   AVIANOABI31-204 25 MAY 2007


     a weekend or holiday). The white and yellow copies of the DD Form 1408 will be forwarded through
     31 SFS/S5OSP to 31 SFS/S5AR.
        4.4.2.1. 31 SFS/S5AR will load the data from the citation into the SFMIS program and a case
        number will be assigned to the citation.
        4.4.2.2. 31 SFS/S5AR establishes an initial 14-day suspense for action and forwards the citation
        to the Unit Commander or Squadron Section Commander. Extensions may be granted on
        case-by-case basis. If response on command action is not received by the due date, dispatch a
        “Notice of Late Suspense” letter (pre-signed by the CSF) giving an additional 7-day suspense. If
        the additional suspense is not met, send a “Notice of Second Late Suspense” to the unit com-
        mander with a courtesy copy to the Group Commander.
        4.4.2.3. IAW AFMAN 31-201, V7, “Since tickets require command action, they must be signed
        by the violator’s unit or squadron section commander. First Sergeants or other personnel may
        complete the administrative process of the ticket; however, the ticket must be signed by the com-
        mander or squadron section commander.” The commander or squadron section commander will
        take appropriate action and forward the original citation back to 31 SFS/S5AR. Appropriate
        action is verbal counseling, letter of counseling, letter of reprimand, Article 15, etc.
        4.4.2.4. 31 SFS/S5AR will review all action taken on citations. Citations returned with inappro-
        priate action will be forwarded to the Chief, Security Forces Administration (31 SFS/S5A). If the
        31 SFS/S5A finds the action taken appropriate, the citation will be filed. If the 31 SFS/S5A finds
        the action inappropriate, the citation will be forwarded to the 31 SFS/CC. If the CSF finds the
        action taken appropriate, the citation will be filed. If the CSF finds the action inappropriate, the
        citation will be forwarded to the 31 MSG/CD for review and action if deemed necessary.
     4.4.3. Persons desiring to appeal traffic citations must do so within 10 duty days following receipt of
     the traffic citation. The individual cited must submit a written appeal through his/her commander.
     DoDDS personnel must appeal through the school’s liaison officer. Dependents of members wishing
     to appeal must do so through their sponsor’s unit commander. The written appeal, along with the com-
     mander’s endorsement (to indicate commander-level involvement), will then be forwarded through 31
     SFS/S5AR to the CSF. Any documentation, statements from witnesses, etc., should be attached to the
     written appeal.
        4.4.3.1. The appeals process is extremely time consuming and imprudent appeals deplete com-
        mand level time; therefore, the following justifications will not be accepted as basis for a sound
        appeal: “No parking available,” “I have always parked there,” “My vehicle was the only one
        cited” and/or “I didn’t know.”
        4.4.3.2. The individual’s squadron commander will evaluate the circumstances surrounding the
        alleged violation, endorse the appeal with the recommendation for action and forward it through
        31 SFS/S5AR to CSF.
        4.4.3.3. The completed package will be forwarded to the 31 SFS/CC for his/her annotation and/or
        recommendation and subsequently to the 31 MSG/CD for final decision. Once the 31 MSG/CD
        has made a decision, SFAR will notify the violator of the final outcome of his/her ticket rebuttal.
     4.4.4. Traffic Violations or License Suspension Reporting.
        4.4.4.1. Military AFI licensed drivers will notify their commander if their (or their dependent’s)
        driving privileges are revoked or suspended by Italian authorities for any reason, within 72 hours
AVIANOABI31-204 25 MAY 2007                                                                               19


       of the incident or 24 hours of returning from pass or leave. Civilian AFI licensed drivers should
       report if their driving privileges are revoked or suspended as well. Failure to do so may jeopardize
       their driving privileges.
       4.4.4.2. In accordance with USAFE Supplement 1 to AFI 31-204, para 4.9.4., military personnel
       arrested or apprehended by host nation police for traffic related offense(s) must report this infor-
       mation to the security forces police desk within 24 hours of the incident. Failure to report this con-
       tact is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ

4.5. Grace Periods for Minor Violations.
Individuals cited for minor vehicle defect(s) by security forces will be given a 72 hour grace period to
have the discrepancy repaired or provide a receipt to demonstrate a part is on order. The violator will
report to the security forces police desk to show the repaired part or receipt for an ordered part within 72
hours. If the violator meets the grace period, the citation will be annotated as a warning by the respective
unit and forwarded to 31 SFS/S5AR. If the individual does not appear or appears and the problem is not
corrected they will be issued a citation for “Operating an Unsafe Vehicle.”

4.6. Traffic Complaints.
Personnel observing traffic violations may make a formal traffic complaint by completing a sworn/
affirmed “Traffic Complaint Form” at the PSD. Persons may also make a telephone complaint to the
police desk, with instructions to report to the PSD within 24 hours to complete a written statement
concerning the complaint. A traffic complaint may also be made electronically utilizing the Aviano
“Safe Highway” intranet web site. The traffic complaint form will be forwarded to the appropriate squad-
ron commander/first sergeant through 31 SFS/SFAR for action. After taking action, the commander/first
sergeant will annotate the action taken on the form and place the form in the violator’s Personal Informa-
tion File (PIF).

4.7. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
   4.7.1. Any lawfully obtained breath, chemical, urine or blood test used to determine an individual’s
   blood alcohol content (BAC) will be accepted; however, the chemical test commonly utilized at Avi-
   ano Air Base is blood extraction by 31st Medical Group laboratory personnel.
   4.7.2. Any person who is deceased, unconscious, or who is otherwise in a condition rendering the per-
   son incapable of refusal, shall be deemed not to have withdrawn the consent provided by AFI 31-204
   and the test or tests may be administered, subject to the provisions of AFI 31-204.
   4.7.3. The blood alcohol standard for Aviano Air Base is .05% g/dl IAW HN law. Persons with a
   blood alcohol concentration of .05% g/dl or higher per volume are considered under the influence and
   are prohibited from operating any motor vehicle.

                           AVIANO AIR BASE VEHICLE TRAFFIC CODE
Introduction: The purpose of the vehicle traffic code is to insure all personnel who operate a government
owned (GOV) or privately owned vehicle (POV) are aware of the rules for operating on Aviano AB. In
addition, some Italian road codes are mentioned to enhance knowledge. It is the operator’s responsibility
to obtain further information in regards to operating a vehicle off Aviano AB.

A2.1. Policy: The operation of a motor vehicle in Italy is a conditional privilege extended by the 31st
Fighter Wing Commander. Individuals given this privilege will meet the standards established in this
instruction.

A2.2. Unlicensed Motor Vehicle Operators: U.S. Forces military members, members of DoD civilian
component, DoD contractors, U.S. AAFES employees, or family members cannot drive, cause or permit
another to drive, an AFI plated private motor vehicle without a valid AFI driver’s license. All personnel
operating a government owned/leased vehicle must have a valid Allied Forces in Italy (AFI) driver’s
license and establish a record (AF Form 2296, Vehicle Operator Information, Part 3) for all vehicle oper-
ators, regardless of motor vehicle type or gross vehicle weight. TDY personnel will comply with the
requirements of AFI 31-204.
     A2.2.1. Local national mechanics or personnel privately employed by Aviano AB personnel to repair
     privately owned vehicles may operate AFI plated vehicles in conjunction with said repairs. This may
     include, but is not limited to, the delivery of the vehicle to the installation. Proper entry procedures
     will be followed.

A2.3. Vehicle Registration: Limited to U.S. Forces Military members, civilian personnel, DoD contractor
personnel and AAFES employees assigned to Aviano AB or supported units.

A2.4. Retired personnel residing in Italy are authorized to maintain their stateside license plates under the
following conditions:
     A2.4.1. The license plate must be current.
     A2.4.2. The individual operating the vehicle must be in possession of a valid stateside driver’s
     license or a valid international driver’s license not issued in Italy.

A2.5. Individuals attempting to enter the installation operating vehicles with an expired driver’s license
or an expired vehicle registration will be denied access onto the installation. If the operator requires entry
onto the installation, the vehicle must be parked off the installation and the operator may enter the instal-
lation as a pedestrian or in another properly registered vehicle, provided the individual is authorized entry.
The driver of the vehicle will be issued a citation, listing the appropriate offense (e.g., expired driver’s
license, expired vehicle registration, etc.) (Non-moving)

A2.6. Vehicle Insurance is the minimum amount of liability required under Italian law as shown by the
insurance policy. Insurance is required to be maintained regardless of the vehicle’s operational status. All
personnel must display an insurance expiration stub issued by their company on their front windshield.
(NOTE: If window tinting obscures the expiration date of insurance, the insurance stub must be relo-
AVIANOABI31-204 25 MAY 2007                                                                              25


cated.) Insurance coverage expires at 2400 on the date of expiration indicated on the insurance docu-
ments. Operators of these types of vehicles must show proof that insurance has been paid upon being
questioned by Security Forces or they will be issued a traffic citation with instructions not to operate the
vehicle, until proof of insurance is obtained. Persons failing to maintain insurance on their AFI Registered
vehicle(s) may have their driving privileges revoked for a period of one year. (Non-moving violation)

A2.7. No person shall unlawfully use or permit the unlawful or fraudulent use of an official driver’s
license, vehicle registration or proof of insurance documents. Persons unlawfully or fraudulently using or
possessing such documents will loose their driving privileges for a period of one year. (Non-moving vio-
lation)

A2.8. Operating an Unsafe Vehicle: No person may operate, cause or permit a motor vehicle to be oper-
ated if the vehicle creates a safety hazard. (Moving violation)

A2.9. Earphones: The wear of earphones/headphones (portable radios, cassettes, CD players, etc.) while
running, jogging, roller blading, walking, or riding a bicycle in a traffic environment on- or off-base is
prohibited. This applies to all individuals operating a motor vehicle, human powered conveyance (i.e.
bicycles, rollerblades, etc.) or pedestrians and joggers. EXCEPTION: Motorcycle helmets with an inter-
com system between the operator and passenger is permitted. (Non-moving violation)

A2.10. Driver’s of POVs and GOVs are prohibited from using hand-held cellular telephones while oper-
ating or in physical control of a motor vehicle. This applies whether on or off the installation. (Moving
violation)

A2.11. Joggers will wear reflective belts or vests while jogging on or off the installation during hours of
darkness or during periods of limited visibility and must run against the flow of traffic. Only exception is
when wearing the official Air Force PT uniform (Non-moving violation)

A2.12. Motorcycle operations.
