AFI11-409 1 DECEMBER 1999                                                                      5


                                           Chapter 2

                       HIGH ALTITUDE AIRDROP PROCEDURES

2.1. General. High altitude personnel and equipment airdrop procedures may be employed
during clandestine operations or in areas where small arms threats preclude conventional low-
altitude deliveries. Airdrops above 3,000 feet AGL are considered high altitude drops. Only
essential personnel who have accomplished appropriate physiological training described in AFI
11-403 are permitted on mission aircraft for airdrops above 10,000 feet MSL.
2.2. High Altitude Operational Requirements for Physiology Technicians. One USAF PT is
required for each 16 personnel on board the aircraft for all unpressurized high altitude missions
conducted at or above 20,000 feet MSL. PT support for high altitude missions below FL200 is
by request to further mitigate risks and is highly recommended. All CONUS requests for PT
support must be made to the USAF HAAMS current operations desk (DSN 779-5248 or 6305).
PACAF requests must be made to Kadena AB, JA (DSN 315-634-1967).
2.3. Oxygen Requirements. A continuous supply of oxygen will be used by all personnel
during unpressurized operations above 10,000 feet MSL. Crewmembers will use established
MAJCOM oxygen mask requirements.
   2.3.1. EXCEPTIONS: Students of the U.S. Army Military Freefall School, Parachutist
   Course (MFFPC) and Military Freefall Jumpmaster Course (MFFJM) may perform
   unpressurized operations between the altitude of 10,000 feet MSL and 13,000 feet MSL for a
   period not to exceed 2 hours without supplemental oxygen with the following safety
   measures in place:
       2.3.1.1. MFFPC Students: A suitably qualified USAF PT will be onboard and
       positioned in the aft portion of the cargo compartment when aircraft is between 10,000 -
       13,000 feet MSL for longer than 30 minutes. Unpressurized flights between these
       altitudes will not exceed 2 hours. The USAF PT will remain on 100% oxygen (or an
       appropriate airmix) throughout the unpressurized portion of the flight above 10,000 feet
       MSL. Under circumstances where an USAF PT is unavailable, a US Army 18 Delta
       Medic or USAF Pararescueman, trained and certified by HQ ACC/SGOP may be used.
       The role of the PT will be to monitor parachutists for signs of impairment resulting from
       hypoxia. If hypoxic impairment is suspected, the parachutist will be returned to the
       forward portion of the cargo compartment and administered 100% oxygen. Once signs
       and symptoms of hypoxia have been resolved, the parachutist may continue training.
       Instructors and jumpmasters will have 100% oxygen available and will breathe from this
       supply whenever practical.
       2.3.1.2. MFFJM Students: There is no requirement for a USAF PT to be onboard for
       unpressurized operations between 10,000 - 13,000 feet MSL, however, the parachutists
       will breathe 100% oxygen for a period of at least 3 minutes, immediately prior to
       jumping if their time between 10,000 - 13,000 feet MSL exceeds 30 minutes.
       Supplemental oxygen will be provided by an oxygen console provided by the Military
       Freefall School.
   2.3.2. All other parachutists may operate without supplemental oxygen during unpressurized
   flights up to 13,000 feet MSL provided time above 10,000 feet MSL does not exceed 30
 6                                                              AFI11-409 1 DECEMBER 1999


     minutes each sortie. Jumpmasters may operate without supplemental oxygen for an
     additional 60 minutes within the 10,000 to 13,000 foot envelope provided their duties during
     this period do not include jumping. For unpressurized flight above 13,000 feet MSL, or
     exceeding the 30-minute envelope between 10,000 and 13,000 feet MSL, the use of an
     individual mask and regulator is required for all jumpers.
     2.3.3. When dropping from 20,000 feet MSL or higher, use prebreathing procedures. When
     the aircraft oxygen system does not provide sufficient oxygen regulators for all personnel,
     approved portable oxygen consoles will be preflighted and installed in the aircraft. The
     consoles will provide enough oxygen regulators for all parachutists and crewmembers not
     accommodated by the normal aircraft oxygen system. The aircraft liquid oxygen converter or
     oxygen cylinders will be full for the first sortie and filled as needed for subsequent sorties.
     2.3.4. For operations conducted above 25,000 feet MSL, MA-1 portable oxygen units
     equipped with A-21 regulators will be provided for each person aboard the aircraft except
     parachutists. All portable units must have a web-carrying strap. NOTE: A waiver to AFI 11-
     202 V3 is required from AF Flt Stds Agency (AFFSA) Oklahoma City, OK for
     unpressurized flights when conducting airdrops 25,000 feet MSL and above.
2.4. Pre-breathing Requirements for Missions at or Above FL 200. All personnel will
prebreathe 100 percent oxygen below 16,000 feet MSL pressure altitude or cabin altitude on any
mission scheduled for an exposure at or above FL 200 for times shown in Table 2.1 Operational
considerations dictate that pre-breathing must be completed before the cabin altitude exceeds
16,000 feet MSL. The aircraft commander, with recommendations from the PT, will determine
the course of action for a break in pre-breathing. All personnel on board the aircraft will remain
on 100 percent oxygen until cabin altitude is below FL 200. After descent below FL 200, all
personnel may remain on 100% oxygen or select supplemental oxygen until 10,000 feet MSL; if
MDS specific requirements dictate more restrictive procedures (100% oxygen), follow MDS
specific requirements. Pre-breathing will be conducted with a personally-fitted oxygen mask
attached to an approved helmet and personal oxygen system. NOTE: Portable oxygen bottles
may not be used for pre-breathing; the quick-don/smoke mask is emergency equipment and is
not approved for pre-breathing or operations conducted at or above FL 200. Purpose of Pre-
breathing. The purpose of pre-breathing (denitrogenation) is to reduce the amount of nitrogen in
the body and therefore reduce the risk of altitude-induced decompression sickness (DCS). Pre-
breathing times are based on scientific research that outlines acceptable DCS risks. Major
factors that enhance the effectiveness of denitrogenation are good hydration and good
circulation.

Maximum Exposure Time per Sortie is when cabin altitude reaches maximum planned
altitude; extended or delayed ascent times expose everyone onboard to greater DCS risk;
missions that require staggered altitude drops will use accumulative times per sortie
information for mission planning.

EXAMPLE – Mission planned drops at FL350, FL299, and FL249; 30 minutes upon
reaching FL350, descend to FL299, spend only 30 minutes (60 accumulative), descend to
FL249, spend only 50 minutes (110 minutes accumulative).

 NOTE 1: Limits based on not exceeding 23% DCS under laboratory conditions (<1%
operational impact such as abort or mission alteration/descent).

NOTE 2: No more than 3 Pre-breather sorties in a 24-hour period unless otherwise restricted.

                               TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

4.1. Training. Training of selected PTs will include the following items: Life Support/Groung
Egress Training (prior to first HAAMS training mission), two orientation flights, familiarization
training with HAAMS equipment (trip kit, prebreathing consoles and bottles and life support
equipment), review the signs, symptoms and treatment of physiological reactions with special
emphasis on decompression sickness reactions, treatment coordination with flight medical
personnel and notification procedures.
   4.1.1. Secondary PT Status. Upon successful completion of item 4.1., the trainee will be
   placed on operational support aeronautical orders and designated a Secondary PT. Each
   Secondary PT will participate in a minimum of five (5) oxygen equipment sorties (additional
   sorties recommended), with two (2) at or above FL180, accompanied by a Primary PT. The
   Secondary PT will progressively assume more responsibilities until capable of handling all
   aspects of a mission. When a Secondary PT has completed all aspects of training and a
   Primary PT certifies training to be complete the Secondary PT acts as Team Leader on a
   subsequent mission and is evaluated by the PT Trainer. Based on the performance of the
   Secondary PT, the PT Trainer then recommends upgrade/not upgrade to the NCOIC,
   HAAMS.
   4.1.2. The PT Trainer will be designated by the NCOIC, HAAMS, in writing, and approved
   by the Commander, Aerospace Physiology Flight. The ACC Command Physiologist, or
   assigned representative(s), is responsible for certifying each Unit PT Trainer upon initial
   appointment and reevaluation if required. Each Unit PT Trainer will, in turn, have the
   responsibility of training and certifying new PTs and reevaluating them every 18 months or
   as required. Evaluations must include the following items:
       4.1.2.1. Pre-mission planning and coordination. Completion of pre-mission checklist.

                                       BRIEFING GUIDE

A2.1. This briefing will be given to all personnel participating in any unpressurized airdrop
operations conducted at or above 18,000 feet MSL, prior to the first sortie flown to or above this
altitude. Additional briefings will be given as required for new personnel not briefed previously
and during extended missions for refresher purposes. PTs should also brief personnel on any
special interest items or problem areas which may impact the mission.
A2.2. All personnel on any flight where cabin altitude will exceed 10,000 MSL will be current
in physiological training. Check for currency by questioning personnel, insuring that any
untrained personnel are not allowed on the mission/sortie. (Individuals current in training should
handcarry AF Form 1274 - Physiological Training)
A2.3. Ensure all personnel have the proper oxygen equipment available. (helmet with mask
or strap-harness assembly, No Quick-Don Assemblies)
