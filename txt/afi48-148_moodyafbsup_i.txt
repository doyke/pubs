                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This instruction addresses the concerns associated with exposure to ionizing
radiation, regardless of source, and seeks to keep exposures as low as reasonably achievable
(ALARA). Specific USAF requirements for USAF Radioisotope Committee regulated and 91(b)
radioactive materials are found in AFIs 40-201 and 91-108, respectively.
1.2. Applicability. The requirements outlined in this instruction apply to all AF, or AF-led,
installations with operations that involve:
     1.2.1. Possession or use of radioactive material (RAM) as specified in AFIs 40-201 and 91-
     108;
     1.2.2. Possession or use of radiation producing devices (hereafter referred to as radiation
     sources), including situations where radiation emissions are incidental to use;
     1.2.3. Use of RAM or radiation devices by contractors, as specified by contract. Note:
     Contractors are solely responsible for the health and safety of their personnel as specified in
     their contract; or
     1.2.4. Avertable general public and occupational doses.
1.3. Objectives of the AF Radiation Protection Program.
     1.3.1. Prevent the occurrence of clinically significant radiation induced deterministic effects
     (i.e., effects for which a threshold dose exists and whose severity is proportional to dose;
     examples include cataracts and acute skin effects). Such shall be accomplished by adherence
     to dose limits.
     1.3.2. Limit the risk of stochastic effects (i.e., effects whose probability of occurrence is
     proportional to dose; examples include cancer and hereditary effects). Such shall be kept to a
     reasonable level in relation to the requirements of the military mission, other societal or

        1.3.5.3. (Added-MOODYAFB) Maintain control of radioactive material and radiation-
        producing devices,
AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                               7


       1.3.5.4. (Added-MOODYAFB) And limit subsequent exposures to occupational
       workers and members of the general public ALARA.
1.4. Types of Radiation Exposure. For the purposes of this instruction, there are four
categories of radiation exposure:
   1.4.1. Occupational exposures are routine exposures incurred as a necessary part of
   supporting the military mission. Common practices that may incur occupational exposures
   include, but are not limited to: industrial radiography, depleted uranium munitions handling,
   research involving nuclear materials or radiation sources, well-logging, diagnostic radiology,
   nuclear medicine, radiation therapy, cosmic or solar radiation during flight, and activities
   involving maintenance of nuclear weapon systems. Furthermore, occupational exposures
   include those due to radon in workplaces;
   1.4.2. Medical exposures are exposures incurred by individuals as part of their own medical
   diagnosis and treatment. Note: Occupational exposure to medical staff or incidental
   radiation exposure to the general public from medical sources are not medical exposures;
   1.4.3. Public exposure encompasses all exposures other than occupational and medical
   exposures. Public exposures of concern, for the purposes of this instruction, include those
   resulting indirectly from AF occupational and medical practices, radon, and from accidents
   or incidents; and
   1.4.4. Incident or contingency type exposures. Such pertains to specific emergency response
   activities to save life or property, humanitarian assistance operations, and military operations
   conducted where national interests may force personnel to incur radiation doses beyond
   occupational limits.
1.5. Practices and Interventions. Activities that may result in radiation exposure can be
broadly divided into two categories: practices and interventions (reference ICRP Publication 60,
1990 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection).
   1.5.1. Radiation Protection Policy for Practices. Routine and controlled operations that incur
   radiation exposure as an unavoidable and unintentional aspect of the activity are considered
   practices. This instruction considers all AF activities that involve the routine use of radiation
   sources or RAM in medicine, research, industry and training to be practices.
       1.5.1.1. Justification: Any proposed activity that may cause exposure to persons should
       yield a sufficient benefit to society or the military to justify the risks incurred by the
       radiation exposure.
       1.5.1.2. Optimization: The magnitude of individual doses and the number of people
       exposed shall be kept ALARA. Economic, military, and social factors shall be taken into
       account.
       1.5.1.3. Dose Limits: The dose to an individual resulting from a combination of all
       relevant practices shall not exceed the limits specified in this instruction.
   1.5.2. Radiation Protection Policy for Interventions. Interventions encompass two broad
   types of activity, operations that seek to reduce existing exposures that are not part of a
   controlled practice and activities conducted to mitigate threats greater than that posed by
   radiation or otherwise conduct operations necessary to achieve higher objectives, including
   those of national security.

    1.5.2.1. Justification: A proposed intervention should do more good than harm. The
    action should take into account the goals of military objectives or humanitarian assistance
    in context with risk management.
    1.5.2.2. Optimization: The form, scale, and duration of the intervention should be
    optimized so the net benefit is maximized and the net detriment is minimized. Again,
    individual doses shall be maintained ALARA.
    1.5.2.3. Dose Guidance: Dose limits do not apply for interventions. Instead, dose
    guidance is utilized in context with surveillance and protection of forces.

     3.3.1.11. Intrinsic radiation safety training shall be given to all nuclear weapons
     specialists (2W2) assigned to nuclear weapons capable units or to units with 91(b)
     materials. Such shall occur within 90 days of assignment with a refresher given every 15
     months thereafter. The IRSO and URSO can expand the scope of this training as
     appropriate (e.g. handlers, loaders, security forces). The content of training is provided at
     the AFMSA Radiation Programs website located on Knowledge Exchange.
  3.3.2. Training Plan: A written training plan shall be developed by the unit, organization, or
  IRSO. The training program shall be reviewed and revised as necessary to reflect changes in
  practices in the workplace.
  3.3.2. (MOODYAFB) Written training plans must be reviewed and approved by the IRSO.
  It is the URSO‘s or PRSO‘s responsibility to submit training plans to the IRSO. If any
  modifications are made to the training plan, the updated plan must be reviewed and approved
  by the IRSO.
  3.3.3. Record keeping. Training programs presented, course curricula, and attendance shall
  be maintained for a period of five (5) years unless otherwise specified. Training shall be
 26                                          AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


   documented on personnel‘s AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, or other AF
   sanctioned training database.
3.4. Radiation Exposure Control.
   3.4.1. Dose Limits. Occupationally exposed personnel shall not exceed dose limits specified
   in Table A5.1.
   3.4.2. Reference Levels. Personnel should not receive a dose in excess of 25% of the
   applicable annual dose limits in a quarter, or 10% of the applicable annual dose limits in a
   month without proper justification and optimization of the procedure.
   3.4.2. (MOODYAFB) The IRSO must perform and document a health risk assessment on
   the aforementioned doses and procedures prior to exposure. The IRSO must also approve the
   aforementioned doses and procedures prior to exposure.
   3.4.3. Investigation Levels. IRSOs, or the RSC where applicable, shall establish a program
   that incorporates acceptable threshold levels for dose. Based upon dosimetry, bioassay, or
   surveillance, IRSOs shall conduct an investigation to determine the causative factors, and
   identify corrective measures, as appropriate. Refer to AFMAN 48-125 for additional
   information.
      3.4.3.1. (Added-MOODYAFB) The investigation action levels for Moody Air Force
      Base are:
          3.4.3.1.1. (Added-MOODYAFB) 62.5 mrem per quarter,
          3.4.3.1.2. (Added-MOODYAFB) 250 mrem per year,
          3.4.3.1.3. (Added-MOODYAFB) 28 mrem per month for pregnant occupational
          radiation workers for the duration of her pregnancy.
      3.4.3.2. (Added-MOODYAFB) The URSO or PRSO will assist in the investigation, if
      necessary.
   3.4.4. Exposure Control. Workers shall use the following techniques, as appropriate, and
   under the judgment and discretion of the IRSO, to ensure dose limits are not exceeded and
   exposures are ALARA (reference NCRP Report No. 127).
      3.4.4.1. Time, Distance, and Shielding: As appropriate, minimize the time around
      sources of external radiation, maximize the distance to radiation sources, and utilize
      radiation shielding between radiation sources and potential exposed personnel to control
      external radiation doses.
          3.4.4.1.1. (Added-MOODYAFB) Personnel may be used to secure the cordon
          around a controlled area (i.e. NDI x-ray procedure at an unshielded facility). It is
          recommended that personnel use radiation detection instruments to monitor exposures
          at the borders of the controlled area.
          3.4.4.1.2. (Added-MOODYAFB) If multiple sources of radiation placed in close
          proximity to one another result in significant exposures, the sources may be placed
          further away from each other in order to decrease the exposure rate. Proper
          precautions IAW the unit radiation protection program will be taken while moving
          the sources apart.
AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                            27


     3.4.4.2. Personal Protective Clothing:
        3.4.4.2.1. Personal protective clothing including lead aprons, glasses and thyroid
        shields to protect from x-rays, plastic face shields and glasses to protect from beta
        particles, and clothing and gloves to protect from contamination shall be used to the
        greatest extent possible.
        3.4.4.2.2. Personal protective clothing is not warranted where its use may result in
        overall more significant internal or external exposure to radiation or other health risks
        more severe than that posed by the potential radiation exposure.
        3.4.4.2.3. Respiratory protection use shall be IAW AFOSH STD 48-137, Respiratory
        Protection Program.
     3.4.4.3. Contamination Control: In the absence of superseding regulatory or advisory
     guidance, a surface is contaminated if either the removable or total radioactivity is above
     the levels in Table A5.2.
        3.4.4.3.1. If a surface cannot be decontaminated promptly to levels below those in
        Table A5.2, the area should be controlled and labeled as contaminated. An
        exemption is granted to routine low-level contamination by short-lived radionuclides
        (half-life less than 120 days) ) used in nuclear medicine departments. Contact
        USAFSAM/OEH for additional guidance.
        3.4.4.3.2. Always prevent or keep radioactive contamination ALARA.
     3.4.4.4. Access Control and Alarm Systems: Provide access control and/or alarm
     systems to prevent access to or warn of a radiation hazard, as appropriate for areas that
     can be classified as high or very high radiation areas under paragraph 3.2.2. For
     additional information, consult USAFSAM/OEH and refer to NCRP Report No. 88.
     3.4.4.5. Radiation Safety Procedures and Work Permits:      Implement, use and
     periodically review radiation safety procedures and radiation work permits, as
     appropriate.
     3.4.4.6. Change of Duty or Curtailment: Individuals who are likely to exceed the dose
     limits of Table A5.1, even with application of the above measures, shall have duties
     modified or curtailed so that limits are not exceeded. Such changes in duty shall remain
     in effect until the individual‘s projected dose will be less than the prescribed limits. This
     situation is most frequently encountered for the pregnant worker who has declared her
     pregnancy. Based on the exposure information and workplace assessment of the IRSO,
     the female worker‘s PCM (if military) or health care provider (if civilian) will determine
     any restrictions to the worker‘s duties involving occupational radiation exposure. The
     following guidelines are prudent for declared pregnant workers:
        3.4.4.6.1. Declared pregnant technologists or providers should be restricted from
        performing fluoroscopic and interventional procedures.
        3.4.4.6.2. Declared pregnant technologists can perform routine radiographic studies,
        portable examinations to include the operating room (except fluoroscopy or C-arm),
        computed tomography, mammography, and radiation therapy.
 28                                           AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


          3.4.4.6.3. Declared Pregnant Nuclear Medicine Technologists may work in imaging
          rooms, but should be restricted from compounding radiopharmaceuticals, dosing
          patients and working in the hot lab.
          3.4.4.6.4. Female nuclear weapons specialists (2W2) who declare pregnancy should
          be restricted from duties requiring contact with or occupancy in rooms where
          Hydrogen-3 (tritium) vapors/oxides are present. If operational requirements of the
          unit make it necessary for pregnant females to work in those areas, then the unit
          commander shall review the exposure potential. The unit commander should consult
          AFSC/SEW, the IRSO, and/or the worker‘s PCM to discuss the potential for exposure
          and risk.
3.5. Radiation Dosimetry, Reporting and Record Keeping.
   3.5.1. Personnel Monitoring Criteria. Individuals who are occupationally exposed to
   ionizing radiation as part of their duties must be provided dosimetry and bioassays as
   described in AFMAN 48-125 when any of the following apply:
      3.5.1.1. Exposures are measured or calculated to exceed 1 mSv (100 mrem) TEDE in a
      year, 2% of a CEDE based ALI or 2% of the occupational limits listed in Table A5.1.
      3.5.1.2. Dosimetry services may be provided to individuals not meeting the above
      criteria. If the type of radiation to which the individual could be exposed is detectable by
      the AF personnel monitoring program and at the discretion of the IRSO, dosimetry
      services may be provided in the following cases:
          3.5.1.2.1. Monitoring would be helpful in demonstrating compliance with ALARA,
          or
          3.5.1.2.2. Monitoring is desirable to evaluate potential exposure conditions to allay
          worker concern.
          3.5.1.2.3. Requested by the individual.
      3.5.1.3. Individuals entering a high or very high radiation area.
      3.5.1.4. Members of the 2W2 career field assigned to a nuclear capable unit except those
      assigned to duties that do not have the potential for INRAD exposure (i.e., administrative
      positions). These individuals shall be monitored for both gamma and neutron dose IAW
      AFI 91-108.
      3.5.1.5. Pregnant occupational radiation workers must be monitored throughout their
      gestational period. Note: Contractors should not be provided dosimetry. The contract,
      IAW 29 CFR 1910.1096, should state the contractor‘s employer will provide dosimetry.
      The AF always has the responsibility to control exposures due to licensed radioactive
      material IAW 10 CFR 20.1201. The IRSO may determine that a contractor can receive
      personal dosimetry if any of the above criterion is met and their employer is not able to
      provide the service.
   3.5.2. Reference Levels. Any dosimeter and/or bioassay result which indicates a dose in
   excess of 25% of the applicable annual dose limit, received for a quarterly monitoring period,
   or 10% of the applicable annual dose limits if monitored monthly, shall be investigated
   within 10 days following discovery. An investigation, which validates excessive exposure
AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                         29


  occurred, shall require a report be submitted to AFMSA/SG3PB and USAFSAM/OEH
  through the MAJCOM BE within 30 days. The report shall include:
     3.5.2.1. Name, SSAN, occupational dosimetry code, and AFSC of the individual(s)
     involved;
     3.5.2.2. Description of circumstances surrounding the exposure;
     3.5.2.3. Estimates of each individual(s) dose equivalent to include a detailed discussion
     of how this value was determined;
     3.5.2.4. Cause of the exposure;
     3.5.2.5. Corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence;
     3.5.2.6. Statement signed by the individual(s) involved either supporting or contesting
     the investigation report;
     3.5.2.7. Results of any medical examinations;
  3.5.3. Overexposures. Any dosimeter and/or bioassay result exceeding the applicable limit
  in Table A5.1 shall be considered an overexposure and immediately investigated.
     3.5.3.1. Notification:
         3.5.3.1.1. When a dosimeter and (or) bioassay indicates an overexposure may have
         occurred, USAFSAM/OEH will immediately notify the IRSO by telephone and
         follow up with an email or faxed letter within three (3) hours.
         3.5.3.1.2. The individual shall be removed, when warranted, from all duties
         involving potential radiation exposure until an investigation of the incident can be
         completed.
     3.5.3.2. Reporting:
         3.5.3.2.1. The IRSO shall investigate suspected overexposures, with a written report
         of the investigation submitted through the MAJCOM BE to USAFSAM/OEH and
         AFMSA/SG3PB within 10 duty days after notification. The written report must
         include those elements required in paragraph 3.5.2.
            3.5.3.2.1.1. (Added-MOODYAFB) The investigation may include a review of
            the current radiation exposure survey, reenactment of the incident, dose
            estimation, additional measurements IAW the ALARA principle, and interviews.
            3.5.3.2.1.2. (Added-MOODYAFB) Although the IRSO is responsible for
            writing and submitting the report, the URSO or PRSO will assist the IRSO with
            the investigation.     This includes coordinating investigation actions (i.e.
            interviews, providing radiation protection program information).
         3.5.3.2.2. The reporting requirements established here do not replace or supersede
         the reporting requirements associated with a nuclear reactor or radiological mishap as
         established in AFI 91-204, Safety Investigation and Reports.
  3.5.4. Record Keeping.

      3.5.4.1. Annual Report of Occupational Exposure. The IRSO shall manage AF Form
      1527-1, Annual Report of Individual Occupational Exposure to Ionizing Radiation, IAW
      AFMAN 48-125.
      3.5.4.2. Cumulative History of Occupational Exposure. Upon written request by the
      individual, IRSO, or other authorized organizations and individuals, USAFSAM/OEH
      shall provide a copy of all AF Forms 1527-2, Cumulative History of Individual
      Occupational Exposure to Ionizing Radiation. All requests other than those made for
      official AF use must have a release signed by the individual for whom the report pertains.
      3.5.4.3. Previous or Concurrent Occupational Dose. The IRSO shall make a reasonable
      effort to collect dosimetry records for individuals having either past or present non-AF
      employment that involve radiation exposure. AF personnel moonlighting in jobs where
      they are monitored for radiation exposure shall make arrangements to routinely (e.g.,
      annually or based on monitoring period) provide these results to the IRSO or URSO. The
      IRSO shall ensure these results are forwarded to USAFSAM/OEH for incorporation in
      the MRER. The individual bears ultimate responsibility for ensuring any non-AF
      dosimetry results become part of the MRER.
   3.5.5. Administrative Doses. Assignment of administrative doses are required for lost or
   damaged dosimeters or for those individuals with exposures other than the purpose for which
   it was intended.       Exposure information from recovered dosimeters shall replace
   administrative dose estimates. Assigned doses must be estimated by the IRSO using the
   procedures in AFMAN 48-125. The IRSO shall ensure the assigned dose replaces the
   administrative dose in MRER within 30 days.
3.6. Monitoring and Surveillance Programs, and Instrumentation.
   3.6.1. Types of Surveys: Surveys shall be conducted in areas where the potential exists for
   exposure to external radiation fields, airborne contamination or surface contamination. Two
   types of surveys are common: routine surveys conducted on a fixed, periodic basis at
   common locations to determine changes or trends in the radiation environment and non-
   routine surveys performed to evaluate new or expected changes in a radiation field.
      3.6.1.1. Routine surveys shall be performed as specified by AFMSA/SG3PB, this
      instruction or based on AFMAN 48-153, Health Risk Assessment.
      3.6.1.2. Non-routine surveys shall be performed by a qualified expert (as defined in the
      Glossary) on any new or substantially modified facility where a radiation source is used,
      or if the characteristics of the radiation source are significantly changed. This includes
      nuclear weapons storage and maintenance facilities, as well as facilities housing 91(b)
      materials. The survey shall determine the efficacy of any installed shielding to protect
      surrounding areas from primary or scattered radiation, as applicable.
      3.6.1.3. In all cases, the survey shall be conducted within 90 calendar days of the facility
      acceptance date or the change in the radiological characteristics of the source. New
      survey measurements must be taken after any modification of the facility impacting the
      shielding or RAM control, replacement or change of the radiation source, and/or a
      significant change in practice or the uses of the radiation source.
AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                             31

   3.6.2. Instrumentation: Instrumentation used to perform surveys shall be appropriate to the
   type of radiation(s) and energy of radiation(s) being detected. IRSOs shall consult with
   USAFSAM/OEH on instrumentation requirements prior to performing intrinsic radiation,
   atmospheric radiation, high energy (>13 MeV) accelerator surveys or other mixed radiation
   environments.
       3.6.2.1. Instrumentation shall be calibrated annually, or at a frequency specified in the
       applicable USAF RAM Permit or TO, using National Institute of Standards and
       Technology (NIST) traceable radiation sources.
       3.6.2.2. Records of instrument calibration shall be maintained by the installation,
       organization or URSO, as appropriate, for three (3) years.
       3.6.2.3. Instrument performance shall be checked before each use, IAW manufacturer's
       recommendations, as applicable.
   3.6.3. Record keeping.
       3.6.3.1. Survey results should be maintained for a period of no less than three years, or as
       specified in the applicable AF RAM permit, TO or AF Files Disposition Instruction,
       whichever is most stringent. Specific record keeping requirements for radiation
       protection programs can be found in AFI 40-201, Attachment 7
       3.6.3.2. Survey results shall include: a description or drawing of each measurement
       location; measured dose or contamination levels at each location; the type, model
       number, serial number, and calibration date of the instrument; name of individual
       performing the survey, date and time of the survey and applicable comments.
3.7. Radioactive Waste Management.
   3.7.1. Radioactive Waste Minimization: Waste generation shall be minimized, or preferably
   prevented at the source. Unavoidable wastes should be recycled, when feasible, or be
   reduced in volume and treated, when feasible, to render it less hazardous.

       RADIATION PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICAL USES OF
                             RADIATION

4.1. Introduction.
   4.1.1. This chapter applies to all USAF Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) worldwide
   (i.e., CONUS, OCONUS, deployed AF locations, and Joint DOD installations where the AF
   is the lead service) that acquire, possess, install, calibrate, maintain, evaluate, use or dispose
   of sources of radiation used for diagnosis, therapy or for medical research. Any exceptions to
   this policy must be approved by the Associate Corp Chief for Bioenvironmental Engineering
   in consultation with the AF/SG Consultant for Medical Physics.
       4.1.1.1. For Joint DOD or Joint AF-Veterans Affairs MTFs, the Memorandum of
       Agreement (MOA) shall include specific instructions and/or guidance regarding the
       scope of medical physics support and required services. Coordination of all proposed
       MOAs must be coordinated through the Associate Corps Chief for Bioenvironmental
       Engineering in consultation with the AF/SG Consultant for Medical Physics. If the AF is
       the lead service, coordination through the designated Regional Consulting Medical
       Physics Office (reference Attachment 6) is also required.
   4.1.2. This chapter describes radiation protection requirements that are applicable to medical
   practices to ensure patient, practitioner and public radiation doses are ALARA, while
   obtaining clinical objectives. Responsibility for complying with the requirements in this
   chapter rests with the MTF commander or duly appointed individual(s) who possess
   appropriate training, skills, credentials, and resources to ensure compliance.
4.2. Responsibilities.
   4.2.1. MTF Commander.
       4.2.1.1. If the MTF maintains qualified medical physicists (reference paragraph 4.3.3):
           4.2.1.1.1. The MTF shall ensure that the qualified organizational medical physicists

       after any servicing that may have affected calibration. A record of each dosimetry
       system calibration, intercomparison, and comparison shall be maintained for 36 months.
       4.4.3.3. Each facility shall maintain two (2) independent dosimetry systems or
       alternatively have a means of obtaining an independent determination of beam calibration
       on an annual basis using an ADCL calibrated electrometer and ionization chamber(s) not
       normally used by the facility for routine calibration.
4.5. General Requirements in the Clinical Use of X-Ray, Electron Beam and Gamma-Ray
Radiation. As a general principle, the dose to the patient shall be kept to a minimum and
consistent with clinical objectives. Each MTF shall have and implement written operating and
safety procedures. These procedures, including any restrictions of the operating technique
required for the safe operation of the particular system, shall be made available to each
individual operating a radiation producing machine. These procedures shall be reviewed
annually and approved by the appropriate clinic chief, MTF radiation safety office, or regional
consulting medical physics office. Specific requirements shall include, but are not limited to:
   4.5.1. The useful beam shall be limited to the smallest area practical and consistent with the
   objectives of the radiological examination or treatment.
   4.5.2. The tube potential, filtration and source-to-skin distance (SSD) employed in medical
   diagnostic procedures should be as large as practical, consistent with study objectives.
       4.5.2.1. Special care should be taken to ensure that adequate and proper filtration is used
       for all diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
       4.5.2.2. The operator should use the maximum SSD consistent with medical
       requirements of the procedure. For diagnostic procedures, other than dental procedures,
       distances less than 30 cm should not be used. Note: For new systems, one must be aware
       of variable source to image distance options which could result in excessive wear on the
       x-ray tube.
   4.5.3. Protection of the conceptus during radiological examination or treatment of women
   known to be pregnant shall be given special consideration, as described in paragraph 4.6.

   likely to be exposed to a useful beam provided such shielding does not interfere with clinical
   diagnostic information or proper treatment. In addition:
       4.5.5.1. Gonadal shielding using at least 0.5 mm lead equivalence shall be used
       whenever potentially procreative individuals are likely to receive direct gonadal radiation
       in an exam or treatment or the primary beam is within 2.5 cm of the gonadal area.
       4.5.5.2. Shielding of breasts for scoliosis radiographs should be used due to the
       sensitivity of breast tissue in young women and the number of films likely to be taken in
       a lifetime. The shield must be placed between the source of x-rays and the patient. If
       there is no shield available, a posterior-anterior (PA) view should be used.
44                                           AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


     4.5.5.3. The lens of the eye should be shielded with a least 2 mm lead equivalence during
     tomographic procedures that include the eye in the useful beam (Not required for PA
     projections).
  4.5.6. Fluoroscopy, with the exception of microampere systems used in orthopedics, shall
  not be used as a substitute for radiography, but should be reserved for the study of dynamics,
  spatial relationships, and guidance in spot film recording of critical detail and simulation in
  radiation therapy. Last image hold should be utilized whenever possible. System users shall
  understand the various dose mode options in multiple dose mode systems, and review those
  features annually in reference to exposure output data provided by the regional consulting
  medical physics office.
  4.5.7. Intensifying screens, computed radiography imaging plates, digital imaging detectors,
  and other image recording devices shall be tested annually for uniform response and artifact
  evaluation. Defects identified shall be reviewed by the interpreting radiologist or medical
  physicist for corrective action. Imaging screens/plates/detectors shall be replaced as deemed
  necessary by the interpreting radiologist or medical physicist.
  4.5.8. No person should routinely hold patients during diagnostic examinations.
     4.5.8.1. If a patient must be held in position, then mechanical supports or immobilization
     aids must be used when feasible.
     4.5.8.2. If mechanical devices cannot be used; the individual selected to hold the patient
     should be a willing adult (21 years of age or older) relative who is not an occupational
     radiation worker. If no willing adult family member is available, the next best option is to
     have a properly shielded non radiation safety worker position the patient. Only if this is
     not feasible, a monitored occupational radiation worker may hold the patient. Diagnostic
     Imaging (4RXXX) technologists may hold the patient when consistent with ALARA
     objectives as determined by the RSO.
     4.5.8.3. Pregnant women or persons under 18 years of age should not be permitted to
     hold patients.
     4.5.8.4. If a patient must be held by someone, the individual holding the patient shall be
     protected with appropriate shielding devices such as gloves and aprons. Positioning
     should be arranged so that no part of the holder's torso is struck by the useful beam, and
     that the holder's body is as far as possible from the useful beam.
  4.5.9. Only individuals whose presence is necessary shall be in diagnostic x-ray, fluoroscopy
  or low-energy (< 150 kV) radiotherapy rooms during exposures. These personnel shall be
  protected with appropriate shielding for the specific situation (e.g., leaded aprons, leaded
  gloves and/or portable shields).
  4.5.10. Individuals, other than the patient, shall not be in linear accelerator vaults or high
  dose rate brachytherapy vaults during machine use.
  4.5.11. Protective devices, including lead aprons, gloves, and shields (including those items
  at dental, cardio-lab, angiography and operating rooms) shall be stored properly and checked
  initially and annually for defects such as holes, cracks, and tears. These checks may be
  performed by the flight/element personnel by visual means (obvious rips or tears) for dental
  and medical clinics. Additional checks of defects may be performed using x-ray imaging
AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                             45


   (fluoroscopy recommended). Each MTF must develop proper procedures for disposal of
   rejected lead protective material.
   4.5.12. The machine operator shall stand behind a barrier, if provided, and shall observe the
   patient during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The operator shall be able to see, speak
   to, and hear the patient.
   4.5.13. Radiographic film shall not be used beyond its expiration date. Unprocessed film
   shall be protected by appropriate shielding and should not be exposed to more than 0.002
   mGy (0.2 mrad) prior to use.
4.6. Exposure of Fertile Women to Radiation for Treatment or Diagnosis. Due to the
increased radiation exposure risks to the conceptus (including all embryonic and fetal
development stages), the possibility of pregnancy shall be addressed for any woman of
reproductive capacity when considering any nuclear medicine procedure and/or any radiographic
examination involving the lower abdomen.
   4.6.1. Before any medical procedure involving radiation is performed, the patient shall be
   asked if she is pregnant; if the patient is pregnant or there is a possibility that she could be
   pregnant, the attending physician shall be immediately informed. Before any therapeutic
   procedure, a pregnancy test shall be given to all fertile women no sooner than 48 hours
   preceding the treatment. Any inconclusive pregnancy test or statement made by the patient as
   to the potential of being pregnant should delay treatment until a conclusive negative
   pregnancy test can be obtained. Note: A pregnancy test cannot detect the presence of an
   embryo until several days post implantation.
   4.6.2. Ideally elective abdominal/pelvic examination of a woman of childbearing age should
   be performed during the first 14 days following the onset of menses to minimize the
   possibility of irradiation during pregnancy. In practice, the timeliness of medical needs
   should be the primary consideration in deciding the timing of an examination.
   4.6.3. Radiographic and nuclear medicine examination and/or waiting rooms, other than
   those used exclusively for dentistry, shall be posted with appropriate signs alerting patients
   that if they may be pregnant to notify the physician or technologist before the examination.
   4.6.4. In the event of a conceptus exposure (i.e., the fetus or embryo is exposed to radiation)
   the responsible clinic shall:
       4.6.4.1. Have a qualified medical physicist (Attachment 6) determine by measurement
       or modeling the estimated dose to the conceptus. These calculations shall be reported to
       the patient‘s physician who will interpret them to the patient.
       4.6.4.2. Adhere to the requirements of paragraph 4.14.
4.7. Quality Control (QC). A QC program provides adequate confidence that a diagnostic x-
ray or nuclear medicine clinic will produce consistently high quality images with minimum dose
to the patients and medical staff. Similarly, a radiation therapy QC program assists in assuring
treatments are performed with the optimum dose to tumor tissues and minimal dose to healthy
tissue of the patient with the least possible exposure to medical staff.

       operation used during the clinical protocol.
       4.8.1.2. The radiation exposure rate used in fluoroscopy should be as low as is consistent
       with fluoroscopic requirements and not exceed those listed in 10 CFR 1020.32 at the
       point where the beam enters the patient.
       4.8.1.3. The total exposure time, dose area product (if available), cumulative absorbed
       dose (if available), physician, procedure type, and specific unit should be recorded in the
       patient's medical record and a log maintained for each unit for general fluoroscopy,
       angiography, and cardiac catheterization lab. This data should be monitored by a
       radiologist or qualified user, medical physicist, or technologist on a monthly or quarterly
       basis to identify equipment, procedural, or personnel issues resulting in higher than
       average exposures (i.e., average exposure values are listed in AAPM Report No. 58,
       Managing the Use of Fluoroscopy in Medical Institutions).
       4.8.1.4. Tight collimation, short irradiation times, and minimal use of magnification shall

     bioenvironmental engineer, as defined in the Glossary) shall specify and recommend all
     protective shielding for the specific modality.
     4.8.1.7. Leaded gloves of at least 0.25 mm lead equivalence should be worn by
     physicians during near beam work. The physician shall not place hands in the direct
     beam, even with lead glove protection. If not using gloves, a ring dosimeter must be
     worn. It is recommended that ring dosimeters be worn when using lead gloves (i.e., ring
     dosimeter worn on finger inside of leaded glove).
     4.8.1.8. Eye protection in the form of leaded glass shields or leaded (prescription) eye
     glasses should be used for clinicians with high fluoroscopic workloads, such as those

      4.8.3.3. Avoidance of serious x-ray-induced skin injuries to patients during
      fluoroscopically-guided procedures. (reference Burlington B.D., FDA Public Health
      Advisory: Avoidance of Serious X-Ray-Induced Skin Injuries to Patients During
      Fluoroscopically-Guided Procedures). To avoid skin doses which may result in acute
      injury, clinics performing fluoroscopically guided procedures shall:
          4.8.3.3.1. Establish and document standard operating procedures and clinical
          protocols for each specific type of interventional procedure performed. The protocols
          should address all aspects of the procedure, such as patient selection, normal conduct
          of the procedure, actions in response to complications and consideration of limits on
          fluoroscopy exposure time. Protocols should also include a mechanism to report
          estimated patient exposure to the patient‘s primary care physician for follow-up of
          lengthy procedures that might result in delayed effects.
          4.8.3.3.2. Assess the impact of each procedure's protocol for the potential of
          radiation injury to the patient.
          4.8.3.3.3. Modify the protocol, as appropriate; to minimize the cumulative absorbed
          dose to any irradiated area of the skin to accomplish the clinical tasks, and to avoid
          cumulative doses that would induce unacceptable adverse effects. Use equipment that
          aids in minimizing absorbed dose.
          4.8.3.3.4. Obtain assistance from a qualified diagnostic medical physicist as needed,
          in implementing these protocols to ensure the clinical image quality/dose objectives
          of the procedure are not adversely affected.
          4.8.3.3.5. Report, IAW AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations; the Safe Medical
          Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA); and 21 CFR Parts 803 to 807a, any fluoroscopically
          induced injuries, following the procedures established by the facility for such
          mandatory reporting. Practitioners who become aware of any medical device related
          adverse event or malfunction should report to their Medical Device User Facility
          Reporting individual. Note: Radiation induced injuries from fluoroscopy are not
          immediately apparent. Other than the mildest symptoms, such as transient erythema,
          the effects of the radiation may not appear until weeks following exposure. Providers
          performing these procedures may not be in direct contact with the patients following
          the procedure and may not observe the symptoms when they occur. Cumulative dose
          information therefore should be recorded in the patient‘s medical record and on the
          appropriate form in the AF Form 2100A series. Patients should be informed via
          consent form SF 522, Request for Administration of Anesthesia and for Performance
          of Operations and Other Procedures, of potential injuries and advised to report signs
          and/or symptoms of radiation induced injury to their attending physician.

AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                             57


  4.13.1. An AF radiation therapy clinic shall report all radiation therapy medical events as
  specified in paragraphs 4.13.3 and 4.13.4. A radiation therapy medical event is defined as
  an adverse event which places the patient at risk of injury (except for an event that results
  from patient intervention) in which the administration of machine produced radiation results
  in:
     4.13.1.1. A dose that exceeds 0.05 Sv (5 rem) effective dose equivalent, 0.5 Sv (50 rem)
     to an organ or tissue, or 0.5 Sv (50 rem) shallow dose equivalent to the skin, and any of
     the following:
         4.13.1.1.1. The total dose delivered differs from the prescribed dose by 10% or more;
         4.13.1.1.2. The fractionated dose delivered exceeds the prescribed dose, for a single
         fraction, by 50% or more;
         4.13.1.1.3. An administration of a dose or dosage to the wrong individual;
         4.13.1.1.4. An administration of a dose or dosage delivered by the wrong mode of
         treatment; or
         4.13.1.1.5. A geographic miss causing a dose to an organ or tissue other than the
         treatment site that exceeds 50% or more of the prescribed fraction size.
  4.13.2. The clinic shall report any event resulting from intervention of a patient or human
  research subject in which the administration of machine produced radiation results or will
  result in an unintended permanent functional damage to an organ or a physiological system,
  as determined by a physician.
  4.13.3. The clinic shall notify the responsible MTF‘s SGH, or their designee, no later than
  the next calendar day after discovery of the medical event. The SGH will then determine,
  based upon consultation with the responsible radiation oncologist, radiation therapy
  physicist, and referring physician or clinic, whether or not the event involves risk of
  permanent injury to the patient or subject. If such risk is determined to be present, the event
  becomes a reportable medical event. The clinic will then telephonically report the medical
  event to the AFMSA/SG3PB (Radiation Program) within seven (7) calendar days.
  4.13.4. The clinic shall submit a written report to AFMSA/SG3PB (Radiation Health)
  through the responsible MAJCOM/SGP within 15 calendar days after discovery of the
  medical event.
     4.13.4.1. The written report must include:
         4.13.4.1.1. The clinic‘s organization and base;
         4.13.4.1.2. The name and unit of the prescribing physician, Chief of Radiation
         Oncology, and radiation therapy medical physicist;

      4.13.5.1. The clinic shall notify the referring physician, or, if unavailable, the
      responsible referring clinic chief within 24 hours.
      4.13.5.2. The individual affected by the medical event shall also be notified no later than
      24 hours after its discovery, unless the referring physician or clinic chief elects to
      personally inform the individual or that, based on medical judgment, telling the
      individual would be harmful.
      4.13.5.3. The clinic is not required to notify the individual without first consulting the
      referring physician. However, if the referring physician or the affected individual cannot
      be reached within 24 hours, the clinic shall notify the individual as soon as possible
      thereafter.
      4.13.5.4. The clinic may not delay any appropriate medical care for the individual,
      including any necessary remedial care as a result of the medical event, because of a delay
      in notification. Therefore to meet the requirements of this section, notification may be
      made that individual‘s responsible relative or guardian.
   4.13.6. If the individual was notified under paragraph 4.13.5 of this section, the clinic shall
   also provide a written report to the individual within 15 days after discovery of the medical
   event. A clinic may send either:

                                           Chapter 5

                      RADIATION PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC

5.1. General. Public dose is the dose received by a member of the public from exposure to
radiation or radioactive material used in AF practices and radon. Public dose does not include
occupational dose or doses from other background radiation sources or any medical
administration the individual has received.
5.2. Control of Public Exposures from AF Practices. Administrative and engineering
controls, policies, or procedures are implemented to control public dose from AF practices. The
following requirements are specified for all AF practices that may result in public exposure:
   5.2.1. All practices shall be conducted to minimize public dose considering the state of
   technology, economics of improvements in relation to the state of technology, the economics
   of improvements in relation to benefits to the public health and safety, and other societal and
   socioeconomic considerations.
   5.2.2. Members of the public shall not occupy vehicles during cargo or vehicle inspections
   that use scanning systems employing radiation.
   5.2.3. All practices shall be conducted in such a manner that a member of the public will not
   exceed the applicable dose limits specified in Table A5.1. For non-medical practices, the
   IRSO shall be responsible for the determination, either by measurement or calculation that
   this dose is not exceeded, and maintain this record permanently. For medical practices, the
   PRSO, responsible medical physicist, health physicist or BE, as appropriate, shall be
   responsible for this determination.
   5.2.4. Unrestricted areas. The dose in any unrestricted area resulting from AF controlled
   radiation sources will not exceed 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) in any one hour, or 1 mSv (100 mrem)
   in a year, occupancy and use factors being taken into account. This requirement does not
   apply to those excepted by 10 CFR 35.75. The IRSO shall be responsible for the assessment,
   either by measurement or calculation, that these dose rates are not exceeded and maintain this
   record permanently.
   5.2.4. (MOODYAFB) Although the area may be considered an unrestricted area, doses to
   the general public and occupational workers must remain ALARA, regardless of the dose
   limits and dose rate limits.
   5.2.5. Control of Visitors.
       5.2.5.1. Visitors to any restricted area must be accompanied by persons knowledgeable
       about the protection and safety measures in the area.
       5.2.5.2. Visitors must be provided adequate information and instruction before they enter
       a restricted area to ensure appropriate protection of the visitors and of other personnel in
       the area.
       5.2.5.3. Visitors entering defined "Radiation Areas" or "High Radiation Areas" or that
       could incur a deep dose equivalent in excess of 0.10 mSv (10 mrem) shall be provided
       personal monitoring devices. A log of all such monitored individuals shall be maintained
       and the results communicated to the individual.
AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                            61


   5.2.6. Public Overexposures. If an individual member of the public may have received a
   dose in excess of the applicable limit in Table A5.1, that dose and practice shall be
   immediately investigated by the IRSO. If appropriate, the unit, organization or IRSO should
   implement, with commander‘s approval, protective actions to mitigate further exposures.
       5.2.6.1. Notification: When a member of the public may have received a dose above the
       applicable limits in Table A5.1, the IRSO shall be contacted immediately. The IRSO
       shall contact USAFSAM/OEH to validate the assessment of dose. If the dose is
       validated, the IRSO should then notify, within three (3) hours, the MAJCOM BE and
       AFMSA/SG3PB.
       5.2.6.2. Reporting: The IRSO, with the assistance of USAFSAM/OEH, shall investigate
       suspected exposures above the limits specified in Table A5.1, with a written report of the
       investigation submitted through the MAJCOM BE to AFMSA/SG3PB within seven (7)
       days of notification. The written report must include:
           5.2.6.2.1. The organization‘s name and office symbol where the exposure occurred;
           5.2.6.2.2. A brief description of the event;
           5.2.6.2.3. A description of the person(s) exposed and their estimated dose equivalent;
           5.2.6.2.4. Why the event occurred; and
           5.2.6.2.5. What actions, if any, have been taken or are planned to prevent recurrence.
5.3. Protection of the Public from Avertable Doses. This section specifies requirements to
protect members of the public from two specific sources of radiation: public exposures resulting
from radon in AF controlled structures and public exposures that may occur from an incident or
accident involving radioactive materials. For each case, interventions may be necessary to
protect the public. The radon exposure at which an intervention is merited is referred to as a
remedial action level. For incidents or accidents, a protective action or intervention is merited
when dose can be avoided by conducting the intervention or implementing the protective action.
   5.3.1. Radon Exposure: The following requirements are specified to address those facilities
   and operating locations not originally assessed in the AF Radon Assessment and Mitigation
   Program of 1987 (USAF OEHL Report 87-132RZ0111KRD, The Bioenvironmental
   Engineer’s Primer to the Air Force Radon Assessment and Mitigation Program (RAMP)).
   These facilities or operating locations are medium or high risk if any of the screening
   measurements identified at least one area with radon concentration greater than 4 pCi/L
   (EPA medium risk guideline), or 20 pCi/L (EPA high risk guideline).
       5.3.1.1. Newly constructed or acquired structures on installations designated as medium
       and/or high risk: Any new enclosed structure for installations that underwent a detailed
       assessment as part of the 1987 RAMP shall be assessed by the IRSO for exposure to
       radon progeny, with the exception of: hangars, maintenance bays, dedicated storage
       facilities, structures occupied less than four hours per day, temporary facilities, and
       elevated structures with unobstructed air flows underneath.
           5.3.1.1.1. New structures should not be tested for one year after construction to allow
           for foundation settling. Contact USAFSAM for designing an appropriate sampling
           plan.
62                                           AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


         5.3.1.1.2. Monitoring shall be performed using a long term monitor (e.g., alpha track
         detector or long-term electret) deployed in the lowest occupied location of the
         structure.
         5.3.1.1.3. Evaluation.
             5.3.1.1.3.1. No further action is required for structures identified with annual
             average radon concentrations of less than 4 pCi/L.
             5.3.1.1.3.2. Structures that exceed 4 pCi/L shall be remediated by CE to levels
             ALARA, but shall result in exposures less than 4 pCi/L. The remediation
             schedule should adhere to the following schedule: > 20 pCi/L within one year, 4
             - 20 pCi/L, within 1-3 years.
             5.3.1.1.3.3. (Added-MOODYAFB) Moody Air Force Base was classified as
             low risk by the RAMP (i.e. all samples from buildings built during or before 1987
             had radon concentrations less than 4 pCi/L.
         5.3.1.1.4. Remediated structures shall be reassessed by the IRSO for ambient radon
         concentrations no less than two weeks and no greater than six months post
         remediation to validate the efficacy of the remedial action. A combination of short-
         term and long-term monitoring should be conducted to assure acceptable radon levels
         have been achieved. If remediation is unsuccessful, maintain exposure limits at
         ALARA until further remediation actions are implemented.
     5.3.1.2. New installations or installations never previously assessed: For all new,
     permanent operating locations, a random sampling of the structures shall be assessed for
     radon. USAFSAM shall be consulted on designing an appropriate sampling program.
     Any installation found to have a single structure with concentrations greater than 4 pCi/L
     shall undergo a detailed assessment.
     5.3.1.3. CE should design and construct new structures on medium and high risk bases
     with radon resistant features.
  5.3.2. Uncontrolled Exposures Resulting from Radiological Incidents and Accidents.
  Members of the public that are under the protection of an installation commander shall be
  protected during emergency situations from exposure to radiation to the greatest extent
  possible. Specific protective measures that can be implemented are listed in Attachment 7.
  The decision to invoke a protective action, i.e., sheltering or evacuation, should be based on
  whether the action will allow the population to avert (or avoid) the recommended threshold
  dose provided with a given action or intervention.

    RADIATION PROTECTION OF AF PERSONNEL DURING INTERVENTIONS

6.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for protecting AF personnel conducting actions in
uncontrolled radiation environments. These environments may include deployed locations
where known or suspected nuclear or radiological hazards exist and radiological environments
created by hostile action or industrial, medical, nuclear incident or accident. Interventions are
specific actions performed in these environments to mitigate the source(s) of exposure, to save
life or limb, protect high value assets, or achieve higher objectives that may merit personnel
incur risks greater than those permitted for practices. This section also applies to nuclear capable
units and units with 91(b) material. The following summarizes the radiation protection
considerations described in Joint Publication, Operations in Chemical, Biological, Radiological,
and Nuclear (CBRN) Environments, Aug 2008. For specific guidance refer to JP 3-11;
USACHPPM TG 244, The Medical CBRN Battlebook, Oct 2008; and/or AFRRI‘s Medical
Management of Radiological Casualties, Apr 2003.
6.2. Radiation Protection Principles and Guidance for Interventions.
   6.2.1. There are three basic principles of ionizing radiation protection used to manage the
   risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure.
       6.2.1.1. Justification. No unnecessary exposure should be undertaken.
       6.2.1.2. Optimization. The level of individual doses, number of people exposed and
       likelihood of incurring exposure should be kept ALARA.
       6.2.1.3. Limitation. The dose to an individual shall be limited according to appropriate
       DOD guidance.
   6.2.2. Applying radiation protection principles should not introduce a higher level or more
   severe risk to the unit or mission. Complete risk management requires:
       6.2.2.1. Information. Personnel must assess risk using an all hazards approach using all
       available information such as measurements, visual observations, and modeling.
           6.2.2.1.1. (Added-MOODYAFB) During the all-hazards response, the IRSO is
           responsible for conducting a health risk assessment IAW AFMAN 48-153.
           6.2.2.1.2. (Added-MOODYAFB) The health risk must be delivered within the
           operational context, especially if military operations take place (i.e. airlift into a
           contaminated area, recovery of classified material). Recommendations to control
           hazards, limit and reduce contamination, and maintain exposures ALARA will be
           analyzed and communicated.
       6.2.2.2. Justification. Consideration of threshold and random health consequences of
       radiation exposure needs to be considered. Unnecessary risks to health should not be
       accepted.
       6.2.2.3. Optimization. To minimize the potential effects of exposure, intervention
       planning should involve efforts to reduce the time in a radiation area, maintaining the
 64                                            AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


      maximum distance possible from radiation sources, and using shields between exposed
      personnel and radiation sources to keep radiation exposures ALARA.
   6.2.3. Dose guidance should be developed for a given intervention. Dose limits do not apply
   for interventions. Instead, the operational exposure guidance (OEG) is applicable. The
   commander‘s decision to allow this exposure should be based on the Radiation Exposure
   Status (RES) category found in JP 3-11 and made in the context of the situation and balance
   the anticipated benefit with both short and long-term health risks the exposure may cause.
   The exposure will vary depending on whether the mission is critical, priority, or routine and
   the severity of the radiological threat (catastrophic, critical, marginal, or negligible). An OEG
   should be set for each mission with potential for exposure, for decontamination of personnel
   or equipment, or for immediate or operational decontamination.
      6.2.3.1. Dose due to the ingestion or inhalation of RAM cannot be accurately measured
      in the field but can be estimated for operational purposes. Depending on the type of
      RAM and its dispersed form, the internal dose may be much larger than the external dose
      for a given operation.
      6.2.3.2. Medical authorities should recommend personal protective equipment (PPE),
      including respiratory protection. Commanders will dictate PPE use based on operational
      risk analysis. Operational risk analysis should include the detriment posed by reduced
      vision, hearing, mobility, and tactile sensation; increased heat and psychological stress;
      increased time to complete tasks, and decreased task accuracy when wearing PPE. These
      in turn can lead to increases in external radiation exposures and the magnitude of other
      mission risks.
   6.2.4. Voluntary Participation. Where practical, interventions predicted to result in
   significant exposures (those greater than practice limits) should make use of volunteers to the
   greatest extent possible.
      6.2.4.1. Experienced volunteers who do not plan on having more children may be
      preferred. The concern over temporary/permanent sterility is reduced. Also, experienced
      workers typically can complete an operation in a more timley manner, reducing their
      dose.
   6.2.5. Excluded Populations. Operational personnel that are, or may be pregnant, or that are
   less than 18 years of age shall not conduct interventions.
6.3. Allowable Contamination Levels.
   6.3.1. Recommended contamination levels for clothing and equipment or skin should be
   managed to levels that are ALARA using methods found in AFMAN 44-161(l), AFJMAN
   44-151, and NUREG 1575 (most current version). In some operational environments where
   thorough decontamination options may be unavailable, skin contamination should not exceed
   the levels specified in NATO Standardization Agreement 2473.
   6.3.2. Operational implementation of these contamination standards should follow
   procedures in Allied Engineering Publication-49, NATO Handbook for Sampling and
   Identification of Radiological Agents (SIRA), Volume 1 (Operational) and 2 (Forensic), or
   guidance provided by the assigned radiation protection personnel.
AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                              65


6.4. Training and Risk Communication. Personnel participating in an intervention shall be
informed of the potential health risks their radiation exposure may result in, and trained in the
necessary principles and procedures to minimize their exposure consistent with paragraph 3.3
of this instruction. Depending on the nature of the intervention, training should be provided by
medical radiation protection personnel.
6.5. Monitoring During Interventions. Implementing operational risk management and
supporting operational dose guidance requires the ability to estimate or measure individual
doses. This is optimally done through the use of radiation survey instruments, environmental
sampling, personnel dosimeters, and/or bioassays.
   6.5.1. Personnel deployed in known or potential radiation environments shall be provided
   individual dosimeters if the potential to exceed 1 mSv (100 mrem) exists.
   6.5.2. Personnel entering contaminated environments should be afforded in-vitro or in-vivo
   bioassays to determine the extent of internal exposures if internal contamination is suspected.
   6.5.3. If individual dosimetry or prompt bioassay measurements are not available, efforts
   will be made to estimate individual doses through group dosimetry, radiation survey,
   environmental monitoring data, modeling, dose reconstructions, or other methods consistent
   with currently accepted scientific practice.
   6.5.4. Systematic, individual dose records for external and internal exposures shall be
   maintained indefinitely, even if the dosimeter or bioassay result is zero. Results shall be
   maintained in the AF MRER, and the individual‘s medical record.
       6.5.4.1. For units for which group dosimetry is used, doses as measured shall be
       averaged and applied to the entire group for the purposes of applying the Commanders
       OEG. The RSO supporting the unit shall track unit doses, determine the acceptability of
       the unit dose to reflect individual doses, and forward this dose information for each unit
       member for inclusion in the MRER and the individuals medical records.
       6.5.4.2. Classification of exposure data may prevent its inclusion in the MRER. Medical
       authorities for the command conducting classified operations shall maintain and be able
       to access all classified exposure data, ensuring all releasable data is available for
       maintenance in the MRER and to the monitored individual.
   6.5.5. Reports of dosimetry or bioassay results shall be given promptly to the potentially
   exposed individual and their commander or delegated representative.
   6.5.6. The risks of stochastic health effects (e.g., cancer) are considered directly proportional
   to the total dose received by an individual. Commanders need to be aware of individual dose
   histories when planning future operations where radiation threats exist.
6.6. Medical Diagnosis and Treatment. Personnel receiving unknown doses of radiation or
doses exceeding the limits established for practices should receive care IAW AF Manual 44-161
(l), Treatment of Nuclear and Radiological Casualties, NCRP Report 161, Management of
Persons Contaminated with Radionuclides; and NATO Manual AMedP-6(B), NATO Handbook
on the Medical Aspects of NBC Defensive Operations, Part I - Nuclear, or consistent with
currently accepted practice.
6.7. Medical Surveillance.

  6.7.1. Doses greater than 50 mSv (5 rem): On completion of a military operation or
  operations involving radiation exposure, long term, periodic health monitoring is required for
  individuals receiving cumulative effective doses in excess of 50 mSv (5 rem). Such follow-
  up shall be formed through USAFSAM, and may include, but not be limited to:
     6.7.1.1. Creation of a registry for the impacted population;
     6.7.1.2. Submission of biological or bioassay samples to determine absorbed dose and
     residual burdens of RAM, respectively; and/or
     6.7.1.3. Annual or biannual medical examination, particularly following the latent
     periods of known radiogenic cancers. Known radiogenic cancers include leukemia,
     multiple myeloma, lymphomas, thyroid, breast, lung, esophageal, stomach, urinary tract,
     skin, and colon.
  6.7.2. Doses less than 50 mSv (5 rem): For those personnel who have received doses less
  than current occupational dose limits, testing and monitoring should be limited to those
  testing and monitoring programs included in guidelines for the general population (e.g.,
  routine mammography, pap smears, and prostate specific antigen testing).
     6.7.2.1. Health monitoring may include submission of bioassay samples to document
     intakes of radionuclides, and screening for cancers consistent with current medical
     practices.

Terms
91(b) Material—RAM exempted from NRC licensing controls under Section 91(b) of the AEA
of 1954, as amended, in the interest of national defense, under the possession of the DOD. These
include the RAM in nuclear weapons – e.g., uranium isotopes, plutonium isotopes, tritium, and
other radioactive components of nuclear weapons. These also include the components of nuclear
reactors that fall under the definition of 91(b).
Absorbed Dose—The energy imparted by radiation per unit mass of irradiated material. The
units of absorbed dose are the rad and the gray (Gy); (1 rad = 0.01 Gy).
Activity—The rate of disintegration (transformation) or decay of radioactive material. The units
of activity are the Curie (Ci) and the Becquerel (Bq).
Administrative Dose—An arbitrary value assigned in a dose report in cases where a dosimeter
is not returned for processing at the end of the wear period, is damaged, or which cannot be
evaluated due to other factors. Administratively assigned doses must be investigated by the
installation RSO as "Abnormal Exposures" IAW AFMAN 48-125.
ALARA—Acronym for ―as low as is reasonably achievable‖ means making every reasonable
effort to maintain exposures to radiation as far below applicable dose limits as is practical,
consistent with the purpose for which the activity is undertaken, taking into account the state of
technology, the economics of improvements in relation to benefits to the public health and
safety, and other societal and socioeconomic considerations and in relation to utilization of
nuclear energy, RAM, and radiation in the public interest.
Annual Limit of Intake—The derived limit of RAM taken into the body of an adult worker by
inhalation or ingestion in a year. The ALI is the smallest value of intake of a given radionuclide
in a year that would result in a committed effective dose equivalent of 0.05 Sv (5 rem) or a
committed dose of 0.5 Sv (50 rem) to any organ or tissue.
Background Radiation—Radiation from cosmic sources; naturally occurring RAM, including
radon (except as a decay product of source or special nuclear material); and global fallout as it
AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                              75


exists in the environment from the testing of nuclear explosive devices or from past nuclear
accidents such as Chernobyl that contribute to background radiation. ―Background radiation‖
does not include radiation from source, byproduct, or special nuclear materials regulated by the
NRC or from NARM that the AF regulates through AFI 40-201.
Becquerel (Bq)—The International System of Units (SI) unit of radioactivity is equivalent to
one disintegration per second (dps, or Bq). One curie (Ci) is equivalent to 3.7 E 1010 (37 billion)
Bq.
Bioassay (Radio-bioassay)—The determination of kinds, quantities or concentrations, and, in
some cases, the locations of RAM in the human body, whether by direct measurement (in-vivo
bioassay) or by analysis and evaluation of materials excreted or removed from the human body
(in-vitro bioassay).
Byproduct Material—(1) Any RAM (except source material and special nuclear material)
yielded in or made radioactive by exposure to the radiation incident to the process of producing
or utilizing special nuclear material; (2) the tailings or wastes produced by the extraction or
concentration of uranium or thorium from ore processed primarily for its source material content,
including discrete surface wastes resulting from uranium solution extraction processes.
Underground ore bodies depleted by these solution extraction operations do not constitute
―byproduct material‘‘ within this definition.
Committed Dose Equivalent—The dose equivalent to organs or tissues that will be received
from the intake of RAM by an individual during the 50-year period following the intake.
Conceptus—The developing human organism from conception until time of birth. Referred to
as the embryo/fetus.
Curie (Ci)—A unit of radioactivity equal to 37 billion Becquerels. See definition of Becquerel.
Declared Pregnant Woman— A woman who informed her employer, in writing, of her
pregnancy and the estimated date of conception.
Derived Air Concentration (DAC)—The concentration of a given radionuclide in air that, if
breathed for a working year of 2,000 hours under conditions of light work (inhalation rate of 1.2
cubic meters of air per hour), results in an inhalation of one ALI.
Deterministic Effect—Biological effects for which the severity of the effect in an exposed
individual varies with the dose, and for which a threshold usually exists (e.g., skin erythema and
cataracts).
Diagnostic Source—In the healing arts, a source of ionizing radiation used in the diagnosis of
injury or disease. Includes: x-ray units (fixed, portable, fluoroscopy, computed tomography,
etc.), RAM (capsules, liquids or gases) used in nuclear medicine, and RAM used in a laboratory
setting to perform ―in-vitro‖ studies (on blood, urine, cells, etc.).
Deep Dose Equivalent—The dose assigned to personnel from external whole-body exposure, it
is the dose equivalent at a tissue depth of one cm (1000 mg/cm2 ) which is expressed in units of
rem or Sievert (Sv).
Dose Equivalent—A quantity used for radiation protection to indicate the biological
effectiveness of different radiations to cause stochastic health effects (e.g., cancer). The product
of the absorbed dose in tissue (DT ) and the quality factor (Q), and all other necessary modifying
 76                                             AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


factors at the location of interest where HT = DT Q. The units of dose equivalent are the rem
and Sievert (Sv). (0.01 Sv = 1 rem). The dose equivalent in Sv is equal to the absorbed dose in
gray multiplied by the Q; 1 Sv = 100 rem. Its purpose is to have a single unit, regardless of the
type of radiation, describing the biological effect due to exposure to radiation on man
Effective Dose—The sum over specified tissues of the equivalent dose or dose equivalent in a
tissue multiplied by a weighting factor for that tissue, wT. Expressed in unit of Sievert (Sv) or
rem (100 rem = 1 Sv).
                                                          -19
Electron Volt (eV)—                                             joule.
Equivalent Dose—A quantity used for radiation protection to indicate the biological
effectiveness of different radiations to cause stochastic health effects (e.g., cancer). The
equivalent dose equals the absorbed dose multiplied by a radiation weighting factor, wR.
Expressed in units of Sievert (Sv) or rem.
Exposure—In radiation protection, the act or occurrence of being exposed to radiation or RAM.
In risk management, the frequency and length of time subjected to a hazard.
Gray (Gy)—The SI unit of any absorbed dose. One gray is equal to the absorption of one joule
per kilogram of material (1 Gy =100 rad).
Hazard—Any real or potential condition that can cause injury, illness, death of personnel,
damage to or loss of equipment or property, or mission degradation.
High Radiation Area—Any area with dose rates greater than 100 millirem (1 milliSievert) in
one hour 30 centimeters from the source or from any surface through which the ionizing
radiation penetrates. Areas at licensee facilities must be posted as "high radiation areas" and
access into these areas is maintained under strict control.
Installation—A grouping of facilities located in the same vicinity, which support particular
functions. Installations may be elements of a base. The term ―installation‖ applies to real
properties such as depots, arsenals, hospitals, terminals, and other special mission installations.
Intervention—An activity that is not part of a controlled practice and is intended to reduce or
mitigate sources of existing exposure (e.g., radon in structures); actions that save life or limb or
mitigate threats greater than that posed by radiation; or those that are done to achieve higher
objectives, including those of national security.
Intrinsic Radiation—Radiation emitted through the weapon surface or directly from exposed
components of nuclear weapons.
Investigation Level—1) A dose equivalent value or radionuclide intake activity set by the

           QUANTITIES AND TERMS USED IN RADIATION PROTECTION

A2.1. General. Ionization is the process by which atoms lose, or sometimes gain electrons and
thus become electrically charged. Ionizing radiation are those forms of sub-atomic particles and
electromagnetic waves that are capable of causing ionization in matter. Historically, the
quantities used to measure the ―amount‖ of radiation have been defined by the gross number of
ionizing events in a given mass of material. The most commonly used quantity reported in early
radiation protection was the Roentgen (R) equal to the quantity of x-ray or gamma radiation
producing ions in air carrying one electrostatic unit of charge per cubic centimeter of air. At
standard temperature and pressure, this is equivalent to 2.58x10-4 Coulomb per kilogram of air.
Although this quantity is still in use, the more appropriate units for radiation protection are based
on the ionizations that occur in given mass of human tissue, and the subsequent risk of biological
affect that that ―dose‖ may cause.
A2.2. Absorbed Dose. The fundamental dose quantity in radiation protection is the absorbed
dose, D. This is the energy absorbed per unit mass and is in units of joule per kilogram, which is
given the special name gray (Gy). One Gy is equal to 100 rad, the conventional quantity of
absorbed dose equal to 100 ergs/gm.
A2.3. Quality Factors and Dose Equivalent. The probability of stochastic health effects (like
cancer) is dependent not only on the absorbed dose, but also on the type of radiation causing the
dose. This has been taken into account by weighting the absorbed dose at a point in tissue with a
quality factor, Q, for a given radiation. The quality factor in turn is based on the density of
ionization along a track of the radiation as it traverses a tissue, referred to as its linear energy
transfer or LET. The weighted absorbed dose under this system is called the dose equivalent, H,
and expressed in units of rem. The dose equivalent is the dosimetric quantity used in Title 10,
Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, for the purposes of radiation protection from RAM. For
the purposes of individual monitoring using personnel dosimetry, three specific quantities of
dose equivalent are used:
   A2.3.1. Deep Dose Equivalent, Hd, is the dose equivalent measured at a tissue depth of 1 cm
   (1000 mg/cm2) beneath the outer surface of the skin. It is the primary dose reported in the AF
   personnel dosimetry program. The deep dose equivalent is derived from the more general
   Individual Dose Equivalent, Penetrating, Hp(d). This is defined as the dose equivalent in soft
   tissue at a depth ―d‖ in the body that is appropriate for penetrating radiations.
   A2.3.2. Shallow Dose Equivalent, Hs, is the dose equivalent measured at a tissue depth of
   0.007 cm (7 mg/cm2, the average depth of the germinal cell layer) averaged over an area of 1
   cm2. This is otherwise referred to as the shallow or skin dose in the AF personnel dosimetry
   program. The shallow dose equivalent is derived from the Individual Dose Equivalent,
   Superficial, Hs(d). This is defined as the dose equivalent in soft tissue at a depth ―d‖ in the
   body that is appropriate both weakly and strongly penetrating radiations.
   A2.3.3. Lens Dose Equivalent, HE, is the dose equivalent to the lens of the eye from external
   irradiation. It is measured at an eye lens tissue depth of 0.3 cm (300 mg/cm2).
A2.4. Radiation Quality Factors and Equivalent Dose. The most recent paradigm in
radiation protection emphasizes the absorbed dose averaged over a tissue or organ (as opposed to
 82                                                 AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


a point) and weighted for the radiation quality. The weighting factor for this purpose is currently
called the radiation quality factor (Q) and is selected for the type and energy of the radiation
incident on the body or, in the cases of sources within the body, emitted by the source. The
absorbed dose in a tissue, multiplied by the radiation weighting factors is called the equivalent
dose, HT. This can be expressed as:
H T   QR  DT , R
          R
where DT,R is the absorbed dose averaged over the tissue or organ T, due to radiation R. The unit
of equivalent dose is the joule per kilogram, with the special name Sievert (Sv).

The radiation weighting factor, wR, for a given type and energy of radiation is representative of
the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of that radiation to inducing stochastic health effects
at low doses. The values of Q, and are summarized in Table A2.1.

A2.5. Tissue Weighting Factors and Effective Dose. The relation between the probability of
stochastic effects and equivalent dose also depends on the organ or tissue irradiated. The
effective dose is used to express the probability of occurrence of cancer and hereditary effects
whether the dose is received by the whole body via uniform irradiation or by partial body or
individual organ irradiation. The factor by which the equivalent dose in tissue or organ T is
weighted is called the tissue weighting factor, wT, and represents the relative contribution of that
organ or tissue to the total detriment due to cancer and hereditary effects resulting from uniform
irradiation of the whole body. The weighted equivalent dose is given the name effective dose
equivalent, or more simply, the effective dose, E, and again has units of joule per kilogram with
the special name Sievert (Sv). The effective dose is the sum of the weighted equivalent doses for
all irradiated tissues or organs.
E   wT  H T
      T
where HT is the equivalent dose in tissue or organ T and wT is the weighting factor for tissue T.
Tissue weighting factors are given in Table A2.2. So that a uniform whole body equivalent dose
AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                               83


results in an effective dose that is numerically the same, the sum of the tissue weighting factors is
one.

A2.6. Committed Equivalent Dose and Committed Effective Dose. Following an intake of
radionuclides in the body, there is a period during which the material irradiates various organs
and tissues. The committed equivalent dose, HT() is the integral of the equivalent dose rate in a
specific tissue (T) following intake of a radionuclide in the body. For the purpose of radiation
protection, the time of integration is taken as 50 years for occupational exposures and 70 years
for members of the public. The committed effective dose, E(), for each internally deposited
radionuclide is calculated by summing the products of the committed equivalent doses and the
appropriate wT values for all tissues irradiated. The expression for the occupational committed
effective dose equivalent is given as:
E 50   wT  H T 50
         T

A2.7. Total Effective Dose. This is the sum of the deep dose equivalent, Hd, and committed
effective dose, E(50). Limits on occupational and public radiation dose apply to the sum of
relevant doses from external exposure deep-dose equivalent in a year and the 50 year committed
effective dose from intakes in the same year. The total effective dose can be expressed as:
Et  E 50  H d
A2.8. Working Level Months. Exposure to radon and its progeny is not measured in the
conventional dosimetric quantities described above. Instead exposures are generally indicated by
the working-level, a unit originally developed to describe exposures of uranium miners to radon.
One working level is defined as that concentration of radon daughters in air that has a potential
alpha energy release of 1.3x105 MeV in a liter of air, equivalent to 2x10-5 Joule per cubic meter
of air (J/m3). One working level month (WLM, or 3.5x10-3 Jh/m3) would be the exposure
received by being present in that concentration for one working month, equivalent to 170 hours.
 84                                                              AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012


Exposure to one WLM results in an estimated absorbed dose to the lung of 4 - 13 mGy (0.4 to
1.3 rad). Based on data gather regarding occupational exposures uranium miners, lung cancer
probabilities are estimated in the broad range of 1 to 4 x 10-4 per WLM. One WLM is
approximately equal to an annual exposure of 4 pCi per liter of radon, if the radon decay
products are in 50% equilibrium with the radon.
A2.9. Conversion Between SI and English Units. Rule of Thumb: For radiological protection
purposes, and only for x-ray/gamma radiation environments: 1 R 1 rad. (1 rad = 0.01 Gy and 1
rem = 0.01 Sv)
A2.10. Annual Average Effective Dose Equivalent in the US Population.
Table A2.3 provides a list of common exposure sources and the annual average dose an individual in the US receives from each source.
The rounded annual dose for non-smokers per year is 6.2 mSv, or 620 mrem. It provides a basis for comparison to the limits and dose
guidance specified in this instruction.



Below is a comparison showing the increase in the annual average exposure based on results
from National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Report 160 -- Ionizing
Radiation Exposure of the Population of the United States and Report 93-- Ionizing Radiation
Exposure of the Population of the United States showing recent data indicating an increase of
effective dose. This is namely due to medical exposures.

       course.
   A3.2.2. In the absence of a BE officer or if a unit is geographically separate from one, the
   IRSO should be a 7-level BE Craftsman (4BO71). In the absence of a BE officer or 7-level
   BE Craftsman, an AF civilian employee may be the IRSO provided one of the training and
   experience criteria in paragraph A3.2.1 are met.
   A3.2.3. Contractors cannot be the IRSO. Permittees listed on a permit issued by the AF
   Radioisotope Committee Secretariat cannot be an IRSO unless no other individual meets the
   above qualifications.
   A3.2.4. In addition to the qualifications listed in this instruction, IRSOs must meet the
   qualifications listed in AFI 40-201 or AFI 91-108 if they are applicable to the installation.
   A3.2.5. Know the hazards of the sources of radiation on the installation (including INRAD
   from nuclear weapons and radioactive waste sites).
A3.3. URSO Qualifications.
   A3.3.1. URSO qualifications are based upon the RAM or radiation sources in the unit.
   Table A3.1 lists the training required for URSOs.
   A3.3.2. URSO for units conducting non-destructive inspections using radiation sources. In
   addition to A3.3.1, must meet the requirements in TO 33B-1-1.
A3.4. PRSOs Qualifications.
A3.4.1. PRSOs must also meet the training and qualification requirements listed in AFI 40-201
or AFI 91-108 as applicable.
A3.4.2. There are three types of permits – non-template, template, and medical permits.
Additional training requirements for the RSOs for permits are delineated in AFI 40-201.
   A3.4.3. Know the hazards of the sources of radiation relevant to the permit.

                 MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES OF RADIATION EXPOSURE

A4.1. General. Exposure of living cells by radiation can result in changes to their atoms and
molecules and thus may result in damage to the cells. If cellular damage does occur, and is not
adequately repaired, it may prevent the cell from surviving or reproducing, or it may result in a
viable but modified cell. These two outcomes have very different implications for the organism
as a whole.
A4.2. Risk of Deterministic Effects. Most organs and tissues of the body are unaffected by the
loss of large number of cells following irradiation, but if the number lost is substantial, there will
be observable harm resulting in a loss of tissue function. Such effects require a ―threshold‖
radiation dose to be exceeded before an effect is observed, and generally the severity of the
effect once this threshold is exceeded increases with dose. These ―deterministic‖ effects include
skin erythema, sterility, opacities of the lens of the eye (cataracts) and depression of the blood
forming process. The effects may occur early, within hours or days following exposure; or late,
occurring months or years after exposure.

A4.3. Risk of Neoplasia and Hereditary Effects. For cells that have been altered or modified
and can still reproduce, the potential outcomes are very different. Despite highly effective
defense mechanisms, the reproduction of radiation-modified cells may result, after a prolonged
and variable delay called the latency period, in the manifestation of a malignant condition or
cancer. The probability of cancer usually increases with increments in dose, probably with no
threshold, and in a way that is roughly proportional to dose, at least for doses well below the
thresholds for deterministic effects.
AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                                               89


    A4.3.1. For the purposes of radiation protection, the risk of stochastic effects is assumed
    proportional to dose without threshold, this is also referred to as the linear-no threshold
    hypothesis. The severity of cancer is not affected by dose. This kind of effect is called
    ―stochastic‖ in that it is random or of a statistical nature. If the damage occurs in a cell
    whose function is to transmit genetic information to later generations (i.e., sperm or ovum),
    any resulting effects, which may be of many different kinds and severity, are expressed in the
    progeny of the exposed individual. This type of stochastic effect is called ―hereditary‖.
    A4.3.2. The nominal risks given in Table A4.2 are for radiation induced fatal cancers for the
    general population. In addition, non-fatal cancers occur. Therefore, typical ratios for total
    cancers (fatal plus non-fatal) are given in Table A4.2. Note: These values should not be
    used to interpret individual risks, which are dependent on numerous factors such as age, sex,
    heredity and environment.

A4.4. Effects Following Irradiation In-Utero. The potential effects on the conceptus
following irradiation depend on the time of irradiation relative to conception. When the number
of cells in the conceptus is small, and their nature is not yet specialized, the effect of damage to
these cells is likely a failure to implant or the undetectable death of the conceptus. Irradiation in
the first three weeks following conception is not likely to result in deterministic or stochastic
effects in the live-born child, despite the heart and central nervous system development in the
third week. During the rest of the period of organogenesis, malformations may be caused in the
organ(s) under development at the time of irradiation. These effects are deterministic in nature,
with a threshold estimated to be 0.1 Gy (10 rad). Two additional effects of irradiation on the
developing fetus include severe mental retardation and cancers that may develop in childhood or
in adult life. The periods of sensitivity after conception for these described effects are
summarized in Table A4.3.

1. Report 60, 1990 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. ICRP
Publication 60. Annals of the ICRP 21(1-3), 1991.
2. Malformations of organs appear to be deterministic effect, with a threshold dose in man, estimated from animal
experiments to be 0.1 Gy.
3. The risk of severe mental retardation is associated with an observed shift in IQ of 30 IQ units per Sv to the brain
during the 8th through 15th week after conception, with lesser shifts from the 16 th through 25th week). At absorbed
doses on the order of 0.1 Sv, no effect would be detectable in the general distribution of IQ in an irradiated group.
4. The risk of fatal cancers expressed in childhood or in adult life for individuals irradiated in utero may be similar
to the risk of individuals irradiated in the first decade of life, which is somewhat larger than that for the population
as a whole.

  Notes:
  1. Based on the requirements of Title 10, CFR, Part 20.
  2. The limits apply to the sum of relevant doses from external exposure in a period of 1 calendar year and
  the 50 year committed dose from intakes in the same period.
  3. The mSv is the preferred unit of dose for radiation protection purposes. Current AF instrumentation
  uses the Gy or R as their basic unit of measure, and the MRER reports doses in rem. For low LET
  penetrating radiations (x-rays, gamma rays), the following conversions can be applied: 10 mSv = 1 cSv 
  1 cGy =10 mGy = 1 rad  1 R.
  4. Conditions for Minors: No person under the age of 16 years shall be subjected to occupational
  exposure, and no person under the age of 18 shall be allowed to work in a restricted area unless supervised,
  and then only for the purposes of training
  5. In special circumstances, an effective dose of up to 5 mSv in a single year, provided the average over
  five years does not exceed 1 mSv per year. AFMSA/SG3PB shall be contacted to obtain this variance.
  Also, general public shall not be exposed to more than 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) in any one hour.

          Note: This table is extracted from 10CFR835, Appendix D and NUREG-1575, Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and
          Assessment of Materials and Equipment Manual (MARSAME), Supp.1, Table E.1. In general, this table will not
          apply to contingency operations. For contingency operations follow the COCOM, or equivalent, directives.

          1 The  values in this appendix, with the exception noted in footnote 5, apply to radioactive contamination deposited on, but not
          incorporated into the interior or matrix of, the contaminated item. Where surface contamination by both alpha-and beta-gamma
          emitting nuclides exists, the limits established for alpha-and beta-gamma-emitting nuclides apply independently.
          2 As used in this table, dpm (disintegrations per minute) means the rate of emission by radioactive material as determined by
          correcting the counts per minute observed by an appropriate detector for background, efficiency, and geometric factors associated
          with the instrumentation.
          3 The levels may be averaged over one square meter provided the maximum surface activity in any area of 100 cm2 is less than
          three times the value specified. For purposes of averaging, any square meter of surface shall be considered to be above the
          surface contamination value if: (1) From measurements of a representative number of sections it is determined that the average
          contamination level exceeds the applicable value; or (2) it is determined that the sum of the activity of all isolated spots or
          particles in any 100 cm2 area exceeds three times the applicable value.
          4 The amount of removable radioactive material per 100 cm2 of surface area should be determined by swiping the area with dry
          filter or soft absorbent paper, applying moderate pressure, and then assessing the amount of radioactive material on the swipe
          with an appropriate instrument of known efficiency. (Note: The use of dry material may not be appropriate for tritium.) When
          removable contamination on objects of surface area less than 100 cm2 is determined, the activity per unit area shall be based on
          the actual area and the entire surface shall be wiped. It is not necessary to use swiping techniques to measure removable
          contamination levels if direct scan surveys indicate that the total residual surface contamination levels are within the limits for
          removable contamination.
          5 This category of radionuclides includes mixed fission products, including the Sr-90 which is present in them. It does not apply
          to Sr-90 which has been separated from the other fission products or mixtures where the Sr-90 has been enriched.
          6 Tritium contamination may diffuse into the volume or matrix of materials. Evaluation of surface contamination shall consider
          the extent to which such contamination may migrate to the surface in order to ensure the surface contamination value provided in
          this appendix is not exceeded. Once this contamination migrates to the surface, it may be removable, not fixed; therefore, a
          ―Total‖ value does not apply.

Notes:
1. The use of the measurement milliSievert (mSv) is preferred in all cases. For low LET, whole body irradiation (x-
rays, gamma rays): 1 cGy =10 mGy = 1 rad  10 mSv  1 R.
2. All doses should be kept ALARA. This will reduce individual risk as well as retain maximum operational
flexibility for future employment of exposed personnel.
3. Priority missions are those missions that avert danger to people, prevent damage from spreading, or support the
organization‘s mission essential task list (METL).
4. Critical missions are those missions that are essential to the overall success of a higher headquarters‘ operation,
emergency lifesaving missions, or like missions.

5. This is in addition to the 1:5 and 1:4 incidence of fatal cancer among the general population. Increased risk is
given for induction of fatal cancer. Total lifetime risk is assumed to be 4 – 7 percent per ~1,000 mSv (100 rad). It
must be recognized that higher radiation dose rates produce proportionally more health risks than the same total dose
given over longer periods of time.
6. NATO STANAG 2083, Commander’s Guide on Nuclear Radiation Exposure of Groups, states 125 cGy (125
rad) as the commander‘s upper dose limit.
7. Reference AFMAN 10-2503, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE)
Operations, for recommended operational exposure guidelines based on the commander‘s assessment of the mission
criticality and acceptable risk level.

Notes:
1. From NATO Standardization Agreement 2473, Ratification Draft 1. The specified contamination limits are those
estimated that would limit the total cumulative dose from inhalation of re-suspended material and ingestion of
contamination to less the category Commander Dose Guidance for the operations period.
2. Radioactive contamination is removable (assessed with swipes).
3. If the alpha emitter is undetermined, use high-toxicity emitter column. Low toxicity alpha emitters include
natural uranium, 235U, and 238U. All other alpha emitters are considered to be high toxicity.
4. It is recommended that in Cat 1A, gloves and booties be worn. It is required that in Cat 1B and above, booties,
coveralls, gloves and respiratory protection be worn.

A9.3. Business Practices.
    A9.3.1. The AF-RSC Chair and the AF-RSCES will establish the detailed procedures for
    AF-RSC meetings.
         A9.3.1.1. A formal AF-RSC meeting will occur at least semi-annually, but more
         frequently if determined necessary by the Chair or the majority of the committee. AF-
         RSC meetings are scheduled by the AF-RSCES.
         A9.3.1.2. Ad hoc meetings can be called by the Chair on an as needed basis. These
         meetings are called to address emergent issues that require timely action by the AF-RSC.
         A9.3.1.3. Rapid staffing of an action can be approved by the Chair to address emergent
         issues for which an ad hoc meeting cannot be convened. For a rapid staffing the AF-
         RSCES will prepare a staffing package that addresses the issue and provides the voting
         members of the AF-RSC the ability to vote without meeting. All rapid staffing actions
         will be discussed at the next AF-RSC meeting.
         A9.3.1.4. Quorum for a meeting is established by having a least one-half of the voting
         members present.
    A9.3.2. Meetings will be conducted IAW all applicable policies and procedures. The Chair
    and the AF-RSCES will establish the specific procedures for the conduct of routine meetings,
    ad hoc meetings and rapid staffing actions.
    A9.3.3. Motions and Voting.
         A9.3.3.1. Only members and guests recognized by the Chair may speak.
         A9.3.3.2. Generally, before any item can be discussed, there should be a motion made
         and seconded. Once a motion has been seconded, discussion will follow. After
         discussion, one of four things can happen:
            A9.3.3.2.1. (1) There can be a vote on the motion. In the event of a tie, the Chair
            casts the deciding vote.
AFI48-148_MOODYAFBSUP_I 15 MAY 2012                                                           101


          A9.3.3.2.2. (2) The motion can be amended (second required). Then there can be
          discussion on the amendment. The amendment can be voted. If the amendment
          passes, the motion automatically passes. If the amendment fails, the motion still
          stands and can be discussed until voted.
          A9.3.3.2.3. (3) The motion can be tabled (second required). There can be no
          discussion on a motion to table; a vote must be taken immediately. If the vote is to
          table, no further discussion can take place on the motion.
          A9.3.3.2.4. (4) There may be no action on the motion; therefore it becomes old
          business at a future meeting.
       A9.3.3.3. Motions must be clear and concise. A motion to "improve practices" would be
       vague and discussions could meander. However, a motion to "implement x-ray radiation
       safety practices for a new x-ray device" is specific and could be effectively discussed and
       acted on.
A9.4. Disagreement Resolution. The Chair of the meeting is responsible for maintaining order.
On procedural questions, the Chair's ruling will be determinative and final.
A9.5. Record Keeping.
   A9.5.1. The AF-RSCES will ensure that appropriate files for each meeting are maintained
   IAW all applicable requirements. This will include as a minimum, the agenda, meeting
   minutes, copy of all reference materials, background information, memoranda, standing
   reports, and presentations applicable to that quarters meeting.
   A9.5.2. Committee members are responsible for providing applicable materials to the AF-
   RSCES as requested.
   A9.5.3. Records of AF-RSC meetings, to include agendas, presentations, and meeting
   minutes, shall be kept for the duration of existence of the AF-RSC.
