1. Concept of Operation. This instruction establishes the concept of operation for all levels of
CAIBs:
   1.1. An AF CAIB will be established by the AF/CVA to serve as a forum for cross-
   organizational review and resolution of individual, family, and installation community issues
   that impact the readiness of the force and the quality of life for AF members and their
   families.
   1.2. A MAJCOM CAIB will be established by the MAJCOM/CV to serve as a forum for
   addressing MAJCOM issues and forwarding concerns to the AF CAIB that cannot be
   resolved at the MAJCOM level.
   1.3. An installation CAIB will be established and implemented by the installation
   commander to serve as a cross-functional forum to address installation community issues and
   identify issues to the MAJCOM CAIB that cannot be resolved at the installation level.
   1.4. The focus of CAIBs at all levels is to identify and resolve issues that impact the
   readiness of AF members and their families, promote the perception of the AF as a positive
   way of life, and enhance members’ ability to function as productive members of the AF
   community. The emphasis will be on positive actions and programs that strengthen force
   readiness through a sense of community and assist AF members and civilians, their families,
   and communities to thrive and successfully manage the demands of military life.
   1.5. Without direct access to leadership, information flow can be impeded with MAJCOMs
   subsequently missing opportunities to shape AF policies. To streamline and expedite the flow
   of information, CAIB Chairs may authorize CAIB Executive Directors and IDS Chairs at all
   levels to communicate directly with subordinate and higher headquarters counterparts. This
   authority, however, does not eliminate the responsibility to ensure that senior leadership is
   fully informed on CAIB/IDS issues and proposed actions.
   1.6. Effective functioning of the CAIBs at all levels will require grassroots input on the
   issues affecting individuals, families, installations, and communities. Effective CAIBs will
   function as a forum to give the total AF community an opportunity to have their concerns
   addressed in a cross-functional setting.
2. Membership and Responsibilities for Chairing the CAIB.

                    SAMPLE COMMUNITY ACTION PLAN FORMAT


Purpose: Brief description of the purpose of the Community Action Plan.

Base Mission: Brief description of base mission.

Base Profile: Summary of key community and personnel demographics, including (but not
limited to) age distribution, rank distribution, average commute time for personnel and
dependents who live or work off base, housing availability, numbers of single and married
personnel, single parents, military-married-to-military couples, dependents, retirees, DoD
civilians, contractors, active duty AF personnel, AF Reserve personnel, Air National Guard
personnel, and other military service personnel assigned to the installation.

Additional Factors: Additional factors unique to the local base community that negatively or
positively impact Airmen and their families (listed in bullet format).

Community Result: The body of the Community Action Plan will be divided into Community
Results, which are specific desired outcomes that address or resolve a particular community need
or concern. Generally, the Community Action Plan should focus on one to three community
results. Each community result will have a target group and a rationale for selecting the
community result. Community results are typically long-term benefits and are the consequence
of program results. Each community result is sub-divided into program results.

Program Result: Program results are specific program outcomes that help achieve a particular
community result. Program results are short-term, measurable, and can be attributed to specific
agencies. There can be more than one program result for each community result. Each program
result will have a target group and a program rationale. Each program result is sub-divided into
program activities.

Program Activity: Program activities are specific initiatives or actions implemented to achieve
a program result. Program activities are measurable events or interventions designed for a
specific result. Multiple activities may be listed under each program result. Each activity should
identify both partnership and resource requirements.

Monitoring and Evaluating Performance: Describe specific outcome measures by which each
community result, program result, and program activity be monitored and evaluated.

Timeline: Estimated date of completion for each result and activity.

Signatures: The Community Action Plan will be signed by the CAIB Chair, the CAIB
Executive Director, and the IDS Chair.
