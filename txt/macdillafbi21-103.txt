1. The use of hangars for non-maintenance activities shall be kept to a minimum and shall
have no adverse impact on scheduled or unscheduled maintenance. Hangar usage is
reserved for aircraft maintenance, and any other use will be accommodated on a space available
basis. All non-maintenance hangar use request must be coordinated with the 6th Maintenance
Group Facility Manager and approved by the 6 MXG/CC. Once a request is approved, specific
details will be coordinated through the 6 MXG Facility Manager.
2. Non-maintenance hangar use is limited to group, wing, and major command
(MAJCOM) level functions and must be requested by, or on behalf of, group commanders
or equivalents in the grade of O-6 or above. If alternate facilities are available, they should be
used in lieu of the aircraft hangars. When requesting hangar usage for non-maintenance
activities, the requesting party must complete a Hangar Use Request Staff Summary Sheet
(Attachment 4).
3. The preparation and post event cleaning of the hangar is the direct responsibility of the
requesting unit. To facilitate coordination of hangar use and event activities, the requesting unit
must identify a point of contact (POC) to the 6 MXG Facility Manager for the event. This POC
shall be solely responsible for ensuring completion of the Hangar Request Checklist (Attachment
2) and the Hangar Use/Clean Up Checklist (Attachment 3).
