Section C—ALSE MAINTENANCE AND CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS

3. Aircraft-Installed ALSE Procedures. ALSE must be handled with care to avoid damage to this life
sustaining equipment. Prepositioning equipment IAW this publication allows flexibility while the aircraft
is away from home-station and standardizes ALSE configurations Air Force-wide. The applicable MDS
configuration tables within this publication establish minimum equipment requirements. In AETC flying
units where AMC is the lead command, units are authorized to load aircraft with only the ALSE required
to meet mission requirements. Additionally, AETC Operations Group Commanders (or equivalent) will
ensure an operational risk management assessment is accomplished regarding utilization of ALSE to
safely support mission requirements. In the event installed ALSE comes due while the aircraft is on alert
status or away from home-station, place these items on a red dash until the aircraft goes off alert or returns
to home-station. When aircraft is removed from alert status or returns to home-station, upgrade to a red X,
keeping within the provisions of T.O. 00-20-1.
    3.1. C-5 ALSE:
        3.1.1. Configure aircraft IAW AFI 11-2C-5, Volume 3, Addenda A, C-5 Operations Configura-
        tion and Mission Planning and T.O. 1C-5A-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, C-5A and C-5B Air-
        planes. Aircraft commanders (AC) may request additional equipment be positioned aboard
        aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required. However, units will ensure
        they do not exceed their total equipment authorizations per applicable allowance standards (AS).

NOTES:
               1. Part number (P/N) 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred
                  smoke and fume protection for aircrew personnel. Firefighters smoke masks may be used
                  until 358-series oxygen masks and goggles are available.
               2. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum,
                  each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger. Preposition additional EPOS for
                  increased scheduled PAX loads.
               3. Add parachutes as required by other configuration publications.
               4. The A/C is the preferred LPU for passengers. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one
                  LPU for each passenger.
               5. The LPU-10/P LPU is required to integrate with ALSE and is designed for use by aircrew
                  personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and
                  must not be used as a substitute for this LPU.
               6. Survival Vests are required when parachutes are prepositioned aboard aircraft. Survival
                  vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue or
                  return to duty. Quantities will match number of parachutes aboard aircraft.
               7. Aircraft flying overwater to Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) will load one
                  25-person life raft, five LPU-10/Ps, and five anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers,
                  as required.
               8. For all aircraft transfers, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW permanent transfer configu-
                  ration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, to include PDM aircraft, will contact the losing
                  organization’s ALS section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and
                  inspection records. Gaining ALS organization will conduct an aircraft acceptance inspec-
                  tion and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their
                  respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer aircraft with less than the
10                                                         AFI11-301V2_AFMCSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


               required equipment. The losing organization will make up any necessary shortages from
               on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment installed.
           9. Units are authorized to use the Multifab Survival Limited (MSL) quick-don anti-exposure
              suit as a substitute for the CWU-16/P.
     3.2. C-17 ALSE:
        3.2.1. Configure aircraft IAW AFI 11-2C-17, Volume 3, Addenda A, C-17 Configuration and
        Mission Planning and T.O. 1C-17A-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, C-17A Aircraft. Store ALSE
        not being used in the survival equipment locker located forward and left of the crew entrance door.
        Suspend parachutes from bar with ML-4 survival kits attached to parachute buckles. ALSE is the
        only equipment authorized for storage in the C-17 equipment locker. Store personnel restraint har-
        nesses in the right side drawer under the forward loadmaster station. Crewmembers should return
        all ALSE to storage positions after mission completion. Place EPOS in the under-the-seat pouches
        per mission directives. ACs may request additional equipment be positioned aboard aircraft to
        accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required. However, units will ensure they do not
        exceed their total equipment authorizations per applicable allowance standards (AS).
        3.2.2. Aircraft-installed PBE devices and 358-series quick-don O2 masks are for aircrew use
        only. Install four PBEs in the cargo compartment and two PBEs in the auxiliary crew area (one on
        each side of cockpit doorway). The 358-series mask is the primary mask authorized on the flight
        deck and in the cargo compartment.

NOTES:
               1. 72 ea. above the side wall seats and 2 ea. in the latrine
               2. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum,
                  each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger. Preposition additional EPOS for
                  increased scheduled PAX loads.
               3. Each aeromedical utility panel contains four masks.
               4. Add additional parachutes as required by other configuration publications.
               5. LPU-10/P LPU is required to integrate with ALSE and is designed for use by aircrew per-
                  sonnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and must

           7. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load three LPU-10/P LPUs and three anti-exposure
              suits to support crewmembers, as required.
           8. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW per-
              manent transfer configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, including PDM aircraft,
              will contact the losing organization’s ALS section and initiate transfer of required air-
              craft-installed ALSE and inspection records. The gaining ALS organization will conduct
              an aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any
              equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer air-
              craft with less than the required equipment. The losing organization will make up any nec-
              essary shortages from on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required
              equipment.
           9. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for the
              CWU-16/P.

        3.4.2. When equipment racks are installed, all ALSE except parachutes and attached ML-4 sur-
        vival kits will be stored on the ALSE racks.
        3.4.3. Attach ML-4 survival kits to parachute buckles. ACs may direct repositioning of ALSE
        based on mission requirements; however, ALSE must be readily accessible for bailout. Crewmem-
        bers should return parachutes, kits, and ALSE to their primary position after mission completion.
        ACs may request additional equipment be positioned aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and
        passenger increases, as required. However, units will ensure they do not exceed their total equip-
        ment authorizations per applicable allowance standards (AS).

NOTES:
               1. P/N 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred smoke and fume
                  protection for aircrew personnel. Firefighters smoke masks may be used until 358-series
                  oxygen masks and goggles are available. Smoke masks will not be placed on the flight
                  deck.
               2. Four PBEs will be placed on the flight deck and two in the cargo compartment.
               3. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum,
                  each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger regardless of planned flight altitude. Prep-
                  osition additional EPOS for increased scheduled PAX loads. POKs may be used as a sub-
                  stitute until EPOS is available; however, mixing of EPOS and POKs on the same aircraft
                  is not authorized. If POKs are used, provide one POK for each occupant IAW AFI 11-202,
                  Volume 3, General Flight Rules. EPOS or POKs are not required when flying local train-
                  ing missions and passengers are not aboard aircraft.

           4. Parachutes, ML-4 survival kits, and survival vests are required on all missions. Excep-
              tion: Refer to note 7 for ML-4 survival kits. A minimum of one parachute, survival kit
              and vest, and anti-exposure suit per crewmember will be prepositioned aboard the aircraft
              during increased scheduled crew loads. Place additional parachutes for airdrop missions,
              as required.
           5. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU. Preposition additional LPUs to meet increased sched-
              uled PAX loads. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one LPU for each passenger.
              LPU-10/P LPUs are a suitable substitute for the A/C LPU for passenger use until A/C
              LPUs are available. If LPU-10/P LPUs are used, AC or designated aircrew representative
              will ensure these LPUs are pre-fitted to passengers prior to take off.
           6. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew
              personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and
              must not be used as a substitute for these LPUs.
           7. Only required on designated overwater flights. Quantities will match quantities of para-
              chutes aboard aircraft.
           8. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue
              or return to duty. Quantities will match number of parachutes aboard aircraft.
           9. Only required on designated overwater flights.
           10. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one 20-person life raft, five LPU-10/P LPUs,
               and five anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as required.
           11. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW per-
               manent transfer configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, including PDM aircraft,
               will contact the losing organization’s ALS section and initiate transfer of required air-
               craft-installed ALSE and inspection records. The gaining ALS organization will conduct
               an aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any
               equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer air-
               craft with less than the required equipment. The losing organization will make up any nec-
               essary shortages from on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required
               equipment.
           12. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for the
               CWU-16/P.
     3.5. C-141 ALSE:
        3.5.1. Configure aircraft and position PAX masks for each aircraft configuration IAW AFI
        11-2C-141, Volume 3, Addenda A, C-141 Operations Configuration/Mission Planning, and T.O.
        1C-141B-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, C-141 Aircraft. Configure each C-141 with an applica-
        ble number of PAX masks as missions dictate. ACs may request additional equipment be posi-
        tioned aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required. However,
        units will ensure they do not exceed their total equipment authorizations per applicable allowance
        standards (AS).

NOTES:
               1. P/N 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred smoke and fume
                  protection for aircrew personnel. Firefighters smoke and AWACS masks may be used
                  until 358-series oxygen masks and goggles are available.
               2. Preposition 50 containers with 3 PAX masks installed.
               3. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum,
                  each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger. Preposition additional EPOS for
                  increased scheduled PAX loads.
               4. Add parachutes as required by other configuration publications.
               5. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU for passengers. As a minimum, each aircraft will have
                  one LPU for each passenger.

          6. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew
             personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and
             must not be used as a substitute for these LPUs.
          7. Survival vests are required when parachutes are prepositioned aboard aircraft for bailout.
             Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue
             or return to duty. Quantities will match number of parachutes aboard aircraft.
          8. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one 20-person life raft, four A/C LPUs, and
             four anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as required.
          9. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for the
             CWU-16/P.
     3.6. KC-10 ALSE:
       3.6.1. Configure aircraft IAW AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 3, KC-10 Operations Procedures and
       T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, KC-10A Aircraft. ALSE is contractor operated
       and maintained base supply (COMBS) provided and ALS maintained. Responsibilities are as fol-
       lowed:
          3.6.1.1. Serviceable slide-rafts are inspected by the depot level contractor, installed by main-
          tenance personnel, and are not the responsibility of ALS.
          3.6.1.2. Each KC-10 ALS shop will maintain a minimum of five 7-person life rafts for the 25-
          and 27-pallet configuration (Code E).
          3.6.1.3. Each KC-10 ALS shop will build up one auxiliary survival kit (ASK) for installation
          on each assigned aircraft. To assemble this kit, line a 7-person accessory kit with 1-inch Etha
          Foam, ensuring it will float and pack with survival components (see Attachment 3). Docu-
          ment inspections on applicable AFTO Forms and attach a DD Form 1574, Serviceable Tag --
          Materiel, to each kit annotating date inspected and date due next inspection, and ensure the
          time-change information is annotated on the reverse side of tag. Stencil each ASK with 1-inch
          black letters to read as follows:
                               AUXILIARY SURVIVAL KIT, KC-10
                               SURVIVAL COMPONENTS INSIDE
       3.6.2. Preposition two PBEs on KC-10s; one in the boom operator's compartment and one in the
       cockpit. Position and install the PBEs in such a way to allow crewmembers quick access at all
       times in case of an emergency.
       3.6.3. The aircraft ALSE compartments are restricted to storing anti-exposure suits, infant cots,
       O2 masks’ six foot hose and cable assemblies, a 7-person life raft, survival vests, aircrew body
       armor, MIL-G-635 goggles, and an ASK. ACs may request additional equipment be positioned
       aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required. However, units will
       ensure they do not exceed their total equipment authorizations per applicable allowance standards
       (AS).

NOTES:
               1. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum,
                  each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger. Preposition additional EPOS for individ-
                  ual accommodation kit (IAK) configurations, as required. Preposition one EPOS per
                  maintenance personnel during PDM input.
               2. Preposition raft for 25- and 27-pallet configuration only (Code E).
               3. Preposition additional LPUs for IAKs configurations, as required. As a minimum, each
                  aircraft will have one LPU for each crewmember and passenger. For IAK configuration,
                  preposition 80 LPUs.
               4. Maintain 4 ea. per IAK or the capability to configure 50% of PAI, whichever is greater.

          5. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew
             personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with survival vests and must not be used
             as a substitute for these LPUs.
          6. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue
             or return to duty.
          7. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW per-
             manent transfer configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, including PDM aircraft,
             will contact the losing organization’s ALS section and initiate transfer of required air-
             craft-installed ALSE and inspection records. The gaining ALS organization will conduct
             an aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any
             equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer air-
             craft with less than the required equipment. The losing organization will make up any nec-
             essary shortages from on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required
             equipment.
          8. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for the
             CWU-16/P.
     3.7. C/KC-135 ALSE:
       3.7.1. Configure aircraft IAW AFI 11-2KC-135, Volume 3, Addenda A, C/KC-135 Aircraft Con-
       figuration, T.O. 1C-135(K)R-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, KC-135R Aircraft, and T.O.
       1C-135(K)E(II)-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, KC-135E Aircraft.
       3.7.2. Attach survival kits to parachute buckles and hang in the rear of the aircraft. ACs may
       direct repositioning of ALSE based on mission requirements; however, ALSE must be readily
       accessible for bailout. Crewmembers should return parachutes, kits, and ALSE to their primary
       position after mission completion. ACs may request additional equipment be positioned aboard
       aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required. However, units will ensure
       they do not exceed their total equipment authorizations per applicable allowance standards (AS).
       3.7.3. Live-Aboard Accommodations.
          3.7.3.1. Units will establish aircraft live-aboard capability consisting of live-aboard kits
          (LAK), 3 cases of cold weather (CW) or 4 cases of meal-ready-to-eat rations and 1,800 ounces
          of water as a minimum IAW AMCI 10-450, Volume 3, Aircraft Performance Factors (classi-
          fied). This will allow aircrew to reside on the aircraft for a minimum of three days at forward
          operating locations in support of OPLAN 8044. LAK components are listed in this publication
          (see Attachment 4). Not applicable to AETC and AFMC.
          3.7.3.2. Each organization (supporting OPLAN 8044) will have sufficient LAKs (plus spares)
          for all PAI aircraft. ALS will build LAKs using A-3 bags, A-21 canvas containers, or equiva-
          lent. Inner containers should be assembled with rigid reinforced fiberboard boxes or equiva-
          lent. Inspect kits and contents annually. Document AFTO Form 338, Survival Kit Record, as
          required. Attach a DD Form 1574 to the A-3 bags or A-21 canvas containers, annotating date
          inspected and date due next inspection.
          3.7.3.3. Requirements for subsistence items are shared responsibilities among ALS (delivery,
          uploading, and downloading), Operations and Plans (quantify as per mission needs), and Ser-
          vices (commissary liaison, approval agency, and memorandum of understanding [MOU]).
AFI11-301V2_AFMCSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                                19


               Representatives from these organizations will establish a MOU. The MOU will specify and
               define responsibilities for forecasting, funding, requisitioning, storing, and issuing rations to
               best meet the wing's mission. Responsibilities for subsistence rations and water are contained
               in AFI 25-101, War Reserve Material (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures. Due to the
               lack of proper refrigerated storage facilities within ALS facilities, some rations will require
               courtesy storage at appropriate facilities.
               3.7.3.4. During live-aboard conditions, carbon monoxide detectors are required for all models
               of KC-135 aircraft.

NOTES:
         1. P/N 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred smoke and
            fume protection for aircrew personnel. However, firefighters smoke mask will be used
            until 358-series oxygen masks and goggles and PBEs are updated in T.O. 1C-135A-6,
            Aircraft Scheduled Inspections and Maintenance Requirements.
         2. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum,
            each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger regardless of planned flight altitude.
            Preposition additional EPOS for increased scheduled PAX loads. POKs may be used
            as a substitute until EPOS is available; however, mixing of EPOS and POKs on the
            same aircraft is not authorized. If POKs are used, provide one POK for each occupant
            IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3. Preposition one EPOS or POK per maintenance person-
            nel during PDM input.
         3. MIL-G-635 goggles will be uploaded as sets, and placed above the NAV table, to
            back-fill for missing or defective sets of EEU-series goggles.
         4. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU for passengers. As a minimum, each aircraft will
            have one LPU for each passenger.
         5. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by air-
            crew personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival
            vests and must not be used as a substitute for these LPUs. Altus AFB is only required
            to preposition LPU-10/P LPUs during routine trainer missions.
         6. The restraint harness is only required for aircraft hatch inspections when parachutes
            are not onboard.
         7. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items on the ground while
            waiting for rescue or return to duty. Quantities will match number of parachutes
            aboard aircraft.
         8. LAKs are not required to be uploaded on aircraft when OPLAN 8044 crews are issued
            “A” and “B” mobility bags during processing.
         9. For live-aboard accommodations, refer to paragraph 3.7.3.
         10. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one 20-person life raft, four LPU-10/P
             LPUs, and four anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as required.
         11. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW
             permanent transfer configuration. Units gaining transferring aircraft, including PDM
             aircraft, will contact the losing organization ALS section and initiate transfer of
             required aircraft-installed ALSE and inspection records. The gaining ALS organiza-
             tion will conduct an aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of discrepan-
             cies, to include any equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM in accordance
             with T.O. 00-20-1, section V. Do not transfer aircraft with less than the required equip-
             ment. The losing organization will make up any necessary shortages from on-hand
             assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment.
AFI11-301V2_AFMCSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                      21


                  12. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for
                      the CWU-16/P.
   3.8. Operational Support Airlift (OSA) Aircraft:
        3.8.1. Configure C-9 aircraft IAW AFI 11-2C-9, Volume 3, C-9 Operations Procedures and T.O.
        1C-9A-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, C-9A Aircraft. ACs may request additional equipment be
        positioned aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required. How-
        ever, units will ensure they do not exceed their total equipment authorizations per applicable
        allowance standards (AS). The minimum survival kit (MSK) components for C-9 aircraft are
        listed in this publication (see Attachment 5).

               3. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum,
                  each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger. Preposition additional EPOS for
                  increased scheduled PAX loads.
               4. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU for passengers. As a minimum, each aircraft will have
                  one LPU for each passenger.
               5. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew
                  personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with survival vests and must not be used
                  as a substitute for these LPUs.
               6. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue
                  or return to duty.
               7. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one 20-person life raft, three LPU-10/P LPUs,
                  and three anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as required.

NOTES:
            1. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum,
               each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger.
            2. Units are authorized to use the Air Cruisers Company AC-9 (9-person) life raft as a substi-
               tute for the T-9AF or LRU-14-series life rafts.
            3. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew
               personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with survival vests and must not be used
               as a substitute for these LPUs.
            4. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue
               or return to duty.
            5. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one life raft, two LPU-10/P LPUs, and two
               anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as required.
            6. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for the
               CWU-16/P.
     3.9. VIP Special Air Missions (VIPSAM) ALSE. Due to the unique mission and limited assets of
     the VIPSAM operations and other unique missions, each MAJCOM ALS staff is responsible for sup-
     plementing this publication with requirements relevant to their respective units. Each VIPSAM unit
     will provide their respective MAJCOM with an aircraft ALSE configuration table for each MDS
     assigned.
     3.10. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Missions:
        3.10.1. ALS units, when supporting AE missions and aircrew, will build and maintain the equip-
        ment listed in Table 11. The equipment will be placed in kits assigned to, and deployed with, an
        AE in-flight kit (UTC FFQDM). Each ALS unit supporting an AE squadron will maintain a min-
        imum of 2 AE ALS kits (Table 11.) for WRM. Exception: PACAF and USAFE ALS squadrons
        supporting AE operations will build and maintain eight (8) kits. Individual MAJCOMs will direct
        what units will maintain for local training and operational missions.
        3.10.2. Travis, McGuire and Charleston AFBs will maintain the number of AECM support kits
        listed in Table 12. Seventy five percent (75%) of the total number of AECM support kits at each
        unit will be maintained ready at all times. If the AECM support kit capability goes below the 75%
        level, the unit will immediately notify HQ AMC/DOT in writing. The notification must include a
        detailed analysis of the problem and a projected get-well date.
        3.10.3. Once built, MAJCOMs may authorize ALS sections maintaining AECM support kits to
        seal and place the kits in serviceable storage inspection status and inspect on an annual basis if
        time-change items’ expiration dates permit. Upon notification of the need to deploy the AECM
        support kits, the ALS section will inspect the kit and place each item on a normal inspection cycle
        and deliver the kits to the designated organization within 24 hours.

NOTES:


             1. Cabin/Cargo Area Aircrews will use the EPOS already prepositioned on the aircraft for
                emergency oxygen requirements for preplanned flights up to flight level 350 (FL350). For
                preplanned flights above FL350, all AE aircrew must have a quick-don mask with goggles
                attached (paragraph 3.11.1.) to a walk-around bottle available for use.
             2. Medical crew director (MCD) and charge medical technician (CMT) must have communi-
                cation capability in their quick-don mask.
             3. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue
                or return to duty. The Air Ace™/Ace Advantage™ [Air Advantage™] (paragraph 4.) is
                the primary integrated survival vest and aircrew body armor for AE Squadron personnel.
                The SRU-21/P is also authorized (paragraph 4.3.). AE Squadron personnel are authorized
                to request assigned equipment for unit training events.
             4. Required for preplanned overwater flights only.
             5. CWU-16/P or MAJCOM approved equivalent IAW T.O. 1-1-641.

        3.10.4. Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) Missions. All AE aircrews flying on CRAF aircraft are
        exempt from having to use the ALS equipment in Table 11., except for the 358-series quick-don
        mask. These masks are required for protection from smoke and fumes and emergency decompres-
        sions. Travis and Charleston AFBs will maintain twelve (12) and thirteen (13) kits respectively,
        containing seven (7) each LPU-6/P infant cot life preservers and eleven (11) each EPOS to support
        AE CRAF missions. These CRAF support kits will only be mobilized to support CRAF AE oper-
        ations.
        3.10.5. Table 13. lists contact information for each hub location’s medical logistics area control-
        ling the medical portion of the FFQDM kit. Each ALS section at AE hub locations will contact
        and establish a local notification and delivery plan of the ALS portion of the kits to the medical
        logistics office (paragraph 3.10.3.). Once coordinated, forward the local plan to HQ AMC/DOTL
        and send an info copy to HQ USAF/A3OT. Include these plans in the next review or revision of
        the unit’s operating instructions or local directives.

     3.11. Aircraft-Installed Aircrew Oxygen Masks:
        3.11.1. Quick-don O2 masks (P/N 358-1506V, P/N 358-1390V3 [KC-10s], and P/N 359-A1C12
        [C-21s]) with anti-smoke goggles (P/N 322-70) attached to mask are the preferred aircrew smoke
        and fume protection system. This mask and goggle system may also be used as a preferred substi-
        tute for firefighter smoke masks.
AFI11-301V2_AFMCSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                          27


     3.11.2. Position 358- and 359-series quick-don O2 masks and goggles at each crew station.
     Masks and goggles and other safety equipment must remain with the aircraft while in depot to
     conduct functional check flights.
     3.11.3. Control masks either by serial number or locally assigned number.
     3.11.4. Dust covers or mask bags provide critical protection and are required on all air-
     craft-installed aircrew O2 masks.
     3.11.5. O2 masks installed in the crew bunk area aboard C-5s do not require microphones.
     3.11.6. Conduct routine inspections of aircraft-installed aircrew oxygen masks (i.e., 358-series,
     359-series, AWACS, etc.) on 30-day intervals. Complete disassembly and cleaning inspections are
     accomplished every 90-days. MAJCOMs should continue to emphasize oxygen mask cleanliness
     and serviceability during postflight, mission termination and routine 30-day mask inspections.
     EXCEPTION: Firefighter smoke masks are inspected at intervals IAW T.O. 15X5-5-3-1, Opera-
     tion and Maintenance Instructions With Illustrated Parts Breakdown Fire Fighters and Oxygen
     Smoke Mask Assemblies.
     3.11.6. (AFMC) Oxygen masks not permanently assigned to a single user will be disassembled,
     washed, disinfected and inspected after each use. Exception; for units experiencing high volumes
     of incentive fliers, thoroughly disinfect the mask after each use. Mask will be disassembled,
     washed, disinfected and inspected after incentive flying is complete.
  3.12. Life Rafts:
     3.12.1. Position sufficient types of life rafts aboard each aircraft on overwater flights to accom-
     modate all aircrew and passengers IAW T.O. 14S3-1-3, Type and Number of Individual Survival
     Kit Containers and Life Rafts To Be Used In Various Type Aircraft, and applicable MDS configu-
     ration tables. Place additional life rafts aboard aircraft when required. Ensure a DD Form 1574 is
     attached to each aircraft life raft and aircraft actuation handles for life rafts installed in wing well,
     silos, etc. Ensure the time-change information is annotated on the reverse side of tag IAW T.O.
     14S-1-102. C-141 units will maintain additional life rafts IAW the allowance standard (AS 016)
     for contingencies.
     3.12.1. (AFMC) Flights taking off from Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field are considered over water
     flights. Exception: Helicopters that remain within auto-rotational distance of shore.
     3.12.2. The Air Cruisers Company AC-9 (9-person) life raft received a safe-to-fly recommenda-
     tion from the ALSE Single Manager. Units are authorized to use the AC-9 as a substitute for the
     T-9AF or LRU-14-series life rafts.
  3.13. Life Preserver Units (LPU):
     3.13.1. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU for aircrew and passengers during normal ditching sit-
     uations. Units should pursue replacement of LPU-10/P LPUs for passenger use. The A/C LPU
     does not require pre-fitting prior to flight and is easier to don during emergency situations. As a
     minimum, each aircraft will have one LPU for each passenger during overwater flights. C-141
     units will maintain additional LPUs IAW AS 016 for contingencies.
     3.13.1. (AFMC) Life Preserver Units (LPU) will be worn on all over-water to include
     cross-country flights by aircrew members and passengers of ejection seat and single engine air-
     craft. Designated life preservers will be readily available during all over-water flights on
28                                                          AFI11-301V2_AFMCSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


        multi-place aircraft. Exception; when commercial airline travel is required, unit commander has
        the option of waiving the LPU requirement for cross country flights.
            3.13.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Flights taking off from Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field are consid-
            ered over water flights. No exception for aircraft type.
        3.13.2. The LPU-10/P LPUs are required and are designed to integrate with ALSE. Crewmem-
        bers wearing parachutes, survival vests, anti-exposure suits, and aircrew chemical defense equip-
        ment must use these LPUs during bailout or ditching. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with
        ALSE and must not be used as a substitute for these LPUs.
     3.14. Protective Breathing Equipment (PBE). Units will utilize PBEs, P/N 802300-14, with the
     fire retardant polyethylene (green) storage container, P/N 803753-01, and neoprene neck seal. PBE P/
     N 802300-14 is considered the primary device. Units may still utilize Emergency Escape Breathing
     Devices (EEBD), P/N 802300-11, until item’s service-life expires. Units will not substitute above
     items with PBE, P/N 802300-01, with the polyethylene (daglo orange) container and urethane neck
     seal. ALS personnel should limit how often the PBEs or EEBDs are removed from or installed into the
     container to reduce wear-and-tear on the vacuum-sealed bag. PBEs or EEBDs will remain in their
     original "hard" carrying case to provide fire and puncture-proof protection.
        3.14.1. PBEs are the primary devices used to locate and extinguish an in-flight fire, and afford air-
        crew the required protection IAW Federal Aviation Regulation Section 121.337, Protective
        Breathing Equipment, and technical standard orders (TSO) C99, Protective Breathing Equipment,
        and TSO-C116, Crewmember Protective Breathing Equipment.
     3.15. Passenger Oxygen Kits (POK):
        3.15.1. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. POKs may be used,
        as suitable substitutes for EPOS until EPOS is available. For C-130s and C/KC-135s, preposition
        POKs at passenger positions. Secure the POK on the upper seat support tube using a tie-down
        strap (NSN 5975-00-984-6582 or equivalent) and a quick release snap (i.e., FASTTEX buckle, P/
        N SR1, or equivalent). Position the POK bags to the forward side of the passenger and between the
        seat back webbing to ensure rapid access. Ensure caution tag and retainer pin is removed when
        POKs are prepositioned on aircraft. For KC-135 aircraft, position three EPOS or POKs aboard air-
        craft: one in the latrine, one in the cockpit, and one at the galley. AETC students are allowed to
        preposition POKs, as required.
        3.15.2. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. POKs may be used,
        as suitable substitutes for EPOS until EPOS is available. For C-130s and C/KC-135s, preposition
        POKs at passenger positions.
        3.15.3. (Added-AFMC) Aircrew members are authorized to use EPOS when NOT performing
        aircrew duties during flight.

NOTES:
     1. Part number (P/N) 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred smoke
        and fume and protection for aircrew personnel. Firefighters smoke masks may be used until
        358-series oxygen masks and goggles are available.
      2. For Functional Check Flights, each crewmember is required to have one emergency escape
         breathing device (EEBD), for use in the event of an emergency oxygen requirement, when up
         and about the aircraft, away from primary duty station. EEBD will not be used in situations
         where a walk-around bottle is required by other guidance (technical orders/publications).
      3. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum, each
         aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger.
      4. Each crewmember is required to have one parachute assembly. One spare will be pre-posi-
         tioned onboard the aircraft.
      5. Flotation gear is only required on over water flights as specified by applicable technical
         orders. If 514 FLTS aircrew are utilized to ferry aircraft to/from owning organization, the
         owning organization must supply LSE.
      6. During aircraft PDM inputs, use the MSK as a means of providing minimum signaling and
         survival equipment needs.
      7. Anti-Exposure suits are required in accordance with applicable technical orders. Director of
         Flight Operations (DFO) may waive requirement.

NOTES:
     1. Part number (P/N) 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred smoke
        and fume and protection for aircrew personnel. Firefighters smoke masks may be used until
        358-series oxygen masks and goggles are available.
      2. Each crewmember is required to have one emergency passenger oxygen system (EPOS), for
         use in the event of an emergency oxygen requirement, when up and about the aircraft, away
         from primary duty station. EPOS will not be used in situations where a walk-around bottle is
         required by other guidance (technical orders/publications).
      3. On PDM input/output flights, due to restrictions on EPOS, by commercial carriers, crewmem-
         bers will not be required to carry personal EPOS on these flights. Other required oxygen mask
         and the walk around bottle will be used in lieu of the EPOS.
      4. Each crewmember is required to have one parachute assembly. One spare will be pre-posi-
         tioned onboard the aircraft.
      5. Flotation gear is only required on over water flights as specified by applicable technical
         orders. When flotation gear is required, ML-4 survival kits must be utilized with a one-man
         life raft installed.
AFI11-301V2_AFMCSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                   39


      6. Each crewmember is required to have one survival vest. ML-4 survival kits may be used in
         place of survival vest for non-airworthy functional check flights.
      7. Minimum survival kits are mandatory when survival kits or survival vests are not installed.
         Therefore, during aircraft ferry, depot inputs or deliveries use the MSK as a means of provid-
         ing minimum signaling and survival equipment needs. Units have the option of using a sur-
         vival vest as a substitute for the MSK during PDM inputs or deliveries.
      8. Anti-Exposure suits are required in accordance with applicable technical orders. Director of
         Flight Operations (DFO) may waive requirement.
      9. Passenger demonstration kits will only be used when passengers are to be flown on the air-
         craft.

tion (see Attachment 8). Items not identified as mandatory are recommended components. MAJCOMs
have the option to duplicate signaling devices currently installed in survival vests or mandate the survival
vest as a required item for bailout.

6. Anti-Exposure Suits:
     6.1. Anti-exposure suit requirements are based on aircraft PAI and primary crew complement when
     pre-planned overwater flights meet the criteria of T.O. 1-1-641, Minimum Equipment Requirements
     for Overwater, Arctic, and Desert-Tropic Flights, and intent of AFI 11-202, Volume 3. The CWU-16/
     P may be issued to satisfy this requirement. The anti-exposure suit will provide protection for and
     allow crewmembers to remain in the water longer while assisting passengers into the life raft.
     6.2. Permanently preposition anti-exposure suits on aircraft IAW MDS configuration tables. Units
     may bulk store suits in an A-3 bag or equivalent with a DD Form 1574 attached annotating date
     inspected and date due next inspection.
     6.3. The Multifab Survival Limited (MSL) quick-don anti-exposure suit received a safe-to-fly recom-
     mendation from the ALSE Single Manager. Units are authorized to use the MSL as a substitute for the
     CWU-16/P.
     6.3. (AFMC) The Multifab Survival Limited (MSL) quick-don anti-exposure suit is not authorized.
     6.4. (Added-AFMC) The Director of Flight Operations may waive the requirement for on-board
     CWU-16/P Quick Donning Anti-Exposure suits after considering the following factors. These condi-
     tions must be carefully considered:
        6.4.1. (Added-AFMC) The requirement for anti-exposure suits may be waived when the over
        water portion of flight occurs only during landing approach and departure or if the aircraft is
        within power-off gliding distance to land.
        6.4.2. (Added-AFMC) The requirement for anti-exposure suits may be waived for AFMC air-
        craft with three or more engines which have one engine out performance at all stages of the mis-

      sion profile. Twin-engine transports/utility aircraft which have single engine performance at all
      stages of the mission profile may also be waived.
      6.4.3. (Added-AFMC) The requirement for anti-exposure suits may be waived when not within
      power off glide distance to land, if the following conditions are carefully considered; climate zone
      and existing weather throughout the range of flight, water temperature, operational requirements,
      number and type of aircraft involved, mission altitude, mission area surveillance, location of res-
      cue forces, winds, sea state and its impact on SAR operations.
   6.5. (Added-AFMC) Ejection Seat Aircraft. Constant wear anti-exposure suits will be worn by crew-
   members of ejection seat aircraft on any preplanned over-water flight when the water temperature is
   60F/ 15.5C or less. The Wing/Group Superintendent will determine the type of constant anti-exposure
   used within the Wing/Group. If the water temperature ranges between 60F (15.5C) and 51F (10.5C),
   and the local air temperature is 70F (21.2C) or greater, the unit commander may waive the require-
   ment to wear the anti-exposure suit after considering the following factors:
      6.5.1. (Added-AFMC) Climate zone and existing weather throughout range of flights (reference
      T.O. 14P3-5-81/91).

      (see Attachment 12 (Added)). Place the survival components in a locally purchased or manufac-
      tured container IAW 14S1-3-51.
   10.3. Flying helmets are required for bailout and aircrew performing air defense system missions.
   Helmets will be carried on all missions requiring parachutes or anytime personnel parachutes are
   prepositioned aboard aircraft (not applicable when carrying passengers). Flying helmets must be used
   in conjunction with the parachute to avoid head injuries. Unless otherwise directed in the AFI
   11-2MDS, Volume 3 series publications for mission requirements. In addition, flight helmets are
   required whenever the aircrew requires night vision devices (NVD) and flash-blindness devices
   (MIL-G-635 or EEU-series goggles). Additionally, helmets will be retained for aircrew wearing air-
   crew chemical defense equipment that require NVDs plus flash-blindness devices to perform their
   mission in a contaminated environment.
   10.4. Time-change items and pyrotechnics installed in parachutes going to depot facilities will have a
   minimum of one-year remaining on service-life.

11. Minimum Survival Kit (MSK):
   11.1. MSKs are mandatory when life rafts are not installed during PDM input from stateside loca-
   tions. Therefore, during aircraft ferry and depot deliveries, use the MSK as a means of providing min-
   imum signaling and survival equipment needs. MAJCOMs have the option of using a survival vest as
   a substitute for the MSK during PDM inputs (vests are required when carrying parachutes aboard the
   aircraft).
   11.2. MSK components are listed in this publication (see Attachment 5). Place these survival com-
   ponents in a locally purchased or manufactured metal or fiberglass container, or equivalent, to provide
   protection of survival items.
   11.3. Time-change items and munitions installed in MSKs going to depot facilities will have a mini-
   mum of one-year remaining on service-life. When the MSK is carried on commercial airlines, remove
   the following items IAW T.O. 00-20-1: Signal, smoke and illumination, MK-13 or MK-124; Signal
   kit, personnel distress, A/P 25S-5A; container, waterproof, with matches; and knife, pocket.

     14.1. (Added-AFMC) The wear of the CE vest in the F-15 and F-16 is optional. Aircrew will use the
     CRU-94/P with the port plug installed, CE vest, or CRU-60/P without the CE vest when used in con-
     junction with the MBU-20/P mask. CE will be made available for aircrew use. The total of on hand
     assets will be determined by the Wing/Group Superintendent and can be delegated to NCOIC.
     14.2. (Added-AFMC) If wear of the CE vest is desired, aircrew must remove and secure the port
     plug to prevent FOD. When worn, aircrew will ensure it is properly connected to the CRU-94/P. After
     flight, aircrew will ensure the plug is properly reinstalled.
     14.3. (Added-AFMC) Refer to AFI 11-2FTV3 for further aircrew CE guidance.
15. (Added-AFMC) Mandatory Survival Components.
     15.1. (Added-AFMC) Units will use T.O. 14S1-3-51 and this instruction concerning mandatory sur-
     vival items to be installed in survival kits, vest, and accessory containers.

MAINTENANCE AND CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS FOR AIRCREW AND AIR-
CRAFT-INSTALLED LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT (LSE)
30 SEPTEMBER 2003
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change converts AFI 11-302, Volume 1 to AFI 11-301, Volume 2, re-titles the publication, and trans-
fers the OPR from HQ USAF/XOOP to HQ USAF/XOOT. It rescinds paragraph 3.10.1. through 3.10.6,
and provides improved policy for equipping aeromedical evacuation (AE) crewmembers (AECM) during
deployment operations. It establishes a new basis of issue (BOI) for AE crewmembers (Table 11.), joins
AE LSE with AE kits (UTC FFQDM) (paragraph 3.10.1.), identifies units to maintain AECM support kits
(paragraph 3.10.2.), establishes Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) support kits (paragraph 3.10.4.), and
identifies medical logistics contact information (paragraph 3.10.5. and Table 13.). This change also
deletes the requirement for MB-1 casualty life preserver units to be prepositioned aboard aircraft to
accommodate patients, C-141 units to maintain 250 passenger (PAX) masks, and C-130 units to maintain
5 passenger oxygen kits (POK) for AE kits. See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2003-1, for the
complete IC. A star (Η) indicates revision from the previous edition.
OPR: HQ USAF/XOOT (CMSgt Richard T. Robichaud)
Supercedes: AFI 11-302, Vol 1, 1 October 1999
Certified By: HQ USAF/XOO (Brig Gen Teresa M. Peterson)
3.10.1. ALS units, when supporting AE missions and aircrew, will build and maintain the equipment
listed in Table 11. The equipment will be placed in kits assigned to, and deployed with, an AE in-flight
kit (UTC FFQDM). Each ALS unit supporting an AE squadron will maintain a minimum of 2 AE ALS
kits (Table 11.) for WRM. Exception: PACAF and USAFE ALS squadrons supporting AE operations
will build and maintain eight (8) kits. Individual MAJCOMs will direct what units will maintain for local
training and operational missions.
3.10.2. Travis, McGuire and Charleston AFBs will maintain the number of AECM support kits listed in
Table 12. Seventy five percent (75%) of the total number of AECM support kits at each unit will be
maintained ready at all times. If the AECM support kit capability goes below the 75% level, the unit will
immediately notify HQ AMC/DOT in writing. The notification must include a detailed analysis of the
problem and a projected get-well date.
3.10.3. Once built, MAJCOMs may authorize ALS sections maintaining AECM support kits to seal and
place the kits in serviceable storage inspection status and inspect on an annual basis if time-change items’
expiration dates permit. Upon notification of the need to deploy the AECM support kits, the ALS section
will inspect the kit and place each item on a normal inspection cycle and deliver the kits to the designated
organization within 24 hours.

NOTE:
1. Cabin/Cargo Area Aircrews will use the EPOS already prepositioned on the aircraft for emergency
oxygen requirements for preplanned flights up to flight level 350 (FL350). For preplanned flights above
FL350, all AE aircrew must have a quick-don mask with goggles attached (paragraph 3.11.1.) to a
walk-around bottle available for use.
2. Medical crew director (MCD) and charge medical technician (CMT) must have communication capa-
bility in their quick-don mask.
3. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue or return to
duty. The Air Ace™/Ace Advantage™ [Air Advantage™] (paragraph 4.) is the primary integrated sur-
vival vest and aircrew body armor for AE Squadron personnel. The SRU-21/P is also authorized (para-
graph 4.3.). AE Squadron personnel are authorized to request assigned equipment for unit training events.
4. Required for preplanned overwater flights only.

3.10.4. Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) Missions. All AE aircrews flying on CRAF aircraft are exempt
from having to use the ALS equipment in Table 11., except for the 358-series quick-don mask. These
masks are required for protection from smoke and fumes and emergency decompressions. Travis and
Charleston AFBs will maintain twelve (12) and thirteen (13) kits respectively, containing seven (7) each
LPU-6/P infant cot life preservers and eleven (11) each EPOS to support AE CRAF missions. These
CRAF support kits will only be mobilized to support CRAF AE operations.
3.10.5. Table 13. lists contact information for each hub location’s medical logistics area controlling the
medical portion of the FFQDM kit. Each ALS section at AE hub locations will contact and establish a
local notification and delivery plan of the ALS portion of the kits to the medical logistics office (para-
graph 3.10.3.). Once coordinated, forward the local plan to HQ AMC/DOTL and send an info copy to HQ
USAF/XOOT. Include these plans in the next review or revision of the unit’s operating instructions or
local directives.

C-141, KC-10, and C/KC-135 aircraft and is to be used in conjunction with other MDS configuration pub-
lications and applicable technical orders (T.O.). HQ AMC serves as lead command for this publication, as
well as aircraft, aircrew, and passenger aircrew life support (ALS) systems related to these MDSs, and
ensures the operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness (OSS&E) baselines are preserved IAW AFI
AFI11-301V2_AFMCSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                         75


65-1201. It is also understood the using activity will assume OSS&E responsibility for commercial prod-
ucts used on aircraft IAW AFI 65-1201.


1.1. Supplements. Major Commands (MAJCOM) with these or similar types of MDS aircraft will sup-
plement this publication to meet their specific mission requirements and identify equipment inspection
and maintenance frequencies, as required IAW AFI 33-360, Volume 1. Due to Air Education and Training
Command (AETC), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), and Air Force Special Operations Command
(AFSOC) mission, HQ AETC/DOYL, HQ AFMC/A3V, and HQ AFSOC/A3TL will establish require-
ments to meet mission needs and is authorized to determine unique requirements for assigned aircraft.


2.1. Commanders. Ensure all crewmembers and passengers wear or have access to the appropriate ALSE
for the route of flight and duration of the mission. Commercially procured items are not authorized for use
without prior approval or safe-to-fly recommendation by the respective ALSE Single Manager and MAJ-
COM ALS office of primary responsibility IAW AFI 11-301, Volume 1.


2.2.2. Store, handle, service, and account for items part of the 412A aircrew life support system.


2.2.3. Ensure all ALSE inspections remain current throughout the scheduled mission duration. Ensure air-
craft ALSE will have a minimum of 60 days remaining on its current repack and inspection when depart-
ing home-station for tanker task force operations, integrated tanker unit deployments (ITUD), and 30 days
for channel missions, business efforts, aircraft transfers, etc. Transfer aircraft IAW T.O. 00-20-1, Preven-
tive Maintenance Program General Policy Requirements and Procedures.


2.2.7. Maintain applicable flight simulator ALSE. MAJCOMs will specify frequency and procurement
procedures as agreed upon.


2.2.8. Permanently preposition ALSE to the maximum extent possible at all times to provide mission flex-
ibility, especially when aircraft is away from home-station. This will reduce excessive handling and dam-
age of ALSE. Prepare AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment in duplicate. Maintain a
file of the original and completed AFTO Forms 46 by aircraft tail number for all assigned aircraft for his-
torical purposes.


2.2.9. ALS personnel are not responsible for storing, handling, servicing, or accountability of the follow-
ing items: thermos jugs, fire extinguishers, aircraft portable O2 cylinders, pre-breather O2 assemblies, air-
craft oxygen regulators, groundcrew headsets, flak helmets, flak vests, groundcrew chemical defense
equipment, pyrotechnic flare pistols, E-and-E kits, passenger service equipment, aircraft escape slides,
aircraft first aid kits, hand sanitizers, aircraft night vision goggle lighting components, groundcrew night
vision devices, rear vision devices, Emergency Vision Assurance Systems (EVAS), medications (includ-
ing “go pills”), aircrew tool kits, luggage or baggage loading equipment, non-ALS support equipment, or
items not related to the 412A aircrew life support system.

2.2.10. ALS personnel are only responsible for aircrew active noise reduction (ANR) headsets or aircrew
helmet noise reduction (AHNR) systems approved by Single Managers. MAJCOMs will establish stan-
dardized accountability procedures to issue, store, and maintain ANR headsets IAW T.O. 12R2-4-321-1,
Operation and Maintenance Instructions With Illustrated Parts Breakdown for Headset Assembly
PRU-57(V)2/P, to support assigned MDS-series aircraft.


2.2.11. MAJCOMs authorizing use of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) items unrelated to the 412A air-
crew life support system, will ensure technical order guidance or commercial manuals are provided to
units to assure COTS items are properly maintained IAW AFI 63-1201.


Section C—ALSE MAINTENANCE AND CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS


3. Aircraft-Installed ALSE Procedures. ALSE must be handled with care to avoid damage to this life
sustaining equipment. Prepositioning equipment IAW this publication allows flexibility while the aircraft
is away from home-station and standardizes ALSE configurations Air Force-wide. The applicable MDS
configuration tables within this publication establish minimum equipment requirements. In AETC flying
units where AMC is the lead command, units are authorized to load aircraft with only the ALSE required
to meet mission requirements. Additionally, AETC Operations Group Commanders (or equivalent) will
ensure an operational risk management assessment is accomplished regarding utilization of ALSE to
safely support mission requirements. In the event installed ALSE comes due while the aircraft is on alert
status or away from home-station, place these items on a red dash until the aircraft goes off alert or returns
to home-station. When aircraft is removed from alert status or returns to home-station, upgrade to a red X,
keeping within the provisions of T.O. 00-20-1.


3.1. C-5 ALSE:


3.1.1. Configure aircraft IAW AFI 11-2C-5, Volume 3, Addenda A, C-5 Operations Configuration and
Mission Planning and T.O. 1C-5A-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, C-5A and C-5B Airplanes. Aircraft
commanders (AC) may request additional equipment be positioned aboard aircraft to accommodate air-
crew and passenger increases, as required. However, units will ensure they do not exceed their total equip-
ment authorizations per applicable allowance standards (AS).

3. Add parachutes as required by other configuration publications.


4. The A/C is the preferred LPU for passengers. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one LPU for each
passenger.


5. The LPU-10/P LPU is required to integrate with ALSE and is designed for use by aircrew personnel. A/
C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and must not be used as a substitute
for this LPU.

6. Survival Vests are required when parachutes are prepositioned aboard aircraft. Survival vests provide
crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue or return to duty. Quantities will
match number of parachutes aboard aircraft.


7. Aircraft flying overwater to Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) will load one 25-person life raft,
five LPU-10/Ps, and five anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as required.


8. For all aircraft transfers, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW permanent transfer configuration. Units
gaining transferred aircraft, to include PDM aircraft, will contact the losing organization’s ALS section
and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and inspection records. Gaining ALS organization
will conduct an aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any equip-
ment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer aircraft with less than
the required equipment. The losing organization will make up any necessary shortages from on-hand
assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment installed.


9. Units are authorized to use the Multifab Survival Limited (MSL) quick-don anti-exposure suit as a sub-
stitute for the CWU-16/P.


3.2. C-17 ALSE:


3.2.1. Configure aircraft IAW AFI 11-2C-17, Volume 3, Addenda A, C-17 Configuration and Mission
Planning and T.O. 1C-17A-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, C-17A Aircraft. Store ALSE not being used
in the survival equipment locker located forward and left of the crew entrance door. Suspend parachutes
from bar with ML-4 survival kits attached to parachute buckles. ALSE is the only equipment authorized
for storage in the C-17 equipment locker. Store personnel restraint harnesses in the right side drawer under
the forward loadmaster station. Crewmembers should return all ALSE to storage positions after mission
completion. Place EPOS in the under-the-seat pouches per mission directives. ACs may request additional
equipment be positioned aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required.
However, units will ensure they do not exceed their total equipment authorizations per applicable allow-
ance standards (AS).

each occupant IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules. EPOS or POKs are not required when
flying local training missions and passengers are not aboard aircraft.


5. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU. Preposition additional LPUs to meet increased scheduled PAX
loads. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one LPU for each passenger. LPU-10/P LPUs are a suitable
substitute for the A/C LPU for passenger use until A/C LPUs are available. If LPU-10/P LPUs are used,
AC or designated aircrew representative will ensure these LPUs are pre-fitted to passengers prior to take
off.


6. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew personnel. A/
C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and must not be used as a substitute
for these LPUs.


8. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue or return to

NOTES:


1. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum, each aircraft will
have one EPOS per passenger. Preposition additional EPOS for individual accommodation kit (IAK) con-
figurations, as required. Preposition one EPOS per maintenance personnel during PDM input.


3. Preposition additional LPUs for IAKs configurations, as required. As a minimum, each aircraft will
have one LPU for each crewmember and passenger. For IAK configuration, preposition 80 LPUs.


4. Maintain 4 ea. per IAK or the capability to configure 50% of PAI, whichever is greater.

5. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew personnel. A/
C LPUs are not compatible for use with survival vests and must not be used as a substitute for these LPUs.


7. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW permanent trans-
fer configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, including PDM aircraft, will contact the losing orga-
nization’s ALS section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and inspection records.
The gaining ALS organization will conduct an aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of dis-
crepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not
transfer aircraft with less than the required equipment. The losing organization will make up any neces-
sary shortages from on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment.


8. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for the CWU-16/P.


3.7. C/KC-135 ALSE:


3.7.1. Configure aircraft IAW AFI 11-2KC-135, Volume 3, Addenda A, C/KC-135 Aircraft Configura-
tion, T.O. 1C-135(K)R-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, KC-135R Aircraft, and T.O. 1C-135(K)E(II)-1,
Flight Manual, USAF Series, KC-135E Aircraft.


3.7.2. Attach survival kits to parachute buckles and hang in the rear of the aircraft. ACs may direct repo-
sitioning of ALSE based on mission requirements; however, ALSE must be readily accessible for bailout.
Crewmembers should return parachutes, kits, and ALSE to their primary position after mission comple-
tion. ACs may request additional equipment be positioned aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and
passenger increases, as required. However, units will ensure they do not exceed their total equipment
authorizations per applicable allowance standards (AS).


3.7.3.1. Units will establish aircraft live-aboard capability consisting of live-aboard kits (LAK), 3 cases of
cold weather (CW) or 4 cases of meal-ready-to-eat rations and 1,800 ounces of water as a minimum IAW
AMCI 10-450, Volume 3, Aircraft Performance Factors (classified). This will allow aircrew to reside on
the aircraft for a minimum of three days at forward operating locations in support of OPLAN 8044. LAK
components are listed in this publication (see Attachment 4). Not applicable to AETC and AFMC.


3.7.3.2. Each organization (supporting OPLAN 8044) will have sufficient LAKs (plus spares) for all PAI
aircraft. ALS will build LAKs using A-3 bags, A-21 canvas containers, or equivalent. Inner containers
should be assembled with rigid reinforced fiberboard boxes or equivalent. Inspect kits and contents annu-
ally. Document AFTO Form 338, Survival Kit Record, as required. Attach a DD Form 1574 to the A-3
bags or A-21 canvas containers, annotating date inspected and date due next inspection.
AFI11-301V2_AFMCSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                            87


3.7.3.3. Requirements for subsistence items are shared responsibilities among ALS (delivery, uploading,
and downloading), Operations and Plans (quantify as per mission needs), and Services (commissary liai-
son, approval agency, and memorandum of understanding [MOU]). Representatives from these organiza-
tions will establish a MOU. The MOU will specify and define responsibilities for forecasting, funding,
requisitioning, storing, and issuing rations to best meet the wing's mission. Responsibilities for subsis-
tence rations and water are contained in AFI 25-101, War Reserve Material (WRM) Program Guidance
and Procedures. Due to the lack of proper refrigerated storage facilities within ALS facilities, some
rations will require courtesy storage at appropriate facilities.

NOTES:


1. P/N 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred smoke and fume protection for
aircrew personnel. However, firefighters smoke mask will be used until 358-series oxygen masks and
goggles and PBEs are updated in T.O. 1C-135A-6, Aircraft Scheduled Inspections and Maintenance
Requirements.


2. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum, each aircraft will
have one EPOS per passenger regardless of planned flight altitude. Preposition additional EPOS for
increased scheduled PAX loads. POKs may be used as a substitute until EPOS is available; however, mix-
ing of EPOS and POKs on the same aircraft is not authorized. If POKs are used, provide one POK for
each occupant IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3. Preposition one EPOS or POK per maintenance personnel
during PDM input.


3. MIL-G-635 goggles will be uploaded as sets, and placed above the NAV table, to back-fill for missing
or defective sets of EEU-series goggles.


4. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU for passengers. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one LPU for
each passenger.


5. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew personnel. A/
C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and must not be used as a substitute
for these LPUs. Altus AFB is only required to preposition LPU-10/P LPUs during routine trainer mis-
sions.


6. The restraint harness is only required for aircraft hatch inspections when parachutes are not onboard.


7. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items on the ground while waiting for res-
cue or return to duty. Quantities will match number of parachutes aboard aircraft.


8. LAKs are not required to be uploaded on aircraft when OPLAN 8044 crews are issued “A” and “B”
mobility bags during processing.


10. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one 20-person life raft, four LPU-10/P LPUs, and four
anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as required.
AFI11-301V2_AFMCSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                        89


11. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW permanent
transfer configuration. Units gaining transferring aircraft, including PDM aircraft, will contact the losing
organization ALS section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and inspection records.
The gaining ALS organization will conduct an aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of dis-
crepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM in accordance with T.O.

NOTES:


3. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one life raft, three LPU-10/P LPUs, and three anti-exposure
suits to support crewmembers, as required.


4. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for the CWU-16/P.


3.8.3. Configure C-21 aircraft IAW AFI 11-2C-21, Volume 3, C-21 Operations Procedures and T.O.
1C-21A-1, USAF Model, C-21A Aircraft Flight Manual. ALS will maintain sufficient quantities of life
rafts for C-21 aircraft to satisfy contingency requirements based on unit type codes (UTC) and to support
overwater flights. Non-mobility units will maintain at least one T-9AF or LRU-14-series life raft for con-
tingency purposes. T-9AF and LRU-14-series life raft accessory components are listed in this publication
(see Attachment 6). The MSK components for C-21 aircraft are listed in this publication (see Attach-
ment 5). ACs may request additional equipment be positioned aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew
and passenger increases, as required. However, units will ensure they do not exceed their total equipment
authorizations per applicable allowance standards (AS).

NOTES:


2. Units are authorized to use the Air Cruisers Company AC-9 (9-person) life raft as a substitute for the
T-9AF or LRU-14-series life rafts.


3. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew personnel. A/
C LPUs are not compatible for use with survival vests and must not be used as a substitute for these LPUs.


4. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue or return to
duty.


5. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one life raft, two LPU-10/P LPUs, and two anti-exposure
suits to support crewmembers, as required.


6. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for the CWU-16/P.


3.9. VIP Special Air Missions (VIPSAM) ALSE. Due to the unique mission and limited assets of the
VIPSAM operations and other unique missions, each MAJCOM ALS staff is responsible for supplement-
ing this publication with requirements relevant to their respective units. Each VIPSAM unit will provide
their respective MAJCOM with an aircraft ALSE configuration table for each MDS assigned.


3.10.5. Table 13. lists contact information for each hub location’s medical logistics area controlling the
medical portion of the FFQDM kit. Each ALS section at AE hub locations will contact and establish a
local notification and delivery plan of the ALS portion of the kits to the medical logistics office (para-
graph 3.10.3.). Once coordinated, forward the local plan to HQ AMC/DOTL and send an info copy to HQ
USAF/A3OT. Include these plans in the next review or revision of the unit’s operating instructions or
local directives.


3.11.6. Conduct routine inspections of aircraft-installed aircrew oxygen masks (i.e., 358-series,
359-series, AWACS, etc.) on 30-day intervals. Complete disassembly and cleaning inspections are
accomplished every 90-days. MAJCOMs should continue to emphasize oxygen mask cleanliness and ser-
viceability during postflight, mission termination and routine 30-day mask inspections. EXCEPTION:
Firefighter smoke masks are inspected at intervals IAW T.O. 15X5-5-3-1, Operation and Maintenance
Instructions With Illustrated Parts Breakdown Fire Fighters and Oxygen Smoke Mask Assemblies.


3.12. Life Rafts:
AFI11-301V2_AFMCSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                         93


3.12.1. Position sufficient types of life rafts aboard each aircraft on overwater flights to accommodate all
aircrew and passengers IAW T.O. 14S3-1-3, Type and Number of Individual Survival Kit Containers and
Life Rafts To Be Used In Various Type Aircraft, and applicable MDS configuration tables. Place additional
life rafts aboard aircraft when required. Ensure a DD Form 1574 is attached to each aircraft life raft and
aircraft actuation handles for life rafts installed in wing well, silos, etc. Ensure the time-change informa-
tion is annotated on the reverse side of tag IAW T.O. 14S-1-102. C-141 units will maintain additional life
rafts IAW the allowance standard (AS 016) for contingencies.


3.12.2. The Air Cruisers Company AC-9 (9-person) life raft received a safe-to-fly recommendation from
the ALSE Single Manager. Units are authorized to use the AC-9 as a substitute for the T-9AF or
LRU-14-series life rafts.


3.13.1. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU for aircrew and passengers during normal ditching situations.
Units should pursue replacement of LPU-10/P LPUs for passenger use. The A/C LPU does not require
pre-fitting prior to flight and is easier to don during emergency situations. As a minimum, each aircraft
will have one LPU for each passenger during overwater flights. C-141 units will maintain additional
LPUs IAW AS 016 for contingencies.


3.13.2. The LPU-10/P LPUs are required and are designed to integrate with ALSE. Crewmembers wear-
ing parachutes, survival vests, anti-exposure suits, and aircrew chemical defense equipment must use
these LPUs during bailout or ditching. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with ALSE and must not be
used as a substitute for these LPUs.


3.14. Protective Breathing Equipment (PBE). Units will utilize PBEs, P/N 802300-14, with the fire
retardant polyethylene (green) storage container, P/N 803753-01, and neoprene neck seal. PBE P/N
802300-14 is considered the primary device. Units may still utilize Emergency Escape Breathing Devices
(EEBD), P/N 802300-11, until item’s service-life expires. Units will not substitute above items with PBE,
P/N 802300-01, with the polyethylene (daglo orange) container and urethane neck seal. ALS personnel
should limit how often the PBEs or EEBDs are removed from or installed into the container to reduce
wear-and-tear on the vacuum-sealed bag. PBEs or EEBDs will remain in their original "hard" carrying
case to provide fire and puncture-proof protection.


3.14.1. PBEs are the primary devices used to locate and extinguish an in-flight fire, and afford aircrew the
required protection IAW Federal Aviation Regulation Section 121.337, Protective Breathing Equipment,
and technical standard orders (TSO) C99, Protective Breathing Equipment, and TSO-C116, Crewmember
Protective Breathing Equipment.


3.15.1. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. POKs may be used, as suit-
able substitutes for EPOS until EPOS is available. For C-130s and C/KC-135s, preposition POKs at pas-
senger positions. Secure the POK on the upper seat support tube using a tie-down strap (NSN
5975-00-984-6582 or equivalent) and a quick release snap (i.e., FASTTEX buckle, P/N SR1, or equiva-
94                                                           AFI11-301V2_AFMCSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


lent). Position the POK bags to the forward side of the passenger and between the seat back webbing to
ensure rapid access. Ensure caution tag and retainer pin is removed when POKs are prepositioned on air-
craft. For KC-135 aircraft, position three EPOS or POKs aboard aircraft: one in the latrine, one in the
cockpit, and one at the galley. AETC students are allowed to preposition POKs, as required.


3.15.2. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. POKs may be used, as suit-
able substitutes for EPOS until EPOS is available. For C-130s and C/KC-135s, preposition POKs at pas-
senger positions.


4. Survival Vest and Aircrew Body Armor:
4.1. During contingency missions, permanently prepositioned the integrated Air Ace™/Ace Advantage™
[Air Advantage™] survival vest and aircrew body armor (on all aircraft as indicated in the applicable
MDS configuration tables. A trademark of Survival Incorporated. C-17, C-130, KC-10, and KC-135 air-
craft will have survival vests prepositioned aboard aircraft at all times.


4.4.2. Stencil each container with at least 1-inch letters (all caps) on ends to read as follows:


Command (e.g., AMC, USAFE, PACAF, AFRC, or ANG)                        AMC
Unit/ (e.g., 123 AW or 456 ARW)                                        123 AW
Unit Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) Code                            SFILFS2X
Local ID Number (e.g., Kit 1A)                                         KIT 1A


6.1. Anti-exposure suit requirements are based on aircraft PAI and primary crew complement when
pre-planned overwater flights meet the criteria of T.O. 1-1-641, Minimum Equipment Requirements for
Overwater, Arctic, and Desert-Tropic Flights, and intent of AFI 11-202, Volume 3. The CWU-16/P may
be issued to satisfy this requirement. The anti-exposure suit will provide protection for and allow crew-
members to remain in the water longer while assisting passengers into the life raft.


6.3. The Multifab Survival Limited (MSL) quick-don anti-exposure suit received a safe-to-fly recommen-
dation from the ALSE Single Manager. Units are authorized to use the MSL as a substitute for the
CWU-16/P.


8.1. PCKs contain protective clothing for use by aircrew during emergencies aboard aircraft carrying haz-
ardous cargo IAW Air Force Joint Manual (AFJMAN) 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Mili-
tary Air Shipments. Each PCK will contain the components listed in this publication (see Attachment 9).
Units may build kits IAW AFJMAN 24-204 or purchase commercial kits meeting or exceeding AFJMAN
24-204 requirements. Units should contact base environmental or fire protection personnel to determine
adequacy of commercial kits being considered.
AFI11-301V2_AFMCSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                     95



10.2. Personnel parachutes will be equipped with emergency locator beacons, automatic releases, emer-
gency bailout oxygen cylinders, hook-blade knives, oxygen connector brackets, AFP 64-15, Survival and
Emergency Uses of the Parachute (will convert to Air Force Pamphlet [AFPAM] 36-2242), Survival Kit
(SRU-16/P), and personnel lowering devices (PLD). The installation of PLDs is at the discretion of each
MAJCOM.


10.2.1. DELETED.


10.3. Flying helmets are required for bailout and aircrew performing air defense system missions. Hel-
mets will be carried on all missions requiring parachutes or anytime personnel parachutes are preposi-
tioned aboard aircraft (not applicable when carrying passengers). Flying helmets must be used in
conjunction with the parachute to avoid head injuries. Unless otherwise directed in the AFI 11-2MDS,
Volume 3 series publications for mission requirements. In addition, flight helmets are required whenever
the aircrew requires night vision devices (NVD) and flash-blindness devices (MIL-G-635 or EEU-series
goggles). Additionally, helmets will be retained for aircrew wearing aircrew chemical defense equipment
that require NVDs plus flash-blindness devices to perform their mission in a contaminated environment.


12.1. The AC or a designated aircrew representative is responsible for briefing passengers on emergency
equipment before each flight IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, T.O. 14D1-2-1, Personnel Parachutes, and
T.O. 14S-1-102. Passenger-carrying aircraft will have a set of demonstration ALSE mirroring all onboard
individually issued passenger equipment (i.e., LPUs, EPOS, oxygen masks, etc.). Do not include LPU-6/
P LPUs as part of the demonstration kit.


12.2. To keep this equipment segregated from operational assets, store demonstration equipment in a
“red” locally manufactured storage container. Stencil both the storage container and each piece of ALSE
"FOR DEMONSTRATION ONLY" in 1/2-inch black (or contrasting color) lettering.
