1. General Information.
     1.1. This instruction identifies process changes due to Base Realignment and Closure 2005,
     and standard depot maintenance process, and must be complied with. Major changes
     include: the roles and responsibilities of the PST/PSS in this process, and the transfer of
     materiel requirements between the AF and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), located in
     Ogden, Utah. This instruction contains guidance necessary to order non-stock listed (NSL)
     materiel utilizing a Department of Defense (DD) Form 1348-6, Single Line Item Requisition
     System Document, DOD (Manual-Long). The PST/PSS will submit the P/N request, via the
     Part Number Supply Support Request System (PNSSRS) automated DD Form 1348-6 P/N
     requisitions. These are manual inputs for NSL items that have a Technical Order (TO)
     governing the procurement of the item. Requesting a P/N requisition that does not have a TO
     reference should be rare, and will require justification. NOTE: Justification for not having a
     TO reference should be addressed in block 11 (Remarks) of the PNSSRS (i.e. work off
     drawings), and in block 9 (End Item Application) include the weapons system.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The PST/PSS has specific responsibilities when processing a P/N request. Research is a
     key function at all levels to ensure the required item is made available, as expeditiously as
     possible, to support the workload.
3. Procedures.
     3.1. The PST/PSS will accomplish research using the AF Master Item Identification Data
     Base (D043A) system to determine if the P/N has been cataloged to a national stock number
     (NSN), and the source of supply (SOS) is valid.
309MXWI23-106 9 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  3


     3.1.1. If the materiel is hazardous, and/or the federal stock class (FSC) indicates the item
     is managed by the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), the request should be processed
     to the SBSS Research Unit (Building 900) for further action, as referenced by AFMAN
     23-110, Volume 2 , Part 2, Chapter 27, Table 27B5.1 Federal Supply Classes
     (Attachment 2).
     3.1.2. If a valid NSN is found in the D043A system, the PST/PSS will coordinate with
     the DLA customer support specialist (CSS) to have the stock number loaded into the
     Wholesale and Retail Receiving and Shipping System (WARRS/D035K), and the Naval
     Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Industrial Materiel Management System (NIMMS).
     Once the stock number is loaded into WARRS/D035K and NIMMS, the part can be
     ordered through the Automated Bill of Material (ABOM) system. If no NSN is found,
     contact the mechanic or planner to assist in filling out the P/N worksheet (Attachment 3)
     before submitting a DD Form 1348-6. Annotate in the required delivery date field
     mission capability (MICAP)/potential work stoppage, if it meets the requirements (refer
     paragraph 3.3.1.1 and paragraph 3.3.1.2 for requirements). NOTE: If a non-cataloged
     (NC) number or a non-definitive (ND) number is assigned to the P/N in D043A, you
     must still submit a DD Form 1348-6 in PNSSRS.
  3.2. Access to the PNSSRS website is https://pnssrsadm/pnssrsadm/. From the purchase
  request actions home page screen (Attachment 4), click DD Form 1348-6.
  3.3. Input all required data into the DD Form 1348-6 from the P/N worksheet, and ensure the
  data is complete and accurate. The electronic DD Form 1348-6 areas highlighted in gray are
  mandatory fields (see Attachment 5). NOTE: Additional information can be provided in
  box 8, Description of Item Requested. If a request was previously submitted, a base assigned
  control number, Ogden (PG) number will be available in PNSSRS; this only captures
  historical demands. A new DD Form 1348-6 is still required for the item.
     3.3.1. The TO figure and index for the P/N and the source, maintenance and
     recoverability (SMR) Code (Attachment 6) will be entered on the DD Form 1348-6. If
     there is no TO available, use the next higher assembly TO or drawing number.
     3.3.2. The production information input screen (see Attachment A7.1) for the DD Form
     1348-6 just created will be found on the DD Form 1348-6 drop down menu, and the
     following information must be entered (see Attachment A7.2):
         3.3.2.1. The end item document number; standard reporting designator; production
         control number (PCN); operation number, and a valid job order number (JON).
         NOTE: Be sure the end item document number, PCN, and JON are current and on
         work. When entering the priority and the required delivery date, ensure they are
         realistic and reflects the actual time frames for the maintenance technician. DLA
         Aviation is not responsible to provide this information.
     3.3.3. If required materiel has been identified as MICAP or has potential work stoppage
     impact, and the 309 MXW would like to utilize the government purchase card (GPC), in
     block 11 on the electronic DD Form 1348-6 state, ―Item is to support a MICAP or to
     eliminate a potential work stoppage, please notify (name and phone number of requestor)
     when the package is less than $3,000‖.
4                                                       309MXWI23-106 9 DECEMBER 2011


           3.3.3.1. Work stoppage GPC buy decisions will be based on the applicable guidance
           for aircraft undergoing depot repair. Some examples include, but not limited to: the
           aircraft is unable to move to the next production cell; the aircraft is unable to move to
           functional test or out of functional test; flow days will be extended or increased; the
           Aircraft and Missile Maintenance Production Compression Report date is impacted.
           For exchangeable/commodities some examples include, but not limited to: there is no
           work around, and an operation cannot be completed and it impacts the repair shops
           ability to produce the end item on time; there is no work around, and the production
           line will be shut down; there is no work around, and the end item will have to go into
           awaiting parts (AWP) status.
           3.3.3.2. MICAP buys must go through the procedures outlined in AFMAN 23-110.
           The 309th Aircraft Maintenance Group, 309th Commodities Maintenance Group,
           309th Electronic Maintenance Group, 309th Missile Maintenance Group, and 309th
           Software Maintenance Group MICAP status is only authorized when the end item
           supported is MICAP. If a MICAP condition exists, and can be verified in D035A or
           WARRS/D035K, the item manager will provide the tail number of the aircraft that
           has the MICAP situation, or the serial number of the end item that is a MICAP to the
           priority cell.
       3.3.4. For emergency buys that go to the priority cell intended for local purchase with
       only one vendor identified, or multiple vendors identified, but only one of the vendors
       can meet our delivery requirements; a Sole Source Justification letter (Attachment 8)
       and/or an Urgency of Need letter (Attachment 9) will be provided by the PST/PSS with
       the DD Form 1348-6 request based on input from the equipment specialist (ES). These
       letters are necessary when unusual and compelling circumstances exist (i.e., going
       through full and open competition would result in a work stoppage, or severe financial
       impact to maintenance).
    3.4. DLA reviews the request and establishes a PG number, or uses an existing PG number.
    The maintenance backorder (B/O) will then be established with the information provided in
    paragraph 3.3.2.1. The PST/PSS may use this PG number to monitor their B/Os. A local
    purchase (LP) number will be established in ABOM to facilitate communication between
    ABOM/NIMMS, and WARRS/D035K. NOTE: DLA assigns PG number/LP number and
    the Air Force Global Logistics Support Center (AFGLSC) assigns ND number. The
    PST/PSS must query ABOM/NIMMS to ensure stock numbers are linked to prevent errors
    when materiel is issued to maintenance (see Attachment 10, Figure A10.1 – A10-3.).
       3.4.1. DLA updates the comments page in PNSSR (see Attachment 11, Figure A11.1 -
       A11.4) with the AFGLSC actions, and can be viewed by the PST/PSS for status of the
       B/O. NOTE: Contact the shop CSS for status and delivery dates.
           3.4.1.1. If the request package is identified to be under the $3,000 threshold, and you
           have entered the MICAP or work stoppage statement, DLA will send the package
           back to the originator with a recommended source and quote from the ES. The GPC
           will only be used for direct materiel purchases that meet MICAP or potential work
           stoppage criteria. NOTE: The PST/PSS must ensure proper documentation is
           included in the package (i.e., recommended source and quote from the ES). 309
           MXW is then authorized to purchase using the GPC. The PST/PSS will provide
309MXWI23-106 9 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 5


          contact information to the GPC holder for coordination purposes. The GPC holder
          must coordinate with the resource advisor after materiel is received, to ensure a cost
          transfer is preformed.
          3.4.1.2. GPC holder must provide contact information to the vendor. Materiel will
          be shipped directly to the GPC holder, and then the GPC holder will contact PST/PSS
          for delivery to the mechanic. DLA will not receive a receipt in GPC purchases.
          3.4.1.3. Both the PST/PSS and GPC holder need to retain all documentation
          pertaining to GPC purchases IAW current policy and regulations. In addition, log all
          purchases on the P/N emergency buy log (Attachment 12) for tracking and audit
          purposes. Send a copy of the log for the previous month to 309 MXW Business
          Office (OBWP) on the 10th of each month.
   3.5. If PNSSRS is not available, fill out a manual DD Form 1348-6 which can be obtained at
   http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd1348-6.pdf. The DD Form
   1348-6 may be hand carried or faxed to the priority cell.
4. P/N Requisitions to Contractor Inventory Control Point (C-ICP)/Depot Maintenance
Partnership Workload.
   4.1. Depot partnering is defined as an agreement between any C-ICP, and depot
   maintenance; in which depot maintenance agrees to perform a specific workload for that C-
   ICP. These workloads are completely defined within individual implementation agreement
   (IAs), and or statements of work (SOW) between each C-ICP and the affected maintenance
   organization. Whereas requirements within individual IAs or SOW may differ greatly, air
   staff has mandated use of current AF legacy systems to the greatest extent possible, to track
   induction, repair, parts ordering, and turn-in of materiel.
   4.2. PST/PSS will complete steps 3.1. through 3.3.2.1. In addition, the PST/PSS will
   coordinate with the shop planner and or scheduler to provide the C-ICP manufacturer’s name
   (i.e., Boeing, Lockheed Martin, etc.) in block 2; source of supply (F77, F59, F01, etc.) in
   block 9a; contact information (name, phone number, and fax number) of the person that DLA
   needs to send the P/N request to, along with cost code (see Attachment 13) referenced from
   AFMCI 65-101, Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System-Financial Policy
   and Procedures, and an estimated cost in block 11. NOTE: While there is no materiel
   expense generated on C-ICP provided items, the item record should reflect as accurate a cost
   as possible.
   4.3. The P/N requisition will follow the same process as noted in paragraphs 3.4 and
   paragraph 3.4.1

                                        SMR CODES

A6.1. The SMR code provides maintenance activities with repair-level responsibilities, support
method (i.e., procure, manufacture, etc.), and disposition instructions. SMR codes can be found
in TO 00-25-195.
A6.2. Code Definition:

Table A6.1. Code Definition
 P         Assigned to parts which may be acquired and installed by any activity within the
           authorized scope of maintenance. Code ―P‖ is applied to items which have known
           or expected regular and frequent usage. Service manufacture is allowed for
           immediate support after confirming non-availability from supply sources.
 PD        Assigned to parts which may be acquired and installed by authorized depot-level
           maintenance activities. This code is applied to parts which have known or
           anticipated regular and frequent usage. Emergency service manufacture is
           allowed after conforming non-availability from supply.
 P1        Assigned to parts which may be acquired and installed by an activity within the
           scope of maintenance. This code is applied to parts which have known or
           expected regular and frequent usage. Service manufacture is believed impractical.
 P1D       Assigned to parts which may be acquired and installed by authorized depot-level
           maintenance activities only. Code ―P1D‖ is applied to parts which have known or
           anticipated regular and frequent usage. Service manufacture is impractical.
 P2        Assigned to insurance type items which can be installed by any activity within the
           scope of maintenance. It is applied to parts which have limited and infrequent
           usage. These parts are uneconomical and impractical to manufacture. These items
           are not subject to periodic replacement or frequent wear-out due to equipment
           operation. Infrequent replacement may result from unexpected deterioration,
           mishandling, accidental damage, or other rare occurrences. Long service items are
           also included under this code.
 P2D       Identifies insurance items which may be installed by authorized depot-level
           maintenance only. This code is applied to parts as described under ―P2‖.
 M         Identifies insurance items which can be manufactured and installed within the
           capabilities of intermediate maintenance activities. All of the following must
           apply:
           a. Procurement is not justified because of low usage or peculiar storage and
           installation factors. Needs are to be met by local manufacture only as required.
           b. Manufacture does not require tools, technical data, equipment, or skills not
           normally authorized at the intermediate level of maintenance.
           c. Requires no test equipment other than that normally authorized at the
           intermediate level of maintenance.
           d. Requires no materiel other than that normally available in Air Force inventory.
 M1(M      Identifies parts which can be manufactured at authorized depot-level maintenance
 D)        activities. All the following conditions must apply:
           a. Procurement is not authorized because of low usage or peculiar storage and
309MXWI23-106 9 DECEMBER 2011                                                                      13


          installation factors. The needs of base-level activities are to be met by
          requisitioning from the System Program Director (SPD) or End Article Item
          Manager (EAIM).
          b. Manufacture is beyond the capabilities of intermediate maintenance activities.
          c. Manufacture requires no tools or equipment not normally authorized at depot-
          level maintenance facilities.
A         Assigned to items capable of being assembled at any level of maintenance. This
          code is applied to assemblies consisting of two or more parts, the majority of
          which are purchased or service manufactured.
A1        Identifies items to be assembled at Air Force depot activities only applied to
          assemblies of two or more parts, the majority of which are purchased or service
          manufactured.
X         Applied to main structural part members or similar parts which, if required, would
          suggest extensive repair. The need of an ―X‖ coded item (i.e., wing spares, center
          section structure, etc.), should normally result in recommendation to retire the
          article from service.
X1        Code applies to any level of maintenance and identifies parts for which it is more
          feasible to obtain the next higher assembly. Example; an integral detail part (i.e., a
          welded segment inseparable from the assembly). In some cases, this code may be
          used to indicate an integral part of an assembly which has no anticipated usage and
          was coded ―M‖ or ―MI‖.
X1D       Assigned to parts described under ―X1‖ code but are applicable to authorized
          depot-level maintenance activities only.
X2        Assigned to parts applicable to any level maintenance, which have no anticipated
          usage, and will not be procured or stocked. These items normally require no
          supporting spare parts and service manufacture is considered impractical. Any
          future requirement will be satisfied through reclamation. If unavailable, the item
          will be requisitioned through normal channels with supporting justification. A
          ―repeat‖ requirement will justify an SMR code change to a ―P‖ series if considered
          economical to procure and stock.
X2D       Identifies parts as described under ―X2‖, but applicable to depot-level
          maintenance only. Repeated requirements for such parts shall justify an SMR
          code change as applicable. Any change must be considered economically feasible.
U         Applied to any drawing, instruction sheet, field service drawing, or part number of
          no supply significance. Also includes obsolete parts which cannot be procured,
          stocked, or service manufactured.
F         Identifies kits which are available to all maintenance activities authorized to
          perform intermediate level of repair of the end item.
D         Applied to kits available only to activities authorized to perform depot-level
          maintenance.
KF        Code identifies items which are components of a field parts kit (code ―F‖).
KD        Code assigned to items which are components of a depot parts kit (code ―D‖).
KB        Code identifies items which are components of both the field and depot parts kits.
Note: Items coded ―KD‖, ―KF‖, or ―KB‖ and peculiar to repair kits will not be stocked
separately. Items source coded ―KD‖, ―KF‖, or ―KB‖ and followed by the letter ―P‖, refers
to items normally procured and stocked as ―bulk‖ (i.e., O-rings, seals, bearings, lubricants,
 14                                                      309MXWI23-106 9 DECEMBER 2011


 sealants, etc.). These items are common to both repair kits, as well as other overhaul and/or
 repair applications. Such items will be stocked separately.
A6.3. Source codes are entered in the first and second positions of the uniform SMR coding
format.
A6.4. Source Code Definitions:

Table A6.2. Source Code Definitions
 PA          Item procured and stocked for known or anticipated usage.
 PB          Item procured and stocked for insurance purposes. Essentiality dictates a
             minimum quantity be available in the supply system.
 PC          Item procured and stocked which would otherwise be coded PA, except it is
             deteriorative in nature.
 PE SE       Procured and stocked for initial issue and spares which are designated for specific
             repair activities.
 PF SE       Will not be stocked, but will be procured on demand.
 PG          Item peculiar to the equipment which is procured and stocked to provide sustained
             support. Normally applied to an item which will prove uneconomical to reproduce
             after discontinuance or shut down of production facilities.
 KD          An item of depot overhauls and/or repair kit and not purchased separately. (Depot
             kit is defined as a kit which provides items required at the time of overhaul or
             repair.)
 KF          Identifies an item of a maintenance kit and not purchased separately.
             (Maintenance kit is defined as a kit that provides an item [or items] to be replaced
             at organizational or intermediate levels of maintenance.)
 KB          Item included both depot overhaul and/or repair kit, and maintenance kit.
 Note: Items source coded ―KD‖, ―KF‖, or ―KB‖ and peculiar to repair kits will not be
 stocked separately. Items source coded ―KD‖, ―KF‖, or ―KB‖ and followed by the letter ―P‖
 refers to items which are normally procured and stocked as ―bulk‖ (i.e., O-rings, bearings,
 lubricants, sealants, etc.). These items are common to other repair kits, as well as other
 repair and overhaul applications. Such items will be stocked separately in the appropriate
 commodity class.
 MO          An item to be manufactured or fabricated at the organizational maintenance level.
 MF          An item to be manufactured or fabricated at the intermediate maintenance level.

 AF          Item to be assembled at the intermediate maintenance level.
 AD          Item to be assembled at the depot maintenance level.
 XA          Item is not procured or stocked, because requirement for the item would result in
             the replacement of the next higher assembly.
 XB          Item is not procured or stocked. If not available through salvage, requisition
             through normal supply channels with supporting justification.
 XC          Assigned to installation drawings, diagrams, instruction sheets, field service
             drawings, etc., which are identified by a manufacturer’s part number.
