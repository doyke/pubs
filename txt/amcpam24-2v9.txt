This volume implements AFPD 24-2, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Materiel, and provides
information needed to load plan a portion of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Aircraft discussed in
this volume is the wide-body Airbus A310. Provisions of this volume applies to Active Duty, National
Guard, Military Reserve Units and other government agencies while utilizing commercial aircraft during
contingencies.
This volume of AMCP 24-2 is intended for use as a load planning guide. Equipment listed is dimension-
ally compatible with all Airbus A310 aircraft and cargo areas discussed. Final approval of the procedures
in this publication, however, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DoD. When new or additional information is received from the manufacturer, it will be provided as a
change to this publication.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

The information contained herein is identical to the information in the previous pamphlet broken down
into a more manageable file size. No data has changed. Users of this volume should print volume one
which deals with the Administration, Policies, Specialized Loading Support Equipment, and Passenger,
and Baggage Loading.



1. General Description . The Airbus A310 is a wide-body, long-range, passenger aircraft. The A310 is
normally configured to carry from 191-279 passengers. Variations on passenger seats depend on aircraft
series, location of galley, spacing requirements of the seats, and contract requirements. As of this publica-
tion, there is no cargo conversion of the A310 available for military use. Figure 1. provides general infor-
mation regarding the A310 airbus. For additional information, contact HQ AMC/XOC.

2. Passenger Seating. Passenger configuration and seating capacity vary greatly by aircraft series,
model and individual carrier. The JSCP uses 180 passengers per airplane for the A310 for wartime plan-
ning, based on 400 pounds per individual over a 3,500 nautical mile leg. Figure 2. provides typical seat-
ing arrangements that may be seen on CRAF A310 aircraft. Passenger payload capabilities for the aircraft
are listed in Attachment 2. Users are encouraged to contact the specific contracted carrier to determine
which configuration is to be available for their use.

3. Lower Lobe Compartments. The A310 has three lower lobe compartments: forward lower lobe
(FLL), center lower lobe (CLL), and aft bulk compartment (ABC). The size of these compartments and
access doors vary with aircraft model and series (see Figure 3. for dimensions and capacities). There is no
restraining mechanism available to secure 463L pallets, and the user should plan to bulk load all available
compartments.

4. Loading Sequence. The carrier determines loading sequence for establishing proper center of gravity.
