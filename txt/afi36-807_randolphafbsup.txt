This publication implements and extends the guidance in AFI 36-807, Weekly and Daily
Scheduling of Work and Holiday Observances, 21 June 1999. This supplement establishes and
delegates specific authority to commanders/supervisors of civilian employees to institute various
work schedules for Randolph AFB and its host units.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Compressed work hours have been included as a form of alternative work schedule (AWS) and
the associate units' commanders'/directors' role in approving AWS is clearly defined. Work
schedules in the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) and Headquarters Air Education and
Training Command (HQ AETC) have also been updated.               ⋆ indicates a revision from the
previous edition.

3.2.2. (Added-Randolph AFB) The regular tour of duty for the 12th Flying Training Wing (12
FTW) and associate units is Monday-Friday. Lunch periods will be designated by supervisors.
Supervisors may also grant rest periods according to the criteria listed in paragraph 4.3 of the
basic instruction. The normal hours of duty are as follows:

3.2.2.1. (Added-Randolph AFB) The 12 FTW hours are from 0730-1615 with a 45-minute
lunch period (12th Logistics Group is 0700-1600 with a 1-hour lunch period) unless a flexible or
compressed (5-4-9) schedule with a 1-hour lunch period has been authorized.

3.2.2.2. (Added-Randolph AFB) The Joint Personal Property Shipping Office hours are from
0700-1700--flexible or compressed (5-4-9)--with a 30-minute lunch period.

⋆3.2.2.3. (Added-Randolph AFB) AFPC hours are from 0730-1630 with a 1-hour lunch period
unless a flexible schedule has been approved by directors--flexible from 0600-0900 and 1500-

assigned to the Air Force Recruiting Service and 19th Air Force (19 AF) are encouraged to
pursue physical exercise before, after, or during the duty day. To do this, staff employees may
work a flexible or compressed schedule with starting times between 0600-0900, a midday break
of up to 2 hours for lunch and/or personal time, and ending times between 1600-1900.
Participation is subject to approval by directors, Chiefs of Special Staff, and 19 AF/CC/CV.

present for duty or on authorized leave. A tour of duty must be 8 hours between 0600-1800 on
Monday-Friday. Lunch breaks must be at least 30 minutes and no longer than 2 hours. For
example, core time is 0900-1100 and 1300-1500, and flexible hours are 0600-0900, 1100-1300

⋆3.2.3.2. (Added-Randolph AFB) Prior to implementation of an AWS, requests must be
submitted to the civilian personnel officer to review for compliance with regulatory
requirements. Requests must show justification that flexible or compressed working hours
would improve working conditions, mission accomplishment, employee effectiveness, etc.
Following this review, requests will be forwarded to the 12th Support Group Commander for
final approval for 12 FTW and associate units (AETC directors, Chiefs of Special Staff, 19
AF/CC/CV, and AFPC/CC or designee retain the right to approve/disapprove implementation).

3.2.4 (Added-Randolph AFB) Organizational commanders in the 12 FTW and all associate
unit commanders or designee retain the right to approve/disapprove specific employee requests
for participation:

3.2.4.1. (Added-Randolph AFB) Prior to implementation of alternate workplace arrangements
(AWA), an AWA agreement (see attachment 2 of AFI 36-807) must be submitted to the civilian
personnel officer to review for compliance with regulatory requirements and Air Force guidance.

4.1. To request a special tour of duty of not less than 40 hours in an administrative work week to
permit an employee to take courses at a nearby educational institution, contact the civilian
personnel flight for guidance.

4.3. The 12 FTW/CC, USAF Clinic Commander, and associate unit commanders or designee are
authorized to grant rest periods.

4.3.1. If the time from the beginning of work to lunch is less than 4 hours, a rest period may be
granted only in unusual circumstances. Rest periods will not be continuations of lunch periods
or granted immediately prior to closing time.

4.6. (Added-Randolph AFB) The civilian personnel officer is designated as approving
authority for an uncommon/irregular tour of duty. A request for approval to deviate from the
regular tour of duty to change a basic work week will be submitted in an original and one copy to
12 MSS/DPC, ATTN: Civilian Personnel Officer. A request should be submitted 20 calendar
days prior to the proposed effective date of the change to allow sufficient time for processing the
request and complying with paragraph 4 of the basic instruction (see attachment 4 for sample
format). The following policies will be observed in administering an uncommon/irregular tour
of duty:

4.6.1. (Added-Randolph AFB) When practicable, rotate employees to avoid undue hardship,
to enhance morale, and ensure equity in the payment of night differential and Sunday premium
pay.

4.6.2. (Added-Randolph AFB) Days off will be consecutive, except when a change of tour
makes it impractical.

4.6.3. (Added-Randolph AFB) Changes in tour of duty and duty schedule will not be
accomplished to avoid payment of overtime or holiday premium pay. Conversely, changes will
not be used to intentionally financially reward an employee. An assignment will be made to
meet mission needs without bias or prejudice.

4.6.4. (Added-Randolph AFB) An employee paid under the general schedule whose position
requires him/her to remain at the duty station during longer than regular duty hours and in a
standby status a substantial portion of the time, may be paid additional annual compensation as a
premium pay in lieu of overtime, night differential, Sunday, and holiday pay.

4.7. (Added-Randolph AFB) Daylight Savings Time:

4.7.1. (Added-Randolph AFB) An employee working on a shift when daylight savings time
goes into effect is credited with the actual number of hours worked on that shift. The hour lost as
a result of the change is charged to annual leave, sick leave, leave without pay, compensatory
time, or credit hours, whichever is applicable.

4.7.2. (Added-Randolph AFB) An employee working a shift when the return to standard time
is made is credited with the actual number of hours worked on that shift. Any time worked in
excess of 8 hours is paid at the appropriate overtime rate or compensatory time.

adhere to the applicable guidelines and policies.

2. The employee and organization agree to try the arrangement for at least (specify number)

official duty status at the alternative workplace (e.g., caring for dependents or making home
repairs).
7. The employee’s timekeeper will have a copy of the employee’s AWA schedule. The
employee’s time and attendance will be recorded as performing official duties at the official duty
station. By signing this form, the employee agrees to follow established procedures for
requesting and obtaining approval of leave. NOTE: The organization may require the employee
to complete a self-certification form.

8. The employee will be compensated for overtime work only when it has been approved in
advance in accordance with applicable law and regulation. No overtime work will be performed
without the approval of the supervisor. By signing this form, the employee agrees that failing to
obtain proper approval for overtime work may result in her/his removal from the AWA.

9. If the employee borrows government documents, supplies, or equipment, the employee agrees
to protect them in accordance with governing regulations and use the equipment for official
purposes. The organization agrees to install, service, and maintain any government-owned
equipment issued to the flexiplace employee. The employee agrees to install, service, and
maintain any personal equipment used. The employee will apply safeguards to protect
government records from unauthorized disclosure/damage and comply with Privacy Act of 1974
requirements. The organization agrees to provide the employee with all necessary office
supplies and reimburse the employee for business-related long-distance telephone calls (see
AFI 33-111, Telephone Systems Management, paragraph 7.2, regarding telecommunication
service; and AFI 33-112, Computer Systems Management, paragraph 19.5, regarding computer
equipment in the alternative work site).

agrees to the following security provisions (insert organization-specific language):

11. The employee understands the government will not be liable for damages to an employee’s
personal or real property while the employee is working at the approved alternative workplace,

Personnel and Civilian Employees Claims Act.

12. The employee agrees to provide a work area adequate for the performance of official duties.

13. The employee agrees to permit home inspections by the government of the alternative work
site at periodic intervals during the employee’s normal work hours to ensure proper maintenance
of government property and work site conformance with safety standards (organizations may
require employees to complete a self-certification safety checklist).

14. The employee understands the government will not be responsible for any operating costs
associated with the employee using his/her home as an alternative work site (e.g., home
maintenance, insurance, or utilities). The employee understands he/she does not relinquish any
entitlement to reimbursement for authorized expenses incurred while conducting business for the
AFI36-807_RANDOLPHAFBSUP                3 MARCH 2004                                              7

government as provided by statutes and regulations.

15. Any accident or injury occurring at the alternate work site must be brought to the immediate
attention of the supervisor. Because an employment-related accident sustained by an AWA
employee may occur outside the premises of the official duty station, the supervisor must
investigate all reports immediately following notification.

16. The employee is covered under the Federal Employee’s Compensation Act if injured in the
course of performing official duties at the official or alternate duty station.

17. Work requirements are developed as a joint effort between the employee and supervisor, but
the supervisor makes the final decision about requirements. The employee agrees to complete all
assigned work according to procedures established by the supervisor, and guidelines and
standards in the employee’s performance plan. The employee agrees to provide regular reports if
required by the supervisor to help judge performance. The employee understands that a decline
in performance may be grounds for canceling the AWA.

18. The employee agrees to limit performance to officially assigned duties at his/her official
duty station or the government-approved alternate duty station. Failure to comply with this
provision may result in loss of pay, termination of the AWA, and/or other appropriate
disciplinary action.

19. The employee agrees he/she is bound by government and organizational standards of
conduct while working at the alternative work site.

20. The employee agrees to protect government and organizational records from unauthorized
disclosure/damage and comply with requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a.

21. All appropriate bargaining obligations have been or will be met prior to implementing this
agreement.

22. Nothing in this agreement precludes the organization from taking appropriate disciplinary or
adverse action against an employee who fails to comply with the provisions of this agreement.

23. The employee or supervisor may terminate participation at anytime. The organization
agrees to let the employee resume his/her regular schedule at the regular office after notice to the
supervisor. The employee understands the organization may cancel the flexiplace arrangement
and instruct the employee to resume working at the regular office. The organization agrees to
follow any applicable administrative or negotiated procedures.
