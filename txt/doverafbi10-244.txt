SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
instruction supersedes DoverAFBI 10-1001, Support to Civil and Foreign Aircraft Using Dover
AFB, 27 December 2003, which superseded DoverAFB Regulation 400-1 Logistics Support of
Foreign Military, Foreign Government, and All Civil Aircraft Not Under Contract to the U.S.
Government, 8 October 1986. Changes reflected in this document address Air Force Auditing
Agency (AFAA) “Landing Cost Fee Management Findings” requiring additional emphasis to
correct a lack of unit level tracking, accounting and reimbursement request submissions.
Guidance is also provided on baseline support termed “Customary or First Line” which is not
normally reimbursable, AF inventory equipment/supplies issue IAW AMC ACSA policy and a
means to capture, track and report expenses.
1. General. Foreign aircraft land at DoverAFB on a continual basis for a multitude of reasons.
While on-station these aircraft receive logistical services and support from various units and
agencies. The service and support provided may or may not be reimbursable. Regardless, the
cost of providing support or services needs to be tracked and documented to support unit
budgetary forecasting or to request reimbursement.
    1.1. Purpose. This document identifies wing/base unit responsibilities, guidance and
    procedures applicable to documentation required to account for and request reimbursement
    of support provided to foreign aircraft using DoverAFB.
    1.2. Application. There are three units in the wing that normally provide services and
    support to foreign aircraft: 436 Aerial Port Squadron (APS), 436 Logistical Readiness
    Squadron (LRS) and 436 Avionics Maintenance Squadron (AMXS). In order to accurately
    bill for service and support provided by the AF, units must account for manpower, equipment
    authorizations and maintenance support provided to foreign aircraft and aircrew.
2. Requirements and Services. All support and service provided will be accomplished using
pertinent International Agreements, Department of Defense (DoD, DD when referencing forms),
AF and AMC guidance, policies and procedures.
    2.1. Reimbursable support and services include, but are not limited to:
       2.1.1. Aviation Fuel.
       2.1.2. Billeting.
       2.1.3. AF Inventory parts, equipment and supplies.
    2.2. STANAG 3113, Annex A: Provides the basis for non-reimbursable, reciprocal
    logistical support to NATO member country aircraft approved to land at DoverAFB. It also
    identifies current NATO member countries.
       2.2.1. Reciprocal support provided to foreign aircraft that is considered “normal, first
       line, traditional, or customary” include:
           2.2.1.1. Ground Handling Equipment.
DOVERAFBI10-244 6 JANUARY 2010                                                                   3


          2.2.1.2. Passenger and cargo off/on loading, excluding pallet build-up.
          2.2.1.3. Movement of aircrew between aircraft, billeting and aircraft.

while providing services or support to foreign aircraft approved to land at DoverAFB. Unit
commanders (CCs), will ensure service or support is provided as indicated in the Aircraft
Landing Authorization Number (ALAN).

       enhance the unit capability to forecast budgetary requirements.
       4.2.3. Functional areas will maintain a record of support provided by ALAN for one
