             CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN

PART I
Preface
1. A thoroughly trained, motivated enlisted workforce is the Air Force's key resource in
meeting challenges of the future. The Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) for
AFSC 1T0X1, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Specialist, provides
management with the life-cycle education/training framework and guidance necessary for
planning, developing, managing, and conducting career field education and training programs. It
provides a training guide for the career field that identifies mandatory and optional skill level
training received during career progression. This CFETP identifies the specific training
individuals receive during each phase of their career. This plan will provide personnel a clear
path to success, instill rigor in all aspects of career field training, and train today's workforce for
tomorrow's jobs. Ensure that all records, created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication, are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS)
Records     Disposition       Schedule       (RDS)      located      at   https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/.
2. The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan are used by supervisors to plan,
manage, and control training within the career field:
2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of training in the career field.
It contains administrative details, general information on purpose, use, and approval of the
CFETP, career field progression, skill level training requirements, and resource constraints.
2.2. Part II of the CFETP contains the Specialty Training Standard (STS), Training Course
Index, and Command Unique Requirements (replaces Air Force or Command Job Qualification
Standards). MAJCOMs may submit attachments to the CFETP in Part II, Section B, Command
Unique Requirements, to accomplish the objectives of previously command written and
disseminated Command Job Qualification Standards (CJQS) or command directed requirements
not fulfilled by the Specialty Training Standard (STS) in Part II, Section A. Supervisors and
trainers at the unit level will use Part II of the CFETP to identify, plan, and conduct unit level
training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.
3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals, in this specialty, receive
effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable us to
train today’s workforce for tomorrow’s jobs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use
Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

Computer-Based Training (CBT). The use of computers to aid in the delivery and management
of instruction.
Core Task. Identifies the minimum qualification requirement for all personnel within an AFS,
regardless of duty position. MFMs (MAJCOM Functional Managers) provide a comprehensive
list of minimum qualification task requirements, by skill level, or in general across the AFS to
the AFCFM (Air Force Career Field Manager).
Critical Tasks. Tasks, which have been identified by the work center supervisor, as having a
detrimental effect on mission accomplishment if not performed correctly. Critical tasks may or
may not be the same as core tasks, but are mandatory if identified as ―critical‖ to the individual’s
position by the supervisor or work center.
Distance Learning (DL). Training that is exported, such as from a resident course, to a field
location for trainees to complete without the on-site support of the formal school instructor.

Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW). A forum to develop a CFETP that identifies:
(1) life cycle education and training requirements, (2) training support resources, and
(3) minimum task requirements for a specialty. The CFETP aims to give personnel a clear career
path and instills a sense of industry in career field training.
Section A – General Information

1. Purpose of the CFETP. The CFETP is the primary document used to identify life-cycle
education and training requirements. It serves as a road map for career progression and outlines
requirements that must be satisfied at appropriate points throughout the career path. The CFETP
also specifies that mandatory task qualification requirements for award and maintenance of an
AFSC. Deployment/UTC (unit type code) task requirements can be identified with a symbol to
assist Commanders in prioritizing training. Use the CFETP to plan, conduct, evaluate, and
document training:
1.1. Civilian CFETPs must meet all development requirements as enlisted or officer.
1.2. Special Duty Identifier (SDI) and Reporting Identifier (RI) CFETPs are developed, if
required, by the AFCFM.
1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the
training delivery.
1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that affect implementation of the desired CFETP.
2. Use of the CFETP. This plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors, at all levels, to ensure
comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available to each individual in the specialty:
2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, nonresident, field, and
exportable training courseware based upon requirements established by the users and
documented in Part II of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM to develop
acquisition strategies for obtaining the resources needed to provide the identified training.
2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
upgrade, and proficiency requirements. Identified requirements may be satisfied by OJT, formal
training, contract training, or exportable courses. MAJCOM-developed training, to support this
AFSC, must be identified for inclusion in this plan by MAJCOM JQS (Job Qualification
Standards) and must not duplicate other available training resources.
2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.
The lists of courses, in Part II, will be used as a reference to support training as required.
3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM
representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field
training requirements. The CFETP will be reviewed annually by the AFCFM to ensure it is
accurate and current, assess whether the AFS has undergone any mission or role related changes,
                                               7
and as a result, if a U&TW is necessary. The review will also satisfy the annual certification
requirements of AFI 33-360 V1, Publications and Forms Management.
4. Waiver Authority for Mandatory Requirements. IAW AFI 36-2201 V2, Air Force
Training Program Training Management, and AFI 36-2201 V5, Air Force Training Program
Career Field Education and Training, the AFCFM is the waiver approval authority for
mandatory training, experience, and education listed in the official specialty description
referenced in Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). Waiver requests must be
approved by the MFM prior to review by the AFCFM. See AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military
Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), Table 3.3., for specific procedures of processing requests.
Waiving any portion of an established standard requires an in-depth consideration on how it will
affect the AF mission, the specialty, and the individual:
4.1. The AFCFM is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the specialty. When evaluating
waiver requests the AFCFM must remember that established mandatory requirements were
justified and validated using MAJCOM functional inputs. The only waivers that should be
approved are ones that contain an equivalent substitute for the requirement. Any review should
compare the waiver request against predetermined standards to ensure the integrity of the
specialty is maintained. A review should also consider the trainee’s task knowledge and
performance, capability in relation to mission requirements, ability to learn and transfer this
knowledge to performance to meet mission needs and future needs within the specialty equal to
peers.

6.5.3. Following the MR training period, SERE Specialist Journeymen are qualified for PCS or
deployment. MR Journeymen may attend advanced parachuting courses to prepare them to
conduct, supervise, and manage SERE parachuting operations.
6.5.4. ANG and AFRC SERE Specialist Journeymen will follow the 1T0X1 MR training plan
as developed by the SERE AFCFM.
6.5.5. MR Journeymen should be encouraged to continue their pursuit of higher education.
6.6. Craftsman Level (7):
6.6.1. Award of the 7-Skill Level requires selection for promotion to Staff Sergeant, completion
of J5ACP1T071-0S7A, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Craftsman Course,
and a minimum of 12 months in UGT (upgrade training) (individuals in retraining status are
subject to the same requirements). Craftsmen may fill various line, supervisory, and staff
positions throughout the Air Force SERE program.
6.6.2. Craftsmen should attend advanced parachuting courses to prepare them to conduct,
supervise, and manage SERE parachuting operations.
6.6.3. Craftsmen should take courses or obtain knowledge on management of resources and
personnel. Craftsmen should be encouraged to continue their pursuit of higher education.
6.6.4. Craftsmen should attend Air Operations Center Initial Qualification Training (AOCIQT)
or its equivalent in order to support JPRCs (Joint Personnel Recovery Centers), AOCs (air
operations centers), and warfighting HQs (headquarters). This fulfills the formal training
requirement for Special Experience Identifier (SEI) 901.
6.6.5. Craftsmen should attend Nonconventional Assisted Recovery Plans and Operations
course (PR 303): This provides SERE Specialist the qualification to operate in a UARCC.
6.7. Superintendent Level (9):
6.7.1. To be awarded AFSC 1T091, an individual must meet the requirements in AFI 36-2101
and AFI 36-2108. A 9-level will be expected to fill positions such as SERE functional manager,
superintendent, or other staff positions. Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower,
resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education.
Additional higher education and completion of courses outside their AFSC are recommended.
7. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 1T0X1 career field. The spectrum
                                               11
includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. A Training
Planning Team (TPT) was conducted, in February-March 2010, to provide suggestions to the
April 2010 U&TW. The training decisions reflected in this part of the CFETP are the results of
the April 2010 SERE Specialist Career Field U&TW. The U&TW accepted the following for the
1T0 career field.
7.1. Changes to STS format:
7.1.1. Proficiency code columns were realigned to capture current and future career field
requirements; the 3-Skill Level was adjusted to reflect attainable levels-of-learning. 5-Skill Level
learning levels now reflect instructor duties associated with mandatory assignment to the
336 TRG for field training certification. Mission Ready Training column was changed to
Mission Ready Course to reflect current training and operational mission requirements. The
intent of the course is to ensure standardized training is accomplished at the three to four year
TIS (time-in-service) point for career airmen. The purpose is to prepare 1T051s to meet current
and future operational needs of DoD and AF MAJCOMs. 7-Skill Level was adjusted to reflect
management of SERE training, operational support and exercise management, the 7-Level OJT
column was removed.
7.1.2. The Core Task column was removed from the STS, Part II and no core tasks were
identified for the career field. The reason is that all tasks are met and evaluated through formal
courses conducted at the 336 TRG, Fairchild AFB, and there is no requirement to identify these
for base level OJT instruction.
7.1.3. The ―Previous 3-Level training events‖ column was deleted. Course identifiers were built
into previous CFETP versions because no formal syllabi existed. Currently all prerequisite
requirements are identified and fulfilled through formal course syllabi.
7.2. Initial Skills (Helper) Level (1):
7.2.1. SSS shifted task organization from 2 AF to 19 AF effective 1 July 2010. OPCON has
been assigned to 22 TRS Det 2 and the course has been designated as S-V70-A, SERE Specialist
Selection (SSS). Although the original intent of SSS has not changed, the change in OPCON will
give the career field more effective control over the selection process.
7.3. Apprentice Level (3):
7.3.1. S-V81-A resistance training was changed from three post-graduate exercises, intended to
measure task performance in captivity, to a single PTE. Training was shifted to focus on higher
levels-of-learning in resistance TTP (tactics, techniques, and procedures) task knowledge and
higher knowledge levels of U.S. policy.
7.3.2. AFCFM will pursue equivalency for courses PR 102, Introduction to PR, SERE 271,
Specialized SERE Training, and SERE 250A, Specialized SERE Training.
7.3.3. A2 Program: AFS will continue to use MACP (Modern Army Combatives Program)
certification(s) as a baseline for A2 until equivalency is built and vetted at Headquarter Air Force
(HAF).
7.4. Journeyman Level (5):
7.4.1. Apprentices will attend AETC course S-V87-B, SERE Specialist Journeyman Arctic
Survival Training, in a class(es) set aside by AETC/A3ZA specifically for the career field.
7.4.2. Modern Army Combatives Program Level 2 (MACP-2) or equivalent is required for
5-Skill Level upgrade.

                                                12
7.4.3. AFCM will seek equivalency for SERE 250F, Specialized SERE Training.




                                           13
7.5. SERE Specialist 5-Level Mission Ready (MR) Course:
7.5.1. Change in the Air Force SERE Program from an initial training focus to fulfilling the
SERE Program triad of formal training, refresher training, and SERE operations has resulted in a
need to provide a SERE Specialist trained beyond 5-Skill Level requirements to perform
missions outside the 336 TRG.
7.5.2. This course focuses on operating stand-alone programs and wartime requirements. This
will be accomplished through mission planning laboratories, a PRCC exercise, increased subject
knowledge concerning U.S. policy for captivity in support of Conduct After Capture (SS03)
Refresher Training. Additionally, Wilderness Advanced First Aid recertification will be
conducted at this time.
7.5.3. AFCFM will seek equivalency for PR 300, PR Execution, SERE 296/297 Reintegration
Team Responsibilities/PR Debriefing.
7.5.4. A captivity PTE was inserted upon completion of advanced CoC (Code of Conduct) and
U.S. policy in the SERE Specialist 5-Level Mission Ready Course. This provides a better
assessment of SERE Specialist captivity TTP capabilities and supports resistance instruction in
support of SS03.
7.6. Craftsman Level (7):
7.6.1. The focus of the course is managing SERE training, operational support, and exercise
management. Practical experience in the tropics, desert, captivity and urban environments was
retained, relevant, and valuable.
7.6.2. AFCFM will seek equivalency for PR 301, PR Plans and Operations.
8. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). CCAF accreditation is based on the Criteria
for Accreditation of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) Commission of
Colleges. Accreditation held by the CCAF system will apply to a school and its courses that
contribute to the CCAF degree.
8.1. Occupational Instructor Certification. Program for qualified instructors who teach CCAF
collegiate-level courses at CCAF affiliated schools (S-V81-A, SERE Specialist Training). The
purpose of the certification is to recognize instructors’ extensive faculty development training,
education, and qualifications required to teach accredited CCAF course(s) and formally
acknowledge instructors’ practical teaching experience. Qualified officer, enlisted, civilian and
other service instructors are eligible for this certification. To qualify the instructor must be
assigned to course S-V81-A, SERE Specialist Training, and meet requirements identified on the

Military Studies is through attendance at an Airman Leadership School, NCO Academy, and/or
the Air Force Senior NCO Academy. It is strongly encouraged that SERE Specialists also
attempt to attend civilian courses that emphasize fundamentals of leadership and management of
human and material resources.
8.2.2. General Education (15 Semester Hours): This requirement is satisfied college attendance,
by application of courses accepted in transfer, or by testing credit. Specific requirements are
identified on the Community College of the Air Force website: www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf/.
8.2.3. Additional off-duty education is a personal choice that is encouraged for all. Individuals
desiring to become an AETC Instructor should be actively pursuing an associate’s degree. A
degreed faculty is necessary to maintain accreditation through the Southern Association of
Colleges and Schools.

Section D – Resource Constraints
11. Purpose. This section identifies known resource constraints, which preclude optimal/desired
training from being developed or conducted, including time, manpower, experience, and cost. A
narrative explanation of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect
each constraint has on training are included. Also, included in this section are actions required,
office of primary responsibility, and target completion date. Resource constraints will be, as a
minimum, reviewed and updated annually:
11.1. Constraints:
11.1.1. 80 training billets annually have been requested from JPRA (Joint Personnel Recovery
Agency) for the following courses: SERE 250, SERE 260, SERE 271, PR 296/297, PR 300, and
PR 301. JPRA is currently unable to meet these AFS upgrade requirements for any of the listed
courses. Nonavailability of seats within these courses results in delays in upgrade training and
inability to meet MAJCOM operational requirements. AFCFM will continue to request training

                                               19
allocations and will concurrently seek course equivalencies.
11.1.2. 80 funded training billets were requested per year for course L5AZA1T231. This
identifier was incorrect and has been changed to L9AQA1XXXX-0A1A, US Army Basic
Airborne Course, through AETC/A3ZA and approved through AETC/A2/3. Awaiting
administrative action to confer authorized training billets.
11.1.3. 336 TRG is tasked to qualify 80 SERE Specialists per year to deploy the emergency
parachute. Jump billets, equipment, air support, ARMS (Automated Records Management
System) personnel, and Aircrew Flight Equipment Specialist support at Fairchild are insufficient
to meet this requirement. 336 TRG/CC/CD/CCM currently seeking resources to meet
requirement.
11.1.4. A new SERE Specialist 5-Level Mission Ready Course was identified to meet SERE
Specialist MAJCOM and operational support requirements, and to provide equivalent training
for PR courses that are currently constrained. New requirements beyond skill level upgrade, will
require additional training and resources. Course resource estimate will determine constraints.
11.1.5. Implementation of STS line items in this document requires a new 5-Level Mission
Ready course, significant changes to resistance training throughout career field development, a
complete rewrite of the SERE 7-Level course, and significant changes to the 3-Level training
course. 336 TRSS/DOT cannot meet the 120-day suspense directed by this document based on
current manning. Until all manpower issues are resolved, the 336 TRG will establish courseware
project priorities by collaborating with HQ AETC.
PART II
Section A – Specialty Training Standard
1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes
starting NLT 120 days after signature/approval.
2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201 V3, Air Force Training Program on the Job
Training Administration, this STS:
2.1. Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References. Lists in column 1, the tasks, knowledge, and
technical references (TRs) necessary for airmen to perform in the corresponding skill
level/course identified in columns 3A – 3D, These are based on an analysis of the duties in Air
Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). The TRs listed in a header block indicate that
the same TRs are used for all sub-tasks listed below that header.
2.2. Formal training requirements:
2.2.1. Column ―3A‖ identifies the levels-of-learning required for graduation from course
S-V81-A, SERE Specialist Training, course (3-Skill Level) and award of the 1T031.
2.2.2. Column ―3B‖ identifies the levels-of-learning to meet 5-Level upgrade requirements and
award of the 1T051. Line items will be accomplished while assigned to 22 TRS/CPF in OJT
training or formal courses identified as upgrade requirements by the AFECD.
2.2.3. Column ―3C‖ identifies the MAJCOM and operational support requirements of the
1T051. Line items will be accomplished during the new SERE Specialist 5-Level Mission Ready
Course. Completion required prior to deployment or PCS/PCA from the 336 TRG.
2.2.4. Column ―3D‖ identifies levels-of-learning required for graduation from J5ACP1T071-
0S7A, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Craftsman Course.
2.3. Required training levels. SERE Specialist personnel are trained in unit OJT and formal
                                               20
courses for skill level upgrade. Circle current duty position task number. If in upgrade training,
all duty position requirements, to include tasks commensurate with the skill level in training for,
will be identified. After an individual has completed upgrade training and has received their new
skill level, only the tasks that are specific to their duty position will be required to be maintained
and identified. All remaining task numbers that are circled and are no longer required for an
individual’s duty position, will have the circles erased. Personnel that are not trained to the
appropriate skills task levels, or who fail to maintain standards, or who are downgraded should
be entered into remedial training. Unit commanders should review records and pertinent
information on personnel who fail to maintain standards after remedial training for removal from
the career field. Requests for waivers to a skill training level are discouraged, but are coordinated
through the MAJCOM SERE MFM for approval recommendation or final disapproval. Waiver
requests with an approval recommendation are forwarded to the AFCFM for a final decision.
2.4. OJT certification columns. Column 2 provides OJT certification columns to record
completion of task and knowledge training requirements. Certification is accomplished as
outlined in AFI 36-2201 V3.
2.5. Training Standard. Becomes a job qualification standard for OJT, when placed on
AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201 V3. For OJT,
the tasks in column 2B are trained and qualified to the identified level-of-learning and means the
individual can perform the task and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and
correct use of procedures for the listed knowledge and/or skill task level.
2.6. Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) and Specialty Knowledge Test (SKT). The
CFETP is also a guide for development of promotion tests used in the WAPS. Specialty
Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by
Senior NCOs, with extensive practical experience in their career fields based on STS subject
matter areas. Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual
responsibilities are in Chapter 1, paragraph 1.19 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Personnel Testing
System.
2.7. Upgrade Certification Procedures. Prior to upgrade, all 1T0X1 personnel, regardless of
duty position, must satisfactorily complete 1T0X1 Career Knowledge training commensurate
with upgrade skill level. Trainees must also meet AFSC experience requirements outlined in Air
Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) and be task certified on 5-Level or 7-level
tasks. Work center supervisors may not defer selected tasks without MFM approval and AFCFM
waiver to training policy. Deferment actions will be coordinated with the unit training office,
MFM, and AFCFM. Work centers may add local upgrade mandatory and non-mandatory tasks.
Continue to accomplish completion of non-mandatory tasks pertinent to the units, as tasks
become available for training.
2.8. Post-Graduate Evaluation. Following completion of course S-V81-A, all graduates and
their supervisors must accomplish the written "Post-Graduate Evaluation" within a 90 to 150 day
window. 336 TRSS/DOT will provide the post-graduate evaluations to supervisors and
graduates. Results of the graduate evaluation will be forwarded to HQ USAF/A30S and
HQ AETC/A3ZA within a 180 to 225 day window following course completion.
3. Records Documentation.
3.1. Identification. Enter trainee's and supervisor’s/trainer’s identification data on the JQS
identification page.



                                                 21
3.2. Certification. Certify tasks as follows ensuring all annotations are in pencil:
3.2.1. Circle current duty position task number. If in upgrade training, all duty position
requirements, to include tasks commensurate with the skill level in training for, will be
identified. After an individual has completed upgrade training and has received their new skill
level, only the tasks that are specific to their duty position will be required to be maintained and
identified. All remaining task numbers, that are circled and are no longer required for an
individuals’ duty position, will have the circles erased.
3.2.2. As task training starts, enter the training start date in column ―2A.‖
3.2.3. If a task is listed as remove/install or has more than one noun or verb, and training cannot
be completed on the entire task, circle the noun or verb that applies.
3.2.4. When the trainee and trainer agree to task proficiency, the trainee will initial the trainee
block (column ―2C‖). The trainer will enter completion date in column ―2B‖ and will initial in
the trainer block (column ―2D‖).
3.3. Decertification. To decertify an individual, who is no longer proficient at a required task,
"X" out the "completion date" block and erase the start date, trainer, certifier and trainee's
initials. Annotate AF IMT 623A, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, to reflect the
reason for decertification.
3.4. Recertification. Once retraining is started, enter the new training start date. After
completing the task to a "go" level, recertify following procedures in paragraph 3.2.
3.5. Transcribing CFETPs. Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative
function, not a re-evaluation of training. For tasks previously certified and required in the current
duty position, circle the subparagraph number next to the task statement and enter the current
date in the completion column. Trainee initials in the trainee column and the current task certifier
or supervisor/trainer initials in the trainer column. Remember, during the transcription process no
training is taking place; therefore, the trainer’s initial are not required when transcribing previous
certification for tasks not required in the current duty position, carry forward only the previous
completion date of certification (not the initials of another person). If and when transcribed tasks
become duty position requirements, recertify using standard certification procedures. The person
whose initials appear in the trainer or certifier block, during the transcription process, must meet
the requirements of their respective roles. Upon completion of the transcription process, give the
old CFETP to the member.

Section E – MAJCOM Unique Requirements

1. Guidance from HQ USAF/DPPE during development of the 1T0X1 CFETP precludes the
use of MAJCOM directed Job Qualification Standards (JQS) or Command Job Qualification
Standards (CJQS). The purpose of the CFETP is to provide one "cradle to grave" document to
manage training of personnel in the SERE Specialist career field. However, recognizing
MAJCOMs may have command unique training requirements, MAJCOMs may identify
command unique requirements or attachments to this section. The requirements or attachments in
this section of the CFETP accomplish the objectives of any previous command written and
disseminated CJQS. They will also ensure proper training of their personnel to meet command or
mission requirements not fulfilled by the Specialty Training Standard (STS) in Part II, Section A.
2. MAJCOMs will review command unique training requirements during the annual CFETP
review and submit any desired changes to the Career Field Manager for review and approval. If
an STS supplemental attachment is required, MAJCOMs will list requirements over and above
the STS requirements listed in Part II, Section A, in STS format.
