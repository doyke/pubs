1. Legal Issues. This instruction outlines procedures and determinations of accidents and abuse.
It does not determine personal negligence nor does it assess personal financial liability. These
issues must be handled in accordance with AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force
Property. Unit commanders may use the Report of Survey process in conjunction with an
accident or abuse investigation as a tool for the determination of liability in an accident or abuse
allegation. The
56 LRS will not assess pecuniary liability or assign fault. Fault will be determined by the using
organization’s commander.
2. Definitions.
     2.1. Vehicle accident. Any collision, impact, or abrasion against a fixed or moving object,
     with a government-owned vehicle that causes damage, whether immediately noticeable or
     not.
     2.2. Vehicle abuse. Vehicle abuse is normally considered damage caused by willful or
     negligent acts of improper operation or care. AFI 23-302, paragraph 1.20. Abuses are to

        2.2.1. Failure to accomplish operator maintenance.
        2.2.2. Not reporting malfunctions, defects, accident damage, or safety discrepancies
        affecting vehicle condition to Vehicle Management (56 LRS/LGRV) in a timely manner.
        Safety issues must be reported immediately of identification and all other discrepancies
        must be turned in within 24 hours of identification. Vehicle operators record
        maintenance discrepancies as they perform inspections, or when discovered. Operators
        record discrepancies in the appropriate section of the applicable Operator’s Inspection
        Guide and Trouble Report, to be reported to Vehicle Management within one normal
        workday. Operators do not delay discrepancy reporting on systems or devices adversely
        affecting the safety of personnel or the operation of vehicles/equipment. When any of the
        discrepancies listed below are identified, the operator will discontinue use of the vehicle
        and report the discrepancy to Vehicle Management as soon as possible. Note: If the
        discrepancy occurs outside Vehicle Management Duty hours, discontinue vehicle use and
        notify Vehicle Management of discrepancy the next duty day. AFI 23-302, paragraphs
        10.7.7 and 3.13.2.2.
        2.2.3. Tampering with speed governors or pollution control devices.
        2.2.4. Operating a vehicle with improperly inflated tires not in accordance with
        manufacturer’s recommendation or excessive tire wear, resulting in cords being exposed.

       the painted finish (prevent oxidation), but do not wax vehicles with flat or Chemical
       Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) finishes. Vehicle management will not accept dirty
       vehicles. If excessively dirty vehicles are towed in, the using organization should clean
       the vehicle prior to being accepted in the CSC. AFI 32-302, paragraph 3.13.3.

       Weather conditions are acceptable unavoidable circumstances.
3. Responsibilities.
   3.1. Objectives. The objective of this instruction is to provide 56 FW personnel with a
   comprehensive program to extend the service life of assigned vehicle assets. The overall
   responsibility for managing vehicle training and daily inspections rests with each squadron
   commander and designated VCO/VCNCO.
       3.1.1. All suspected vehicle accident and abuse cases will be repaired by local vendor

   tracking, and repair of accident and abuse damage are the responsibility of 56 LRS/LGRV.
