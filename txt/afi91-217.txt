SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
primarily involve the removal of large amounts of purely descriptive non-directive material
deemed non-essential for the purposes of an Air Force Instruction. For simplicity, this revision
combines Chapter 3 and Chapter 2 of the previous revision, and incorporates the relevant
portions of Chapter 8 into Chapter 6. This revision also deletes Chapters 7 and 9 of the previous
version.

This revision combines the Spacecraft Space Debris Assessment Report (SDAR) and the
Spacecraft End-of-Life Plan (EOLP) into a single document whose content and format is
described in Attachment 3. The Launch Vehicle Space Debris Assessment Report, described in
Attachment 2, is still submitted separately. Publication consistently denotes casualty expectation
(Ec).

                                             Chapter 1

                                  SPACE SAFETY PROGRAM

1.1. Scope.
     1.1.1. This document implements Space Safety and Space Mishap Prevention guidance for
     all Air Force space systems throughout all system life cycle phases.
     1.1.2. Purpose. The Air Force operates responsibly with due regard for the safety of the
     general public, Air Force personnel, space support personnel, and public and government
     resources. This document provides overarching Space Safety and Space Mishap Prevention
     guidance for acquisition, testing, and life cycle operations of terrestrial, launch, and orbital
     space systems.
     1.1.3. Applicability. This instruction is applicable to all Air Force organizations that
     develop, test, or operate any space system, or who provide launch/range services for space
     systems. This includes space systems under development, research and development systems,
     experimental systems, systems undergoing testing, operational systems, and systems at end-
     of-life (EOL). This instruction is applicable to the entire mission if the Air Force is the lead
     launching, manufacturing, or operating agency. For missions where the Air Force is not the
     lead launching, manufacturing, or operating agency, this instruction is applicable for all
     segments under Air Force control.
        1.1.3.1. Mission Partner Responsibilities. All participating organizations within a
        mission partnership should establish Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) or
        Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) outlining each organization’s responsibilities
        and requirements with regard to Space Safety and Mishap Prevention.
        1.1.3.2. Joint/DoD/Non-DoD Space Safety Guidelines. Organizations operating in a joint
        environment or with non-DoD agencies should develop MOAs/MOUs that specify the
        applicable space safety guidelines. It is the participating organizations’ responsibilities to
        determine the lead agency and proper approval authorities. Consult with Numbered Air
        Force (NAF) and MAJCOM/SE, as appropriate.
        1.1.3.3. Existing Systems. This instruction does not require modification of existing
        space systems and system upgrades that have completed their System Requirements
        Review prior to Feb 2010, nor does it require demonstration of compliance with
        requirements in this AFI that did not apply to those systems prior to that time. However,
        consistent with cost effectiveness and mission requirements, adhere to any aspect of this
        instruction that can be met without significant analysis or design change. When feasible,
        apply the updated requirements in this document to any future documentation, design
        changes, or system modifications required. Qualitative information indicating that
        existing systems meet the intent of the requirement(s) may be used to demonstrate an
        equivalent level of safety. Note: compliance with requirements sourced from previously
        published documents (e.g., orbital debris mitigation requirements in DoDI 3100.12, 14
        Sept 2000) is still mandatory
     1.1.4. Terminology. This instruction uses the term "appropriate Wing Commander/System
     Program Office (SPO) Director” throughout. Therefore, MAJCOMs will identify the
AFI91-217 11 APRIL 2014                                                                         5


   appropriate Wing Commander/SPO Director in their supplements to this instruction and will
   specify when safety responsibility transfers between organizations. The SPO is the office of
   the Program Manager (PM) and the single point of contact with industry, government
   agencies, and other activities participating in the system acquisition process.
   1.1.5. Waivers. When complying with official policy, guidance and/or procedures designated
   with a Tier Waiver Authority number, the unit may request a waiver IAW AFI 33-360,
   Publications and Forms Management. Refer to AFI 33-360 Tier Waiver Authority number

   safety throughout design, development, integration and test, and shipment to the launch or
   operational location.
   3.1.2. Design decisions have the potential to impact the operational safety of a system.
   Therefore, the acquisition organization shall address the impact of design decisions on the
   launch, on-orbit, reentry, and disposal/EOL requirements in this document during acquisition
   phases. Acquisition organizations shall comply with all safety standards that address these
   downstream risks. The acquisition organization is also responsible for all of its follow-on
   sustainment activities.
   3.1.3. Where risk responsibilities overlap organizations, all mission partners shall refer to the
   MOAs/MOUs described in Section 1 for risk responsibility guidelines.

   discipline, readiness reviews, and test execution risk management) and configuration control
   in order to minimize mishaps. (T-3)
3.4. Transportation.
   3.4.1. Plan and execute the transportation of high-value and/or hazardous space systems to
   minimize hazards posed to and by the space system.
   3.4.2. The responsible Air Force SPO Director shall develop and approve a transportation
   plan (or equivalent document) for transportation from the factory to the operational site or
   range. The receiving Wing Commander/SPO Director, if any, shall coordinate on the plan.
   (T-3)
3.5. Assembly and Checkout.
   3.5.1. Safety responsibility for assembly and checkout is normally the responsibility of the
   SPO Director or equivalent acquiring the system. If the potential hazards from this sub-phase
   can extend beyond the boundaries of the involved facility, the installation commander is
   responsible for the protection of other resources and personnel. After operational capability
   certification, the operational Wing Commander assumes operational safety responsibility. All
   mission partners shall refer to the MOAs/MOUs described in Section 1 for risk responsibility
   guidelines.
3.6. Personnel and Resource Protection.
   3.6.1. Consistent with Commercial Space Operations Support Agreements and other local
   agreements, Space Safety Programs shall incorporate designs to protect Air Force personnel
   and the general public from accidental death, injury, and/or occupational illness and protect
   Air Force systems, equipment, material, and facilities in the launch area from damage or
   delayed operation as a result of space related operations. (T-3)
   3.6.2. When the Air Force enters into a contract or written agreement transferring use of a
   facility to another organization, the responsibility for personnel and resource protection is
   simultaneously transferred, upon host safety approval.

                                           Chapter 4

                                LAUNCH & RANGE SAFETY

4.1. Pre-Launch, Launch, and Reentry.
   4.1.1. This chapter outlines safety responsibilities and tasks for pre-launch processing at the
   launch site, launch operations, and the reentry of launch vehicle components or reentry
   vehicles. It includes safety responsibilities and requirements for launch vehicles/components,
   reentry vehicles/components, controlled reentry, and reusable launch vehicles/components,
   including their jettisoned components. For on-orbit disposal safety responsibilities and
   requirements for spacecraft or launch vehicle components that remain in orbit, see Section 5.
   4.1.2. The Space Wing shall ensure each range user complies with all Air Force
   launch/range safety requirements levied upon them as a condition of Air Force range use. (T-
   3)
       4.1.2.1. FAA-licensed launches from Air Force ranges are also subject to the
       requirements of other agencies, including FAA/AST (FAA Office of Commercial Space
       Transportation). Use established agreements for ensuring safety compliance for FAA-
       licensed launches.
       4.1.2.2. In some cases, agreements with local governments or national guidelines may
       also apply and require range compliance.
4.2. Safety Responsibilities.
   4.2.1. Different aspects of launch and range safety may be the responsibility of different
   authorities. For example, the protection of a system’s equipment from internal hazards may
   be the responsibility of the SPO Director while the protection of the public from a space
   program's ground and/or flight hazards may be the primary responsibility of the Space Wing
   Commander.
   4.2.2. The Space Wing Commander is responsible for all flight risk to the general public,
   launch area personnel, and other mission support personnel. This responsibility for personnel
   safety extends from liftoff through orbital insertion or from liftoff to impact for suborbital
   launches. It includes jettisoned launch vehicle components and debris released prior to orbital
   insertion.
       4.2.2.1. Launch range safety personnel shall undergo the appropriate training (as
       determined by the MAJCOM Safety Office) for their assigned positions. (T-3)
   4.2.3. The launch vehicle SPO Director is responsible for risk to the general public from
   upper stage reentry following orbital insertion. The launch vehicle SPO Director is also
   responsible for safing disposed upper stages, maximizing compliance with debris mitigation
   guidance, and recovering identifiable launch vehicle (upper stage) debris that lands in foreign
   territory and/or the United States.
   4.2.4. The spacecraft SPO Director is responsible for development safety, management of
   system hazards, and protection of the space program’s equipment from internal hazards
   during the pre-launch phase. The spacecraft SPO Director is responsible for spacecraft
   Orbital Safety from separation of the last launch vehicle component through early orbit
 14                                                                  AFI91-217 11 APRIL 2014


   testing and until the operational organization assumes Satellite Control Authority (SCA).
   Refer to Section 5 for Orbital Safety guidelines.
   4.2.5. Commanders or directors of activities managing Major Range and Test Facility Bases
   (MRTFBs) are authorized to terminate, prohibit, or suspend immediately any DoD, civil,
   commercial and/or test/evaluation event if the commander or director determines that the
   event is or would be detrimental to public health and safety, public or private property, or any
   national security interest of the United States. Reference DoDI 3200.18. The Wing Safety
   Office shall document all determinations made and forward to the MAJCOM Safety Office.
   (T-3)
4.3. Pre-Launch Safety.
   4.3.1. This section covers safety responsibilities for space-related hardware, space program
   operations, and space program facilities during activities (to include testing) at the launch
   base prior to launch countdown operations.
   4.3.2. Pre-launch Operations. Due to the inherent hazards of rockets and launch operations,
   the pre-launch campaign shall commence in a deliberate fashion, with formal milestones and
   reviews to ensure proper employment of mission readiness and adequate launch safety
   processes for the protection of the public and Air Force resources. A Launch Readiness
   Review (LRR) shall occur at the end of the pre-launch phase and before initiating final
   countdown so that the Space Wing Commander has assurance of launch safety and the
   readiness of all personnel and systems involved. (T-3)
   4.3.3. IAW AFMAN 91-222, Space Wing Commanders must identify an ISB President prior
   to each launch from their range. AFI 91-204 outlines the duties of the ISB President. (T-3)
4.4. Launch Safety.
   4.4.1. The following outlines acceptable risk levels for hazards associated with launches.
   Launch operations risk management shall apply risk analysis consistent with DoD, RCC, Air
   Force, and industry standards and practices. (T-3)
   4.4.2. Personnel Risk. The risk criteria listed below applies to all launches. For FAA-
   licensed launches from Air Force ranges, the Air Force shall enforce FAA public risk criteria.
      4.4.2.1. Public. The risk to the general public shall not exceed an individual Probability
      of Casualty (Pc) of 1 x 10-6 (one in one million), and the collective risk to the general
      public shall not exceed a casualty expectation (Ec) of 100 x 10-6 (one hundred in one
      million). These risk levels shall apply for all hazards from lift-off to orbital insertion,
      including planned debris impacts, and from lift-off to final impact for a suborbital
      mission. Reference RCC 321, Common Risk Criteria Standards for National Test
      Ranges.
          4.4.2.1.1. When the risk from toxic hazards exists, the range shall ensure the
          allowable level of risk does not exceed existing safety standards for toxic exposure
          limits for the general public when appropriate mitigations are in place. This
          predetermined Ec shall account for each range’s local population and population
          distribution, applicable national exposure guidelines, and agreements with local
          government authorities. The MAJCOM Safety Office is responsible for ensuring all
          Space Systems with radiological material are in compliance with AFI 91-110,
AFI91-217 11 APRIL 2014                                                                       15


         Nuclear Safety Review and Launch Approval for Space or Missile Use of Radioactive
         Material and Nuclear Systems. All systems containing an amount of radioactive
         material exceeding the thresholds in AFI 91-110 are subject to the Interagency
         Nuclear Safety Review Panel (INSRP) process.
     4.4.2.2. Launch Essential Personnel. For launch essential personnel, the individual Pc
     shall not exceed 10 x 10-6 (ten in one million) and the collective Ec shall not exceed 300 x
     10-6 (three hundred in one million) for all hazards associated with a mission. Reference
     RCC 321.
  4.4.3. Launch Collision Avoidance (LCOLA). All launches from Air Force ranges and all
  Air Force launches from non-Air Force ranges shall accomplish LCOLA procedures
  accounting for all launched objects (e.g., booster segments, payloads, jettisoned components,
  and debris) with an altitude capability equal to or greater than 150 km.
     4.4.3.1. Responsibilities. Launch operators/range users shall provide the launch wings
     and the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) with planned flight profile data for all
     space launch vehicle and jettisoned components (to include upper stages pre-programmed
     for a controlled reentry, up until atmospheric reentry). Space Wing Commanders shall
     establish and enforce launch window hold periods, based on the LCOLA conjunction
     assessments computed by JSpOC against catalogued objects, and on safe separation of
     launched objects as defined by USSTRATCOM, IAW SD 505-1 V2, Space Surveillance
     Operations – Event Processing. For Air Force launches from non-Air Force ranges, the
     senior Air Force representative involved with the launch assumes responsibility of
     LCOLA risk management.
     4.4.3.2. Timeframe. LCOLA shall cover the period of time from when launched objects
     achieve an altitude equal to or greater than 150 km, until location uncertainty makes
     performing a pre-launch safety COLA infeasible, or until the suborbital or reentry
     components descend to less than 150 km.
         4.4.3.2.1. There is currently a gap between the end of the launch COLA and the time
         when JSpOC can establish a reliable track of orbital components, plus the time when
         an active asset can respond to a JSpOC conjunction assessment. This is known as the
         “COLA gap” and is a recognized deficiency in LCOLA assessments. Programs shall
         use industry best practices to mitigate the COLA gap risk to manned objects.
     4.4.3.3. Launch window hold periods. Determine the launch window hold periods based
     on one or a combination of the following methodologies and criteria:
         4.4.3.3.1. Probability of Collision. The probability of collision between the launch
         components and manned objects shall not exceed 1 10-6 (one in one million). The
         probability of collision between the launch components and unmanned objects (to
         include active satellites and orbital debris) shall not exceed 10 x 10-6 (ten in one
         million). Reference RCC 321.
         4.4.3.3.2. Safe Separation Distance. The safe separation distance for manned objects
         shall consist of either ellipsoidal miss distance volumes with semi-axes of 200 km in-
         track, 50 km cross-track, and 50 km radial; or spherical volumes with a radius of 200
         km. The safe separation distance for unmanned objects shall consist of three-sigma
         ellipsoidal miss distance volumes calculated from the covariance data. Where the
 16                                                                 AFI91-217 11 APRIL 2014


          covariance data are not available, utilize a spherical miss distance volume with a
          radius of 25 km for active satellites and 2.5 km for debris.
   4.4.4. Control of Errant Vehicle Flight. The Space Wing Commander must approve the
   methodology for controlling erratic vehicle flight while managing risks to the public and
   foreign countries for all vehicles launched from or onto Air Force ranges.
      4.4.4.1. Range safety organizations shall establish flight safety criteria and mission flight
      rules to ensure operations do not exceed acceptable public safety risk criteria or limits.
      4.4.4.2. Range safety organizations, with Space Wing Commander approval, shall
      establish and control hazardous launch areas and implement procedures to protect the
      public on land, on the sea, and in the air for each launch and launch vehicle using the
      range.
      4.4.4.3. The range shall coordinate with the FAA to ensure timely notification of any
      expected air traffic hazard associated with range activities. In the event of a mishap, the
      range shall immediately inform the FAA of the affected airspace (impact on
      volume/duration). Similarly, the range shall coordinate with the US Coast Guard (USCG)
      to ensure timely notification of potentially hazarded ship traffic and in the event of
      mishap, inform the USCG of the affected sea area and duration of navigable waters.
4.5. Launch Vehicle EOL Requirements.
   4.5.1. Any launch vehicle component that achieves orbit shall undergo passivation and
   disposal procedures as outlined in Chapter 5 of this document.
   4.5.2. Reentry hazards posed by expended launch vehicles or other jettisoned components
   that achieve orbit shall be in the analysis and risk budgets of the disposal/EOL phase.
   Reference DoDI 3100.12.
4.6. Reentry and Recovery Safety.
   4.6.1. The risk criteria listed below apply to hazards associated with reentry
   vehicles/components and reusable launch vehicles/components, to include their jettisoned
   components. They also apply to reentry of expendable launch vehicles/components,
   preprogrammed controlled reentry, and other forms of reentry that involve a reentry or
   landing site. Section 5 addresses disposal of satellites and expended launch vehicle
   components that remain in orbit. Reentry safety begins with the final commitment to re-enter
   the atmosphere (i.e., the final command that initiates or enables the entry and landing
   sequence) and ends when all components associated with the reentry come to rest on the
   Earth. Reentry operations risk management will apply risk analysis consistent with DoD,
   RCC, Air Force, and industry standards and practices.
   4.6.2. Safety Responsibilities. Risk management responsibility directly corresponds with
   mission command and control authority, with the exception of the management of risks
   associated with destructive (non-recoverable) reentry, which the program office manages.
      4.6.2.1. When reusable launch vehicles reenter/land at a different location than the
      launch site, the commander of the launch site is responsible for coordinating
      reentry/landing safety requirements with the reentry/recovery site. The commander or
      equivalent is responsible for requesting applicable waivers to public reentry safety risk
AFI91-217 11 APRIL 2014                                                                          17


     requirements. For FAA-licensed reentries landing at Air Force ranges, range user
     agencies shall comply with both FAA and Air Force reentry requirements. (T-3)
     4.6.2.2. The operator or landing/recovery site commander or equivalent is responsible for
     all reentry risks to the general public, landing recovery area personnel, and other mission
     support personnel from the de-orbit initiation event through final landing and safing of
     the returning space vehicle. (T-3)

     where the reentry vehicle descends to less than 150 km or where location uncertainty
     makes performing a safety COLA infeasible, whichever occurs first. (T-3)
         4.6.2.3.1. For missions where the last opportunity to avert potential collisions during
         the reentry phase of flight is prior to the launch (e.g., preprogrammed controlled
         reentry), the Space Wing Commander responsible for launch shall implement reentry
         safety COLA. (T-3)
         4.6.2.3.2. For missions externally commanding reentry at some time after launch, the

     recovery plans (e.g., land, shallow water, and deep water impacts). For uncontrolled
     reentries of launch vehicle objects or recovery of objects jettisoned during ascent that end
     up on United States or foreign land, the Launch Vehicle SPO Director shall determine
     whether to execute recovery plans for identified space objects. (T-3)
     4.6.2.5. The reentry/recovery site commander or equivalent has the authority to approve
     or deny the initiation of de-orbit. This includes the planned nominal and contingency
     sites.

         limits for the general public, when appropriate mitigations are in place. This
         predetermined Ec shall account for each range’s local population and population
         distribution, applicable national exposure guidelines, and agreements with local
         government authorities.

         track, 50 km cross-track, and 50 km radial, or spherical volumes with a radius of 200
         km. The safe separation distance for unmanned objects shall consist of three-sigma
         ellipsoidal miss distance volumes calculated from the covariance data. Where the
         covariance data are not available, utilize a spherical miss distance volume with a
         radius of 25 km.
  4.6.5. Control of Errant Vehicle Flight. The Space Wing commander or equivalent
  responsible for reentry shall determine if the reentry vehicle requires positive control to meet

  space systems shall develop EOLPs.
     5.4.4.1. Spacecraft PMs shall prepare, update, and deliver a pre-launch combined
     SDAR/EOLP to the operator(s) using a format and content outlined in Attachment 3 for
     the configuration of the space vehicle anticipated at EOL. Launch vehicle PMs shall
     ensure the launch vehicle SDAR contains any orbital launch vehicle component EOLP
     information. (T-2)
  5.4.5. Assessment of Debris Released During Normal Operations. PMs shall design space
  systems to eliminate or minimize the creation of any operational or mission-related debris. If
  the release of debris is unavoidable, programs shall obtain appropriate exceptions to policy
  and minimize the number, size, and orbital lifetime of any debris released. This requirement
  applies to all space systems in Earth orbit. Note: Operational or mission-related debris
  includes debris released during normal space operations (e.g., sensor covers, tie-down straps,
  explosive bolt fragments). It does not include slag ejected during the burning of a solid rocket
  motor or liquids dispersed from a spacecraft.
     5.4.5.1. Debris passing through Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). For missions leaving debris in
     orbits passing through LEO, released debris with diameters of 5 mm or larger shall have
     maximum orbital lifetimes of 25 years from date of release. The total object-time product
     shall not exceed 100 object-years per mission. The object-time product is the sum over all
     debris of the total time spent below 2000 km altitude during the orbital lifetime of each
     object. Reference NASA-STD-8719.14A.
     5.4.5.2. Debris passing near Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO). For missions leaving debris
     in orbits with the potential of traversing GEO (GEO altitude +/- 200 km and +/- 15
     degrees latitude), released debris with diameters of 5 cm or greater shall be left in orbits
     which will ensure that within 25 years after release the apogee will no longer exceed
     GEO - 200 km. Reference NASA-STD-8719.14.
  5.4.6. Assessment of Debris Generated by Accidental Explosions. Programs shall assess and
  limit the probability of accidental explosion during and after completion of mission
  operations through satellite decommissioning and disposal.
     5.4.6.1. The PM for each spacecraft or launch vehicle shall:
         5.4.6.1.1. Demonstrate via failure mode and effects analyses (or equivalent) that the
         integrated probability of explosion for all failure modes (excluding collisions) of each
         separate spacecraft and launch vehicle orbital stage is less than 1 10-3 (one in one
         thousand). Reference NASA-STD 8719.14. (T-3)
         5.4.6.1.2. Ensure the design of all spacecraft and launch vehicle components include
         the ability to deplete onboard sources of stored energy and disconnect energy
         generation sources when no longer required for mission operations or post-mission
         disposal or control. (T-3)
AFI91-217 11 APRIL 2014                                                                         23


      5.4.6.2. The operating unit shall deplete and/or safe all onboard sources of stored energy
      of the space system (e.g., residual propellants, batteries, high-pressure vessels, self-
      destructive devices, flywheels, and momentum wheels) when no longer required for
      mission operations. Depletion shall occur as soon as this operation does not pose an
      unacceptable risk to the payload. (T-3)
   5.4.7. Assessment of Debris Generated by Intentional Breakups. Programs shall assess and
   limit the effect of intentional breakups of spacecraft and launch vehicle orbital stages on
   other users of space. Consistent with cost effectiveness and mission objectives, organizations
   conducting intentional breakups and/or collisions shall ensure that:
      5.4.7.1. Planned explosions or intentional collisions shall occur at altitudes such that, for
      orbital debris fragments larger than 10 cm, the object-time product does not exceed 100
      object-years. No debris larger than 1 mm shall remain in Earth orbit longer than one year.
      Reference NASA-STD-8719.14A.
      5.4.7.2. Immediately before a planned explosion or intentional collision, the probability
      of related debris larger than 1 mm colliding with any active spacecraft within 24 hours of
      the breakup shall not exceed 1 10-6 (one in one million). Reference NASA-STD
      8719.14A.
   5.4.8. Assessment of Debris Generated by On-orbit Collisions. In developing the design and
   mission profile of a space system, a program shall estimate and limit the probability of
   accidental collision with trackable space objects during the system's orbital lifetime.
      5.4.8.1. Collisions with Large Objects. Programs shall demonstrate that, during the
      orbital lifetime of each spacecraft or launch vehicle component in or passing through
      LEO, the probability of accidental collision with space objects larger than 10 cm in
      diameter is less than 1 10-3 (one in one thousand). Reference NASA-STD 8719.14.
      5.4.8.2. Collisions with Small Objects. Programs shall demonstrate that, during the
      mission of the space system, the probability of accidental collision with objects
      (including space debris and meteoroids) sufficient to prevent post-mission disposal is less
      than 1 10-2 (one in one hundred). Reference NASA-STD-8719.14.
5.5. Conjunction Assessment and Safety Collision Avoidance.
   5.5.1. All active on-orbit spacecraft require an approved CA/COLA process. (T-2)
   5.5.2. Through the JSpOC, JFCC Space is the lead agency for orbital conjunction
   assessments. All Air Force launch and orbital space systems shall use JSpOC generated CA
   runs for safety COLA risk decisions.
   5.5.3. Consistent with mission capabilities and resource availability, Space Wings shall
   obtain routine conjunction assessments for their active spacecraft against all catalogued
   objects within JSpOC established threat thresholds.
   5.5.4. The approved COLA process shall identify collision risk levels and collision risk
   acceptance for each Space Safety Program.
   5.5.5. Close Proximity Operations. Orbital operations involving the close proximity of two
   or more space objects require special consideration. Formation operations typically involve
 24                                                                   AFI91-217 11 APRIL 2014


   spacecraft specifically designed to operate in close proximity to one another. These
   operations may involve refueling or re-boosting of the ‘recipient’ space object.
      5.5.5.1. Organizations shall develop procedures for close proximity operations, to
      include avoidance of unintended spacecraft-to-spacecraft contact, unnecessary debris
      generation, or contamination of sensitive equipment (e.g., from spacecraft thruster
      firings, other off-gassing).
5.6. Safe Separation to Manned and Active Spacecraft.
   5.6.1. The organization with Satellite Control Authority is responsible for protecting manned
   spacecraft and active spacecraft following separation of the last launch vehicle component
   through satellite decommissioning, EOL disposal, or reentry. All orbital operations shall
   comply with the following risk criteria unless documented waivers exist: (T-1)
   5.6.2. The probability of collision with manned spacecraft shall not exceed 1 10-6 (one in
   one million) per spacecraft.
   5.6.3. The probability of collision with active satellites shall not exceed 10 x 10 -6 (ten in one
   million) per spacecraft.
5.7. End-of-Life Actions.
   5.7.1. All spacecraft and orbital launch vehicle components shall undergo passivation and
   disposal at EOL via the methods outlined in this section. (T-2)
   5.7.2. Reliability of post-mission EOL operations. Programs shall ensure that all post-
   mission EOL operations incorporate designs for a probability of success as follows:
      5.7.2.1. For EOL operations not associated with controlled reentry, analyses should
      demonstrate that the probability of successful execution is no less than 0.90 at EOL. This
      calculation builds from an initial pre-launch estimate of the ability to execute an EOL
      maneuver, and shall undergo periodic re-assessment during the orbital operations phase.
      Updates to EOL planning shall occur at major operational milestones.
      5.7.2.2. For controlled reentry, the probability of success at the time of the reentry burn
      shall be sufficiently high so as not to cause a violation pertaining to limiting the risk of
      human casualty.
   5.7.3. Disposal. All Air Force space systems, including research and development systems,
   shall comply with the disposal requirements outlined in this document and the ODMSP.
   Organizations with Satellite Control Authority shall utilize one of the disposal options below.
      5.7.3.1. Atmospheric Reentry. The preferred disposal option is atmospheric reentry when
      feasible.
          5.7.3.1.1. Uncontrolled Atmospheric Reentry. Leave the spacecraft or launch vehicle
          component in an orbit in which natural forces will lead to atmospheric reentry within
          25 years after the end of mission.
              5.7.3.1.1.1. The collective risk to the general public due to uncontrolled
              atmospheric reentry shall not exceed a casualty expectation (Ec) of 100 x 10-6 (one
              hundred in one million).
              5.7.3.1.1.2. Any maneuvers required to place the spacecraft or launch vehicle in a
AFI91-217 11 APRIL 2014                                                                        25


            compliant atmospheric reentry orbit shall comply with the requirements in Section
            5.6.
         5.7.3.1.2. Controlled Atmospheric Reentry. For controlled reentry of any orbiting
         object, the selected trajectory shall comply with the requirements in Section 4.6.
     5.7.3.2. Disposal Orbits. At EOL, relocate the structure to a storage regime consistent
     with the ODMSP.
         5.7.3.2.1. When selecting disposal orbits, operators shall account for spacecraft
         area/mass ratio and the effect of future orbital drift due to gravitational perturbations
         and other space environmental effects. Due to fuel gauging uncertainties near the end
         of mission, use a maneuver strategy that has the least risk of leaving the structure near
         an operational orbit regime.
     5.7.3.3. Direct retrieval. Direct retrieval strategies shall comply with all disposal
     requirements in this AFI and in the ODMSP.
  5.7.4. Passivation. All spacecraft and launch vehicle components, to include research and
  development systems, shall undergo passivation during final disposal.
     5.7.4.1. During space system design and development, the PM shall identify sources or
     potential sources of stored energy and shall develop and implement a plan for minimizing
     these sources at EOL. The PM shall include a description of the passivation procedure in
     the SDAR and if applicable, the EOLP. This description shall not only identify the
     passivation actions for all sources of stored energy but also provide a notional timeline of
     when the actions shall take place. This plan shall identify all passivation measures, to
     include:
         5.7.4.1.1. Burning residual propellants to depletion.

                                          Chapter 6

                           GROUND-BASED SPACE SYSTEMS

6.1. Ground-Based Space Systems.
   6.1.1. Ground-based space systems include unique space support equipment as well as
   space-related systems that do not directly support launch operations or on-orbit satellite
   operations. Examples include warning, surveillance, and offensive/defensive space control
   systems such as the Space Surveillance Network, the Rapid Attack Identification, Detection
   and Reporting System (RAIDRS), and the Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack
   Assessment (ITW/AA) system.
6.2. Space Control Systems.
   6.2.1. All organizations that test or operate space control systems shall have a Space Safety
   Program. Note: Consistent with MAJCOM guidelines, organizations may operate systems
   with tailored-down Space Safety Programs. (T-2)
   6.2.2. Consistent with guidance related to hazard elimination or mitigation requirements
   IAW AFPD 90-8, Environment, Safety & Occupational Health Management and Risk
   Management, all space control systems shall limit the unintended effects of the system on
   personnel, the environment, or on other ground, air, or space systems.
   6.2.3. Operators of these systems shall take special care not to produce unintended effects
   during operations. Reference SI 534-15, Risk Management and Radio Frequency
   Deconfliction for Space Control Activities for further information.
   6.2.4. Space Safety Programs shall emphasize test program validation (to include procedures
   discipline, readiness reviews, and test execution risk management) and configuration control
   in order to minimize unintended events or failures.
6.3. Space-Related Warning Systems.
   6.3.1. Warning systems have unique safety risks.
   6.3.2. Operational organizations’ Space Safety Programs shall address the mishap risks
   associated with the use of warning systems (e.g., high-powered radars, erroneous missile
   warning messages). (T-2)
   6.3.3. Program managers shall address the mishap risks associated with the use of warning
   systems as a part of their System Safety effort IAW DoDI 5000.02.
   6.3.4. Operational organizations and program offices shall use the following guidance to
   manage and assess warning system risks.
      6.3.4.1. Reducing the risk of and preventing mission down time is an important aspect of
      mishap prevention for warning systems. Operational organizations use the same
      timeframes used by the controlling Air Operations Center to report down times that relate
      to safety and report mishaps IAW AFMAN 91-222. Program offices shall reduce the risk
      of mission down time as part of their overall System Safety effort.
      6.3.4.2. Reducing the risk of and preventing erroneous warning information is another
      important aspect of mishap prevention for warning systems.
 28                                                                 AFI91-217 11 APRIL 2014


          6.3.4.2.1. The mishap severity category for sending erroneous warning information
          to the Integrated Tactical Warning and Assessment Center is critical; the mishap
          severity category for erroneous warnings getting to National Command Authority is
          catastrophic.
          6.3.4.2.2. Warning System Safety Programs shall ensure the employment of risk
          reduction methods to prevent the sending of erroneous data up command channels by
          reviewing items such as hazard reports, reported mishaps/deficiencies, test safety
          procedures and risk assessments, and system change proposals that impact safety.
       6.3.4.3. For the purpose of operational Space Safety Program management, the mishap
       severity category for high-power radars causing minor injury or illness is critical; the
       mishap severity category for high-power radars causing death or major injury is
       catastrophic. Program offices shall use MIL-STD-882 severity category definitions.
6.4. Other Space systems.
   6.4.1. Space-related systems that directly support multiple unrelated space systems (e.g., Air
   Force Satellite Control Network) shall have their own Space Safety Program. This Space
   Safety Program shall take into account system interfaces, capabilities, and vulnerabilities in
   order to assess the risks of testing or operating these systems. Note: Safety for space-related
   systems that directly support a single program or space system shall be in the scope of the
   Space Safety Program of the space system supported. (T-2)
6.5. Risk Responsibility.
   6.5.1. The operational and acquisition organizations shall agree upon and document the risk
   responsibility for space control. Risk responsibility only applies to risks that are within the
   control of a particular agency/authority. The risk responsibility for the various mission
   phases may overlap. (T-3)
   6.5.2. Throughout the life cycle, to include operations and disposal, PMs for Ground-Based
   Space Systems shall manage and accept all system risks IAW DoDI 5000.02 and AFI 63-
   101/20-101. PMs must involve operational representatives in this process.

Air Force space systems and launches, the Space and Missiles Systems Center (SMC) will
usually perform this function.
Active Satellite/Active Spacecraft—Orbiting systems that serve a useful purpose or could
potentially serve a useful purpose (e.g., fully mission capable, partially mission capable, on-orbit
spares, in test/checkout).
AFI91-217 11 APRIL 2014                                                                       33

but do not reach the level of a reportable mishap.
Anomaly Resolution Process—Any process used to resolve a spacecraft anomaly. Typically
conducted by the operating/testing organization (squadron or equivalent level).
Apogee—The point of a satellite’s greatest distance from the center of the Earth, where the
satellite’s velocity is lowest. The apogee altitude is the distance of the apogee point above the
surface of the Earth.
Cataloged Objects—Items entered in the JSpOC Satellite Catalog. Some items re-enter the
Earth’s atmosphere after cataloging.

essential personnel, general public) exposed to a particular hazard during a specific period of
time or event; unless otherwise noted, the mean number of casualties predicted (Ec) to result
from a given hazard. Specification of collective risk is either in “per mission” or “per year”
value.
Collision Avoidance—A process designed to prevent collisions between on-orbit tracked objects
or to prevent collisions between on-orbit tracked objects and launched vehicles (including spent
stages)/payloads by determining and implementing courses of action through careful analysis of
validated conjunction assessments and satellite health and mission requirements. The process
includes establishing launch wait periods in either the launch window or spacecraft maneuvering
based on validated conjunction assessments and accounts for uncertainties in spatial dispersions,
arrival time of orbiting objects and/or the launch vehicle/payload, and modeling accuracy.
Commercial Launch—The term “commercial,” for the purposes of the National Space Policy
and this instruction, refers to space goods, services, or activities provided by private sector

Controlled Reentry—See Uncontrolled Reentry. A planned reentry for which the final
atmospheric penetration time is chosen through spacecraft maneuvering so as to either maximize
the amount of spacecraft material that burns up in the atmosphere, limiting the potential for
endangering the public, or to bring down a recoverable reentry vehicle (e.g., capsule) in a
manner that does not endanger the public. This typically controls the time and place of the
disposal of space objects that are at the end of their mission life or for reentry capsules.
Debris—Any non-maneuverable/non-operational orbital space system or component. This
includes dead satellites and their associated components, spent launch vehicle components, and
objects in orbit around the Earth created by humans but no longer serve any useful purpose.
Debris includes explosion and collision fragments, slag (including dust) from solid rocket
motors, surface degradation products such as paint flakes, coolant released by nuclear powered
satellites, and objects released due to the impact of micrometeoroids or small debris with
spacecraft.

geosynchronous orbits have an approximate altitude of 22,300 miles (36,000 km) and an
inclination between ±15º of the equatorial plane.
Hazard—Any real or potential condition that can cause injury, illness, or death to personnel;
damage to or loss of a system, equipment, or property; damage to the environment; or mission
degradation.
Hazardous Launch Areas—Safety clearance zones during launch operations with defined
mishap probabilities, including the flight caution area, flight hazard area, vessel/boat exclusion
area, and impact limit lines.
Hazardous Materials—Liquids, gases, or solids that may be toxic, reactive, or flammable, or
that may cause oxygen deficiency either singularly or in combination with other materials.

safely complete an operation and whose absence would jeopardize the completion of the
operation. This includes persons required to perform emergency actions according to authorized
directives, persons specifically authorized by the Wing Commander/System Program Office
(SPO) Director to perform scheduled activities, and persons in training. The number of mission-
essential personnel allowed within Safety Clearance Zones or Hazardous Launch Areas is
determined by the Wing Commander/SPO Director and the Range User with Range Safety
concurrence.
Launch Mishap—See Orbital Mishap and Pre-Launch. Mishaps that occur between the initial
ignition of any stage of the rocket and up until the final piece of launch hardware separates from
the spacecraft. This includes payloads not launched into the intended orbit.
Launch Operation—Operations occurring in the terminal countdown through sub-orbital flight
or orbital insertion.
Launch Operator—A person or entity that conducts or proposes to conduct the launch of a
launch vehicle for the purpose of inserting a spacecraft into orbit or delivering a payload to a
specified ballistic location.

with any motion of the launch vehicle with respect to the launch platform (which includes a
carrier aircraft), including any intentional or unintentional separation from the launch platform.
Low Earth Orbit (LEO)There is no approved consensus definition for low earth orbit. AFDD
3-14 describes LEO as an altitude of "about 100 to 1,000 statute miles." JP 3-14 describes LEO
as "generally considered to have an apogee of no more than 1000 kilometers from farthest point
from the point in the orbit to the center of the earth." The UN's Inter-Agency Space Debris
Coordination (IADC) Committee defines LEO as the "spherical region that extends from the
Earth's surface up to an altitude (Z) of 2,000 km." This AFI utilizes the IADC term; this allows
 36                                                                 AFI91-217 11 APRIL 2014


for standardization and consistency with the US Government Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard
Practices, which uses this definition.
Maneuver—Spacecraft operation designed to change the velocity (speed and/or direction) of a
spacecraft using either an internal/integrated propulsion system or an externally attached booster
system.
Manned Object—See Unmanned Object. A spacecraft that is currently occupied, or is expected
to be occupied in the future. This AFI considers supply vehicles to manned spacecraft as manned
objects.
Meteoroids—A solid object moving in interplanetary space, of a size considerably smaller than
an asteroid and considerably larger than an atom or molecule (e.g., meteoroid material associated
with asteroid breakup or material released from comets).
Mishap—A mishap is an unplanned occurrence or series of occurrences that results in damage
or injury and meets Class A, B, C, D, and E mishap reporting criteria IAW AFI 91-204. Damage
or injury includes: damage to DoD property or equipment; environmental damage; occupational
illness to DoD military or civilian personnel; injury to DoD military personnel on- or off-duty;
injury to on-duty DoD civilian personnel; damage to public or private property, injury or illness
to non-DoD personnel caused by Air Force operations. For space mishaps, it also includes
permanent or partial mission loss.
Missile—A rocket-propelled or jet-propelled expendable vehicle used to deliver a warhead. It
may use a ballistic trajectory or fly under active guidance and control.
Mission Assurance—An integrated engineering-level assessment of analysis, production,
verification, validation, operation, maintenance, and problem resolution processes performed
over the life-cycle of a program by which an operator/user determines an acceptable level of risk
to employment of a system or end item to deliver an intended capability in an intended
environment. The objective of the mission assurance process is to identify and mitigate design,
production, test and operational deficiencies that could impact mission success.
Mission Effectiveness—See operational effectiveness.

are risks the range Commander may tolerate to secure certain benefits from a range activity with
the confidence of proper risk management within prescribed limits (RCC 321).
Uncontrolled Reentry—See Controlled Reentry. A random reentry in which the
spacecraft/object reenters the atmosphere where an operator cannot sufficiently determine or
influence the surface impact point prior to reentry. This is the typical reentry method for debris
and spacecraft in decay orbits where the final reentry point and time is underdetermined due to
uncertainty in atmospheric density conditions due to the extended time period between disposal
and reentry.
Unique Space Support Equipment—Systems, equipment, and facilities required for supporting
other space systems. Includes launch and orbital space support systems.
Unmanned Object—See Manned Object. A spacecraft that is neither currently occupied nor
expected to be occupied in the future by human beings.

        LAUNCH VEHICLE SPACE DEBRIS ASSESSMENT REPORT (SDAR)

A2.1. Delivery Requirements
Note: SDAR delivery will be IAW the requirements specified below. The normal schedule is:
   A2.1.1. PDR draft SDAR: 30 days prior to the program or project PDR or equivalent
   program/project development milestone. The PM receives the draft document and distributes
   it to the Chief Engineer and Safety Office and other offices as required. The purpose of
   preparing the report early in the design and development process is to ensure early
   identification of orbital debris issues when resolutions are least costly to implement. Any
   orbital debris mitigation compliance issues not resolved by the PDR require resolution no
   later than the CDR or equivalent program/project development milestone.
   A2.1.2. CDR draft SDAR: 45 days prior to the program or project CDR or equivalent
   program/project development milestone. The purpose of the CDR draft is to update and
   clarify the issues and changes to the PDR Draft. The PM will submit the CDR draft for
   review and concurrence to the Center-level (or equivalent) Chief Engineer, both the Center-
   level and NAF-level (or equivalent) Safety Offices, and any other offices as required.
   Appropriate operations (NAF-level or equivalent) commanders (or their designated
   approving officials) shall accept non-compliances with published criteria specified in this
   instruction that exist at CDR. The appropriate Acquisition official IAW DoDI 5000.02 shall
   accept the mishap risk associated with the hazard referred to in the criteria. JFCC Space will
   receive an information copy of the CDR draft SDAR.
   A2.1.3. Final Launch Vehicle SDAR: The PM will submit the Final Launch Vehicle SDAR
   30 days prior to the launch approval process (Air Force Operational Readiness Review
   (ORR) or Flight Readiness Review (FRR) or equivalent) for approval and signature by the
   appropriate acquisition authorities (Center Commander or equivalent, or designated
   approving official). Prior to SDAR approval signature by the appropriate acquisition
   authority, the Center (or equivalent) technical and/or safety subject matter expert (SME) will
   independently review the final launch vehicle SDAR. In addition, in the event of non-
   compliances requiring user concurrence on risk acceptance, the NAF (or equivalent)
   technical and/or safety SME will also review the final launch vehicle SDAR prior to
   approval. CDR JFCC Space will receive an information copy of the signed final SDAR prior
   to launch. Air Force exception to National Space Policy shall staff through Headquarters Air
   Force, Space Operations (Air Force/A3S) for Secretary of Defense approval.
