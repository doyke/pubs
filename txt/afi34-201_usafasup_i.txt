This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 34-2, Managing
Nonappropriated Funds. It provides the basic responsibilities, procedures, and practices for all
Air Force nonappropriated funds (NAF) and nonappropriated fund instrumentalities (NAFI)
under the responsibility of the Air Force Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Advisory Board
(AFMWRAB).

The Board of Directors, Army and Air Force Civilian Welfare Fund (AAFCWF), has approved
the use of this instruction by base restaurant funds (BRFs) and base civilian welfare funds
(BCWFs), provided guidance does not conflict with AFJI 34-122, Civilian Nonappropriated
Funds (NAFs) and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Activities. In cases of conflict, AFJI
34-122 takes precedence.

Major commands (MAJCOM) may supplement this instruction with advance approval of the
Commander, Air Force Services Agency. Send two copies of each proposed MAJCOM
supplement to the Directorate of Financial Management and Comptroller, Headquarters Air
Force Services Agency (HQ AFSVA/SVF), 10100 Reunion Place, Suite 400, San Antonio TX
78216-4138. Send copies of each published MAJCOM supplement to the Director of Services,

Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF), 1770 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC
20330-1770, and to HQ AFSVA/SVFA. Forward one copy of each approved supplement that
applies to the AAFCWF to HQ AFMC/SVPB, 4375 Chidlaw Road, Room N237, Wright
Patterson AFB OH 45433-5001.

(USAFA) The purpose of this supplement is to outline policies and procedures for use of NAFs
at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) to include the Air Force Academy Athletic
Association (AFAAA). As a member institution of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA), the AFAAA has some uses of NAFs that are different than those available to normal
nonappropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI). This supplement provides guidance provided by
the NCAA. This supplement applies to all personnel, including military, civilians and
contractors, assigned to the Directorate of Athletics (USAFA/AD). This publication does not
apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units and the Air National Guard (ANG). Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this supplement are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. See Attachment 1 for a glossary of references and supporting
information.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2002-1. This change expands the Special Morale
and Welfare (SM&W) expenditure authority to provide mementos to the spouses of awardees,
promoted individuals, and retirees, and mementos for guests of honor at memorialization
(naming a street, building, etc.) functions. The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment.

(USAFA) This revision provides authority to purchase awards for cadets, coaches and staff on
occasions and in amounts consistent with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)
rules (Paragraph 4.1.24. and its subsequent paragraphs). These authorities add unique language
to Chapters 4, What NAFs Cover and Don’t Cover, and Chapter 5, NAFI Transfers, Donations
and Contributions. This revision also adds the mandatory Opening paragraph, updates the OPR
of this supplement to the Directorate of Athletics’ Resource division (USAFA/ADF), updates
office symbols for the Directorate of Athletics throughout the supplement, updates references to
10th Services Squadron to the 10th Forces Support Squadron throughout the publication,
replaces references to an obsolete supplement (AFI 65-106, USAFA Sup 1) with the approved
Memorandum of Agreement (Paragraph 3.10.1.1. and Paragraph 4.1.8.), updates meal limits for
prospective cadet athletes (Paragraph 4.1.23.), removes monetary references for awards
(Paragraph 4.1.24. – 4.1.24.4.), updates eligibility amount for Bowl Game Memorabilia
Packages (Paragraph 4.1.24.3.), updates USAFA Superintendent’s authority to accept
contributions and donations up to $250K for the AFAAA (Paragraph 5.7.1.2.1.), and
incorporates specific provisions and authorities for the United States Air Force Academy
Athletic Association, removes USAFA Protocol’s responsibilities for budget management and a
self-inspection program as this supplement relates to USAFA/AD NAF responsibilities (formerly
Paragraph 12.2.2.2.1., 12.2.4.3., and 12.7.), and adds the Glossary of References and Supporting
Information (Attachment 1).

                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs). NAFs are Government funds but are separate and apart
from funds that are recorded in the books of the US Treasury. They are not appropriated by the
Congress. NAFs come primarily from the sale of goods and services to Department of Defense
(DoD) military and civilian personnel and their families.
1.2. Purpose of Air Force NAFs. Use NAFs for the collective benefit of military personnel,
their families, and authorized civilians. These funds support morale, welfare, and recreation
(MWR) programs, lodging, certain religious and educational programs, and other programs
authorized in this instruction.
1.3. Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI). A NAFI is an integral DoD fiscal and
organizational entity that performs an essential Government function. It acts in its own name to
provide, or to help other DoD organizations provide MWR and related programs and services.
The heads of the service departments establish and operate NAFIs individually or jointly.
1.4. Legal Status of Air Force NAFIs. An Air Force NAFI is an integral part of the Air Force.
A NAFI is entitled to all sovereign privileges and immunities of the United States as provided in
the Constitution and the statutes, under international law, in treaties, and in executive
agreements. A NAFI is not incorporated under the laws of any state of the United States, District
of Columbia, or foreign equivalent. It enjoys the legal status of an instrumentality of the United
States.
1.5. NAFIs and Other Activities Not Controlled by This Instruction. These NAFIs exist on
bases but are not subject to this instruction:
   1.5.1. Joint Army and Air Force NAFIs. Responsibility for joint Army and Air Force
   NAFIs is vested in:
       1.5.1.1. The Board of Directors, Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), for
       AAFES. See the AFJI 34-series regulations for policy, organization, and administration
       of this NAFI.
       1.5.1.2. The Board of Directors, Army and Air Force Civilian Welfare Fund
       (AAFCWF), for base civilian welfare and base restaurant NAFIs. By joint Army and Air
       Force agreement specified in Army and Air Force Adjustment regulation No. 1-30-1, the
       Secretaries of the Air Force and Army have vested responsibility for the AAFCWF with
       the Board of Directors, AAFCWF. The Board oversees policy for base restaurant funds,
       base civilian welfare funds, and the AACFWF.
   1.5.2. Stars and Stripes NAFIs. The European and Pacific Stars and Stripes funds furnish
   information and news services to persons serving in their areas of operation. Stars and
   Stripes funds are managed as prescribed in Unified Commands (USEUCOM), Headquarters
   US Army Europe (USAREUR) and Pacific Command (PACOM) command directives.
   1.5.3. Private Organizations. See AFI 34-123, Private Organizations Program.

1.6. NAFI Records. All records that NAFIs create and receive are official Air Force records.
See the AFI 37-series instructions for their creation, use, maintenance, release, and disposition.
1.7. NAF Contracts. See AFI 64-301, NAF Contracting, and AFMAN 64-302, NAF
Contracting, for specific NAF contracting procedures.
1.8. Delegations. For purposes of this instruction, don't delegate the authorities and
responsibilities assigned to specific positions unless otherwise provided.

   Procedures, and AFI 65-403, Follow up on Internal US Air Force Audit Reports, to make
   sure that each of the functions meets current needs in a manner consistent with sound
 16                                                     AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010


      business practices. These audits meet the standards required by Government Auditing
      Standards issued by the United States GAO.

                        ESTABLISHING AND DISSOLVING NAFIS

Section 3A—Establishing NAFIs

3.1. Basic Procedures. The CSAF, under the authority of the SAF:
   - Establishes or dissolves Air Force NAFIs that are under the purview of the AFMWRAB.
   - Determines the official designations and categories of these and other Air Force NAFIs in
   accordance with Congressional and DoD guidance.
   - Administers Air Force-level NAFIs. Certain Air Force-level NAFIs are successor NAFIs
   (see paragraph 3.3.) for other NAFIs.
   3.1.1. A command-level MWR fund exists at:
   - Each MAJCOM.
   - Each field operating agency (FOA) headquarters that has jurisdiction and host
   responsibility over one or more bases.
   - HQ AFSVA.
       3.1.1.1. MAJCOMs and FOAs establish an MWR fund NAFI at each Air Force base
       within the command.
   3.1.2. HQ USAF/SV approves the establishment of MAJCOM NAFIs and installation
   NAFIs that aren't specifically listed in Chapter 3, Section 3B.
   3.1.3. NAFIs below HQ USAF level created after 1 Oct 1988 must have a charter
   (Attachment 3) signed by the official who authorized the NAFI, for example, the MAJCOM
   commander. This authority is called the chartering authority.
       3.1.3.1. In the chartering authority letter, include:
          3.1.3.1.1. The proposed purpose of the NAFI.
          3.1.3.1.2. A clear justification of how the NAFI was necessary to meet Air Force
          program objectives.
          3.1.3.1.3. Types of functional activities the NAFI will conduct.
          3.1.3.1.4. Successor NAFI (paragraph 3.3).
          3.1.3.1.5. A financial plan to operate the supported activities.
NOTE: NAFIs established before or initially established as a result of implementation of the
installation MWR fund concept or Air Force reorganization/restructure is not affected by this
paragraph's requirement, but disestablishment is according to this instruction.
   3.1.4. Each NAFI's official title must be standard. Prefix NAFI titles by the applicable
   command, base, or isolated unit's official name; for example, Air Combat Command MWR
   Fund and Randolph Air Force Base MWR Fund.
 18                                                      AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010


3.2. Categorizing NAFIs and Activities. (See AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of
Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Programs and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, for
categories of NAFIs and activities.) Categorize NAFIs and activities to:
   3.2.1. Ensure uniformity and standardization.
   3.2.2. Promote an understanding of the relationships of NAFIs to the activities they support.
   3.2.3. Identify how much appropriated fund (APF) support may be authorized for MWR
   activities within each category.
3.3. Successor NAFIs. Establish NAFIs through the successive delegation of authority through
command channels. Each NAFI has a successor NAFI at either base, MAJCOM, or HQ USAF
level. They ensure responsive, responsible and solvent NAFI financial administration.
   3.3.1. A successor NAFI:
         3.3.1.1. Provides the initial assets to establish a new subordinate NAFI. Identifies the
         successor NAFI in each new NAFI's charter.
         3.3.1.2. Acts on requests from its subordinate organizations for support or assistance.
         3.3.1.3. Receives or directs the disposition of residual assets of dissolved NAFIs for
         which it is the successor NAFI.
         3.3.1.4. Ensures all debts of the dissolved NAFI are settled.
         3.3.1.5. Notifies the successor NAFI custodian immediately when it intends to dissolve a
         NAFI. The custodian of the dissolving NAFI ensures that no one wastes NAFI's assets.
         3.3.1.6. Receives or redistributes excess assets as authorized for the type of NAFI
         involved.
      3.3.2. Names and relationships of successor NAFIs are as follows:
         3.3.2.1. The Air Force Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund (AFMWRF) is the
         successor NAFI for all the HQ USAF NAFIs, MAJCOM MWR funds, Air Force portion
         of AAFES, and any other funds that the CSAF specifies.
         3.3.2.2. The Air Force Lodging Fund (AFLF) is the successor NAFI for MAJCOM
         lodging funds. The AFLF pays severance at closing bases when there aren't enough
         funds in residual assets or the MAJCOM lodging fund is insolvent. The MAJCOM
         lodging fund acts as successor for base lodging funds within the command.
         3.3.2.3. The MAJCOM MWR fund is the successor NAFI for the MAJCOM's base
         MWR funds and any other base NAFIs under the purview of the AFMWRAB, except for
         lodging funds, civilian welfare funds, and base restaurants. The MAJCOM MWR fund is
         also the successor NAFI for Stars and Stripes (where applicable) and isolated unit MWR
         funds. EXCEPTION: If the isolated unit fund is funded by a base MWR fund, the base
         MWR fund is the successor NAFI.
         3.3.2.4. (Added-USAFA) The Air Force Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Fund
         is the successor fund to the AFAAA Fund.
   3.3.3. Specify any deviation from successor relationships identified in this instruction in the
   charter and get prior approval from Chairman, Finance and Audit Committee, AFMWRAB.
AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010                                                               19


Section 3B—Types of NAFIs.

3.4. Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) NAFs. APFs, NAFs, and a combination of
APFs and NAFs fund MWR programs and facilities, depending on their nature.
   3.4.1. The custodian determines whether MWR or other authorized programs proposed for
   NAF funding fit the criteria for support stated in this instruction. Sources of funds include:
      3.4.1.1. Air Force AAFES dividends paid monthly to installation and MAJCOM MWR
      funds. Distribution to bases is a percentage of local AAFES exchange sales. MAJCOMs
      receive an amount equal to a percentage of what their bases receive. HQ USAF/SV
      establishes the percentage amounts. Chapter 11 covers locations where no AAFES
      exchange facilities exist.
      3.4.1.2. Local fees and charges, membership dues, and proceeds from the sale of
      merchandise and services from MWR activities. This income remains at the generating
      base to support MWR programs and activities.
      3.4.1.3. Contributions and donations.
      3.4.1.4. Income from other sources, including concessionaire-operated activities.
3.5. Command, Base, and Unit-level MWR NAFIs.
   3.5.1. Command-level MWR Funds. Establish command-level MWR funds according to
   paragraph 3.1 and establish councils according to paragraph 2.6.3
      3.5.1.1. Income includes:
          3.5.1.1.1. Residual assets of dissolved or inactivated subordinate MWR NAFIs.
          3.5.1.1.2. Distributions from other MAJCOM-level NAFIs and the AFMWRF.
          3.5.1.1.3. Other contributions and donations accepted as authorized.
      3.5.1.2. Expenditures include:
          3.5.1.2.1. Redistribution of assets as authorized in this instruction.
          3.5.1.2.2. Unpaid bills of dissolved subordinate NAFIs.
          3.5.1.2.3. Costs for authorized programs and activities of, and services required by,
          the NAFI.
   3.5.2. Installation MWR Funds (MWRF). The installation MWRF NAFI receives,
   administers, and disburses funds to help finance MWR activities and programs at base-level
   when they aren't supported by another installation NAFI. See authorized expenditures in
   Chapter 4. Income comes from:
      3.5.2.1. Distributions from higher headquarters NAFIs.
      3.5.2.2. Incidental income, such as participation fees and charges and proceeds from the
      sale of merchandise and services (see paragraph 4.4).

      3.5.2.6. Residual assets of dissolved or inactivated subordinate unit MWR funds.
      3.5.2.7. Membership dues.
      3.5.2.8. Direct AAFES dividends.
   3.5.3. New Programs. AFI 34-209 describes the NAF cost center code (CCC) to use in
   reporting NAF income and expenses associated with authorized MWR programs and
   services.
      3.5.3.1. If a proposed program is not covered by an existing CCC, submit a brief
      description of the program through the MAJCOM and HQ AFSVA/SVF to HQ
      USAF/SV for review.
      3.5.3.2. HQ USAF/SV assigns the proper APF support category and CCC, evaluates its
      impact on insurance coverage and premiums, and provides additional guidance on how to
      conduct the new program.
   3.5.4. Isolated Unit Funds (IUF). Unit-level MWR funds are authorized for active Air
   Force and AFRES units that are designated as isolated. The Air Force MWR or AFRES
   MWR Fund provides support to Air National Guard (ANG) units. Income and expenditures
   are the same as for installation MWR funds. (See Chapter 11.)
3.6. Command Lodging Funds. Each MAJCOM has a command lodging fund. It allows the
use of command-wide resources for needed base lodging improvements (see AFI 34-601, Air
Force Lodging Program).
   3.6.1. Don't invest base-level lodging funds. The command lodging fund has the only
   savings account for lodging funds in the command. It receives all interest earned, including
   that on the CMIP demand deposits.
   3.6.2. Each base-level lodging fund maintains CMIP deposits to cover normal operating
   expenses. If the MAJCOM determines it necessary, it may move excess funds to the
   command lodging fund to fund capital expenditures or provide operating capital for needy
   bases. Grants are the normal source of funds for capital expenditures or for operating capital
   at needy bases.
3.7. Base Lodging NAFIs. Each base establishes a lodging NAFI with the approval of the
MAJCOM.
   3.7.1. Activities within a base lodging NAFI operate on a self-sustaining basis as indicated
   by the lodging fund profit and loss statement. This operation focuses on achieving the
   financial indicators established by HQ USAF/SV for the lodging NAFI. Set daily service
   charge rates according to AFI 34-601.
   3.7.2. Small lodging activities (maximum of 15 rooms) may be satellites of another base's
   lodging NAFI when approved by HQ AFSVA/CC. Small lodging activities established
   before 1 Feb 1991 currently being operated under an MWR fund are "grandfathered."
   3.7.3. Transfer lodging funds (through the command lodging fund) from one base lodging
   fund to another within the command to help needy bases and improve lodging services.
AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010                                                                21


   3.7.4. Establish temporary lodging facility (TLF) charges to provide enough cash to pay the
   assessment, cover operating expenses, and provide for capital requirements or improvements.
   Do not generate any extra cash.
3.8. Air Force Fisher Houses (Special NAFIs). Fisher Houses provide temporary lodging for
families of patients who are hospitalized for complicated or critical medical problems.
   3.8.1. NAFs provide support to Fisher Houses through supplemental mission support NAFIs
   that operate as TLFs. Treat them as you would TLFs and lodging funds. The base lodging
   fund is the successor NAFI for Fisher Houses. Services supports the operation by providing
   accounting and contracting services .
       3.8.1.1. User fees, donations and gifts (with appropriate approvals), and APFs support
       Fisher Houses, as authorized. Services supports the operation by providing both
       accounting and contracting services through the NAF AO.
   3.8.2. The installation commander administers the NAFI.              Overall responsibility for
   operations rests with Medical Treatment Facility commander.
   3.8.3. The Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) commander initiates the request for the special
   NAFI charter. Overall responsibility for the operation rests with the MTF commander. The
   MTF commander is a voting member of the base NAFs Council at locations with Fisher
   Houses.
3.9. Commandants' School Mission Support Funds (CSMSFs). CSMSFs provide services
for students and faculty of Air Force schools and aid in military career education and training.
Use these NAFs to directly contribute to the schools' missions.
   3.9.1. "Commandant" is the head of an Air Force school, commander of a training center or
   base, or Superintendent, USAFA. MAJCOMs identify the commandants.
   3.9.2. MAJCOM/CC approves the establishment or dissolution of such NAFIs at base level.
   3.9.3. Identify CSMSFs by the official school and base designation; for example,
   Commandant's School Mission Support Fund, USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Air
   Force Materiel Command, Brooks AFB TX 78235-5000.
   3.9.4. Authorized expenses in support of the school's mission are:
       3.9.4.1. Cost-conscious development or improvement of training and educational
       materials.
       3.9.4.2. Payments to civilian and retired military speakers and lecturers participating in
       official school functions and contributing to the curriculum.
       3.9.4.3. Minimal incidental expenses for distinguished speakers and guests designated by
       the commandant. Keep expenditures conservative and limit expenditures to the same
       kinds of purchases authorized from special morale and welfare funds (SM&W) (see
       Chapter 12).
       3.9.4.4. Awards for instructor and student incentive programs associated with the
       school's mission.
   3.9.5. The MAJCOM MWRF is the successor NAFI for command CSMSFs.

3.10. United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Athletic Association and Cadet Dining
Hall Funds. The Superintendent, USAFA, directly controls, operates, and supervises these
NAFIs. They are not part of the Air Force MWR Program for purposes of APF reporting and
other limitations.
   3.10.1. (Added-USAFA) United States Air Force Academy Athletic Association. The
   AFAAA is a Supplemental Mission Support Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI)
   within the Air Force MWR program authorized in DoDI 1015.15., Establishment,
   Management, and Control of Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, and Financial
   Management of Supporting Resources. The AFAAA is under the direct control of the
   Superintendent of the USAFA. The USAFA athletic program supports the mental, physical,
   and character development of all cadets and is an integral part of the USAFA education and
   training process. The AFAAA is NAFI authorized and established for the purpose of
   providing supplemental support to the athletic program. The Director of Athletics is
   responsible to the Superintendent for the day-to-day operations of the AFAAA and
   management and operation of the following: (a) gift shops, (b) ticket office and sales, (c)
   food and beverage, (d) the Cadet Field House and Falcon Stadium, (e) AFAAA trademark
   licensing, (f) AFAAA-assigned housing and dormitory, (g) commercial sponsorship provided
   to the AFAAA, and (h) maintenance and repair of AFAAA funded supplies and equipment.
   The Director of Athletics will be responsible for preparing and submitting regular budgets for
   the AFAAA Fund in accordance with Air Force guidance on budget control. (See AFI 34-
   209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting, and AFMAN 34-214,
   Procedures for Nonappropriated Funds and Financial Management and Accounting). The
   AFAAA will report their operating budget to the Air Force MWR Advisory Board Finance
   and Audit Committee annually. Operations and activities of the AFAAA will be in
   accordance with the directives and requirements applicable to other Air Force NAFIs (which
   include but are not limited to DoD 5500.7-R and all other DoD Policy and Air Force Policy).
   In the event of conflict between government directives and National Collegiate Athletic
   Association (NCAA) rules, the Directorate of Athletics and the AFAAA must follow the
   government directives applicable or request a waiver of the conflicting government
   directives. Pending approval of any such waiver requests, AFAAA must continue to follow
   all the applicable government directives.
      3.10.1.1. (Added-USAFA) AFAAA Objective. The objective of the AFAAA is to
      provide supplemental financial support to the USAFA athletic program in order to
      enhance the public image of the USAF by presenting the USAFA's intercollegiate sports
      program to the general public. In order to accomplish this objective, the AFAAA
      generates NAF money to pay for necessary athletic program expenses for mission-related
      and revenue-generating activities identified in the approved Memorandum of Agreement
      for Appropriated Funding to Reimburse the AFAAA, between USAFA/AD and the
      AFAAA (signed document is maintained by USAFA/ADF).
      3.10.1.2. (Added-USAFA) Revenue Sources. The AFAAA generates NAF revenue
      from a variety of different sources. The AFAAA currently generates revenue from the
      sale of USAFA intercollegiate sporting event tickets to the military community and the
      general public, sale of broadcast rights (television and radio) to intercollegiate sporting
      events, the operation of gift shops, the sale of paid advertising, commercial sponsorship,
      the sale of concession items at athletic events, interest from authorized bank accounts,

       revenue received on a share basis from athletic conference, football games, tournaments,
       and sports camp fees.
3.11. HQ USAF Special Fund (Pentagon). This NAFI receives income from the DoD
Concession Committee. Its income supports the SAF and HQ USAF Welfare and Recreation
Activities.

Section 3C—Dissolving NAFIs

3.12. Basic Procedures.

                                         Chapter 4

                             WHAT NAFS COVER AND DON

4.1. Basic Criteria for Using NAFs. NAFs provide goods, services, facilities, equipment, and
manpower for MWR programs and activities. Use NAFs for other purposes only as permitted in
this and other AFIs. Do not use NAFs for any purpose unless such use is allowed in the general
authorization above or elsewhere in this or other AFIs. The absence of a prohibition on a
specific use of NAFs does not provide the authority to use NAFs.
   4.1.1. Don't use NAFs for purchases requiring interest payments (other than those required
   by law) or carrying charges to non-Government entities.
   4.1.2. When APFs are not available, the commander may approve the conservative use of
   NAFs for paying dues or fees in professional, scientific, or technical societies and
   associations for personnel who act as Air Force liaison to those organizations. Only pay for
   organizational or "desk" memberships and purchase no more than one membership per base,
   MAJCOM, FOA, or Air Staff for any given professional, scientific, or technical society or
   association.
   4.1.3. Use NAFs to support an MWR sponsored coupon program to promote participation in
   MWR activities. The Services squadron commander or director approves and sets the value
   of all MWR coupons. Control coupons according to AFI 34-202.
   4.1.4. Use NAFs for promotional mailings including postage when related to the sale of
   merchandise and services (see paragraph 9.4).
   4.1.5. The use of NAFs to pay registration fees is the same as for APFs (see AFI 65-601V1,
   US Air Force Budget Policies and Procedures).
   4.1.6. When APFs are authorized, use NAFs to purchase equipment for MWR activities only
   in an emergency. The installation commander certifies and identifies the emergency in
   writing and approves waivers to use NAFs instead of APFs for the purchase.
   4.1.7. (Added) When NAF capital expenditures of more than one million dollars are being
   planned for Category C activities, the Public-Private Venture (PPV) alternative must be
   considered as prescribed in AFI 64-301, Nonappropriated Fund Contracting Policy,
   paragraph 8. Before accomplishing an economic analysis consider the effect of the potential
   PPVon the benefit or mission involved and the impact on authorized patrons, the MWR
   program, and the local community. Where an economic analysis is required to determine best
   value for the Air Force, refer to the economic analysis programs on the HQ AFSVA web site
   at http://www-r.afsva.af.mil (under Financial Management). Any PPV contract/agreement
   requires prior written approval from HQ USAF/ILV.
   4.1.8. (Added-USAFA) The AFAAA may provide supplemental NAF support to the
   USAFA Directorate of Athletics’ mission-related and revenue-generating activities as
   identified in the approved Memorandum of Agreement for Appropriated Funding to
   Reimburse the AFAAA, in accordance with the basic AFI and this supplement. The Director
   of Athletics (AFAAA Fund Custodian) must ensure AFAAA assets are only used to support
   activities that reflect favorably on the USAF and the Department of Defense.
26                                                    AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010


  4.1.9. (Added-USAFA) AFAAA Public relations and recruiting are an appropriated fund
  responsibility. NAFs may be used for supplemental support on a conservative basis only
  when they are in the best interest of the Air Force and related directly to the USAFA
  intercollegiate sports program.
  4.1.10. (Added-USAFA) Hosting Prospective Cadet Athletes. The USAFA intercollegiate
  sports program is subject to the NCAA rules regarding recruiting. Civilian education
  institutions in the NCAA program are allowed to expend nominal amounts for meals,
  lodging, and transportation for prospective cadet athletes. AFAAA NAFs may be used to
  cover these expenses for intercollegiate sports program cadet candidates as long as such
  purchases are conservative and consistent with NCAA rules.
  4.1.11. (Added-USAFA) AFAAA NAFs may be used for travel, lodging, and per diem
  expenses at the government rate for NAF employees, when performing official business
  approved by the Director of Athletics. In addition, AFAAA NAFs may be used to provide
  team support for the USAFA's intercollegiate sports program when the USAFA Comptroller
  certifies that APFs are not available or are not authorized. AFAAA NAFs may be used to
  pay travel expenses for contractors in accordance with their contracts.
  4.1.12. (Added-USAFA) AFAAA NAFs may be used to purchase gifts of nominal value
  ($20.00) for visiting Athletic Directors from opposing teams at USAFA intercollegiate sports
  home events.
  4.1.13. (Added-USAFA) The USAFA is an open base and attracts a large volume of
  visitors each year. In an effort to broaden public awareness of the USAFA and the USAFA
  Directorate of Athletics, authorized users of the AFAAA Gift Shops and other resale
  activities may serve authorized MWR patrons, members of the public, and non-Department
  of Defense personnel.
  4.1.14. (Added-USAFA) NAFs may be used to purchase professionally printed business
  cards for Directorate of Athletics’ personnel and contractors involved in USAFA
  intercollegiate sports recruiting, marketing, development and public relations for the
  intercollegiate sports program when approved by the Director of Athletics.
  4.1.15. (Added-USAFA) The AFAAA NAFs may be used for training and professional
  courses for Directorate of Athletics’ personnel when the training directly relates to operations
  normally funded by AFAAA NAFs.
  4.1.16. (Added-USAFA) The AFAAA may use NAF assets for financial transactions in
  Partnership Agreements with commercial concerns as defined in AFMAN 64-302,
  Nonappropriated Fund Contracting, and the USAFA supplement, AFMAN 64-302 USAFA
  Supplement 1, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Contracting Procedures.
  4.1.17. (Added-USAFA) AFAAA NAFs derived from the NCAA allocation may be used
  for Academic Enhancement Programs and other educationally beneficial programs, which
  assist cadets engaged in intercollegiate sports in maintaining academic and military
  standards. This program is dedicated to tutoring cadet athletes but also benefits the cadet
  wing with educationally beneficial programs such as drug and alcohol abuse awareness,
  gambling issues, etc.
AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010                                                               27


  4.1.18. (Added-USAFA) With the approval of the Director of Athletics, AFAAA NAFs
  may be used to purchase food and lodging in the local USAFA area for intercollegiate cadet-
  athletes when scheduling of practices and (or) competitions precludes use of the Cadet
  Dining Facility, or where other special circumstances or requirements make Academy
  messing and lodging facility use impracticable. This authority, when applicable, extends to
  all NCAA, Division I sports teams at the USAFA, for the following and substantially similar
  situations:
     4.1.18.1. (Added-USAFA) When the Cadet Dining Facility is closed for holidays
     (Thanksgiving or semester holiday breaks) and intercollegiate cadets remain at the
     Academy for practice or competition.
     4.1.18.2. (Added-USAFA) On the day of, and the day prior to, home football games for
     pre-game planning meetings/meals and a post-game snack; and other Academy
     intercollegiate teams for unusually significant contests (conference tournaments, post-
     season competition, NCAA Championships and Tournaments).
     4.1.18.3. (Added-USAFA) Pre- and (or) post-game meals when the schedule of
     practices or contests/games is such that meal(s) are not available in the Cadet Dining
     Facility.
     4.1.18.4. (Added-USAFA) Infrequent working or planning meetings/meals where the
     number of cadet-athletes and other participants, and audio-visual and other requirements
     make the use of the Cadet Dining Facility impracticable.
     4.1.18.5. (Added-USAFA) Extra meals or snacks during periods of extraordinary
     caloric consumption, e.g., pre-season two-a-day football practices.
     4.1.18.6. (Added-USAFA) Recruiting meals for cadet escorts when hosting prospective
     intercollegiate cadet athletes during authorized campus visits (see 4.1.10. (Added)).
  4.1.19. (Added-USAFA) AFAAA NAFs (only) may be used to purchase fruit, Gatorade,
  soda, and (or) bottled water for game/contest officials and visiting intercollegiate team
  personnel (players and staff) when required by contract or game/tournament guarantee and
  approved by the Director of Athletics.
  4.1.20. (Added-USAFA) AFAAA NAFs may be used to purchase meals for authorized
  Athletic Department Personnel in the local USAFA area when the meals are incidental to the
  performance of essential and official duties involving intercollegiate sports and the personnel
  are in working-breakfast, working-lunch, or working-dinner meetings when approved in
  advance by the Director of Athletics.
  4.1.21. (Added-USAFA) To ensure proper oversight of the use of the exceptional funding
  authorizations provided in the subparagraphs 4.1.9. through 4.1.12. and 4.1.14. through
  4.1.20. above, receipts and documentation reflecting the who, what, when, where, and funds
  expended will be retained and forwarded to the servicing NAF Accounting Office with every
  request for reimbursement.
  4.1.22. (Added-USAFA) To ensure fiscal responsibility, these expenditures to the greatest
  extent possible need to be recorded in the AFAAA monthly income and expense statement.
  Although the Athletic Association does have a specific financial performance goal, emphasis
 28                                                    AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010


      should be placed on breaking even and generating sufficient profits for future capital re-
      investments. This is in keeping with the language and intent of DoDI 1015.15.
   4.1.23. (Added-USAFA) Meal payments for prospective cadet-athletes on an official
   campus visit as defined by the NCAA will be limited to the maximum daily meal amount
   allowable by the JTR for Colorado Springs, Colorado. Meal payments for cadets and
   Academy staff will not exceed authorized per meal amounts. EXCEPTION: For pre-game
   meals and combined (breakfast-lunch or lunch-dinner) training meals authorized in paragraph
   4.1.18. (Added), the payment limit is the current dinner rate. Total payment for a cadet or
   Academy staff member in any day will not exceed the proportional meal rate contained in the
   JFTR.
   4.1.24. (Added-USAFA) Participation Awards, Championship Awards and Special
   Achievement Awards. AFAAA NAFs may be used to purchase awards for cadets, coaches
   and selected staff personnel (defined below). The value of these awards will not exceed the
   limits established by the NCAA. Awards are authorized when approved by HQ USAFA/CC
   as follows:
         4.1.24.1. (Added-USAFA) Annual special recognition or graduation awards for cadet-
         athletes and cadet managers. These awards are presented at season-ending or graduation
         ceremonies and include plaques, statuettes, pictures, framed mementos, jackets, blankets
         or watches and are authorized when NCAA rules permit such institutionally funded
         awards.
         4.1.24.2. (Added-USAFA) Conference or NCAA Championship awards for cadets and

         4.1.24.3. (Added-USAFA) Football bowl game awards (Bowl Memorabilia Package
         and institutional team awards) for cadets, coaches and selected support staff. These
         awards are authorized when a team participates in a post-season bowl game and the

         for a full package; support staff who are assigned duties with the team and are on the
         team travel roster (athletic medical trainers, sports information (media relations)

         video personnel) are authorized a partial package.
         4.1.24.4. (Added-USAFA) Post-season tournament or championship participation
         awards. These awards are authorized for teams (other than football) and individuals

  authorized by the MAJCOM/CC (or the installation commander, if so delegated).
  4.3.6. Organizational memberships or user fees to civilian recreation facilities for units
  where Air Force or other military facilities are not reasonably accessible when APFs aren't
  authorized. Use NAFs on a conservative basis for organizational memberships; use neither
  APFs nor NAFs for individual memberships. (AFI 65-601, US Air Force Budget Policies
  and Procedures, governs use of APFs for organizational memberships in fitness facilities and
  similar organizations.)
     4.3.6.1. Before authorizing NAFs for this purpose, ensure that:
         4.3.6.1.1. Personnel are members of a unit that receives MWR fund support.
         4.3.6.1.2. Personnel are active duty military and civilian personnel assigned or

      - Space is not available in the child development center.
      - The installation commander authorizes it (see AFI 34-209 for accounting procedures).
      4.3.9.2. Commanders ensure that volunteers don't abuse the child care development
      services privilege and that its cost doesn't harm the financial operation of the base MWR
      fund.
      4.3.9.3. Pay the family day care home providers directly, rather than giving funds to the
      volunteers.
   4.3.10. Family Services programs, including items for lending closets, uniforms, awards,

               NAFI TRANSFERS, DONATIONS, AND CONTRIBUTIONS

Section 5A—Transfers

5.1. Transfer of Assets. Transfer assets (cash, inventory, and property) to, from, or between
NAFIs and activities only under the conditions or limitations set in this paragraph and AFI 34-
204. See AFI 34-209 for inventory and property transfer procedures.
   5.1.1. The major or installation commander who has jurisdiction over the activities or NAFIs
   involved ensures that such transfers are mutually beneficial to both activities or NAFIs.
   EXCEPTION: Where the transfer is from a NAFI at one base to a NAFI at another base when
   justified by the "common cause approach."
   5.1.2. Keep the major commander's determination in the life-of-fund files.
       5.1.2.1. HQ USAF/SV approves transfers of:
          5.1.2.1.1. MWR fund cash assets to any other type of NAFI.

       or equipment), and give justification and any relevant comments.
   5.1.4. Do not transfer assets from one NAFI to another or from one activity to another in the
   same NAFI just to improve the apparent financial condition or position of the losing or
   gaining NAFI or activity.
5.2. Inter-NAFI Transfers. Inter-NAFI transfers are the actual transfers of NAF assets to other
NAFIs, such as:
   - Disposal of residual assets (sale, donation, or transfer).
   - Redistribution of excess assets (including cash).
   - Adjustments when bases are transferred from one MAJCOM to another.
   5.2.1. Transfers are at book value, at fair market value, or at an appropriate value in
   between.

       welfare fund, or base restaurant fund) or vice versa except at fair market value.
       5.2.1.2. The RMFC and applicable manager, with help from the DRMO or the servicing
       contracting officer, determine the fair market value.
 34                                                    AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010


       5.2.1.3. The gaining NAFI pays the mutually agreed upon value of the asset.
   5.2.2. The MAJCOM commander approves the transfer of NAF assets from a base-level
   NAFI to a NAFI of the same type at another base within the command. The commander may

within the same NAFI.
   5.3.1. Transfers are at book value and include moving associated income or expenses.
5.4. Loaning Assets.
   5.4.1. NAFIs can loan property to another activity or NAFI for up to 30 days before the
   assets must be transferred.
       5.4.1.1. For periods over 30 days and for loans of indefinite duration, the activity
       manager (through the RMFC) transfers assets using procedures in AFI 34-209. The NAF
       AO changes the depreciation to the activity using the property.
5.5. Transfers to APF Accounts. The Services squadron commander or director authorizes the
transfer of Table of Allowance (TA) property items purchased with NAFs to APF accounts.

   of non-MWR activities.
       5.5.5.1. MAJCOMs consider each transfer of excess NAF property to non-MWR
       activities on a case-by-case basis. MAJCOM/CC or MAJCOM-level designee approves
       the transfer of NAF-purchased property at MAJCOM- or base-level to APF accounts of
       non-MWR activities.
       5.5.5.2. When property is approved for transfer, stop using NAFs to maintain or replace
       it.
5.6. Base or Organization Transfers.
   5.6.1. Assets and liabilities transfer when the MAJCOM assumes jurisdiction, if a base is
   transferred from one MAJCOM to another.

   5.6.2. A proportionate share of net current assets may transfer with a base organization that
   is transferred to a base of another command, if the losing commander approves. Determine
   the net current assets (current assets less current liabilities) as of a mutually agreed-upon
   date.
      5.6.2.1. The AFMWRAB chairman sets the maximum amount of NAFs that a losing
      command may withdraw from base-level NAFIs when a base is transferred from one
      command to another and when the gaining command does not agree with the amount of
      the withdrawal.
   5.6.3. The NAFIs on a base transferred to another Service or US Government agency curtail
   expenditures, cancel contracts, and pay all outstanding obligations.
      5.6.3.1. The major commander or designee negotiates the transfer of NAFI property,
      equipment, and inventories with the gaining Service or agency.

Section 5B—Contributions and Donations

5.7. Approval for Contributions and Donations.
   5.7.1. Contributions and donations require approval before they are accepted for a NAFI.
   Who approves acceptance of contributions, donations, and commercial sponsorship depends
   upon the value of the gift:
      5.7.1.1. The installation commander approves for items valued at $1,000 or less and
      items from the Combined Federal Campaign Fund. He or she may delegate, in writing,
      all or part of this authority to the Services squadron commander or director.
      5.7.1.2. The MAJCOM commander approves for items valued over $1,000 up to and

          contributions and donations up to and including $250,000 for the AFAAA. Prior to
          acceptance, all AFAAA contributions and donations will be coordinated with the
          Headquarters USAFA Staff Judge Advocate (HQ USAFA/JA). Procedures for
          acceptance of gifts are outlined in Chapter 5, Section 5B.
              5.7.1.2.1.1. (Added-USAFA) An offer of a conditional or unconditional
              contribution or donation must be, in writing, and should contain sufficient
              information to document the nature of the contribution or donation and any
              restrictions that may apply. The approving authority will accept the contribution
              or the donation. The supporting documentation will be maintained by the NAF
              Accounting Office in the life-of-the-fund file.
      5.7.1.3. AFSVA/CC approves for items valued over $25,000 up to and including
      $100,000.
      5.7.1.4. The AFMWRAB chairman approves for items valued over $100,000.
   5.7.2. The Board of Directors, AAFCWF, approves contributions, donations, and transfer of

5.8. Using Contributions and Donations. Use contributions or donations to a NAFI for the
purposes specified (for example, if you accept a $400 contribution to purchase a video player for
the library, you must use those funds for that purchase).
   5.8.1. Use contributions or donations to a NAFI without a specified purpose to provide new
   programs, supplies, equipment and other direct benefits for authorized users.
       5.8.1.1. Do not use these funds for facility maintenance or repair, payroll, and so forth.
   5.8.2. Do not solicit contributions and donations and do not grant the donor or contributor
   any special favors or privileges.
       5.8.2.1. Limit the public acknowledgment to a one-time mention in the applicable base
       newspaper, a "thank-you" letter or ceremony, and an appropriate "donated by" name plate
       on the item.
   5.8.3. Never charge the cost of contributions or donations to a Government contract.
   5.8.4. Do not accept property unless the donor relinquishes ownership rights (in writing).

   and alcohol) valued at less than $20 retail when suppliers voluntarily offer them for use by or
   distribution to authorized customers.
   5.9.2. Examples of premiums are donated ballpoint pens, plastic rulers, tee shirts, and other
   items of nominal value which may identify the commercial donor's name or products or
   services.
   5.9.3. Miscellaneous advertising items include donated place mats, napkins, score sheets,
   scorecards, and other similar items of nominal value. These items may identify the

                        REAL PROPERTY AND CONSTRUCTION

6.1. Using NAFs for Real Property and Construction.
   6.1.1. For guidance on using NAFs for real property and construction, see this chapter; AFI
   34-105, Programming For Services Facility Requirements; and AFI 32-1022, Planning and
   Programming of NAF Facility Construction Programs.
   6.1.2. Do not use NAFs to design and construct, alter, recondition, renovate, repair,
   maintain, or add to Government-owned or -leased structures when APFs are authorized. See
   AFI 65-106 and AFI 32-1022.
6.2. Capital Improvements. The Air Force Base Capital Improvement Fund (AFBCIF) is the
source of funding for NAF capital improvement grants, when funds are not available at base or
MAJCOM level.
   6.2.1. Approval for NAF grants for capital improvement projects depends upon:
       6.2.1.1. Lack of local funds.
       6.2.1.2. Priority of overall Air Force need.
   6.2.2. The CSAF approves capital improvement grants over $200,000.
   6.2.3. Conduct a needs assessment for all NAF capital improvement projects (see AFI 34-
   105, Programming For Services Facility Requirements).
6.3. Architect-Engineering Services. NAFs usually fund these services for NAF projects, but
using in-house civil engineering design resources is permitted if it requires no additional
manpower authorizations.
6.4. Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH) Services. Use NAFs for SIOH of NAF
projects when these services are contracted (including Corp of Engineers) or done by other than
base-level staff, or when base civil engineers can't perform in-house and must hire additional
personnel to perform SIOH.
6.5. Leasing Real Property. The MAJCOM/CC approves the use of NAFs for leasing real
property for amounts up to and including $100,000. HQ USAF/SV approves amounts over
$100,000.
   6.5.1. Requests for approval of proposed lease agreements must contain the lease agreement
   and support information (see AFI 32-1022). The servicing judge advocate's (JA) office
   reviews them for compliance with AFI 64-301.
   6.5.2. Acquire, execute, and administer the lease in the NAFI's name and stipulate that
   Government lease obligations will be paid solely by NAFs.
6.6. Limitations on Construction.
   6.6.1. A building or structure constructed or purchased with NAFs will not be diverted to a
   use other than in direct support of MWR activities without prior approval from HQ
   USAF/SV.
38                                                   AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010


  6.6.2. Process net proceeds from the sale of a building or structure acquired or constructed
  with NAFs and later sold upon disposition of Government property in accordance with
  Public Law 102-190, section 344, and Public Law, 102-484, section 2821.
  6.6.3. AFBCIF Project Completion Report (RCS: HAF-SV[AR] 9468). Within 30 days
  after completing a project constructed with an AFBCIF grant, the Services squadron
  commander or director submits a completion report to HQ AFSVA/SVQF. This report is
  designated emergency status code C3. Continue reporting during emergency conditions,
  delayed precedence. Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they may be delayed to
  allow the submission of higher precedence reports. During emergency conditions, submit by
  nonelectronic means, if possible. Discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE. The report
  contains:
     6.6.3.1. The project title.
     6.6.3.2. The total project cost.
     6.6.3.3. The date construction was completed.
     6.6.3.4. The date of beneficial occupancy.
     6.6.3.5. Any remaining bills to be paid on the project.

                                         Chapter 7

                                    NAF EMPLOYEES

7.1. What NAFs Cover. Use NAFs to pay the salaries, wages, and benefits of people who
operate MWR and lodging programs and facilities.
   7.1.1. Manpower standards identify areas that APFs cover. Don't use NAFs in lieu of APFs
   for those positions.
   7.1.2. For positions supporting MWR Fund activities, the MAJCOM SV/FM may approve
   waivers to use NAFs in lieu of APFs on a case-by-case basis (see Attachment 5).
   7.1.3. For positions supporting lodging fund activities, SAF/FMPB approves waivers.
   7.1.4. See AFI 34-301, NAF Personnel Management and Administration, for policies on pay
   administration and entitlements of NAF personnel.
7.2. Overpayment of Wages, Allowances, Differentials, or Benefits. The custodian collects
overpayments in allowances, differentials, or benefits made to NAF employees (see AFI 34-
202).
   7.2.1. See AFI 34-209 for overdrawn leave.
   7.2.2. Waiver authorities for recouping overpayment of wages are:
      7.2.2.1. The installation commander for amounts up to and including $1,000.

   support and operate programs.
   7.4.2. For individual services contracts that don't involve an employer-employee
   relationship.
   7.4.3. To pay active duty commissioned officers through individual services contracts for
   work not associated with their Air Force responsibilities.

                                          Chapter 8

                                           TAXES

8.1. Tax Payments.
   8.1.1. NAFIs must collect, report, and pay all Federal taxes required by law. Send tax
   payment checks when due to the designated tax collector.
   8.1.2. Report disputes involving taxes to AFLSA/JACL (see AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation).
   Forward a copy to HQ AFSVA/SVL.
8.2. Federal Taxes.
   8.2.1. The Director of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sets regulations for withholding,
   depositing, paying, and reporting Federal taxes. For general tax guidance on income and
   Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes, see IRS Circular E and AFI 34-209.
   8.2.2. In the United States, NAFIs that sell alcoholic beverages or beer must have the
   appropriate occupational tax stamp as a wholesale beer dealer, retail beer dealer, wholesale
   liquor dealer, or retail liquor dealer (see AFI 34-119).
8.3. State and Local Taxes.
   8.3.1. As instrumentalities of the United States, NAFIs have the same immunity from state
   and local taxes as the rest of the Federal Government. However, procedures for withholding
   and paying NAF employees' state and local income taxes must conform to the policy
   applicable to APF employees of the Air Force at the same location.
   8.3.2. On any other tax questions involving non-Federal taxing authorities, NAFI custodians
   consult their local servicing JA office.
8.4. Applying State and Local Taxes to Petty Cash Purchases.
   8.4.1. The NAF AO obtains an opinion from its servicing JA office on whether local vendors
   may charge amounts covering state and local tax on NAFI petty cash purchases. Such
   charges are permissible when the legal incidence of the taxes does not fall on the purchasing
   NAFI.
   8.4.2. Where the amounts covering state and local taxes are legally charged to the
   purchasing NAFI, the purchasing individual pays them and is reimbursed for the amounts
   paid.
   8.4.3. Where the amounts covering state and local taxes can't be legally charged to the
   purchasing NAFI (that is, when the legal incidence of the tax falls on the purchasing NAFI),
   the following requirements apply:
      8.4.3.1. The individual making the NAF purchase tells the vendor that the purchase is for
      an Air Force NAFI and asks that it be tax-free. If the item costs more than a nominal
      amount ($25), the individual normally must provide the vendor with a certification from
      the servicing JA office or the NAF AO that:
          8.4.3.1.1. The purchasing NAFI is an instrumentality of the United States.
AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010                                                              41


           8.4.3.1.2. It is exempt from state and local taxes. Get the certification from the
           servicing JA office or the NAF AO.
       8.4.3.2. If the vendor insists on charging the taxes, then the purchaser should consider
       going elsewhere. If the vendor is the only source for the item or good judgment indicates
       that the amount involved doesn't justify the effort of going elsewhere, go ahead and make
       the purchase. NAFs will reimburse the full amount.
8.5. Interest and Penalty Payments. As a general rule, one Federal agency may not assess
interest and penalties against another, except where specifically authorized by law.
   8.5.1. NAFIs must pay interest and penalty assessments under Federal law where the
   amounts are payable to an individual rather than to the Government. Examples are the
   interest and penalties paid to a claimant that are required under the NAF Workers'
   Compensation Program by the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.
   8.5.2. Before payment, the servicing JA office reviews any interest or penalty charges
   assessed against a NAFI by another Federal agency or instrumentality. The servicing JA
   office or HQ AFSVA/ SVL can help you respond to the Federal agency.
8.6. Taxes Levied by Foreign Governments. NAFIs usually are exempt from foreign duties
and taxes, either by the express provisions of an international agreement or by recognition that
they are United States instrumentalities. Report any attempted taxation by foreign countries or
their political subdivisions to AFSLA/JACL as required by AFI 51-301. Send a copy to HQ
AFSVA/SVL.
8.7. Collecting Taxes for Foreign Governments. NAFIs have no authority to collect taxes for
a foreign government unless the United States has consented to do so by international agreement.
8.8. Tax Reporting for Personal Services Contracts, Awards, Bingo, and Prizes. NAFIs
report the amount paid to any individual when it exceeds a specified dollar amount. See AFI 34-
209 for accounting procedures. The guidance in this paragraph applies to personal services
contracts, awards, bingo, and prizes.
   8.8.1. The NAFI reports NAF personal services contracts, including contracts with
   entertainers, that add up to $600 or more during a calendar year. Report to the IRS on IRS
   Form 1099 MISC.
   8.8.2. A NAFI must report to the IRS any person who receives cash, prizes, or awards from
   a NAFI for contests, including sporting events and commercial sponsorship, that total $600
   or more in any calendar year. Winnings include the fair market value of payment in any
   form other than cash (for example, a car, golf cart, television, golf clubs).
   8.8.3. A NAFI must report to the IRS any person who receives a payment of $1,200 or more
   from one bingo game. Determine the value of such winnings as follows:
       8.8.3.1. Don't subtract the selling price of one or more bingo cards for that game from
       the amount of the winnings.
       8.8.3.2. Total all the individual's winnings from one bingo game. If the winner uses two
       or more cards in the same game or receives other payments on a bingo card while playing
       one game, the individual could be a multiple winner in that one game.

     8.8.3.3. Don't include winnings and losses from any other games the winner played; for
     example, winnings on preceding or succeeding games do not accumulate for reporting
     purposes.

                                  SPECIAL USES OF NAFS

9.1. Trophies and Awards. The guidance in this paragraph applies when you purchase trophies
and awards with NAFs. Awards involving any form of NAFI profit-sharing are prohibited.
Expenditures are made only when:
   - APFs aren't authorized.
   - The activities or programs aren't mission-related.
   - This chapter authorizes the use of NAFs.
   9.1.1. Use NAFs to purchase trophies and awards for:
      9.1.1.1. Competitive excellence in specified activities and programs.
      9.1.1.2. Individual recognition of achievements authorized by Air Force instructions.
   9.1.2. Use MWR NAFs for:
      9.1.2.1. Trophies, plaques, US savings bonds, property, and cash awards for recreational
      competitive contests and events that are:
          9.1.2.1.1. Officially announced in advance.
          9.1.2.1.2. Conducted within a stated period.
          9.1.2.1.3. Open equally to all eligible people and organizations that the NAFI
          supports.
      9.1.2.2. For volunteers in the Family Services program and the MWR program.
      9.1.2.3. For recognizing participation achievement; for example, complimentary pin or
      patch for bowling a 200 game or 500 series.
   9.1.3. Use NAF funds to pay for the following awards:
      9.1.3.1. For individual recognition programs when approved by the commander
      according to Chapter 12.
      9.1.3.2. For NAF employee incentive award and recognition programs.
      9.1.3.3. For NAF employees participating in the NAFI suggestion program (see AFI 34-
      301).
   9.1.4. Use CSMSFs for awards for instructor and student incentive programs associated with
   the school's mission.
   9.1.5. To ensure a consistent awards program:
      9.1.5.1. Make the award commensurate with the achievement or accomplishment.
      9.1.5.2. Make sure accomplishment and competition awards are officially established,
      announced, and (usually) of a continuing nature. Give awards annually, unless you wish
      to honor a unique accomplishment or when more frequent awards would clearly benefit
      the program.
 44                                                  AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010


      9.1.5.3. Set processing, evaluation, and award procedures to minimize administrative or
      temporary duty (TDY) costs or both.
      9.1.5.4. Limit the number of trophies, plaques, useful property awards, and similar items,
      as necessary.
   9.1.6. The Services squadron commander or director annually reviews all award programs
   and decides whether they warrant continuation, as part of the NAF budget process.
   9.1.7. The support group commander approves limits on cash or merchandise awards for
   sports and recreational events. For such events:
      9.1.7.1. Publicize all events to attract as many participants as possible and avoid
      preferential treatment for a select few.
      9.1.7.2. Award only accomplishments achieved in sanctioned play, tournaments, or
      events rather than open, free, or unsupervised activities.
      9.1.7.3. Evaluate the cost of each award against the value of awards from sponsoring
      associations that recognize the same kind of accomplishment (for example, an American
      Bowling Congress award for bowling a 300 game).
      9.1.7.4. Require competitors to acknowledge, in writing, that they understand that
      accepting cash prizes could void their amateur status.
      9.1.7.5. Be prepared to give alternative awards, such as plaques, to those who decline
      cash. (See Chapter 8 for payment of taxes and other AFI 34-series instructions for any
      further limitations on awards for sport competitions.)
   9.1.8. In addition to cash or property, awards may include coupons for rounds of golf, lines
   of bowling, or free use of other MWR activities. The Services squadron commander
   approves such awards.
9.2. Travel and Transportation.
   9.2.1. Temporary duty (TDY) travel with APFs is authorized for a NAF employee when an
   authorized DoD official directs the travel and it is related to business supported by APFs.
   Publish special orders for travel as required by AFI 37-128, Administrative Orders (PA).
   9.2.2. The NAFI directing the travel pays for the travel expenses of NAF officials or
   employees traveling on NAF business; that is, the internal operations of the NAFI (as
   opposed to supervisory functions that are official Government business).
      9.2.2.1. Never use NAFs for travel to functions that the NAFI doesn't support. For
      example, don't use lodging funds for travel to a conference on family housing.
   9.2.3. All NAF employees traveling to an installation on official APF or NAF TDY travel
   orders should reserve lodging with the applicable base lodging activity whenever possible.
   NAF employees must get a DD Form 1351-5, Government Quarters and Mess, or an
   assignment to contract quarters if they can't get lodging reservations. Otherwise they won't
   get paid for the quarters portions of the per diem or actual expense allowance.
   9.2.4. Use APFs to transport NAF property (see AFI 65-106).
AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010                                                                 45


   9.2.5. Regular NAF employees selected for permanent change of station (PCS) transfer to a
   NAFI at another Air Force installation are allowed essential travel and transportation
   according to AFI 34-301.
   9.2.6. An individual traveling at NAF expense who receives a bonus coupon, a tangible
   article (for example, clock, radio, bag, golf balls), trading stamp discount document, or
   another ticket, turns the items in to the NAF AO or NAFI custodian. The traveler gets a
   receipt for the item.
       9.2.6.1. Travelers may enroll in "frequent flyers" or other mileage-accumulation
       programs to get free or discounted travel or airline seat upgrades that ultimately accrue to
       the NAFI. In addition, coupons, discount tickets, and other benefits help defray the cost
       of future NAF travel.
       9.2.6.2. Tangible items go to an appropriate MWR activity for use by authorized
       participants.
       9.2.6.3. Inventory accountability depends on the value of the item and its useful life (see
       AFI 34-209). When tangible items are received for APF travel, account for them
       according to AFI 34-209.
   9.2.7. Use NAFs to buy scheduled commercial airline tickets and recreational tourism
   services.
       9.2.7.1. Air carriers providing NAF-funded charter flights must:
          9.2.7.1.1. Be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
          9.2.7.1.2. Meet the requirements of part 121 of the FAA regulations.
          9.2.7.1.3. Be authorized by Air Mobility Command (AMC) to perform the services.
       9.2.7.2. Submit requests to charter air carriers using NAFs to HQ AMC/TRC, Scott AFB
       IL 62225-5001, 60 days before the chartered flight.
9.3. Fund-Raising Events. See AFI 34-101.
9.4. NAFI Advertising. NAFIs, whether engaged in resale or not, communicate their presence
and the goods and services they offer to as many authorized potential customers as they can.
   9.4.1. Advertising must not reflect unfavorably on the NAFI, the Air Force, the DoD, and
   the Federal Government. See AFI 34-104 for specific guidance on advertising. Note: This
   advertising policy is separate and distinct from the MWR Commercial Sponsorship Policy
   (see AFI 34-207, Commercial Sponsorship Program).
   9.4.2. Only mail materials promoting the sale of specific commercial products or services to
   customers who voluntarily sign up to receive such advertising.
       9.4.2.1. This restriction applies to any mailings containing specific branded products or
       pricing information.
       9.4.2.2. Do not send mail-order catalogs under any circumstances.
   9.4.3. NAFs pay for the cost of promotional mailings including postage.
   9.4.4. NAFIs may:
46                                                    AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010


     9.4.4.1. Purchase or otherwise arrange for advertising produced primarily for distribution
     on the installation or to authorized customers.
     9.4.4.2. Purchase, prepare, or produce advertising items for supported activities (such as
     ballpoint pens or calendars) for distribution to authorized customers.
     9.4.4.3. Participate in coupon redemption programs offered to the general public or to the
     military community.        Administration and accounting costs associated with the
     redemption program may not exceed the benefits to customers and the NAFI.
  9.4.5. NAFIs may not sell space for commercial advertising. They may not accept any funds
  to offset the cost of advertising that is conditioned on excluding any other product, service, or
  advertisement or granting any additional benefit to a supplier.
     9.4.5.1. Advertising relating to a NAFI must contain a disclaimer if:
     - It is purchased by suppliers or other non-DoD sources.
     - It appears in a medium that the advertised NAFI didn't prepare or produce.
     9.4.5.1. (USAFA) The AFAAA may sell space for commercial advertising in any media
     (printed, signs, electronic) produced for or prepared by them, and they may accept
     payment for such advertising subject to the following conditions:
         9.4.5.1.1. The disclaimer must indicate that the advertisements do not express or
         imply endorsement by any part of the Federal Government and that the media
         involved are neither paid for nor sponsored by any part of the Federal Government.
         9.4.5.1.1. (USAFA) The advertising shall be identified as "Paid Advertising" and
         include a disclaimer that it does not constitute or imply endorsement by any part of
         the Federal Government.
             9.4.5.1.1.1. (Added-USAFA) Sample Paid Advertisement Disclaimer Language.
             The following is a sample of the language to be used: "The appearance of
             references to commercial firms or their goods or services in this
             (publication)(venue) does not constitute or imply a Federal endorsement of the
             firm or its goods or services being advertised."
     9.4.5.2. A disclaimer is not required for items provided as premiums.
  9.4.6. Activities may not initiate, sponsor, pay for, or request payment for advertising of
  particular goods or services, with these exceptions:
     9.4.6.1. Activities may purchase advertising to promote Services programs or activities
     in US Armed Forces newspapers and civilian enterprise publications (usually base
     newspapers) published primarily for distribution on a military installation, when
     authorized.
     9.4.6.2. The US Armed Forces installation or activity newspapers and American Forces
     Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) may carry unpaid noncommercial news stories,
     announcements, and listings of services that Services activities offer to command or
     activity personnel. In news stories and announcements concerning US Armed Forces
     professional entertainment events, Armed Forces newspapers (including Stars and
AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010                                                                 47


       Stripes), civilian enterprise publication, and AFRTS outlets, include the name of
       commercial sponsors with other story facts and appropriate disclaimers.
          9.4.6.2.1. (Added-USAFA) Acceptance of paid commercial advertising on Armed
          Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS), local commander’s channels, or any
          APF electronic media is prohibited.
          9.4.6.2.2. (Added-USAFA) Advertising in MWR media is based on reaching bona
          fide users in accordance with established patronage policies.
          9.4.6.2.3. (Added-USAFA) The MWR media is not distributed off the installation.
          Mailing to authorized patrons is permitted.
          9.4.6.2.4. (Added-USAFA) The disclaimer will be posted at or near the site of the
          advertising, or in prominent locations, such as the base entrances and where the
          advertising takes place, including, but not limited to, the entry points of sports
          venues. Disclaimers located with the advertisement shall be of a size that is
          proportionate to the size of the advertising and be of a style and font that is easily
          readable. Disclaimers located at entry points shall be of such size and style that make
          them easy to read.
   9.4.7. Services activities and programs may not produce, procure, distribute, or sell any
   media, printed or otherwise, containing commercial advertising (includes air show souvenir
   programs).
9.5. Open Houses and Air Shows. See AFI 34-101.
9.6. NAFI Vehicles. See AFI 34-204 for specific guidance.
   9.6.1. Use NAFI vehicles for official Services and NAFI purposes only. Don't use them for
   private business, unofficial purposes, or personal convenience.
   9.6.2. Don't use them for base protocol requirements unless the installation commander
   authorizes each use in writing.
       9.6.2.1. Each authorization states that the vehicle is being temporarily assigned to the
       protocol function and states the duration of the assignment.
       9.6.2.2. When used for protocol, the vehicle is serving an APF function and the NAF
       self-insurance liability program does not apply. Drivers must be in an official duty status.
   9.6.3. For NAF vehicles being used for APF functions:
       9.6.3.1. Always use an APF driver.
       9.6.3.2. Make sure that the proposed use doesn't conflict with the vehicle's primary NAF
       mission.
       9.6.3.3. Limit the vehicle's use to purposes approved for APF vehicles.
       9.6.3.4. Don't allow or require APF or NAF reimbursement.

                WAIVERS, EXCEPTIONS, AND SPECIAL APPROVALS

10.1. Waivers and Exceptions. Identify this paragraph as the authority for waiver of this AFI.
   10.1.1. MAJCOM supplements to Air Force instructions may limit specific base-level
   waiver authorities. MAJCOMs may not approve waivers that prescribe base-level actions,
   nor may they approve blanket waivers within their jurisdiction for their bases. Consider each
   waiver request separately.
   10.1.2. Only those procedures and guidelines that specifically reference this instruction are
   eligible for waiver.
   10.1.3. Waivers and exceptions to policy for civilian welfare funds and base restaurants
   require advance approval from the Board of Directors, AAFCWF (AFJI 34-122).
10.2. Submitting Requests for Air Force Approval.
   10.2.1. To get a waiver, special authorization, change in policy, or other such exception, first
   get approval for the request from the installation commander. If the request requires Air
   Force level approval, you may then forward the request (with justification) through the
   MAJCOM to HQ AFSVA/ SVQ for approval.
       10.2.1.1. (Added-USAFA) Waivers to the procedures contained in the basic or this
       supplement must be submitted through the Superintendent to Headquarters USAF
       Services Directorate (HQ USAF/A1S) for review and approval.
   10.2.2. HQ USAF/SV will approve or disapprove.
AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010                                                                 49


                                              Chapter 11

                              TENANT AND ISOLATED UNITS

11.1. Tenants and Hosts.
   11.1.1. A tenant is:
       11.1.1.1. A military organization of one service that occupies facilities on an installation
       under the jurisdiction of another service. (See DoDD 1015.1 for guidance on providing
       MWR fund benefits to tenant organizations of another service.)
       11.1.1.2. An Air Force organization of one MAJCOM or FOA located on or attached to
       an Air Force installation under the jurisdiction of another MAJCOM.
   11.1.2. The host is one of two entities:
       11.1.2.1. The MAJCOM that has jurisdiction over the installation or other real property
       that the tenant occupies.
       11.1.2.2. The organization that the host MAJCOM or HQ USAF designates to furnish
       tenant support.
   11.1.3. Host commanders oversee all aspects of MWR operations. They provide the same
   MWR services and benefits for tenants as for comparable organizations in their commands.
   11.1.4. A MAJCOM/SV may help meet unique requirements of an organization tenanted on
   facilities of another command when the parent command considers it necessary.
11.2. Isolated Units.
   11.2.1. An isolated unit is an organization that meets both of these criteria:
   - Isn't located on a military installation with MWR programs or isn't located within 15 miles
   of such an installation.
   - Does not receive an AAFES dividend distribution.
       11.2.1.1. Isolated units may also include:
          11.2.1.1.1. Security groups, recruiting, communication, or weather detachments.
          11.2.1.1.2. Military training groups at colleges and universities.
          11.2.1.1.3. Radar squadrons.
          11.2.1.1.4. Military advisory assistance groups operating in locations without NAF
          assistance (see AFI 16-104, Attache Affairs).
11.3. Getting MWR Support for Isolated Units. When a unit is within 15 miles of a military
installation with MWR programs, the unit receives its MWR support from that military
installation.
   11.3.1. Stipulate in a support agreement with the installation that the installation will:
       11.3.1.1. Provide access to installation MWR facilities and services.
       11.3.1.2. Allow the isolated unit full participation in MWR programs.
 50                                                      AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010


         11.3.1.3. Provide other support as established by the installation commander.
   11.3.2. Report problems in obtaining needed support through command channels for
   resolution.
   11.3.3. On-the-spot assistance on MWR matters is available to smaller units that can't
   employ personnel or are not authorized assigned personnel for MWR programs.
11.4. Establishing an Isolated Unit.
   11.4.1. An isolated unit may establish a support agreement with any Air Force installation
   within a 15-mile radius, regardless of whether other military installations may be closer.
   11.4.2. An isolated unit may establish an agreement for MWR support with only one
   military installation at a time.
   11.4.3. Include intra-command support in the support agreement.
         11.4.3.1. The MAJCOM/SVF negotiates such agreements and gets approval from the
         host-tenant MAJCOM. The MAJCOM/SVF approves a memorandum of understanding
         (MOU), including the intra-command support provided.
         11.4.3.2. The isolated unit fund (IUF) custodian keeps a copy of the MOU in the Life-of-
         the-Fund file.
   11.4.4. Isolated units are not necessarily entitled to host base MWR funds for unit parties
   and picnics.
         11.4.4.1. Installations may choose to provide such support (see paragraph 4.3.4).
         11.4.4.2. Don't use any NAF source to provide supplemental funding for unit parties and
         picnics when local installation MWR programs do not include such support.
   11.4.5. HQ AFSVA provides funding annually for Defense Attache Offices based on
   estimated military strength and adjusted to actual expenses at the end of the fiscal year.
   11.4.6. Establish an isolated unit as an isolated unit fund when the unit's revenues exceed, or
   are expected to exceed, $36,500 per year. The isolated unit fund is subject to all regulations,
   reporting, and other requirements of MWR funds.
11.5. Determining MWR Support for Isolated Units.
   11.5.1. Isolated Unit Report (RCS: HAF-SV [A&Q] 9469). Annually, by 1 October
   (with data as of 1 August), each MAJCOM/SV sends HQ AFSVA/SVF a listing of its
   isolated units. This report is designated emergency status code C3. Continue reporting
   during emergency conditions, delayed precedence. Submit data requirements as prescribed,
   but they may be delayed to allow the submission of higher precedence reports. During
   emergency conditions, submit by nonelectronic means, if possible. Discontinue reporting
   during MINIMIZE. This report includes:
   - The unit name and location.
      - Military strength by branch of service.
      - Name and distance from closest military installation.
      - Location Personal Accounting Symbol (PAS) code.
AFI34-201_USAFASUP_I 7 MAY 2010                                                              51


   - Any additional MWR support a unit receives.
      11.5.1.1. Units with more than 100 military personnel provide this report by the first day
      of each quarter with data as of 2 months prior.
   11.5.2. HQ AFSVA/SVF provides funding to each MAJCOM, for support of its isolated
   units annually or quarterly (as reported in paragraph 11.5.1), at a per capita rate that HQ
   USAF/SV establishes.
      11.5.2.1. To determine the equivalent full-time strength of ANG and Reserve units,
      multiply their authorized strength by 5 percent and apply the per capita funding formula
      to the result.
11.6. Accounting for MWR Disbursements to Isolated Units.
   11.6.1. The MAJCOM accounts for MAJCOM or base (if the MAJCOM assigns support
   responsibility to a base) disbursements to isolated units. Accounting is in accordance with
   AFI 34-209.
   11.6.2. The allocating NAFI transfers NAFs for ANG units to the United States Property and
   Fiscal Officer (USPFO) for the state involved. Allocated NAFs remain assets of the
   allocating NAFI until they are actually expended.
      11.6.2.1. The USPFO establishes a single bank account (checking or savings) for these
      NAFs.
   11.6.3. Do not commingle NAFs with any other type of funds (state, Federal, private, or
   other).
      11.6.3.1. If more than one NAFI allocates funds (for example, if the state has ANG units
      supported by more than one MAJCOM or base), the NAFs that the USPFO receives may
      be commingled, but they must be accounted for in such a way that allocations from a
      supporting NAFI are used for ANG units entitled to support from that NAFI.
      11.6.3.2. The USPFO disburses NAFs to support ANG units as needed. Use of these
      NAFs is according to the provisions of this AFI.
11.7. Disbursing Funds to Isolated Units.
   11.7.1. MAJCOMs provide support to their units at intervals that the MAJCOM establishes.
   11.7.2. A MAJCOM/SV may designate a base MWR fund within the command to provide
   MWR fund support to an isolated unit.
   11.7.3. An isolated unit fund may act as a consolidated NAFI to account for the funds of
   other isolated units that the same MAJCOM or base MWR fund supports. The fund may
   include other MAJCOM or other military service units by agreement.
   11.7.4. A MAJCOM/SV may provide MWR funds to the parent organization to use for a
   group of isolated units or detachments.
   11.7.5. If funds provided to a MAJCOM for a unit are not disbursed to the unit, the
   MAJCOM returns the funds to the AFMWRF.
      11.7.5.1. Annually, each MAJCOM reports funds disbursed to their units.

     11.7.5.2. HQ AFSVA determines the amount, if any, the MAJCOM must return to the
     AFMWRF.
  11.7.6. Provide additional MWR funds to isolated units from command funds, if the parent
  command thinks it necessary.

              SUPPORT FOR SPECIAL MORALE AND WELFARE (SM

12.1. SM&W Expenditures.
   12.1.1. SM&W expenditures are NAF expenditures considered necessary to contribute to the
   overall morale and welfare of the military community. SM&W expenditures must:
      12.1.1.1. Be conservative.
      12.1.1.2. Be in the best interests of the Air Force.
      12.1.1.3. Benefit the military community.
      12.1.1.4. Not be limited to specific grades or levels of personnel.
   12.1.2. Don't use SM&W funds in lieu of APFs for purposes authorized in AFI 65-603,
   Official Representation Funds, unless specifically authorized in this chapter.
12.2. Commander Responsibilities.
   12.2.1. Commanders may approve expenditures of NAFs from the applicable MWRF for
   SM&W purposes according to this chapter.
      12.2.1.1. Obtain advance approval prior to all SM&W expenditures. Commanders
      establish procedures to ensure that all SM&W expenditures are approved in advance.
      12.2.1.2. Commanders may delegate expenditure approval authority up to specific
      amounts for recurring functions such as civic affairs, conferences, recognition programs,
      and occasions that orient members of the command.
      12.2.1.3. MAJCOM, FOA, and Numbered Air Force commanders may delegate approval
      authority to the director of staff-level for all other expenditures.
      12.2.1.4. Commanders below these levels may not delegate approval authority.
      12.2.1.5. Persons who are delegated authority to approve purchases must comply with
      AFI 64-301, where NAF purchases are involved.
      12.2.1.6. Commanders may establish a petty cash fund to expedite small item
      purchasing.
   12.2.2. MAJCOM commanders ensure the program's integrity by personally monitoring
   base-level expenditures and requiring and reviewing quarterly reports of base-level SM&W
   expenditures. They or their delegates (see paragraph 12.2.1) approve or disapprove SM&W
   expenditures from the MAJCOM MWR fund.
      12.2.2.1. Subordinate commanders and commanders of units that other MAJCOMs
      support submit a quarterly report of all SM&W expenditures to their supporting
      MAJCOM commander. Use Expenditures for SM&W Purposes, RCS: HAF-
      MWR(Q)8401. This report is designated emergency status code C3. Continue reporting
      during emergency conditions, delayed precedence. Submit data requirements as
      prescribed, but they may be delayed to allow the submission of higher precedence
      reports. Submit by nonelectronic means, if possible. Discontinue reporting during

     MINIMIZE. Itemize each expenditure, the dollar amount, purpose, items or services
     purchased, and recipients. Include command-level expenditures in quarterly reports.
     12.2.2.2. A HQ AFSVA representative periodically visits MAJCOMs to evaluate their
     management of the SM&W program. This representative provides a written report of
     findings to the MAJCOM/SV for resolution with the command section.
     12.2.2.3. MAJCOMs must respond to the finding in writing, indicating what corrective
     actions they're taking.
  12.2.3. Host commanders have an obligation to fulfill the SM&W requirements for their unit
  commanders, tenant unit commanders on their bases, and off-base unit commanders for
  which they have MWRF support responsibility. Requests for SM&W funds follow the format
  at Attachment 6.
 12.2.4. The commander decides what SM&W needs will be met and closely scrutinizes each
 expenditure to avoid criticism or embarrassment to the Air Force. Initially forward all
 requests for SM&W expenditures to FM for funding from APFs (see AFI 65-603, Official
 Representation Funds):
     12.2.4.1. If FM certifies that representation funds are not authorized, you may submit a
     request to use NAFs for an authorized SM&W expenditure.
     12.2.4.2. If APF representation funds are authorized but not available, don't use NAFs
     for the SM&W expenditures.
     12.2.4.3. (Added-USAFA) Each AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, submitted to NAF
     Accounting (10 FSS/FSR) must be accompanied by a memo annotated with the
     authorized expense category described in AFI 34-201 or AFI 65-603 Official
     Representation Funds-Guidance And Procedures, Contingency Funds; Miscellaneous
     Current Expenses; Official Representation Funds; PEC 91515F. When the Falcon Club
     is used, the pertinent expense category memo will accompany the copy of the party sheet
     sent to 10 FSS/FSR. When items are purchased from the Academy Gift Shop, the
     expense category memo will accompany the payable voucher to 10 FSS/FSR. SM&W
     expense categories and cost center codes are as follows:
         12.2.4.3.1. (Added-USAFA) Individual Recognition (Q1)

   required to ensure their effectiveness. The authorization for SM&W expenditures does not
   constitute a commander's fund in any sense.
12.3. MWR Fund Custodian Responsibilities.
   12.3.1. The custodian:
       12.3.1.1. Briefs incoming commanders who exercise SM&W expenditure authority on
       the provisions in this chapter.

   items and ensures that mementos are not purchased for resale.
   12.3.3. The custodian establishes sound stock control procedures.
       12.3.3.1. Ensure that the inventory system provides a clear audit trail for items purchased
       and records the specific purposes and events for which the items were issued. (You may
       control mementos manually using stock record or bin cards or computerize these
       records.)
          12.3.3.1.1. (Added-USAFA) Items routinely maintained in the ―  perpetual inventory
          closet‖ must be approved, purchased, and restocked as required. In addition to the
          purchase records, a memorandum listing the quantity of items, appropriately
          approved, will be maintained by the NAF Resource Management Flight.
       12.3.3.2. Conduct an annual inventory and provide an inventory report to the
       commander. Make sure that independent persons conduct the inventory, with help from
       the memento custodian. The MWR fund custodian keeps all inventory certifications for
       audit purposes.
       12.3.3.3. Don't mix inventory items purchased from SM&W funds with items purchased
       from appropriated contingency (official representation) or other funds.

          12.3.3.4.1. (Added-USAFA) Actual versus budgeted expenditures will be tracked
          and analyses provided by 10 FSS/FSR as prescribed for NAFs. Corrective actions,
          when required, will be taken by the appropriate offices to ensure prudent use of NAF
          dollars and to ensure sufficient funds are available to cover expenses.
12.4. Permissible Expenditures. Commanders and others delegated approval authority will not
expend funds for SM&W purposes if funds are authorized elsewhere in this instruction or
authorized from APFs (AFI 65-603), unless this paragraph cites them as an exception. This
