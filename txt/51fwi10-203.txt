1. General:
     1.1. The purpose of this instruction is to ensure aircraft shelters are available for reception
     and beddown of forces deploying to Osan Air Base during peacetime or contingency
     operations IAW the Osan Base Support Plan (BSP) II located at \\osfs1-s\TBMCSUL\BSP.
     This will be accomplished by peacetime shelter users who are required to clean out their
     facilities when directed. For the purposes of this publication, “shelter” encompasses HASs,
     revetments, hangars and unprotected parking spaces within the A-Diamond, B-Diamond, C-
     Diamond, and Draggin’s Lair, as indicated in Attachment 4.
     1.2. The following instructions do not transfer or negate the responsibility of designated
     facility managers to monitor or maintain facilities IAW 51 FWI 32-1001, Facility Manager’s
     Guide. Facility managers will continue all normal responsibilities despite approved storage
     requests within a shelter.
     1.3. The 51 FW/CC will initiate the shelter cleanout upon notification of inbound deployed
     forces or when otherwise deemed necessary. The initiation will disseminate through the 51
     OG Mission Coordinator or through the 51 OSS/DO.
     1.4. These procedures are executed and monitored by the 51 OSS/DO during peacetime
     operations and the 51 OG Mission Coordinator during contingency operations. Any
     associated reporting will flow through the same channels.
     1.5. 51 MXG units are allocated specific parking spaces designated in BSP II, Chapter 8.
     The scope of cleanout responsibility for those parking spaces extends only to the ability of 51
     MXG units to consolidate all aircraft and equipment within those spaces. No additional
     procedures are required unless 51 MXG aircraft or equipment extends beyond the designated
     parking spaces. If additional space is required, the procedures within this instruction
     delineate the process for acquiring space and executing a cleanout.
     1.6. Aircraft shelters without facility managers (revetments/unprotected parking) and those
     that lie outside of the 51 MXG designated spaces require 51 OSS/DO approval prior to use
     by utilizing the procedures within this instruction.
     1.7. Agencies requesting utilization of 51 MXG designated parking spaces require approval
     from 51 MXG/CD prior to use by utilizing the procedures within this instruction.
2. 51st Operations Group Responsiblities:

      Coordinator.
      2.3.2. Assist 51 OG Combat Catch in shelter inspections if directed by 51 OSS/DO or 51
      OG Mission Coordinator.
      2.3.3. After cleanout, ensure airfield is ready for reception IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft
      Operations and Movement on the Ground.
      2.3.4. Report airfield discrepancies to 51 OSS/DO or 51 OG Mission Coordinator.
3. Facility Manager Responsibilities:
   3.1. Facility managers maintaining responsibility of shelters indicated in Attachment 4 will:
      3.1.1. Monitor and maintain facilities IAW 51 FWI 32-1001, despite any approved
      Shelter Storage Request (Attachment 2).
      3.1.2. Ensure the shelter remains clear and ready for aircraft reception at all times. If a
      shelter is designated a parking spot for 51 MXG within BSP II, Chapter 8, 51 MXG may
      use the shelter as desired, provided all 51 MXG aircraft reside within the designated
      spots.
      3.1.3. If an agency requests the storage of equipment within a shelter, direct the using
      agency to 51 MOF/MXOP and this instruction for initiation of a Shelter Storage Request
      (Attachment 2) and Shelter Cleanout Plan (Attachment 3).
      3.1.4. If a storage request is approved, maintain a copy of the approved Shelter Storage
      Request (Attachment 2) and Shelter Cleanout Plan (Attachment 3).
      3.1.5. Assist 51 MOF/MXOP in ensuring users re-submit/update Shelter Storage
      Requests (Attachment 2) and Shelter Clean out Plans (Attachment 3) semi-annually, NLT
      31 January and 31 July.
      3.1.6. If required, provide a Signed AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt,
      http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a4_7/form/af1297/af1297.xfd , to 51
 4                                                                  51FWI10-203 18 JULY 2014


        MOF/MXOP, transferring responsibility of permanently assigned shelter equipment to
        the using agency.
        3.1.7. Maintain current contact information for shelter users. If contact information
        changes, immediately notify 51 MOF/MXOP.
4. 51st Maintenance Operations Flight Responsibilities:
     4.1. The following responsibilities are strictly for developing a central point for all Shelter
     Storage Requests. No shelter responsibilities are transferred to 51 MOF from facility
     managers or owning agencies. For example: Building 1187 is currently owned by the 51
     OSS. If an outside agency desires storage within 1187, the storage request will flow through
     51 MOF for approval by the 51 OSS/DO (reference paragraph 1.6). Once approved, the
     storage request and associated documents will be stored by 51 MOF for central
     accountability purposes. The 51 OSS facility manager still maintains all responsibility in
     regard to building 1187, including maintaining a copy of the storage request information.
     However, 51 MOF will serve as a central agency maintaining situational awareness on
     required resources to execute a shelter cleanout of the shelters designated in Attachment 4.
     4.2. 51 MOF/MXOP maintains accountability (not responsibility) for the use of the A-
     Diamond, B- Diamond, C-Diamond, and Draggin’s Lair as designated in Attachment 4. If a
     shelter designated in Attachment 4 is outside the scope of 51 MXG facility managers,
     accountability in this sense is merely a record keeping function. The purpose of maintaining
     a central record keeping function is to ensure all facility managers and associated agencies
     utilizing shelters for storage are easily contacted for cleanout execution by a single agency.
     4.3. 51 MOF/MXOP will:
        4.3.1. Acquire Shelter Storage Request approval from 51 MXG/CD for 51 MXG
        designated parking locations or from 51 OSS/DO for all other shelters (including
        revetments and open parking spaces). Only the spots designated in Attachment 4 require
        approval.
        4.3.2. Maintain a current list of users in each shelter identified in Attachment 4. If a
        facility isn’t being used or there is no active storage, no documentation is necessary (with
        the exception of maintaining awareness that the shelter isn’t occupied).
        4.3.3. Store, file, and maintain the following documentation for each occupied shelter:
            4.3.3.1. Current Shelter Storage Request (Attachment 2), produced by the shelter
            user.
            4.3.3.2. Current Shelter Cleanout Plan (Attachment 3), not to exceed 24 hours for
            execution, produced by the shelter user.
            4.3.3.3. If required, provide a signed AF Form 129, transferring responsibility of
            permanently assigned shelter equipment from the facility manager to the shelter user,
            produced by the facility manager.
        4.3.4. Provide a copy of the User’s Shelter Cleanout Plan to 51 MXG Emergency
        Support Function (ESF) representative when requested.
51FWI10-203 18 JULY 2014                                                                     5


       4.3.5. Advise users in the coordination and processing of work orders with 51
       CES/CEOER Customer Service Operations (CSO). This function is merely directing
       users to CSO or the owning agency facility manager when work orders are required.
       4.3.6. Ensure users re-submit/update Shelter Storage Requests (Attachment 2) and
       Shelter Clean out Plans (Attachment 3) semi-annually, NLT 31 January and 31 July.
       4.3.7. Maintain a consolidated list of required personnel, equipment, and support
       elements to complete the entire shelter cleanout. This encompasses all shelters which
       have approved Shelter Storage Requests designated in Attachment 4.
       4.3.8. Upon direction from the 51 OSS/DO or 51 OG Mission Coordinator, notify shelter
       users to execute the shelter cleanout as indicated in the stored Shelter Cleanout Plan
       (Attachment 3). Utilize the owning agency facility manager as required.
5. Shelter User Responsibilities:
   5.1. Requests for use will be submitted to 51 MOF/MXOP by using Attachment 2 (Shelter
   Storage Request). All fields will be completed or request will be denied.
   5.2. Using agency will provide the following to 51 MOF/MXOP prior to occupation:
       5.2.1. Copy of training verification for all personnel authorized to operate HAS
       doors, as applicable. Contact 51 MOS/MXOT to schedule HAS Door Training.
       5.2.2. A shelter cleanout plan by using Attachment 3.
       5.2.3. A copy of the using agency door access key or lock combination.
       5.2.4. Signed AF Form 1297, which transfers responsibility of the permanently
       assigned shelter equipment (Note: Permanent HAS equipment will not be removed or
       disassembled. HAS door motor key will not be removed from the facility).
   5.3. Users will:
       5.3.1. Revalidate shelter use requests with 51 MOF/MXOP and owning agency facility
       manger semi-annually or whenever changes occur. Revalidation will be completed NLT
       31 January and 31 July.
       5.3.2. Perform and document periodic facility inspections IAW 51 FWI 32-1001,
       Attachments 3, 4, 6 & 7. Maintain inspection results and immediately report any
       discrepancies that impact ability to use shelter(s) for either peacetime or
       contingency operations to 51 MOF/MXOP and owning agency facility manager.
       5.3.3. Coordinate all CE work requests through the building facility managers identified
       in the Shelter Storage Request (Attachment 2) except for emergency repair calls.
       Emergency repair calls will be called in directly to CE CSO. At the next earliest
       opportunity, information on emergency calls will be provided to 51 MOF/MXOP and
       owning agency facility manager.

        5.3.5. If contact information changes, immediately notify 51 MOF/MXOP and owning
        agency facility manager.
     5.4. If shelter users are comprised of deployed forces IAW BSP II Chapter 8, all
     requirements within this publication apply with the exception of User Storage Requests and
     User Shelter Cleanout Plans.
6. Shelter Vacating Procedures:
     6.1. 51 OSS/DO or 51 OG Mission Coordinator will initiate execution of the shelter cleanout
     plan with 51 MOF/MXOP when directed by the 51 FW/CC.
     6.2. A list of resources required for cleanout will be consolidated by 51 MOF/MXOP and
     briefed to the 51 OSS/DO or 51 OG Mission Coordinator. Allocation of resources
     will be prioritized by the 51 OSS/DO or 51 OG Mission Coordinator if required.
     6.3. 51 MOF/MXOP will expeditiously notify users to vacate assigned shelters IAW the
     submitted Shelter Cleanout Plan (Attachment 3). Any user unable to comply with the
     actions presented in the Shelter Cleanout Plan will be relayed to the 51 OSS/DO or 51 OG
     Mission Coordinator.
     6.4. Users will provide updates every 3 hours to their squadron Unit Control Center (UCC)
