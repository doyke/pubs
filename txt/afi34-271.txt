Section A—Program Overview

1. Purpose and Background. Marksmanship is an inherent military skill, which sets shooting
apart from other Services activities. The Competitive Shooting Program motivates participants
to improve their shooting skill in hopes of being selected for the Air Force Shooting Teams. The
Shooting Program is limited to Active Duty, Air National Guard, or Air Reserve personnel.
Participants can ultimately, gain a position on the Olympic, Pan American, Conseil International
du Sport Militaire (CISM), or other teams representing the United States in international
competition. The Competitive Shooting Program:
     1.1. Leads to international competition and supports Department of Defense (DoD) Directive
     1330.4. Participation in Armed Forces, National, and International Sports Activities, 9
     March 1987.
     1.2. Includes participation in Interservice and National sports.
     1.3. Is eligible for appropriated fund support through Olympic training funds.
     1.4. Advances marksmanship by a formal program similar to those conducted by the other
     services, Reserve Forces and the National Guard (NG).
        1.4.1. The Chief, National Guard Bureau (CNGB) exercises control over small arms
        competitive marksmanship activities for the NG.
            1.4.1.1. The CNGB approves interservice, national, and international level
            competitions in which NG personnel may compete; supports the participation of NG
            personnel selected to represent the NG and United States in approved interservice,
            national, and international marksmanship competitions; and supervises the
            expenditure of funds for support of NG personnel in national, interservice, and
            international competitions.
                1.4.1.1.1. The Commander, National Guard Marksmanship Training Center
                (NGMTC) conducts competitive marksmanship clinics as directed by CNGB;
                maintains records of NG personnel competing in Excellence-in-Competition
                (EIC) matches; conducts and supervises annual Armed Forces Skill-at-Arms
                Meeting; conducts and supervises annual Interservice Sniper Sustainment
                Exercise; supervises Marksmanship Advisory Council’s Regional Marksmanship
                Proficiency Training Exercises; selects, supports and supervises personnel to
                represent NG in Armed Forces interservice, national, and international level
                competitions; and notifies CNGB of NG personnel selected to represent the
                United States in approved international sporting level competitions.
     1.5. Augments Air Force recruiting efforts by conducting shooting clinics at universities,
     high schools, and local clubs.
2. Equipping Team Members. Individuals traditionally provide their own equipment,
ammunition, and weapons. The Air Force provides a reasonable amount of ammunition for
training and competition, entry fees, travel, and personal maintenance expense allowance, or per
AFI34-271 21 JANUARY 2011                                                                      3


diem (if available), as well as funding for miscellaneous expenses to include the availability of
gunsmith support.
3. Shooting Discipline Composition. The number of shooting discipline (teams) team
members may vary each year depending on availability and demonstrated performance of
applicants and projected funding levels. The teams are comprised of a primary and a
developmental team. Each shooting discipline is restricted to a maximum membership of ten
members, primary and developmental combined. Deployed team members may be placed in
inactive (unfunded) status and not count against the total team composition during deployment.
The overall shooting program is made up of the following nine distinct and separate teams.

equipment, or cash. Air Force personnel who are off-duty, not on official or permissive TDY,
and who entirely pay their own expenses are exempt from this rule. HQ AFSVA/SVPCR,
through coordination with HQ AFSVA/SVL, makes the final determination concerning whether
or not awards are acceptable.
13. After-Match and Cumulative Cost Summary. These are informal summaries that team
captains submit. They include the names and scores of first, second, and third place finishers in
each major event and the scores and relative standing of all Air Force competitors. The reports
also include recommendations and a summary of total travel, personal maintenance expense
allowance or per diem (if available), entry fees, and miscellaneous expenses. Individuals who
participate in competitions must submit after-match data to the team captain.
14. Shooting Program Ammunition. If budget permits, a limited amount of ammunition will
be provided by HQ AFSVA/SVPCR to team members on an annual basis. Team members must
coordinate with their respective installation MASO for use and disposition of government
ammunition. Ammunition residue is not turned in due to safety requirements during
competitions prohibiting the pickup of brass. Minor quantities of match brass recovered is
reloaded by team members and reused. Orders on DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization
for TDY Travel of DOD Personnel, or AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization, must include
the following statement: "IAW Federal Firearms Act, 18 U.S.C. 925, individuals are authorized
to transport firearms and ammunition during the period of official TDY.”
