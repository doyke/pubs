Section 1Aâ€”Introduction

1.1. Navigation Publications. Aviators use air navigation to determine where they're going and how to
get there. This pamphlet serves as a reference for techniques and methods used in air navigation.

1.1.1. In addition to this pamphlet, several other sources provide excellent references to methods and
techniques of navigation. These sources include:

1.1.1.1. Journal of The Institute of Navigation. This journal is published quarterly by The Institute of
Navigation, 1800 Diagonal Road, Alexandria VA 22314, and covers the latest in navigation technology.

1.1.1.2. These United States Observatory and US Navy Oceanographic Office publications:

1.1.1.2.1. Air Almanac.

1.1.1.2.2. Nautical Almanac.

1.1.1.2.3. NV Pub 9 (Volumes 1 and 2), The American Practical Navigator.

1.1.1.2.4. SR Pub 249, Volumes 1 through 3, Sight Reduction Tables for Air Navigation.

1.1.1.3. Catalog, NIMA Public Sale Aeronautical Charts and Products, published by the National
Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA).

1.2. Basic Terms. Basic to the study of navigation is an understanding of certain terms which could be
called the dimensions of navigation. The navigator uses these dimensions of position, direction, distance,
altitude, and time as basic references. A clear understanding of these dimensions as they relate to
navigation is necessary to provide the navigator with a means of expressing and accomplishing the
practical aspects of air navigation. These terms are defined as follows:

1.2.1. Position. A point defined by stated or implied coordinates. Though frequently qualified by such
adjectives as estimated, dead reckoning (DR), no wind, and so forth, the word position always refers to
some place that can be identified. It is obvious that a navigator must know the aircraft's current position
before being able to direct the aircraft to another position or in another direction.

1.2.2. Direction. The position of one point in space relative to another without reference to the distance
between them. Direction is not in itself an angle, but it is often measured in terms of its angular distance
from a referenced direction.

1.2.3. Distance. The spatial separation between two points, measured by the length of a line joining
them. On a plane surface, this is a simple problem. However, consider distance on a sphere, where the
separation between points may be expressed as a variety of curves. It is essential that the navigator
20                                                                  AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

decide exactly how the distance is to be measured. The length of the line can be expressed in various
units; for example, nautical miles (NM) or yards.

1.2.4. Altitude. The height of an aircraft above a reference plane. Altitude can be measured as absolute
or pressure. Absolute altitude is measured by a radar altimeter, and pressure altitude is measured from
various datum planes. Compare with elevation, which is the height of a point or feature on the earth
above a reference plane.

1.2.5. Time. Defined in many ways, but definitions used in navigation consist mainly of: (l) the hour of
the day and (2) an elapsed interval.

1.2.6. Methods of Expression. The methods of expressing position, direction, distance, altitude, and
time are covered fully in appropriate chapters. These terms, and others similar to them, represent definite
quantities or conditions which may be measured in several different ways. For example, the position of
an aircraft may be expressed in coordinates such as a certain latitude and longitude. The position may
also be expressed as 10 miles south of a certain city. The study of navigation demands the navigator
learn how to measure quantities such as those just defined and how to apply the units by which they are
expressed.

Section 1Bâ€”The Earth

1.3. Shape and Size. For most navigational purposes, the earth is assumed to be a perfect sphere,
although in reality it is not. Inspection of the earth's crust reveals there is a height variation of
approximately 12 miles from the top of the tallest mountain to the bottom of the deepest point in the
ocean. A more significant deviation from "round" is caused by a combination of the earth's rotation and
its structural flexibility. When you take the ellipsoidal shape of the planet into account, mountains seem
rather insignificant. The peaks of the Andes are much farther from the center of the earth than Mount
Everest.

1.3.1. Measured at the equator, the earth is approximately 6,378,137 meters in diameter, while the polar
diameter is approximately 6,356,752.3142 meters. The difference in these diameters is 21,384.6858
meters, and this difference may be used to express the ellipticity of the earth. The ratio between this
difference and the equatorial diameter is:




1.3.2. Since the equatorial diameter exceeds the polar diameter by only 1 part in 298, the earth is nearly
spherical. A symmetrical body having the same dimensions as the earth, but with a smooth surface, is
called an ellipsoid. The ellipsoid is sometimes described as a spheroid, or an oblate spheroid.

1.3.3. In Figure 1.1, Pn, E, Ps, and W represent the surface of the earth, and Pn-Ps represents the axis of
rotation. The earth rotates from W to E. All points in the hemisphere Pn, W, Ps approach the reader,
while those in the opposite hemisphere recede from the reader. The circumference W-E is called the
equator, which is defined as that imaginary circle on the surface of the earth whose plane passes through
the center of the earth and is perpendicular to the axis of rotation.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                         21

1.4. Great Circles and Small Circles. A great circle is defined as a circle on the surface of a sphere
whose center and radius are those of the sphere itself. It is the largest circle that can be drawn on the
sphere; it is the intersection with the surface of the earth of any plane passing through the earth's center.

1.4.1. The arc of a great circle is the shortest distance between two points on a sphere, just as a straight
line is the shortest distance between two points on a plane. On any sphere, an indefinitely large number
of great circles may be drawn through any point, though only one great circle may be drawn through any
two points not diametrically opposite. Several great circles are shown in Figure 1.2.

1.4.2. Circles on the surface of the sphere other than great circles may be defined as small circles. A
small circle is a circle on the surface of the earth whose center and/or radius are not that of the sphere. A
set of small circles, called latitude, is discussed later.

1.4.3. In summary, the intersection of a sphere and a plane is a great circle if the plane passes through the
center of the sphere and a small circle if it does not.

1.5. Latitude and Longitude. The nature of a sphere is such that any point on it is exactly like any other
point. There is neither beginning nor ending as far as differentiation of points is concerned. In order that
points may be located on the earth, some points or lines of reference are necessary so that other points
may be located with regard to them. The location of New York City with reference to Washington DC
can be stated as a number of miles in a certain direction from Washington. Any point on the earth can be
located in this manner.

1.5.1. Imaginary Reference Lines. Such a system, however, does not lend itself readily to navigation,
because it would be difficult to locate a point precisely in midocean without any nearby geographic
22                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

features to use for reference. We use a system of coordinates to locate positions on the earth by means of
imaginary reference lines. These lines are known as parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude.


Figure 1.2. A Great Circle Is the Largest Circle in a Sphere.




1.5.2. Latitude. Once a day, the earth rotates on its north-south axis which is terminated by the two
poles. The equatorial plane is constructed at the midpoint of this axis at right angles to it (Figure 1.3). A
great circle drawn through the poles is called a meridian, and an infinite number of great circles may be
constructed in this manner. Each meridian is divided into four quadrants by the equator and the poles.
The circle is arbitrarily divided into 360o, and each of these quadrants contains 90o.

1.5.2.1. Take a point on one of these meridians 30o N of the equator. Through this point passes a plane
perpendicular to the north-south axis of rotation. This plane will be parallel to the plane of the equator as
shown in Figure 1.3 and will intersect the earth in a small circle called a parallel or parallel of latitude.
The particular parallel of latitude chosen as 30o N and every point on this parallel will be at 30o N. In the
same way, other parallels can be constructed at any desired latitude, such as 10o, 40o, etc.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       23

Figure 1.3. Planes of the Earth.




1.5.2.2. Bear in mind that the equator is drawn as the great circle midway between the poles and parallels
of latitude are small circles constructed with reference to the equator. The angular distance measured on
a meridian north or south of the equator is known as latitude (Figure 1.4) and forms one component of
the coordinate system.


Figure 1.4. Latitude as an Angular Measurement.




1.5.3. Longitude. The latitude of a point can be shown as 20o N or 20o S of the equator, but there is no
way of knowing whether one point is east or west of another. This difficulty is resolved by use of the
other component of the coordinate system, longitude, which is the measurement of this east-west
distance. Longitude, unlike latitude, has no natural starting point for numbering. The solution has been to
select an arbitrary starting point. A great many places have been used, but when the English-speaking
24                                                                AFPAM11-216         1 MARCH 2001

people began to make charts, they chose the meridian through their principal observatory in Greenwich,
England, as the origin for counting longitude. This Greenwich meridian is sometimes called the prime
meridian, though actually it is the zero meridian. Longitude is counted east and west from this meridian
through 180o, as shown in Figure 1.5. Thus, the Greenwich meridian is the 0o longitude on one side of
the earth and, after crossing the poles, it becomes the 180th meridian (180o east or west of the 0o
meridian).

Figure 1.5. Longitude Is Measured East and West of Greenwich Meridian.




1.5.4. Summary. In summary, if a globe has the circles of latitude and longitude drawn upon it
according to the principles described, any point can be located on the globe using these measurements
(Figure 1.6).

Figure 1.6. Latitude Is Measured From the Equator; Longitude From the Prime Meridian.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        25

1.5.4.1. It is beneficial to point out here some of the measurements used in the coordinate system.
Latitude is measured in degrees up to 90, and longitude is expressed in degrees up to 180. The total
number of degrees in any one circle is always 360. A degree (o) of arc may be subdivided into smaller
units by dividing each degree into 60 minutes (') of arc. Each minute may be further subdivided into 60
seconds (") of arc. Measurement may also be expressed in degrees, minutes, and tenths of minutes.

1.5.4.2. A position on the surface of the earth is expressed in terms of latitude and longitude. Latitude is
expressed as being either north or south of the equator, and longitude as either east or west of the prime
meridian.

1.5.4.3. In actual practice, map production requires surveyors to measure the latitude and longitude of
geographic objects in their area of interest. Local variation in the earth's gravity field can cause these
measurements to be inconsistent. All coordinates from maps, charts, traditional surveys, and satellite
positioning systems are thus tied to an individual mathematical model of the earth called a datum.
Coordinates for a given point may differ between datums by hundreds of yards. In other words, latitude
and longitude measured directly from observation of stars (called an astronomic coordinate) will be
consistent, but it may not match maps, charts, or surveyed points. The theoretical consistency of latitude
and longitude is therefore not achievable in reality. Without knowledge of the datum used to establish a
particular map or surveyed coordinate, the coordinate is suspect at best.

1.6. Distance. Distance, as previously defined, is measured by the length of a line joining two points.
The standard unit of distance for navigation is the nautical mile (NM). The nautical mile can be defined
as either 6,076 feet or 1 minute of latitude.

1.6.1. Sometimes it is necessary to convert statute miles to nautical miles and vice versa. This
conversion is easily done with the following ratio:




1.6.2. Closely related to the concept of distance is speed, which determines the rate of change of
position. Speed is usually expressed in miles per hour, this being either statute miles per hour or NM per
hour. If the measure of distance is NM, it is customary to speak of speed in terms of knots. Thus, a speed
of 200 knots and a speed of 200 NM per hour are the same thing. It is incorrect to say 200 knots per hour
unless referring to acceleration.

1.7. Direction. Remember, direction is the position of one point in space relative to another without
reference to the distance between them. The time-honored point system for specifying a direction as
north, north-northwest, northwest, west-northwest, west, etc., is not adequate for modern navigation. It
has been replaced for most purposes by a numerical system. The numerical system (Figure 1.7) divides
the horizon into 360o, starting with north as 000o and continuing clockwise through east 090o, south
180o, west 270o, and back to north.

1.7.1. The circle, called a compass rose, represents the horizon divided into 360o. The nearly vertical
lines in the illustration are meridians drawn as straight lines with the meridian of position A passing
through 000o and 180o of the compass rose. Position B lies at a true direction of 062o from A, and
position C is at a true direction of 220o from A.
26                                                                 AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

Figure 1.7. Numerical System Is Used in Air Navigation.




1.7.2. Since determination of direction is one of the most important parts of the navigator's work, the
various terms involved should be clearly understood. Generally, in navigation, unless otherwise stated,
directions are called true directions.

1.7.3. Course is the intended horizontal direction of travel. Heading is the horizontal direction in which
an aircraft is pointed. Heading is the actual orientation of the longitudinal axis of the aircraft at any
instant, while course is the direction intended to be made good. Track is the actual horizontal direction
made by the aircraft over the earth.

AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                         27

1.7.4. Bearing is the horizontal direction of one terrestrial point from another. As illustrated in Figure
1.8, the direction of the island from the aircraft is marked by a visual bearing called the line of sight
(LOS). Bearings are usually expressed in terms of one of two reference directions: (1) true north (TN) or
(2) the direction in which the aircraft is pointed. If TN is the reference direction, the bearing is called a
true bearing (TB). If the reference direction is the heading of the aircraft, the bearing is called a relative
bearing (RB) as shown in Figure 1.9.

Figure 1.9. Measuring Relative Bearing From Aircraft Heading.




1.8. Great Circle and Rhumb Line Direction. The direction of the great circle, shown in Figure 1.10,
makes an angle of about 40o with the meridian near Washington, DC , about 85o with the meridian near
Iceland, and a still greater angle with the meridian near Moscow. In other words, the direction of the
great circle is constantly changing as progress is made along the route, and is different at every point
along the great circle. Flying such a route requires constant change of direction and would be difficult to
fly under ordinary conditions. Still, it is the most desirable route because it is the shortest distance
between any two points.

1.8.1. A line that makes the same angle with each meridian is called a rhumb line. An aircraft holding a
constant true heading would be flying a rhumb line. Flying this sort of path results in a greater distance
traveled, but it is easier to steer. If continued, a rhumb line spirals toward the poles in a constant true
direction but never reaches them. The spiral formed is called a loxodrome or loxodromic curve as shown
in Figure 1.11.

Figure 1.11. A Rhumb Line or Loxodrome.




1.8.2. Between two points on the earth, the great circle is shorter than the rhumb line, but the difference
is negligible for short distances (except in high latitudes) or if the line approximates a meridian or the
equator.

Section 1Câ€”Time

1.9. Introduction. In celestial navigation, navigators determine the aircraft's position by observing the
celestial bodies. The apparent position of these bodies changes with time. Therefore, determining the
aircraft's position relies on timing the observation exactly. We measure time by the rotation of the earth
and the resulting apparent motions of the celestial bodies. This chapter considers several different
systems of measurement, each with a special use. Before you learn the various kinds of time, you must
understand transit. Notice in Figure 1.12 that the poles divide the observer's meridian into halves. The
observer's position is in the upper branch. The lower branch is the opposite half. Every day, because of
the earth's rotation, every celestial body transits the upper and lower branches of the observer's meridian.
The first kind of time presented here is solar time.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      29

Figure 1.12. Transit Is Caused by the Earth's Rotation.




1.10. Apparent Solar Time. The sun as you see it in the sky is called the true sun or the apparent sun.
Apparent solar time is based upon the movement of the sun as it crosses the sky. A sundial accurately
indicates apparent solar time. Apparent solar time isn't useful because the apparent length of day varies
throughout the year. A timepiece would have to operate at different speeds to indicate correct apparent
time. However, apparent time accurately indicates upper and lower transit. Upper transit occurs at noon;
apparent time and lower transit at midnight apparent time. Difficulties in using apparent time led to the
introduction of mean time.

1.11. Mean Solar Time. A mean day is an artificial unit of constant length, based on the average of all
apparent solar days over a period of years. Time for a mean day is measured with reference to a fictitious
body, the mean sun, so designed that its hour circle moves westward at a constant rate along the celestial
equator. Time computed using the mean sun is called mean solar time. The coordinates of celestial
bodies in the Air Almanac are tabulated in mean solar time, making it the time of primary interest to
navigators. The difference in length between the apparent day (based upon the true sun) and the mean
day (based upon the mean sun) is never as much as a minute. The differences are cumulative, however,
so that the imaginary mean sun precedes or follows the apparent sun by approximately 15 minutes at
certain times during the year.

1.12. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). GMT is used for most celestial computations. GMT is mean
solar time measured from the lower branch of the Greenwich meridian westward through 360o to the
upper branch of the hour circle passing through the mean sun (Figure 1.13). The mean sun transits the
Greenwich meridian's lower branch at GMT 2400 (0000) each day and the upper branch at GMT 1200.
The meridian at Greenwich is the logical selection for this reference, as it is the origin for the
measurement of Greenwich hour angle (GHA) and the reckoning of longitude. Consequently, celestial
coordinates and other information are tabulated in almanacs with reference to GMT. GMT is also called
Zulu or Z time.
30                                                                  AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

Figure 1.13. Measuring Greenwich Mean Time.




1.13. Local Mean Time (LMT). Just as GMT is mean solar time measured with reference to the
Greenwich meridian, LMT is mean solar time measured with reference to the observer's meridian. LMT
is measured from the lower branch of the observers meridian, westward through 360o, to the upper
branch of the hour circle passing through the mean sun (Figure 1.13). The mean sun transits the lower
branch of the observer's meridian at LMT 0000 (2400) and the upper branch at LMT 1200. For an
observer at the Greenwich meridian, GMT is LMT. Navigators use LMT to compute local sunrise,
sunset, twilight, moonrise, and moonset at various latitudes along a given meridian.

Section 1Dâ€”Relationship of Time and Longitude

1.14. Introduction. The mean sun travels at a constant rate, covering 360o of arc in 24 hours. The mean
sun transits the same meridian twice in 24 hours. The following relationships exists between time and
arc:

      Time                       Arc
      24 hours                   360o
      1 hour                     15o
      4 minutes                  1o
      1 minute                   15'


1.14.1. Local time is the time at one particular meridian. Since the sun cannot transit two meridians
simultaneously, no two meridians have exactly the same local time. The difference in time between two
meridians is the time of the sun's passage from one meridian to the other. This time is proportional to the
angular distance between the two meridians. One hour is equivalent to 15o.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       31

1.14.2. If two meridians are 30o apart, their time differs by 2 hours. The easternmost meridian has a later
local time because the sun has crossed its lower branch first; thus, the day is older there. These
statements hold true whether referring to the apparent sun or the mean sun. Figure 1.14 demonstrates
that the sun crossed the lower branch of the meridian of observer # 1 at 60o east longitude 4 hours before
it crossed the lower branch of the Greenwich meridian (60 divided by 15) and 6 hours before it crossed
the lower branch of the meridian of observer #2 at 30o west longitude (90 divided by 15). Therefore, the
local time at 60o east longitude is later by the respective amounts.


Figure 1.14. Local Time Differences at Different Longitudes.




1.15. Standard Time Zone. The world is divided into 24 zones, each zone being 15o of longitude wide.
Each zone uses the LMT of its central meridian. (A few areas of the world are further divided and use
half hour increments from GMT. Some notable examples include India, Bangladesh, Newfoundland, and
parts of Australia and Thailand.) Since the Greenwich meridian is the central meridian for one of the
zones and each zone is 15o or 1 hour wide, the time in each zone differs from GMT by an integral
number of hours. The zones are designated by numbers from 0 to 12 and -12, each indicating the number
of hours that must be added or subtracted to local zone time (LZT) to obtain GMT. Since the time is
earlier in the zones west of Greenwich, the numbers of these zones are plus; in those zones east of
Greenwich, the numbers are minus (Figure 1.15). Ground forces frequently refer to the zones by letters
of the alphabet, and air forces use one of these letters (Z) for GMT. The zone boundaries have been
modified to conform with geographical boundaries for greater convenience. For example, in case a zone
boundary passed through a city, it would be impractical to use the time of one zone in one part of the city
and the time of the adjacent zone in the other part. In some countries, which overlap two or three zones,
one time is used throughout.

1.16. Date Changes at Midnight. If you travelled west from Greenwich around the world and set your
watch back an hour for each time zone, you would have set your watch back a total of 24 hours on
arriving back at Greenwich and the date would be 1 day behind. Conversely, traveling eastward, the
watch would have been advanced a total of 24 hours, gaining a day.
32                                                                AFPAM11-216         1 MARCH 2001

Figure 1.15. Standard Time Zones.




1.16.1. To keep straight, you must add a day somewhere if going around the world to the west and to
lose a day if going around to the east. The 180o meridian is the international dateline where a day is
gained or lost. The date line follows the meridian except where it detours to avoid eastern Siberia, the
western Aleutian Islands, and several groups of islands in the South Pacific.

Figure 1.16. Zone Date Changes.
AFPAM11-216            1 MARCH 2001                                                                       33

1.16.2. The local civil date changes at 2400 or midnight. Thus, the date changes as the mean sun transits
the lower branch of the meridian. Consider the situation in another way. The hour circle of the mean sun
is divided in half at the poles. On the half away from the sun (the lower branch), it is always midnight
LMT. As the lower branch moves westward (Figure 1.16), it pushes the old date before it and drags the
new date after it. As the lower branch approaches the 180o meridian, the area of the old date decreases
and the area of the new date increases. When the lower branch reaches the date line; that is, when the
mean sun transits the Greenwich meridian, the old date is crowded out and the new date for that instant
prevails in the world. Then, as the lower branch passes the date line, a newer date begins east of the
lower branch and the process starts all over again.

1.16.3. The zone date changes at midnight zone time (ZT) or when the lower branch of the mean sun
transits the central meridian of the zone.

1.17. Time Conversion. Sometimes you must convert LMT time to GMT, or GMT to LMT. The Air
Almanac contains a table for conversion of arc to time at a rate of 15o of arc per hour of time (Figure
1.17). This conversion is only good for LMT to GMT, or GMT to LMT. ZT is influenced by daylight
savings time and geographical boundaries. For example, to convert GMT to LMT at 126o-36'W:

             126o00      =     8 h 24 min 00s
                 36'     =         02 min 24s
             126o36'     =     8 h 26 min 24s

To derive LMT from GMT, subtract the time in the Western Hemisphere and add it in the Eastern
Hemisphere. Do the opposite to convert LMT to GMT.

1.18. Sidereal Time. Solar time is measured with reference to the true sun or the mean sun. Time may
also be measured relative to a fixed point in space. Time measured with reference to the first point of
Aries (Ï’), which is considered stationary although it moves slightly, is sidereal or star time. The first
point of Aries is defined as where the sun crosses the equator northbound on the first day of spring.

1.18.1. The sidereal day begins when the first point of Aries transits the upper branch of the observer's
meridian. Local sidereal time (LST) is the number of hours that the first point of Aries has moved
westward from the observers meridian. Expressed in degrees, it equals the local hour angle (LHA) of
Aries (Figure 1.18). LST at Greenwich is Greenwich sidereal time (GST) which is equivalent to the
GHA of Aries.

1.18.2. GST, or GHA of Aries, specifies the position of the stars with relation to the earth. Thus, a given
star is in the same position relative to the earth at the same sidereal time each day.

1.19. Number of Days in a Year. The earth revolves around the sun in a year. The number of days in
the year equals the number of rotations of the earth during one revolution. The earth rotates eastward
about 366.24 times during its yearly eastward revolution. The total effect of one revolution and 366.24
rotations is that the sun appears to revolve around the earth 365.24 times per year. Therefore, there are
365.24 solar days per year. Since the sidereal day is measured with reference to a fixed point, the length
of the sidereal day is the period of the earth's rotation. Therefore, the number of sidereal days in the year
is equal to the number of rotations per year, 366.24.

1.20. Navigator's Use of Time. Navigators use three different kinds of timeâ€” GMT, LMT, and ZT. All
three are based upon the motions of the fictitious mean sun. The mean sun revolves about the earth at the
average rate of the apparent sun, completing one revolution in 24 hours.

1.20.1. Time is based upon the motion of the sun relative to a given meridian. The time is 2400/0000 at
lower transit and 1200 at upper transit. In GMT, the reference meridian is that of Greenwich; in LMT,
the reference meridian is that of a given place; in ZT, the reference meridian is the standard meridian of
a given zone.

1.20.2. The difference between two times equals the difference of longitude of their reference meridians
expressed in time. GMT differs from ZT by the longitude of the zone's standard meridian; LMT differs
from ZT by the difference of longitude between the zone's standard meridian and the meridian of the
place. In interconverting ZT and GMT, the navigator uses the zone description. The zone difference is
the time difference between its standard meridian and GMT and it has a sign to indicate the correction to
ZT to obtain GMT. The sign is plus (+) for west longitude and minus (-) for east longitude.

Section 1Eâ€”Charts and Projections

1.21. Basic Information. There are several basic terms and ideas relative to charts and projections that
the reader should be familiar with before discussing the various projections used in the creation of
aeronautical charts.

1.21.1. A map or chart is a small scale representation on a plane of the surface of the earth or some
portion of it.

1.21.2. A chart projection is a systematic construction of lines on a plane surface to represent the
parallels of latitude and the meridians of longitude of the earth or a section of the earth.
36                                                                 AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

1.21.3. The chart projection forms the basic structure on which a chart is built and determines the
fundamental characteristics of the finished chart.

1.21.4. There are many difficulties that must be resolved when representing a portion of the surface of a
sphere upon a plane. Two of these are distortion and perspective.

1.21.5. Distortion cannot be entirely avoided, but it can be controlled and systematized to some extent in
the drawing of a chart. If a chart is drawn for a particular purpose, it can be drawn in such a way as to
minimize the type of distortion which is most detrimental to the purpose. Surfaces that can be spread out
in a plane without stretching or tearing, such as a cone or cylinder, are called developable surfaces, and
those like the sphere or spheroid that cannot be formed into a plane without distortion are called
nondevelopable (Figure 1.19).


Figure 1.19. Developable and Nondevelopable Surfaces.




1.21.6. The problem of creating a projection lies in developing a method for transferring the meridians
and parallels to the chart in a manner that will preserve certain desired characteristics as nearly as
possible. The methods of projection are either mathematical or perspective.

1.21.7. The perspective or geometric projection consists of projecting a coordinate system based on the
earth-sphere from a given point directly onto a developable surface. The properties and appearance of the
resultant map will depend upon two factors: the type of developable surface and the position of the point
of projection.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                         37

1.21.8. The mathematical projection is derived analytically to provide certain properties or
characteristics which cannot be arrived at geometrically. Let us now consider some of the choices we
have for selecting projections which best accommodate these properties and characteristics.

1.22. Choice of Projection. The ideal chart projection would portray the features of the earth in their
true relationship to each other; that is, directions would be true and distances would be represented at a
constant scale over the entire chart. This would result in equality of area and true shape throughout the
chart. Such a relationship can only be represented on a globe. On a flat chart, it is impossible to preserve
constant scale and true direction in all directions at all points, nor can both relative size and shape of the
geographic features be accurately portrayed throughout the chart. The characteristics most commonly
desired in a chart projection are conformality, constant scale, great circles as straight lines, rhumb lines
as straight lines, true azimuth, and geographic position easily located.

1.22.1. Conformality. Conformality is very important for air navigation charts. For any projection to be
conformal, the scale at any point must be independent of azimuth. This does not imply, however, that the
scale at two points at different latitudes will be equal. It means the scale at any given point will, for a
short distance, be equal in all directions.

1.22.1.1. For conformality, the outline of areas on the chart must conform in shape to the feature being
portrayed. This condition applies only to small and relatively small areas; large land masses must
necessarily reflect any distortion inherent in the projection.

1.22.1.2. Finally, since the meridians and parallels of earth intersect at right angles, the longitude and
latitude lines on all conformal projections must exhibit this same perpendicularly. This characteristic
facilitates the plotting of points by geographic coordinates.

1.22.2. Constant Scale. The property of constant scale throughout the entire chart is highly desirable but
impossible to obtain, as it would require the scale to be the same at all points and in all directions
throughout the chart.

1.22.3. Straight Line. The rhumb line and the great circle are the two curves that a navigator might wish
to have represented on a map as straight lines. The only projection that shows all rhumb lines as straight
lines is the Mercator. The only projection that shows all great circles as straight lines is the gnomonic
projection. However, this is not a conformal projection and cannot be used directly for obtaining
direction or distance. No conformal chart will represent all great circles as straight lines.

1.22.4. True Azimuth. It would be extremely desirable to have a projection that showed directions or
azimuths as true throughout the chart. This would be particularly important to the navigator, who must
determine from the chart the heading to be flown. There is no chart projection representing true great
circle direction along a straight line from all points to all other points.

1.22.5. Coordinates Easy to Locate. The geographic latitudes and longitudes of places should be easily
found or plotted on the map when the latitudes and longitudes are known.
38                                                                     AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Section 1Fâ€”Classification of Projections

1.23. Introduction. Chart projections may be classified in many ways. In this pamphlet, the various
projections are divided into three classes according to the type of developable surface to which the
projections are related. These classes are azimuthal, cylindrical, and conical.

1.24. Azimuthal Projections. An azimuthal or zenithal projection is one in which points on the earth are
transferred directly to a plane tangent to the earth. According to the positioning of the plane and the
point of projection, various geometric projections may be derived. If the origin of the projecting rays
(point of projection) is the center of the sphere, a gnomonic projection results. If it is located on the
surface of the earth opposite the point of the tangent plane, the projection is a stereographic, and if it is at
infinity, an orthographic projection results. Figure 1.20 shows these various points of projection.


Figure 1.20. Azimuthal Projections.




1.24.1. Gnomonic Projection. All gnomonic projections are direct perspective projections. Since the
plane of every great circle cuts through the center of the sphere, the point of projection is in the plane of
every great circle. This property then becomes the most important and useful characteristic of the
gnomonic projection. Each and every great circle is represented by a straight line on the projection. A
complete hemisphere cannot be projected onto this plane because points 90o from the center of the map
project lines parallel to the plane of projection. Because the gnomonic is nonconformal, shapes or land
masses are distorted, and measured angles are not true. At only one point, the center of the projection,
are the azimuths of lines true. At this point, the projection is said to be azimuthal. Gnomonic projections
are classified according to the point of tangency of the plane of projection. A gnomonic projection is
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                         39

polar gnomonic when the point of tangency is one of the poles, equatorial gnomonic when the point of
tangency is at the equator and any selected meridian (Figure 1.21).


Figure 1.21. Polar Gnomonic and Stereographic Projections.




1.24.2. Stereographic Projection. The stereographic projection is a perspective conformal projection of
the sphere.

1.24.2.1. The term oblique stereographic is applied to any stereographic projection where the center of
the projection is positioned at any point other than the geographic poles or the equator.

1.24.2.2. If the center is coincident with one of the poles of the reference surface, the projection is called
polar stereographic. The illustration in Figure 1.21 shows both gnomonic and stereographic projections.

1.24.2.3. If the center lies on the equator, the primitive circle is a meridian, which gives the name
meridian stereographic or equatorial stereographic.

1.25. Cylindrical Projections. The only cylindrical projection used for navigation is the Mercator,
named after its originator, Gerhard Mercator (Kramer), who first devised this type of chart in the year
1569. The Mercator is the only projection ever constructed that is conformal and at the same time
displays the rhumb line as a straight line. It is used for navigation, for nearly all atlases (a word coined
by Mercator), and for many wall maps.

1.25.1. Imagine a cylinder tangent to the equator, with the source of projection at the center of the earth.
It would appear much like the illustration in Figure 1.22, with the meridians being straight lines and the
parallels being unequally spaced circles around the cylinder. It is obvious from the illustration that those
parts of the terrestrial surface close to the poles could not be projected unless the cylinder was
tremendously long, and the poles could not be projected at all.
40                                                                 AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

Figure 1.22. Cylindrical Projection.




1.25.2. On the earth, the parallels of latitude are perpendicular to the meridians, forming circles of
progressively smaller diameters as the latitude increases. On the cylinder, the parallels of latitude are
shown perpendicular to the projected meridians but, since the diameter of a cylinder is the same at any
point along the longitudinal axis, the projected parallels are all the same length. If the cylinder is cut
along a vertical line (a meridian) and spread flat, the meridians appear as equal-spaced, vertical lines,
and the parallels as horizontal lines, with distance between the horizontal lines increasing with distance
away from the false (arbitrary) meridian.

1.25.3. The cylinder may be tangent at some great circle other than the equator, forming other types of
cylindrical projections. If the cylinder is tangent at some meridian, it is a transverse cylindrical
projection; if it is tangent at any point other than the equator or a meridian, it is called an oblique
cylindrical projection. The patterns of latitude and longitude appear quite different on these projections
because the line of tangency and the equator no longer coincide.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                         41

1.25.4. The Mercator projection is a conformal, nonperspective projection; it is constructed by means of
a mathematical transformation and cannot be obtained directly by graphical means. The distinguishing
feature of the Mercator projection among cylindrical projections is: At any latitude the ratio of expansion
of both meridians and parallels is the same, thus, preserving the relationship existing on the earth. This
expansion is equal to the secant of the latitude, with a small correction for the ellipticity of the earth.
Since expansion is the same in all directions and since all directions and all angles are correctly
represented, the projection is conformal. Rhumb lines appear as straight lines and their directions can be
measured directly on the chart. Distance can also be measured directly, but not by a single distance scale
on the entire chart, unless the spread of latitude is small. Great circles appear as curved lines, concave to
the equator or convex to the nearest pole. The shapes of small areas are very nearly correct, but are of
increased size unless they are near the equator as shown in Figure 1.23. The Mercator projection has the
following disadvantages:

1.25.4.1. Measuring large distances accurately is difficult.

1.25.4.2. Must apply conversion angle to great circle bearing before plotting.

1.25.4.3. Is useless above 80o N or below 80o S since the poles cannot be shown.


Figure 1.23. Mercator Is Conformal but Not Equal Area.




1.25.5. The transverse or inverse Mercator is a conformal map designed for areas not covered by the
equatorial Mercator. With the transverse Mercator, the property of straight meridians and parallels is
lost, and the rhumb line is no longer represented by a straight line. The parallels and meridians become
complex curves and, with geographic reference, the transverse Mercator is difficult to use as a plotting
42                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

chart. The transverse Mercator, though often considered analogous to a projection onto a cylinder, is in
reality a nonperspective projection, constructed mathematically. This analogy (illustrated in Figure 1.24),
however, does permit the reader to visualize that the transverse Mercator will show scale correctly along
the central meridian which forms the great circle of tangency. In effect, the cylinder has been turned 90o
from its position for the ordinary Mercator, and a meridian, called the central meridian, becomes the
tangential great circle. One series of NIMA charts using this type of projection places the cylinder
tangent to the 90o Eâ€“90o W longitude.


Figure 1.24. Transverse Cylindrical Projectionâ€”Cylinder Tangent at the Poles.




1.25.5.1. These projections use a fictitious graticule similar to, but offset from, the familiar network of
meridians and parallels. The tangent great circle is the fictitious equator. Ninety degrees from it are two
fictitious poles. A group of great circles through these poles and perpendicular to the tangent constitutes
the fictitious meridians, while a series of lines parallel to the plane of the tangent great circle forms the
fictitious parallels.

1.25.5.2. On these projections, the fictitious graticule appears as the geographical one ordinarily
appearing on the equatorial Mercator. That is, the fictitious meridians and parallels are straight lines
perpendicular to each other. The actual meridians and parallels appear as curved lines, except the line of
tangency. Geographical coordinates are usually expressed in terms of the conventional graticule. A
straight line on the transverse Mercator projection makes the same angle with all fictitious meridians, but
not with the terrestrial meridians. It is, therefore, a fictitious rhumb line.

1.25.5.3. The appearance of a transverse Mercator using the 90o Eâ€“90o W meridian as a reference or
fictitious equator is shown in Figure 1.24. The dotted lines are the lines of the fictitious projection. The
Nâ€“S meridian through the center is the fictitious equator, and all other original meridians are now curves
concave on the Nâ€“S meridian with the original parallels now being curves concave to the nearer pole.To
straighten the meridians, use the graph in Figure 1.25 to extract a correction factor that will
mathematically straighten the longitudes.

1.26. Conic Projections. There are two classes of conic projections. The first is a simple conic
projection constructed by placing the apex of the cone over some part of the earth (usually the pole) with
the cone tangent to a parallel called the standard parallel and projecting the graticule of the reduced earth
onto the cone as shown in Figure 1.26. The chart is obtained by cutting the cone along some meridian
and unrolling it to form a flat surface. Notice, in Figure 1.27, the characteristic gap appears when the
cone is unrolled. The second is a secant cone, cutting through the earth and actually contacting the
surface at two standard parallels as shown in Figure 1.28.

Figure 1.28. Conic Projection Using Secant Cone.




1.26.1. Lambert Conformal (Secant Cone). The Lambert conformal conic projection is of the conical
type in which the meridians are straight lines that meet at a common point beyond the limits of the chart
and parallels are concentric circles, the center of each being the point of intersection of the meridians.
Meridians and parallels intersect at right angles. Angles formed by any two lines or curves on the earth's
surface are correctly represented. The projection may be developed by either the graphic or mathematical
method. It employs a secant cone intersecting the spheroid at two parallels of latitude, called the standard
parallels, of the area to be represented. The standard parallels are represented at exact scale. Between
these parallels, the scale factor is less than unity and, beyond them, greater than unity. For equal
distribution of scale error (within and beyond the standard parallels), the standard parallels are selected
at one-sixth and five-sixths of the total length of the segment of the central meridian represented. The
development of the Lambert conformal conic projection is shown by Figure 1.29.

46                                                                   AFPAM11-216         1 MARCH 2001

1.26.2. Uses. The chief use of the Lambert conformal conic projection is in mapping areas of small
latitudinal width but great longitudinal extent. No projection can be both conformal and equal area but,
by limiting latitudinal width, scale error is decreased to the extent the projection gives very nearly an
equal area representation in addition to the inherent quality of conformality. This makes the projection
very useful for aeronautical charts.

1.26.3. Advantages. Some of the chief advantages of the Lambert conformal conic projection are:

1.26.3.1. Conformality.

1.26.3.2. Great circles are approximated by straight lines (actually concave toward the midparallel).

1.26.3.3. For areas of small latitudinal width, scale is nearly constant. For example, the United States
may be mapped with standard parallels at 33o N and 45o N with a scale error of only 2 percent for
southern Florida. The maximum scale error between 30o30' N and 47o30' N is only one-half of 1 percent.

1.26.3.4. Positions are easily plotted and read in terms of latitude and longitude. Construction is
relatively simple.

1.26.3.5. Its two standard parallels give it two lines of strength (lines along which elements are
represented true to shape and scale).

1.26.3.6. Distance may be measured quite accurately. For example, the distance from Pittsburgh to
Istanbul is 5,277 NM; distance as measured by the graphic scale on a Lambert projection (standard
parallels 36o N and 54o N) without application of the scale factor is 5,258 NM; an error of less than four-
tenths of 1 percent.

1.26.4. Limitations. Some of the chief limitations of the Lambert Conformal conic projection are:

1.26.4.1. Rhumb lines are curved lines which cannot be plotted accurately.

1.26.4.2. Maximum scale increases as latitudinal width increases.

1.26.4.3. Parallels are curved lines (arcs of concentric circles).

1.26.4.4. Continuity of conformality ceases at the junction of two bands, even though each is conformal.
If both have the same scale along their standard parallels, the common parallel (junction) will have a
different radius for each band and will not join perfectly.

1.26.5. Constant of the Cone. Most conic charts have the constant of the cone (convergence factor)
computed and listed on the chart somewhere in the chart margin.

1.26.6. Convergence Angle (CA). The CA is the actual angle on a chart formed by the intersection of
the Greenwich meridian and another meridian; the pole serves as the vertex of the angle. CAs, like
longitudes, are measured east and west from the Greenwich meridian.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        47

1.26.7. Convergence Factor (CF). A chart's CF is a decimal number which expresses the ratio between
meridional convergence as it actually exists on the earth and as it is portrayed on the chart. When the
convergence angle (CA) equals the number of the selected meridian, the chart CF is 1.0. When the CA is
less than the number of the selected meridian, the chart CF is proportionately less than 1.0.

1.26.7.1. The subpolar projection illustrated in Figure 1.30 portrays the standard parallels, 37o N and 65o
N. It presents 360o of the earth's surface on 282.726o of paper. Therefore, the chart has a CF of 0.78535
(282.726o divided by 360o equals 0.78535). Meridian 90o W forms a west CA of 71o with the Greenwich
meridian.

1.26.7.2. Express as a formula:

CF X longitude = CA

0.78535 X 90o W = 71o west CA

1.26.7.3. Approximate a chart's CF on subpolar charts by drawing a straight line covering 10 lines of
longitude and measuring the true course at each end of the line, noting the difference between them, and
dividing the difference by 10. NOTE: The quotient represents the chart's CF.

Section 1Gâ€”Aeronautical Charts

1.27. Basics. An aeronautical chart is a pictorial representation of a portion of the earth's surface upon
which lines and symbols in a variety of colors represent features or details seen on the earth's surface. In
addition to ground image, many additional symbols and notes are added to indicate navigational aids
(NAVAID) and data necessary for air navigation. Properly used, a chart is a vital adjunct to navigation;
improperly used, it may become a hazard. Without it, modern navigation would never have reached its
48                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

present state of development. Because of their great importance, the navigator must be thoroughly
familiar with the wide variety of aeronautical charts and understand their many uses.

1.27.1. Lambert Conformal. Aeronautical charts are produced on many different types of projections.
Since the demand for variety in charts is so great and the properties of the projections vary greatly, there
is no one projection satisfying all navigation needs. The projection that most nearly answers all of the
navigator's problems is the Lambert conformal, and this projection is the one most widely used for
aeronautical charts. An aeronautical chart of some projection and scale can be obtained for any portion
of the earth.

1.27.2. Datums. Maps made by a given country traditionally use the datum created by that country.
There may be as many as a thousand of these various datums in use throughout the world. Inherent
problems result from over a hundred countries using widely different methods and standards to measure
coordinate systems. When added to the effects of local variations in topography and the gravity field,
systems are created that differ substantially from each other. These individualized datums are classified
as local or regional.

1.27.2.1. The Department of Defense adopted a datum in 1987 called World Geodetic System 84 (WGS
84). This global datum is a system that models the entire planet, instead of one small piece. WGS 84 is
used by NIMA for production of almost all new maps and charts. The purpose of such a system is to
minimize the confusion created by the proliferation of local datums. As long as all coordinates are stated
in WGS 84, combat interoperability problems will be minimized. In addition, WGS 84 positions may be
computed from Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment to an extreme level of precision by NIMA
surveyors, well under half a meter anywhere in the world. Widespread use of WGS 84 will virtually
eliminate problems due to different datums.

1.27.2.2. It is important to realize that every coordinate is related to a specific datum. A latitude and
longitude extracted from a WGS 84 chart is still a WGS 84 coordinate, and an MGRS point pulled from
that same chart is also WGS 84. However, a ground survey of that same point could have established a
local datum coordinate that is different from the map derived one by as much as a half mile. Always use
the same datum throughout your mission, or serious positional errors are possible.

1.28. Scale. Obviously, charts are much smaller than the area they represent. The ratio between any
given unit of length on a chart and the true distance it represents on the earth is the scale of the chart.
The scale will vary, and may vary greatly from one part of the chart to another. Charts are made to
various scales for different purposes. If a chart is to show the whole world and yet not be too large, it
must be drawn to small scale. If a chart is to show much detail, it must be drawn to a large scale; then it
shows a smaller area than does a chart of the same size drawn to a small scale. Remember: large area,
small scale; small area, large scale.

1.28.1. Aeronautical Chart. The scale of a chart may be given by a simple statement, such as "1 inch
equals 10 miles." This means a distance of 10 miles on the earth's surface is shown 1 inch long on the
chart. On aeronautical charts, the scale is indicated in one of two ways: representative fraction or graphic
scale.

1.28.2. Representative Fraction. The scale may be given as a representative fraction, such as 1:500,000
or 1/500,000. This means one of any unit on the chart represents 500,000 of the same unit on the earth.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        49

For example, 1 inch on the chart represents 500,000 inches on the earth. A representative fraction can be
converted into a statement of miles to the inch. Thus, if the scale is 1:1,000,000, 1 inch on the chart
stands for 1,000,000 inches or 1,000,000 divided by (6076 x 12) equaling about 13.7 NM. Similarly, if
the scale is 1:500,000, 1 inch on the chart represents about 6.86 NM. Thus, the larger the denominator of
the representative fraction, the smaller the scale.

1.28.3. Graphic Scale. The graphic scale may be shown by a graduated line. It usually is found printed
along the border of a chart. Take a measurement on the chart and compare it with the graphic scale of
miles. The number of miles the measurement represents on the earth may be read directly from the
graphic scale on the chart. The distance between parallels of latitude also provides a convenient scale for
distance measurement. One degree of latitude always equals 60 NM and 1 minute of latitude always
equals 1 NM.

1.29. DoD Charts and Flight Information Publications. The DoD NIMA publishes the National
Imagery and Mapping Agency Catalog of Maps, Charts and Related Products, which contains the latest
indexes of navigational and planning charts. This catalog also contains the most current list of Flight
Information Publications (FLIP) used by aircrews. This publication is available to aircrews in base
operations, flight planning rooms, and other locations where aeronautical charts are issued or where
flight planning takes place.

1.30. Chart Currency and Updating Information:

1.30.1. DoD Bulletin Digest. This document provides a complete cumulative listing of current chart
editions available for distributions of users. Information available in these documents (within each chart
series) is the chart number, current edition and date of edition.

1.30.2. DoD Chart Updating Manual (CHUM). This document lists, for each current chart edition,
corrections and additions which could affect flying safety. The unclassified CHUM should be in all flight
planning rooms. The additions and corrections listed for the appropriate charts should be checked and
the applicable ones annotated on the charts. NOTE: The CHUM does not contain manmade obstacles
less than 199 feet tall. CHUM data is also available on-line at some base operations facilities.

1.30.3. Types of Charts. Aeronautical charts are differentiated on a functional basis by the type of
information they contain. Navigation charts are grouped into three major types: general purpose, special
purpose, and plotting. The name of the chart is a reasonable indication of its intended use. A Minimal
Flight Planning Chart is primarily used in minimal flight planning techniques; and a Jet Navigation
Chart has properties making it adaptable to the speed, altitude, and instrumentation of jet aircraft. In
addition to the specific type of information contained, charts vary according to the amount of
information displayed. Charts designed to facilitate the planning of long distance flights carry less detail
than those required for navigation en route. Local charts present great detail.

1.31. Chart Symbols:

1.31.1. Standard Symbols. Symbols are used for easy identification of information portrayed on
aeronautical charts. While these symbols may vary slightly between various projections, the amount of
variance is slight and, once the basic symbol is understood, variations of it are easy to identify. A chart
50                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

legend is the key to explaining the meaning of the relief, culture, hydrography, vegetation, and
aeronautical symbols, as shown in Figure 1.31.


Figure 1.31. Sample Chart Legend.




1.31.2. Relief (Hypsography). Chart relief shows the physical features related to the differences in
elevation of land surface. These include features such as mountains, hills, plateaus, plains, depressions,
etc. Standard symbols and shading techniques are used in relief portrayal on charts; these include
contours, spot elevations and variations in tint, and shading to represent shadows.

1.31.3. Contour Lines. A contour is a line connecting points of equal elevation. Figure 1.32 shows the
relationship between contour lines and terrain. Notice on steep slopes the contours are close together and
on gentle slopes they are farther apart. The interval of the contour lines usually depends upon the scale of
the chart and the terrain depicted. In the illustration, the contour interval is 1,000 feet. Depression
contours are regular contour lines with spurs or ticks added on the downslope side.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       51

Figure 1.32. Contour Lines.




1.31.4. Spot Elevations. Spot elevations are the height of a particular point of terrain above an
established datum, usually sea level.

1.31.5. Gradient Tints. The relief indicating contours is further emphasized on charts by a system of
gradient tints. They are used to designate areas within certain elevation ranges by different color tints.

1.31.6. Shading. Perhaps the most obvious portrayal of relief is supplied by graduated shading applied
to the southeastern side of elevated terrain and the northwestern side of depressions. This shading
simulates the shadows cast by elevated features, lending a sharply defined, three-dimensional effect.

1.31.7. Cultural Features. All structural developments appearing on the terrain are known as cultural
features. Three main factors govern the amount of detail given to cultural features: (1) the scale of the
chart, (2) the use of the chart, and (3) the geographical area covered. Populated places, roads, railroads,
installations, dams, bridges, and mines are some of the many kinds of cultural features portrayed on
aeronautical charts. The true representative size and shape of larger cities and towns are shown.
Standardized coded symbols and type sizes are used to represent smaller population centers. Some
symbols denoting cultural features are usually keyed in a chart legend. However, some charts use
pictorial symbols which are self-explanatory.

1.31.8. Hydrography. In this category, aeronautical charts depict oceans, coast lines, lakes, rivers,
streams, swamps, reefs, and numerous other hydrographic features. Open water may be portrayed by
tinting or vignetting, or may be left blank.

1.31.9. Vegetation. Vegetation is not shown on most small scale charts. Forests and wooded areas in
certain parts of the world are portrayed on some medium scale charts. On some large scale charts, park
areas, orchards, hedgerows, and vineyards are shown. Portrayal may be by solid tint, vignette, or
supplemented vignette.

Figure 1.33. Summary of Typical Charts.




1.31.10. Aeronautical Information. In the aeronautical category, coded chart symbols denote airfields,
radio aids to navigation, commercial broadcasting stations, Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ),
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       53

compulsory corridors, restricted airspace, warning notes, lines of magnetic variation, and special
navigational grids. Some aeronautical information is subject to frequent change. For economy of
production, charts are retained in stock for various periods of time. To keep the charts current, only the
stable kinds of information are printed on navigation charts. Aeronautical type data subject to frequent
change is provided the user by the DoD FLIP documents. Consult the DoD CHUM and notices to airmen
(NOTAM) for the most current air information and chart information.

1.32. Requisitioning Charts and Flight Information Publications:

1.32.1. NIMA produces and distributes all aeronautical charts and FLIP documents. A summary of the
typical charts is in Figure 1.33. Requisitions should indicate item identification and terminology for each
item requested as listed in the catalog. List aeronautical charts by series in numerical or alphabetical
sequence; list FLIP documents by type (en route, planning, terminal), title, and geographic area of
coverage.

1.32.2. When requisitioning, refer to the sample requisition shown in the DoD catalog to expedite
processing and prompt shipment of chart and flight information needs.

1.32.3. The Air Force Intelligence Agency is responsible for all Air Force mapping, charting, and
geodesy (MC&G) matters. Many times in the tactical operation of the Air Force, pilots and navigators
need new or additional cartographic support in performing their navigational duties. The following
information tells them how to submit requirements for developing or modifying MC&G products.

1.32.4. Contact NIMA or its squadrons and detachments for technical assistance in preparing statements
of requirements. Addresses are listed in the NIMA Catalog of Maps, Charts, and Related Products.

Section 1Hâ€”Position Referencing Systems

1.33. Basics. The spherical coordinate system of latitude and longitude sometimes proves difficult to use
because its units of degrees, minutes, and seconds are not comparable to the normal units of surface
measurement. Further, the geographic graticule is not printed in its entirety on most topographic maps.
Consideration for the above factors led to the development of military grid systems in an effort to
simplify and increase the accuracy of position referencing. As early as World War I, the French
superimposed a military grid on maps of small areas in order to control artillery fire. After World War I,
a number of nations followed the example of the French-devised military grid system for use by their
military forces.

1.34. Terms Explained:

1.34.1. Military Grid. A military grid (Figure 1.34) is composed of two series of equally spaced parallel
lines perpendicular to each other. The grid is constructed by first establishing an origin. Next,
perpendicular axes are drawn through the origin with one of them pointing to true north. North-south
grid lines (eastings) and east-west grid lines (northings) are then drawn parallel and perpendicular,
respectively, to the north-south axis. On military maps of scale 1:75,000 and larger, the distance between
successive grid lines (grid interval) represents 1,000 meters (or yards) at the scale of the map. The
military grid is superimposed on charts and maps to permit accurate identification of ground positions
and to allow the computing or measuring of correct distances and directions from one point to another.
54                                                                AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

The origin is assigned false values to avoid coordinates of negative value. Grid lines are identified by
grid line values printed in two sizes of type in the margin at each end of the grid line. For referencing
purposes, only the grid line values printed in the larger type size (principal digits), increased by any
digits needed to express the reference to the desired degree of accuracy, are used. Grid line values
increase from west to east and from south to north.


Figure 1.34. Military Grid.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      55

1.34.2. Position Referencing System. A position referencing system is any system that permits the
designation of a point or an area on the earth's surface, usually in terms of numbers or letters, or a
combination thereof.

1.34.3. World Position Referencing System. References for points taken from charts or maps not
gridded with a military grid are expressed as geographic coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude.

1.34.4. Military Grid Reference System (MGRS). This is a position referencing system developed for
use with the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) and Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) grids.

1.34.5. World Geographic Reference System (GEOREF). This is a referencing system sometimes
employed by the Air Force in the control and direction of air forces engaged in operations not involving
other military forces.

1.35. DoD Policy for Position Referencing. It is possible for the practicing navigator to encounter any
or all of the basic reference systems discussed in this pamphlet. The DoD policy for position referencing
procedures for joint use by all the United States military services establishes two position referencing
systems for all joint operations as follows:

1.35.1. The system of geographic coordinates expressed in latitude and longitude.

1.35.2. The MGRS as developed for use with the UTM and UPS grids.

1.35.3. Because military grids are designed to permit accurate identification of ground locations and the
computation of distance and direction from one point to another, and because all map projections have
inherent distortion of scale and angles, it is essential that military grids be superimposed upon
projections having the least distortion. Conformal projections selected by the DoD as having the least
distortion of scale and angles for large and medium scale mapping are the transverse Mercator and the
polar stereographic. The military grid systems are applied to aeronautical charts primarily for use in Air
Force support of ground operations. The Air Force uses the UTM from latitude 80o S to 84o N and the
UPS from latitudes 84o N and 80o S to the respective poles. The standard unit of measure used with
UTM and UPS grids is the meter.

1.36. Military Grid Reference System (MGRS). The MGRS is designed for use with the UTM and
UPS grids. The world is divided into large regularly shaped geographic areas, each of which is given a
unique identification called the grid zone designation (GZD). These areas are subdivided into 100,000-
meter squares, based on the grid covering the area. Each square is identified by two letters called the
100,000-meter square identification. This identification is unique within the area covered by the GZD.
Numerical references within the 100,000-meter square are given to the desired accuracy in terms of the
east (E) and north (N) grid coordinates for the point.

1.36.1. GZD. Ordinarily, a reference keyed to a gridded map of any scale is made by giving the 100,000-
meter square identification together with the numerical term. The GZD usually is prefixed to the
identification when references are made in more than one grid zone.

1.36.2. GZD for UTM Grids. Between 72o N and 72o S, the globe is divided into areas 6o east-west by
8o north-south. Between 72o N and 84o N (72o S and 80o S) the bands are not always 6o wide. The
56                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

columns (6o wide) are identified by the UTM zone numbers; that is, starting at the 180o meridian and
proceeding easterly, the columns are numbered 1 through 60, consecutively (Figure 1.35). The rows (8o
high, except for the last which is 12o high) are identified by letters; starting at 80o S and proceeding
northerly to 84o N, the rows are lettered alphabetically C through X with the letters I and O omitted. The
GZD is determined by reading to the right the column designation (as 32), then up the row designation
(as T), to obtain 32T (Figure 1.35).


Figure 1.35. Designation of UTM Grid Zones.




1.36.3. 100,000-Meter Square Identification for UTM Grids. Between 84o N and 80o S, grid zone
areas are divided into 100,000-meter squares based on the UTM grid for the zone. Each column of
squares is identified by a letter and each row of squares is identified by a letter (Figure 1.36). Starting at
180o meridian and proceeding easterly along the equator for 18o, the 100,000-meter column, including
partial columns along grid junctions, are lettered alphabetically A through Z (with I and O omitted). This
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      57

alphabet is repeated at 18o intervals. The 100,000-meter rows are lettered alphabetically A through V (I
and O omitted) reading from south to north, with this partial alphabet being repeated every 2,000,000
meters. Normally, every odd-numbered UTM zone has the alphabet of the 100,000-meter row letters
beginning at the equator; the even-numbered UTM zones normally have the alphabet of the 100,000-
meter row letters beginning at the northing grid line 500,000 meters south of the equator. This staggering
lengthens the distance between 100,000-meter squares of the same identification. Below the equator,
100,000 row letters also read alphabetically from south to north, tying into the letters above in the same
zone. These principles are illustrated in Figure 1.36.

1.36.3.1. The identification of any 100,000-meter square is determined by reading (to the right) first its
column letter (as N) and (then up) to its row letter (as L) giving "NL" in Figure 1.37. Under this system,
a 100,000-meter square identification usually is not repeated within 18o in any direction. This normally
eliminates the necessity within such distance for preceding grid references with the GZD even though
the report is being made from as many as two grid zones away.

1.36.3.2. To prevent ambiguity of identifications along spheroid junctions, changes in the order of the
row letters are necessary. The row alphabet is shifted l0 letters. Thus, the maximum distance between the
same combination of letter identifiers is increased.

1.37. Locating a Military Grid Reference. A military grid reference consists of a group of letters and
numbers which indicate (1) the GZD, (2) the 100,000-meter square identification, and (3) the grid
coordinates of the point expressed to the desired accuracy. A reference is written as a continuous number
without spaces, parentheses, dashes, or decimal points.

1.37.1. Examples:

1.37.1.1. 32TNLâ€”Locating a point within a 100,000-meter square.

1.37.1.2. 32TNL73â€”Locating a point within a 10,000-meter square.

1.37.1.3. 32TNL7438â€”Locating a point within 1,000 meters.

1.37.1.4. 32TNL743385â€”Locating a point within 100 meters.

1.37.2. To satisfy special needs, a reference can be given to the nearest 10 meters and the nearest 1
meter. Examples:

1.37.2.1. 32TNL74343856â€”Locating a point within l0 meters.

1.37.2.2. 32TNL7434238565â€”Locating a point within l meter.

NOTE: Just because a UTM coordinate contains 10 digits does not mean it is accurate to within 1 meter.
It means the coordinate is precise to within one meter. For example, many GPS receivers will report a
position to within 1 meter, yet the signals used to derive that position are accurate only to 100 meters.
There is a difference!

1.37.3. Normally, all elements of a grid reference are not used. Those to be omitted depend upon the size
of the area of activities, the proximity of a spheroid junction, and the scale of the map to which the
reference is keyed (interval of grid lines). To give the position of a point, first give the GZD, then the
100,000-meter square, such as 32TNL. The designation 32TNL describes the 100,000-meter square (NL)
that is located in the 6o by 8o grid zone, 32T. The origin of every 100,000-meter square is 0.0. To
reference a point within a 100,000-meter square, give the grid coordinates of the point. The grid
coordinates are designated by an even number of digits. The first half of this number, no matter how
small or large, is the easting; the second half, the northing. The reference 32TNL7434238565 locates an
object within a 1-meter square. The number 74342 is the easting (read to the right) coordinate, while
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     59

38565 is the northing (read up) coordinate which locates a point within a 1-meter square of the 100,000-
meter square designated as NL and in grid zone 32T (Figure 1.38).


Figure 1.38. Grid Coordinates 32TNL7434238565 Identify a 1-Meter Square.




1.37.4. Sample Reference of UTM Grid. To illustrate the procedure for locating a point by the UTM
grid system, a fictitious example point identified within a reference box accompanies each grid overprint
as shown in Figure 1.39. Using the sample reference, the following procedure illustrates how to locate
the point whose standard reference is 32TNL7438:

1.37.4.1. 32Tâ€” identifies the 6o by 8o grid zone in which the point is located. NLâ€”identifies the
100,000-meter square in which the point is located.

1.37.4.2. 74â€”The numbers 7 and 4 are both right reading, or easting figures. The first of these two digits
(7) identifies the interval easting beyond which the point falls. The second digit (4) is estimated; it
represents the value of the imaginary 1,000-meter easting column which includes the point.

1.37.4.3. 38â€”The numbers 3 and 8 are both up reading, or northing figures. The 3 identifies the interval
northing beyond which the point falls. Finally, the 8 defines the 1,000-meter estimated northing required
to complete the area dimensions of the sample reference point.

1.37.5. GZD for UPS Grid. In the Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) grid zone, the North Polar Area
is divided into two parts by the 180o and 0o meridians. The half containing the west longitudes is given
the GZD Y; the half containing the east longitudes is given the GZD Z. No numbers are used in
conjunction with the letter to give a GZD. Similarly, the South Polar Area is divided into two parts by
the 0o and 180o meridians. The half containing the west longitude is identified as A; the half containing
the east longitude is identified as B. No numbers are used in conjunction with the letter to give a GZD.

1.37.6. 100,000-Meter Square Identification for UPS Grids. In the North Polar Area, the 180o â€“ 0o
meridians coincide with an even 100,000-meter vertical grid line and the 90o â€“ 90o meridians coincide
with an even 100,000-meter horizontal grid line. Grid north is coincident with the 180o meridian from
the Pole. In the half of the area identified by the GZD Y, the 100,000-meter columns (these are at right
angles to the 90o â€“ 90o meridians) are labeled R through Z alphabetically from left to right. In the half
identified by the GZD Z, the 100,000-meter columns are labeled A through J alphabetically from left to
right; in this case, the letter I is omitted, and to avoid confusion with 100,000-meter squares in adjoining
UTM zones, the letters, D, E, V and W are omitted. Starting at the 84o parallel and reading toward grid
north, the 100,000-meter rows at right angles to the 180o â€“ 0o meridians are alphabetically labeled A
through P (I and O omitted). The identification of a 100,000-meter square consists of two letters
determined by reading (right) its column letter and (up) its row letter. In the South Polar Area, a similar
plan is followed, except that grid north is coincident with the 0o meridian from the pole. In the half of the
area identified by the GZD A, the 100,000-meter columns (these are at right angles to the 90o â€“ 90o
meridians) are labeled J through Z alphabetically from left to right. In the half identified by the GZD B,
the 100,000-meter columns are labeled A through R alphabetically from left to right. In both cases, the
letters I and O are omitted and, to avoid confusion with 100,000-meter squares in adjoining UTM zones,
the letters D, E, M, N, V, and W are also omitted. Starting at the 80o parallel and reading toward grid
north, the 100,000-meter rows at right angles to the 180o â€“ 0o meridians are alphabetically labeled A
through Z (I and O omitted). The identification of a 100,000-meter square consists of two letters
determined by reading (right) its column letter and (up) to its row letter.

1.38. World Geographic Reference (GEOREF) System. The GEOREF system was developed by the
Air War College, Air University, as a worldwide geographic referencing system and is generally known
by its short title GEOREF. It makes use of the simplified system of always reading from left to right and
up, using a group of letters and numbers to locate a point, thus making the referencing of a point much
easier than using the geographic coordinates of latitude and longitude which require the giving of
latitude in degrees, minutes and seconds (north or south) and the longitude in degrees, minutes and
seconds (east or west). For example, to call in a reference to the nearest minute using geocoordinates, it
would be necessary to say 60o12' north, and 119o57' east as compared to a reference to the same point
using the GEOREF system VLAQ5712. The possibility of error in communicating a reference is greatly
reduced by the relatively simple GEOREF system.

1.38.1. Composition. The GEOREF system is based on the normal latitude and longitude values that
appear on all maps and charts. Instead of using a grid system of its own, as does the UTM grid and other
military grids, the GEOREF system makes use of the meridians and parallels that appear on the chart.
Basically, this system defines the unit geographic area in which a specific point lies. It may be applied to
any map or chart, regardless of the type of projection. The GEOREF is read to the right and up in all
cases. The point of origin is the 180th meridian and the South Pole. It extends to the right or eastward
from the 180th meridian around the globe, 360o to the 180th meridian again. It extends upward or
northward from the South Pole, 180o to the North Pole.

1.38.2. Referencing. The GEOREF divides the earth's surface into quadrangles of longitude and latitude
with a simple, brief, systematic code that gives positive identification to each quadrangle. The system
and identification codes include:

1.38.2.1. Twenty-four longitudinal zones of 15o each, which are lettered from A through Z (omitting I
and O) eastward from the 180th meridian. Twelve bands of latitude, each 15o wide, are lettered from A
62                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

through M (omitting I) northward from the South Pole. This combination divides the earth's surface into
288 basic 15o quadrangles, each identified by two letters. In local operations confined to a single chart or
to a single 15o quadrangle, these letters may be dropped. On small scale charts, the letter designators are
shown in large letters in the southwest corner of each 15o quadrangle. On larger scale charts, the 15o
quadrangle designators are shown along the border. When the southwest corner of a 15o quadrangle falls
in the chart area, the designators also are shown in the southwest corner of the quadrangle. The
worldwide breakdown is illustrated by Figure 1.40.

Figure 1.40. Location of 15o Quadrangle FJ, GEOREF Index.




1.38.2.2. Each basic 15o quadrangle is divided into 15 lettered 1o units eastward and 15 lettered 1o units
northward from A through Q (omitting I and O). Thus, two additional letters (four in all) identify any 1o
quadrangle in the world. Figure 1.41 illustrates the alphabetical breakdown of a 15o quadrangle.

1.38.2.3. Each 1o quadrangle is divided into 60 numbered minute units eastward and northward. Thus,
four letters and four figures identify a 1-minute quadrangle anywhere in the world. This break-down
permits location of a point within approximately 1 NM. This manner of numbering is used when the 1o
quadrangle is located; it does not vary even though the location may be west of the Greenwich meridian
or south of the equator. The GEOREF minutes of longitude always increase from west to east, and the
GEOREF minutes of latitude always increase from south to north. This is contrary to the geographic
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     63

minutes of latitude in the Southern Hemisphere and the geographic minutes of longitude in the Western
Hemisphere.

Figure 1.41. GEOREF 15o Quadrangle FJ Breakdown into 1o.




1.38.2.4. If references of greater accuracy than 1 minute are required, each 1-minute quadrangle may be
further subdivided into decimal parts eastward and northward. Four letters and six figures define a
location of one-tenth part of a minute; four letters and eight figures to one-hundredth part of a minute,
etc.

1.38.2.5. A reference box is required on all charts overprinted by GEOREF. This box illustrates the
standard reference procedures by a fictitious example (Figure 1.42).

Figure 1.42. GEOREF Simple Reference.
64                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

1.38.3. Sample Reference. A GEOREF reference consists of all letters and number characters arranged
in right and up reading order and in largest to smallest area sequence. References are written and read as
a continuous series of characters without spaces or punctuation. For example, FJQH1256 is the standard
reference that identifies the southwest corner of the town of Potosi, Missouri. Figure 1.43 shows the
procedure for locating this point.


Figure 1.43. To Locate FJQH 1256, Interpolate for 12 and 56.




1.38.3.1. FJâ€”identifies the basic 15o quadrangle.

1.38.3.2. QHâ€”identifies the 1o quadrangle.

1.38.3.3. 12â€” identifies the first minute of longitude to left of the point. (This value is read from left to
right.)

1.38.3.4. 56â€” identifies the first minute of latitude below the point. (This value is read from bottom to
top.)

1.38.4. Special Referencing Problems. In addition to making basic area references, it is often necessary
in air operations to indicate large area and altitude. Adaptations of the world GEOREF system with
respect to these requirements follow.

1.38.4.1. To designate a rectangular or square area other than the basic area referred to in the world
GEOREF system, the following procedure is used:

1.38.4.1.1. GEOREF coordinates of the southwest corner of the area.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                           65

1.38.4.1.2. Add the letter S denoting side, immediately following the GEOREF coordinates.

1.38.4.1.3. Add digits defining the west to east extent of the area in NM.

1.38.4.1.4. Add the letter X denoting multiplied by.

1.38.4.1.5. Add digits defining the south to north extent of the area in NM.

NOTE: The designation of the rectangular area in Figure 1.44 is EJQK2025S10X12.

1.38.4.2. To designate a circular area, reference its center by normal GEOREF coordinates, add the letter
R denoting radius and digits defining the radius in NM. Thus, the designation of the circular area in
Figure 1.44 is EJQK4550R12.


Figure 1.44. Examples of GEOREF Coordinates.




1.38.4.3. An altitude reference is designated by the letter H denoting height followed by digits, such as H
10. Two digits indicate thousands of feet, the most common reference. Should greater precision be
required, use three digits to indicate hundreds, four digits to indicate tens, and five digits to indicate units
of feet.

1.38.4.4. To designate Greenwich time, the letter Z is used, followed by two or four digits representing
hours or hours and minutes of the 24-hour clock.

1.39. Summary. The UTM, UPS, and GEOREF systems are all designed to facilitate location of definite
points on the earth's surface. They are used primarily when other conventional systems are difficult to
66                                                                AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

use. The various grid systems used for position location should not be confused with the grid directional
system. Grid directional overlays are used in polar navigation. The primary purpose of a grid directional
system is to establish a reference direction with regard to some point other than the North Pole. A full
explanation of the construction and use of the grid directional overlay is given in the chapter on grid
navigation.

                                         MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Introduction. Before boarding an aircraft, a navigator must thoroughly plan the mission. A well-
planned mission will provide a professional atmosphere, enhancing safety and accomplishment of
mission objectives. Also, adequate mission planning prior to flight can avoid unnecessary in-flight
problems. This chapter describes the navigator's mission planning. It begins with a discussion of air
traffic control systems, followed by a brief description of publications, with which a professional
navigator should be familiar. United States military publications used for flight planning and in-flight
purposes follow specific Air Force publications. Most of this chapter is devoted to general mission
planning considerations. All phases of ground planning are discussed, from chart selection to arrival
study.

Section 2Aâ€”Air Traffic Control System

2.2. Basics. Most nations of the world today have established airspace, air traffic units, and air traffic
services to promote a safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of traffic. Furthermore, in the interest of
standardization, many nations are establishing systems according to the standards and recommended
practices adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Navigators must understand
what these air traffic services are and how they can be used because military operations are directly
affected by these services.

2.3. Air Traffic Service. Air traffic service is a general term referring to any of the following services:

2.3.1. Air Traffic Control. A service provided by ground agencies to prevent collisions and to expedite
and maintain an orderly flow of traffic. Air traffic control includes such services as area and en route
control, approach control, and tower control. It is used primarily under instrument flight rules (IFR).

2.3.2. Advisory Service. This service is provided to give air information that is useful for the safe and
effective conduct of flight. This service is usually associated with the visual flight rules (VFR)
environment and includes such services as weather conditions, location of known traffic, status of
navigational aids (NAVAID), status of airports and facilities, etc.

2.3.3. Alerting Service. This is a service provided to notify applicable organizations regarding aircraft in
need of search and rescue aid and to assist such organizations as required.

2.4. Airspace. When it has been determined that air traffic services are to be provided, portions of the
airspace are designed in relation to the air traffic services that are required. Consult Flight Information
Publication (FLIP) for an in-depth explanation of airspace.

2.5. Air Traffic Service Units. These are the units that provide the air traffic service within defined
airspace.

2.5.1. Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC). This facility provides air traffic control to IFR
flights within controlled airspace.
68                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

2.5.2. Approach Control. This facility provides air traffic control to aircraft arriving at or departing
from one or more airports.

2.5.3. Airport Control Tower. This facility provides air traffic control service for airport traffic.

2.5.4. Flight Service Station (FSS). This facility is operated by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) to provide flight assistance service.

2.6. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). To establish international rules for air traffic
control, the ICAO was formed in April 1947. ICAO is affiliated with the United Nations as a specialized
international body dealing with aviation matters. The member states (refer to FLIP General Planning
[GP]) of the ICAO subscribe to ICAO rules and procedures. These rules and procedures are used except
for national deviations, which are usually filed with ICAO. Since standardization in ICAO is based upon
the same technical principles and policies which are in actual effect in the continental United States
(CONUS), American airmen can fly all major routes following the same general rules of the air, and
governed by the same traffic control service with which they are familiar at home.

2.6.1. The policy of the DoD is to support activities of the ICAO to standardize air facilities, services,
procedures, and practices. This standardization involves rules of the air, air traffic control, search and
rescue, communications and NAVAIDs, maps and charts, Flight Information Publications (FLIP),
meteorology, airports, and visual aids. Nations may adopt the ICAO standards, change them slightly, or
not adopt them at all in forming their rules of the air. United States military crews must comply with the
national rules of the foreign state being overflown. If the provisions of AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General
Flight Rules, conflict with the national rules of a foreign nation, the national rules apply. However, when
the provisions of these regulations do not conflict with, but are more restrictive than the national rules,
AFI 11-202, Volume 3 will apply. As a general policy, in international airspace over the high seas, Air
Force air operations are conducted according to ICAO standards and recommended practices, military
mission permitting.

2.6.2. United States military aircraft flying over a foreign country that is not a contracting state of ICAO
must comply with the national practices of that country. It must also adhere to any special provisions of
bilateral agreements the United States may have with that country. In the absence of any national
practice or bilateral agreements governing rules of the air, the ICAO rules and procedures are followed.

2.7. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The United States is a member of ICAO and follows
ICAO standards. Deviations from ICAO standards are filed with ICAO. The FAA is responsible for air
traffic services in the United States and its possessions according to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958,
which consolidated all air traffic regulatory agencies under the control of the FAA. Some of the
responsibilities of the FAA include:

2.7.1. Operates the air traffic control system within the United States airspace.

2.7.2. Establishes and ensures compliance with the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) which are
binding on the entire aviation community.

2.7.3. Issues licenses to aircrew members, maintenance personnel, and control tower operators.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                    69

2.7.4. Investigates aircraft accidents.

2.7.5. Maintains communication stations and NAVAIDs. Flight checks NAVAIDs.

Section 2Bâ€”Air Force Publications

2.8. Basics. The Air Force uses many publications to give direction, offer guidance, and explain policy
to Air Force personnel. The publications include Air Force letters, manuals, instructions, pamphlets, and
visual aids. Air Force navigators should familiarize themselves with the Air Force 11-series publications
which include such subjects as air navigation, instrument flying, airfield management and base
operations, NOTAMs, overdue aircraft, general flight rules, air traffic control procedures, aircraft
specific procedures, and the 91-series on safety publications.

2.8.1. You should become thoroughly familiar with the applicable flying publications. AFI 14-205,
Identifying Requirements for Obtaining and Using Geospatial Information and Services, is also of
special interest to navigators. This regulation provides guidance on the submission of mapping, charting,
and geodetic (MC&G) product requirements, and explains that the National Imagery and Mapping
Agency (NIMA) is available for technical assistance in defining cartographic requirements.

Section 2Câ€”Flight Planning Publications and Charts

2.9. Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG). Published by the Air Force, the FCG is used by all United States
military personnel traveling abroad. It provides information on all foreign nations, United States
possessions, and United States controlled or administered areas outside CONUS.

2.9.1. This information covers:

2.9.1.1. Aircraft diplomatic clearances and advance notice requirements.

2.9.1.2. Personnel clearance and entrance requirements.

2.9.1.3. Special restrictions and precautions.

2.9.1.4. General briefing information.

2.9.1.5. Material clearance requirements.

2.9.2. Additionally the FCG covers requirements of international agencies, unified and specified
commands, command activities exercising command prerogatives, joint missions, and advisory groups.

2.9.3. There is also a classified supplement to the FCG, so make sure you read the appropriate sections
before finalizing your plans.

2.10. Flight Information Publications (FLIP). Complete aeronautical information concerning air
traffic systems is published in FLIP. The DoD (the primary user) has directed that FLIP be published
covering the entire free world area. Published by the NIMA, FLIP are divided into three phases of
flightâ€”planning, en route operations, and terminal operations. The en route and terminal phase
70                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

publications have been divided into the following areas: (1) United States; (2) Alaska; (3) Canada and
North Atlantic; (4) Caribbean and South America; (5) Europe, North Africa, and Middle East; (6)
Africa; (7) Pacific, Australasia, and Antarctica; and (8) Eastern Europe and Asia.

2.10.1. General Planning (GP). This document is revised every 32 weeks with planning change notices
(PCN) issued at the 16-week midpoint. Urgent change notices (UCN) are issued as required. The FLIP
GP document contains information that is applicable worldwide. It is supplemented by the information
published in seven Area Publication Sections.

2.10.2. Area Planning (AP/1, 2, and 3). Located behind GP in the FLIP Planning document binder,
contain planning and procedure information for a specific geographical area. Area Planning Documents
1, 2, and 3 are respectively North and South America, Europe-Africa-Middle East, and Pacific-
Australasia-Antarctica.

2.10.3. Area Planning (AP/1A, 2A, and 3A). Located behind their respective Area Planning
documents, these publications contain a tabulation of all prohibited, restricted, danger, warning, and alert
areas. In addition, they contain intensive student jet training areas, military training areas, and known
parachute jumping areas within their specific geographical area.

2.10.4. Area Planning (AP/1B). Located behind AP/1A in the FLIP Planning document. AP/1B
contains information relative to military training routes in North and South America, including IFR and
VFR military training routes.

2.10.5. Planning Change Notices (PCN). These are in textual form and are used to update the FLIP
Planning document.

2.10.6. Flight Information Handbook (FIH). The FIH contains information for in-flight use. Sections
include emergency procedures, national and international flight data and procedures, meteorological
information, conversion tables and frequency pairings, standard time signals, and FLIP/NOTAM
abbreviations and codes.

2.10.7. FLIP En Route Charts. Charts portray airway systems, radio aids to navigation, airports,
airspace divisions and other aeronautical data for IFR operations. FLIP En Route Charts are divided into
high altitude (l8,000 feet MSL through FL450) for use in the jet route system, and low altitude (1,200
feet above the surface up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL) for use in the airway systems. Packets of
low and high altitude charts are available for each geographic area: CONUS; Alaska; Canada and North
Atlantic; Caribbean and South America; Europe, North Africa, and Middle East; Africa; Pacific,
Australasia, and Antarctica; and Eastern Europe and Asia.

2.10.8. FLIP En route Supplements. One is published for each geographical areas. Each supplement
contains an airport or facility directory, enroute procedures, special notices, and other textual data
required to support FLIP En Route Charts. In the United States, there are two supplements. One
supplement is designed for IFR operations and contains IFR airport and facility directory, special
notices, and procedures required to support the FLIP En Route and Area Charts. The other supplement is
designed for VFR operations and contains a listing of selected VFR airports with sketches and an IFR or
VFR city and airport cross-reference listing. In all other FLIP areas, airport sketches are published for a
limited number of selected airports and are provided with a separate section of the FLIP En Route
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       71

Supplement. Airport sketch details include airport identification, city name, distance, direction, and
elevation, as well as a diagram of each airport.

2.10.9. Area and Terminal Area Charts. These charts are large-scale graphics of selected terminal
areas. In the United States, area charts are provided primarily as area enlargements; in foreign areas, the
terminal area charts are published primarily to provide arrival and departure routings. The area and
terminal charts are printed on the same size sheet as the FLIP En Route Charts (that is, the terminal or
area sheet contains several terminal or area charts) and are distributed with the en route FLIP.

2.10.10. Approaches and DPs. FLIP terminal instrument approach procedures and military departure
procedures (DP) plates are divided into low altitude approaches (approaches initiated below 18,000 feet
MSL), high altitude approaches (approaches initiated normally at or above 18,000 feet MSL, such as
high performance aircraft), and military DPs. DPs and terminal instrument approach procedures contain
the DoD approved departure and instrument approach procedures. Each instrument approach procedure
shows an airport sketch, with additional data if necessary, for an approach under IFR conditions.

2.10.11. Terminal Change Notices (TCN). TCNs contain revisions to approach procedures and are
published normally at the midpoint of the FLIP terminal booklets. The changes may be in textual or
graphic form. In the United States area TCNs revise only the low altitude approaches; however, in the
Europe, North Africa, Middle East area, and Pacific, Australasia, and Antarctica areas, TCNs revise both
low and high altitude approaches. In the other four FLIP areas, TCNs are not published and NOTAMs
must be consulted for changes to approach procedures.

2.10.12. Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR). STARs contain preplanned IFR air traffic control
arrival routes and are published in graphic and/or textual form. STARs provide transition from the en
route structure to a fix or point from which an approach can be made. In Alaska, Pacific, Australasia, and
Antarctica areas, STAR information is contained in the FLIP terminal booklets. In the United States,
STARs are published in a bound booklet with civilian DPs.

2.10.13. Notice to Airman (NOTAM). A NOTAM is a message requiring expeditious and wide
dissemination by telecommunication means. NOTAMs provide information that is essential to all
personnel concerned with flight operations. NOTAM information is normally in the form of
abbreviations or a NOTAM code. The FIH contains an alphabetical list of these abbreviations.

Section 2Dâ€”Flight Planning

2.11. Basics. In the air, there is little time for lengthy processes of reasoning. Decisions must be made
quickly and accurately; therefore, careful planning is essential to any flight. A smooth, successful flight
requires a careful step-by-step plan, which can be followed from takeoff to landing.

2.12. Route Determination. When planning a route to be flown, many factors enter into consideration.
The route may be dictated by operational requirements of the mission; it may be a preplanned route, or
the navigator may have the prerogative of selecting the route to be flown. In any case, definite factors
affect route selection and the navigator must be aware of them.

2.12.1. In most cases, a direct route is usually best because it conserves both time and fuel. Such things
as airways, routing, high terrain, and bad weather, however, can affect this. The direction of prevailing
72                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

winds can affect route selection because the proper use of a jet stream often decreases total flying time,
even though a direct route is not flown.

2.13. Chart Selection. Once a route is established, navigation charts appropriate to the intended flight
path should be selected. Correct selection depends on distance to be flown, airspeeds, methods of
navigation, and chart accuracy.

2.13.1. Total Distance to Fly. A great circle is the shortest distance between two points. You can save
considerable distance by flying a great circle course, particularly on long-range missions in polar
latitudes. A straight line on a gnomonic chart represents a great circle course. One way to flight plan a
great circle course is to plot the entire route on a gnomonic chart, then transfer coordinates to charts
more suitable for navigation, such as a Transverse Mercator. Select coordinates at intervals of
approximately 300 NM. Once the route is plotted on the navigational chart, record true courses and
distances for each leg of the mission on the flight plan.

2.13.2. Chart and Methods of Navigation. The method of navigation is determined by mission
requirements and the flight mission area. Select charts for the mission which are best suited to the
navigational techniques chosen. For example, radar missions require charts with representative terrain
and cultural returns for precision fixing and grid missions require charts with a grid overlay. Charts
produced by NIMA are shown in Figure 2.1.

2.13.3. When To Use Separate Charts. When several navigational techniques are planned, it may be
convenient to use separate charts for different navigational legs. The entire route might be plotted on a
jet navigation chart (JNC) for pre-mission briefing, reference, etc.; the radar navigational legs plotted on
an operational navigation chart (ONC) to aid in precision fixing; and the target area plotted on a tactical
pilotage chart (TPC) for accurate target identification.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                          73

2.13.4. Scale. The scale of charts used for navigation varies inversely with the speed of the aircraft. For
example, JNCs have a small scale and contain features appropriate for high-speed navigation.
Navigation at slower speeds requires large-scale charts providing more detailed coverage.

2.13.5. NIMA Documents. The navigator should always ensure the chart being used is the latest edition.
The following listed documents published by NIMA provide this information:

2.13.5.1. DoD Bulletin Digest. The digest contains a listing of the current chart editions.

2.13.5.2. DoD Bulletin. The bulletin updates the Bulletin Digest and informs Air Force activities of the
availability of new aeronautical charts and new editions of previously published charts.

2.13.5.3. NIMA Aeronautical Chart Updating Manual (CHUM). The CHUM provides the latest chart
correction information. It is published semiannually with monthly supplements and contains a
cumulative listing of significant changes and additions to navigation and planning charts. A copy of the
CHUM is maintained in each base operations. CHUM is also available on line at most base operations.

2.13.6. NOTAMs. Interim aeronautical flight information changes are disseminated by NOTAMs, which
are available in each base operations until the change is provided in all pertinent FLIPs. NOTAMs also
provide the most current information on restrictions to flight, reliability of airport facilities and services,
en route hazards, radio aids, etc., NOTAMs are also available on line at most base operations.

Section 2Eâ€”Airways

2.14. Types and Use of Airways. Airways are corridors established by a national government within its
airspace to facilitate the navigation and control of air traffic under IFR conditions. Usually, an airway is
10 statute miles wide and follows a route over the ground defined by radio NAVAIDs.

2.14.1. Generally, there are many different airways within a country as evidenced by those established in
the United States. (NOTE: In the United States as well as in other countries, there are two sets of
airways (one for low altitudes and one for high altitudes.) To distinguish one airway from another, each
has its own designator, such as V (low altitude), and J (high altitude). These designators simplify the
preparation of a flight plan and improve the communication between aircrews and air traffic controllers.

2.14.2. Military aircrews are encouraged to use airways to simplify traffic control if the mission will
permit. The most current and complete information on airways is contained in the DoD FLIPs. There is
much information included in these documents which has significant interest to navigators, such as
magnetic courses, distances, compulsory reporting points, frequencies, and call signs of radio
NAVAIDS.

2.15. Alternate Airfield. An alternate airfield is where an aircraft intends to land if weather conditions
prevent landing at a scheduled destination. Occasionally, an airfield may also be identified as an
alternate for takeoff purposes. This procedure is at the direction of a major command that authorizes the
use of lower minimums for takeoff than for landing. The conditions under which an alternate airfield
must be selected and when it will be used are established by the Air Force in AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
74                                                                  AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

2.16. Emergency Airfields. During flight planning, select certain airfields along the planned flight route
as possible emergency landing areas and then annotate these airfields on the charts for quick reference.
Consider the following factors when selecting an emergency airfield: type of aircraft, weather
conditions, runway length, runway weight-bearing capacity, runway lighting, and radio NAVAIDs. The
NOTAMs for these airfields should be checked prior to flight.

2.17. Highest Obstruction. After the route has been determined, the navigator should study the area
surrounding the planned route and annotate the highest obstruction (terrain or cultural). The distance
within which the highest obstruction will be annotated is IAW governing or local directives. The highest
obstruction will be taken into consideration when determining the minimum en route altitude (MEA)
and in emergency procedures discussion.

2.18. Special Use Airspace. When determining the flight planned route, the locations of special use
airspace will have to be considered. The best way to find the locations of the areas is by checking an en
route chart. After the route is determined, any special use airspace that may be close enough to the route
of flight to cause concern (as per governing directives) should be annotated on the chart with pertinent
information. Annotate time and days of operation, effective altitudes, and any restriction applicable to
that area. These areas, when annotated on the chart, will assist the navigator with in-flight mission
changes and prevent planning a route of flight that cannot be flown.

Section 2Fâ€”Flight Plans

2.19. Manual Flight Plans. Flight plans differ in format between services and commands. To meet
specialized operational requirements, each command prescribes and issues its own navigation forms.
Typical completed flight plan forms are shown in Figures 2.2 and 2.3. There are slight differences in the
flight plan columns; the main differences are in the time and fuel analysis sections. The headings and
columns on the forms are self-explanatory.

2.20. Computer Flight Plans. Computer flight plans can be obtained from operations or weather
personnel prior to departure. The navigator computes only additional information required by local
procedures, such as equal time point (ETP) or fuel analysis. A typical computer flight plan is illustrated
in Figure 2.4. There are many different types of computer flight plans; they provide essentially the same
information, but in different formats.

2.21. Fuel Analysis. For the following fuel planning discussion, refer to Figure 2.2.

2.21.1. En Route Fuel. En route fuel is determined with a fuel graph such as the one depicted in Figure
2.5. Each type aircraft has a series of fuel graphs based on: (1) aircraft gross weight, (2) pressure or
density altitude, (3) true airspeed (TAS) or Mach number and on some aircraft, (4) the aerodynamic drag
of external stores. En route fuel is computed in a manner that will take into account the worst fuel
consumption situation, such as the lowest cruise altitude and highest airspeed. Most fuel graphs will be
designed for standard day conditions, so temperature deviation will have to be considered. En route fuel
can be calculated from the start descent point or initial approach fix (IAF), whichever is specified by the
command.

2.21.2. Fuel Reserve. This is the quantity of fuel carried in excess of mission requirements if the flight
is completed as planned. Major commands are authorized to establish fuel requirements for assigned
aircraft. In the absence of command established reserves, refer to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, for additional
information.

2.21.3. En route Plus Reserve. Add en route time and reserve time together to obtain the en route plus
reserve time. In some commands, this fuel is extracted from the fuel graph in the same manner as the en
route fuel.

2.21.4. Alternate Fuel. The fuel to the alternate is based on the fuel flow for the gross weight of the
aircraft at destination, the true airspeed (TAS) and altitude flown to the alternate. Some flight manuals
include graphs designed for computing fuel to the alternate, but the fuel can also be computed by adding
the time to the alternate and to the en route time. This time is then used to extract the total fuel required
from takeoff to alternate. En route fuel is then subtracted from this to obtain the fuel to the alternate. A
standard fuel amount may be added to allow for a missed approach at the original destination.

2.21.5. Holding Fuel. Adverse weather, air traffic, or aircraft malfunction in the terminal area may force
the aircraft to hold in the local area for a period of time before landing. The amount of holding fuel is
based on any planned delays according to applicable directives.

2.21.6. Approach and Landing Fuel. Approach and landing fuel is the fuel required from the terminal
fix to the runway. This is computed for a prescribed amount of time (usually 15 minutes). The amount of
fuel needed for approach and landing varies with the aircraft.

2.21.7. Total Takeoff or Flaps Up. This is the cumulative total fuel from takeoff or flaps up that is
required for en route, reserve, alternate, holding, and approach and landing.

2.21.8. Taxi and Runup. The fuel needed for taxiing, engine runup, and acceleration to takeoff speed. It
is usually a predetermined value for each type of aircraft.

2.21.9. Required Ramp Fuel. The amount of fuel required at engine start to complete the mission.

2.21.10. Actual Ramp Fuel. The fuel on board prior to engine start.

2.21.11. Unidentified Extra Fuel. Additional fuel over and above that required by the flight plan. It is
the difference between required ramp fuel and actual ramp fuel.

2.21.12. Burnoff Fuel. Burnoff is the planned amount of fuel to be used after takeoff. This value
subtracted from takeoff gross weight is equal to the approximate aircraft gross weight at landing.

2.22. Range Control Graph. The Range Control Graph portrays planned, minimum, and actual fuel
consumption. A typical range control graph is shown in Figure 2.6. It is used to flight plan fuel
consumption and serves as an in-flight worksheet for comparing actual and planned fuel consumption.
The range control graph can be constructed with information taken from a completed flight plan such as
Figure 2.2 and the applicable fuel planning graph (Figure 2.5). After calculating the required fuel at
checkpoints along the route, the fuel remaining (vertical) is plotted against time remaining (horizontal).
The planned fuel consumption is then plotted on the graph along with the minimum required fuel line.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     79

In-flight fuel readings are taken periodically and plotted on the graph to determine the fuel consumption
in relation to that planned.


Figure 2.6. Typical Range Control Graph.




2.22.1. The planned line is determined by calculating the fuel remaining and time remaining at
predetermined points in the mission and then plotting these points on the graph and connecting them
with a line. The minimum line is determined by adding up all fuel required as a minimum at the
destination (reserve, alternate, approach, etc.) and plotting it on the zero time remaining line. The
difference between the minimum fuel required and the planned fuel on the zero time remaining line is
then plotted below each of the predetermined fuel remaining points on the planned line. The points are
connected with a line that represents the minimum required fuel line. This line is used to determine
whether or not to continue the mission.

2.22.2. In-flight fuel readings are obtained and plotted against time remaining to determine fuel status.
These plotted points are then connected with a dotted line that represents the actual fuel consumption.
The trend of the in-flight fuel readings indicates actual fuel consumption and is used to make mission
decisions with regard to fuel.

2.23. Equal Time Point (ETP). The ETP (Figure 2.7) is that point along the route (normally one with
an extended overwater leg) from which it takes the same amount of time to return to departure (or the
80                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

last suitable airfield prior to beginning the overwater leg of the mission) as it would to continue to
destination (or the first suitable airfield for landing). The ETP is not necessarily the midpoint in time
from departure to destination. Its location is somewhere near the midpoint of the route (between suitable
airfields), and it is dependent upon the wind factors.


Figure 2.7. Equal Time Point.




2.23.1. A wind factor (WF) is a headwind or tailwind component, computed at planned altitude between
suitable airfields by comparing the average groundspeed (GS) to the average true airspeed (TAS). To do
this, algebraically subtract the TAS from the GS. A WF with a minus value is a headwind; positive is a
tailwind. When computing ETP, obtain a WF for each half of the route.

2.23.2. Wind factors may play a major role in determining whether or not you can reach your destination.
The overall or Total Wind Factor (TFW) is the average of WF1 and WF2 and is computed using the
formula (WF1 + WF2) divided by 2.

2.23.3. An ETP is computed using the following formula:




2.23.4. Total distance is the distance in NMs from the last suitable airfield to the first suitable airfield,
measured along the route of flight. WF2 and WF1 are wind factors for the second and first halves of the
route segment, respectively. T is the time remaining in minutes from the ETP to the first suitable airfield.
This time can be converted to distance by applying the GS for the second half of the route segment. The
distance can then be measured uptrack and the ETP plotted on the chart. The time should be plotted on
the range control graph with a vertical line that crosses both the planned and minimum lines. If the first
suitable airfield is not the planned landing airfield, then the time should be added between the first
suitable airfield and the landing airfield to determine the ETP.

2.24. Endurance. Endurance is the length of time an aircraft can remain airborne, not including
minimum required fuel. Endurance can be computed by taking the last plotted fuel reading and following
a line parallel to the fuel remaining lines in the direction of increasing time remaining until intercepting
the minimum line. This point and its corresponding time remaining represent the endurance at the time
of the fuel reading that is being used. Endurance is critical in making in-flight diversion decisions.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                         81

Section 2Gâ€”Route Study

2.25. Mission Planning. During mission planning, crewmembers should conduct a route study. For the
navigator, a route study encompasses three phases of flightâ€”takeoff and climb, cruise, and approach and
landing. The following paragraphs discuss these three areas in general terms as specific weapon systems,
and missions will most often differ in their objectives and parameters.

2.26. Takeoff and Climb. Before completing pre-flight planning you should be familiar with the
departure procedure filed. Check the NAVAIDs, such as tactical air navigation (TACAN), VHF
omnidirectional range (VOR) and automatic direction finder (ADF) to be used on the departure
procedure. Note magnetic headings, radials, or bearings and altitude restrictions. AFMAN 11-217,
Volumes 1 and 2, Instrument Flight Procedures, discuss as how to accurately monitor instrument
departures.

2.26.1. Duties. During takeoff and climb, the navigator's duties include monitoring the departure
procedure, copying clearances, and ensuring applicable altitude restrictions and terrain clearance are
maintained.

2.26.2. Estimated Times of Arrival (ETA). During climb-out, controlling authorities may request
ETAs, and generally it's the navigator's duty to compute these ETAs. Use the best source of groundspeed
to compute ETAs. As a backup, you can use the INS, flight-planned GS, or TACAN distance measuring
equipment (DME) change for groundspeed. When a controlled time of arrival is required, the navigator
should compute an indicated airspeed (IAS) or true airspeed (TAS) for the pilot to maintain when
approaching cruise altitude.

Section 2Hâ€”Cruise

2.27. Navigator's Duties. While the primary duty is to monitor and direct the progress of the aircraft,
the navigator must meet many associated requirements, such as completing the log, filling out forms,
working controlled ETAs, and analyzing the information received from the navigation equipment.

2.28. Log. The navigator's log is usually the only record of the aircraft's actual position at any given time
during the flight. For this reason, it must be accurate and complete. Log procedures vary between
organizations; however, the basic log requirements and purpose remain the sameâ€”to keep an accurate
record of data for the navigator's reference and debriefing purposes and to serve as a worksheet for the
navigator. Generally, required items for log entry are all information necessary to reconstruct the
mission.

2.29. Celestial Precomps. Like logs, celestial precomp forms also vary between organizations. Like the
log, the computational format may vary; however, the celestial computations themselves are essentially
the same.

Section 2Iâ€”Approach and Landing

2.30. Standard Approaches. The descent portion of the flight is similar to the climb portion. Instrument
approach plates are established for almost all airfields of any significance in the world. The published
approaches are normally flight-checked for safety of flight; if not, they are appropriately annotated. The
82                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

navigator must make certain that the route affords adequate terrain clearance given by the approach
control. Because of congested air traffic, approaches must be followed precisely. The navigator should
monitor the aircraft position and altitude during descent and advise the pilot of any deviations. AFMAN
11-217 discusses how to accurately monitor instrument approaches.

2.31. Airborne Radar Approach (ARA). Another type of approach to the terminal airfield is the
airborne radar approach. The ARA is an alternate procedure used when the other approaches are not
available. During an ARA, the navigator provides all directions and altitudes to the pilot. ARA letdown
plates are published for some airfields, and when one is not available, the navigator can construct one. A
typical ARA approach is shown in Figure 2.8. Compute the absolute altitude above field elevation for
each 1-mile increment from touchdown point on final approach, using the rate of descent and the final
approach speed for the aircraft being flown. Add the field elevation to each of the altitudes to compute
the correct indicated altitude for the pilot to fly.

2.31.1. Most major commands who do ARAs plan to reach to minimum descent altitude (MDA) at 2
NM and continue at that altitude to the missed approach point (MAP) at 1 NM.

2.31.2. The ARA may begin with or without ground based-vectors. In either case, once on the final
approach, the navigator is directing the aircraft. During the ARA, the navigator must keep the pilot
informed of the altitudes and headings to the runway.

2.32. Summary. In-flight duties for the navigator are many and diverse. As it is true that pilots earn their
money on takeoffs and landings, navigators earn their money during the cruise portion, but they are also
responsible for monitoring the departure and approach. Since crew safety and mission accomplishment
are affected by each crewmember's performance, the success of any mission depends in part on the
navigator's competence. Conscientious performance of in-flight duties can avert embarrassing and
dangerous situations for the entire crew.

Section 3Aâ€”Introduction

3.1. Basics. Instruments mechanically measure physical quantities or properties with varying degrees of
accuracy. Much of a navigator's work consists of applying corrections to the indications of various
instruments and interpreting the results. Therefore, navigators must be familiar with the capabilities and
limitations of the instruments available to them.

3.1.1. A navigator obtains the following flight information from basic instruments: direction, altitude,
temperature, airspeed, drift, groundspeed (GS).

3.1.2. Some of the basic instruments are discussed in this chapter. The more complex instruments which
make accurate and long distance navigation possible are discussed in later chapters or in specific aircraft
technical orders.

Section 3Bâ€”Direction

3.2. Basic Instruments. The navigator must have a fundamental background in navigation to ensure
accurate positioning of the aircraft. Dead reckoning (DR) procedures aided by basic instruments give the
navigator the tools to solve the three basic problems of navigation: position of the aircraft, direction to
destination, and time of arrival. Using only a basic instrument such as the compass and drift information,
you can navigate directly to any place in the world. Various fixing aids, such as celestial and radar, can
greatly improve the accuracy of basic DR procedures. This chapter will discuss the basic instruments
used for DR and then review the mechanics of DR, plotting, wind effect, and computer solutions.
Directional information needed to navigate is obtained by use of the earth's magnetic lines of force. A
compass system uses a device that detects and converts the energy from these lines of force to an
indicator reading. The magnetic compass operates independently of the aircraft electrical systems. Later
developed compass systems require electrical power to convert these lines of force to an aircraft heading.

3.3. Earth's Magnetic Field. The earth has some of the properties of a bar magnet; however, its
magnetic poles are not located at the geographic poles, nor are the two magnetic poles located exactly
opposite each other as on a straight bar. The north magnetic pole is located approximately at 73o N
latitude and 100o W longitude on Prince of Wales Island. The south magnetic pole is located at 68o S
latitude and 144o E longitude on Antarctica.

3.3.1. The earth's magnetic poles, like those of any magnet, can be considered to be connected by a
number of lines of force. These lines result from the magnetic field which envelops the earth. They are
considered to be emanating from the south magnetic pole and terminating at the north magnetic pole as
illustrated in Figure 3.1.

3.3.2. The force of the magnetic field of the earth can be divided into two components: the vertical and
the horizontal. The relative intensity of these two components varies over the earth so that, at the
magnetic poles, the vertical component is at maximum strength and the horizontal component is
minimum. At approximately the midpoint between the poles, the horizontal component is at maximum
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     85

strength and the vertical component is minimum. Only the horizontal component is used as a directive
force for a magnetic compass. Therefore, a magnetic compass loses its usefulness in an area of weak
horizontal force such as the area around the magnetic poles.


Figure 3.1. Earth's Magnetic Field Compared to a Bar Magnet.




3.3.3. The vertical component causes the end of the needle nearer to the magnetic pole to tip as the pole
is approached (Figure 3.1). This departure from the horizontal is called magnetic dip.

Section 3Câ€”Compasses

3.4. Basics. A compass may be defined as an instrument that indicates direction over the earth's surface
with reference to a known datum. Various types of compasses have been developed, each of which is
distinguished by the particular datum used as the reference from which direction is measured. Two basic
types of compasses are in current useâ€”the magnetic and gyrocompass.
86                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

3.4.1. The magnetic compass uses the lines of force of the earth's magnetic field as a primary reference.
Even though the earth's field is usually distorted by the pressure of other local magnetic fields, it is the
most widely used directional reference.

3.4.2. The gyrocompass uses as its datum an arbitrary fixed point in space determined by the initial
alignment of the gyroscope axis. Compasses of this type are widely used today and may eventually
replace the magnetic compass entirely.

3.5. Magnetic Compass. The magnetic compass indicates direction in the horizontal plane with
reference to the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field. This field is made up of the earth's
field in combination with other magnetic fields in the vicinity of the compass. These secondary fields are
caused by the presence of ferromagnetic objects, etc. Magnetic compasses may be divided into two
classes: (1) the direct-indicating magnetic compass in which the measurement of direction is made by a
direct observation of the position of a pivoted magnetic needle; and (2) the remote-indicating gyro-
stabilized magnetic compass. Magnetic direction is sensed by an element located at positions where local
magnetic fields are at a minimum, such as the vertical stabilizer and wing tips. The direction is then
transmitted electrically to repeater indicators on the instrument panels.


Figure 3.2. Magnetic Compass.




3.5.1. Direct-Indicating Magnetic Compass. Basically, the magnetic compass is a magnetized rod
pivoted at its middle, with several features incorporated to improve its performance. One type of direct-
indicating magnetic compass, the B-16 compass (often called the whiskey compass), is illustrated in
Figure 3.2. It is used as a standby compass in case of failure of the electrical system that operates the
remote compasses. It is a reliable compass and will give good navigational results if used carefully.

3.5.2. Magnetic Variation and Compass Errors. The earth's magnetic poles are joined by irregular
curves called magnetic meridians. The angle between the magnetic meridian and the geographic
meridian is called the magnetic variation. Variation is listed on the charts as east or west. When variation
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     87

is east, magnetic north (MN) is east of true north (TN). Similarly, when variation is west, MN is west of
TN (Figure 3.3). Lines connecting points having the same magnetic variation are called isogonic lines, as
shown in Figure 3.4. Compensate for magnetic variation to convert a compass direction to true direction.

Figure 3.3. Variation Is Angle Between True North and Magnetic North.




Figure 3.4. Isogonic Lines Show Same Magnetic Variation.




3.5.2.1. Compass error is caused by nearby magnetic influences, such as magnetic material in the
structure of the aircraft and its electrical systems. These magnetic forces deflect a compass needle from
its normal alignment. The amount of such deflection is called deviation which, like variation, is labeled
east or west as the north-seeking end of the compass is deflected east or west of MN, respectively.
88                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

3.5.2.2. The correction for variation and deviation is usually expressed as a plus or minus value and is
computed as a correction to true heading (TH). If variation or deviation is east, the sign of the correction
is minus; if west, the sign is plus. A rule of thumb for this correction is easily remembered as east is least
and west is best.

3.5.2.3. Aircraft headings are expressed as true headings or magnetic headings. If the heading is
measured in relation to geographical north, it is a TH. If the heading is in reference to MN, it is a
magnetic heading (MH); if it is in reference to the compass lubber line, it is a compass heading (CH).
CH corrected for variation and deviation is TH. MH corrected for variation is TH.

3.5.2.4. This relationship is best expressed by reference to the navigator's log, where the various
headings and corrections are listed as TH, variation (var), MH, deviation (dev), and CH. Thus, if an
aircraft is flying in an area where the variation is 10o E and the compass has a deviation of 3o E, the
relationship would be expressed as follows, assuming a CH of 125o (Figure 3.5):


              TH              var      MH         dev       CH

              138         -   10    = 128     -    3     = 125


Figure 3.5. To Find True Heading, Work Backwards.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                         89

3.5.3. Variation. Variation has been measured throughout the world and the values found have been
plotted on charts. Isogonic lines are printed on most charts used in aerial navigation so that, if the
aircraft's approximate position is known, the amount of variation can be determined by visual
interpolation between the printed lines. At high altitudes, these values can be considered quite realistic.
Conversely, at low altitudes, these magnetic values are less reliable because of local anomalies.
Variation changes slowly over a period of years and the yearly amount of such change is printed on most
charts. Variation is also subject to small diurnal (daily) changes which may generally be neglected in air
navigation.

3.5.4. Deviation. Because deviation depends upon the distribution of magnetic forces in the aircraft
itself, it must be obtained individually for each magnetic compass on each aircraft. The process of
determining deviation, known as compass swinging, should be discussed in the technical order for each
compass.

3.5.4.1. Deviation changes with heading (Figure 3.6). If the net result of all magnetic forces of the
aircraft (those forces excluding the earth's field) is represented by a dot located just behind the wings of
the aircraft. If the aircraft is headed toward MN, the dot attracts one pole of the magnetic compass (in
this case, the South Pole) but, on this heading, does not change its direction. The only effect is to amplify
the directive force of the earth's field. If the aircraft heads toward magnetic east, the dot is now west of
the compass, and attracts the South Pole of the compass, causing easterly deviation. The illustration in
Figure 3.6 also shows that the deviation is zero on a south heading, and westerly when the aircraft is
heading west.


Figure 3.6. Deviation Changes With Heading.




3.5.4.2. Deviation can be reduced (but not eliminated) in some direct-indicating magnetic compasses by
adjusting the small compensating magnets in the compass case. Remaining deviation is referred to as
residual deviation and can be determined by comparison with true values. This residual deviation is
90                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

recorded on a compass correction card showing actual deviation on various headings or the compass
headings as illustrated in Figure 3.7. From the compass correction card illustrated in Figure 3.7, the
navigator knows that to fly a magnetic heading (MH) of 270o, the pilot must steer a compass heading
(CH) of 268o.


Figure 3.7. Compass Correction Card.




3.5.5. Errors in Flight. Unfortunately, deviation is not the only error of a magnetic compass. Additional
errors are introduced by the motion of the aircraft itself. These errors have minimal effect on the use of
magnetic compasses and come into play normally during turns or changes in speed. They are mentioned
only to make you aware of the limitations of the basic compass. Although a basic magnetic compass has
some shortcomings, it is simple and reliable. The compass is very useful to both the pilot and navigator
and is carried on all aircraft as an auxiliary compass. Because compass systems are dependent upon the
electrical system of the aircraft, a loss of power means a loss of the compass system. For this reason, an
occasional check on the standby compass provides a excellent backup to the main systems.

3.5.6. Remote-Indicating Gyro-Stabilized Magnetic Compass System. A chief disadvantage of the
simple magnetic compass is its susceptibility to deviation. In remote-indicating gyro-stabilized compass
systems, this difficulty is overcome by locating the compass direction-sensing device outside magnetic
fields created by electrical circuits in the aircraft. This is done by installing the direction-sensing device
in a remote part of the aircraft, such as the outer extremity of a wing or vertical stabilizer. Indicators of
the compass system can then be located throughout the aircraft without regard to magnetic disturbances.

3.5.6.1. Several kinds of compass systems are used in Air Force aircraft. All include the following five
basic components: (1) remote compass transmitter, (2) directional gyro (DG), (3) amplifier, (4) heading
indicators, and (5) slaving control. Though the names of these components vary among systems, the
principle of operation is identical for each. Thus the N-1 compass system shown in Figure 3.8 can be
considered typical of all such systems.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        91

Figure 3.8. N-1 Compass System Components.




3.5.6.2. The N-1 compass system is designed for airborne use at all latitudes. It can be used either as a
magnetic-slaved compass or as a DG. In addition, the N-1 generates an electric signal which is used as
an azimuth reference by the autopilot, the radar system, the navigation and bombing computers, and
various compass cards.

3.5.7. Remote Compass Transmitter. The remote compass transmitter is the magnetic-direction-
sensing component of the compass system when the system is in operation as a magnetic-slaved
compass. The transmitter is located as far from magnetic disturbances of the aircraft as possible, usually
in a wing tip or the vertical stabilizer. The transmitter senses the horizontal component of the earth's
magnetic field and electrically transmits it to the master indicator. The compensator, an auxiliary unit of
the remote compass transmitter, is used to eliminate most of the magnetic deviation caused by the
aircraft electrical equipment and ferrous metal when a deviation-free location for the remote compass
transmitter is not available.

3.5.8. Directional Gyro (DG). The DG is the stabilizing component of the compass system when the
system is in magnetic-slaved operation. When the compass system is in DG operation, the gyro acts as
the directional reference component of the system.

3.5.9. Amplifier. The amplifier is the receiving and distributing center of the compass system. Azimuth
correction and leveling signals originating in the components of the system are each received, amplified,
and transmitted by separate channels in the amplifier. Primary power to operate the compass is fed to the
amplifier and distributed to the systems components.

3.5.10. Master Indicator. The master indicator is the heading-indicating component of the compass
system. The mechanism in the master indicator integrates all data received from the directional gyro and
the remote compass transmitter, corrects the master indicator heading pointer for azimuth drift of the DG
due to the earth's rotation, and provides takeoff signals for operating remote indicators, radar, navigation
computers, and directional control of the autopilot.
92                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

3.5.10.1. The latitude correction control provides a means for selecting either magnetic-slaved operation
or DG operation of the compass system as well as the proper latitude correction rate. The latitude
correction pointer is mechanically connected to the latitude correction control knob and indicates the
latitude setting on the latitude correction scale at the center of the master indicator dial face.

3.5.10.2. The synchronizer control knob at the lower right-hand corner of the master indicator face
provides a means of synchronizing the master indicator heading pointer with the correct MH when the
system is in magnetic-slaved operation. It also provides a means of setting the master indicator heading
pointer on the desired gyro heading reference when the system is in DG operation.

3.5.10.3. The annunciator pointer indicates the direction in which to rotate the synchronizer control knob
to align the heading pointer with the correct MH.

3.5.11. Gyro-Magnetic Compass Indicators. The gyro-magnetic compass indicators are remote-
reading, movable dial compass indicators. They are intended for supplementary use as directional
compass indicators when used with the compass system. The indicators duplicate the azimuth heading of
the master indicator heading pointer. A setting knob is provided at the front of each indicator for rotating
the dial 360o in either direction without changing the physical alignment of the pointer.

3.5.12. Slaving Control. The slaving control is a gyro control rate switch which reduces errors in the
compass system during turns. When the aircraft turns at a rate of 23o or more per minute, the slaving
control prevents the remote compass transmitter signal from being transmitted to the compass system
during magnetic-slaved operation. It also interrupts leveling action in the DG when the system is in
magnetic-slaved or DG operation.

3.6. The Gyro:

3.6.1. Basics. Any spinning body exhibits gyroscopic properties. A wheel designed and mounted to use
these properties is called a gyroscope or gyro. Basically, a gyro is a rapidly rotating mass which is free to
move about one or both axes perpendicular to the axis of rotation and to each other. The three axes of a
gyro (spin, drift, and topple) shown in Figure 3.9 are defined as follows: (1) In a DG, the spin axis or
axis of rotation is mounted horizontally; (2) The topple axis is that axis in the horizontal plane that is 90o
from the spin axis; (3) The drift axis is that axis 90o vertically from the spin axis.

Figure 3.9. Gyroscope Axes.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                           93

3.6.1.1. Gyroscopic drift is the horizontal rotation of the spin axis about the drift axis. Topple is the
vertical rotating of the spin axis about the topple axis. These two component drifts result in motion of
the gyro called precession.

3.6.1.2. A freely spinning gyro tends to maintain its axis in a constant direction in space, a property
known as rigidity in space or gyroscopic inertia. Thus, if the spin axis of a gyro were pointed toward a
star, it would keep pointing at the star. Actually, the gyro does not move, but the earth moving beneath it
gives it an apparent motion. This apparent motion, shown in Figure 3.10, is called apparent precession.
The magnitude of apparent precession is dependent upon latitude. The horizontal component, drift, is
equal to 15o per hour times the sine of the latitude, and the vertical component, topple, is equal to 15o per
hour times the cosine of the latitude.


Figure 3.10. Apparent Precession.




3.6.1.3. These computations assume the gyro is stationary with respect to the earth. If the gyro is to be
used in a high-speed aircraft, however, it is readily apparent that its speed with respect to a point in space
may be more or less than the speed of rotation of the earth. If the aircraft in which the gyro is mounted is
moving in the same direction as the earth, the speed of the gyro with respect to space will be greater than
the earth's speed. The opposite is true if the aircraft is flying in a direction opposite to that of the earth's
rotation. This difference in the magnitude of apparent precession caused by transporting the gyro over
the earth is called transport precession.

3.6.1.4. A gyro may precess because of factors other than the earth's rotation. When this occurs, the
precession is labeled real precession. When a force is applied to the plane of rotation of a gyro, the plane
tends to rotate, not in the direction of the applied force, but 90o around the spin axis from it. This
torquing action, shown in Figure 3.11, may be used to control the gyro by bringing about a desired
reorientation of the spin axis, and most DGs are equipped with some sort of device to introduce this
force. However, friction within the bearings of a gyro may have the same effect and cause a certain
94                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

amount of unwanted precession. Great care is taken in the manufacture and maintenance of gyroscopes
to eliminate this factor as much as possible, but, as yet, it has not been possible to eliminate it entirely.
Precession caused by the mechanical limitations of the gyro is called real or induced precession. The
combined effects of apparent precession, transport precession, and real precession produce the total
precession of the gyro.


Figure 3.11. Precession of Gyroscope Resulting From Applied Deflective Force.




3.6.1.5. The properties of the gyro that most concern the navigator are rigidity and precession. By
understanding these two properties, the navigator is well-equipped to use the gyro as a reliable steering
guide.

3.6.2. Directional Gyro (DG). The discussion thus far has been of a universally mounted gyro, free to
turn in the horizontal or vertical or any component of these two. This type of gyro is seldom, if ever,
used as a DG. When the gyro is used as a steering instrument, it is restricted so that the spin axis remains
parallel to the surface of the earth. Thus, the spin axis is free to turn only in the horizontal plane
(assuming the aircraft normally flies in a near-level attitude), and only the horizontal component (drift)
will affect a steering gyro. In the terminology of gyro steering, precession always means the horizontal
component of precession.

3.6.2.1. The operation of the instrument depends upon the principle of rigidity in space of the gyroscope.
Fixed to the plane of the spin axis is a circular compass card, similar to that of the magnetic compass.
Since the spin axis remains rigid in space, the points on the card hold the same position in space relative
to the horizontal plane. The case, to which the lubber line is attached, simply revolves about the card.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                         95

3.6.2.2. It is important at this point to understand that the numbers on the compass card have no meaning
within themselves, as on the magnetic compass. The fact that the gyro may indicate 100o under the
lubber line is not an indication that the instrument is actually oriented to magnetic north (MN), or any
other known point. To steer by the gyro, the navigator must first set it to a known direction or point.
Usually, this is MN or geographic north, though it can be at any known point. If, for example, MN is set
as the reference, all headings on the gyro read relative to the position of the magnetic poles.

3.6.2.3. The actual setting of the initial reference heading is done by using the principle discussed earlier
of torque application to the spinning gyro. By artificially introducing precession, the navigator can set
the gyro to whatever heading is desired and can reset it at any time, by using the same technique.

3.6.3. Gyrocompass Errors. The major error affecting the gyro and its use as a steering instrument is
precession. Apparent precession will cause an apparent change of heading equal to 15o per hour times
the sine of the latitude. Real precession, caused by defects in the gyro, may occur at any rate, but is
typically very small in current gyros. Apparent precession is a known value depending upon location and
can be compensated for. In some of the more complex gyro systems, apparent precession is compensated
for by setting in a constant correction equal to and in the opposite direction to the precession caused by
the earth's rotation.

Section 3Dâ€”Altitude and Altimeters

3.7. Basics. Altitude may be defined as a vertical distance above some point or plane used as a reference.
Knowledge of the aircraft altitude is imperative for terrain clearance, aircraft separation, and a multitude
of operational reasons. There are as many kinds of altitude as there are reference planes from which to
measure them. Only six concern the navigator: indicated altitude, calibrated altitude, pressure altitude
(PA), density altitude (DA), true altitude (TA), and absolute altitude. There are two main types of
altimeters; the pressure altimeter which is installed in every aircraft, and the absolute or radar altimeter.
To understand the pressure altimeter's principle of operation, a knowledge of the standard datum plane is
essential.

3.8. Standard Datum Plane. The standard datum plane is a theoretical plane where the atmospheric
pressure is 29.92 inches of mercury (Hg) and the temperature is 15 oC. The standard datum plane is the
zero elevation level of an imaginary atmosphere known as the standard atmosphere. In the standard
atmosphere, pressure is 29.92" Hg at 0 feet and decreases upward at the standard pressure lapse rate. The
temperature is 15 oC at 0 feet and decreases at the standard temperature lapse rate. Both the pressure and
temperature lapse rates are given in the table in Figure 3.12. The standard atmosphere is theoretical. It
was derived by averaging the readings taken over a period of many years. The list of altitudes and their
corresponding values of temperature and pressure given in the table were determined by these averages.
The height of the aircraft above the standard datum plane (29.92" Hg and 15 oC) is called pressure
altitude (PA) as illustrated in Figure 3.13.

Figure 3.13. Depiction of Altimetry Terms.




3.9. Pressure Altimeter Principles of Operation. The pressure altimeter is an aneroid barometer
calibrated to indicate feet of altitude instead of pressure. As shown in Figure 3.14, the pointers are
connected by a mechanical linkage to a set of aneroid cells. These aneroid cells expand or contract with
changes in barometric pressure. In this manner, the cells assume a particular thickness at a given
pressure level and, thereby, position the altitude pointers accordingly. On the face of the altimeter is a
barometric scale which indicates the barometric pressure (expressed in inches of mercury) of the point or
plane from which the instrument is measuring altitude. Turning the barometric pressure set knob on the
altimeter manually changes this altimeter setting on the barometric scale and results in simultaneous
movement of the altitude pointers to the corresponding altitude reading. Like all measurements, an
altitude reading is meaningless if the point from which it starts is unknown. The face of the pressure
altimeter supplies both values. The position of the pointers indicates the altitude in feet, and the
barometric pressure appearing on the barometric scale is that of the reference plane above which the
measurement is made.
98                                                                  AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

3.10. Altimeter Displays:

3.10.1. Counter-Pointer Altimeter. The counter-pointer altimeter has a two-counter digital display unit
located in the 9 o'clock position of the dial. The counter indicates altitude in 1,000-foot increments from
zero to 80,000 feet (Figure 3.15). A single conventional pointer indicates l00s of feet on the fixed
circular scale. It makes one complete revolution per 1,000 feet of altitude change and, as it passes
through the 900 to 1,000-foot area of the dial, the 1,000-foot counter is actuated. The shaft of the 1,000-
foot counter in turn actuates the 10,000-foot counter at each 10,000 feet of altitude change. To determine
the indicated altitude, first read the 1,000-foot counter and then add the 100-foot pointer indication.

CAUTION: It is possible to misinterpret the counter-pointer altimeter by 1,000 feet immediately before
or after the 1,000-foot counter moves. This error is possible because the 1,000-foot counter changes
when the 100-foot pointer is between the 900- and 1,000-foot position.

3.10.2. Counter-Drum-Pointer Altimeter. Aside from the familiar circular scale and 100-foot pointer
the counter-drum-pointer presentation differs somewhat in appearance from the present three-pointer
altimeter. Starting at the left of the instrument illustrated in Figure 3.16 and reading from left to right,
there are two counter windows and one drum window (white). The numerals presented in the counter
windows indicate 10,000s and 1,000s of feet, respectively. The drum window numbers always follow the
pointer number, thereby indicating 100s of feet.

3.10.2.1. Two methods may be used to read indicated pressure altitude on the counter-drum-pointer
altimeter: (1) read the counter-drum window, without referring to the 100-foot pointer, as a direct digital
readout of both thousands and hundreds of feet; (2) read the two counter indications, without referring to
the drum, and then add the 100-foot pointer indication. The 100-foot pointer serves as a precise readout
of values less than 100 feet.

3.10.2.2. The differential air pressure which is used to operate the counter-drum-pointer altimeter is
processed by an altitude transducer where it is converted to electrical signals that drive the indicator. The
transducer is also used to send digital signals to a transponder for purposes of automatic altitude
reporting to Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC). A standby system is available for use if an
electrical malfunction occurs. In the standby system, the altimeter receives static air pressure directly
from the pitot-static system. When the instrument is operating in the standby system, the word
STANDBY appears on the instrument face. A switch in the upper right-hand corner of the instrument is
provided to return the instrument to its normal mode of operation. This switch may also be used to
manually place the instrument in the STANDBY mode.

3.11. Altimeter Errors. The pressure altimeter is subject to certain errors which fall in five general
categories.

3.11.1. Mechanical Error. Mechanical error is caused by misalignment of gears and levers which
transmit the aneroid cell expansion and contraction to the pointers of the altimeter. This error is not
constant and must be checked before each flight by the setting procedure.

3.11.2. Scale Error. Scale error is caused by irregular expansion of the aneroid cells and is recorded on
a scale correction card maintained for each altimeter in the instrument maintenance shop.

3.11.3. Installation or Position Error. An installation or position error is caused by the airflow around
the static ports. This error varies with the type of aircraft, airspeed, and altitude. The magnitude and
direction of this error can be determined by referring to the performance data section in the aircraft
technical order. An altimeter correction card is installed in some aircraft which combines the installation
or position and scale errors. The card indicates the amount of correction required at different altitudes
and airspeeds.

WARNING: Installation or position error may be considerable at high speeds and altitudes. Apply the
corrections as outlined in the technical order or on the altimeter correction card.

3.11.4. Reversal Error. Reversal error is caused by inducing false static pressure in the static system. It
normally occurs during abrupt or large pitch changes. This error appears on the altimeter as a momentary
indication in the opposite direction.

3.11.5. Hysteresis Error. Hysteresis error is a lag in altitude indication caused by the elastic properties
of the material within the altimeter. This occurs after an aircraft has maintained a constant altitude for an
extended period of time and then makes a large, rapid altitude change. After a rapid descent, altimeter
indications are higher than actual. This error is negligible during climbs and descents at slow rate or after
maintaining a new altitude for a short period of time.

3.11.6. Setting the Altimeter. The barometric scale is used to set a reference plane into the altimeter.
Rotating the barometric pressure set knob increases or decreases the scale reading and the indicated
altitude. Each .01 change on the barometric scale is equal to 10 feet of altitude. The majority of
altimeters have mechanical stops at or just beyond the barometric scale limits (28.10 to 31.00).
Attempting to adjust outside this range may cause damage to the instrument. NOTE: Altimeters not
equipped with mechanical stops near the barometric scale limits can be set with a 10,000-foot error.
Therefore, when setting the altimeter, ensure the 10,000-foot pointer is reading correctly. Check the
altimeter for accuracy before every flight. To check and set the altimeter:

3.11.6.1. Set the current altimeter setting on the barometric scale.

3.11.6.2. Check altimeter at a known elevation and note the error in feet.

3.11.6.3. Set the reported altimeter setting on the barometric scale and compare the indicated altitude to
the elevation of a known checkpoint.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        101

3.12. Nonstandard Atmospheric Effects. The altimeter setting is a correction for nonstandard surface
pressure only. Atmospheric pressure is measured at each station and the value obtained is corrected to
sea level according to the surveyed field elevation. Thus, the altimeter setting is the computed sea level
pressure and should be considered valid only in close proximity to the station and the surface. It does not
reflect nonstandard temperature nor distortion of atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes.

3.13. Types of Altitude:

3.13.1. Indicated Altitude. This is the value of altitude that is displayed on the pressure altimeter.

3.13.2. Calibrated Altitude. Calibrated altitude is indicated altitude corrected for installation or position
error.

3.13.3. Pressure Altitude (PA). The height above the standard datum plane (29.92" Hg and 15 oC) is
PA (Figure 3.13.)

3.13.4. Density Altitude (DA). Density is mass per unit volume. The density of the air varies with
temperature and with height. Warm air expands and is less dense than cold air. Normally, the higher the
PA, the less dense the air becomes. The density of the air can be expressed in terms of the standard
atmosphere. DA is the PA corrected for temperature in the density altitude window of the dead
reckoning (DR) computer. This calculation converts the density of the air to the standard atmospheric
altitude having the same density. DA is used in performance data and true airspeed (TAS) calculations.

3.13.5. True Altitude (TA). TA is the actual vertical distance above mean sea level (MSL), measured in
feet. It can be determined by two methods:

3.13.5.1. Set the local altimeter setting on the barometric scale of the pressure altimeter to obtain the
indicated true altitude (ITA). The ITA can then be resolved to TA by use of the DR computer (Figure
3.17).

3.13.5.2. Measure altitude over water with an absolute altimeter.

3.13.6. Absolute Altitude. The height above the terrain is called absolute altitude. It is computed by
subtracting terrain elevation from TA, or it can be read directly from a radar altimeter.

3.14. Computer Altitude Solutions. The two altitudes most commonly accomplished on the computer
are TA and DA. Nearly all DR computers have a window by which DA can be determined; however, be
certain that the window is labeled density altitude.

3.14.1. True Altitude (TA) Determination. In the space marked FOR ALTITUDE COMPUTATIONS
are two scales: (1) a centigrade scale in the window and (2) a pressure altitude (PA) scale on the upper
disk. When a PA is placed opposite the temperature at that height, all values on the outer (miles) scale
are equal to the corresponding values on the inner (minutes) scale increased or decreased by 2 percent
for each 5.5 oC that the actual temperature differs from the standard temperature at that PA, as set in the
window. Although the PA is set in the window, the ITA is used on the inner (minutes) scale for finding
the TA, corrected for difference in temperature lapse rate.

EXAMPLE:
        Given: PA 8,500 feet
        Given: ITA 8,000 feet
        Given: Air Temperature â€“16 oC
        To Find: TA

Procedure: Place PA (8,500 feet) opposite the temperature (-16) on the FOR ALTITUDE
COMPUTATIONS scale. Opposite the ITA (8,000 feet) on the inner scale, read the TA (7,600 feet) on
the outer scale. The solution is illustrated in Figure 3.l7.

Figure 3.17. Finding True Altitude.




3.14.2. Density Altitude (DA) Determination. DA determination on the computer is accomplished by
using the window just above FOR AIRSPEED AND DENSITY ALTITUDE COMPUTATIONS and the
small window just above that marked DENSITY ALTITUDE.

EXAMPLE:
         Given: PA 9,000 feet
         Given: Air temperature 10o C
         To Find: DA

Procedure: Place pressure altitude (9,000 feet) opposite air temperature (10) in window marked FOR
AIRSPEED AND DENSITY ALTITUDE, read DA (10,400 feet). The solution is illustrated in Figure
3.18.

Section 3Eâ€”Absolute Altimeter

3.15. Basics. Accurate absolute altitude is an important requisite for navigation, airdrop, and bombing as
well as for safe aviating. It is particularly important in pressure pattern navigation. Absolute altitude may
be computed from the PA readings if the position of the aircraft is known, but the results are often
inaccurate. Under changing atmospheric conditions, corrections applied to PA readings to obtain TAs
are only approximate. In addition, any error made in determining the terrain elevations results in a
corresponding error in the absolute altitude.

3.16. Radar Altimeter (High-Level). A typical high-level radar altimeter is designed to indicate
absolute altitude of the aircraft up to 50,000 feet above the terrain, land, or water. This altimeter does not
warn of approaching obstructions, such as mountains, because it measures altitude only to a point
directly below the aircraft (Figure 3.19).


Figure 3.19. Typical High-Level Radar Altimeter.




3.16.1. A typical set consists of the radar receiver-transmitter, height indicator, and antenna. The
transmitter section of the receiver-transmitter unit develops recurring pulses of radio frequency (RF)
energy which are delivered to the transmitter antenna located either flush-mounted or on the underside of
the aircraft. The transmitter antenna radiates the pulsed energy downward to reflect off the earth and
return to the receiver antenna on the aircraft. The time consumed between transmission and reception of
the RF pulse is determined only by the absolute altitude of the aircraft above the terrain since the radio
wave velocity is constant.

3.16.2. The receiver antenna delivers the returned pulse to the receiver section of the receiver-transmitter
unit where it is amplified and detected for presentation on the indicator unit. The radar altimeter
indicator displays absolute altitude which is used in pressure pattern navigation, terrain clearance, or as a
backup for the PA.
104                                                                 AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

3.17. Radar Altimeter (Low-Level). This type altimeter provides a dial or digital indication of the
altitude of the aircraft above the terrain. It is designed to eliminate the necessity of adding antennas or
any other equipment external to the surface of the aircraft. This equipment may also be used in
conjunction with automatic pilot or other devices requiring altitude limit data.

3.17.1. Systems vary widely, but typically include a receiver-transmitter, height indicator, and electronic
control amplifier. The height indicator contains the only operating control on the equipment. This
instrument normally gives altitude readings up to 35,000 feet. If the instrument has an analog scale, the
markings are usually logarithmic, graduated for the low altitude portion of its range. A variable altitude
limit indicator system is included to provide an indication of flight below a preset altitude.

3.17.2. To operate the equipment, turn the ON-LIMIT control to ON. After warmup, the terrain
clearance of the aircraft within the range of 0â€“20,000 is read directly from the single pointer on the
indicator as shown in Figure 3.20. This pointer can be preset to any desired altitude by the ON-LIMIT
control and is used as a reference for flying at fixed altitudes. The altitude can be maintained by
observing the position of the pointer with respect to the small triangular marker instead of the actual
altitude scale. In addition, a red light on the front of the indicator lights up when the aircraft is at or
below the preset altitude. To turn off the equipment, it is only necessary to turn off the ON-LIMIT
control on the indicator.


Figure 3.20. Low-Level Radar Altimeter.




Section 3Fâ€”Temperature

3.18. Basics. Determination of correct temperature is necessary for accurate computation of airspeed and
altitude. Temperature, airspeed, and altitude are all closely interrelated, and the navigator must be
familiar with each in order to work effectively and accurately.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                          105

3.19. Temperature Gauges. The temperature gauge most commonly used in the Air Force employs a
bimetallic element. The instrument is a single unit consisting of a stainless steel stem which projects into
the airstream and a head which contains the pointer and scale. The sensitive element in the outside end
of the stem is covered by a radiation shield of brightly polished metal to cut down the amount of heat
that the element might absorb by direct radiation from the sun. The bimetallic element (called the
sensitive element) is so named because it consists of two strips of different metal alloys welded together.
When the element is heated, one alloy expands more rapidly than the other causing this element, which
is shaped like a coil spring, to turn. This, in turn, causes the indicator needle to move on the pointer dial.
Temperatures between â€“60 oC and 50 oC can be measured on this type of gauge.

3.20. Temperature Scales. In the United States, temperature is usually expressed in terms of the
Fahrenheit scale (oF). In aviation, temperature is customarily measured on the centigrade, or Celsius
(oC), scale.

3.20.1. Although aircraft thermometers are usually calibrated in oC, it is sometimes necessary to
interconvert Fahrenheit and centigrade temperatures. The following formulas may be used:
         o
          F = (1.8 X oC) + 32o
         o
          C = (oF - 32o) / 1.8

3.20.2. Temperature error is the total effect of scale error and heat of compression error. Scale error is
simply an erroneous reading of the pointer under standard conditions. It is difficult for a crewmember to
evaluate this error without sensitive testing equipment. With this in mind, the reading of the indicator is
considered correct and is called indicated air temperature (IAT).

3.20.3. The second error, heat of compression error, causes the instrument to read too warm. Heating
occurs at high speeds from friction and the compression of air on the forward edge of the temperature
probe. Thus, the IAT is always corrected by a minus correction factor to produce true air temperature
(TAT). Heat of compression increases with TAS. The TAT can be obtained from the aircraft flight
manual.

Section 3Gâ€”Airspeed

3.21. Basics. Airspeed is the speed of the aircraft in relation to the airmass surrounding that aircraft.

3.22. Pitot-Static System. Accurate airspeed measurement is obtained by means of a pitot-static system.
The system consists of: (1) a tube mounted parallel to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft in an area that
is free of turbulent air generated by the aircraft, and (2) a static source that provides still, or undisturbed,
air pressure.

3.22.1. Ram and static pressures may be taken from a single pitot-static tube or from completely separate
sources. A pitot-static tube usually has a baffle plate, as shown in Figure 3.21, to reduce turbulence and
to prevent rain, ice, and dirt from entering the tube. There may be one or more drain holes in the bottom
of the tube to dispose of condensed moisture. A built-in electrical heating element, controlled by a
switch inside the aircraft, prevents the formation of ice in the tube.
106                                                                 AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

3.22.2. Reasonable care should be taken with the pitot-static system to ensure continuous, reliable
service. The drain holes should be checked periodically to ensure they are not clogged. At the
completion of each flight, a cover is placed over the intake end of the tube to prevent foreign objects and
moisture from collecting in the tube.

Figure 3.21. Operating Principle of the Airspeed Indicator.




3.23. Principles of Operation of Airspeed Indicators. The heart of the airspeed indicator is a
diaphragm which is sensitive to pressure changes. Figure 3.21 shows it located inside the indicator case
and connected to the ram air source in the pitot tube. The indicator case is sealed airtight and connected
to the static pressure source. The differential pressure created by the relative effects of the impact and
static pressures on the diaphragm causes it to expand or contract. As the speed of the aircraft increases,
the impact pressure increases, causing the diaphragm to expand. Through mechanical linkage, the
expansion is displayed as an increase in airspeed. This principle is used in the IAS meter, the TAS meter,
and the Machmeter.

3.24. Airspeed Definitions. There are many reasons for the difference between IAS and TAS. Some of
the reasons are the error in the mechanical makeup of the instrument, the error caused by incorrect
installation, and the fact that density and pressure of the atmosphere vary from standard conditions.

3.24.1. Indicated Airspeed (IAS). IAS is the uncorrected reading taken from the face of the indicator. It
is the airspeed that the instrument shows on the dial.

3.24.2. Basic Airspeed (BAS). BAS is the IAS corrected for instrument error. Each airspeed indicator
has its own characteristics which cause it to differ from any other airspeed indicator. These differences
may be caused by slightly different hairspring tensions, flexibility of the diaphragm, accuracy of the
scale markings, or even the effect of temperature on the different metals in the indicator mechanism. The
effect of temperature introduces an instrument error due to the variance in the coefficient of expansion of
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        107

the different metals comprising the working mechanisms. This error can be removed by the installation
of a bimetallic compensator within the mechanical linkage. This bimetallic compensator is installed and
properly set at the factory, thereby eliminating the temperature error within the instrument. The accuracy
of the airspeed indicator is also affected by the length and curvature of the pressure line from the pitot
tube. These installation errors must be corrected mathematically. Installation, scale, and instrument
errors are all combined under one title called instrument error. Instrument error is factory-determined to
be within specified tolerances for various airspeeds. It is considered negligible or is accounted for in
technical order tables and graphs.

3.24.3. Calibrated Airspeed (CAS). CAS is basic airspeed corrected for pitot-static error or attitude of
the aircraft. The pitot-static system of a moving aircraft will have some error. Minor errors will be found
in the pitot section of the system. The major difficulty is encountered in the static pressure section. As
the flight attitude of the aircraft changes, the pressure at the static inlets changes. This is caused by the
airstream striking the inlet at an angle. Different types and locations of installations cause different
errors. It is immaterial whether the status source is located in the pitot-static head or at some flush
mounting on the aircraft. This error will be essentially the same for all aircraft of the same model, and a
correction can be computed by referring to tables in the appendix of the flight manual.

3.24.4. Equivalent Airspeed (EAS). EAS is CAS corrected for compressibility. Compressibility
becomes noticeable when the airspeed is great enough to create an impact pressure which causes the air
molecules to be compressed within the impact chamber of the pitot tube. The amount of the compression
is directly proportionate to the impact pressure. As the air is compressed, it causes the dynamic pressure
to be greater than it should be. Therefore, the correction is a negative value. The correction for
compressibility error can be determined by referring to the performance data section of the aircraft flight
manual or by using the F-correction factor on the DR computer.

3.24.5. Density Airspeed (DAS). DAS is calibrated airspeed corrected for pressure altitude (PA) and
true air temperature (TAT). Pitot pressure varies not only with airspeed but also with air density. As the
density of the atmosphere decreases with height, pitot pressure for a given airspeed must also decrease
with height. Thus, an airspeed indicator operating in a less dense medium than that for which it was
calibrated will indicate an airspeed lower than true speed. The higher the aircraft flies, the greater the
discrepancy. The necessary correction can be found on the DR computer. Using the window on the
computer above the area marked FOR AIRSPEED DENSITY ALTITUDE COMPUTATIONS, set the
PA against the TAT. Opposite the CAS on the minutes scale, read the DAS on the miles scale. At lower
airspeeds and altitudes, DAS may be taken as true airspeed with negligible error. However, at high
speeds and altitudes, this is no longer true and compressibility error must be considered.
(Compressibility error is explained in the equivalent airspeed section.) When density altitude (DA) is
multiplied by the compressibility factor, the result is true airspeed.

3.24.6. True Airspeed (TAS). TAS is equivalent airspeed that has been corrected for air density error.
By correcting EAS for TAT and PA, the navigator compensates for air density error and computes an
accurate value of TAS. The TAS increases with altitude when the IAS remains constant. When the TAS
remains constant, the IAS decreases with altitude. CAS and EAS can be determined by referring to the
performance data section of the aircraft flight manual.

3.25. Computing True Airspeed:
108                                                                 AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

3.25.1. ICE-T Method. To compute TAS using the ICE-T method on the DR computer, solve, for each
type of airspeed, in the order of I, C, E, and T; that is, change IAS to CAS, change CAS to EAS, and
change EAS to TAS. This process is illustrated by the following sample problem. (Refer to definitions as
necessary.)

           Given: PA: 30.000'
           Given: Temperature: -37 oC
           Given: IAS: 253 knots
           Given: Flight Manual Correction Factor: 2 knots
           Find: CAS
           Find: EAS
           Find: TAS

Answer: CAS is determined by algebraically adding to IAS the correction factor taken from the chart in
your flight manual. (This correction is insignificant at low speeds but can be higher than 10 knots near
Mach 1.)

3.25.1.1. To correct CAS to EAS, use the chart on the slide of the computer entitled F-CORRECTION
FACTORS FOR TAS. See Figure 3.22. Enter the chart with CAS and PA. The F factor is .96. This
means we multiply CAS by .96 or take 96 percent of 255 knots. To do this, place 255 knots on the inner
scale under the 10 index on the outer scale. Locate 96 on the outer scale and read EAS on the inner scale:
245 knots.

3.25.1.2. Now, we need to correct EAS for temperature and altitude to get TAS. As shown in Figure
3.22, in the window marked FOR AIRSPEED AND DENSITY ALTITUDE COMPUTATIONS, place
temperature over PA. Locate the EAS of 245 knots on the inner scale and read TAS on the outer scale.
The TAS is 408 knots.

3.25.2. Alternate TAS Method. There is an alternate method of finding TAS when given CAS. The
instructions for alternate solution are printed on the computer directly below the F factor table (Multiply
F Factor by TAS obtained with computer to obtain TAS corrected for compressibility). Mathematically,
your answer should be the same regardless of the procedure you use, but the ICE-T method is used most
often because the computation can be worked backwards from TAS. If you wish to maintain a constant
TAS, you can determine what IAS to fly by working the ICE-T method in reverse (also known as
Reverse ICE-T), as illustrated in Figure 3.23.

3.26. Machmeters. Machmeters indicate the ratio of aircraft speed to the speed of sound at any
particular altitude and temperature during flight. It is often necessary to convert TAS to a Mach number
or vice versa. Instructions are clearly written on the computer in the center portion of the circular slide
rule. Locate the window marked FOR AIRSPEED AND DENSITY ALTITUDE COMPUTATIONS and
rotate the disk until the window points to the top of the computer (toward the l0 index on the outer
scale). Within the window is an arrow entitled MACH NO. INDEX (Figure 3.24). To obtain TAS from a
given Mach number, set air temperature over the MACH NO. INDEX and, opposite the Mach number
on the MINUTES scale, read the TAS on the outer scale.
AFPAM11-216         1 MARCH 2001                                                                109

EXAMPLE: If you are planning to maintain Mach 1.2 on a cross-country flight, place the air
temperature at flight altitude over the MACH NO. INDEX. Read the TAS on the outer scale opposite 1.2
on the inner scale. If the temperature is â€“20 oC, the TAS will be 742 knots.

3.27. Airspeed Indicators. The combined airspeed-Mach indicator, shown in Figure 3.25, is usually
found in high-performance aircraft or where instrument panel space is limited. It simultaneously displays
IAS, indicated Mach number, and maximum allowable airspeed. It contains a differential pressure
diaphragm and two aneroid cells. The diaphragm drives the airspeed-Mach pointer. One aneroid cell
rotates the Mach scale, permitting IAS and Mach number to be read simultaneously. The second aneroid
cell drives the maximum allowable airspeed pointer. This pointer is preset to the aircraft's maximum
IAS. Unlike the maximum IAS and unlike the maximum allowable airspeed, Mach number increases
with altitude. An airspeed marker set knob positions a movable airspeed marker. This marker serves as a
memory reference for desired airspeed.

3.28. Air Data Computer. The air data computer is an electro-pneumatic unit that uses pitot and static
pressures and total air temperature to compute outputs for various systems. These output parameters of
voltage and resistance represent functions of altitude, Mach number, TAS, computed airspeed, and static
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     111

air temperature. Air data computer outputs are used with the flight director computers, automatic flight
controls, cabin pressurization equipment, and normal basic indicators. The air data computer provides
extreme accuracy and increased reliability.

3.29. Doppler. Doppler radar provides the navigator with continuous, instantaneous, and accurate
readings of groundspeed (GS) and drift angle in all weather conditions, both over land and water. It does
this automatically with equipment that is of practical size and weight. Its operation makes use of the
Doppler effect.

3.29.1. Two basic Doppler radar systems existâ€”the four-beam and the three-beam. Both types use either
continuous wave (CW) or pulse wave (PW) transmission. CW transmission requires one antenna for
transmission and a second antenna for reception. Both use an X-shaped beam configuration.
Groundspeed is computed by comparing Doppler shift between front and rear beams, and drift angle is
computed by comparing the shift between the left and right beams.

3.29.2. Doppler is not the only source of drift angle and GS. The same basic information is available on
virtually all Inertial Navigation Systems, and now Global Positioning System computers can also give
accurate information under a wider range of conditions.

3.30. Summary. While the operation of some of the equipment in this chapter seems crude and
primitive compared to state-of-the-art navigation computers currently in use, these instruments still have
two very important usesâ€”they act as crosschecks to ensure the computers are functioning properly, and
they become your primary means of navigation when the computers aren't.

                                      DEAD RECKONING (DR)

Section 4Aâ€”Basic Navigation

4.1. Dead Reckoning (DR). Having discussed the basic instruments available to the navigator, we will
now review the mechanics of DR procedures, plotting, determining wind effect, and MB-4 computer
solutions. Using basic skills in DR procedures, a navigator can predict aircraft positions in the event
more reliable navigation equipment is unavailable or not operative. Therefore, a good foundation in DR
is imperative for the navigator.

4.2. Plotting. Chart work should be an accurate and graphic picture of the progress of the aircraft from
departure to destination and, with the log, should serve as a complete record of the flight. Thus, it also
follows that the navigator must be familiar with and use accepted standard symbols and labels on charts
as shown in Figure 4.1. (See Attachment 3 for additional chart and navigation symbols.)


Figure 4.1. Standard Plotting Symbols.




4.3. Terms Explained. Several terms have been mentioned in earlier portions of this pamphlet. Precise
definitions of these terms must now be understood before the mechanics of chart work are learned.

4.3.1. True Course (TC). The intended horizontal direction of travel over the surface of the earth,
expressed as an angle measured clockwise from true north (000o) through 360o.

4.3.2. Course Line. The horizontal component of the intended path of the aircraft comprising both
direction and magnitude or distance.

4.3.3. Track. The horizontal component of the actual path of the aircraft over the surface of the earth
Track may, but very seldom does, coincide with the TC or intended path of the aircraft. The difference
between the two is caused by an inability to predict perfectly all in-flight conditions.

4.3.4. True Heading (TH). The horizontal direction in which an aircraft is pointed. More precisely, it is
the angle measured clockwise from true north through 360o to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. The
difference between track and TH is caused by wind and is called drift.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       113

4.3.5. Groundspeed (GS). The speed of the aircraft over the ground. It may be expressed in nautical
miles (NM), statute miles, or kilometers (km) per hour, but, as a navigator, you will use NM per hour
(knots).

4.3.6. True Airspeed (TAS). The rate of motion of an aircraft relative to the airmass surrounding it.
Since the airmass is usually in motion in relation to the ground, airspeed and GS seldom are the same.

4.3.7. Dead Reckoning Position (DR Position). A point in relation to the earth established by keeping
an accurate account of time, GS, and track since the last known position. It may also be defined as the
position obtained by applying wind effect to the TH and TAS of the aircraft.

4.3.8. Fix. A position determined from terrestrial, electronic, or astronomical data.

4.3.9. Air Position (AP). The location of the aircraft in relation to the airmass surrounding it. TH and
TAS are the components of the vector used to establish an AP.

4.3.10. Most Probable Position (MPP). A position determined with partial reference to a DR position
and partial reference to a fixing aid.

4.4. Plotting Equipment. A fine-tipped pencil, a good pair of dividers, and a plotter are imperative for
accurate chart work.

4.4.1. Dividers. Dividers should be manipulated with one hand, leaving the other free to use the plotter,
pencil, or chart as necessary. Some navigation dividers have a tension screw which you can adjust to
prevent the dividers from becoming either too stiff or too loose for convenient use. Adjust the points of
the dividers to approximately equal length. A small screwdriver, required for these adjustments, should
be a part of the navigator's equipment.

4.4.2. Plotter. A common plotter is shown in Figure 4.2. This plotter is a semicircular protractor with a
straight edge attached to it. A small hole at the base of the protractor portion indicates the center of the
arc of the angular scale. Two complete scales cover the outer edge of the protractor and are graduated in
degrees. An abbreviated inner scale measures the angle from the vertical (Figures 4.3 and 4.4). The
angle measured is the angle between the meridian and the straight line. The outer scale is used to read all
angles between north through east to south, and the inner scale is used to read all angles between south
through west to north.

4.5. Plotting Procedures for Mercator Charts:

4.5.1. Preparation. Many charts and plotting sheets are printed on the Mercator projection. Before
starting any plot, note the scale and projection of the chart and check the date to make sure that it is the
latest edition. The latitude scale is used to represent NM. The longitude scale should never be used to
measure distance. Some charts carry a linear scale in the margin, and, where present, it indicates that the
same scale may be used anywhere on the chart.

Figure 4.4. Measuring True Course Near 180o or 360o.




4.5.2. Plotting Positions. On most Mercator charts, the spacing between meridians and parallels is
widely spaced, necessitating the use of dividers. There are several methods by which positions can be
plotted on Mercator charts. One method is illustrated in Figure 4.5. Place the straight edge of the plotter
in a vertical position at the desired longitude. Set the dividers to the desired number of minutes of
latitude. Hold one point against the straight edge on the parallel of latitude corresponding to the whole
degree of latitude given. Let the other point also rest against the straight edge and lightly prick the chart.
This marks the desired position. In measuring the latitude and longitude of a position already plotted,
reverse the procedure.

4.5.3. Plotting and Measuring Courses:

4.5.3.1. Step 1â€”Plot departure and destination on the chart as shown in Figure 4.6.

4.5.3.2. Step 2â€”Draw the course line between the two points. If they are close together, the straight
edge of the plotter can be used. If they are far apart, two plotters can be used together or a longer straight
edge can be used. If none of these methods is adequate, fold the edge of the charts so that the fold
connects the departure and destination points, and make a series of pencil marks along the edge. A
plotter or straight edge can then be used to connect the points where the chart is unfolded. After the
course line has been plotted, the next step is to determine its direction.
116                                                               AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

Figure 4.5. Plotting Positions on a Mercator.




Figure 4.6. Reading Direction of a Course Line.




4.5.3.3. Step 3â€”Place the points of the dividers or a pencil anywhere along the line to be measured.

4.5.34. Step 4â€”Place the plotter against the dividers.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     117

4.5.3.5. Step 5â€”Slide the plotter until the center hole is over the midmeridian. Make a mental estimate
of the approximate direction to avoid obtaining a reciprocal course.

4.5.3.6. Step 6â€”Read TC on the protractor at the meridian. Using the midmeridian will give an average
TC for the leg.

4.5.4. Plotting Course From Given Position. A course from a given position can be plotted quickly in
the following manner: Place the point of a pencil on the position and slide the plotter along this point,
rotating it as necessary, until the center hole and the figure on the protractor representing the desired
direction are lined up with the same meridian. Hold the plotter in place and draw the line along the
straight edge (Figure 4.7).


Figure 4.7. Plotting Course From Given Position.




4.5.5. Measuring Distance. One of the disadvantages of the Mercator chart is the lack of a constant
scale. If the two points between which the distance is to be measured are approximately in a north-south
direction and the total distance between them can be spanned, the distance can be measured on the
latitude scale opposite the midpoint. However, the total distance between any two points that do not lie
approximately north or south of each other should not be spanned unless the distance is short.

4.5.5.1. In the measurement of long distances, select a midlatitude lying approximately halfway between
the latitudes of the two points. By using dividers set to a convenient, reasonably short distance, such as
60 NM picked off at the midlatitude scale, you may determine an approximate distance by marking off
units along the line to be measured, as shown in Figure 4.8.
118                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 4.8. Midlatitude Scale.




4.5.5.2. The scale at the midlatitude is accurate enough if the course line does not cover more than 5o of
latitude (somewhat less in high latitudes). If the course line exceeds this amount or if it crosses the
equator, divide it into two or more legs and measure the length of each leg with the scale of its own
midlatitude.

4.6. Plotting Procedures for Lambert Conformal and Gnomonic Charts:

4.6.1. Plotting Positions. On a Lambert conformal chart the meridians are not parallel as on a Mercator
chart. Therefore, plotting a position by the method described under Mercator charts may not be accurate.
On small scale charts or where there is marked convergence, the plotter should intersect two graduated
parallels of latitude at the desired longitude rather than parallel to the meridian. Then, mark off the
desired latitude with your dividers. On a large scale chart, the meridians are so nearly parallel that this
precaution is unnecessary. The scale on all parts of a Lambert conformal chart is essentially constant.
Therefore, it is not absolutely necessary to pick off minutes of latitude near any particular parallel except
in the most precise work.

4.6.2. Plotting and Measuring Courses. Any straight line plotted on a Lambert conformal chart is
approximately an arc of a great circle. On long distance flights, this feature is advantageous since the
great circle course line can be plotted as easily as a rhumb line on a Mercator chart.

4.6.2.1. However, for shorter distances where the difference between the great circle and rhumb line is
negligible, the rhumb line is more desirable because a constant heading can be held. For such distances,
the approximate direction of the rhumb line course can be found by measuring the great circle course at
midmeridian as shown in Figure 4.9. In this case, the track is not quite the same as that indicated by the
course line drawn on the chart, since the actual track (a rhumb line) appears as a curve convex to the
equator on a Lambert conformal chart, while the course line (approximately a great circle) appears as a
straight line. Near midmeridian, the two have approximately the same direction (except for very long
distances) along an oblique course line as indicated in Figure 4.10.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                         119

Figure 4.9. Use Midmeridian to Measure Course on a Lambert Conformal.




Figure 4.10. At Midmeridian, R/L and G/Circle Have Approximately the Same Direction.




4.6.2.2. For long distances involving great circle courses, it is not possible to change heading
continually, as is necessary when following a great circle exactly, and it is customary to divide the great
circle into a series of legs, each covering about 5o of longitude. The direction of the rhumb line
connecting the ends of each leg is found at its midmeridian.

4.6.3. Measuring Distance. As previously stated, the scale on a Lambert conformal chart is practically
constant, making it possible to use any part of a meridian graduated in minutes of latitude to measure
NM.

4.6.4. Plotting on a Gnomonic Chart. Gnomonic charts are used mainly for planning great circle
routes. Since any straight line on a gnomonic chart is an arc of a great circle, a straight line drawn from
the point of departure to destination will give a great circle route. Once obtained, this great circle route is
transferred to a Mercator chart by breaking the route into segments as shown in Figure 4.11.

4.6.5. Plotting Hints. The following suggestions should prove helpful in developing good plotting
procedures:
120                                                                  AFPAM11-216         1 MARCH 2001

Figure 4.11. Transferring Great Circle Route From Gnomonic to Mercator Chart.




4.6.5.1. Measure all directions and distances carefully. Double-check all measurements, computations,
and positions.

4.6.5.2. Avoid plotting unnecessary lines. If a line serves no purpose, erase it.

4.6.5.3. Keep plotting equipment in good working order. If the plotter is broken, replace it. Keep sharp
points on dividers. Use a sharp pencil and an eraser that will not smudge.

4.6.5.4. Draw light lines at first, as they may have to be erased. When the line has been checked and
proven to be correct, then darken it if desired.

4.6.5.5. Label lines and points immediately after they are drawn. Use standard labels and symbols.
Letter the labels legibly. Be neat and exact.

Section 4Bâ€”DR Computer

4.7. Basics. Almost any type of navigation requires the solution of simple arithmetical problems
involving time, speed, distance, fuel consumption, and so forth. In addition, the effect of the wind on the
aircraft must be known; therefore, the wind must be computed. To solve such problems quickly and with
reasonable accuracy, various types of computers have been devised. The computer described in this
pamphlet is simply a combination of two devices: (1) a circular slide rule for the solution of arithmetical
problems (Figure 4.12), and (2) a specially designed instrument for the graphical solution of the wind
problem (Figure 4.13).

4.7.1. The slide rule is a standard device for the mechanical solution of various arithmetical problems.
Slide rules operate on the basis of logarithms. Slide rules are either straight or circular; the one on the
DR computer is circular.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      121

4.7.2. The slide rule face of the computer consists of two flat metallic disks, one of which can be rotated
around a common center. These disks are graduated near their edges with adjacent logarithmic scales to
form a circular slide rule approximately equivalent to a straight, 12-inch slide rule. Because the outer
scale usually represents a number of miles and the inner scale represents a number of minutes, they are
called the miles scale and the minutes or time scale, respectively (Figure 4.12).

Figure 4.12. Dead Reckoning Computer Slide Rule Face.




4.7.3. The numbers on each scale represent the printed figure with the decimal point moved any number
of places to the right or left. For example, the numbers on either scale can represent 1.2, l2, 120, 1200,
etc.

4.7.4. Since speed (or fuel consumption) is expressed in miles (or gallons or pounds) per hour (60
minutes), a large black arrow marked speed index is placed at the 60-minute mark.

4.7.5. Graduations of both scales are identical. The graduations are numbered from l0 to 100 and the unit
intervals decrease in size as the numbers increase in size. Not all unit intervals are numbered. The first
element of skill in using the computer is a sure knowledge of how to read the numbers.

4.8. Reading the Slide Rule Face. The unit intervals that are numbered present no difficulty. The
problem lies in giving the correct values to the many small lines that come between the numbered
intervals. There are no numbers given between 25 and 30 as shown in Figure 4.14, for example, but it is
obvious that the larger intermediate divisions are 26, 27, 28, and 29. Between 25 and (unnumbered) 26,
there are five smaller divisions, each of which would, therefore, be .2 of the larger unit. A mental
estimate will aid in placing the decimal point.
122                                               AFPAM11-216   1 MARCH 2001

Figure 4.14. Reading the Slide Rule Face.




4.9. Problems on the Slide Rule Face:

4.9.1. Simple Proportion. The slide rule face of the computer is so constructed that any relationship
between two numbers, one on the miles scale and one on the minutes scale, will hold true for all other
numbers on the two scales. Thus, if the two 10s are placed opposite each other, all other numbers will be
identical around the circle. If 20 on the minutes scale is placed opposite 10 on the miles scale, all
numbers on the minutes scale will be double of those on the miles scale. This feature allows one to
supply the fourth term of any mathematical proportion. Thus, the unknown in the equation could be
solved on the computer by setting 18 on the miles scale over 45 on the minutes scale and reading the
answer (32) above the 80 on the minutes scale. It is this relationship that makes possible the solution of
time-speed-distance problems. This can also be solved algebraically: (45X=18x80 therefore
X=[18x80]/45).




4.9.2. Time, Speed, and Distance:

4.9.2.1. An aircraft has traveled 24 miles in 8 minutes. How many minutes will be required to travel 150
miles? This is a simple proportion which can be written as:




Setting the 24 over the 8 on the computer as illustrated in Figure 4.15 and reading under the 150, we find
the answer to be 50 minutes.

4.9.2.2. A problem that often occurs is to find the GS of the aircraft when a given distance is traveled in
a given time. This is solved in the same manner, except the computer is marked with a speed index to
aid in finding the correct proportion. In the problem just stated, if 24 is set over 8 as in the original
problem, the GS of the aircraft, 180 knots, is read above the speed index as shown.

          Given:        GS 204 knots
          Find:         Distance traveled in 1 hour 15 minutes (75 minutes)
124                                                               AFPAM11-216         1 MARCH 2001

Solution: Set the speed index on the minutes scale to 204 on the miles scale. Opposite 75 on the minutes
scale, read 255 NM on the miles scale. The computer solution is shown in Figure 4.16. The solutions for
time and speed when the other variables are known follow the same basic format (Figures 4.17 and
4.18).

Figure 4.17. Solving for Time When Speed and Distance Are Known.




Figure 4.18. Solving for Speed When Time and Distance Are Known.




4.9.3. Seconds Index. Since 1 hour is equivalent to 3,600 seconds, a subsidiary index mark, called
seconds index, is marked at 36 on the minutes scale of some computers. When placed opposite a speed
on the miles scale, the index relates the scales for converting distance to time in seconds. Thus, if 36 is
placed opposite a GS of 144 knots, 50 seconds is required to go 2 NM; and in 150 seconds (2 minutes 30
seconds), 6.0 NM are covered. Similarly, if 4 NM are covered in 100 seconds, GS is 144 knots (Figure
4.19).

4.9.4. Conversion of Distance. Subsidiary indexes are placed on some computers to aid in the
conversion of distances from one unit of measure to another. The most common interconversions are
those involving statute miles, NM, and kms.
126                                                             AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

Figure 4.19. Seconds Index.




4.9.5. Statute-NM Interconversion. The miles scale of the computer is marked with a statute mile
index at 76 and a NM index at 66. The units are interconverted by setting the known distance under the
appropriate index and reading the desired unit under the other.

EXAMPLE: To convert 136 statute miles to NMs, set 136 on the minutes scale under the STAT index
on the miles scale. Under the NAUT index on the miles scale, read the number of NMs (118) on the
minutes scale (Figure 4.20).


Figure 4.20. Statute Mile, Nautical Mile, and Kilometer Interconversion.




4.9.6. Conversion of Nautical Miles (NM) or Statute Miles to Kilometers (km). A km index is
indicated on the miles scale of the computer at 122. When NM or statute miles are placed under their
appropriate index on the miles scale, kms may be read, on the minutes scale, under the km index.

EXAMPLE: To convert 118 NM to kms, place 118 on the minutes scale under the NAUT index on the
miles scale. Under the km index on the miles scale, read kms (218) on the minutes scale.

4.9.7. Multiplication and Division. To multiply two numbers, for example 12 X 2, the index (printed as
10 on the minutes scale) is placed opposite one of the numbers to be multiplied (12), and the product
(24) is read on the miles scale above the other number (2) on the minutes scale (Figure 4.21).
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                          127

4.9.7.1. To divide one number by another, for example 24/8, set the divisor (8) on the minutes scale
opposite the dividend (24) on the miles scale, and read the quotient (3) on the miles scale opposite the
index on the minutes scale (Figure 4.22).


Figure 4.21. Multiplying Two Numbers.




Figure 4.22. Dividing One Number by Another.




4.9.7.2. In the computations encountered in air navigation, as in the above examples, a mental estimate
will aid in placing the decimal point.

Section 4Câ€”Effect of Wind on Aircraft

4.10. Basics. Any vehicle traveling on the ground, such as an automobile, moves in the direction in
which it is steered or headed and is affected very little by wind. However, an aircraft seldom travels in
exactly the direction in which it is headed because of the wind effect.

4.10.1. Any free object in the air moves downwind with the speed of the wind. This is just as true of an
aircraft as it is of a balloon. If an aircraft is flying in a 20-knot wind, the body of air in which it is flying
moves 20 NM in 1 hour. Therefore, the aircraft also moves 20 NM downwind in 1 hour. This movement
is in addition to the forward movement of the aircraft through the body of air.
128                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

4.10.2. The path of an aircraft over the earth is determined by the two unrelated factors shown in Figure
4.23: (1) the motion of the aircraft through the airmass, and (2) the motion of the airmass across the
earth's surface. The motion of the aircraft through the airmass is directly forward in response to the pull
of the propellers or thrust of the jet engines, and its rate of movement through the airmass is TAS. This
motion takes place in the direction of true heading (TH). This motion of the airmass across the earth's
surface may be from any direction and at any speed. The measurement of its movement is called wind
and is expressed in direction and speed (wind vector [W/V]).

Figure 4.23. Two Factors Determine Path of Aircraft.




4.11. Drift Caused by Wind. The effect of wind on the aircraft is to cause it to follow a different path
over the ground than it does through the airmass. The path over the ground is its track. The terms true
course (TC) and track are often considered synonymous. TC represents the intended path of the aircraft
over the earth's surface. Track is the actual path that the aircraft has flown over the earth's surface. TC is
considered to be future, while track is considered to be past.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        129

4.11.1. The lateral displacement of the aircraft caused by the wind is called drift. Drift is the angle
between the TH and the track. As shown in Figure 4.24 the aircraft has drifted to the right; this is known
as right drift.

4.11.2. With a given wind, the drift will change on each heading. A change of heading will also affect
the distance flown over the earth's surface in a given time. This rate traveled relative to the earth's
surface is known as GS. Therefore, with a given wind, the GS varies on different headings.

4.11.3. Figure 4.25 shows the effect of a 270o/20 knots wind on the GS and track of an aircraft flying on
headings of 000o, 090o, 180o, and 270o. The aircraft flies on each heading from point X for 1 hour at a
constant TAS.

4.11.4. Note that on a TH of 000o, the wind causes right drift; whereas on a TH of 180o, the same wind
causes left drift. On the headings of 090o and 270o, there is no drift at all. Note further that on a heading
of 090o the aircraft is aided by a tailwind and travels farther in 1 hour than it would without a wind; thus,
its GS is increased by the wind. On the heading of 270o, the headwind cuts down on the GS and also
cuts down the distance traveled. On the headings of 000o and 180o, the GS is unchanged.

Figure 4.25. Effects of Wind on Aircraft Flying in Opposite Directions.




4.12. Drift Correction Compensates for Wind. In Figure 4.26, suppose the navigator wants to fly from
point A to point B, on a TC of 000o, when the wind is 270o/20 knots. If the navigator flew a TH of 000o,
the aircraft would not end up at point B but at some point downwind from B.

4.12.1. By heading the aircraft upwind to maintain the TC, drift will be compensated for. The angle
BAC is called the drift correction angle or, more simply, the drift correction. Drift correction is the
correction which is applied to a TC to find the TH.

4.12.2. Figure 4.27 shows the drift correction necessary in a 270o/20 knots wind if the aircraft is to make
good a TC of 000o, 090o, 180o or 270o. When drift is right, correct to the left, and the sign of the
correction is minus. When the drift is left, correct to the right, and the sign of the correction is plus.

4.13. Vectors and Vector Diagrams. In aerial navigation, there are many problems to solve involving
speeds and directions. These speeds and directions fit together in pairs: one speed with one direction.

4.13.1. By using vector solution methods, unknown quantities can be found. For example, TH, TAS, and
W/V may be known, and track and GS unknown. To solve such problems, the relationships of these
quantities must be understood.

4.13.2. The vector can be represented on paper by a straight line. The direction of this line would be its
angle measured clockwise from true north (TN), while the magnitude or speed is the length of the line
compared to some arbitrary scale. An arrowhead is drawn on the line representing a vector to avoid any
misunderstanding of its direction. This line drawn on paper to represent a vector is known as a vector
diagram, or often it is referred to simply as a vector as shown in Figure 4.28. Future references to the
word vector will mean its graphic representation.
132                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 4.27. Maintaining Course in Wind.




4.13.3. Two or more vectors can be added together simply by placing the tail of each succeeding vector
at the head of the previous vector. These vectors added together are known as component vectors.

4.13.4. The sum of the component vectors can be determined by connecting, with a straight line, the tail
of one vector to the head of the other. This sum is known as the resultant vector. By its construction, the
resultant vector forms a closed figure as shown in Figure 4.29. Notice the resultant is the same,
regardless of the order, as long as the tail of one vector is connected to the head of another.

4.13.5. The points to remember about vectors are as follows:

4.13.5.1. A vector possesses both direction and magnitude. In aerial navigation, these are referred to as
direction and speed.

4.13.5.2. When the components are represented tail to head in any order, a line connecting the tail of the
first and the head of the last represents the resultant.

4.13.5.3. All component vectors must be drawn to the same scale.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     133

4.14. Wind Triangle and Its Solution:

4.14.1. Vector Diagrams and Wind Triangles. A vector illustration showing the effect of the wind on
the flight of an aircraft is called a wind triangle. Draw a line to show the direction and speed of the
aircraft through airmass (TH and TAS); this vector is called the air vector. Using the same scale, connect
the tail of the wind vector to the head of the air vector. Draw a line to show the direction and speed of
the wind (W/V); this is the wind vector. A line connecting the tail of the air vector with the head of the
wind vector is the resultant of these two component vectors; it shows the direction and speed of the
aircraft over the earth (track and GS). It is called the ground vector.

4.14.1.1. To distinguish one from another, it is necessary to mark each vector. Accomplish this by
placing one arrowhead at midpoint on the air vector pointing in the direction of TH. The ground vector
134                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

has two arrowheads at midpoint in the direction of track. The wind vector is labeled with three
arrowheads in the direction the wind is blowing. The completed wind triangle is shown in Figure 4.30.

Figure 4.30. Mark Each Vector of Wind Triangle.




4.14.1.2. Remember that wind direction (WD) and windspeed (WS) compose the wind vector. True
airspeed (TAS) and true heading (TH) form the air vector and GS and track compose the ground vector.

4.14.1.3. The ground vector is the resultant of the other two; hence, the air vector and the wind vector
are always drawn head to tail. An easy way to remember this is that the wind always blows the aircraft
from TH to track.

4.14.1.4. Consider just what the wind triangle shows. In Figure 4.31, the aircraft departs from point A on
the TH of 360o at a TAS of 150 knots. In 1 hour, if there is no wind, it reaches point B at a distance of
150 NM.

4.14.1.5. In actuality, the wind is blowing from 270o at 30 knots. At the end of 1 hour, the aircraft is at
point C 30 NM downwind. Therefore, the length BC represents the speed of the wind drawn to the same
scale as the TAS. The length of BC represents the wind and is the wind vector.

4.14.1.6. Line AC shows the distance and direction the aircraft travels over the ground in 1 hour. The
length of AC represents the GS drawn to the same scale as the TAS and windspeed. Thus, the line AC,
which is the resultant of AB and BC, represents the motion of the aircraft over the ground and is the
ground vector.

4.14.1.7. Measuring the length of AC determines that the GS is 153 knots. Measuring the drift angle,
BAC, and applying it to the TH of 360o, results in the track of 011o.

4.14.1.8. If two vectors in a wind triangle are known, the third one can be found by drawing a diagram
and measuring the parts. Actually, the wind triangle includes six quantities; three speeds and three
directions. Problems involving these six quantities make up a large part of DR navigation. If four of
these quantities are known, the other two can be found. This is called solving the wind triangle and is an
important part of navigation.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      135

Figure 4.31. Wind Triangle.




4.14.1.9. The wind triangle may be solved by trigonometric tables; however, this is unnecessary since
the accuracy of this method far exceeds the accuracy of the data available and the results needed. In
flight, the wind triangle is solved graphically, either on the chart or on the vector or wind face of the
computer.

4.14.1.10. The two graphic solutions of the wind triangle (chart solution and computer solution) perhaps
appear dissimilar at first glance. However, they work on exactly the same principles. Plotting the wind
triangle on paper has been discussed; now, the same triangle is plotted on the wind face of the computer.

4.14.2. Wind Triangles on DR Computer. The wind face of the computer has three parts: (1) a frame,
(2) a transparent circular plate which rotates in the frame, and (3) a slide or card which can be moved up
and down in the frame under the circular plate. This portion of the computer is illustrated in Figure 4.32.

4.14.2.1. The frame has a reference mark called the TRUE INDEX. A drift scale is graduated 45o to the
left and 45o to the right of the true index; to the left this is marked DRIFT LEFT, and to the right,
DRIFT RIGHT.
136                                      AFPAM11-216   1 MARCH 2001

Figure 4.32. Wind Face of DR Computer.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       137

4.14.2.2. The circular plate has around its edge a compass rose graduated in units of 1 degree. The
position of the plate may be read on the compass rose opposite the true index. Except for the edge, the
circular plate is transparent so that the slide can be seen through it. Pencil marks can be made on the
transparent surface. The centerline is cut at intervals of two units by arcs of concentric circles called
speed circles; these are numbered at intervals of 10 units.

4.14.2.3. On each side of the centerline are track lines, which radiate from a point of origin off the slide
as shown in Figure 4.33. Thus, the 14o track line on each side of the centerline makes an angle of 14o
with the centerline at the origin. And the point where the 14o track line intersects the speed circle
marked 160 is 160 units from the origin.

Figure 4.33. Speed Circles and Track Lines.
138                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

4.14.2.4. In solving a wind triangle on the computer, plot part of the triangle on the transparent surface
of the circular plate. For the other parts of the triangle, use the lines that are already drawn on the slide.
Actually, there isn't room for the whole triangle on the computer, for the origin of the centerline is one
vertex of the triangle. When learning to use the wind face of the computer, it may help to draw in as
much as possible of each triangle.

4.14.2.5. The centerline from its origin to the grommet always represents the air vector. If the TAS is
150k, move the slide so that 150 is under the grommet; then the length of the vector from the origin to
the grommet is 150 units as illustrated in A of Figure 4.34.

4.14.2.6. The ground vector is represented by one of the track lines, with its tail at the origin and its head
at the appropriate speed circle. If the track is 15o to the right of the TH, and the GS is 180 knots, use the
track line 15o to the right of the centerline and consider the intersection of this line with the 180 speed
circle as the head of the vector as illustrated in B of Figure 4.34.

4.14.2.7. The tail of the wind vector is at the grommet and its head is at the head of the ground vector as
shown in C of Figure 4.34.

4.14.2.8. Thus far, nothing has been said about the direction of the vectors. Since the true index is over
the centerline beyond the head of the air vector, this vector always points toward the index. Therefore,
TH is read on the compass rose opposite the true index.

4.14.2.9. Since track is TH with the drift angle applied, the value of track can be found on the scale of
the circular plate opposite the drift correction on the drift scale. The wind vector is drawn with its tail at
the grommet as shown in Figure 4.35. Since WD is the direction from which the wind blows, it is
indicated on the compass rose by the rearward extension of the wind vector. Therefore, the most
convenient way to draw the wind vector is to set WD under the true index and draw the vector down the
centerline from the grommet; the scale on the centerline can then be used to determine the length of the
vector.

4.14.2.10. Conversely, to read a wind already determined, place the head of the wind vector on the
centerline below the grommet and read WD below the true index.

4.14.3. Wind Triangle Problems. Depending on which of the six quantities of the wind triangle are
known and which are unknown, there are three principal types of problems to solve. They are to solve
for (1) the ground vector, (2) the wind vector, and (3) TH and GS. The following discussion gives the
steps for the computer solution for each type. Work each sample problem and notice that the same wind
triangle is shown on the computer that is shown on the chart, even though it is not completely drawn on
the computer.

4.14.3.1. To find ground vector when air vector and wind vector are known:

          Given:          TH 100o
                          TAS 210 knots
                          W/V 020o/25 knots
          Find:           Track and GS
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     139

Figure 4.34. Plotting a Wind Triangle on Computer.




4.14.3.2. This type of problem arises when TH and TAS are known by reading the flight instruments and
when the WD and velocity are known from either the metro forecast or from calculations in flight.

4.14.3.3. Study Figure 4.36 and determine what has happened. By flying a TH of 100o at a TAS of 210
knots in a wind of 020o/25 knots, the aircraft has actually moved over the ground along a track of 107o at
a GS of 208 knots.

4.14.3.4. Computer Solution: First, set the data:

4.14.3.4.1. Set WD (020o) under the true index.

4.14.3.4.2. Draw the wind vector from the grommet down the centerline, making its length (25 units)
along the speed scale to conform with the windspeed (25 knots).

4.14.3.4.3. Set the TH (100o) under the true index by rotating the compass rose.

4.14.3.4.4. Slide the card up or down until the TAS (2l0 knots) is under the grommet. The graphic
solution is now displayed on the computer as illustrated in Figure 4.37. The ground vector lies along one
of the radiating track lines with its head at the head of the wind vector.


Figure 4.37. Solving for Track and Groundspeed Using Computer.




4.14.3.4.5. Read GS (208 knots) on the speed circle which passes through the head of the ground vector.

4.14.3.4.6. Read the drift angle (7o right) by counting the number of degrees from the centerline to the
ground vector; that is, to the head of the wind vector.

4.14.3.4.7. Determine track (107o) by applying the drift angle to the TH. If the track is right of the center
line, it is greater than the TH; so the drift angle must be added to the TH. An alternate method of
determining track on the computer is to read the drift angle at the head of the ground vector, then
transform this value to the drift scale on the same side of the true index and read the track on the
compass rose of the circular disk.

4.14.3.5. To find wind vector when air vector and ground vector are known.

           Given:          TH 270o
                           Track 280o
                           TAS 230 knots
                           GS 215 knots
           Find:           wind vector

4.14.3.6. This type of problem arises when determination of TH and TAS can be done by reading the
flight instruments and finding track and GS either by measuring the direction and distance between two
established positions of the aircraft or by determining the drift angle and GS by reference to the ground.
Refer to Figure 4.38 for a graphic solution.

4.14.4. Computer Solution (Figure 4.39). First, set in the data:

4.14.4.1. Set the TH (270o) under the true index.

4.14.4.2. Set the TAS (230 knots) under the grommet.

4.14.4.3. Find the drift angle (10o right) by comparing the TH (270o) with the track (280o). If the track is
greater than the TH, drift is right; if it is less, drift is left. Find the appropriate track line on the computer
(10o right of centerline).

4.14.4.4. Find the speed circle (215 knots) corresponding to the GS circle. The wind triangle is now
constructed. The mark made is the head of the wind vector and the head of the ground vector.

4.14.4.5. Rotate the compass rose until the head of the wind vector is on the centerline below the
grommet. Read the WD (207o) under the true index.

4.14.4.6. Read the windspeed (42 knots) on the speed scale between the grommet and the head of the
wind vector.

4.14.4.7. To find true heading (TH) and groundspeed (GS) when true course (TC), true airspeed (TAS)
and wind vector are known:

      Given:        TC 230o
                    TAS 220 knots
                    W/V 270o/50 knots
      Find:         TH and GS


4.14.4.8. This type of problem arises before a flight or during a flight, when you need to determine a TH
to fly and a GS with which to compute an estimated time of arrival (ETA).

4.14.5. Chart Solution (Figure 4.40). First, construct the triangle.

4.14.5.1. Draw the wind vector in any convenient scale in the direction toward which the wind is
blowing (090o) and to the length representing the windspeed (50 knots) (from any origin).

4.14.5.2. Draw a line in the direction of the TC (230o) and of indefinite length, since the GS is not
known (from same origin).

4.14.5.3. Open the dividers an amount equal to TAS (220 knots); then, from the head of the wind arrow,
swing an arc with a radius of 220 NM to intersect the TC line (using the same scale as in step 1).
144                                                                AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001

4.14.5.4. Draw a line from the point of intersection of the arc and the TC line to the head of the wind
arrow.

4.14.5.5. To determine the TH (238o), measure the direction of the air vector.

4.14.5.6. To determine the GS (179 knots), measure the length of the ground vector, using the same
scale as before.

4.14.6. Computer Solution. There are two methods to solve for TH and GS. They are the slip-and-slide
method and the juggle method. Both will be discussed; however, the slip-and-slide method is normally
preferred.

4.14.6.1. Slip-and-Slide Method (Figure 4.41):

4.14.6.1.1. Set WD (270o) under the true index.

4.14.6.1.2. Draw the wind vector down the center from the grommet, making its length along the speed
scale correspond to the windspeed (50 knots).

4.14.6.1.3. Set the TC (230o) under the true index.

4.14.6.1.4. Set end of wind vector on the TAS (220 knots) by moving the slide.
AFPAM11-216            1 MARCH 2001                                                               145

Figure 4.41. Solving for TH & GS Using Slip-and-Slide Method.




4.14.6.1.5. Read drift left or right (8o left).

4.14.6.1.6. Apply drift correction mathematically to TC and set this computed TH under the true index
(238o).

4.14.6.1.7. Move the slide up until the grommet is on TAS (220 knots). The wind triangle is now set up
correctly.

4.14.6.1.8. Read GS at the end of the wind vector (l79 knots).

4.14.6.2. The Juggle Method (Figure 4.42):

4.14.6.2.1. Set WD (270o) under the true index.

4.14.6.2.2. Draw the wind vector down the center from the grommet, making its length along the speed
scale correspond to the windspeed (50 knots).

4.14.6.2.3. Set the TAS (220 knots) under the grommet.
146                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 4.42. Solving for TH & GS Using the Juggle Method.




4.14.6.2.4. Set the TC (230o) under the true index (Figure 4.42). The wind triangle is set up incorrectly,
for TC rather than TH is set under the true index. However, since the TH is not known, the TC is used as
a first approximation of the TH. This will give a first approximation of the drift angle, which can be
applied to the TC to get a more accurate idea of the TH.

4.14.6.2.5. Determine the drift angle (10o left) on the approximate heading (230o) to obtain a second
approximation of the TH (240o). If the drift angle is right, the drift correction is minus; if it is left, the
drift correction is plus.

4.14.6.2.6. Set the second approximate heading (240o) under the true index. Read the drift angle for this
heading (8o left). To correct the wind triangle, the drift angle which is read at the head of the wind vector
must equal the difference between the TC and the TH which is set under the true index. As it stands, the
drift angle is 8o left, while the difference between TC and the indicated TH is 10o left.

4.14.6.2.7. Juggle the compass rose until the drift angle equals the difference between TC and TH. In
this example, the correct drift angle is 8o left. Now the wind triangle is set up correctly.

4.14.6.2.8. Read the TH (238o) under the true index.

4.14.6.2.9. Read the GS (179 knots) on the speed circle passing through the head of the wind vector.

4.15. Average Wind Affecting Aircraft. An average wind is an imaginary wind which would produce
the same wind effect during a given period as two or more actual winds which affect the aircraft during
that period. Sometimes an average wind can be applied once instead of applying each individual wind
separately.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        147

4.15.1. Authentically Averaging WDs. If the wind directions (WD) are fairly close together, a
satisfactory average wind can be determined by arithmetically averaging the WDs and windspeeds.
However, the greater the variation in WD, the less accurate the result will be. It is generally accepted
that winds should not be averaged arithmetically if the difference in directions exceeds 090o and/or the
speed of less than 15 knots. In this case, there are other methods which may be used to obtain a more
accurate average wind. A chart solution is shown in Figure 4.43.

4.15.2. Computer Solution. Winds can be averaged by vectoring them on the wind face of the DR
computer, using the square grid portion of the slide and the rotatable compass rose. Average the
following three winds by this method: 030o/l5 knots, 080o/20 knots and 150o/35 knots:

4.15.2.1. Place the slide in the computer so that the top line of the square grid portion is directly under
the grommet and the compass rose is oriented so that the direction of the first wind (030o) is under the
true index. The speed of the wind (15 knots) is drawn down from the grommet (A of Figure 4.44).

4.15.2.2. Turn the compass rose until the direction of the second wind (080o) is under the true index and
then reposition the slide so that the head of the first wind vector is resting on the top line of the square
grid section of the slide. Draw the speed of the second wind (20 knots) straight down (parallel to the
vertical grid lines) from the head of the first wind arrow (B of Figure 4.44).

4.15.2.3. Turn the compass rose so that the direction of the third wind (150o) is under the true index and
reposition the slide so that the head of the second wind vector is resting on the top line of the square grid
section of this slide. Draw the speed of the third wind (35 knots) straight down from the head of the
second wind arrow (C of Figure 4.44).

4.15.2.4. Turn the compass rose so the head of the third wind arrow is on centerline below the grommet.
Reposition the slide to place the grommet on the top line of the square grid section. The resultant or
average wind direction is read directly beneath the true index (108o). Measuring the length of the
resultant wind vector (46) on the square grid section and divide it by the number of winds used (3) to
determine the windspeed. This will give a WS of about 15Â½ knots. The average wind then is 108o/15 1/2
knots (D of Figure 4.44).

4.15.2.5. With a large number of winds to be averaged or high windspeeds, it may not possible to draw
all the wind vectors on the computer unless the windspeeds are cut by 1/2 or 1/3. If one windspeed is
cut, all windspeeds must be cut. In determining the resultant windspeed, the length of the total vector
must be multiplied by 2 or 3, depending on how the windspeed was cut, and then divided by the total
number of winds used. In cutting the speeds, the direction is not affected and the WD is read under the
true index.

4.15.2.6. Wind effect is proportional to time (Figure 4.45). To sum up two or more winds which have
affected the aircraft for different lengths of time, weigh them in proportion to the times. If one wind has
acted twice as long as another, its vector should be drawn in twice as shown. In determining the average
windspeed, this wind must be counted twice.

4.16. Resolution of Rectangular Coordinates. Data for radar equipment is often given in terms of
rectangular coordinates; therefore, it is important that the navigator be familiar with the handling of
these coordinates. The DR computer provides a ready and easy method of interconversion.

centerline of the value of the second cardinal direction and mark the point.

                                           RADIO AID FIXING

Section 5Aâ€”Bearings and Lines of Position

5.1. Basics. Good dead reckoning (DR) techniques can result in fairly accurate positions. But, even
when employing the very best techniques, the DR position will become less accurate as time increases
beyond the last known position. Small errors tend to accumulate into one total error which is
unacceptable. To minimize this error, the navigator must be able to establish an accurate position from
which to restart DR. This accurate position is free of any DR errors and is called a fix. A fix is simply a
point from which the navigator can restart DR, just as if it were the takeoff point. We will begin our
discussion of fixing with an explanation of lines of position (LOP).

5.2. LOP Explained. It is possible to solve part of the fix problem without knowing your exact location.
For example, assume you are in a strange town and you call a friend to meet you downtown. If you tell
this person that you are somewhere on Park Street, your friend can limit any search for you to that
particular street. In this case, Park Street is an LOP. An LOP is a series of possible positions or fixes. It
can be a straight line (such as a city street) or a curved line (such as a river), but it gives a definite clue
to your position.

5.2.1. If you tell your friend that you are at Park Street where it crosses the Karuzas River, it would then
establish your exact location. You have used two LOPs to determine your exact position. Thus, two
intersecting LOPs identify a point which establishes a fix.

5.2.2. You can use the same procedure as a navigator. You may be flying along a railroad that you
identify as the Jedicke Railroad on your chart. As you continue on this course, you notice the railroad
crosses a river that is labeled the King River on your chart. When you fly over the point where these two
visual LOPs cross, you know your exact location over the ground and on your chart. You now have a fix
from which you can continue to DR.

5.3. Types of LOPs. A fix gives definite information as to both track and groundspeed (GS) of an
aircraft since the last fix, but a single LOP can only define either the track or the GS--not both. And it
may not clearly define either. The evidence obtained from an LOP depends upon the angle at which it
intersects the track. LOPs are sometimes classified according to this angle.

5.3.1. Course Line. An LOP which is parallel or nearly parallel to the course is called a course line
(Figure 5.1). It gives information as to possible locations of the aircraft laterally in relation to the course;
that is, whether it is to the right or left of course. Because it does not indicate how far the aircraft is
along the track, no speed information is provided.

5.3.2. Speed Line. An LOP which is perpendicular, or nearly so, to the track is called a speed line
(Figure 5.2) because it indicates how far the aircraft has traveled along the track and, thus, is a measure
of GS. It does not indicate whether the aircraft is to the right or left of the course.
152                                                               AFPAM11-216         1 MARCH 2001

Figure 5.1. Line of Position Parallel to Track Is Course Line.




Figure 5.2. Line of Position Perpendicular to Track Is Speed Line.




5.3.3. LOPs by Bearings. One method of determining an LOP is to establish the direction of the line of
sight (LOS) to a known fixed object. The direction of the LOS is the bearing of the object from the
aircraft. A line plotted in the direction of the bearing is an LOP. At the time of the observation, the
aircraft was on the LOP.

5.3.4. Relative Bearings (RB). An RB is the angle between the fore-and-aft axis of the aircraft and the
LOS to the object, always measured clockwise from 000o at the nose of the aircraft through 360o. In
Figure 5.3, the RB of the object is shown as 070o. You must convert this to a true bearing (TB) before
you can plot it. To do this, you simply add the RB to the true heading (TH) the aircraft was flying when
you obtained the bearing. (Subtract 360o if the total exceeds this amount.) Thus:

       RB + TH = TB (RuB THe TuB)
       Where:
       RB is the relative bearing,
       TH is the true heading, and
       TB is the true bearing.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                        153

Assuming the aircraft was on a TH of 210o when the bearing was taken, the corresponding TB of the
object is 280o. (070o RB + 210o TH = 280o TB)


Figure 5.3. True Bearing Equals Relative Bearing Plus True Heading.




5.4. Plotting the LOP. As previously stated, two intersecting LOPs determine the position of the
aircraft. The only other possible point from which to begin plotting the LOP is the object on which you
took the bearing. The procedure is to use the reciprocal of the TB of the object, thus drawing an LOP
toward the aircraft. In actual practice, it is not necessary to compute the reciprocal of the bearing; the TB
is measured with the plotter, and the LOP is drawn toward the opposite end of the plotter. To establish
an LOP by RB, the navigator must know (1) the position of the source (object) of the bearing, (2) the TH
of the aircraft, (3) the RB of the object, and (4) the exact time at which the TH and RBs were taken.

Section 5Bâ€”Fixes

5.5. Adjusting LOPs for a Fix. Sometimes it is impossible for a navigator to obtain more than one LOP
at a given time. If two LOPs are for two different times, their intersection does not constitute a fix
because the aircraft moved between the time it was on the first LOP and the second LOP. The
illustration in Figure 5.4 shows a bearing taken at 1055Z and another at 1100Z. At 1055Z when the
navigator took the first bearing, the aircraft was somewhere along the 1055Z LOP (single-barbed LOP)
and, at 1100Z, it was somewhere along the 1100Z LOP. The intersection of these two lines, as plotted,
does not constitute a fix. For an intersection to become a fix, the navigator must either obtain the LOPs
at the same time or adjust them to a common time by using the motion of the aircraft between the
observations. The usual method of adjusting an LOP for the motion of the aircraft is to advance one line
to the time of the other. The illustration in Figure 5.4 shows how this is done. The desired time of the fix
is 1100Z.

5.5.1. Determine the time to advance the 1055Z LOP (5 minutes). Multiply this time by the aircraft GS
(300 knots).

5.5.2. Measure the distance computed in the first step in the direction of the track of the aircraft (045o).
154                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 5.4. Adjusting Lines of Position for Fix.




5.5.3. Draw a line through this point parallel to the 1055Z LOP (double-barbed LOP). This represents
the advanced LOP. The intersection of the advanced LOP and the 1100Z LOP is the fix. The advanced
LOP is usually plotted on the chart with two arrowheads, while the unadvanced LOP is marked with a
single arrowhead.

5.5.4. When three LOPs are involved, the procedure is exactly the same as for two. The resolution of
three LOPs, however, may result in a triangle instead of a point, and the triangle may be large enough to
vary the position of the fix. The technique many navigators use is to place the fix at the center of the
triangle. The illustration in Figure 5.5 shows a technique for finding the center of the triangle by
bisecting the angles of the triangle. The point of intersection of the bisectors is equal distance from all
three LOPs and is the fix position.


Figure 5.5. Bisector Method.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        155

5.6. The Running Fix. It is possible to establish an aircraft position by a series of bearings on the same
object. For best accuracy, these RBs are taken when the object is approximately 45o, 90o, and 135o from
the aircraft. The navigator then advances or retards the LOPs to a common time. The result is a running
fix. The accuracy is based on the aircrafts distance from object and the amount of time it takes to go
from the first bearing to the last bearing since you must move two of the LOPs for the aircrafts track and
GS. The running fix is illustrated in Figure 5.6.


Figure 5.6. The Running Fix.




5.7. Accuracy of a Fix. The accuracy of a fix can sometimes be improved by the use of a little foresight.
If the track of the aircraft is known more accurately than the GS, the course line should be adjusted since
any error in the GS will have little effect on it. If, however, you desire to adjust a speed line under these
conditions, the accuracy of the fix is in doubt. Similarly, if the GS is known more accurately than the
track, the speed line should be adjusted to the time of the course line. The line which will be affected
least by the information in doubt is the line which should be adjusted.

Section 5Câ€”Radio Aids

5.8. Basics. Radio aids are ground based navigation facilities that transmit electronic signals received by
airborne units. Radio aids can be used for departure, en route navigation or arrivals, and procedures for
obtaining and plotting a fix vary by category. Explanations of different types of radio aids and how to
fix with them follow.

5.9. Nondirectional Radio Beacon (NDB). This is a low, medium, or ultra high frequency (UHF) radio
beacon which transmits nondirectional signals whereby the user can determine a bearing and home to
the station. NDBs normally operate in the frequency band of 190 to 535 kilocycles (kHz) and transmit a
continuous carrier with either 400 or 1020 cycles per second (Hz) modulation. All radio beacons, except
156                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

the compass locators, transmit a continuous three-letter identification code except during voice
transmissions.

5.9.1. Disturbance. They are subject to disturbances that may result in erroneous bearing information.
Such disturbances result from intermittent or unpredictable signal propagation due to such factors as
lightning, precipitation, static, etc. At night, radio beacons are vulnerable to interference from distant
stations. Nearly all disturbances that affect the automatic direction finder (ADF) bearing also affect the
facility's identification. Noisy identification usually occurs when the ADF needle is erratic. Voice,
music, or erroneous identification will usually be heard when a steady false bearing is being displayed.
Since ADF receivers do not have a flag to warn the user when erroneous bearing information is being
displayed, the NDB's identification should be continuously monitored.

5.9.2. Control Panels. There are several different types of control panels currently installed in Air Force
aircraft. Refer to aircraft technical manuals for specific guidance pertaining to equipment operation.

5.10. Plotting on a Chart. Before an ADF bearing can be plotted on a navigation chart, two things must
be done. First, the bearing obtained must be converted to a true bearing (TB). If a nonrotatable compass
card is used, the resultant RB may be converted to TB by adding the aircraft true heading (TH) (TH +
RB = TB). If a rotatable compass card is used, the TB can be found by applying the magnetic variation
at the vicinity of the aircraft.

5.11. Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Direction Finders (DF). Some aircraft are equipped with ADFs in
the UHF frequency range (225.0â€“399.9 mHz) which utilize loop and sensing (antennas) to give bearing
information. Operation of the DF is controlled from the UHF radio panel. It is used to obtain bearing to
other aircraft and to emergency locator beacons.

5.12. VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR). VOR stations operate between 108.00 and 117.95
megacycles per second (mHz). VHF communications operate between 118.00 and 135.90 mHz. Station
identifiers for VOR NAVAIDs are given in code or voice, or by alternating code and voice
transmissions. VOR transmissions are limited by line of sight (LOS) and a combination of aircraft
altitude and distance to the station. Accurate information may be obtained from 40 to 100 NM around
the facility, although the usable range may be much greater (300 NM). VOR may be used by flying
courses from one station to another as part of the high or low jet navigation airways system. It may be
used as a fixing aid by taking a bearing and applying magnetic variation at the station (converting
magnetic bearing [MB] to TB) and plotting an LOP. In aircraft equipped with two VORs, the bearings to
two different stations may be taken simultaneously and plotted, and a fix position obtained. The aircraft
is directly overflying a VOR when the bearing pointer drops rapidly below the 3 or 9 o'clock position.

5.12.1. Control Panel. A VOR control panel contains (1) a power switch, (2) frequency window, (3)
volume control, (4) equipment self-test capability, and (5) frequency selector controls. All are shown in
Figure 5.7. To tune a VOR, turn power switch to PWR, select desired frequency and identify the station.
For positive test indications, consult applicable aircraft technical order.

5.12.2. Indicator Panel. Several types of indicators exist which display VOR information. Examples
shown here are the course indicator (Figure 5.8), the radio magnetic indicator (RMI) in Figure 5.9, and
the bearing direction heading indicator (BDHI) in Figure 5.10. The course indicator has eight significant
features: (1) TO-FROM indicator, (2) glide slope and course warning flags, (3) course selector window,
AFPAM11-216         1 MARCH 2001                                                                   157

(4) marker beacon light, (5) glide slope indicator, (6) heading pointer, (7) course deviation indicator
(CDI), and (8)course set knob.

Figure 5.10. Bearing Distance Heading Indicator.




5.12.3. Indicators. The TO-FROM indicator shows whether the radial set in the course selector window
is to or from the station, and the CDI represents this radial. If the aircraft is to the right of the radial, the
CDI is displaced to the left of center on the course indicator. The glide slope indicator is similar to the
CDI but represents the glide slope transmitted by an instrument landing system (ILS). If the glide slope
indicator is below the center of the course indicator, the aircraft is above the glide slope. The glide slope
and course warning flags inform the user that either the glide slope indicator or CDI is inoperative, or
that signals received are too weak to be used. The heading pointer indicates the difference, left or right,
between the aircraft MH and the radial set in the course selection window. The marker beacon light
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      159

flashes when passing over a marker beacon (such as, outer marker of the ILS). The RMI is a bearing
indicator, usually with two pointers and a movable compass rose. The compass rose rotates as the
aircraft turns, indicating the compass heading of the aircraft under the top of the index at all times.
Therefore, all bearings taken from an RMI are magnetic. Consult the specific technical order as to which
pointer is the VOR.

5.12.4. BDHI. The BDHI is similar to the RMI because the needles provides MB information.
Additional information concerning the BDHI is in the TACAN section.

5.13. Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN). The TACAN system was developed to provide the
crewmember with information needed for precise positioning within 200 NM. As with VOR, TACAN
provides an infinite number of radials radiating outwardly from the station. In addition, distance
measuring equipment (DME), an integral part of TACAN, provides continuous slant-range distance
information. TACAN operates in the UHF band and has 126 channels available in the X-band pulse
code. Development of pulse coding has given ground equipment the capability of an additional 126
channels in the Y-band. The station identifier is transmitted at 35-second intervals in international Morse
code. Airborne DME transmits on 1025-1150 mHz; associated ground-to-air frequencies are in the 962-
1024 mHz and 1151-1213 mHz ranges. Channels are separated at 1 mHz intervals in these bands.

5.13.1. Ground Equipment. The ground equipment consists of a rotating-type antenna for transmitting
bearing information and a receiver-transmitter (transponder) for transmitting distance information.
Permanent ground stations are dual transmitter-equipped (one operating and one in standby) installations
which automatically switch to the standby transmitter when a malfunction occurs. Each station has a
ground monitor which is set to alarm at a radial shift of 1o from the alignment to magnetic north (MN).
This alarm is usually located in the base control tower or approach control, and sets off a light and
buzzer to warn when an out-of-tolerance condition exists. It is possible to select a TACAN station and
get erroneous DME and azimuth lock-on when the station is undergoing maintenance. This can be
detected by an absence of signal identifier. Checks of en route or radio NAVAIDs may be made by
consulting NOTAMs prior to flight or by contacting air traffic control for advisories when airborne.

5.13.2. Airborne Equipment. The airborne equipment also contains a multichannel transmitter-receiver
(transceiver). Bearing information is automatically obtained with the correct channel selected. Distance
is determined by measuring the elapsed time between transmission of interrogating pulses of the
airborne set and reception of corresponding reply pulses from the ground stations. This sequence is
initiated by the aircraft transmitter and requires about 12 microseconds per NM round trip. Since the
DME gives a readout of slant range rather than ground range, a correction has to be applied to the
reading. (See slant range table for correction.)

5.13.2.1. DME is designed to provide reliable information to a maximum distance of 199 NM,
dependent on aircraft equipment and LOS. Accuracy is plus or minus one half NM or 3 percent of the
distance, whichever is greater.

5.13.2.2. Since a large number of aircraft could be interrogating the same station, the aircraft TACAN
must sort out the pulses which are replies to its own signal. Interrogation pulses are transmitted on an
irregular and random basis by the airborne set which then searches for replies synchronized to its own
interrogations. If the signals are interrupted, a memory circuit maintains the last distance indications on
the range indicator for approximately 10 seconds to prevent the search operation from recurring. This
process starts automatically when a new station is tuned or when there is a major interruption of signals.
160                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Depending upon the actual distance from the station, the searching process may require up to 22
seconds. The maximum number of aircraft which can be accommodated by one station at any one time
is 100. With the development of the X and Y bands, this number can be doubled.

5.14. TACAN Characteristics:

5.14.1. Bearing and/or Distance Unlock. Since TACAN bearing and DME are subject to LOS
restrictions, this information could be lost any time signals are blocked. Temporary obstructions can
occur in flight any time any part of the aircraft gets between the ground and aircraft antenna. Other
aircraft, terrain, and buildings are external causes for unlock. Any time the signal is obstructed for more
than 10 seconds for DME and 2 seconds for azimuth, the unlock conditions will be indicated by a
rotating bearing needle and a tumbling DME readout.

5.14.2. Azimuth Cone of Confusion. TACAN antennas transmit radio energy in circular patterns out
from the transmitter. However, waves are not transmitted directly above the station. Therefore, as the
aircraft approaches a TACAN station, signals are lost. This is indicated by a rotating TACAN bearing
needle in the RMI. The azimuth cone can be up to 100o or more in width or approximately 15 NM wide
at 40,000 feet. Thus, one may enter the cone of confusion at approximately 7.5 DME at this altitude.
Approaching the station, usable TACAN information is lost before the cone is reached as aircraft
memory circuits maintain the last information.

5.14.3. Range Indicator Fluctuations. Slight oscillations up to approximately one forth NM are normal
for range indicator operation due to the pulses generated by the transmit or receive function. When a
usable signal is lost, the memory circuit maintains the indicated range for about 10 seconds, after which
unlock will occur unless usable signals are regained.

5.14.4. Forty Degree Azimuth Error Lock-on. The construction of the TACAN ground antenna is
such that it transmits a series of nine signal lobes (eight auxiliary and one main reference pulse) 40o
apart. With the airborne receiver working correctly, these pulses lock on the airborne equipment with the
main reference at 090o. With a weak signal, the main reference pulse may slide over or miss the 090o
slot and lock on at one of the auxiliary positions. When this occurs, azimuth indications will be 40o or a
multiple of 40o in error. Forty degrees azimuth lock-on error will not cause a course warning flag to
appear on the indicator. Rechanneling the airborne receiver may give the set another chance to lock on
properly.

5.14.5. Co-Channel Interference. Co-channel interference occurs when an aircraft is in a position to
receive TACAN signals from more than one ground station on the same frequency. This normally
occurs only at high altitudes when distance separation between like frequencies is inadequate. DME,
azimuth, or identification from either station may be received. This is not a malfunction of either
airborne or ground equipment, but a result of position.

5.14.6. Air-to-Air (A/A) TACAN. This function is provided to give distance information between two
aircraft, working in the same manner as a regular ground-based TACAN station. Some sets provide only
DME information. Newer sets provide both distance and bearing information to other aircraft. In order
to obtain useful information, the A/A function should be selected by both aircraft with a 63-channel
frequency separation.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                    161

5.14.6.1. In addition, each aircraft must have the same frequency band (X or Y) selected. Therefore, if
one aircraft sets A/A Channel 4 and the other sets A/A Channel 67 in the X band useful information
should be obtained.

5.14.6.2. A/A TACAN is primarily used during the rendezvous portions of air refueling operations or
formation flights. A prescribed turn range (DME) and offset (bearing, if available) between the two
aircraft are used to effect the rendezvous. Proper A/A channels for each air refueling route are found in
the FLIP Planning Document.

5.14.7. Tuning and Controls. The basic controls of most TACAN systems are shown in Figure 5.11.
The proper channel is tuned by rotating channel selector knobs (1) to any of 126 channels. Knob (2), the
internal test mode, validates working condition of TACAN. The channel mode selector (4) allows X or
Y band to be selected. These controls are presented in the channel indicator (3). A volume control (5)
adjusts the audio level of the station identifier signal. The TACAN test button permits the user to
perform a system self-test. The function selector (6) has four settings:

Figure 5.11. TACAN Control Panel.




5.14.7.1. OFFâ€”Removes power to the set.

5.14.7.2. RECâ€”Energizes the receiver to obtain bearing information.

5.14.7.3. T/Râ€”Energizes both receiver and transmitter to obtain both bearing and distance information.

5.14.7.4. A/Aâ€”Transmits and receives interrogations and replies to measure range to another A/A
TACAN-equipped aircraft. Bearing information is not provided on this set.

5.14.8. VORTAC. In order to provide both military and civilian pilots the capability of positioning from
the same radio NAVAIDs, a combination of VOR and TACAN station was developed. Each facility
offers three services. VOR azimuth signals are transmitted on the published VOR frequency. TACAN
azimuth and DME signals are broadcast on the published UHF channel.

5.15. Fix-to-Fix Navigation (Using RMI and BDHI). Flying from one radial and DME to another is
basic to many departures and approaches. A heading to the desired point may be derived quickly
through the use of an RMI, providing a radial and a separate readout of DME. The same procedures
apply for a BDHI. The following technique and example are provided in order to demonstrate how to
compute a heading. Refer to Figure 5.12.


      EXAMPLE:             Present Position 180o/60
                           Desired Position 090o/30
                           Present Heading 000o

Figure 5.12. Fix-to-Fix Solution.




5.15.1. Tune, identify, and monitor correct VOR and TACAN.

5.15.2. Turn the aircraft in the general direction of the desired fix by turning to a heading approximately
halfway between the head of the bearing pointer (000o) and the radial on which the desired fix is located
(090o). In this case, turn to 045o.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      163

5.15.3. Visualize your aircraft position and the desired fix on the RMI as follows:

5.15.3.1. The center of the RMI is considered to be the VOR or TACAN, and the compass rose
simulates the radials around the station.

5.15.3.2. The fix with the greater range (180o/60) is established at the outer edge of the compass card.

5.15.3.3. The fix with the lesser range (090o/30) is established at a point which is proportional to the
distance represented by the outer edge of the compass card.

5.15.4. Determine the heading to the desired fix by connecting your present position to your desired fix
with an imaginary line on the RMI (B to C). Establish another imaginary line parallel to the line labeled
B to C through the center of the RMI. This line will indicate your no-wind heading to your desired fix
(030o).

5.15.5. Turn to 030o and apply any drift correction. With 5o right drift, we would turn to 025o.

5.15.6. Cross-check your position continually and correct as necessary.

5.16. Fix-to-Fix Navigation (Using the MB-4 Computer). A fix-to-fix can also be computed on the
wind face side of an MB-4 computer. First, give the pilot a general heading toward the fix. (NOTE: You
can work in bearings; however, all work must be done in either bearings or radials to compute the
solution.) For the following example, radials will be used. The fix you wish to navigate to is the 280o
radial at 30 DME. Set up a graphic depiction on the wind face side of your computer with your present
position (350o radial at 050 DME) and the desired fix (280o/030). Use the following steps:

5.16.1. Place your present position (350o/050) on the wind face side using the square grid at the bottom
of the MB-4. Align 350o on the compass rose under the true index. Mark the point by counting down 50
NM from the true airspeed (TAS) grommet and mark with a +. Use the scale set up on the square grid or
set up an applicable scale. The scale used must remain constant throughout the problem (Figure 5.13).

5.16.2. Place the fix radial and DME (280o/030) on the computer the same way you did in step one
(Figure 5.14). Mark as a fix symbol (Î”).

5.16.3. Determine the no wind heading by rotating the compass rose so that the present position (+) is
directly above the fix (Î”). Use the square grid at the bottom to help with alignment (Figure 5.15). Turn
the aircraft to MC under the true index (206o for this example) and kill the drift. (NOTE: You can place
your present position (+) on the 0 NM horizontal baseline then, using your NM increment scale, count
down to the fix position (Î”) to determine how far you are from the fix (48 NM in this example; Figure
5.15.)

5.16.4. Repeat the procedure as necessary to keep your progress updated.

Section 5Dâ€”Communication

5.17. Long and Short Range Communication. Air-to-ground communications can be achieved
through the use of many types of radio equipment. High frequency bands (HF, VHF, UHF) are relatively
static-free and are less susceptible to outside interference than lower frequencies. It must be
remembered, however, that the higher the frequency, the more nearly the transmission will follow an
LOS path. As frequency increases, therefore, communication range decreases.

5.17.1. Long Range:

5.17.1.1. Systems used for long-range radio communications between aircraft and ground stations may
be either amplitude modulation (AM) or single sideband (SSB) transmissions. Single sideband
transmitters concentrate all available power into one sideband; therefore, SSB is much more efficient
and has greater range than an AM transmitter of the same power.

5.17.1.2. Although HF ground waves attenuate rapidly, sky waves at these frequencies are capable of
transmitting at distances up to 12,000 miles or more, depending on ionospheric conditions. HF
equipment is used mostly in remote areas where VHF or UHF communication is not possible because of
the great distance which must be spanned.

5.17.2. Short Range Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground. Short range air-to-air and air-to-ground
communications are confined to the VHF and UHF bands. VHF channels are spaced at 25 kHz intervals
from 116 to 151.975 mHz, and UHF channels are spaced at 50 kHz intervals from 225.0 to 399.9 mHz.
Most UHF and HF transceivers have a manual frequency selection capability in addition to a number of
preset channels. Transmission and reception are accomplished with a single antenna.
166                                                               AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

5.17.3. AN/APX-64 Transponder. The AN/APX-64 (Figure 5.16) provides for Mark X Identification
Friend or Foe (IFF) with selective identification feature (SIF) in normal operating modes. Two
additional modes allow more specific identification by controlling agencies. Mode C works in
conjunction with the aircraft altitude computer and gives automatic altitude reporting to ground radar.
Mode 4 provides a secure IFF capability for military aircraft. A typical IFF set has the following
features:


Figure 5.16. IFF/SIF Transponder.




5.17.3.1. IFF Master Control Knob. This is a five-position detented rotary switch: (1) OFF, (2)
STBYâ€”No transmission capability. Warmup period, (3) LOWâ€”Receiver sensitivity is reduced and
only local interrogations are answered, (4) NORMâ€”Full range operation, and (5) EMERâ€”Causes
automatic transmission of emergency reply signals when interrogated by Mode l, Mode 2, or Mode 3/A.

5.17.3.2. IFF Mode Switches. Four three-position toggle switches are used to select the desired
operating modes. Mode 1 is the aircraft security identity mode. Mode 2 is for unit identity. Mode 3/A is
for normal air traffic control identity. Mode C is the altitude reporting mode. The three positions are
identical for all four toggle switches: (1) OUTâ€”Mode disabled, (2) ONâ€”Allows normal response to
mode interrogations, and (3) TESTâ€”Spring-loaded for in-flight test of selected mode. Test
interrogations are generated, the transponder response is analyzed, and a positive indication illuminates
the test light.

5.17.3.3. Code Selector Wheels. (1) MODE 1â€”Sets any one of 32 possible codes, (2) MODE 2â€”Sets
any one of 4,096 possible codes. Not located on this control unit, and (3) MODE 3/Aâ€”Sets any one of
4,096 possible codes.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        167

5.17.3.4. Identification of Position Switch. A three-position toggle switch that enables IDENT replies
(This action illuminates the return on the controllers scope more brightly): (1) IDENTâ€”Spring-loaded
switch which initiates a 30-second reply, (2) OUTâ€”OFF, and (3) MICâ€”Initates a reply for 30 seconds
when the MIC button is depressed and the interphone transmitter selector knob is set to UHF.

5.17.3.5. Radar Test Monitor Switch. Used by ground maintenance and in conjunction with the test
lamp to monitor all responses in any SIF mode.

5.17.3.6. Test Lamp. Lights in conjunction with proper mode and/or test conditions and RAD
TEST/MON SW interrogations.

5.17.3.7. Mode 4. Mode 4 is a classified transponder system which provides secure IFF capability to
military aircraft. This capability is provided by an airborne cryptographic computer which generates
coded replies in response to valid interrogations generated by an interrogator cryptographic computer.
The aircrew or maintenance personnel set codes by a keying device prior to flight.

5.17.3.8. Mode 4, Enable Switch. Controls operation of Mode 4 and has three positions which permits
aural and reply lamp monitoring of valid Mode 4 interrogations and replies in AUDIO: (1) OUTâ€”No
monitoring capability, (2) LIGHTâ€”Reply lamp monitoring only, and (3) REPLY LAMPâ€”Used with
Mode 4 only.

5.18. Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Selective Identification Feature (SIF). IFF is an
airborne transponder that transmits coded signals when interrogated by ground-based search radar which
was first used during World War II. Pulses received from the airborne equipment produce blips on the
ground-based radarscope and are used to positively identify and locate aircraft. The addition of an SIF
allows faster isolation and identification of any aircraft under surveillance. The ground controller can
establish and maintain positive identification when a designated SIF mode and code is set into the
airborne transponder. Initial identification is usually established by using the IP or indent function of the
airborne set. Tracking is maintained by setting the requested mode and code into the aircraft equipment.

                                           MAP READING

Section 6Aâ€”Introduction

6.1. Basics. Map reading is the determination of aircraft position by matching natural or built-up
features with their corresponding symbols on a chart. It is one of the more basic aids to dead reckoning
(DR) and certainly the earliest used form of aerospace navigation. The degree of success in map reading
depends upon a navigator's proficiency in chart interpretation, ability to estimate distance, and the
availability of landmarks.


Figure 6.1. Landmarks as Checkpoints, Populated Areas.




6.2. Checkpoints. Checkpoints are landmarks or geographic coordinates used to fix the position of the
aircraft. By comparing the aircraft position to that of the checkpoint, the navigator fixes the aircraft's
location. Arrival over checkpoints at planned times is a confirmation of the wind prediction and
indicates reliability of the predicted track and groundspeed. If the aircraft passes near but not over a
checkpoint, the anticipated track was not made good. If checkpoints are crossed but not at the predicted
time, the anticipated GS was in error. Prudent navigators are quick to observe and evaluate the
difference between an anticipated position and an actual position. They must make corrections to
maintain their intended course as soon as possible because small errors can be cumulative and may
eventually result in the aircrew becoming lost. It is also important to closely monitor time control. On
many map reading missions, the aircraft is required to pass over certain checkpoints at exact times. On
these missions, navigators must adjust the airspeed to make good their anticipated GS.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        169

6.2.1. Before fixing each position, navigators should look for several related details around each
checkpoint to make sure it has been positively identified. For example, if the checkpoint is a small town,
there may be a lake to the north, a road intersection to the south, and a bridge to the east.

6.2.2. Generally, it is better to select a feature on the chart and then seek it on the ground rather than to
work from the ground to the chart. The chart does not show all the detail which is on the ground, and
one could easily become confused. Checkpoints should be features or groups of features that stand out
from the background and are easily identifiable. In open areas, any town or road intersection can be
used; however, these same features in densely populated areas are difficult to distinguish. Figures 6.1
and 6.2 compare various chart and corresponding photo areas and list the features to look for when
identifying landmarks as checkpoints.


Figure 6.2. Landmarks as Checkpoints, Coastal Areas.




6.3. Chart Selection. Use a chart for map reading that provides sufficient natural and built-up features
to accurately position the aircraft. The Operational Navigation Chart (ONC), with a scale of
1:1,000,000, has excellent cultural and relief portrayal. For increased detail, a Tactical Pilotage Chart
(TPC), with a scale of 1:500,000, or a Joint Operations Graphics (JOG) Chart with a scale of 1:250,000,
may be used. To extract minute details or precise coordinates, use a topographic line map (TLM) series
chart, typically at a scale of 1:50,000.

Section 6Bâ€”Map Reading Procedures

6.4. Basics. When inflight, orient the chart so that north on the chart is toward true north (TN). The
course line on the chart will then be aligned with the intended course of the aircraft so that landmarks on
the ground appear in the same relative position as the features on the chart. Obtain the approximate
position of the aircraft by DR. Select an identifiable landmark on the chart at or near the DR position. It
is important to work from the chart to the ground. Identify the landmark selected and fix the position of
the aircraft. The importance of a good DR cannot be over emphasized. When there is any uncertainty of
position, every possible detail should be checked before identifying a checkpoint. The relative positions
of roads, railroads, airfields, and bridges make good checkpoints. Intersections and bends in roads,
railroads, and rivers are equally good. When a landmark is a large feature, such as a major metropolitan
area, select a small prominent checkpoint within the large landmark to fix the position of the aircraft.
170                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

When a landmark is not available as a reference at a scheduled turning point, make the turn on the
estimated time of arrival (ETA). Extend the DR position to the next landmark and fix the position of the
aircraft to make sure the desired course and GS are being maintained. Remember, the desired magnetic
course on any given leg corrected for drift is the magnetic heading which will parallel course. This will
help to keep from getting any farther off course.

6.5. Low-Level Map Reading. On low-level flights, you may encounter additional difficulties.
Turbulence increases the difficulty of reading instruments. Depending on the aircraft's altitude above
ground level (AGL), the circle of visibility can be greatly reduced, and those objects that are visible pass
by so rapidly only the largest landmarks can be easily identified.

6.5.1. In low-level navigation, flight planning is especially important as there is little time for in flight
computations. An important part of good mission planning is proper chart preparation. The most
commonly used chart for low-level day operations is the JOG chart and at night a TPC. Normally radius-
of-turn procedures are used when drawing the chart, but depending on your tactics point to point is also
an option. Time elapsed marks and distance remaining marks along the course line of each leg will give
navigators a running DR with the aid of a stopwatch.

6.5.2. In low-level flight, one should be particularly alert to possible danger from obstructions. Hills and
mountains are easily avoided if the visibility is good. Radio and television towers, which may extend as
much as 1,000 feet or more into the air, often from elevated ground, are less conspicuous. All such
obstructions may or may not be shown on the aeronautical charts. Keep your charts updated with the
location of new obstructions by using the Chart Updating Manual (CHUM). The CHUM lists important
changes to all current navigation charts, but does not contain manmade obstacles less than 200 feet tall.
The CHUM is published twice a year with supplements published monthly. Electronic updates are also
available.

6.6. Map Reading at Night. At night, unlighted landmarks may be difficult or impossible to see. Lights
can be confusing because they appear closer than they really are. Fixing on points other than those
directly beneath the aircraft is very difficult. Objects may be more easily seen by scanning or looking at
them indirectly to eliminate the eye's visual blindspot. Preserve your night vision by working with red or
green light, being aware that red light can detract from the chart color. Moonlight makes it possible to
see prominent landmarks like land-water contrast. Reflected moonlight often causes a river or lake to
stand out brightly for a moment, but this condition is usually too brief for accurate fixing. Roads and
railroads may be seen after the eyes are accustomed to the darkness. Lighted landmarks, such as cities
and towns, stand out more clearly at night than in daytime. Large cities can often be recognized by their
distinctive shapes. Many small towns are dark at night and are not visible to the unaided eye. Night
vision goggles dramatically enhance map reading in dark areas. Some airfields have distinctive light
patterns and may be used as checkpoints. Military fields use a double white and single green rotating
beacon, while civilian fields use a single white and single green rotating beacon. Busy highways are
discernible because of automobile headlights.

6.7. Estimating Distance. A landmark often falls right or left of course and the navigator must estimate
the distance to it. While the ability to estimate distance from a landmark rests largely in skill and
experience, the following methods may be of assistance. One method is to compare the distance to a
landmark with the distance between two other points as measured on the chart. Another method, shown
in Figure 6.3, is to estimate the angle between the aircraft subpoint and the line of sight. The distance in
NM from the landmark to the subpoint of the aircraft depends on the sighting angle:
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                    171

Figure 6.3. Estimating Distances.




6.7.1. (60o) horizontal distance = absolute altitude of aircraft X 1.7.

6.7.2. (45o) horizontal distance = absolute altitude of aircraft.

6.7.3. (30o) horizontal distance = absolute altitude of aircraft X .6.

6.8. Seasonal Changes. Seasonal changes can conceal landmarks or change their appearance. Small
lakes and rivers may dry up during the summer. Their outlines may change considerably during the wet
season. Snow can cover up almost all of the normally used landmarks. When flying in the winter, it is
often necessary to rely on more prominent checkpoints, such as river bends, hills, or larger towns.
However, due to the size of these checkpoints, course control can be somewhat degraded.

6.9. Map Reading in High Latitudes. Map reading in high latitudes is considerably more difficult than
map reading in the lower latitudes. The nature of the terrain is drastically different, charts are less
detailed and less precise, seasonal changes may alter the terrain appearance or hide it completely from
view, and there are fewer cultural features.

6.9.1. In high latitudes, navigators find few distinguishable features from which to determine a position.
Built-up features are practically nonexistent. The few which do exist are closely grouped, offering little
help to the navigator flying long navigation legs. Natural features which do exist are in limited variety
and are difficult to distinguish from each other. Lakes seem endless in number and identical in
appearance. The countless inlets are extremely difficult to identify, particularly in winter. What appears
172                                                                 AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

to be land may in reality be floating ice, the shape of which can change from day to day. Recognizable,
reliable checkpoints are few and far between.

6.9.2. Map reading in high latitudes is further complicated by inadequate charting. Some polar areas are
yet to be thoroughly surveyed. The charts portray the appearance of general locales, but many individual
terrain features are merely approximated or omitted entirely. In place of detailed outlines of lakes, for
example, charts often carry the brief annotationâ€”many lakes. Fixing is possible, but requires extended
effort and keen judgment on your part.

6.9.3. When snow blankets the terrain from horizon to horizon, navigation by map reading becomes
acutely difficult. Coastal ice becomes indistinguishable from the land, coastal contours appear radically
changed, and many inlets, streams, and lakes disappear. Blowing snow may extend to heights of 200 to
300 feet and may continue for several days, but visibility is usually excellent in the absence of
interfering clouds or ice crystal haze. However, when snow obliterates surface features and the sky is
covered with a uniform layer of clouds so that no shadows are cast, the horizon disappears, causing earth
and sky to blend together. This forms an unbroken expanse of white called whiteout. In this complete
lack of contrast, distance and height above ground are virtually impossible to estimate. Whiteout is
particularly prevalent in northern Alaska during late winter and spring. The continuous darkness of night
presents another hazard; nevertheless, surface features are often visible because the snow is an excellent
reflector of light from the moon, the stars, and the aurora.

6.10. Contour Map Reading. Use of contours is the most common method of showing relief features
on a chart. Contours are lines that, at certain intervals, connect points of equal elevation. To understand
contours better, think of the zero contour line to be sea level. If the sea were to rise 10 feet, the new
shoreline would be the 10-foot contour line. Similarly, successive 10-foot contour lines could be easily
determined. Contour lines are closer together where the slope is steep and farther apart where the slope
is gentle. Within the limits of the contour intervals, the height of points and the angle of slope can also
be determined from the chart. Refer to Figure 1.32 for an illustration of the use of contour lines.

6.10.1. Contour intervals are determined by the scale of the chart, the amount of relief, and the accuracy
of the survey. These intervals may range from 1 foot on a large-scale chart through 2,000 feet or greater
on a smaller scale chart. Contours may be annotated in feet or meters. Contours may be shown on charts
in varying colors and are frequently labeled with figures of elevation. To further accentuate the terrain, a
gradient system of coloring is also employed. The lighter colors are used to show lower areas while a
gradual increase in density (darkness) is used to portray the higher terrain.

6.10.2. Military operations require the analysis of contour-labeled charts to visualize the land. In
operational planning, this is of the utmost importance, whether it is planning a route for a safe flight or
in determining the best escape from enemy territory.

6.11. Summary. Map reading is a critical skill for navigators in many aircraft, but it takes time to
become proficient. Keep a good DR, work from chart to ground, and remember the effect varying
conditions have on what you see outside your window.

                                         RADAR NAVIGATION

Section 7Aâ€”Radar Principles

7.1. Introduction. In the hands of the skilled operator, radar provides precise updates to dead reckoning
(DR) for navigation and airborne delivery operators. At cruising altitudes, it provides information on
land and water characteristics as well as hazardous weather conditions over hundreds of miles around
the aircraft. At low-level, it provides detailed terrain information used to navigate at high speed over
changing courses. It is adapted to terrain-avoidance and terrain-following equipment. Radar is a source
of track and drift angle (DA) information for wind computations and can be used with beacons for
intercept, rendezvous, airdrop, and bombing operations.

7.1.1. The basis of the system has been known theoretically since the time of Heinrich Hertz who, in
1888, successfully demonstrated the transfer of electromagnetic energy in space and showed that such
energy is capable of reflection. The transmission of electromagnetic energy between two points was
developed as radio, but it was not until 1922 that practical use of the reflection properties of such energy
was conceived. The idea of measuring the elapsed time between the transmission of a radio signal and
receipt of its reflected echo from a surface originated nearly simultaneously in the United States and
England. In the United States, two scientists working with air-to-ground signals noticed that ships
moving in the nearby Potomac River distorted the pattern of these signals. In 1925, the same scientists
were able to measure the time required for a short burst, or pulse, of radio energy to travel to the
ionosphere and return. Following this success, it was realized the radar principle could be applied to the
detection of other objects, including ships and aircraft.

7.1.2. By the beginning of World War II, the Army and Navy had developed equipment appropriate to
their respective fields. During and following the war, the rapid advance in theory and technological skill
brought improvements and additional applications of the early equipment. It is now possible to measure
accurately the distance and direction of a reflecting surface in space, whether it is an aircraft, a ship, a
hurricane, or a prominent feature of the terrain, even under conditions of darkness or restricted visibility.
For these reasons, radar has become a valuable navigational tool.

7.1.3. As noted previously, the fundamental principle of radar may be likened to that of relating sound to
its echo. Thus, a ship sometimes determines its distance from a cliff at the water's edge by blowing its
whistle and timing the interval until the echo is received. The same principle applies to radar, which uses
the reflected echo of electromagnetic radiation traveling at the speed of light. This speed is
approximately 162,000 NM per second; it may also be expressed as 985 feet per microsecond. If the
interval between the transmission of the signal and return of the echo is 200 microseconds, the distance
to the target is:




Section 7Bâ€”Radar Set Components

7.2. Overview. The principle of radar is accomplished by developing a pulse of microwave energy that
is transmitted from the aircraft and is reflected by objects in its path. The reflected pulse is amplified and
174                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

converted by the receiver for display on the cathode-ray tube (CRT). The timing unit or synchronizer
synchronizes all the actions in the set. To this basic unit, improvements are added for special purposes,
such as weather avoidance, filtering, and terrain following.

7.3. Components:

7.3.1. The receiver and transmitter are usually one unit (the R/T) with separate functions that, for this
description, are dealt with separately (Figure 7.1).


Figure 7.1. Radar System Components.




7.3.2. The transmitter produces the radio frequency (RF) energy using magnetrons. A magnetron
generates radar pulses by bunching electrons using alternately charged grids the electrons travel past.
The spurts of energy are of high power and short duration. The energy is released at intervals (the pulse
recurrence rate) determined by the selected operating range.

7.3.3. The generated pulse travels through either coaxial cable or, more frequently, a hollow tube called
the wave guide. The wave guide requires pressurization to ensure the maintenance of conditions for
proper microwave conduction. The energy passes an electronic switching device that directs outgoing
pulses to the antenna and incoming pulses from the antenna to the receiver.

7.3.4. The antenna is a parabolic dish with a protruding wave guide. It is gimbal-mounted to allow
rotation of the dish and, in most cases, to allow stabilization of the dish relative to the earth's surface
when the aircraft turns. Rotation of the antenna could be through 360o or in a sector (either variable or
preset). The 360o rotation, or scan, is usually for mapping; whereas, a sector is used in aircraft with
limited space for the antenna or where the intent is to concentrate energy in a small area.

7.3.5. The antenna assembly will be either permanently locked to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft
(boresighted) or only so aligned when stabilization units are inactive. When not caged, the antenna
stabilization is accomplished by using gyroservo mechanisms. A sensor system that provides
information to a computer keeps the antenna radiation plane parallel to the earth even when the aircraft
is in a climb or a bank.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       175

7.3.5.1. There are two radiation patterns popular in airborne radar design, fan and pencil beams. The fan
beam is a wide pattern that distributes the RF energy across the beam in proportion to the distance it
must travel (Figure 7.2). The fan beam is best for general mapping. To concentrate the energy emitted,
the pencil beam antenna is used. The pencil beam dish allows scanning for weather or aircraft while
eliminating ground clutter. It can be used to put more energy on a section of ground to increase returns.

Figure 7.2. Antenna Radiation Patterns.




7.3.5.2. The antenna can be manipulated to aim the emissions through a control that tilts the dish from
the horizontal plane. At cruising altitudes, in the mapping mode, it is sufficient to slightly tilt the dish
down, but tilt should be constantly adjusted for optimum returns.

7.3.6. After transmission, the reflected energy is directed back to the wave guide where it travels past the
switching device which directs the returns to the receiver. The receiver converts the microwave returns
to electrical signals that are amplified and sent to a CRT called the planned position indicator (PPI). The
amplification of the returns is controllable through a gain circuit. Depending on the type of return
desired on the PPI, the operator adjusts the receiver gain. Other booster circuits, such as sweep intensity
or video gain, are available, but operation of the receiver is most important. If adequate receiver
amplification of weak returns is not applied, no amount of later stage adjustments will put the target on
the scope.

7.3.7. The PPI, or scope, offers both range and azimuth information about targets to the operator. This
information is relative to the aircraft's position which can be referenced at either the center of the scope
or offset to the side of the screen (Figure 7.3). The PPI is a CRT with focusing coils and a deflection
coil. The deflection coil is an electromagnet whose variable field manipulates the electron beam so that
returns can be presented on the scope in their correct position relative to the observer (Figure 7.4).

7.3.8. Applying a polarization to the signals going to the CRT produces the actual presentation of the
return. The null return has a predominantly positive charge; therefore, the trace is suppressed. A
polarization shift is produced in the current to produce a blooming of the trace corresponding to the
strength and position of the received signal.

7.3.9. Range is determined by the travel time of a pulse from and back to the R/T unit. Knowing that RF
energy travels at the constant speed of light, range determination is simple. The synchronizer
coordinates its display on the PPI.
176                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 7.3. Sector Scan Displays.




Figure 7.4. Electromagnetic Cathode Ray Tube.




7.3.10. At the same instant that the timer triggers the transmitter, it also sends a trigger signal to the
indicator. Here, a circuit is actuated which causes the current in the deflection coils to rise at a linear
(uniform) rate. The rising current, in turn, causes the spot to be deflected radially outward from the
center of the scope. The spot thus traces a faint line on the scope; this line is called the sweep. If no echo
is received, the intensity of the sweep remains uniform throughout its entire length. However, if an echo
is returned, it is so applied to the CRT that it intensifies the spot and momentarily brightens a segment of
the sweep relative to the size of the target. Since the sweep is linear and begins with the emission of the
transmitted pulse, the point at which the echo brightens the sweep will be an indication of the range to
the object causing the echo.

7.3.11. The progressive positions of the pulse in space also indicate the corresponding positions of the
electron beam as it sweeps across the face of the CRT. If the radius of the scope represents 40 miles and
the return appears at three-quarters of the distance from the center of the scope to its periphery, the
target is represented as being about 30 miles away.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                        177

7.3.12. In the preceding example, the radar is set for 40-mile range operation. The sweep circuits will
thus operate only for an equivalent time interval so that targets beyond 40 miles will not appear on the
scope. The time equivalent to 40 miles of radar range is only 496 microseconds (496 X 10-6 seconds).
Thus, 496 microseconds after a pulse is transmitted (plus an additional period of perhaps 100
microseconds to allow the sweep circuits to recover) the radar is ready to transmit the next pulse. The
actual pulse repetition rate in this example is about 800 pulses per second. The return will, therefore,
appear in virtually the same position along the sweep as each successive pulse is transmitted, even
though the aircraft and the target are moving at appreciable speeds.

7.3.13. At times, the PPI will not display targets across the entire range selected on the scope. In these
cases, atmospheric refraction and the line of sight (LOS) characteristics of radar energy have affected
the effective range of the set. The following formula can determine the radar's range in these situations
where D is distance and h is the aircraft altitude:



7.3.14. Azimuth measurement is achieved by synchronizing the deflection coil with the antenna. In the
basic radar unit, when the antenna is pointed directly off the nose of the aircraft, the deflection coils are
aligned to fire the trace at the 12 o'clock position on the scope. As the antenna rotates, the deflection coil
moves at the same rate. Relative target presentations are displayed as the sweep rotation is combined
with the range display.

Section 7Câ€”Scope Interpretation

7.4. Basics. The PPI presents a map-like picture of the terrain below and around the aircraft. Just as map
reading skill is largely dependent upon the ability to correlate what is seen on the ground with the
symbols on the chart, so the art of scope presentation analysis is largely dependent upon the ability to
correlate what is seen on the scope with the chart symbols. Application of the concept of radar reflection
and an understanding of how received signals are displayed on the PPI are prerequisites to scope
interpretation. Furthermore, knowledge of these factors applied in reverse enables the navigator to
predict the probable radarscope appearance of any area.

7.5. Factors Affecting Reflection. A target's ability to reflect energy is based on the target's
composition, size, and the radar beam's angle of reflection (Figure 7.5). The range of the target from the
aircraft is definitive in the quantity of returned energy. The range of a target produces an inverse effect
on the target's radar cross-section. And there will be some atmospheric attenuation of the pulse
proportional to the distance that the energy must travel. Generally, all four factors contribute to the
displayed return. A single factor can, in some cases, either prevent a target from reflecting sufficient
energy for detection or cause a disproportionate excess of reflected energy to be received and displayed.
The following are general rules of radarscope interpretation:

7.5.1. The greatest return potential exists when the radar beam forms a horizontal right angle with the
frontal portion of the reflector.

7.5.2. Radar return potential is roughly proportional to the target size and the reflective properties
(density) of the target.
178                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 7.5. Relative Reflectivity of Structural Materials.




7.5.3. Radar return potential is greatest within the zone of the greatest radiation pattern of the antenna.

7.5.4. Radar return potential decreases as altitude increases because the vertical reflection angle becomes
more and more removed from the optimum. (There are many exceptions to this general rule since there
are many structures that may present better reflection from roof surfaces than from frontal surfaces or in
the case of weather.)

7.5.5. Radar return potential decreases as range increases because of the greater beam width at long
ranges and because of atmospheric attenuation.

NOTE: All of the factors affecting reflection must be considered to determine the radar return potential.

7.6. Typical Radar Returns:

7.6.1. Returns From Land. All land surfaces present minute irregular parts of the total surface for
reflection of the radar beam; thus, there is usually a certain amount of radar return from all land areas.
The amount of return varies considerably according to the nature of the land surface scanned. This
variance is caused by the difference in reflecting materials of which the land area is composed and the
texture of the land surface. These are the primary factors governing the total radar return from specific
land areas.

7.6.2. Flat Land. A certain amount of any surface, however flat in the overall view, is irregular enough
to reflect the radar beam. Surfaces which are apparently flat are actually textured and may cause returns
on the scope. Ordinary soil absorbs some of the radar energy and, thus, the return that emanates from
this type of surface is not strong. Irregularly textured land areas present more surface to the radar beam
than flat land and, thus, causes more return. The returns from irregularly textured land areas are most
intense when the radar beam scans the ridges or similar features at a right angle. This effect is
particularly helpful in detecting riverbeds, gullies, or other sharp breaks in the surface height. At times,
in desolate areas that are flat, these occasional surface changes are apparent where it would not have
appeared in more irregular topography. Such returns provide recognizable targets in otherwise sparse
circumstances. In other cases, especially at low-level over broken terrain, this effect could complicate
scope interpretation.

7.6.3. Hills and Mountains. Hills and mountains will normally give more radar returns than flat land
because the radar beam is more nearly perpendicular to the sides of these features. The typical return is a
bright return from the near side of the feature and an area of no return on the far side. The area of no
return, called a mountain shadow, exists because the radar beam cannot penetrate the mountain and its
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      179

LOS transmission does not allow it to intercept targets behind the mountain (Figure 7.6). The shadow
area will vary in size, depending upon the height of the aircraft with respect to the mountain. As an
aircraft approaches a mountain, the shadow area becomes smaller at higher altitudes. Furthermore, the
shape of the shadow area and the brightness of the return from the peak will vary as the aircraft's
position changes. As the aircraft closes on the mountainous area, shadows may disappear completely as
the beam covers the entire surface area. At this point, a great deal of energy is reflected back at the
antenna and recognizable features in that area will be rare.


Figure 7.6. Mountain Shadows.




7.6.3.1. Recognition of mountain shadow is important because any target in the area behind the
mountain cannot be seen on the scope. In areas with isolated high peaks or mountain ridges, contour
navigation may be possible because the returns from such features assume an almost three-dimensional
appearance. This allows specific peaks to be identified.

7.6.3.2. In more rugged mountainous areas, however, there may be so many mountains with resulting
return and shadow areas that contour navigation is almost impossible. But these mountainous areas are
composed of patches of mountains or hills, each having different relative sizes and shapes and relative
positions from other patches. By observing these relationships on a chart, general aircraft positioning is
feasible.

7.6.4. Coastlines and Riverbanks. The contrast between water and land is very sharp, so that the
configuration of coasts and lakes are seen with map-like clarity in most cases (Figure 7.7). When the
radar beam scans the banks of a river, lake, or larger body of water, there is little or no return from the
water surface itself, but there is usually a return from the adjoining land. The more rugged the bank or
180                                                                AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

coastline, the more returns will be experienced. In cases where there are wide, smooth mud flats or
sandy beaches, the exact definition of the coastline will require careful tuning.


Figure 7.7. Radar Returns.




7.6.4.1. Since both mountains and lakes present a dark area on the scope, it is sometimes easy to mistake
a mountain shadow for a lake. This is particularly true when navigating in mountainous areas that also
contain lakes.

7.6.4.2. One difference between returns from mountain areas and lakes is that returns from mountains
are bright on the near side and dark on the far side, while returns from lakes are of more uniform
brightness all around the edges. Another characteristic of mountain returns is that the no-show area
changes its shape and position quite rapidly as the aircraft moves; returns from lakes change
inconsequentially.

7.6.5. Cultural Returns. The overall size and shape of the radar return from any given city can usually
be determined with a fair degree of accuracy by referring to a current map of the area (Figure 7.7).
However, the brightness of one cultural area as compared to another may vary greatly and this variance
can hardly be forecasted by reference to the navigation chart. In general, due to the collection of dense
materials therein, urban and suburban areas generate strong returns, although the industrial and
commercial centers of the cities produce a much greater brightness than the outlying residential areas.
Many isolated or small groups of structures create radar returns. The size and brightness of the radar
returns these features produce are dependent on their construction. If these structures are not plotted on
the navigation charts, they are of no navigational value. However, some of them give very strong
returns, such as large concrete dams, steel bridges, etc.; and, if any are plotted on the chart and can be
properly identified, they can provide valuable navigational assistance.

7.6.6. Weather Returns. Cloud returns that appear on the scope are of interest for two reasons. First,
since the brightness of a given cloud return is an indication of the intensity of the weather within the
cloud, intense weather areas can be avoided by directing the pilot through the areas of least intensity or
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                    181

by circumnavigating the entire cloud return (Figure 7.8). Second, cloud returns obscure useful natural
and cultural features on the ground. They may also be falsely identified as a ground feature, which can
lead to gross errors in radar fixing. Clouds must be reasonably large to create a return on the scope.
However, size alone is not the sole determining factor. The one really important characteristic that
causes clouds to create radar returns is the size of the water droplets forming them. Radar waves are
reflected from large rain droplets and hail which fall through the atmosphere or are suspended in the
clouds by strong vertical air currents. Thunderstorms are characterized by strong vertical air currents;
therefore, they give very strong radar returns. Cloud returns may be identified as follows:


Figure 7.8. Weather Returns.




7.6.6.1. Brightness varies considerably, but the average brightness is greater than a normal ground
return.

7.6.6.2. Returns generally present a hazy, fuzzy appearance around their edges.

7.6.6.3. Returns often produce shadow areas similar to mountain shadows because the radar beam does
not penetrate clouds completely.

7.6.6.4. Returns do not fade away as the antenna tilt is raised, but ground returns do tend to decrease in
intensity with an increase in antenna tilt.

7.6.6.5. Returns can appear in the altitude hole when altitude delay is not used and the distance to the
cloud is less than the altitude.

7.6.7. Effects of Snow and Ice:

7.6.7.1. The effects of snow and ice are similar to the effect of water.
182                                                                 AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

7.6.7.2. If a land area is covered to any great depth with snow: (1) some of the radar beam will reflect
from the snow and (2) some of the energy will be absorbed by the snow. The overall effect is to reduce
the return that would normally come from the snow-blanketed area.

7.6.7.3. Ice will react in a slightly different manner, depending upon its roughness. If an ice coating on a
body of water remains smooth, the return will appear approximately the same as a water return.
However, if the ice is formed in irregular patterns, the returns created will be comparable to terrain
features of commensurate size. For example, ice ridges or ice mountains would create returns
comparable to ground embankments or mountains, respectively. Also, offshore ice floes tend to disguise
the true shape of a coastline so that the coastline may appear vastly different in winter as compared to
summer. This phenomenon is termed arctic reversal because the resultant PPI display will often be the
opposite of the anticipated display.

7.7. Inherent Scope Errors. Another factor which must be considered in radarscope interpretation is
the inherent distortion of the radar display. This distortion is present to a greater or lesser degree in
every radar set, depending upon its design. Inherent scope errors may be attributed to three causes: width
of beam, the length (time duration) of the transmitted pulse, and the diameter of the electron spot.

7.7.1. Beam-Width Error. Beam-width error is not overly significant in radar navigation (although it
must be taken into account in radar bombing). Since the distortion is essentially symmetrical, it may be
nullified by bisecting the return with the bearing cursor when a bearing is measured. Reducing the
receiver gain control also lessens beam-width distortion.

7.7.2. Pulse-Length Error. Pulse-length error is caused by the fact that the radar transmission is not
instantaneous but lasts for a brief period of time. There is a distortion in the range depiction on the far
side of the reflector and this pulse-length error is equal to the range equivalent of one-half of the pulse
time. Since pulse length error occurs on the far side of the return, it may be nullified by reading the
range to, and plotting from, the near side of a reflecting target when taking radar ranges.

7.7.3. Spot-Size Error. Spot-size error is caused by the fact that the electron beam which displays the
returns on the scope has a definite physical diameter. No return which appears on the scope can be
smaller than the diameter of the beam. Furthermore, a part of the glow produced when the electron beam
strikes the phosphorescent coating of the CRT radiates laterally across the scope. As a result of these
two factors, all returns displayed on the scope will appear to be slightly larger in size than they actually
are. Spot-size distortion may be reduced by using the lowest practicable receiver gain, video gain, and
bias settings and by keeping the operating range at a minimum so that the area represented by each spot
is kept at a minimum. Further, the operator should check the focus control for optimum setting.

7.7.4. Total Distortion. For navigational purposes, these errors are often negligible. However, the radar
navigator should realize that they do exist and that optimum radar accuracy demands that they be taken
into account. They are usually most significant when the target is a thin, no-show (river), when it is very
reflective but small, or when it is in close proximity to another show target. Thin no-shows are erased
except for their wider points. With tiny but very reflective targets, the cross-section of the return would
normally be negligible on the PPI. Their extremely strong reflectance, coupled with the inherent errors,
causes them to appear larger and of seemingly more significance on the indicator. When show targets
are close to each other, these errors will cause them to blend together, thus, diminishing the scope
resolution. Generally, the combined effects of the inherent errors cause reflecting targets to appear larger
and nonreflecting targets to dwindle (Figure 7.9).
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                         183

Section 7Dâ€”Radar Enhancements

7.8. Basics. The airborne radar sets used throughout the Air Force vary slightly in the navigational
refinements offered. The following is a description of enhancements designed to overcome some of the
common problems encountered in radar navigation.

7.9. Variable Range Marker and Crosshairs. Most radar sets provide a range marker that may be
moved within certain limits by the radar operator. This variable range marker permits more accurate
measurement of range because the marker can be positioned more accurately on the scope. Furthermore,
visual interpolation of range is simplified when using the variable range marker. On many radar sets, an
electronic azimuth marker has been added to the variable range marker to facilitate fixing. The
intersection of the azimuth marker and the variable range marker is defined as radar crosshairs.

7.10. Altitude Delay. It is obvious that the ground directly beneath the aircraft is the closest reflecting
object. Therefore, the first return that can appear on the scope will be from this ground point. Since it
takes some finite period of time for the radar pulses to travel to the ground and back, it follows that the
sweep must travel some finite distance radially from the center of the scope before it displays the first
return. Consequently, a hole will appear in the center of the scope within which no ground returns can
appear. Since the size of this hole is proportional to altitude, its radius can be used to estimate altitude. If
the radius of the altitude hole is 12,000 feet, the absolute altitude of the aircraft is about 12,000 feet.

7.10.1. Although the altitude hole may be used to estimate altitude, it occupies a large portion of the
scope face, especially when the aircraft is flying at a high altitude and using a short range. This may be
seen in Figure 7.10. In this particular case, the range selector switch is set for a 50/10-mile range
presentation. Without altitude delay, the return shown on the inside part of the scope consists of the
altitude hole and the return shown on the remaining part is a badly distorted presentation of all of the
terrain below the aircraft.

7.10.2. Many radar sets incorporate an altitude delay circuit which permits the removal of the altitude
hole. This is accomplished by delaying the start of the sweep until the radar pulse has had time to travel
to the ground point directly below the aircraft and back. Hence, the name altitude delay circuit. The
altitude delay circuit also minimizes distortion and makes it possible for the radarscope to present a
ground picture which preserves the actual relationships between the various ground objects.
184                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 7.10. Altitude Delay Eliminates the Hole.




7.11. Sweep Delay. Sweep delay is a feature which delays the start of the sweep until after the radar
pulse has had time to travel some distance into space. In this respect, it is very similar to altitude delay.
The use of sweep delay enables the radar operator to obtain an enlarged view of areas at extended
ranges. For example, two targets that are 75 miles from the aircraft can only be displayed on the scope if
a range scale greater than 75 miles is being used. On the 100-mile range scale, the two targets might
appear very small and close together. By introducing 50 miles of sweep delay, the display of the two
targets will be enlarged (Figure 7.11). The more this range is reduced, the greater will be the enlarging
effect. On some sets, the range displayed during sweep delay operation is fixed by the design of the set
and cannot be adjusted by the operator.


Figure 7.11. Sweep Delay Provides Telescopic View.




7.12. Iso-Echo. Detecting hazardous weather is not difficult in the normal mapping mode with most
radar units. The weather mode offers increased sensitivity to weather phenomenon. But to discriminate
between areas of varying hazards presents a dilemma. Reflected energy from weather is dependent on
the density of the rain and hail it contains. The limitations of PPI capabilities to display these dynamic
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        185

characteristics make detection of the more intense areas difficult. Also, computer circuitry is more
effective at judging slight variations in shading than the human eye.

7.12.1. The iso-echo control compensates for this deficiency by presenting a void area on the PPI
corresponding to a hazardous area in the weather environment. This void area, the black hole, is
dependent on a control that the operator sets to define the intensity of the area that is to be avoided. For
instance, say only the largest cells of weather are desired to be displayed. The operator would set the
appropriate control and, on the PPI, the weather depiction would be present. The areas within the
weather where the most hazardous cells were located would be no-show areas or black holes.

7.12.2. The iso-echo circuits are capable of sensing the variation in the received signals and act like a
radio squelch control to block presentation of selected intensities (Figure 7.12). A word of caution! Iso-
echo is not selective in the targets it will block. If ground returns are received by the radar and a portion
of their intensity falls into the range selected to be blocked, they too will be blocked from the scope.


Figure 7.12. Iso-Echo.




7.13. Radar Beacon. Radar beacons have been used for many years in air-to-ground operations. In the
past, airfields had beacons visible on radar much like a nondirectional beacon (NDB) but most are now
decommissioned. Aircraft IFF-SIF transponders are the outgrowth of this earlier equipment. Radar
beacons are still used in air-to-air operations by Air Mobility and Air Combat Commands for types of
rendezvous.

7.13.1. Radar beacons consist of interrogator and responder units operating from different locations. The
interrogator transmits a pulse that causes the responder to transmit a corresponding pulse. The
interrogator receives the coded return and uses time lapse and azimuth or sweep relationships to display
the returns on the PPI. The time needed for generation of the return pulse causes a range error
amounting to one half mile, generally.

7.13.2. Beacons are sometimes coded with a mixture of aircraft identification and flight parameters for
ARTCC. Aircraft equipped with beacons like the APN-69 can interrogate and respond to like-equipped
aircraft. Beacons like the APN-69 use a pulsed code of up to six pulses. The pulse codes are set by the
responder aircraft and will appear on the interrogators PPI. The first pulse will be in the relative position
of the responder with successive pulses trailing. The range between aircraft is equal to the range of the
first pulse (minus one half NM) and the azimuth is measured through the middle of the pulse length.
186                                                                AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

7.13.3. Two blocking circuits are included in the units to prevent interference from radar on other
frequencies or a return of the interrogating pulse. This sometimes prevents a ring around where false
azimuth inputs are presented on the PPI. In such cases, excessive gain causes returns to be picked up by
side lobes of the antenna. Figure 7.13 is an example of a beacon return on the scope.


Figure 7.13. Radar Beacon Returns.




7.14. Sensitivity Time Constant (STC). Most radar sets produce a hot spot in the center of the
radarscope because the high-gain setting required to amplify the weak echoes of distant targets
overamplifies the strong echoes of nearby targets. If the receiver gain setting is reduced sufficiently to
eliminate the hot spot, distant returns are weakened or eliminated entirely. The difficulty is most
pronounced when radar is used during low-level navigation; to make best use of the radar, the navigator
is forced to adjust the receiver gain setting constantly. STC solves the problem by increasing the gain as
the electron beam is deflected from the center to the edge of the radarscope, automatically providing an
optimum gain setting for each range displayed. In this manner, the hot spot is removed while distant
targets are amplified sufficiently. STC controls vary from one model radar set to another. Refer to the
appropriate technical order for operating instructions.

7.15. Terrain Avoidance Radar. Terrain avoidance radar gives the aircrew an all-weather, low-level
capability. As mentioned earlier, interpreting mountain shadows on a normal radarscope can be
confusing. There is no time for indecision at low altitudes and at high speeds. Terrain avoidance
increases safety and eliminates confusion by displaying only those vertical obstructions that project
above a selected clearance plane. The two basic types of presentation used with terrain avoidance are
illustrated in Figure 7.14.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       187

Figure 7.14. Terrain Avoidance Radar Presentations.




7.15.1. Plan Display. The plan display is a sector scan presentation that indicates the range and direction
of obstructions projecting above a selected clearance plane. The clearance plane can be manually set at
any level from 3,000 feet below the aircraft up to the level of the aircraft. Only those peaks projecting
above the clearance plane are displayed; all other returns are inconsequential and are eliminated. The
sector scan presentation limits the returns to those ahead of the aircraft. The vertical line represents the
ground track of the aircraft and ranges are determined by range marks (Figure 7.14).
188                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

7.15.2. Profile Display. The profile display, normally received only by the pilot, provides an outline of
the terrain 1,500 feet above and below the clearance plane. Elevations of returns are represented
vertically; azimuth is represented horizontally. This display gives the operator a look up the valley. The
returns seen represent the highest terrain within the selected range. The position of the aircraft is
represented by an aircraft symbol on the indicator overlay. Figure 7.14 shows both a 3-mile and a 6-mile
presentation.

7.16. Array Radars. The family of array radars include phased, planar, and synthetic aperture. These
systems differ significantly from conventional radars. A typical radar uses the shape of the antenna to
focus radiated energy. In contrast, an array electronically shapes the beam through a process of
constructive and destructive interference. The planar array, found on most modern fighters,
electronically focuses the energy and then mechanically scans the antenna through space. A true phased
array system, like the air defense Patriot missile, both focuses and steers the beam electronically. The
synthetic aperture array simulates a large antenna by summing the target return over time. Phased array
radar has applications in ground mapping and precise weapons employment. All arrays have the
advantage of few moving parts, very rapid updates and the ability to track and engage multiple targets.
The disadvantages include cost, complexity, and computer dependency.

7.17. Techniques on Radar Usage. Radars currently in use offer variations of special equipment and
capabilities. The following are techniques to use with radar in common situations and with special
equipment designed to enhance radar usage. These are basic suggestions that can and should be adapted
to specific aircraft and mission requirements.

7.18. Radar Fixing. Techniques in radar fixing change from operator to operator and most provide
accurate results. The following are reminders that will affect the fix accuracy if not considered.

7.18.1. Radar is an aid to DR. Before any radar return can be accurately identified, the operator should
be familiar with a chart of the target area. This chart study relies on knowing the approximate location of
the aircraft and, therefore, it is essential to radar fixing that the best possible DR position is ascertained.

7.18.2. In examining the area surrounding the DR on the chart, attention should be given to details like
roadways and waterways as well as the more prominent urban returns. Cultural returns build up along
such byways; therefore, discrepancies between the chart (which could be years old) and the PPI display
can be more successfully analyzed.

7.18.3. Prior to fixing, take care to adjust gain, antenna tilt, and heading marker. If you use a mechanical
cursor, ensure its center is aligned with the sweep origin, or risk parallax error. Do not accept a return on
the scope as the chosen target unless you've verified it using surrounding returns. Work from chart to
scope. If your desired target does not show but you see a return you think you recognize, go back to the
chart and verify it before fixing from it.

7.18.4. When obtaining fix readings, remember to compensate for inherent scope errors. If the fix is a
multirange or multibearing type, choose the targets to provide the optimum cut. When using multiple
targets, read the returns that are changing their values the fastest closest to fix time. (With multirange, a
target off the nose changes range faster than the one off the wing.)
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                         189

7.19. Slant Range. Once you identify a return, use it to fix the position of the aircraft by measuring its
bearing and distance from a known geographical point. Of particular significance in any discussion of
radar ranging is the subject of slant range versus ground range (Figure 7.l5). Slant range is the straight-
line distance between the aircraft and the target, while ground range is the range between the point
directly below the aircraft and the target.


Figure 7.15. Slant Range Compared to Ground Range.




7.19.1. To fix the position of the aircraft, the navigator is interested in the ground range from the fixing
point, yet the fixed range markers give slant range. The trick is to determine the critical range below
which the navigator must convert slant range to ground range to keep fixes accurate. This range may be
determined by a simple formula:

         Critical slant range = Absolute Altitude (in K)-5

7.19.2. Slant range can be converted to ground range, using the latitude and longitude lines of a chart if
the slant range table is not available. Set dividers at the slant range distance to the target. Place one point
of the dividers at the equivalent (in NM) of the aircraft's altitude on the longitude line. Set the other
point where it meets a nearby latitude line. Without moving point, reset the first point along the latitude
line at the intersection of the latitude and longitude lines. The distance is the ground range in NM
(Figure 7.16). Slant range correction charts are provided in Figures 7.17.

7.20. Side Lobe Interference. Side lobes are small extra fields of energy separate from the main beam,
and are an inherent flaw in any radar. These side lobes are rarely strong enough to generate a return.
However, when a large or very reflective target comes into this field or when the transmitter power
increases the size of the lobes, multiple shadow returns may appear on the PPI. Curved strobes
originating at the center of the radarscope are also caused by the side lobes of the radar receiving energy
from your radar or others in the same frequency range. Solutions to this problem include reducing the
gain or changing transmitter frequencies.
190                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 7.17. Slant Range Correction Chart.




7.21. Target-Timing Wind. This is a technique for obtaining a wind by using radar targets to provide
track and GS of an aircraft. The MB-4 computer solution for wind requires true heading (TH), true
airspeed (TAS), drift angle (DA), and GS. The first two can be derived from basic aircraft instruments
(indicated airspeed [IAS] and compass). The other two require a target which can be tracked for about 4
minutes and which is preferably within 20 degrees of the radar heading marker. The identity of the target
is irrelevant, but it should not be too big to make range and bearing determination vague, or so small that
it will disappear. Choose a target that has just appeared on the scope and read its range and bearing.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        191

Also, start a stopwatch or note the minute and seconds on a clock so elapsed time can be measured. At
least two ranges and bearings should be taken over a distance of 20 to 25 NM. One technique is to fix at
the 40, 30, and 20 NM range marks to space the fixes evenly. At the last observation, stop the watch and
determine the elapsed time. On the windface grid of the MB-4, place the grommet over the center mark
of the top reference line. Turn the compass rose to the azimuth of the first fix. Using your own values for
each of the horizontal grid lines, plot a point representing the range of the first fix (going down). Then,
turn the compass rose to the azimuth of the second fix and plot a point (measuring from the top line
again) representing the range of the second fix. Repeat for the successive fixes (Figure 7.18). To solve
for the wind, rotate the compass rose so that the three plotted lines are parallel to the vertical grid lines
and read the track under the true index of the compass rose. Then, determine the GS by measuring the
distance between the first and last plotted points using the grid lines. Using track and TH, find the DA
and use the standard MB-4 wind solution.

 EXAMPLE:
        TH = 320o                          Fix 1           310o            40 NM
        TAS = 400 knots                    Fix 2           308o            30 NM
        Time = 3 + 30 min                  Fix 3           305o            20 NM
        Solution:
        TC = 316o
        GS = 352 knots
        Wind = 349o/53 knots

7.22. Airborne Radar Approach (ARA). The ARA is as a ground controlled approach in reverse. It is
an alternate procedure in marginal weather conditions, normally when no other approach is available.
However, navigators should practice often to prepare for the time when it is the only way of making a
safe landing. Even during normal approaches, the navigator should monitor aircraft position both for
practice and as a backup to the regular approach.

7.22.1. During the ARA the navigator uses the radar to direct the aircraft to a point on the final approach
where the pilot can complete the landing visually.

7.22.2. There are two main phases in the ARA, the letdown and the approach itself. The letdown is
normally accomplished from a nearby VOR or TACAN station according to published procedures. If
these are not available, the navigator must pick a point on the extension of the runway that will provide
adequate time for descent and early alignment of the aircraft with the runway.

7.22.3. During the approach, the procedures vary with the capabilities of the radar. The navigator
provides headings, altitude calls, and distance-to-the-runway information for the pilots while fine tuning
the radar to break out the runway environment, approach lights, and runway itself. Terminal approach
plates should be used to locate possible hazards. On radars equipped with computers, use the crosshairs
to monitor the distance and direction to the end of the runway; otherwise, use the fixed range markers.
When using movable etched cursors for runway alignment reference, the landing environment moves
along the cursor if you are on course and heading. If the field return drifts from the cursor, turn the
aircraft. Remember to monitor drift angle (DA) changes due to wind shifts during descent.
192                                                               AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

Figure 7.18. Target Timing Wind Solution.




7.22.4. Use caution when flying an ARA without backup NAVAIDs for orientation and when using an
AZ STAB setting other than north orientation. Be familiar with runway location and direction relative to
surrounding returns. It is possible to fly an apparently good approach to the field only to find that the
aircraft is over the threshold but considerably off the runway heading. Again, a point on the runway
extension should he used for initial alignment with the runway to avoid this problem. Consult the
appropriate aircraft tech order for procedures for each type of radar.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      193

7.23. Station Keeping. Station keeping is a technique using radar to maintain a fixed position within a
formation. Formations may require separations of a mile or more. At these distances, radar is more
precise than the visual method for staying in position. In addition, it is superior to the visual method of
formation flying because it is an all-weather method.

7.23.1. Maintain formation position with fixed or variable range markers or with the crosshairs. With
radars having directional pencil-type beam, returns appear on any portion of the scope. On others,
aircraft in the formation may appear in the altitude hole. To use the basic radar set for station keeping,
consider altitude separation, angular offset, and airspeed adjustments. The relative importance of each of
these considerations depends on the type of formation being flown. Basic tuning for station keeping is
best achieved by placing the antenna in pencil beam, adjusting the tilt to level, and setting AZ STAB in
the relative position.

7.23.2. In trail formations, the most important aspect of formation position is airspeed. Navigators in
follower aircraft must monitor formation position and adjust airspeed to stay in position. During a radio
silent mission, follower navigators must think as lead to compute the proper airspeed. It's not sufficient
to match the lead aircraft's airspeed. Compensation must also be made for altitude differences. As a
general rule, 3 knots of IAS decrease for every 500 feet above lead's altitude will usually keep true
airspeeds close.

7.23.3. In an offset formation, the combination of airspeed and angular adjustments complicates the
problem. You should mark the angular offset and desired separation on the scope with either a
mechanical or an electronic cursor. Avoid extreme corrections when flying in formations.

7.23.4. This example presents one basic way to establish a position at a 60o offset at 1 NM (Figure 7.19).
First, maneuver the aircraft so that the lead's radar return is at the desired distance from the heading
marker (in this case 1 NM) and turn to lead's heading. Secondly, adjust airspeed so that lead's return
moves parallel to the heading marker toward the angular offset (this mechanical cursor is offset 60o from
the heading flash). Once in position, adjust airspeed to match leads. Equipment and capabilities vary
among aircraft, so expand upon these basics as necessary.

7.23.5. Aircraft equipped with station-keeping equipment (SKE) should follow the recommendations of
their associated manuals.

7.24. Weather Avoidance. Severe turbulence, hail, and icing associated with thunderstorms constitute
severe hazards to flight. You must avoid these thunderstorms whenever possible. Airborne weather
radar, if operated and interpreted properly, can be an invaluable aid in avoiding thunderstorm areas.

7.24.1. You must be aware of factors and limitations affecting thunderstorm radar returns to get the most
out of the radar. Some of these factors aren't meteorological and depend on the characteristics of the
radar and the way it is used. The same weather target can vary considerably in its appearance from
ground mapping mode to weather mode. Navigators must ensure they use the radar as intended for
weather avoidance. Primary meteorological factors that affect radar returns are the amount of moisture
in the weather target and atmospheric absorption characteristics between the radar antenna and the
target.
194                                                                AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

Figure 7.19. Station Keeping.




7.24.2. The predominant weather-induced returns on most radarscopes are caused by precipitation-size
water droplets, not by clouds. Intense returns indicate the presence of very large droplets. These large
droplets are generally associated with the most hazardous phenomena; those with strong vertical
currents which are necessary to maintain these droplets in the cloud. It is possible, however, to
encounter such strong turbulence in an echo-free area or even in an adjacent cloud-free area, so avoiding
areas giving intense returns will not necessarily guarantee safe flight in the vicinity of thunderstorms.
Refer to your command guidance for weather avoidance distances. Make careful note of all areas
forecast to have the potential for hazardous weather.

7.24.3. Generally, the map mode of the radar with a moderate amount of gain applied is adequate for
obtaining a return from hazardous cells. Sometimes, ground returns hamper detection in the area by
hiding the storm. This can occur in mountainous areas where ground returns are similar and airmass
lifting action breeds the cells. For these reasons, raising the radar tilt or switching to pencil beam (or
both) are techniques that will aid weather detection.

7.24.4. There are two types of weather avoidance with radar: (1) avoidance of isolated thunderstorms
and (2) penetration of a line of thunderstorms. Avoid an isolated return by first identifying it and then
circumnavigating it at a safe distance.

7.24.5. After detecting a weather system, determine its extent. Analyze the weather's layout relative to
planned track and decide either to deviate around it or penetrate the line. If the system is complex,
remember your deviation could worsen the situation by flying into a sucker hole, where a solid system
could surround the aircraft. Sometimes, what seems to be a good heading at short range will seem
foolish when viewed at long range. Remember that turning around is always an option and ARTCC can
sometimes assist in weather analysis.

7.24.6. A simple technique for flying around weather at a preferred distance (say 20 NM) is the flying
disc technique. Imagine the aircraft is a disc defined by the 20 NM range mark on the PPI. The heading
marker is the nose of the disc. Draw an imaginary tangent from the disc to the edge of the weather (or
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        195

use a pencil or plotter). Turn the aircraft the same number of degrees that it would take to get the
heading marker to fire parallel to the tangent. After the turn, recheck the heading in the same manner.
This technique works best with a scan of more than 180o (Figure 7.20).


Figure 7.20. Weather Avoidance.




7.24.7. Penetration of a line of thunderstorms is a last resort and presents a different problem. Since the
line may extend for hundreds of miles, circumnavigation is not practical or even possible. If no other
course of action exists, the main objective is to avoid the more dangerous areas in the line.

7.24.8. Figure 7.21 shows an example of frontal penetration using radar. An iso-echo equipped radar can
discriminate between the safe and violent areas. Without it, decreasing the gain will work to highlight
the worst areas by leaving the densest water cells as the last returns on the PPI. Upon approaching the
line, the navigator determines an area which has weak or no returns and which is large enough to allow
avoidance of all intense returns by the recommended distances throughout penetration. The navigator
directs the aircraft to that point, making the penetration at right angles to the line so as to remain in the
bad weather areas for the shortest possible time. Avoid the dangerous echoes by a safe distance.
Penetration of a line of severe thunderstorms is always a potentially dangerous procedure. Attempt it
only when you must continue the flight and cannot circumnavigate the line. Always advise ARTCC of
your intentions when deviating from your flight-planned route.

7.25. Heading Marker Correction. For optimum accuracy, it may sometimes become necessary to
correct the bearings taken on the various targets. This necessity arises when (1) the heading marker
reading does not agree with the TH of the aircraft when azimuth stabilization is used, or (2) the heading
marker reading does not agree with 360o when azimuth stabilization is not used.

EXAMPLE: If the TH is 125o and the heading marker reads 120o, all of the returns on the scope will
indicate a bearing that is 5o less than it should be. Therefore, if a target indicates a bearing of 50o, add 5o
to the bearing before plotting it. Conversely, if the heading marker reads 45o when the TH is 040o, all of
the scope returns will indicate a bearing that is 5o more than it should be. Therefore, if a target indicates
a bearing of 275o, subtract 5o from the bearing before plotting it. The greater the distance to the target
from the aircraft, the more important this heading marker correction becomes.

                                        CELESTIAL CONCEPTS

Section 8Aâ€”Introduction to Celestial Concepts

8.1. Basics. Celestial navigation is a universal aid to dead reckoning (DR). Because it is available
worldwide and is independent of electronic equipment, it is a very reliable method of fixing the position
of the aircraft. It cannot be jammed and emanates no signals. Each celestial observation yields one line
of position (LOP). In the daytime, when the sun may be the only visible celestial body, a single LOP
may be all you can get. At night, when numerous bodies are available, LOPs obtained observing two or
more bodies may be crossed to determine a fix.

8.1.1. It is impossible to predict, in so many miles, the accuracy of a celestial fix. Celestial accuracy
depends on the navigator's skill, the type and condition of the equipment, and the weather. With the
increase in aircraft speed and range, celestial navigation is very demanding. Fixes must be plotted and
used as quickly as possible.

8.1.2. You don't have to be an astronomer or mathematician to establish a celestial LOP. Your ability to
use a sextant is a matter of practice, and specially designed celestial tables have reduced the
computations to simple arithmetic.

8.1.3. Although you don't need to understand astronomy in detail to establish an accurate celestial
position, celestial work and celestial LOPs mean more if you understand the basics of celestial
astronomy. Celestial astronomy includes the navigational bodies in the universe and their relative
motions. Although there are an infinite number of heavenly bodies, celestial navigation utilizes only 63
of them: 57 stars, the moon, the sun, Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn.

8.2. Assumptions. We make certain assumptions to simplify celestial navigation. These assumptions
help you obtain accurate LOPs without a detailed knowledge of celestial astronomy. However, celestial
positioning is more than extracting numbers from various books. A working knowledge of celestial
concepts will help you crosscheck your computations.

8.2.1. First, assume the earth is a perfect sphere. That puts every point on the earth's surface equidistant
from the center, forming the terrestrial sphere. Next, assume the terrestrial sphere is the center of an
infinite universe. Finally, assume all other bodies, except the moon, are an infinite distance from the
terrestrial sphere. Imagine them on the inside surface of an enormous concentric sphere, the celestial
sphere. If the stars, planets, and sun are infinitely distant from the earth's center, then the earth's surface
(or aircraft's altitude) is approximately the center of the universe.

8.2.2. Ptolemy proposed the celestial concept of the universe in AD 127. He said the earth is the center
of the universe, and all bodies rotate about the earth from east to west. In the relatively short periods of
time involved with celestial positioning, you can assume that all bodies on the celestial sphere rotate at
the same rate. In actuality, over months or years, the planets move among the stars at varying rates.

8.2.3. Establishing an artificial celestial sphere with an infinite radius simplifies computations for three
reasons. First, since the terrestrial and celestial spheres are geometrically similar, every point on the
198                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

celestial sphere has a corresponding point on the terrestrial sphere and; conversely, every point on the
terrestrial sphere has a corresponding point on the celestial sphere.

8.2.4. Second, the celestial sphere's infinite radius dwarfs variations in the observer's location. An
infinite radius means all light rays from the celestial body arrive parallel, so the angle is the same
whether viewed at the earth's center, on the surface, or at the aircraft's altitude.

8.2.5. Third, the relationships are valid for all bodies on the celestial sphere. Because the moon is
relatively close to the earth, it must be treated differently. With certain corrections, the moon still
provides an accurate LOP. This will be addressed in Chapter 10.

8.2.6. Because the celestial sphere and terrestrial sphere are concentric, each sphere contains an equator,
two poles, meridians, and parallels of latitude or declination. The observer on earth has a corresponding
point directly overhead on the celestial sphere called the zenith. A celestial body has a corresponding
point on the terrestrial sphere directly below it called the subpoint or geographic position. At the
subpoint, the light rays from the body are perpendicular to the earth's surface. See Figures 8.1 and 8.2.

8.2.7. Consistent with the celestial assumptions, the earth and the celestial meridians don't rotate. All
bodies on the celestial sphere rotate 15o per hour past the celestial meridians. The moon moves at
approximately 14.5o per hour.

Section 8Bâ€”Motion of Celestial Bodies

8.3. Basics. All the celestial bodies have two types of motion, absolute and apparent. Apparent motion is
important to navigators. Apparent motion is the motion of one celestial body as perceived by an
observer on another moving celestial body. Since apparent motion is relative, it is essential to establish
the reference point for that motion. For example, the apparent motion of Venus would be different if
observed from the earth or the sun.

8.4. Apparent Motion. The earth's rotation and revolution causes the apparent motion of the celestial
bodies. Rotation causes celestial bodies to appear to rise in the east, climb to a maximum height, then set
in the west. All bodies appear to move along a diurnal circle, approximately parallel to the plane of the
equator.

8.4.1. The apparent effect of rotation varies with the observer's latitude. At the equator, the bodies
appear to rise and set perpendicular to the horizon. Each body is above the horizon for approximately 12
hours each day. At the North and South Poles, a different phenomenon occurs. The same group of stars
is continually above the horizon; they neither rise nor set, but move on a plane parallel to the equator.
This characteristic explains the periods of extended daylight, twilight, and darkness at higher latitudes.
The remainder of the earth is a combination of these two extremes; that is, some bodies will rise and set,
while others will continually remain above the horizon.

8.4.2. The greater the northerly declination of a body, the higher it appears in the sky to an observer at
the North Pole. Polaris, with a declination of almost 90o, appears overhead. Bodies with southern
declination are not visible from the North Pole.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                    199

Figure 8.1. Celestial Points and Subpoints on Earth Have the Same Relationship.




Figure 8.2. Elements of the Celestial Sphere.




8.4.3. A circumpolar body appears to revolve about the pole and never set. If the angular distance of the
body from the elevated pole is less than the observer's latitude, the body is circumpolar. For example,
the declination of Dubhe is 62o N. Therefore, it is located at an angle of 90o â€“ 62o from the North Pole,
or 28o. So, an observer located above 28o N will view Dubhe as circumpolar. Although Figure 8.3 uses
the North Pole, the same characteristics can be observed from the South Pole.

Figure 8.3. Some Bodies Are Circumpolar.




8.4.4. If the earth stopped rotating, the effect of the earth's revolution on the apparent motion of celestial
bodies would be obvious. The sun would appear to circle around the earth once each year. It would
cover 360o in 365 days, or move eastward at slightly less than 1 degree per day. The stars would move at
the same rate. (That's why different constellations are visible at different times of the year. Every
evening the same star appears to rise 4 minutes earlier.)

8.4.5. After half a year, when the earth reached the opposite extreme of its orbit, its dark side would be
turned in the opposite direction in space, facing a new field of stars. Hence, an observer at the equator
would see an entirely different sky at midnight in June than the one that appeared at midnight in
December. In fact, the stars seen at midnight in June are those that were above the horizon at midday in
December.

8.5. Seasons. The annual variation of the sun's declination and the consequent change of the seasons are
caused by the revolution of the earth (Figure 8.4). If the celestial equator coincided with the ecliptic, the
sun would always be overhead at the equator, and its declination would always be zero. However, the
earth's axis is inclined about 66 1/2o to the plane of the earth's orbit, and the plane of the equator is
inclined about 23 1/2o. Throughout the year, the axis points in the same direction. That is, the axis of the
earth in one part of the orbit is parallel to the axis of the earth in any other part of the orbit (Figure 8.5).

8.5.1. In June, the North Pole is inclined toward the sun so that the sun is at a maximum distance from
the plane of the equator. About June 22, at the solstice, the sun has its greatest northern declination.

8.5.2. The solstice brings the long days of summer, while in the Southern Hemisphere, the days are
shortest. This is the beginning of summer for the Northern Hemisphere and of winter for the Southern
Hemisphere. Six months later, the axis is still pointing in the same direction; but, since the earth is at the
opposite side of its orbit and the sun, the North Pole is inclined away from the Sun. At the winter
AFPAM11-216         1 MARCH 2001                                                                    201

solstice, about December 21, the sun has its greatest southern declination. Days are shortest in the
Northern Hemisphere, and winter is beginning.

8.5.3. Halfway between the two solstices, the axis of the earth is inclined neither toward nor away from
the sun, and the sun is on the plane of the equator. These positions correspond to the beginning spring
and fall.

Section 8Câ€”Celestial Coordinates

8.6. Basics. Celestial bodies and the observer's zenith may be positioned on the celestial sphere, using a
coordinate system similar to that of the earth. Terrestrial lines of latitude correspond to celestial parallels
of declination. Lines of longitude establish the celestial meridians.

8.6.1. The observer's celestial meridian is a great circle containing the zenith, the nadir, and the celestial
poles (Figure 8.2). A line extended from the observer's zenith, through the center of the earth, intersects
the celestial sphere at the observer's nadir, the point on the celestial sphere directly beneath the
observer's position. The poles divide the celestial meridians into upper and lower branches. The upper
branch contains the observer's zenith. The lower branch contains the nadir.

8.6.2. A second great circle on the celestial sphere is the hour circle. The hour circle contains the
celestial body and the celestial poles. Unlike celestial meridians, which remain stationary, hour circles
rotate 15o per hour. Hour circles also contain upper and lower branches. The upper branch contains the
body. Again, the moon's hour circle moves at a different rate. The subpoint is the point on the earth's
surface directly beneath the celestial body.

8.6.3. You can locate any body on the celestial sphere relative to the celestial equator and the Greenwich
meridian using declination and Greenwich hour angle.

8.7. Declination (Dec). Declination is the angular distance a celestial body is north or south of the
celestial equator measured along the hour circle. It ranges from 0o to 90o and corresponds to latitude.

8.8. Greenwich Hour Angle (GHA). GHA is the angular distance measured westward from the
Greenwich celestial meridian to the upper branch of the hour circle. It has a range of 0o to 360o. The Air
Almanac lists the GHA and the Dec of the sun, moon, four planets, and Aries. The subpoint's latitude
matches its Dec, and its longitude correlates to its GHA, but not exactly. GHA is always measured
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       203

westward from the Greenwich celestial meridian, and longitude is measured in the shortest direction
from the Greenwich meridian to the observer's meridian.

8.8.1. The following are examples of converting a body's celestial coordinates to its subpoint's terrestrial
coordinates. If the GHA is less than 180o, then the subpoint is in the Western Hemisphere and GHA
equals longitude. When the GHA is greater than 180o, the subpoint is in the Eastern Hemisphere and
longitude equals 360o â€“ GHA. Again, Dec and latitude are equal (Figure 8.6).


    Dec S13o-15'â€”Lat 13o-15' S
    GHA 135o-00'â€”Longitude 135o-00' W
    Dec N11o-32'â€”Lat 11o-32' N
    GHA 290o-00'â€”Longitude 070o-00' E


Figure 8.6. Declination of a Body Corresponds to a Parallel of Latitude.




8.8.2. You will use two other hour angles in celestial navigation in addition to GHA (Figure 8.7), local
hour angle (LHA), and sidereal hour angle (SHA). LHA is the angular distance from the observer's
celestial meridian clockwise to the hour circle. LHA is computed by applying the local longitude to the
GHA of the body. In the Western Hemisphere, LHA equals GHA - W Long, and in the Eastern
Hemisphere, LHA equals GHA + E Long (Figure 8.8). When the LHA is 0, the body's hour circle and
the upper branch of the observer's celestial meridian are collocated, and the body is in transit. If the LHA
is 180, the hour circle is coincident with the lower branch of the observer's celestial meridian. SHA is
used with the first point of Aries. The first point of Aries is the point where the sun appears to cross the
celestial equator from south to north on the vernal equinox or first day of spring. Though not absolutely
stationary relative to the stars, Aries moves so slowly that we consider it fixed on the celestial equator
for as long as a year. The SHA is the angular measurement from the hour circle of Aries to the star's
hour circle (Figure 8.9). Aries and the stars move together so the SHA remains constant for a year.

Section 8Dâ€”Use of the Air Almanac

8.9. Basics. Although the Air Almanac contains astronomical amounts of data, most of it is devoted to
tabulating the GHA of Aries and the GHA and Declination (Dec) of the sun, moon, and the three
navigational planets most favorably located for observation. Enter the daily pages with Greenwich date
and GMT to extract the GHA and Dec of a celestial body.

8.10. Finding GHA and Dec. The GHA is listed for 10-minute intervals on each daily sheet. If the
observation time is listed, read the GHA and Dec directly under the proper column opposite the time.

8.10.1. For example, find the sun's GHA and Dec at GMT 0540 on 11 August 1995 (Figure 8.10). The
GHA is 263o-41' and Dec is N 15o-24'. (Extractions of GHA and Dec are to the nearest whole minute.)
To convert these values to the subpoint's geographical coordinates, latitude is North 15o-24'. When GHA
is greater than 180o, subtract it from 360o to get east longitude. The subpoint's longitude in this example
is (360o-00' minus 263o-41') East 96o-19'.

8.10.2. When you don't observe at a 10-minute interval, use the time immediately before the observation
time. Then use the Interpolation of GHA table on the inside front cover of the Air Almanac or the back
of the star chart and add the increment to the GHA (Figure 8.11).

8.10.3. For example, on 11 August 1995, you observe the sun at 1012 GMT. Enter Figure 8.10 to find
the GHA listed for 1010 (331o-11'). Since the observation was 2 minutes after the listed time, enter the
Interpolation of GHA table (Figure 8.11) and find the correction listed for 2 minutes of time (30'). Add
this correction to the listed GHA to determine the sun's exact GHA at 1012 (331o-41'). The Dec for the
same time is N 15o-21'. Thus, at the time of the observation, the subpoint of the sun is at latitude 15o-21'
N, longitude (360o-00' minus 331o-41') 028o-19' E.
206                                                        AFPAM11-216   1 MARCH 2001

Figure 8.10. Daily Page From Air Almanacâ€”11 August 1995.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       207

8.10.4. You can find the GHA and Dec of a planet in almost the same way as the sun. Because the
planet's Dec change slowly, they are recorded only at hourly intervals. Use the Dec listed for the entire
hour. For example, to find the GHA and Dec of Jupiter at 1109 GMT, 11 August 1995, enter the correct
daily page (Figure 8.10) for the time of 1100 GMT. The GHA is 240o-35' and the Dec is S20o-40'. Enter
the Interpolation of GHA table under sun, etc., (Figure 8.11) to get the adjustment for 9 minutes of time,
2o-15'. Therefore, GHA is 242o-50'. Jupiter's subpoint is at latitude 20o-40' S, longitude (360o-00' minus
242o-50') 117o-10' E.

8.10.5. If you need to find an accurate GHA and Dec without the Air Almanac, you can find the
procedures and applicable tables in Pub. No. 249, Volume 1 for Aries or Volume 2 or 3 for the sun.

8.11. Finding GHA and Dec of Moon. The moon moves across the sky at a different rate than other
celestial bodies. In the Interpolation of GHA table, the intervals for the moon are listed in the right
column where the values for the sun, Aries, and the planets are in the left column.

8.11.1. The interpolation of GHA table is a critical table and the increment is opposite the interval in
which the difference of GMT occurs. If the difference (for example, 06'-31" for the moon) is an exact
tabular value, take the upper (or right) of the two possible increments (that is, 1o-34'). The up or right
rule applies to all critical tables.

8.11.2. For example, at 1136 GMT on 11 August 1995 you observe the moon. The following
information is from the Air Almanac (Figures 8.10 and 8.11):

      GHA of moon at 1130 GMT 163o 16'
      GHA correction for 6 minutes 1o 27'

      GHA 164o 43'
      Dec S8o 00'

Thus at 1136Z, the moon's subpoint is located at S 8o-00', longitude 164o-43'W.

8.12. Finding GHA and Dec of a Star. The stars and the first point of Aries remain fixed in their
relative positions in space, so the gas of the stars and Aries change at the same rate. Rather than list the
GHA and Dec of every star throughout the day, the Air Almanac lists the GHA of Aries at 10-minute
intervals and gives the sidereal hour angle (SHA) of the stars. The GHA of a star for any time can be
found by adding the GHA of Aries and the SHA of the star. The GHA of a star is used to precomp any
star that falls within 29o (declination) of the equator using Volume 2 or Volume 3.

8.12.1. The table, STARS, is inside the front cover of the almanac and on the back of the star chart. This
table lists navigational stars and the following information for each star: the number corresponding to
the sky diagram in the back, the name, the magnitude or relative brightness, the SHA, the Dec, whether
used in Pub. No. 249, and stars that can be used with Dec tables. NOTE: If you need a higher degree of
accuracy, the SHA and Dec of the stars are listed to tenths of a degree in the Air Almanac's appendix.

8.12.2. For example, at 0124 GMT on 11 August 1995, you observe Altair. To find the GHA and Dec
look at the extracts from the tables in Figures 8.11 and 8.12.
208                                                          AFPAM11-216   1 MARCH 2001

      GHA at 0120 GMT:                    339o-03'
      GHA correction for 4 minutes:         1o-00'
      GHA for 0124:                       340o-03'
      SHA Altair                           62o-21'
      GHA for Altair at 0124:              42o-24'
      Dec Altair                           N8o-52'

      Thus the subpoint of Altair is 08o-52' N 042o-24' W.

8.13. Summary. All the celestial concepts and assumptions you've learned may help you obtain a
celestial LOP. A celestial LOP is simply a circle plotted with the center at the subpoint and a radius
equal to the distance from the observer to the subpoint. To accurately compute this distance and the
direction to the subpoint of the body, you must initially position the subpoint and then measure the
angular displacement of the body above the horizon. GHA and Dec position the body, and the sextant
measures the height above the horizon. A basic knowledge of celestial theory and LOPs will help you
appreciate celestial navigation and detect errors. The next section explains how angular displacement is
measured.

Section 8Eâ€”Celestial Horizon

8.14. Basics. You use a sextant to measure a body's angular displacement above the horizon. The
celestial horizon is a plane passing through the earth's center perpendicular to the zenith-nadir axis. The
visual horizon approximates this plane at the earth's surface. Figure 8.13 depicts the zenith-nadir axis
and the celestial horizon. The angular displacement you see through a sextant is the height observed, or
Ho. Ho is measured along the vertical circle above the horizon. The vertical circle is a great circle
containing the zenith, nadir, and celestial body. The body's altitude is the same whether measured at the
earth's surface from an artificial horizon or at the center of the earth from the celestial horizon because
these horizons are parallel and the light rays from the body are essentially parallel. Figure 8.14 shows
210                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

that the infinite celestial sphere makes the difference in angle for light rays arriving at different points on
the earth infinitesimal.


Figure 8.13. Celestial Horizon is 90o From Observer Zenith and Nadir.




Figure 8.14. Parallel Lines Make Equal Angles With Parallel Planes.




8.14.1. The angle between light rays is called parallax. In Figure 8.15, parallax is shown at its
maximum; that is, when the observer and the subpoint are separated by 90o. Since the earth's radius is
tiny compared to the infinite distance to the stars, the angle p is very small. For the sun, angle p is a
negligible 9 seconds of arc or 0.15 NM. Observed altitudes from either the artificial or celestial horizon
are practically the same.

8.14.2. The bubble in a sextant or artificial horizon is most used by navigators. As in a carpenter's level,
a bubble indicates the apparent vertical and horizontal. With the bubble, the navigator can level the
sextant and establish an artificial horizon parallel to the plane of the celestial horizon. Figure 8.16 shows
that the plane of the artificial (bubble) horizon and the plane of the celestial horizon are parallel and
AFPAM11-216         1 MARCH 2001                                                                    211

separated by the earth's radius. Compared to the vast distances of space, the radius of the earth is
inconsequential. Thus, the artificial horizon and the celestial horizon are nearly identical.


Figure 8.15. Parallax.




Figure 8.16. The Two Planes Are Parallel.




8.15. Observed Altitude. The distance of the observer from the subpoint and a body's Ho are related.
(Figure 8.17). When the body is directly overhead, the Ho is 90o, and the subpoint and the observer's
position are collocated. When the Ho is 0o, the body is on the horizon and the subpoint is 90o (5,400
NM) from the observer's position (See Figure 8.18, where C is the center of the earth, AB is the
observer's horizon, and S is the subpoint of the body). Since the sum of the angles in a triangle equals
180o, the angle OX is equal to 180o â€“ (Ho + P). The sum of the angles on a straight line equals 180o, so
angle OXC is equal to Ho + P. The horizon AB being tangent to the earth at O is perpendicular to OC, a
radius of the earth. Thus, angle OCX equals 90o (Ho + P). The preceding discussion showed that angle P
is negligible, so this angle becomes 90o â€“ Ho. The arc on the surface subtended by the angle OCX at the
center of the earth is arc OS. This arc then is equal to 90o â€“ Ho.
212                                                               AFPAM11-216         1 MARCH 2001

Figure 8.17. Measure Altitude From Celestial Horizon Along Vertical Circle.




Figure 8.18. Finding Observed Altitude.




8.15.1. The distance from the subpoint to the observer is the zenith distance or co-alt and is computed
using the astronomical triangle described in Chapter 9. Basically, the zenith distance equals 90o minus
the Ho (Figure 8.19). The figures are then converted to NM by multiplying the number of degrees by 60
and adding in the odd minutes of arc.

      Ho                   = 37o26'
      therefore, co-alt    = 90o â€“ 37o26'
      therefore, co-alt    = 52o34'
      Zenith Distance      = (52o x 60) + 34'
      Zenith Distance      = 3,154 NM
      Zenith distance is the radius of the circle which becomes the celestial LOP.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                        213

8.15.2. This circle is called the circle of equal altitude (Figure 8.20), as anyone located on it will view an
identical Ho. Now that you can determine the distance to the subpoint, you must next find the direction.

8.16. True Azimuth (Zn). The direction to a body from an observer is called Zn. A celestial body's Zn
is the true bearing (TB) to its subpoint. The Zn is the angle measured at the observer's position from true
north (TN) clockwise through 360o to the great circle arc joining the observer's position with subpoint,
as illustrated in Figure 8.21. If you could measure the Zn when you measure its altitude, you could have
a fix. Unfortunately, there is no instrument in the aircraft which will measure Zn accurately enough.
Except in the case of a very high body (85-90 degrees), if you observe a body with a Ho of 40o and you
mismeasure the Zn by 1 degree, the fix will be 50 NM off.

Figure 8.21. Relationship of True Azimuth to an Observer.




8.17. Celestial Fix. Since you cannot normally fix off a single body, you will usually need to cross two
or more LOPs. The fix position is the intersection of the LOPs. A celestial LOP is a circle as shown in
Figure 8.22. When two celestial LOPs are plotted, they intersect at two points, only one of which can be
your position. In practice, these two intersections usually are so far apart that dead reckoning removes
all doubt as to which is correct.

                        COMPUTING ALTITUDE AND TRUE AZIMUTH

Section 9Aâ€”Introduction

9.1. Basics. This chapter discusses the procedures and some of the tables used to compute a celestial line
of position (LOP). Some of the tables used to resolve the LOP, including the Air Almanac, were
previously mentioned. First, we'll discuss the astronomical triangle upon which the tables are based.
Then we'll cover how to determine the local hour angle (LHA) of Aries and the LHA of a star.

Section 9Bâ€”LHA and the Astronomical Triangle

9.2. Basics. The basic principle of celestial navigation is to consider yourself to be at a certain assumed
position at a given time; then, by means of the sextant, determining how much your basic assumption is
in error. At any given time, an observer has a certain relationship to a particular star. The observer is a
certain number of nautical miles away from the subpoint, and the body is at a certain true bearing called
true azimuth (Zn), measured from the observer's position (Figure 9.1).


Figure 9.1. Subpoint of a Star.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      217

9.3. Intercept. Assume yourself to be at a given point (called the assumed position). At a given time,
there exists at that instant a specific relationship between your assumed position and the subpoint. The
various navigational tables provide you with this relationship by solving the astronomical triangle for
you. From the navigational tables, you can determine how far away your assumed position is from the
subpoint and the Zn of the subpoint from the assumed position. This means, in effect, that the tables give
you a value called computed altitude (Hc) which would be the correct observed altitude (Ho) if you were
anywhere on the circle of equal altitude through the assumed position. Any difference between the Hc
determined for the assumed position and the Ho as determined by the sextant for the actual position is
called intercept. Intercept is the number of NM between your actual circle of equal altitude and the circle
of equal altitude through the assumed position. It is by means of the astronomical triangle that you can
solve for Hc and Zn in the Pub. No. 249 tables.

9.4. Construction of the Astronomical Triangle. Consider the solution of a star as it appears on the
celestial sphere. Start with the Greenwich meridian and the equator. Projected on the celestial sphere,
these become the celestial meridian and the celestial equator (called equinoctial) as shown in Figure 9.2.
Notice also in the same illustration how other known information is derived, namely the LHA of the star
Ariesâ€”equal to the Greenwich hour angle (GHA) of Aries minus longitude west. You can also see that
if the LHA of Aries and sidereal hour angle (SHA) of the star are known, the LHA of the star is their
sum. It should also be evident that the GHA of Aries plus SHA of the star equals GHA of the star. Also,
the GHA of the body minus west longitude (or plus east longitude) of the observer's zenith equals LHA
of the body. These are important relationships used in the derivation of the Hc and Zn.

9.4.1. Figure 9.3 shows part of the celestial sphere and the astronomical triangle. Notice that the known
information of the astronomical triangle is the two sides and the included angle; that is, Co-Dec, Co-Lat
and LHA of the star. Co-Dec, or polar distance, is the angular distance measured along the hour circle of
the body from the elevated pole to the body. The side, Co-Lat, is 90o minus the latitude of the assumed
position. The included angle in this example is the LHA. With two sides and the included angle of the
spherical triangle known, the third side and the interior angle at the observer are easily solved. The third
side is the zenith distance, and the interior angle at the observer is the azimuth angle (Z). Instead of
listing the zenith distance, the astronomical tables list the remaining portion of the 90o from the zenith,
or the Hc. Hc equals 90o minus zenith distance of the assumed position, just as zenith distance of the
assumed position equals 90o â€“ Hc. Note that when measured with reference to the celestial horizon,
zenith distance is synonymous with co-altitude. Figure 9.4 is a side view of this solution.


Figure 9.3. Celestialâ€”Terrestial Relationship.




9.4.2. So far, the astronomical triangle has been defined only on the celestial sphere. Refer again to
Figure 9.3 and notice the same triangle on the terrestrial sphere (earth). The same triangle with its
corresponding vertices may be defined on the earth as follows: (1) celestial poleâ€”terrestrial pole; (2)
zenith of assumed positionâ€”assumed position; and (3) starâ€”-subpoint of the star. The three interior
angles of this triangle are exactly equal to the angles on the celestial sphere. The angular distance of
each of the three sides is exactly equal to the corresponding side on the astronomical triangle. Celestial
and terrestrial terms are used interchangeably. For example, refer to Figure 9.3 and notice that Co-Lat on
the terrestrial triangle is also called Co-Lat on the celestial triangle. To be perfectly correct, the term on
the celestial sphere corresponding to latitude on the earth is declination (Dec); therefore, the celestial
side could well be called co-declination of the zenith of the assumed position.

Figure 9.4. Co-Altitude Equals 90 Minus Hc.




9.4.3. Rather than have this confusion, the terrestrial term Co-Lat is also used with reference to the
celestial sphere, just as latitude of the subpoint is considered to be the Dec amount from the equator.
Latitude is used when referring to the observer or zenith, and Dec is used when referring to the star or its
subpoint. The distance between the subpoint and the assumed position is generally referred to as zenith
distance (Co-Alt) rather than the segment of the vertical circle joining the subpoint and the assumed
position. These angular distance terms are interchangeable on the celestial and terrestrial spheres.

9.4.4. The values of the Zn and the interior angle (Z) are listed in the Pub. No. 249 tables depending
upon whether or not a Dec solution is desired. Pub. No. 249, Volume 1, lists the Zn rather than the
interior angle. Pub. No. 249, Volumes 2 and 3, list the interior angle (Z). It is necessary to follow rules
printed on each page to convert the interior angle (Z) to true azimuth (Zn).

9.5. Pub. No. 249, Volume 1. This volume deals solely with the solution concerning selected stars and
is considered separately from Volumes 2 and 3. Volume 1 provides complete worldwide coverage from
pole to pole for each degree of latitude. The LHA of Aries is listed in 1o increments from latitudes of 0o
to 69o North and South inclusive. From 70o through 89o of latitude, the meridians are so close together
that it is only necessary to tabulate the values of the LHA of Aries in even 2o increments. There are two
pages devoted to each whole degree of latitude between latitudes 69o N and 69o S inclusive. From there
to the pole, only one page is devoted to each whole degree of latitude. The three stars marked by
diamonds on each page provide sets for fixing purposes, which are favorably situated in altitude and
azimuth.

9.5.1. The entering arguments are the assumed latitude and the LHA of Aries (to whole degrees). At any
one time, the navigator has the choice of the seven listed stars for that latitude plus Polaris. The names
of the stars are in capital letters if the star is of first magnitude or brighter; the second magnitude stars
are printed in small letters. The names of the stars are listed every 15o of LHA of Aries (every 30o in the
polar latitudes). For the time the navigator expects to make an observation, commonly called a shot, they
look up the GHA of Aries and apply the approximate longitude to get a whole degree LHA of Aries. The
220                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

navigator then enters Pub. No. 249, Volume 1, with the latitude closest to the dead reckoning (DR)
latitude and the LHA of Aries to select the stars that will be shot.

9.5.2. Since single celestial observation results in only one LOP, it is necessary to shoot two or more
bodies to obtain a fix. Suppose the navigator wants to shoot at approximately 0230 Greenwich Mean
Time (GMT), he or she looks up the GHA of Aries (in the Air Almanac) and finds it to be 196o. The DR
position for this time is 31o48' N, 075o26' W. A quick calculation shows the LHA of Aries is
approximately 121o, and the closest latitude is 32o N. Notice in the portion of the tables reproduced in
Figure 9.5 the available stars at this position are Alkaid, Regulus, Alphard, Sirius, Rigel, Aldebaran, and
Capella. Using Sirius, a shot is taken at 0231 and the Ho obtained is 37o50'.

9.5.3. The closest whole degree of latitude is 32o N; therefore, it is used as the assumed latitude. The
assumed longitude is selected as the closest point, resulting in an LHA of Aries that is a whole degree
(no minutes). The Hc of Sirius is listed as 37o40'. The Zn is 205o.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       221

9.5.4. The second shot was taken at 0234 using Regulus, the Ho being 55o30'. A new DR position could
be obtained for 0234 GMT, but the 0230Z DR position will suffice for this determination of Hc and Zn.

      GHA Aries for 0230 GMT                    196o06'
      Correction for 4 minutes                    1o00'

      Closest longitude for whole LHA         W075o06'        (assumed longitude)
      LHA Aries for 0234Z                      122o

9.5.5. The assumed latitude is still 32o N and, in this case, 075o06' W is the assumed longitude since this
is the closest longitude to the DR longitude that results in the LHA of Aries being a whole degree. The
Hc of Regulus is listed as 56o19', and the Zn is 119o. The various corrections that must be applied as
well as the plotting of the fix are discussed later.

9.6. Postcomputation Method. The steps in this procedure are as follows:

9.6.1. Determine the GHA of Aries for the time of observation from the Air Almanac.

9.6.2. Assume a position as close as possible to the DR position at the time of the shot so the latitude and
LHA of Aries in whole degrees may be determined.

9.6.3. Turn to the page in Pub. No. 249 for the assumed latitude and, opposite the LHA of Aries, select
the stars to be shot. In making the selection, assume the LHA of Aries will change 1o every 4 minutes of
time.

9.6.4. Shoot the body and record the time, Ho, and name of the body.

9.6.5. Obtain the GHA of Aries for the time of the observation, and apply the assumed longitude to
determine the LHA of Aries.

9.6.6. Turn to the pages for the assumed latitude and, opposite the LHA of Aries in the column headed
by the name of the star, find and record the Hc and Zn.

9.7. Pub. No. 249, Volumes 2 and 3. Volume 1 consists of tables of Hc and Zn for selected stars.
Because the Dec and SHA of each star change slowly, these tables may be used for many years with
only small corrections. The Dec and SHA of a nonstellar body change rapidly, making a permanent
format similar to Volume 1 impossible for the sun, moon, and planets.

9.7.1. Volumes 2 and 3 have Dec tables adequate for determining the Hc and Zn of any celestial body
within the Dec range of 30o N to 30o S. They are intended primarily for use when observing nonstellar
(solar system) bodies. Volume 2 provides latitudes between 39o N and 39o S, and Volume 3 provides for
latitudes from 40o N or S to the poles.

9.7.2. Provision is made for observed altitudes from 90o above to 3o below the horizon (7o from latitudes
70o to the pole). In view of refraction and of possible long intercepts, the tables are actually extended 2o
below these limits.
222                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

9.8. Entering Arguments. Volumes 2 and 3 are entered with the LHA of the body, in contrast to
Volume 1, which is entered with the LHA of Aries. The range extends from 0o through all LHAs
applicable within the altitude limits of the body. Between latitude 70o and the pole, the LHA interval is
2o; for latitudes below 70o, the interval is 1o. Arguments of LHA of the body less than 180o appear on
the left margin, and arguments greater than 180o appear on the right.

9.8.1. Several pages are devoted to each degree of latitude. Each page has 15 declination columns and is
labeled with its value at the top and bottom. Each page is also marked Declination Contrary Name to
Latitude or Declination Same Name as Latitude.

9.8.2. The entering arguments of LHA of the body, for declination of contrary name to latitude, always
increase from the bottom of the page on the left side, and decrease on the right. The opposite
arrangement exists on pages where Dec and latitude has the same name. Occasionally, one page will be
blank in the middle and the top half will cover Declination Same Name as Latitude, while the bottom
half will be Declination Contrary Name to Latitude.

9.8.3. Azimuth angle (Z) is listed instead of true azimuth (Zn). Since Zn is used for plotting, it is
necessary to convert Z to Zn. The rules for conversion are listed on the left-hand side at the top and
bottom of every page. Notice that LHA and Zn will never occur on the same side of 180o.

9.8.4. In addition to Hc and Z, a value of d is also listed. This d-value is the change in altitude (Hc) with
a 1o increase in Dec. If the LHA and Dec of the body and the latitude of the assumed position are each a
whole number of degrees, the Hc and Z are found in the correct Dec column opposite the LHA of the
body on the page marked by the proper latitude value.

9.8.5. For example, refer to the portion of the table shown in Figure 9.6. At the latitude 40o N, if the
LHA of a body is 86o and its Dec is 5o N, the Hc is 06o16' and the azimuth angle (Z) is 089o. The rule in
the upper left-hand corner of the page applies for the conversion of Z to Zn. Zn = (360o â€“ Z) or (360o â€“
089o) = 271o. Here again the position is assumed so that latitude and LHA are whole numbers.

9.9. Interpolation for Declination (Dec). When the Dec of a body is a number of minutes in addition to
a whole number of degrees, the altitude (Hc) is extracted for the whole number of degrees and corrected
by interpolation for the additional minutes. There is rarely a need for interpolation of Z, which is given
only to the nearest degree.

9.9.1. Interpolation for Hc should always be made in the direction of increasing Dec in accordance with
the sign of the d-value. Not all of the signs are printed; the sign is given at least once in each block of
five entries, and can always be found by looking either up or down the column from the value of d in
question. The correction to altitude for additional minutes of Dec is proportional to d and proportional to
the number of additional minutes.

9.9.2. In the previous example, the latitude was 40o , the LHA of the body was 086o, and the Dec was 5o
N. Suppose the Dec had been 5o17' N. The basic figures obtained would be 06o16' Hc and 089o Z as
before, and the true azimuth (Zn) would still be 271o. The Hc of 06o16' is not correct for a Dec of 5o17'
N, but is correct for 5o N. The Hc change for an additional 1o of Dec (d-value) is +39 minutes of altitude.
However, the correction needed in this case is for 17 minutes of Dec, not a whole degree. Consequently,
the additional correction is 17/60 of 39'. To the closest whole number, this would be +11 minutes of
altitude.

Figure 9.6. Enter Tables With Latitude, Declination, and LHA.




9.9.3. This multiplication can be done on the slide rule face of the DR computer or by means of a table
found in back of Pub. No. 249, Volumes 2 and 3. A portion of this table is shown in Figure 9.7. Notice
that there are no signs listed. The proper sign for the answer from this table is the same sign as the basic
d-value. A rule of thumb is the correction will be a plus (+) for declination of same name as latitude and
a negative (-) for declination of contrary name as latitude. Values of d are given across the top of the
table, and additional minutes of Dec are given down the side of the table. In the table, the correction 11'
is found by looking across 17' for Dec and down 39' for d to their intersection at 11'. Since the sign of
the d-value is plus, this correction is added to the tabulated Hc. The correct Hc value then becomes
06o16' + 11' or 06o27'.

9.9.4. Following is a sample problem illustrating the solution. Refer to the portion of the tables in Figure
9.8 for the solution. Suppose the sun is observed at 1005 GMT. The DR position is 38o12' N, 101o47' E,
and the Ho of the sun is 10o52'.

9.9.5. The closest whole degree of latitude is 38o N and is used as the assumed latitude. Since the
assumed latitude is north and Dec is south, the navigator must use Pub. 249, Volume 2, page for 38o
latitude which is headed Declination (0oâ€“14o) Contrary Name to Latitude. Following LHA 070o across
the page to 7o Dec, the navigator extracts:

9.10. Postcomp Summary. Before proceeding, review the procedures for finding the Hc and Zn of a
body whose Dec lies between 30o N and 30o S, using Pub. No. 249, Volume 2 or 3.

9.10.1. Shoot the body and record the time of observation, the body's name, and the Ho.

9.10.2. From the Air Almanac, extract GHA and Dec of the body for the time of the observation.

9.10.3. Assume a position close to the DR position so that the latitude is a whole number of degrees and
the longitude combined with the GHA of the body gives a whole number of degrees of LHA of the
body. Find the LHA of the body for this position.

9.10.4. Select the correct volume (2 or 3) and page that contains the correct arguments of Dec and LHA
of the body, temporarily disregarding the odd additional minutes of Dec. Thus, if the Dec were N19o55',
use the column for 19o. Select the table labeled Declination Same Name as Latitude, if Dec and latitude
are both north or both south, or select the table labeled Declination Contrary Name to Latitude, if one is
north and the other south. Opposite the LHA of the body, read the tabulated altitude, d-value, and Zn in
the column headed by the whole degrees of Dec.

9.10.5. If the Dec is not a whole number of degrees, determine the correction for the additional minutes
of Dec. Enter the table in the Pub. No. 249 volume with the value d and the number of additional
minutes of Dec. Apply the correction to the tabulated altitude (Hc) according to the sign of d. This is the
corrected Hc.

9.10.6. Convert azimuth angle (Z) to true azimuth (Zn) by means of the rule at the top or bottom of the
page.

9.10.7. This completes the solution for the Dec tables. Keep in mind this solution is computed after the
observation. Because of the speeds involved in air navigation, we will explain a way to compute the
solution before the shot in the next chapter.

Section 9Câ€”Precession and Nutation

9.11. Basics. The earth's axis does not maintain a fixed direction in space. Actually, the earth is like a
slow running gyro that is wobbling. There are several separate patterns that the wobble makes. Some of
those patterns have short cycles, while others take hundreds of years to complete. Two of the many
patterns are shown in Figure 9.9. One involves small nodding motions while at the same time
completing a larger circular path. You must use a correction called precession and nutation to account
for these variations in the apparent position of the stars. This correction is applied only to celestial LOPs
determined with Pub. No. 249, Volume 1.
226                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 9.9. Earth's Axis Wobble.




9.12. Precession. Because of the equatorial bulge, the attractive forces of other solar system bodies,
principally the moon, are unbalanced about the center of the earth. The imbalance is directed toward
aligning the equator with the plane of the ecliptic. However, the rotation of the earth transforms this
force into an effect acting 90o away in the direction of rotationâ€”a precessional effect. The result is that
the poles travel in a conical path westward around the ecliptic poles, as shown in Figure 9.10 (the point
90o from the ecliptic). Consequently, the points of intersection of the equator with the ecliptic, or the
equinoxes, travel in a westerly direction along the ecliptic. This travel is called precession of the
equinoxes, and it amounts to approximately five-sixths (5/6) of a minute (50.26") annually. The
equinoxes complete one revolution along the ecliptic in approximately 25,800 years. The equator is used
as a reference for Dec and its movement, due to precession of the equinoxes, causes slight changes in the
celestial coordinates of the stars, which otherwise appear fixed in space.

9.13. Nutation. As the relative positions and distances from the earth to the sun, moon, and planets vary
so does the rate of precession. The only variation of importance in navigation is nutation. Nutation is a
nodding of the poles, one oscillation occurring in about 18.6 years.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                        227

Figure 9.10. Precession of the Equinoxes.




9.13.1. In Figure 9.11, you can see that if the stars remain fixed and the equinoctial moves up and down,
the Dec of these bodies is changing.

9.13.2. Nutation, being approximately perpendicular to the ecliptic, has an appreciable influence on Dec.
It is caused by complex gravitational forces among the sun, moon, and earth because the moon's orbit
does not always lie in the plane of the ecliptic. The change in Dec of the celestial bodies caused by the
resulting wobble of the earth's axis is called nutation.

9.14. Position Corrections. Because of precession and nutation, Hc and Zn for a star are accurate only
at the instant, or epoch, at which the LHA and Dec for the computations are correct. A position obtained
at any other time with that Hc and Zn requires a correction. Pub. No. 249, Volume 1, contains Hcs and
Zns calculated for an epoch year (midnight, 1 January, of that year) so, if the volume is used in any other
year, the resultant position must be corrected. The precession and nutation corrections are combined and
given in Pub. No. 249, Volume 1, Table 5.

9.14.1. Entering arguments for the table is year, latitude, and LHA of Aries, and the correction is
presented in the form of a distance and direction to move the fix. The tabulated values show the
distance, parallel to the ecliptic, between the observer's position in the year of the fix and the position in
the epoch year at the latitude and LHA of Aries.

point needs emphasis here: The table is to be used only for observations plotted with the aid of Volume
1, never in conjunction with Volumes 2 or 3.

9.15. Summary. This chapter has dealt with the astronomical triangle and how the Pub. No. 249
volumes you use in resolving the astronomical triangle. We've discussed obtaining solutions involving
celestial bodies using Pub. No. 249, Volumes 1, 2, and 3. Succeeding chapters will discuss plotting of

                                  CELESTIAL PRECOMPUTATION

Section 10Aâ€”Introduction

10.1. Basics. Celestial precomputation is neither new nor revolutionary. The tables necessary to do
precomputation have been available since 1940; however, there was no operational requirement for
precomputation at that time. With present day high-speed aircraft, however, the picture has changed
radically. By "postcomping," a great deal of work must be done after the last celestial observation. The
fix could easily be 15 minutes old by the time it is plotted on the chart. At 450 knots groundspeed (GS),
a fix that is 15 minutes old is over 100 miles behind the aircraft and is of questionable value. Another
factor necessitating precomputation in high-speed aircraft lies in the method of shooting celestial. With
the limited field of view of the sextant, the correct star is difficult to find unless you know where to look.

10.2. Presetting the Sextant. Precomputation greatly reduces both of the problems just mentioned. By
completing most of the computations before shooting, the navigator reduces the time necessary to plot
the fix after the last observation. Also, the problem of finding the star in the optics of the sextant is
simplified. The procedure for finding the star is similar to the heading check performed with the
periscopic sextant, using the true bearing (TB) method as explained in Chapter 12. In this case the true
azimuth (Zn) is set into the sextant mount and the computed altitude (Hc), which will approximate the
sextant altitude (Hs), is set into the sextant. Now, instead of sighting the body to determine the true
heading (TH), set the TH under the vertical crosshair to find the selected body, hopefully very close to
the crosshairs in the sextant field of view. Use the inverse relative bearing (IRB) method to avoid
erroneous settings in the azimuth window and to increase speed in setting up the sextant. In this method,
the azimuth window remains permanently at 000.0o and the IRB is computed by the formula: IRB = TH
â€“ Zn. The body should be found at its computed altitude when its IRB appears under the crosshairs.

Section 10Bâ€”Precomputation Techniques

10.3. Basics. There are many acceptable methods of precomputation in general usage. However, these
methods are basically either graphical, mathematical, or a combination of both methods. Selection is
largely based on individual navigator preference and assigned command.

10.3.1. Celestial corrections which are used in precomputation include atmospheric refraction, parallax
of the moon, instrument and acceleration errors, Coriolis and rhumb line, precession and nutation,
motion of the observer, and wander. With precomputation, new corrections and terminology are
introduced, which include fix time, solution time, observation time, scheduled time, and motion of the
body adjustment.

10.3.2. Fix time is the time for which the LOPs are resolved and plotted on the chart. Solution time is the
time for which the astronomical triangle is solved. Observation time is the midtime of the actual
observation for each celestial body. Scheduled time is the time for which the astronomical triangle is
solved for each LOP in the graphic method. Motion of the body correction is used to correct for the
changing altitude of the selected bodies from shot to fix time and may be applied either graphically or
mathematically.
230                                                                 AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

10.4. Motion of the Body Correction. Motion of the body correction can be applied graphically by
moving the assumed position eastward or westward for time. This is possible because the Greenwich
hour angle (GHA) and the subpoint of the body move westward at the rate of 1o of longitude per 4
minutes of time. In the graphic method, a scheduled time of observation is given to each body. If
shooting is off schedule, the following rules apply: For every minute of time that the shot is taken early,
move the assumed position 15' of longitude to the east; for every minute of time that the shot is taken
late, move the assumed position 15' of longitude to the west.

10.4.1. When the latitude of the assumed position and the Zn of the body are known, the motion of the
body can be computed mathematically. For 1 minute, the formula is: 15(cos lat)/(sin Zn). This correction
is shown in tabular form in Figure 10.1. In Pub. No. 249, the local hour angle (LHA) increases 1o in 4
minutes of time. Thus, the Hc for an LHA that is 1o less than the LHA used for precomputation is the Hc
for 4 minutes of time earlier than the solution time. The difference between the two Hcs is the value to
apply to the Hc or Hs to advance or retard the line of position (LOP) for 4 minutes of time. If the Hc
decreases (Zn greater than 180o), the body is setting and the sign is minus to advance the LOP if the
value is applied to the Hs. If the Hc increases (Zn less than 180o), the body is rising and the sign is plus
to advance the LOP if the value is applied to the Hs.

10.4.2. In addition, motion corrections may be determined by using a modified MB-4 computer. This
modification allows for greater accuracy and speed in computation of combined motions (motion of the
observer and motion of the body) than the Pub. No. 249 tables. For a discussion of this modification, see
Chapter 12.

10.5. Special Celestial Techniques. The main difference between the basic methods of precomputation
is the manner in which the motion of the observer and the motion of the body corrections are applied. In
the graphic method, both corrections are applied graphically by movement of the assumed position or
the LOP. In the mathematical method, both corrections are applied mathematically to the Hc, the Hs, or
the intercept after being obtained from tables, a modified MB-4 computer, or the Pub. No. 249.

10.6. Celestial Computation Sheets. The format in Figure 10.2 is a typical celestial precomputation and
illustrates one acceptable method of completing a precomputation. The explanation is numbered to help
locate the various blocks on the celestial sheets (Figure 10.2). NOTE: Not all blocks apply on every
precomputation.

10.7. Corrections Applied to Hc. In some methods of precomputation, corrections are applied in
advance to the Hc to derive an adjusted Hc. When using corrections that are normally applied to Hs, the
signs of the corrections are reversed if applied to Hc. For example:

      Corrections Applied to Hs
      Hs                31o 05
      REFR                  -01
      PERS/SEXT             -05
      Ho                30o 59
      Hc                30o 40
      INT                  19T

      Corrections Applied to Hc

      Hc                30o 40
      REFR                +01
      PERS/SEXT           +05
      ADJ Hc            30o 46
      Hs                31o 05
      INT                 19T

10.7.1. This example demonstrates that corrections may be applied to either Hs or Hc. As long as they
are applied with the proper sign, the intercept remains the same. The following sample precomp uses a
common fix time (though computation times are different) and common observation times to facilitate
comparison. NOTE: Atmospheric refraction correction must be extracted for the actual Hs. It may then
be applied to either Hc or Hs using the proper sign. Extracting the value for Hc may cause large errors,
especially when the body is near the horizon. Figure 10.3 is a sample three-star precomputation using
the mathematical format. Corrections to altitude of the body are applied to the Hc and the sign of the
correction has been reversed in this process, so the fix can be plotted prior to the computation time. All
shots are early shots, allowing the navigator to resolve the fix and alter at fix time. However, any minor
errors in interpolation for motions are multiplied for the two earliest shots and may cause inaccuracies in
the fix.

10.7.2. Figure 10.4 shows a three-star precomputation using a three-LHA or graphical solution. The
assumed position will then be moved for track and groundspeed to accommodate LOPs shot off time.
Each observation is taken on time and then plotted out of its own plotting position. This precomp is
easier and faster to accomplish with relatively few opportunities for math errors to occur. The three
assumed positions required for this solution, on the other hand, often cause large intercepts and may
make star identification difficult if care is not taken in choosing the precomp assumed position.

10.8. Limitations. Precomputational methods lose accuracy when the assumed position and the actual
position differ by large distances. Another limiting factor is the difference in time between the scheduled
and actual observation time. The motion of the body correction is intended to correct for this difference.
The rate of change of the correction for motion of the body changes very slowly within 40o of 090o and
270o Zn and the observation may be advanced or retarded for a limited period of time with little or no
error. When the body is near the observer's meridian, however, the correction for motion of the body
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                     237

changes rapidly due in part to the fast azimuth change and it's inadvisable to adjust such observations for
long (over 6 minutes) periods of time. NOTE: Errors in altitude and azimuth creep into the solution if
adjustments are made for too long an interval of time. Because of these errors, the navigator should
attempt to keep observation time as close as possible to computation time.

Section 10Câ€”Preplotting True Azimuth (Zn)

10.9. Basics. To speed up fix resolution, some navigators preplot the Zns of the bodies. This technique
works best when used on a constant scale chart and using a technique of precomputation that will give
one assumed position. Before making any observations, plot the assumed position, correct it for Coriolis
and precession and/or nutation (if required) and draw the Zns of the bodies through this point. Label
each Zn as the 1st, 2d, or 3d as shown in Figure 10.5, or use the name of the bodies. Use arrowheads to
identify the direction of the body. Suppose the corrected assumed position is 30o40' N, 117o10' W and
the following Zns were computed for the bodies:

   1st shot Zn 020o
   2d shot Zn 135o
   3d shot Zn 270o

The original assumed position of 31o N; 117o08' W has been corrected for precession and/or nutation and
for Coriolis or rhumb line error to obtain the plotting position. When the first intercept is found to be
10A, second intercept 40A, and the third intercept 50T, the fix may be plotted quickly by constructing
perpendicular lines at the correct point on the respective Zn line. This greatly reduces the time necessary
to plot the fix.

10.10. Summary. Celestial precomputation methods have been brought to the forefront with the
proliferation of high-speed aircraft. Aircraft speeds make it necessary to minimize the time between
shooting and fixing. Since the sextant may be the only means of viewing the body, it is necessary to
precompute the altitude and azimuth of a body in order to locate it. Remember corrections may be
applied to the Hc, Ho, or intercept, and pay close attention to the sign of the correction. In addition to
precomputation, the fix may be resolved faster by preplotting the true azimuths of the bodies.

          PLOTTING AND INTERPRETING THE CELESTIAL LINE OF POSITION

Section 11Aâ€”Introduction

11.1. Basics. This chapter explains the methods that transform the tabulated and in-flight observation
values into an aircraft position. The navigator is faced with two tasks: plotting the resultant information
onto a chart and resolving this information into an aircraft position. There are two basic methods of
obtaining a line of position (LOP): the subpoint method and the intercept method.

11.2. Subpoint Method (Figure 11.1). A detailed explanation of the theory concerning this method is in
Chapters 9 and 10.


Figure 11.1. The Subpoint Method.




11.2.1. Here is a summary of the steps involved:

11.2.1.1. Positively identify the body and measure the altitude using a sextant.

11.2.1.2. Because no tabulated information for azimuth or elevation is required for this method,
corrections for refraction, parallax, semidiameter, wander error, and sextant correction are applied
directly to the Ho.

11.2.1.3. The resultant measurement is subtracted from 90o to obtain the co-altitude (co-alt). To convert
to NM (1o=60 NM), multiply the number of degrees times 60. Any fractional portion of degrees is added
to the previous value.

11.2.2. Example: Vega is observed at an altitude (Ho) of 88o23'. Sextant correction is -03'.

   88o23' â€“ 03' = 88o20'
   90o â€“ 88o20' = 1o40'
   1o 40' = 60' + 40' = 100 NM
240                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

11.2.3. In this example, 100 NM represents the distance from the observer's position to the subpoint of
the body. The coordinates of the body are its corresponding declination (Dec) and Greenwich hour angle
(GHA). For this example, Vega's Dec is N38o46'. The GHA is obtained by applying the sidereal hour
angle (SHA) of Vega to the GHA of Aries.

      EXAMPLE:
         SHA = 080o59'
         GHA Aries = 039o18'
         GHA Vega = 120o17'

11.2.4. Subpoint of Vega is located at 38o46' N l20o17' W. The observer is now ready to apply the
information:

11.2.4.1. Plot the subpoint on an appropriate chart.

11.2.4.2. With dividers or compass, span the co-alt distance; in this case 100 NM.

11.2.4.3. Use the body's subpoint (38o46' N l20o17' W) as the center and 100 NM (co-alt) as the radius.
The circle is called the circle of equal altitude and the observer is located on that portion of the circle
nearest the DR position. There are definite advantages to this method. It requires no precomp values and
plotting is very simple if the observer and body are reasonably close together. When the observer and
body are separated by great distances, some disadvantages appear.

11.2.5. If a body is observed at 20o above the horizon, the observer is 4,200 NM from its subpoint. To
swing a LOP from this subpoint, the subpoint and the arc must be plotted on the same chart. To permit
plotting of any LOP, the chart must cover an area extending more than 4,000 miles in every direction
from the DR position. This means that the chart must be either of such large size that it cannot be spread
out on a table in the aircraft, or of such small scale that plotting on it is inaccurate. To cover an area
8,000 miles across, a chart 4 feet square must be drawn to a scale of about 1:10,000,000. Furthermore,
measuring would be difficult because of distortion.

11.2.6. Since a celestial LOP cannot always be drawn by the subpoint method, the intercept method,
based on the same principles, is often used.

11.3. Intercept Technique:

11.3.1. Intercept Method (Figure 11.2). You can eliminate the need for plotting the body's subpoint
and still draw the arc representing the circle of equal altitude. By using the following formula, you can
calculate the altitude and azimuth of the body for the DR position:

        Hc = SIN-1 [SIN (DEC') SIN (LDr)
                          +COS (DEC')COS (LDr) COS (LHA)]
        Z = COS (Z) = [SIN (DEC')
                          â€“ SIN (LDR) SIN (HC)]/[COS (Hc COS (LDr)]

        Zn = Z if SIN (LHA) < 0
        Zn = 360 â€“ Z if SIN (LHA) > 0

Figure 11.2. Line of Position Computed by Intercept Method.




11.3.2. The calculations may be performed quickly, using a programmable calculator, or they may be
extracted from the appropriate volume of Pub. No. 249. This method enables the observer to use any of
the navigational bodies available at the appropriate fix time. Here is a brief review:

11.3.2.1. Compute a DR for the time of the position, using preflight or in-flight data.

11.3.2.2. Determine the necessary entering values for the Pub. 249 volume being used (Lat, LHA, Dec
contrary or same) and extract all the necessary values of computed altitude (Hc), azimuth angle (Z), etc.

11.3.2.3. After making all the necessary conversions and corrections (Chapter 10), compare the Ho and
corrected Hc. This difference is the intercept. If the Ho equals the corrected Hc, then the circle of equal
altitude passed through the plotting position. If the Ho is greater than the Hc, the difference is plotted in
the direction of the true azimuth (Zn). The Zn represents the azimuth from the observer's position to the
subpoint. If the Ho is less than the Hc, plot the difference 180o from the Zn.

NOTE: If HO is MOre, plot TOward the subpoint ( HO MO TO )

11.3.2.4. Example: The assumed position is 38o N, 121o30' W for a shot taken at 1015Z on Aldebaran.
The Ho is 32o14'. The Hc is determined to be 32o29' and the Zn 120o. A comparison of Ho and Hc
determines the intercept to be 15 NM away (15A).

11.4. Plotting LOP Using Zn Method (Figure 11.3):

11.4.1. Plot the assumed position and set the intercept distance on the dividers.

11.4.2. Draw a dashed line through the assumed position toward the subpoint.

11.4.3. Span intercept distance along dashed Zn line.

11.4.4. Place plotter perpendicular to Zn.

11.4.5. Draw LOP along plotter as shown.

11.5. Plotting LOP Using Flip-Flop Method (Figure 11.4):

11.5.1. Plot the assumed position and set the intercept distance on the dividers.

11.5.2. Measure 120o of the Zn with point A of the dividers on the assumed position and place point B
of the dividers down, in this case, away from 120o or in the direction of 300o from the assumed position.
Slide the plotter along the dividers until the center grommet and the 100/200-mile mark are lined up
directly over point B of the dividers marking the intercept point.

11.5.3. Remove point A of the dividers from the assumed position, keeping point B in place. Flip point
A (that was on the assumed position) across the plotter, at the same time expanding the dividers so that
point A can be placed on the chart at the 90o/270o mark of the plotter.

11.5.4. Flop the plotter around and place the straight edge against the perpendicular, which is established
by the dividers.

11.5.5. Draw LOP along the plotter as shown.

11.6. Summary of Intercept Method. When using the intercept method, remember:

11.6.1. For some assumed position near the DR position, find the Hc and Zn of this body for the time of
the observation. This is done with the aid of celestial tables, such as Pub. No. 249, or a programmable
calculator.

11.6.2. Obtain needed corrections, sextant correction, refraction, etc., and apply these to the Hc by
reversing the sign (remember, we are striving to derive a precomputed value to ensure the correct body
is shot). Measure the altitude (Ho) of the celestial body with the sextant and record the midtime of the
observation.

11.6.3. Find the intercept, which is the difference between Ho and Hc. Intercept is toward the subpoint if
Ho is greater than Hc and away from the subpoint if Ho is smaller than Hc.

11.6.4. From the assumed position, measure the intercept toward or away from the subpoint (in the
direction of Zn or its reciprocal) and locate a point on the LOP. Through this point, draw the LOP
perpendicular to the Zn.

11.7. Additional Plotting Techniques. The preceding techniques involve the basic plotting procedures
used on most stars and the bodies of the solar system. However, there are certain techniques of plotting
that are peculiar to their own celestial methods; for example, the plotting of LOPs obtained by using
Polaris, which is discussed later. Also, certain precomputation techniques lend themselves more readily
to other plotting techniques, such as preplotting the true azimuths or plotting the fix on the DR
computer.

11.7.1. These last plotting techniques are discussed in Pub. No. 249 in the section on precomputation.

11.7.2. Other special techniques are discussed in the section on curves, in which the celestial observation
is plotted on a graph rather than on the chart.

Section 11Bâ€”Interpretation of an LOP

11.8. Basics. Navigation has two aspectsâ€” the mechanical and the interpretive. The mechanical aspect
includes operation and reading of instruments, simple arithmetical calculations, plotting, and log
keeping. The interpretive aspect is the analysis of the data that have been gathered mechanically. These
data are variable and subject to error. You must convert them into probabilities as to the position, track,
and GS of the aircraft and the direction and speed of the wind. The more these data are subject to error,
the more careful the interpretations must be and the less mechanical the work can be. LOPs and fixes
especially require careful interpretation. It is convenient to think of a fix as the true position of the
aircraft and of the LOP as a line passing through this position, but these definitions are optimistic. It is
almost impossible to make a perfect observation and plot a perfect LOP. Therefore, an LOP passes some
place near this position, but not necessarily through it and a fix determined by the intersection of LOPs
is simply the best estimate of this position on the basis of one set of observations. Thus, in reality, a fix
is a most probable position (MPP) and a LOP is a line of MPP.

11.8.1. The best interpretation of LOPs and fixes means they are used, to the best advantage, with DR.
But good interpretation cannot compensate for poor LOPs, nor can good LOPs compensate for careless
DR. To get good results, every precaution must be taken to ensure the accuracy of LOPs and exact DR
calculations.

11.8.2. Intelligent interpretation requires fine judgment, which can only be acquired from experience.
You can be guided, however, by certain well-established, though flexible, rules.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       245

11.8.3. The following discussion pertains especially to celestial LOPs and fixes. It also applies to LOPs
and fixes established by radio and, to some extent, to those obtained by map reading.

11.9. Single LOP. Previous discussions dealt with the basic plotting of an LOP and errors in LOPs, but
they did not show the actual mechanics of the plotted corrections which must be applied. The LOP must
be corrected for Coriolis or rhumb line correction and also for precession and/or nutation correction if it
is based on a Volume 1 star shot. Coriolis or rhumb line correction becomes a very significant correction
at higher speeds and latitudes. For example, suppose the correction determined from the Coriolis or
rhumb line correction table is 9 NM right (of the track). The LOP must be moved a distance of 9 NM to
the right of track. This can be done either by moving the assumed position prior to plotting, or by
moving the LOP itself after it is plotted. (Remember the assumed position is not used in the plotting of
the LOP obtained from a Polaris observation.) Consider Figure 11.5, which shows a track of 90o.


Figure 11.5. Two Methods of Coriolis/Rhumb Line Correction.




11.9.1. Notice that, in both methods, the corrected LOP is in the same place with respect to the original
assumed position and that the intercept value is the same. The resultant LOP is the same regardless of
the method used.

11.9.2. If, in addition to the Coriolis or rhumb line correction, a precession and/or nutation correction of
3 NM in the direction of 60o is required, it would have been further applied as shown in Figure 11.6.
Again, the corrected LOP is the same, using either method, because the intercept and resultant position
of the corrected LOP to the original assumed position are the same. The corrected LOP alone gives very
little information; hence, a position must be arrived at only after considering the LOP and the DR
position for the same time.
246                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

11.10. Most Probable Position (MPP) by C-Plot. The MPP is just what the name implies. It is not a
fix; however, since it is the best information available, it is treated as such. Notice in A of Figure 11.7
that the DR position and celestial LOP (for the same time) do not coincide.

Figure 11.7. Most Probable Position by C-Plot.




11.10.1. Obviously, the DR information or celestial information, or both is in error. Notice that the prior
fix has no time on it. Suppose this prior fix had been for the time of 1010. It would then be very likely
that most of the error is in the celestial information and the probable position is closer to the DR position
than to the celestial LOP. On the other hand, suppose the prior fix had been for the time of 0900. Since
the accuracy of the celestial information is unaffected by the time from the last fix, it would, in this case,
be most likely that the actual position is closer to the LOP than to the DR position.

11.10.2. A formula has been devised to position the observer along the perpendicular to the LOP
according to the time factor. The formula is:
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      247




where t is time in minutes, p is the perpendicular distance between the DR position and the LOP and d is
the distance from the DR position for the time of the MPP measured along the perpendicular to the LOP.
Look at B and C of Figure 11.7 and see how the formula works for the two problems cited above if the
perpendicular is 20 NM in length. In B of Figure 11.7, t is 15 minutes and p is 20 NM, so the MPP
would be located along the perpendicular about 8Â½ NM from the DR position.




11.10.3. Now, consider C in Figure 11.7 where t is 1 hour 25 minutes or 85 minutes, p is 20 NM and in
this case, the MPP would be over 16 NM away from the DR position along the perpendicular to the
LOP.




11.10.4. If you prefer not to use the formula, a simple table can be easily constructed to solve for d with
entering arguments of t and p as shown in Figure 11.8. The table could easily be enlarged to handle
larger values of t and p. In most fixes, the DR position is so close to the LOP that the midpoint between
these two can be considered the MPP. A good rule to use is to take the midpoint of the perpendicular if
the total distance between the DR position and the LOP is 10 NM or less. If the value of p is greater than
10 NM, use a table or the formula to determine the MPP. Up to this point, determination of the MPP has
been rather mechanical. Experienced navigators will frequently further adjust the position of the MPP
for other factors not yet considered. For example, if the LOP is carefully obtained under good conditions
or if it is the average of several LOPs, you may further weight the MPP in the direction of the LOP by
an amount that judgment dictates. However, the reverse may be true if the LOP is obtained under
adverse conditions of rough air. In the latter case, you might move the MPP closer to the DR position by
some amount determined by sound judgment.


Figure 11.8. To Solve for Distance.
248                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

11.10.5. Further, consider the validity of the DR position in relation to factors other than time. A DR
position at the end of 40 minutes would be more reliable with Doppler drift and GS versus one based on
metro information. These factors may also adjust the original MPP closer to or farther away from the
DR position, along the perpendicular. However, these last mentioned factors are judgment values that
come only with experience. In fact, with experience you may mentally calculate all the factors involved
and arrive at the final position of the MPP without recourse to a formula or table.

11.11. Finding a Celestial Fix Point. Up to this point, only the single celestial LOP and what to do with
it have been considered. Now, the celestial fix should be considered. To establish a fix, two or more
LOPs must be obtained. Since, in most cases, two or more LOPs cannot be obtained simultaneously,
they must be converted to a common time. For example, a LOP obtained at 1010 must be converted to
the LOP obtained at the fix time of 1014. There are several methods for making this conversion, which
are discussed in this chapter. Consideration is also given to the planning of the fix and the final
interpretation of the fix itself.

Section 11Câ€”Conversion of LOPs To A Common Time

11.12. Moving the LOP. One method of converting LOPs to a common time is to move the LOP along
the best-known track for the number of minutes of GS necessary for the time conversions. This method
is similar to that used for correcting for Coriolis or rhumb line and precession or nutation. For example,
suppose the track is 110o and the GS 300 knots. LOPs are for 1500, 1504, and 1508 and a fix is desired
at 1508. This means the 1500 LOP must be moved to the time of the fix, using the track and 8 minutes
of the best known GS. The 1504 LOP must be moved to the time of the fix, using the track and 4
minutes of GS. The 1508 LOP is already at the fix time, so it requires no movement. Figure 11.9 shows
the method of conversion as it is completed on the chart.


Figure 11.9. Conversion of Lines of Position to a Common Time.




11.12.1. If, at any time, the LOP has to be retarded (moved back) to the time of the fix, use the following
procedures. Using the reciprocal track and GS, obtain the correction in the regular manner for the
number of minutes of difference. For example, suppose the fix is at 1800 and the last shot is at 1802.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       249

11.12.2. Retarding the LOP 2 minutes of GS on a track of 70o would be the same as advancing it 2
minutes of GS on a track of 250o.

11.13. Motion of Observer Tables. A second method of conversion of LOPs to a common time is with
a Motion of the Observer table such as the one in Pub. No. 249. This table gives a correction to be
applied to the Ho or Hc so that the LOP plots in its converted position. The correction obtained from
Table 1 in all volumes of Pub. No. 249 is for 4 minutes of time. An additional table allows you to get the
correction for the number of minutes needed.

11.13.1. For example, suppose the LOP needs to be advanced for 11 minutes and the Ho of the body is
33o 29' and Zn is 080o. The track of the aircraft is 020o and the GS is 240 knots. In Table 1, Correction
for Motion of the Observer for 4 minutes of Time (Figure 11.10), the entering arguments is Rel Zn and
GS. Rel Zn is azimuth relative to course (Zn minus track or track minus Zn). Subtract the smaller angle
from the larger and enter the table with the answer. In this case, Zn â€“ track = 080o â€“ 020o = 060o (Rel
Zn) and GS is 240 knots. Entering this table with these arguments, the correction listed is +08' for 4
minutes of time.

11.13.2. Use the whiz wheel to calculate the total motion for 11 minutes. In this case, the 11-minute
correction totals 22'. By applying any other correction (refraction, sextant correction), a total adjustment
is derived. By changing the sign, this total may be applied to the Hc. To apply the correction to the Ho,
the sign of the adjustment would remain the same. Apply the adjustment to the intercept as the rules
state in Table 1. In each case, the resultant intercept would be the same.

11.13.3. Suppose the Hc was 33o57'. Applying the correction -22 yields 33o35'. Comparing this with our
Ho 33o29' results in an intercept of 6 NM away. If you decide to apply the correction to the Ho, 33o29' +
22' yields 33o5l'. Comparing this to the Hc 33o57' yields the same result, 6 NM away. When using the
Motion of the Observer table and when the fix time is earlier than the observation (LOP to be retarded),
the rule for the sign of the correction is also printed below Table 1.

11.14. Moving the Assumed Position. Another method of converting LOPs to a common time is to
move the assumed position. This method is recommended for shots 4 minutes apart computed to give all
three bodies a single assumed position. However, it is not limited to that type of computation. The
assumed position is moved along the best-known track at the best-known GS. For example, again
suppose the track is 330o and the GS 300 knots. LOPs are for 1500, 1504, and 1508 and a fix is desired
at 1508 (Figure 11.11). Since the first LOP would have to be advanced 40 NM (8 min at 300 knots), the
same result is realized by advancing the assumed position 40 NM parallel to the best-known track. The
1504 LOP must be advanced 20 NM; therefore, the assumed position is advanced 20 NM miles parallel
to the best-known track. The third shot requires no movement and it is plotted from the original assumed
position. It should be noted that the first shot is always plotted from the assumed position, which is
closest to destination. In this method, if observations are precomputed and the assumed position is
moved prior to shooting, the following procedure is used when shooting is off schedule. For every
minute of time that the shot is taken early, move the assumed position 15 minutes of longitude to the
east. For every minute of time that the shot is taken late, move the assumed position 15 minutes of
longitude to the west. In addition, the affected LOP must be moved along the best-known track for the
number of minutes of GS the observation was early or late. If the shot was early, advance the LOP; if the
shot was late, retard the LOP.

11.15. Planning the Fix. In selecting bodies for observation, one should generally consider azimuth
primarily and such factors as brightness, altitude, etc., secondarily. If all observations were precisely
correct in every detail, the resulting LOPs would meet at a point. However, this is rarely the case. Three
observations generally result in LOPs forming a triangle. If this triangle is not more than 2 or 3 miles on
a side under good conditions and 5 to 10 miles under unfavorable conditions, there is normally no reason
to suppose that a mistake has been made. Even a point fix, however, is not necessarily accurate. An
uncorrected error in time, for instance, would require the entire fix to be moved eastward if observations
were early and westward if observations were late, at the rate of 1 minute of longitude for each 4
seconds of time.

11.15.1. In a two-LOP fix, the ideal cut of the LOPs is 90o. In Figure 11.12, a 90o cut with a 5 NM error
in one LOP will cause a 5 NM error in the fix. If the acute angle between the LOPs is 30o, a 5 NM error
in one LOP will cause a 10 NM error in the fix. Thus, with a two-LOP fix, an error in one LOP will
cause at least an equal error in the fix; the smaller the acute angle between the LOPs, the greater the fix
error caused by a given error in one LOP. Of course, if both LOPs are in error, the fix may be thrown off
even more. In a three-LOP fix, the ideal cut of the LOPs is 60o (star azimuths 120o apart). With this cut,
a 3 NM error in any one LOP will cause a 2 NM error in the fix. With any other cut, a 3 NM error in any
one LOP will cause more than a 2 NM error in the fix. In a three-star fix, the cut will be 60o if the
azimuths of the stars differ by 60o or if they differ by 120o. If there is any unknown constant error in the
observations, all the Hos will be either too great or too small. Notice in Figure 11.13 that, if stars are
selected whose azimuths differ by 120o, this constant error of the Hos will cause a displacement of the
three LOPs, either all toward the center or all away from the center of the triangle. In either case, the
position of the center of the triangle will not be affected. If you use any three stars with azimuths outside
a 180o range, any constant error in observations will tend to cancel out.
252                                                                AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

Figure 11.12. Effect of Cut on Accuracy of a Fix.




Figure 11.13. Effect of Azimuth on Accuracy of Fix.




11.15.2. The three-star fix has two distinct advantages over the two-star fix. First, it is the average of
three observations. Second, selecting the stars carefully can counteract the effect of constant errors of
observation. There is also a third advantage. Each pair of two LOPs furnishes a rough check on the third.
In resolving an observation into a LOP, you might possibly make a gross error; for example, obtaining
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        253

an LHA which is in error by a whole degree. Such an error might not be immediately apparent. Neither
would such a discrepancy come to immediate attention in a two-LOP fix. However, this third advantage
does not apply when a single LHA is used in solving all LOPs, such as is done when precomputing and
using motion corrections to resolve all LOPs to a common time. Because of these three advantages, it is
evident that a three-star fix should be used, rather than a two-star fix, when possible.

11.15.3. Whatever the number of observations, common practice, backed by logic, is to take the center
of the figure formed unless there is reason for deviating from this procedure. Center is meant as the
point representing the least total error of all lines considered reliable. With three LOPs, the center is
considered that point, within the triangle equidistant from the three sides. It may be found by bisecting
the angles, but is usually located by eye.

11.16. Summary. Because of all the factors involved, a certain amount of judgment is necessary, along
with the proper use of the mechanics comprising celestial navigation. When using a single LOP or a fix,
you have to take into consideration the existing conditions and weigh the DR information against the
information obtained from the LOP. An accurate DR position should always be computed.

11.16.1. The C-Plot formula helps place the MPP with a single LOP, but you might want to make further
adjustments to the final position. The formula is:




11.16.2. Remember, d is the distance measured along a perpendicular from the DR position to the LOP.
In the case of the two- or three-star fix, planning plays a very important part. Selecting stars whose
azimuths differ by 120o for a three-star fix will minimize errors in the fix position. In two-star fixes, the
ideal azimuth separation is 90o. Also, when dealing with more than one LOP, it is necessary to resolve
the LOPs to a common time. This adjustment can be accomplished by moving the assumed position, by
moving the LOPs, or by applying a correction factor to the Hc or Ho.

Section 12Aâ€”Introduction

12.1. Basics. This chapter has some techniques which may not be used every day and under all
circumstances but are valuable alternatives from normal precomping procedures. Most of these
techniques save time by eliminating either some extractions or computations. Some navigational
techniques and planning procedures are also discussed.

12.2. Determining Availability of Celestial Bodies. By doing a quick comparison of GHA to the
observer's position, it is easy to determine the availability of celestial bodies. For example, the observer
anticipates being at 18o N 135o W at 0015Z on 28 September 1995. There are several bodies listed in the
Air Almanac, but not all of them are available for observation. To determine availability, take the
observer's longitude and look 80o either side of it. Within this range, compare the GHA of a body.
Looking at Figure 12.1 we see that the sun, moon, Venus, and Jupiter are within the 80o range and are
therefore usable. Saturn is outside of the 80o range so it is not usable. The declination of a body is not
normally a factor; however, at high latitudes a body may not be available when its subpoint is near the
pole opposite the observer.


Figure 12.1. A Quick Check of Body Availability.




12.3. Latitude by Polaris. Polaris is the polestar, or North Star. Because Polaris is approximately 1o
from the North Pole, it makes a small diurnal circle and seemingly stays in about the same place all
night. This fact makes Polaris very useful in navigation. With certain corrections, it serves as a reference
point for direction and for latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. Latitude by Polaris is a quick method of
obtaining a latitude line of position (LOP); only the tables given in the Air Almanac are needed.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       255

12.3.1. Obtaining Latitude by Polaris. A latitude by Polaris LOP is obtained by applying the "Q"
correction (Figure 12.2) to the corrected observed altitude. This adjusts the altitude of the pole, which is
equal to the navigator's latitude. The Q correction table is in the back of the Air Almanac. The entering
argument for the table is exact local hour angle (LHA) of Aries. The effect of refraction is not included
in Q correction, so the observed altitude must be fully corrected. When refraction is used for a latitude
by Polaris LOP, it is applied to the observed altitude and the sign of the correction is negative. A Polaris
LOP can also be plotted using the intercept method. In this case, the Hc is computed by reversing the
sign of the Q correction and applying it to the assumed latitude (rounded off to the nearest degree).
Refraction is positive when applied to get an Hc for the intercept method.

12.3.2. Obtaining Azimuth of Polaris. For either method, the azimuth of Polaris is obtained from the
Azimuth of Polaris table found in the Air Almanac or in the Pub. No. 249 (Figure 12.2). Whether plotted
as an intercept or a latitude, the assumed position should be corrected for Coriolis or rhumb line and
precession or nutation. The resulting LOPs should fall in the same place for either method. To plot the
LOP using the latitude method, choose the longitude line closest to the DR and plot perpendicular to the
longitude line. For the intercept method, use the assumed latitude and plot the intercept normally using
the azimuth of Polaris.

use the exact latitude and longitude. See Figure 12.3 for plotting.

NOTE: If the Q correction table in Volume 1 is used, precession and nutation (P/N) and Coriolis or
rhumb line must be used in plotting the LOP. This is because the Pub. No. 249 covers a 5-year period
and the further the years get from the Epoch year, the greater the error is when using the Polaris table.
P/N compensates for this error.

12.4. LHA Method of Obtaining Three-Star Fix. The LHA technique allows you to solve the motion
problem for a three-star fix by applying a correction to the assumed position rather than computing a
numerical solution on the precomp. This eliminates mathematical motion calculations, therefore
reducing the chance of math errors on the precomp. To accomplish a three-LHA fix, you must plan 4
minutes between the midtime of each shot (Figures 12.4 and 12.5). Because LHA changes 1 degree for
every 4 minutes, the precomp will have three successive LHAs, 1 degree apart. To correct for off-time
motion, adjust the assumed position based on true course and groundspeed. If a shot is planned earlier
than fix time, the assumed position is advanced (down-track). For shots planned later than fix time, the
assumed position is retarded (up-track).

12.4.1. The example in Figures 12.4 and 12.5 shows the LHA method for a 12-8-4 early shooting
schedule. This shooting schedule allows the fix and/or MPP to be resolved before the fix time. To adjust
the assumed positions, plot the fix time assumed position and then advance it for 4 minutes of track and
groundspeed for each body. This will satisfy motion of the observer. When shooting the selected bodies,
take care to shoot them exactly on the prescribed times. This will eliminate motion of the body.

12.4.2. A variation of advancing the assumed position is to use half motions. This will enable you to plot
all three LOPs from one assumed position. Table 1 from Pub. No. 249 lists corrections to position of the
observer. Each correction is for 4 minutes of time. To use it, enter with your relative Zn (Zn-Track) and
groundspeed. Now look at the bottom of the table and note you can apply this correction to your
tabulated altitude or observed altitude. It doesn't matter which you choose but note that the sign will
change dependent on where you apply it. Now take the number and multiply it by the 4-minute
increment of the shot. For example, Figure 12.6 shows the precomp for a 0300 fix using 3 LHAs and
half motions. The 0248 shot, Alpheratz, relative Zn, and groundspeed were used to extract a +20
correction from Table 1. Because this shot is 12 minutes early we need to multiply +20 by three before
we apply it to the shot. Note the +60 correction was applied to the observed altitude and therefore kept
its positive sign. The benefit of doing this is a reduction in plotting. See Figure 12.7 for the plotted
LOPs. This technique can be applied to day celestial as well.

Section 12Câ€”Daytime Celestial Techniques

12.5. Basics. Daytime fixing, using celestial techniques, is rather limited because often only one body,
the sun, is visible. Ordinarily, three LOPs cannot be obtained for a fix from one body because the LOPs
plot nearly parallel to each other.

12.6. The Sun Heading Shot at High Noon. The azimuth of the sun changes very rapidly when the
subpoint of the sun is directly over the longitude of the observer, i.e., called the time of transit. The LHA
at transit time is 360o. This phenomenon is more pronounced at lower latitudes as the subpoint of the sun
passes closer to the observer. This makes it extremely difficult to get an accurate celestial heading shot
at the transit time. Therefore, if you need a heading shot near the time of transit, you must take extra
precaution to get the heading observation exactly at the precomputed fix time. If the moon or Venus is
available, consider using these bodies for an accurate celestial heading. If using the sun, you should
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      263

weigh the increased possibility of an inaccurate heading shot. If the accuracy is questionable, get another
heading shot as the sun's rate of azimuth change slows enough to allow a more accurate shot.

12.7. Intercept Method. The intercept method is normally used in obtaining a noonday fix. If the sun
passes close to the observer's position, within about 4o, the subpoint method of plotting the fix may be
used. This method differs from normal procedures in that three different precomps for three different
times are computed. Because of the rapid change of the sun's azimuth at or near transit, this variation is
necessary. The procedure is:

12.7.1. Determine the time of transit.

12.7.2. Select the LHA before and after transit for which the change in azimuth is 30o or more. Since 1o
of LHA is equal to 4 minutes of time, the difference in transit LHA and the new LHA can be converted
to time in minutes. Thus, the time preceding and following transit can be determined.

12.7.3. Plot the DR positions for times determined in 12.7.2. Select the appropriate assumed positions
necessary for the computation and plotting of the LOPs. The assumed position for time of transit is also
plotted.

12.7.4. Determine the intercepts and azimuth for each LOP. Plot these data from the respective assumed
positions.

12.7.5. Resolve the LOPs to a common time, preferably that of the transit LOP.

NOTE: At 30o N latitude, the linear speed of the sun is approximately 780 knots. Thus, on westerly
headings in high-speed aircraft, the DR distance involved before encountering a 30o change in azimuth
will be considerable.

12.8. Subpoint Method. When the observer is within approximately 4o of the subpoint of the body, the
subpoint method of solution is normally used. This is because the radius of the circle of equal altitude is
so small that a straight line does not approximate the arc and a straight line will not give an accurate
LOP. The procedure is:

12.8.1. Plot the subpoints of the body for the time of the observations (using GHA and/or Dec).

12.8.2. Find the co-altitude of the shots and convert it to NM ([90o â€“ Alt] x 60 NM).

12.8.3. Advance the first subpoint and retard the third along the DR track, using best-known track and
GS.

12.8.4. Set the distance found from the co-altitude and strike it off from the resolved subpoints (with a
compass or pair of dividers). Do this for each observation.

NOTE: The resulting intersection or triangle will give an on-time fix. If the LOPs form a triangle, the
aircraft position is probably within the triangle.
264                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

12.8.5. The subpoint method is convenient because Pub. No. 249 isn't usedâ€”only the Air Almanac. This
method can also be used with a star near your assumed position and may be necessary if, for some
reason, your Volume 1 is unavailable. The stars Dec and GHA are needed to determine if the observer is
within 4o of the subpoint. The Air Almanac may be used to find the Dec and sidereal hour angle (SHA)
of the star. The SHA of the star is added to the GHA of Aries to find the GHA of the star.

12.9. Eliminating Motions with the Bracket Technique. For sun observations, you can eliminate
motion calculations by using a shooting schedule of 3 minutes early, on fix time and 3-minutes late.
With this schedule, the 3-minute early and 3-minute late shots have the same magnitude of motion, but
an opposite sign. Therefore, these motions cancel each other out and do not need to be computed. The
on-time shot has no motions. Therefore, the three intercepts can be averaged for a single LOP. At night,
shooting the same star 4 minutes early and late, with a different star shot on time can employ a similar
method. In this case, the intercepts for the same star's 4-minute early or late shots can be averaged. This
reduces workload, but only two LOPs are obtained.

12.10. DR Computer Modification. Rather than eliminating motions, your DR computer can be
modified so both observer and body motions can be computed at one time, without entry into the Pub.
No. 249. Make a GS and latitude scale as shown in Figure 12.8. After constructing these, the DR
computer can be modified for quick and accurate computations of 1-minute motion adjustments.

12.10.1. Tape the GS scale (0 through 900) along the centerline of the grid scale. Match zero to zero,
300 to 50 and 600 to 100 as shown in Figure 12.8. Then, tape the latitude scale along the zero grid line
so that 90o falls on the centerline and the scale extends to the left as shown. Check the accuracy of your
placement: 30o latitude should fall 13 divisions left of centerline. Juggle the scale as necessary to
provide the greatest accuracy between 30o and 45o.

12.10.2. To use the modified MB-4 computer for motion adjustments:

12.10.2.1. Set true north under the index. If computing for grid, set polar angle (PA) under the index. In
the NW and SE hemisphere quadrants PA equals convergence angle (CA). In the NE and SW quadrants

PA=360-CA. Next place the grommet over the zero grid line. Mark a cross (+) at the assumed latitude
(Figure 12.9).

12.10.2.2. Set track (or grid track) under the index and position the slide so the GS is under the
grommet. Place a dot on the zero point of the grid scale (Figure 12.10).

12.10.2.3. Place the Zn (or grid Zn) of the body under the index. Position the slide so the cross or the
dot, whichever is uppermost, is on the zero line of the grid (Figure 12.11).

NOTE: The vertical distance between the zero line and the low mark is the combined 1-minute motion.
Each line of the grid equals 1 minute of arc (1 mile). If the cross is on the zero line, the motion is
positive. If the dot is on the zero line, the motion is negative. When solving for motions using grid, all
directions must be grid directions!

12.11. Combinations of Sun, Moon, and Venus. The moon or Venus are often visible during daylight
hours and can be used to obtain an LOP. Always consider fixing using these bodies during daylight
celestial flights. When planning the flight, use the sky diagrams in the Air Almanac to determine the
availability of the moon and Venus. If the bodies are available, they can be readily found by accurately
precomputing their altitudes and azimuths.

12.11.1. When looking for Venus, take all the filters out of the sextant and point it at the precise location
of the planet. A bright, small pinpoint of light will be visible but hard to detect, unless sky conditions
268                                                                AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

and separation from the sun are ideal. With practice, acquisition should become easier and you will be
familiar with those conditions conducive to successfully making a Venus shot.

12.11.2. During the day when the sun is high, the moon or Venus, if they are available, can be used to
obtain compass deviation checks. In polar regions during periods of continuous twilight, the moon and
Venus will be available if their declination (Dec) is the same name as the latitude.

12.12. Duration of Light. Sunrise and sunset at sea level and at altitude, moonrise and moonset and
semiduration graphs will not be discussed in detail in this chapter. It is imperative; however, to preplan
for any mission where twilight occurs during the course of the flight, especially at the higher latitudes
where twilight extends over longer periods of time. An excellent discussion, with appropriate examples,
is provided in the Air Almanac and should be sufficient for those missions requiring detailed planning.

Section 12Dâ€”True Heading Celestial Observation

12.13. Basics. The periscopic sextant, in addition to measuring celestial altitudes, can be used to
determine true headings (TH) and true bearings (TB). Any celestial body, whose azimuth can be
computed, can be used to obtain a TH. Except for Polaris, the appropriate volume of Pub. No. 249 is
entered to obtain Zn (true bearing). In the case of Polaris, the Air Almanac has an azimuth of Polaris
table. It does not require information from the Pub. No. 249 tables. The two methods used to obtain THs
with the periscopic sextant. The TB method requires precomputation of Zn. Postcomputation of Zn is
possible with the inverse relative bearing (IRB) method. The procedures are as follows:

12.14. True Bearing (TB) Method:

12.14.1. Determine GMT and body to be observed.

12.14.2. Extract GHA from the Air Almanac.

12.14.3. Apply exact longitude, at the time of the shot, to GHA to obtain exact LHA.

12.14.4. Enter appropriate Pub. No. 249. table with exact LHA, latitude, and Dec. Interpolate if
necessary and extract Zn and Hc (Figure 12.12). If Polaris is used, obtain the azimuth from the Azimuth
of Polaris table in the Air Almanac and use your latitude instead of Hc (Figure 12.13).

12.14.5. Set Zn in the azimuth counter window with the azimuth crank and set Hc in the altitude counter
window with the altitude control knob.

12.14.6. Collimate the body at the precomputed time and read the TH of the aircraft under the vertical
crosshair in the field of vision. If you are using precomputation techniques, a TH is available every time
an altitude observation is made.

NOTE: Shot must be taken at precomp time.

Section 12Eâ€”Celestial Navigation in High Latitudes

12.16. Basics. Celestial navigation in polar regions is of primary importance because (1) it constitutes a
primary method of determining position other than by DR and (2) it provides a reliable means of
establishing direction over much of the polar regions. The magnetic compass and directional gyro (DG)
are useful in polar regions, but they require an independent check, which can be provided by a celestial
body or other automatic systems such as INS or GPS.
272                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

12.16.1. At high latitudes, the sun's daily motion is nearly parallel to the horizon. The motion of the
aircraft in these regions can easily have greater effect upon altitude and Zn of the sun than the motion of
the sun itself.

12.16.2. At latitude 64o, an aircraft flying west at 400k keeps pace with the sun, which appears to remain
stationary in the sky. At higher latitudes, the altitude of a celestial body might be increasing at any time
of day, if the aircraft is flying toward it and a body might rise or set, at any azimuth, depending upon the
direction of motion of the aircraft relative to the body.

12.17. Bodies Available for Observation. During the continuous daylight of the polar summer, only the
sun is regularly available for observation. The moon is above the horizon about half the time, but
generally it is both visible and at a favorable position with respect to the sun for only a few days each
month.

12.17.1. During the long polar twilight, no celestial bodies may be available for observation. As in lower
latitudes, the first celestial bodies to appear after sunset and the last to remain visible before sunrise are
those brighter planets, which are above the horizon.

12.17.2. The sun, moon, and planets are never high in polar skies, thus making low altitude observations
routine. Particularly with the sun, observations are made when any part of the celestial body is visible. If
it is partly below the horizon, the upper limb is observed and a correction of -16' for semidiameter (SD)
is used in the SD block of the precomputation form.

12.17.3. During the polar night, stars are available. Polaris is not generally used because it is too near the
zenith in the arctic and not visible in the Antarctic. A number of good stars are in favorable positions for
observation. Because of large refractions near the horizon avoid low altitudes (below about 20o) when
higher bodies are visible.

12.18. Sight Reduction. Sight reduction in polar regions presents some slightly different problems from
those at lower latitudes. Remember, for latitudes greater than 69o N or 69o S, Pub. No. 249 tables have
tabulated Hcs and azimuths for only even degrees of LHA. This concerns you in two ways. First, it will
be necessary to adjust assumed longitude to achieve a whole, even LHA for extractions. This will
preclude interpolating. Second, the difference between successive, tabulated Hcs is for 2o of LHA, or 8
minutes of time, so this difference must be divided in half when computing motion of the body for 4
minutes of time.

12.18.1. For ease of plotting, all azimuths can be converted to grid. To convert, use the longitude of the
assumed position to determine convergence because the Zn is for the assumed position, not the DR
position. On polar charts, convergence is equal to longitude.

12.18.2. In computing motion of the observer, it is imperative that you use the difference between grid
azimuth and grid track, or Zn and true track, since this computation is based on relative bearing (RB).
Zn minus grid course does not give relative bearing.

12.18.3. Since low altitudes and low temperatures are normal in polar regions, refer to the refraction
correction table and use the temperature correction factor for all observations.

12.18.4. In polar regions, Coriolis corrections reach maximum values and should be carefully computed.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       273

12.19. Poles as Assumed Positions. Within approximately 2o of the pole, it is possible to use the pole as
the assumed position. With this method, no tabulated celestial computation is necessary and the position
may be determined by use of the Air Almanac alone.

12.19.1. At either of the poles of the earth, the zenith and the elevated poles are coincident or the plane
of the horizon is coincident with the plane of the equator. Vertical circles coincide with the meridians
and parallels of latitude coincide with Dec circles. Therefore, the altitude of the body is equal to its Dec
and the azimuth is equal to its hour angle.

12.19.2. To plot any LOP, an intercept and the azimuth of the body are needed. In this solution, the
elevated pole is the assumed position. The azimuth is plotted as the GHA of the body, or the longitude
of the subpoint. The intercept is found by comparing the Dec of the body, as taken from the Air
Almanac, with the observed altitude of the body. To summarize, the pole is the assumed position, the
Dec is the Hc, and the GHA equals the azimuth.

12.19.3. For ease of plotting, convert the GHA of the body to grid azimuth by adding or subtracting 180o
when using the North Pole as the assumed position. When at the South Pole, 360o â€“ GHA of the body
equals grid azimuth. The result will allow the use of the grid lines for plotting the LOPs. When using
grid azimuth for plotting, apply Coriolis to the assumed position (in this case, the pole). Precession or
nutation corrections are not necessary since current SHA and Dec are used. Motion of the observer
tables may also be used in precomputation, since grid azimuth relative to grid course may be
determined. Motion of the body is zero at the poles.

12.19.4. Note the exact GMT of the celestial observation. From the Air Almanac, extract the proper Dec
and GHA. Plot the azimuth. Compare Ho and Hc to obtain the intercept. When the observed altitude
(Ho) is greater than the Dec (Hc), it is necessary to go from the pole toward the celestial body along the
azimuth. If the observed altitude is less than the Dec, as is the case with the sun in Figure 12.15, it is
necessary to go from the pole away from the body along the azimuth. Draw the LOPs perpendicular to
the azimuth line in the usual manner. Don't be concerned about large intercepts; they have no bearing on
the accuracy of this type of fix. Observations on well-separated bearings give a fix that is as good close
to the pole as it is anywhere else.

Section 12Fâ€”Adjusting Assumed Position

12.20. Adjusting Assumed Position for Off-Time Shot. There will be times when the observer does
not start the shot at the prescribed time for various reasons. For example, the observer may struggle to
find the body due to cloud cover. If a shot is taken off time, you can use the FEAST (Fast EAST) rule: a
shot taken too fast or too early has the assumed position moved 15' of longitude east for each minute
early to compensate for body motion (see example in Figure 12.16). Apply the reverse of the FEAST
rule for late shots (move the assumed position west). This adjusted position is then advanced or retarded
for track and GS to account for motion of the observer, applying the same concept used in the
three-LHA method (Figure 12-5). This technique for solving motions is also discussed in Chapter 10.

 EXAMPLE: Original assumed position:                            23o-50' N 120o-00' W
          Move 15' of longitude west for 1 minute late
          Retard 6NM from track of 360o TH

Figure 12.16. Corrections for Off-Time Shooting.




12.21. Longitude Adjustment Principle. You will occasionally make errors in your precomputations.
Possibly the most common would be an extraction error of the GHA or math error while computing the
LHA. If one of these numbers is incorrect, then all the extractions from the Pub. No. 249 would be based
on erroneous information and the result would be an LOP error. Fortunately there is a way of
compensating for this type of error without having to reenter the table and retrieving the correct data.
This method is called the Longitude Adjustment Principle (LAP). You need only adjust the assumed
longitude (up to 2 1/2o) to correct for a GHA extraction error, or a math error. Moving the assumed
position beyond the 2 1/2o induces some error in the plotting LOP. Suppose you wanted the GHA for
1410Z (Figure 12.17), you extracted the value for 1400Z and applied it to the longitude. The resultant
LHA was used and the precomp completed before you realized your error. To do the LAP first, extract
the correct GHA (031-20), keep the old LHA, and adjust the longitude so that the math is correct (Figure
12.18). A math error can occur in solving for the LHA (Figure 12.19). Once you have corrected the
precomp, use the adjusted longitude for your assumed longitude to plot the LOP.

accurate as normal precomping procedures and save some time as well. These techniques are not all
inclusive. There are many commercial publications available as a source for celestial navigators: for

                           SEXTANTS AND ERRORS OF OBSERVATION

Section 13Aâ€”Sextants

13.1. Introduction. For hundreds of years, mariners have navigated the seas keeping track of their
positions by use of the sextant. This instrument measured the altitude of celestial bodies (angular
distance above the horizon) and the information derived from this measurement was used to determine
the position of the vessel. All celestial navigation follows this rule. Today's navigator measures the
altitude of the celestial bodies in much the same manner as Magellan or Columbus.

13.1.1. However, there is a difference between air and marine celestial navigation. Because marine
navigators are on the surface of the ocean, they can establish their horizon by referring to the natural
horizon. In an aircraft, this is impossible because altitude and aircraft attitude induce error. In the sextant
designed for air navigation, a bubble, like the one in a carpenter's level, determines an artificial horizon,
which is parallel to the celestial horizon. The bubble chamber is placed in the sextant so the bubble is
superimposed upon the field of view. Both the celestial body and the bubble are viewed simultaneously,
making it possible to keep the sextant level while sighting the body.

13.1.2. Sextants are subject to certain errors that must be compensated for when determining an LOP.
Some of these errors are instrument errors while others are induced by the various in-flight conditions.
The first half of this chapter discusses the sextant and the second half explains sextant errors.

13.2. The Bubble Sextant. The aircraft bubble sextant measures altitude above a horizontal plane
established by a bubble. Aviators use several types of bubble sextants, all of which are indirect sighting.
This means the navigator does not look directly toward the celestial body, but always looks in a
horizontal direction as shown in Figure 13.1. The image of the body is reflected into the field of view
when the field prism is set at the correct angle. In the bubble sextant, the bubble and body are visible in
the same field of view. The sextant system consists of four parts: the mount, the sextant, the electrical
cables and the carrying case.

13.3. The Mount. The mount, as shown in Figure 13.2, is fastened permanently to the top of the
fuselage of the aircraft. A shutter door is built into the mount to close the opening for the tube of the
periscopic sextant. This shutter door is controlled by the sextant port lever (1) on the mount. The mount
has a gimbal mechanism, which allows the sextant to be tilted from the vertical in any direction. This
permits a celestial body to be observed throughout the normal oscillations of an aircraft. A drain plug (2)
is provided at the low point in the shutter well for draining out water, which may have collected in the
mount.

NOTE: The numbers in parentheses in 13.3, 13.3.1, and 13.3.2 refer to the parts indicated in Figure
13.2.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      279

Figure 13.1. Body Is Not Sighted Directly.




13.3.1. The sextant is held in the mount by two locking pins (4), located in a movable collar on the
bottom of the mount. One pin locks the sextant into the mount and holds it in the retracted position; the
other pin locks the sextant in the extended position. These pins are spring-loaded and must be pulled out
to release the sextant. Located next to these locking pins is a friction clamping lever (3), which provides
the observer with the option of locking the sextant at a fixed azimuth or, when the tension is released,
the sextant may be rotated through 360o of azimuth. The azimuth scale (10) and azimuth counter (6) will
move when the azimuth crank (5) is rotated. The azimuth scale can be read against a lubber line or index
(11). The azimuth scale read against the lubber line and the azimuth counter reading should be the same.

13.3.2. Power is supplied from the aircraft through a cable connection (9) on the side of the mount. A
switch (8) on the side of the mount controls power to both the mount and the sextant. The mount has one
lamp that illuminates the azimuth counter window. Another cable (7) is connected to the socket on the
underside of the mount and supplies power to the sextant itself.

13.4. The Periscopic Sextant. The periscopic sextant is an optical instrument which enables the
navigator to determine true azimuth (Zn), relative bearing (RB), and altitude angle of a celestial body
and aircraft true heading (TH). The sextant provides an angle of observation from below the horizon to
directly overhead, as compared to an artificial horizon.

13.4.1. Proper collimation techniques and the correct size bubble are essential ingredients of accurate
celestial observations. Collimation is effected when the body is placed in the center of the bubble. For
greatest accuracy, the bubble should be in the center of the field, with the body in the center of the
bubble. The error will be small if the bubble is anywhere on the vertical line of the field, as long as it
does not touch the top or bottom of the bubble chamber. Figure 13.3 shows examples from better to
worse collimation.


Figure 13.3. Correct and Incorrect Collimation.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       281

13.4.2. Bubble size affects the accuracy of a sextant observation. The ideal situation for collimation is to
have a small bubble for ease in determining the center. A bubble that is too small will stick to the lens,
decreasing accuracy. A bubble that is too large will move like a creature from a science fiction movie,
making it difficult to find the center. Experience shows that best results are obtained with a bubble
approximately one and a half times the apparent diameter of the sun or moon, or about the size of a
Cheerio. The field prism is geared to an altitude scale so that when the body is collimated the altitude
can be read from the scale.

13.4.3. An averaging mechanism is also incorporated which allows the navigator to take an observation
over a period of time. The continuous motion of the aircraft affects the bubble and resultant artificial
horizon. This movement resolves itself into a cycle in which the aircraft rolls, yaws, and pitches. To
obtain an accurate reading, it is necessary to sight the body for a period of time during this cyclic
movement and to average the results of a series of sightings. An averaging device has been incorporated
in the sextant so an average reading can be obtained.

13.4.4. The sextant (Figure 13.4) is actually a low-power periscope with a 15o field of view. All lens
surfaces in the sextant are coated to minimize light loss. To prevent condensation when the tip of the
sextant is extended into cold air, the tube is filled with a dry gas and sealed. A desiccant (composed of
silica gel) is used to remove moisture and check on the dryness of the gas inside the tube, and is visible
in the periscopic end of the sextant, or in some models, on the sextant body. When the silica gel is pink,
there is moisture in the tube and the sextant should be replaced before flight.

NOTE: The numbers in parentheses in 13.4.5 through 13.4.11 refer to the parts indicated in Figure 13.4.


Figure 13.4. Periscopic Sextant.
282                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

13.4.5. An eyepiece (1) rotates to correct the eyesight of the individual observer. Filters (2) are provided
for selective use in the optical system so that the intensity of the sun's light might be adequately reduced.
The filter control (2) is located on the left of the sextant.

13.4.6. Most sextants currently in use have been modified with an electronic device for accomplishing
all the functions of the averaging mechanism. General differences in these and the unmodified sextants
are addressed in this discussion.

13.4.7. A start switch (4) (a start and stop or averager operating lever [4A] on unmodified sextants)
starts and stops the operation of the sextant. Adjacent to this switch is the reset switch (5) (the averager
rewind lever, if unmodified [5A] located below the averager operating lever). The reset switch or
averager rewind lever has four functions. When depressed and released, it does the following: (1)
removes the shutter from the field of vision, (2) zeroes and resets (rewinds if unmodified) the timer, (3)
zeroes the averager and places initial values in registers and data memory (realigns indices on
unmodified sextants), and (4) disconnects the altitude control knob from the averager.

13.4.8. The bubble control knob (6) should be left in the maximum increase position after adjustments
have been made. With the control in the maximum increase position, an aneroid is locked to the bubble
chamber to compensate for changes in ambient pressure and temperature.

13.4.9. On the front of the sextant, there is a rheostat control (7) which varies the intensity of the light in
the bubble chamber. The altitude knob (8) is located on the right side of the sextant. It keeps the
observed body in vertical collimation during the period of the observation. At the end of the scheduled
observation, it adjusts the altitude counter until the exact average indication appears, or to align the
indices on unmodified sextants. The body's altitude is read in the altitude counter (9). Directly behind
the altitude knob is the averager display (10) (half-time dial and indices if unmodified). The averager
display or half-time dial is graduated from 0-60 and indicates the half time of the observation. The
indices, when aligned, permit the direct reading of the observed altitude on the altitude dial.

13.4.10. In the periscope sextant, the averaging is accomplished by microprocessor (Deimel-Black ball
integrator if unmodified), which effects a continuous moving averager over any observation period up to
2 minutes. This system has many advantages over other known averaging devices: it is very simple to
operate. A single switch (or lever) sets or winds the mechanism and no other presetting of the sextant,
timing mechanism, or averaging is necessary. It is continuously integrating altitude against elapsed time.
After at least 30 seconds, it may be stopped at any time up to 2 minutes. The average altitude is read
directly from the counter. A half-time clock will indicate the half time of the observation. The time
indication may be added directly to the time of starting the observation to compute the mean time of the
observation. At the end of the observation, the averager energizes a solenoid (actuates a lever if
unmodified) which drops a shutter across the field of view, indicating the end of the observation.
Although it is possible to utilize an instantaneous shot, the normal timed observation lasts for 2 minutes.
It is impossible to time any observation for less than 30 seconds using the sextant timer.

13.4.11. A heading scale shutter (diffuser lever) control (11) provides a convenient means of blocking
out the bright illumination on the azimuth scale for night celestial observations. The objective lens (12)
is located just above the heading scale shutter control. The lens aligns the azimuth scale of the sextant
with the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. The lens can be rotated with the fingers in order to calibrate the
azimuth scale on a known bearing while looking through the eyepiece. The objectives lens can remove
up to 2o azimuth error in the azimuth ring. A locking ring beneath the lens prevents accidental
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                         283

movement. A dial lamp located on the right side of the sextant provides three beams of light to
illuminate the averager indicators, the altitude counter, and the watch clip. The watch clip is made to
hold an old-fashioned pocket watch.

13.5. Electrical Cables. Cables provide power for sextant operation and illumination. One "Y" cable
provides power from the mount to the sextant for illumination and averager operation.

13.6. Sextant Case. The case provides shock-absorbent storage for the sextant when it is not in use. The
sextant fits into formfitting foam blocks and is secured by straps. The case also contains spare bulbs for
sextant illumination and provides storage for the electrical cable.

Section 13Bâ€”Errors of Sextant Observation

13.7. Basics. If collimation of the body with the bubble and reading the sextant were all that had to be
done, celestial navigation would be simple. This would mean LOPs that are accurate to within 1 or 2
miles could be obtained without any further effort. Unfortunately, considerable errors are encountered in
every sextant observation made from an aircraft. A thorough understanding of the cause and magnitude
of these errors, as well as the proper application of corrections to either Hc or Hs, will help minimize
their effects. Remember that any correction applied to the Hs may be applied to the Hc with a reverse
sign. Accuracy of celestial navigation depends upon thorough application of these corrections together
with proper shooting techniques. The errors of sextant observation may be classified into four groups:
(1) parallax, (2) refraction, (3) acceleration, and (4) instrument.

13.8. Parallax Error. Parallax in altitude is the difference between the altitude of a body above a bubble
horizon at the surface of the earth and its calculated altitude above the celestial horizon at the center of
the earth. All Hcs are given for the center of the earth. If the light rays reaching the earth from a celestial
body are parallel, the body has the same altitude at both the center and the surface of the earth. For most
celestial bodies, parallax is negligible for purposes of navigation.

13.8.1. Parallax Correction for the Moon. The moon is so close to the earth that its light rays are not
parallel. The parallax of the moon may be as great as 1o; thus, when observing the moon, a parallax
correction must be applied to the Hs. This correction is always positive (+) and varies with the altitude
and with the distance of the moon from the earth. The correction varies from day to day because the
distance of the moon from the earth varies. Corrections for the moon's parallax in altitude are given on
the daily pages of the Air Almanac and are always added, algebraically, to sextant altitudes. The values
of parallax for negative altitudes are obtained from the Air Almanac for the equivalent positive altitudes.

13.8.2. Semidiameter Correction. This correction is found on the daily pages of the Air Almanac.
Apply it when shooting the upper or lower limb of the moon or the sun.

13.8.2.1. It is more likely to occur on observations of the moon because, when the moon is not full
(completely round), the center is difficult to estimate. Shoot either the upper or lower limb and apply the
semidiameter correction listed on the Air Almanac page for the time and date of the observation.
Subtract the correction from the Hs when shooting the upper limb; add the correction to the Hs when
shooting the lower limb. Reverse the sign if applying the correction to the Hc.

13.8.2.2. Listed on the same page is the semidiameter correction for the sun, which is applied the same
way as for the moon.
284                                                                    AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

EXAMPLE: Using Figure 13.5 extract the corrections for the upper limb of the moon as observed on 11
August 1995 at 1100Z is 33o41'. Apply these corrections as:

       Hs                               33o41'
       Parallax                           +49'
       Semidiameter                       -16'
       Ho                               34o14'

13.9. Atmospheric Refraction Error. Still another factor to be taken into consideration is atmospheric
refraction. If a fishing pole is partly submerged under water, it appears to bend at the surface. The
bending of light rays as they pass from the water into the air causes this appearance. This bending of the
light rays, as they pass from one medium into another, is called refraction. The refraction of light from a
celestial body as it passes through the atmosphere causes an error in sextant observation.

13.9.1. As the light of a celestial body passes from the almost perfect vacuum of outer space into the
atmosphere, it is refracted as shown in Figure 13.6 so that the body appears a little higher above the
horizon than it really is. Therefore, the correction to the Hs for refraction is always negative. The higher
the body above the horizon, the smaller the amount of refraction and, consequently, the smaller the
refraction correction. Moreover, the greater the altitude of the aircraft, the less dense the layer of
atmosphere between the body and the observer; hence, the less the refraction.

13.9.2. The appropriate correction table for atmospheric refraction is listed inside the back cover of all
four books used for celestial computations; namely, the Air Almanac and each of the three volumes of
Pub. No. 249. This table, shown in Figure 13.7, lists the refraction for different observed altitudes of the
body and for different heights of the observer above sea level. The values shown are subtracted from Hs
or added to Hc.

13.10. Acceleration Error. Presently, the only practical and continuously available reference datum for
the definition of the true vertical is the direction of the gravitational field of the earth. Definition of this
vertical establishes the artificial horizon. It is also fundamental that the forces caused by gravity cannot
be separated by those caused by accelerations within the sextant. A level or centered bubble in the
sextant indicates the true vertical only when the instrument is at rest or moving at a constant velocity in
a straight line. Any outside force (changes in GS or changes in track) will affect the liquid in the bubble
chamber and, consequently, displace the bubble.

13.10.1. When the sextant is moved in a curved path (Coriolis, changes in heading, rhumb line) or with
varying speed, the zenith indicated by the bubble is displaced from the true vertical. This presents a false
artificial horizon above which the altitude of the celestial body is measured. Since the horizon used is
false, the altitude measured from it is erroneous. Therefore, the accuracy of celestial observations is
directly related to changes in track and speed of the aircraft. Acceleration errors have two principal
causes: changes in GS and curvature of the aircraft's path in space.

13.10.2. The displacement of the liquid and the bubble in the chamber may be divided into two vectors
and each vector may be considered separately. These vectors may be thought of as a lateral vector (along
the wings) and a longitudinal vector (along the nose-tail axis of the aircraft). Any change in GS can
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                        287

cause a longitudinal displacement. This change can be brought about by a change in the airspeed or the
wind encountered, or the change in GS brought about by a change in heading due to other factors (gyro
precession, rhumb line error, etc.). A lateral displacement results from a number of causes, most of
which will occur in spite of any efforts to hold them in check. These causes are Coriolis, rhumb line, and
wander errors.

13.11. Coriolis Force. Any free-moving body traveling at a constant speed above the earth is subject to
an apparent force that deflects its path to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the
Southern Hemisphere. This apparent force and the resulting acceleration were first discovered shortly
before the middle of the 19th century by Gaspard Gustave de Coriolis (1792-1843) and given
quantitative formulation by William Ferrel (1817-1891). The acceleration is known as Coriolis
acceleration (or force) or simply Coriolis and is expressed in Ferrel's law.

13.11.1. You must realize that the bubble sextant indicates the true vertical only when the instrument is
at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line as perceived in space. If the earth were motionless,
this straight path in space would also be a straight path over the surface of the earth; conversely, a
straight path over the motionless earth would also be a straight path in space.

13.11.2. When the aircraft is flying a path curved in space to the left, the fluid in the bubble chamber is
deflected to the right and the bubble is deflected to the left of the aircraft's path over the earth. When the
aircraft is flying a curved path in space to the right, the reverse is true.

13.11.3. In Figure 13.8, the aircraft is represented as flying on a curved path to the left. Note that in the
inset representing the bubble chamber, the heavy black bubble is indicated in its approximate position
representing the true vertical.


Figure 13.8. Error Caused by Coriolis Force.
288                                                                   AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

13.11.4. The observer always seeks to center the bubble and, on this beam shot facing to the right side of
the aircraft to observe the body, tip the sextant up. This would tilt the bubble horizon from its true
position, producing a smaller sextant reading than the true value. The smaller the height observed (Ho),
the greater the radius of the circle of equal altitudeâ€”the LOP will fall farther from the subpoint than the
true LOP. Obviously, if the erroneous LOP falls farther from the subpoint, it will fall to the left of the
true LOP and the correction to the right is valid. Corrections for Coriolis error are shown on the inside
back cover of the Air Almanac as well as in all volumes of Pub. No. 249.

13.11.5. Coriolis acceleration is directly proportional to the straight-line velocity, directly proportional
to the angular velocity of the earth, directly proportional to the sine of the latitude, and at right angles to
the direction of flight.

13.12. Rhumb Line Error. The straight Coriolis table (Figure 13.9) found in the Air Almanac or Pub.
No. 249 has a limited application. As long as a constant TH is flown, the path of the aircraft will be a
rhumb line. Because a rhumb line on the earth's surface is a curve, it is also a curved line in space. If the
aircraft is headed in a general easterly direction in the Northern Hemisphere, the apparent curve is to the
left and becomes an addition to the Coriolis error. By the same token, if headed in a westerly direction in
the Northern Hemisphere, the apparent curve is to the right, or opposite that of Coriolis force as shown
in Figure 13.10.

13.12.1. There are notable exceptions to this. When flying north or south, the aircraft is flying a great
circle and there is no rhumb line error. Also, when steering by a free running, compensated gyro, the
track approximates a great circle and eliminates rhumb line error.


Figure 13.9. Coriolis Correction.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                 289

Figure 13.10. Coriolis and/or Rhumb Line Errors in the Northern Hemisphere.




13.12.2. At speeds under 300 knots, the error is negligible. However, at high speeds or high latitudes,
rhumb line error is appreciable. For example, at 60o N latitude with a track of 100o and a GS of 650
knots, the Coriolis correction is 15 NM right and the rhumb line correction is 10 NM right. Use the
following steps and Figure 13.11 to determine the correction for rhumb line error and Coriolis
correction:

13.12.2.1. Enter the nearest latitude on the left side. Interpolate if necessary.

13.12.2.2. Enter the nearest track across the top of the chart. Interpolate if necessary.

13.12.2.3. Choose the closest GS and extract the correction; that is, 50N, track 080o, GS 500 knots =
14.3 Right.

13.13. Groundspeed Acceleration Error. Changes in airspeed or wind velocity cause this error.
Prevent changes of airspeed through good crew coordination.
290                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 13.11. Combined Coriolis and Rhumb Line Correction.




13.13.1. Changes in wind velocity with resultant changes in GS are more difficult to control. The change
in GS will cause the liquid to be displaced, with the subsequent shifting of the bubble creating a false
horizon. Notice in Figure 13.12 how the horizon is automatically displaced by keeping the bubble in the
center while these changes are taking place. A very simple rule applies to acceleration and deceleration
forces. If the aircraft accelerates while a celestial observation is in progress, the resultant LOP will fall
ahead of the actual position. Accelerateâ€”Ahead. The more the LOP approaches a speed line, the greater
the acceleration error will become. Refer to Figure 13.13:

13.13.1.1. Enter with Zn-Track.

13.13.1.2. Extract acceleration error and apply sign.

13.13.2. Example: Track = 080o, Zn = 060o, Beginning GS â€“ 500 knots, ending GS â€“ 515 knots.

      060o â€“ 080o = 340o = -1.40
      515 â€“ 500 = 15 knots
      -1.40 x 15 = -21 correction to the Ho.

13.14. Wander Error. A change in track can be produced by changes in the wind, heading changes
caused by the autopilot or changing magnetic variation, or by heading changes caused by pilot manual
steering errors. As with the Coriolis force and rhumb line errors, correction tables have been developed
for wander error. Values extracted from the wander correction table, shown in Figure 13.14, are to be
applied to the Ho. Use the following information as entering arguments for the determination of the
correction taken from the table: (1) the heading at the beginning of the observation was 079o, (2) the
heading at the end of the observation was 081o, (3) the observation was taken over a 2-minute period, (4)
the GS was 450 knots, and (5) the Zn of the body was 130o.

AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        293

13.14.1. Following the instructions shown at the bottom of the table, enter the numerical portion of the
table with the values of GS and the change of track per 2 minutes. In this case, the GS is 450 knots and
the change in track per 2 minutes is 2o. Since the heading at the end of the observation is greater than the
heading at the beginning, the change is 2o to the right. Notice that you must know whether the change is
to the right or to the left to determine the sign of the correction. The factor obtained from the table is 12
x 2 = 24.

13.14.2. Next, enter the graph portion of the table with the value of the factor (24) and the value of the
azimuth of the body minus the value of track. The graph is so constructed that it must be entered with Zn
- Tr. Zn - Tr = 130o â€“ 080o; so use 050o. Following the rules in steps two and three in the table; the
correction is 19'. Since the change in track is to the right, the correction is subtracted from the Ho. This
is determined by referring to the signs shown at the ends of the arc in the table. Figure 13.15 shows the
effect of this correction.

13.14.3. If the track and groundspeed are the same at the beginning and the end of a shooting period,
there will be no wander error.


Figure 13.15. Wander Correction Applied to Ho.




13.15. Instrument Error. Index error is usually the largest mechanical error in the sextant. This error is
caused by improper alignment of the index prism with the altitude counter. No matter how carefully a
sextant is handled, it is likely to have some index error. If the error is small, the sextant need not be
readjusted; rather, each Hs can be corrected by the amount of the error. This means that the index error
of the sextant must be known to obtain an accurate celestial LOP. Another mechanical error found in
sextants is backlash. This is caused by excessive play in the gear train connecting the index prism to the
altitude counter.
294                                                                AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

13.15.1. Usually, index and backlash errors are nearly constant through the altitude range of the sextant.
Therefore, if the error at one altitude setting is determined, the correction can be applied to any Hs or
Hc. The correction is of equal value to the error but the opposite sign.

13.15.2. The sextant should be checked on the ground before every celestial flight. Preflighting the
sextant can determine the sextant error of an individual instrument. The sextant error can also be
determined in-flight and a correction can be applied to the precomp to compensate for the error. To
determine the error and correction in-flight, one must have a celestial LOP, a Zn and the actual (or best-
known) position of the aircraft at the same time. Refer to Figure 13.16.


Figure 13.16. Determining Sextant Error Correction.




13.15.3. The fix symbol represents the best-known position at the time of the celestial LOP. To
determine the actual value of the correction, measure the shortest distance between the position and the
LOP. This tells you how many minutes of arc (NM) the Ho must be adjusted on subsequent shots to get
an accurate LOP (in this case, the value is 10'). To determine whether this value must be added or
subtracted, note whether the LOP needs to be adjusted toward the Zn or away from the Zn. Remember
the rule HOMOTO? It applies here, too. If the LOP needs to be moved toward the Zn in order to be
made more accurate, the Ho needs to be made larger, thus the correction is added to the Ho to make the
Ho value increase. If the LOP needs to be moved away from the Zn, the correction will be subtracted
from the Ho to make the Ho less. In Figure 13.16, the LOP needs to be moved 10 miles toward the Zn in
order to be accurate; thus, the sextant error correction is +10 to the Ho and can be used on subsequent
shots obtained from the same sextant.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     295

13.15.4. An important thing to remember is that the sextant error correction assumes conditions will be
consistent. As a technique, it is wise to obtain several LOPs with a sextant, noting the sextant errors on
each, before establishing a value to be carried on the precomp. Once using that correction, make sure
you use the same sextant.

13.16. Summary. The first half of this chapter described the parts and operation of the sextant, and the
second half explained sextant errors. Remember to apply parallax, semidiameter, and refraction errors
on every applicable shot. Corrections for acceleration errors can be applied only if you know the track
and groundspeed before and after each shot, so be aware of your speed and direction when shooting.
Time permitting, always try to evaluate the accuracy of your sextant on the ground.

                                          GRID NAVIGATION

Section 14Aâ€”Introduction

14.1. Basics. The original purpose of grid navigation was to ease the difficulties facing the navigator
during high latitude flights. But grid can be used at all latitudes; particularly on long routes because grid
uses a great circle course for a heading reference. Grid is simply a reorientation of the heading reference,
and does not alter standard fixing techniques.

Section 14Bâ€”Problems Encountered in Polar Navigation

14.2. Basics. Two factors peculiar to polar areas which make steering more difficult than usual are (1)
magnetic compass unreliability and (2) geographic meridians converging at acute angles. The combined
effect of these two factors makes steering by conventional methods difficult if not impossible. Each
factor is examined below.

14.3. Unreliability of Magnetic Compass. Maintaining an accurate heading in high latitudes is difficult
when a magnetic compass is used as the heading indicator. Built to align itself with the horizontal
component of the earth's magnetic field, the compass instead must react to the strong vertical
component, which predominates near the magnetic poles. Here, the horizontal component is too weak to
provide a reliable indication of direction. As a result, compass performance becomes sluggish and
inaccurate. The situation is further aggravated by the frequent magnetic storms in the polar regions,
which shift the magnetic lines of force.

14.3.1. But even if these conditions did not exist, the mere proximity to the magnetic pole would sharply
reduce compass usefulness. While the aircraft may fly a straight course, the compass indicator would
swing rapidly, faithfully pointing at a magnetic pole passing off to the left or right.

14.3.2. To cope with the unreliable magnetic compass, we use gyro information for our heading inputs.

14.4. Problem of Converging Meridians. The nature of the conventional geographic coordinate system
is such that all meridians converge to the pole. Each meridian represents a degree of longitude; each is
aligned with true north and true south. On polar charts, the navigator encounters 1 degree of change in
true course for each meridian crossed; thus, the more closely the aircraft approaches a pole, the more
rapidly it crosses meridians. Even in straight-and-level flight along a great circle course, true course can
change several degrees over a short period of time. You are placed in the peculiar position of constantly
altering the aircraft's magnetic heading in order to maintain a straight course. For precision navigation,
such a procedure is clearly out of the question. Notice in Figure 14.1 that the course changes 60o
between A and B and much nearer the pole, between C and D, it changes 120o. To cope with the
problem of converging meridians, we will use the USAF Grid Overlay.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      297

Figure 14.1. Converging Meridians.




14.5. Grid Chart Projections. The three polar projections most commonly used in polar areas for grid
navigation are the transverse Mercator, the polar stereographic and the polar gnomonic. The transverse
Mercator and polar stereographic projections are used in-flight, the polar gnomonic is used only for
planning. The Lambert conformal projection is the one most commonly used for grid flight in subpolar
areas. The division between polar and subpolar projections varies among the aeronautical chart series.
For example, the division is at 70o of latitude for the JN series at 80o of latitude for the Operational
Navigation Chart (ONC) series charts.

Section 14Câ€”USAF Grid Overlay

14.6. Basics. The graticule of the USAF Grid Overlay eliminates the problem of converging meridians
(Figure 14.2). It is a square grid and, though its meridians are aligned with grid north (GN) along the
Greenwich meridian, they do not converge at GN. While the USAF Grid Overlay can be superimposed
on any projection, it is most commonly used with the polar stereographic (for flights in polar areas) and
the Lambert conformal (for flights in subpolar areas). This is because a straight line on these projections
approximates a great circle. As the great circle course crosses the true meridians, its true direction
changes but its grid direction remains constant (Figures 14.3 and 14.4). All grid meridians are parallel to
the Greenwich meridian and TN along the Greenwich meridian is the direction of GN over the entire
chart.

14.7. Relationship of Grid North (GN) to True North (TN). Because grid meridians are parallel to the
Greenwich meridian, the aircraft longitude and the convergence factor (CF) of the chart govern the angle
between GN and TN.
298                                                 AFPAM11-216   1 MARCH 2001

Figure 14.4. Great Circle True Direction Is Constant.




14.7.1. CF of 1.0. Figure 14.5 shows that charts having CFs of 1.0 display GN to TN relationship as a
direct function of longitude. In the Northern Hemisphere at 30o W, GN is 30o W of TN; at 60o W, GN is
60o W of TN. Similarly, at 130o E longitude, GN is 130o E of TN. In the Southern Hemisphere, the
direction of GN with respect to TN is exactly opposite.

14.7.2. CF of Less than 1.0. Figure 14.6 shows a chart with a CF of less than 1.0 with a USAF Grid
Overlay superimposed on it. The relationship between GN and TN on this chart is determined in the
same manner as on charts with a CF of 1.0. On charts with a CF of less than 1.0, the value of the
convergence angle at a given longitude is always smaller than the value of longitude and is equal to the
CF times the aircraft longitude.

Figure 14.6. Grid Overlay Superimposed on Lambert Conformal (Convergence Factor 0.785).




14.8. Relationship of Grid Direction to True Direction. Use the following formulas to determine grid
direction.

      In the Northern Hemisphere:
      Grid direction = true direction + west longitude x convergence factor
      Grid direction = true direction â€“ east longitude x convergence factor

      In the Southern Hemisphere:
      Grid direction = true direction â€“ west longitude x convergence factor
      Grid direction = true direction + east longitude x convergence factor


14.9. Polar Angle. Polar angle is used to relate true direction to grid direction. Polar angle is measured
clockwise through 360o from GN to TN. It is simple to convert from one directional reference to the
other by use of the formula grid direction = true direction + polar angle. To determine polar angle from
convergence angle (CA), apply the following formulas.

      In the Northwest and Southeast Quadrants, Polar angle = convergence angle
      In the Northeast and Southwest Quadrants, Polar angle = 360o â€“ convergence angle

14.10. Chart Transition. Since the relationship of the true meridians and the grid overlay on subpolar
charts differs from that on polar charts because of different CFs, the overlays do not match when a
transition is made from one chart to the other. Therefore, the grid course (GC) of a route on a subpolar
chart will be different than the GC of the same route on a polar chart. The chart transition problem is
best solved during flight planning:

14.10.1. Select a transition point common to both charts.

14.10.2. Measure the subpolar GC and the polar GC.
AFPAM11-216         1 MARCH 2001                                                                    301

14.10.3. Compute the difference between the GCs obtained in 14.10.2. This is the amount the compass
pointer must be changed at the transition point. NOTE: If the GC on the first chart is smaller than the
GC on the second chart, add the GC difference to the directional gyro (DG) reading and reposition the
DG pointer; if the GC on the first chart is larger, subtract the GC difference.

   EXAMPLE: Chart transition from a subpolar to a polar chart. GC on subpolar chart is 316o. GC on
   polar chart is 308o. GC difference is 8o. Gyro reading (grid heading [GH]) is 320o. The transition is
   from a larger GC to a smaller GC; therefore, the GC difference (8o) is subtracted from the GH value
   read from the DG (320o). The DG pointer is then repositioned to the new GH (312o).

                  Computed:                                        Applied:

    From (subpolar) GC          316o                   Old (subpolar) GH              320o
    GC difference                â€“8o                   GC difference                   â€“8 o
    To (polar) GC               308o                   New (polar) GH                 312o

CAUTION: Do not alter the aircraft heading; instead, simply reposition the DG pointer to the new GH.

14.11. Crossing 180th Meridian on Subpolar Chart. When a flight crosses the 180th meridian on a
subpolar grid chart, the GH changes because of the convergence of grid meridians along this true
meridian. This is very similar to the chart transition procedure described above. When using a subpolar
chart that crosses the 180th meridian on an easterly heading (A to B in Figure 14.7), the apical angle
must be subtracted from the GH. Conversely, the apical angle must be added to the GH when on a
westerly heading (B to A in Figure 14.7). The apical angle can be measured on the chart at the 180th
meridian between the converging GN references. The angle can also usually be found on the chart
border, or computed by use of the following formula:

   Apical angle = 360o â€“ (360o x convergence factor)

   EXAMPLE:

   Given:         Chart convergence factor 0.785
   Find:          Apical angle
                  Apical angle = 360o â€“ (360o x 0.785)
                  Apical angle = 360o â€“ 283o
                  Apical angle = 77o

CAUTION: Do not alter the aircraft heading when crossing the l80th meridian; instead, simply reset the
DG pointer to the new GH.

Figure 14.7. Crossing 180th Meridian on Subpolar Chart.




14.12. Grivation. The difference between the directions of the magnetic lines of force and GN is called
grivation (GV). GV is similar to variation and used to convert MH to GH and vice versa. Figure 14.8
shows the relationship between GN, TN, and MN. Lines of equal GV (isogrivs) are plotted on grid
charts.

Figure 14.8. Grivation.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      303

14.12.1. The formulas for computing GV in the Northern Hemisphere are:

   GV = (â€“W conv angle) + W variation
   GV = (â€“W conv angle) â€“ E variation

   GV = (+E conv angle) + W variation
   GV = (+E conv angle) â€“ E variation

14.12.2. If GV is positive, it is W grivation; if grivation is negative, it is E grivation. For example, if
variation is 17o E and convergence angle is 76o W, using the formula:

   GV = (â€“West conv angle) + (â€“East variation)
   GV = (â€“76) + (â€“l7) = â€“93
   GV = 93o East

14.12.3. To compute MH from GH, use the formula:

   MH = GH +W grivation
   MH = GH â€“ E grivation

14.12.4. In the Southern Hemisphere, reverse the signs of west and east convergence angles in the
formula above.

Section 14Dâ€”Gyro Precession

14.13. Basics. To eliminate the difficulties imposed by magnetic compass unreliability in polar areas,
you disregard the magnetic compass in favor of a free-running gyro. Gyro steering is used because it is
stable and independent of magnetic influence. When used as a steering instrument, the gyro is restricted
so its spin axis always remains horizontal to the surface of the earth and is free to turn only in this
horizontal plane. Any movement of a gyro spin axis from its initial horizontal alignment is called
precession. The two types of precession are real and apparent, with apparent broken into earth rate,
transport, and grid transport precession. Total precession is the cumulative effect of real and apparent
precession.

14.14. Real Precession. Real precession, illustrated in Figure 14.9, is the actual movement of a gyro
spin axis from its initial alignment in space. It is caused by such imperfections as power fluctuation,
imbalance of the gyro, friction in gyro gimbal bearings, and acceleration forces. As a result of the
improved quality of equipment now being used, real precession is considered to be negligible. Some
compass systems have a real precession rate of less than 1o per hour. Electrical or mechanical forces are
intentionally applied by erection or compensation devices to align the gyro spin axis in relation to the
earth's surface. In this manner, the effects of apparent precession are eliminated and the gyro can then be
used as a reliable reference.
304                                                                 AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 14.9. Real Precession.




14.15. Apparent Precession. The spin axis of a gyro remains aligned with a fixed point in space, while
your plane of reference changes, making it appear that the spin axis has moved. Apparent precession is
this apparent movement of the gyro spin axis from its initial alignment.

14.15.1. Earth Rate Precession. Earth rate precession is caused by the rotation of the earth while the
spin axis of the gyro remains aligned with a fixed point in space. Earth rate precession is divided into
two components. The tendency of the spin axis to tilt up or down from the horizontal plane of the
observer is called the vertical component. The tendency of the spin axis to drift around laterally; that is,
to change in azimuth, is called the horizontal component. Generally, when earth rate is mentioned, it is
the horizontal component which is referred to, since the vertical component is of little concern.

14.15.2. Figure 14.10. A gyro located at the North Pole, with its spin axis initially aligned with a
meridian, appears to turn 15.04o per hour in the horizontal plane because the earth turns 15.04o per hour.
As shown in A of Figure 14.10, the apparent relationship between the Greenwich meridian and the gyro
spin axis will change by 90o in 6 hours, though the spin axis is still oriented to the same point in space.
Thus, apparent precession at the pole equals the rate of earth rotation. At the equator, as shown in B of
Figure 14.10, no earth rate precession occurs in the horizontal plane if the gyro spin axis is still aligned
with a meridian and is parallel to the earth's spin axis.

14.15.3. Vertical Component. When the gyro spin axis is turned perpendicular to the meridian (Figure
14.11), maximum earth rate precession occurs in the vertical component. But the directional gyro does
not precess vertically because of the internal restriction of the gyro movement in any but the horizontal
plane. Thus, for practical purposes, earth rate precession is only that precession which occurs in the
horizontal plane. Figure 14.11 illustrates earth rate precession at the equator for 6 hours of time.

14.15.4. Precession Variation. Earth rate precession varies between 15.04o/hr at the poles and 0o/hr at
the equator. It is computed for any latitude by multiplying 15.04o times the sine of the latitude. For
example, at 30o N, the sine of latitude is 0.5. The horizontal component of earth rate is, therefore,
15o/hour right x 0.5 or 7.5o/hour right at 30o N as shown in Figure 14.12.
AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001                                         305

Figure 14.12. Earth Precession Varies According to Latitude.




14.15.5. Steering by Gyro. Obviously, if the gyro is precessing relative to the steering datum of GN or
TN, an aircraft steered by the gyro will be led off heading at the same rate. To compensate for this
precession, an artificial real precession is induced in the gyro to counteract the earth rate. At 30o N
latitude, earth rate precession is equal to 15o X sin lat = 15 X .5 or 7.5o per hour to the right.

14.15.6. Offsetting Each Rate Effect. Hence, if at 30o N latitude, a real precession of 7.5o left per hour
is induced in the gyro, it will exactly balance and offset earth rate effect. In ordinary gyros, a weight is
used to produce this effect but, since the rate is fixed for a given latitude, the correction is good for only
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       307

one latitude. The latitude chosen is normally the mean latitude of the area in which the aircraft will
operate. The N-1 and AHRS compass systems have a latitude setting knob, which you can use to adjust
for the earth rate corrections.

14.16. Earth Transport Precession (Horizontal Plane). This form of apparent precession results from
transporting a gyro from one point on the earth's surface to another. The gyro spin axis appears to move
because the aircraft, flying over the curved surface of the earth, changes its attitude in relation to the
gyro's fixed point in space (Figure 14.13). Earth transport precession causes the gyro spin axis to move
approximately 1o in the horizontal plane for each true meridian crossed. This effect is avoided by using
GN as the steering reference.


Figure 14.13. Earth Transport Precession.




14.17. Grid Transport Precession. Grid transport precession exists because meridian convergence is
not precisely portrayed on charts. The navigator wants to maintain a straight-line track, but the gyro
follows a great-circle track, which is a curved line on a chart. The rate at which the great-circle track
curves away from a straight-line track is grid transport precession. This is proportional to the difference
between convergence of the meridians as they appear on the earth and as they appear on the chart and
the rate at which the aircraft crosses these meridians.

14.18. Summary of Precession. Real precession is caused by friction in the gyro gimbal bearings and
dynamic unbalance. It is an unpredictable quantity and can be measured only by means of heading
checks.

14.18.1. Earth rate precession is caused by the rotation of the earth. It can be computed in degrees per
hour with the formula: 15.04 x sin lat. It is to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the
308                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Southern Hemisphere. All gyros are corrected to some degree for this precession, many by means of a
latitude setting knob.

14.18.2. Earth transport precession (horizontal plane) is an effect caused by using TN as a steering
reference. It can be computed by using the formula (change longitude/hr x sine mid latitude). The
direction of the precession is a function of the TC of the aircraft. If the course is 0o â€“ 180o, precession is
to the right; if the course is 180o â€“ 360o, precession is to the left. This precession effect is avoided by
using GN as a steering reference.

14.18.3. Grid transport precession is caused by the fact that the great circles are not portrayed as straight
lines on plotting charts. The navigator tries to fly the straight pencil-line course, the gyro a great circle
course. The formula for grid transport precession is change longitude/hr (sin lat-CF), where CF is the
chart convergence factor. The direction of this precession is a function of the chart used the latitude and
the TC. Direct substitution into the formula will produce an answer valid for easterly courses, such as,
0oâ€“180o. For westerly courses, the sign of the answer must be reversed.

14.19. Gyro Steering. Gyro steering is much the same as magnetic steering, except that grid heading
(GH) is used in place of true heading (TH). GH has the same relation to grid course (GC) as TH has to
true course (TC). The primary steering gyro in most aircraft provides directional data to the autopilot
and maintains the aircraft on a preset heading. When the aircraft alters heading, it turns about the
primary gyro while the gyro spin axis remains fixed in azimuth. If the primary gyro precesses, it causes
the aircraft to change its heading by an amount equal to the precession.

Section 14Eâ€”Starting a Grid Navigation Leg

14.20. Basics. Grid navigation is normally entered while airborne on a constant heading. A constant
heading is necessary because grid entry is accomplished by resetting the compass from a magnetic to a
grid reference while on the same heading. After obtaining a grid celestial or INS heading check, reset
the compass immediately to the correct grid heading to avoid heading errors (because the precomputed
grid Zn is only good for shot time). Since the exact grid heading is set at the beginning of the navigation
leg, precession is assumed to be zero until subsequent heading checks assess the accuracy of the gyro.
The grid heading is normally obtained using a variant of the true heading method or the INS TH. Using
this method, set a grid Zn in the sextant azimuth counter before collimating on the body. Other heading
shot methods can be used, but would delay resetting the gyro to accomplish math computations after the
heading shot. Although any celestial body may be used, navigators commonly use the sun or Polaris,
depending on the time of day (Figure 14.14.)

14.21. Using a Zn Graph. In order to get an accurate grid Zn for daytime grid entry, the navigator must
compute Zn of the sun for a time and geographic position where the grid navigation leg will begin. If the
geographic position for grid entry is known well in advance, you can prepare a Zn graph for a time
window. A Zn graph makes grid entry easier because it is usable for an extended period of time,
therefore eliminating the need to precomp for a specific time. The graph can be constructed during
mission planning, thus reducing workload in the air.

14.21.1. To construct the graph, precomp and plot Zn on one axis and time on the other (Figure 14.15).
Set up the time axis to cover the planned start time and several minutes earlier and later. Plot grid Zn on
the other axis using normal precomp procedures and the start point coordinates. Because the time/Zn
slope is close to linear, precomping at 20-30 minute intervals and connecting the points will give
acceptable accuracy. When the sun is near local noon, precomp Zn at closer intervals because the Zn
changes rapidly. To use the graph when it is finished, enter on the time axis. Then extend a line
perpendicular to the time axis until reaching the time/Zn line. Finally, read the appropriate Zn on the Zn
axis.

14.21.2. The sample in Figure 14.15 demonstrates using a graph to get a grid Zn for the time of 1700Z.
Although preparing a Zn graph takes a while, it pays dividends as long as you actually fly over the
planned geographic point within the time frame covered by the graph.

14.22. Applying Precession to the DR. The most accurate method for applying precession to the DR is
the "all behind/half ahead method." This method corrects for the "banana" effect most commonly
associated with precession. Since the full effect of precession does not occur at one time, we have to
account for the gradual increase of precession.

14.22.1. Step 1 â€” Determine the Hourly Rate. In Figure 14.16, grid entry occurred at 1700. At 1720,
the navigator obtained a heading shot or MPP. The heading shot determined precession correction to be
-2 and the compass was reset to the GH. On the MB-4 computer place the -2 correction on the outside
scale and the time since grid entry (20 minutes) on the inside scale. The hourly rate now appears above
the index (6.0R). To minimize error the hourly rate has to be computed to the nearest tenth of a degree.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                       311

Figure 14.16. Typical Mission In-Flight Log.




14.22.2. Step 2 â€” Compute "All Behind/Half Ahead." Since precession begins at the last time the
gyro was reset, for this example we need to start at grid entry 1700. At 1700 "all behind" would be
determined to be zero minutes and half-ahead to the next DR (1706) would be 3 minutes. To determine
the amount of precession correction to be used, leave the hourly rate (6.0) over the index and look above
3 minutes. The computed precession correction for the 1706 DR is -0.3o or 0 for use on the log. Next we
need to determine the precession correction for the 1720 DR. At 1706, "all behind" is 6 minutes and
"half ahead" is 7 minutes. The total time used to compute the precession correction for this DR is 13
minutes. Again, using the hourly rate precession correction for the 1720 DR is -1.3o or -1o for the log.

14.23. KC-135 Method. Since the "all behind/half ahead" method tends to keep you behind, the KC-
135 method is used by some navigators to predict precession. This method basically uses half of the
computed precession correction for future DRs/MPPs when the precession correction is determined
between two positions. Though not as accurate as the "all behind/half ahead" method, the KC-135
method can be effective if used with short DRs. Using the KC-135 method, compensate for precession
around the turn by getting a heading shot immediately before and after the turn, resetting the gyro after
the heading shot restarts precession.

14.24. False Latitude. A second method of compensating for precession while in-flight involves the use
of false latitude inputs into the gyro compass. Most gyro compasses have a latitude control, which
allows the navigator to compensate for earth rate precession (ERP). Normally, the latitude control is set
to the actual latitude of the aircraft. However, other values may be set. For example, if the aircraft is at
30o N and the latitude control knob is set to 70o N, the gyro will overcorrect for ERP. Since ERP is right
in the Northern Hemisphere, the correction will be to the left. Thus, setting a higher than actual latitude
will correct for right precession over and above that for ERP. Since ERP 15o/hr X sine latitude, a table
such as Figure 14.17 can be developed to use this procedure.
312                                                               AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

14.25. Summary. The USAF Grid Overlay and the free-running gyro are used to overcome the
difficulties of converging meridians and the unreliability of the magnetic compass when navigating in
high latitudes. When using gyro steering, maintain a record of the precession of both the primary and
secondary gyros. The gyro log provides you with the information necessary to predict values when it is
impossible to obtain heading checks because of overcast conditions or twilight. By maintaining a log on
the secondary gyro, the navigator can change gyros in case of malfunction of the primary gyro. Use the
information recorded in the gyro log in conjunction with the navigator's log to plot position and compute
winds, headings, alter headings, and ETAs. And never forget grid is green.

                                PRESSURE PATTERN NAVIGATION

Section 15Aâ€”Pressure Differential Techniques

15.1. Basics. Pressure differential flying is based on a mathematically derived formula. The formula
predicts windflow based on the fact that air moves from a high pressure system to a low pressure
system. This predicted windflow, the geostrophic wind, is the basis for pressure navigation. The formula
for the geostrophic wind (modified for a constant pressure surface) combined with in-flight information
makes available two aids to navigation: Bellamy drift and the pressure line of position (PLOP). Bellamy
drift gives information about aircraft track by supplying net drift over a set period of time. Using the
same basic information, the PLOP provides an LOP as valid as any other type.

15.2. Constant Pressure Surface. To understand pressure differential navigation, you should know
something about the constant pressure surface. The constant pressure surface is one on which the
pressure is the same everywhere, even though its height above sea level will vary from point to point as
shown in Figure 15.1. The pressure altimeter will show a constant reading. A constant pressure surface
is shown on a constant pressure chart (CPC) as lines that connect points of equal height above sea level.
These lines are referred to as contours (Figure 15.2) and are analogous to contour lines on land maps.
The intersection of altitude MSL and constant pressure surfaces form isobars. A comparison of isobars
and contours is shown in Figure 15.2. The geostrophic wind will blow along and parallel to the contours
of a CPC just as it blows along and parallel to the isobars of a constant level chart.

15.3. Geostrophic Wind. The shape and configuration of the constant pressure surface determine the
velocity and direction of the geostrophic wind. Flying with 29.92 set in the pressure altimeter will cause
the aircraft to follow a constant pressure surface and change its true height as the contours change
(Figure 15.3). The slope of the pressure surface, also known as the pressure gradient, is the difference in
pressure per unit of distance as shown in Figure 15.4. The pressure gradient force (PGF) or slope of the
pressure surface and Coriolis combine to produce the geostrophic wind. The speed of the geostrophic
wind is proportional to the spacing of the contours or isobars. Closely spaced contours form a steep
slope and produce a stronger wind, while widely spaced contours produce relatively weak winds.
According to Buys-Ballots Law, if you stand in the Northern Hemisphere with your back to the wind,
the lower pressure is to your left (Figure 15.5). The opposite is true in the Southern Hemisphere where
Coriolis deflection is to the left. Further study of Figure 15.5 shows that as you enter a low or a high
system, your drift will be right or left, respectively. The opposite is true as you exit the system. Since the
geostrophic wind is based on a constant pressure surface, you must fly a constant pressure altitude. A
minimum of 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the surface will usually eliminate distortion introduced through
surface friction. Near the equator (20o N to 20o S), Coriolis force approaches zero, and pressure
navigation is unreliable, pressure differential navigation is reliable in midlatitudes.

Figure 15.5. Buys-Ballots Law.




15.4. Pressure Computations and Plotting. In determining a PLOP or Bellamy drift by pressure
differential techniques, use the crosswind component of the geostrophic wind over a given period of
time. To determine your pressure pattern displacement (ZN), use the following equation:




This formula gives the direction and crosswind displacement effect of the pressure system you've flown
through. To solve for ZN, you must understand how to obtain and apply such special factors as D
readings, effective true airspeed (ETAS), effective airpath (EAP), effective air distance (EAD), and K
values.

15.5. D Readings. The symbol D stands for the difference between the true altitude (TA) of the aircraft
and the pressure altitude (PA) of the aircraft. There are two methods for obtaining D values. The first
uses an absolute altimeter to measure TA on overwater flights and the pressure altimeter to measure PA.
The second method uses outside air temperature (OAT) readings to determine equivalent D values if the
absolute altimeter fails. For both methods, the D value is expressed in feet as a plus or minus value. To
determine the correct D reading using the altimeter method, assign a plus (+) to TA, a minus (-) to PA,
and algebraically add the two. Remember the city in Florida (TAMPA) to keep the signs right. Take the
first D reading in conjunction with the initial fix for the pressure navigation leg. This is D1. Take the
second reading (D2) at the next fix. Always take the readings at the same time relative to the fix (usually
about 4 minutes before fix time). The value, D2 â€“ D1, is an expression of the slope or pressure gradient
experienced by the aircraft. Subtracting D1 from D2 determines the change in aircraft TA between
readings. When this altitude change is compared with the distance flown, the resulting value becomes an
expression of the slope. The value of D2 â€“ D1 indicates whether the aircraft has been flying upslope (+)
or downslope (-).
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      317

15.5.1. Take readings carefully, because an erroneous reading of either altimeter will produce an
incorrect D reading and a bad LOP. Gently tap the pressure altimeter before reading it to reduce
hysteresis error.

15.5.2. Maintain a constant PA to ensure consistent D readings. If you change altitudes, start with a new
D at the new altitude, or correct the previous reading by use of a pastagram. The pastagram will allow
you to continue accurately even though you've changed altitude. The pastagram uses average altitude
and average temperature change to determine a correction to the D reading taken before the altitude
change. Figure 15.6 shows a pastagram with instructions for its use and a sample problem.

15.6. Effective True Airspeed (ETAS). To determine a PLOP, you must compute the ETAS from the
last D reading. The ETAS is the TAS that the aircraft flew from the last fix to the next fix air position
(Figure 15.7). If the aircraft has maintained a constant true heading (TH) between D readings, the ETAS
equals the average TAS. But, if the aircraft has altered heading substantially between the D readings, the
effective TAS is derived by drawing a straight line from the fix at the first D reading to the final air
position. This line is called the effective airpath (EAP). ETAS is computed by measuring the effective
air distance (EAD) and dividing it by the elapsed time. In Figure 15.7, an aircraft flew at 400 knots TAS
from the 0820 fix to the 1020 air position via a dogleg route. The EAD is 516 NM; consequently, the
ETAS is 258 knots.

15.7. K Factor. The constant K takes into account Coriolis and the gravity constant for particular
latitudes.




15.7.1. Midlatitude is the average latitude between D1 and D2. It is in tabular form in Figure 15.8. In the
table, this constant is plotted against latitude since Coriolis force varies with latitude. In using the ZN
formula, enter the table with midlatitude and extract the corresponding K factor.

Figure 15.7. Effective True Airspeed.




15.7.2. On MB-4 computers, a subscale of latitude appears opposite the values for K factors on the
minutes scale. K is computed so that with slope expressed in feet and distance in NM, the geostrophic
windspeed is in knots. For training purposes only, the K factors for 20o N or S to 14o N or S are listed in
Figure 15.9.

15.8. Crosswind Displacement. ZN is the displacement from the straight-line airpath between the
readings. Therefore, a PLOP must be drawn parallel to the effective airpath. With all the necessary
values available, the ZN formula can be rearranged for convenient solution on the DR computer as
follows:




Printed instructions on the face of MB-4 computers specify that to compute crosswind component, set
EAD on the minutes scale opposite D2 - D1 on the miles scale. The crosswind component (V) is not to be
confused with ZN. The crosswind component (V) is crosswind velocity in knots. This component (V)
must then be multiplied by the elapsed time between D2 and D1 in order to compute the ZN. Substitute
ETAS for EAD on the MB-4 computer, and read the ZN over the K factor (or latitude on the subscale).

15.9. Pressure Line of Position (PLOP). After you determine ZN, you need to figure out whether to
plot it left or right of the EAP. Recall that wind circulation is clockwise around a high and
counterclockwise around a low in the Northern Hemisphere; the opposite is true in the Southern
Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, when the value of D increases (a positive D2 - D1), the aircraft
is flying into an area of higher pressure and the drift is left. (Refer to A of Figure 15.10.) When the value
of D decreases (a negative D2 - D1), the aircraft is flying into an area of lower pressure and the drift is
right (B of Figure 15.10). Use the memory device PLOP to remember Plot Left On Positive (in the
Northern hemisphere) Always plot the PLOP parallel to the EAP, as shown in Figure 15.11. Cross the
PLOP with another LOP to form a fix, or use it with a DR position to construct an MPP.


Figure 15.10. Pressure Pattern Displacement.




15.10. Bellamy Drift. Bellamy drift is a mean drift angle calculated for a past period of time. It is
named for Dr John Bellamy who first demonstrated that drift could be obtained from the use of pressure
differential information. Bellamy drift is used in the same way as any other drift reading.

15.10.1. An advantage of Bellamy drift is its independence from external sources. It can serve as a
backup if the primary drift source fails, but will not give groundspeed. Bellamy drift is less accurate than
Doppler or INS derived sources, but is better than using forecast drift or having none at all.
322                                                              AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001

15.10.2. In Figure 15.12, a PLOP has been plotted from the following information:

      D1 at a fix at 1000 hrs
      D2 at an air position at 1045 hrs
      Zn = - 20 NM
      Constant TH of 90o

15.10.3. Next, construct an MPP on the PLOP. This is done by swinging the arc, with a radius equal to
the ground distance traveled, from the fix at the first D reading to intersect the PLOP. The ground
distance traveled can be found by multiplying the best known groundspeed (groundspeed by timing,
metro groundspeed, etc.) by the time interval between readings. The mean track is shown by the line
joining D1 and the MPP. The mean drift is the angle between true heading and the mean track (8oR).
Thus, the Bellamy drift is 8o right.

15.11. MB-4 Solution of Bellamy Drift. Compute Bellamy drift on the slide rule side of the DR
computer by placing the ZN over the ground distance and reading the Bellamy drift angle opposite 57.3
(Figures 15.13 and 15.14). This can be set up in a formula as follows:




   EXAMPLE:

   Given:       ZN = +12.1
                Time = 0:30
                GS = 190 Knots

   Find:        Ground Distance = 95NM
                Drift = 7o left

Section 15Bâ€”Limitations of Pressure Differential Techniques

15.12. Limitations. Pressure navigation is limited by a few meteorological considerations. The basic
accuracy of the LOP in average conditions is about 5 to 10 miles. It will rapidly become worse under the
following conditions: tightly circulating pressure systems of highs and lows, flying through a front, or
carelessness in reading or computing the information. Bellamy drift has another limitation. To determine
drift you must stay on one heading long enough to take two readings about 20 minutes apart.

15.13. Summary. ZN is a displacement in NM perpendicular to the EAP. Compute ZN on the MB-4
using the equation:




Determine ETAS by using the EAD and time. Measure EAD along a straight line between the two
points in question. In the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the sign of the ZN is the sign of the drift
correction. Use airplot in conjunction with a fix position to plot the PLOP, and plot it parallel to the
EAP. If the absolute altimeter fails, use pressure by temperature as a backup. With this method, use
temperature and pressure altitude to find equivalent D readings. If you change altitudes, restart pressure
at the new altitude, or correct the last D reading prior to the altitude change with a pastagram. Another
expression of the PLOP is Bellamy drift, used as a backup source of drift angle. Figure 15.15 shows a
fix determined by a PLOP and a celestial LOP.

                                      NAVIGATION SYSTEMS

Section 16Aâ€”Introduction

16.1. Basics. Navigation systems are computer systems that determine position and calculate navigation
information. They free the operator from the intense mathematical calculations characteristic of DR
navigation to allow additional time for military related activities. Simple navigation systems rely on an
initial position and basic instrument data, like doppler groundspeed and drift, magnetic heading, and
variation, to compute and constantly update the DR position. These systems require the operator to
spend time to maintain system accuracy. Complex systems integrate information from a variety of
sources using complex statistical algorithms to produce constantly updated, highly accurate position and
navigation information. Some components of a navigation system may be stand-alone systems. This
chapter examines navigation systems in general and the most common systems in detailâ€”Inertial
Navigation Systems (INS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS).

Section 16Bâ€”Navigation Systems

16.2. Basics. In the same way an autopilot frees a pilot from the manual operations of flying, a
navigation system relieves you of many manual operations required to direct the aircraft. When sensors
are tied into a navigation system, the system automatically uses their data to compute present position
for the navigator. This reduces the workload and frees you to make the decisions that are beyond the
capability of computers and more effectively employ the weapon system. During a flight from the
United States to a foreign country, the aircraft may pass over areas of land, water, and icecaps. You may
have to deal with conditions of overcast, undercast, day, night, altitude changes, turn points, and air
traffic requirements in addition to weapon system employment. To handle these conditions at high
speeds more effectively, the navigator uses a navigation system.

16.3. Types of Systems. Navigation systems can be classified according to many criteria. Systems can
be classified by capability such as VFR-only or all-weather. They can be classified by mission type such
as ground-attack, air-to-air, or combat support. They can be classified as either self-contained or
externally-referenced. They may also be classified as to whether they emit signals or are passive. Each
system has advantages and disadvantages, but we will confine this discussion to self-contained and
externally referenced systems.

16.3.1. Self-Contained Navigation Systems. Self-contained systems (radar, celestial, INS) are complete
in that and they do not depend upon externally transmitted data. Weapon systems equipped with self-
contained navigation systems can operate anywhere in the world without the assistance of ground- or
space-based transmitters.

16.3.2. Externally-Referenced Navigation Systems. Externally-referenced aids (GPS, NAVAIDs)
include all aids that depend upon transmission of energy or information from an external source to the
aircraft. Externally-referenced navigation systems provide information to anyone, which in time of war
includes the enemy as well as friendly forces. Another disadvantage of externally-referenced aids is their
vulnerability to attack, jamming, or exploitation. While externally referenced aids have enormous
installation and operating costs to the system administrator, they have much lower equipment and
maintenance costs to the user.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                    327

16.4. The Ideal System. Every navigation system has certain advantages and disadvantages. A
particular navigation system is selected for use in an aircraft when its advantages outweigh its
disadvantages. In some cases, several components are included in a system to provide adequate,
redundant information for all possible mission taskings. The ultimate navigation system should have the
following characteristics:

16.4.1. Groundplot DR Information. The system must indicate the position and velocity relative to the
ground.

16.4.2. Global Coverage. Capable of positioning and steering the aircraft accurately and reliably any
place in the world.

16.4.3. Self-Contained. It must not rely on ground or space transmissions of any kind.

16.4.4. Passive Operation. It must not betray the position of the aircraft by transmitting signals of any
kind.

16.4.5. Immune to Countermeasures. The system must not be susceptible to countermeasures of any
type.

16.4.6. Useless to Enemy. It must not provide navigation information or intelligence of any kind to
enemy forces.

16.4.7. Flexible. Works well despite unplanned deviations. The system must work well at all altitudes
and speeds.

16.5. Components. The navigational system consists of three parts: (1) the computer or central
processing unit (CPU), (2) data-gathering sensors like astrotrackers, GPS, ground mapping radar, or
NAVAIDS; and (3) an operator input/output (I/O) interface. The CPU takes in all available data and
converts it into usable navigation information. Control panels or computer keyboards allow the operator
to control and make inputs to the computer. Data is displayed for the operator on display panels, radar
screens, or computer screens. Additional software components might be capable of air-to-ground
delivery, air-to-air intercepts, weapons employment, threat avoidance, and rendezvous. Additional
hardware components could include terrain following radar, television cameras, or threat detection
receivers.

16.6. Computer Unit. Most navigation systems are hybrids of the two basic computer types: analog and
digital.

16.6.1. Analog. Analog computers are more specific in design and function than digital computers.
While analog computers process vast amounts of similar data they are not very flexible and cannot be
used for multiple purposes. Radar scan converters efficiently process collected radar signals into video
images. Video processors collect and process images into video displays. Other examples of analog
computers are terrain-avoidance computers and terrain-following computers.

16.6.2. Digital. Digital computers are lighter and more compact than analog computers. Hand-held
calculators and laptop computers are two examples of the miniaturization possible with digital

limitation is increased cost. An analog radar scan converter is very efficient at processing radar data, but
it cannot be used for other applications. On the other hand, digital computers can be loaded with
navigation software, aerial delivery software, and diagnostic programs. These computers can
mathematically manipulate data in any way imaginable because they deal strictly with digital
information. The output from digital computers may need to be converted into an analog format for most
efficient use by the navigator, however; the digital computer cannot do that. It can display the digital
data in an approximation of analog data. While a digital computer can perform any mathematical
function, it must first be programmed for that function. In-flight reprogramming is not generally
possible.

16.7. Sensors. Many types of sensors are used for inputs to navigation systems.

16.7.1. Astrotracker. The use of astrotrackers has decreased; however, they are still excellent sources
of position information. They automatically track celestial bodies and compute position information
using celestial techniques. They are passive but require clear skies.

16.7.2. Doppler. The doppler radar measures GS and drift. These two data inputs can be put to several
uses in the computer system. Doppler GS is used to determine distance to update the aircraft position.
Drift can be used to compute winds and aircraft track. Doppler outputs can be used in platform leveling
and verifying inertial GS in an inertial navigation system. Doppler radar is an essential part of many
navigation computer systems.

16.7.3. Heading System. The gyro-stabilized magnetic heading source is corrected to true heading with
the local magnetic variation. This can be applied manually or automatically from a database in the
computer. Magnetic or true course can be calculated by applying doppler or inertial drift.

16.7.4. NAVAIDS. NAVAIDS are easily added to a computer system. VOR or TACAN bearings and
DME provide the same information as a radar fix. The computer needs the location and frequency of the
transmitter, which can be programmed into the computer before the mission begins. Some corrections
must be applied to bearing data. The computer must correct for magnetic variation and slant range from
the station to the aircraft.

16.7.5. Pressure Altimeter. Pressure altimeter data is an input to the true airspeed computations.
Additionally it can be used with temperature data to compute true altitude.

16.7.6. Radar. When a ground mapping radar is incorporated into the navigation system, present
position can be corrected based on the measurements to surveyed radar returns. The operator identifies
radar returns on his radar scope and measures the range and bearing to the return. The operator
determines the aircraft position relative to the return and updates the aircraft position. Automatic
systems allows the operator to pre-load the coordinates of radar returns in a database, place a movable
electronic cursor (or crosshairs) on the return, and push a button to update the system. The computer
determines the distance and bearing from the aircraft to the set coordinates. The computer then generates
the cursor on the radarscope at the calculated range and bearing. If there is any error in the navigation
system position, the cursor will not fall on the radar return. The operator adjusts the cursor or crosshairs
onto the radar return. The operator pushes a button to automatically update the system.

16.7.7. Temperature Sensors. The air data computer uses the information collected by temperature
sensors. Temperature gradients can be used with pressure altimeter data to compute true altitude.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     329

16.7.8. True Airspeed. True airspeed can be calculated from indicated airspeed, temperature, and
pressure. True airspeed and winds can be used as a backup for cross-checking ground speed.

16.7.9. Independent Systems. INS and GPS can also act as sensors for a navigation system. They are
discussed in greater detail later in this chapter.

16.8. Determining Position. The ever-present problem facing the navigator is determining aircraft
position. With a navigation system this problem is solved because the computer converts input data into
a constantly updated present position for the aircraft. Advanced systems provide altitude, attitude,
heading, and velocity information.

16.8.1. The mathematics of navigation over the surface of a sphere has been known for several centuries.
Starting from an initial position the computer determines the distance and direction traveled since
starting navigation. Aircraft direction, or track, may be supplied by INS, GPS, or the heading reference
system in combination with doppler drift. Ground speed may come from INS, GPS, or doppler ground
speed, or may be determined from any NAVAID capable of range and bearing fixes. The computer
multiplies speed against time interval to determine distance traveled. Distance is projected along the
aircraft track to obtain the new position. Track and speed are sampled and present position is updated
many times per second. Waypoint navigation is a simple addition to the navigation computer.

16.8.2. A database of coordinates can be added to the system to determine distance to go and estimated
time of arrival. If the aircraft changes speed, the ETA is automatically updated using the new ground
speed.

16.9. Decision Algorithm. Simple navigation systems determine position as described above. The
operator updates the position for errors that will eventually occur. More complex systems have
additional problems. When a system has a variety of sources that provides redundant information, how
does the computer decide which source to use? What if the sensors are subject to errors? What if the
operator inputs an inaccurate update to the system? How can we get a computer to make simple
decisions once left to the navigator? Can we program a computer to analyze and correct for the
predictable and unpredictable errors in sensor data? Bias in the accuracy and variability of data are two
types of error that navigation systems actually experience and can be solved with the use of statistical
software called decision algorithms.

16.9.1. To compensate for these predictable and unpredictable errors in sensor data, we can include
statistical measuring software that will weigh the accuracy of each data source and the accuracy of the
data itself. These programs will determine the most likely value for track and velocity in order to
compute the most likely present position.

16.9.2. One type of program used to determine the most likely sensor values is called a Kalman filter.
Kalman filters are used extensively in computer controlled communications, electronics, and equipment.
When used as part of a navigation system, a Kalman filter computes the most likely position of the
aircraft and updates the weighing factors with each new position update. The Kalman filter compares the
actual sensor data used prior to the update with the data from the update. By comparing the first position
with the second position, actual distance and heading can be determined. It then determines the amount
of error in the original data and estimates a correction to the data for the next time period. The Kalman
filter is an iterative program requiring several updates prior to achieving completely reliable data. If
used, the Kalman filter will also be used to evaluate the reliability of operator inputs and weigh how
330                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

much of each position update to accept. Kalman filtering provides increased reliability in navigation
systems so an operator can trust that the information used is valid. Kalman filters protect the operator
from inaccurate sensor data and even operator error.

Section 16Câ€”Inertial Navigation System (INS)

16.10. Basics. Inertial navigation is accepted as an ideal navigation system because it meets all the
criteria of an ideal system. INS provides worldwide ground plot information regardless of flight path and
aircraft performance. An INS can measure GS independently of wind and independently of the operating
environment. INS is completely independent of ground transmissions, immune to enemy
countermeasures, and passive in operation. It is self-contained and portable; most units weigh less than
100 pounds. Some ring laser gyro systems weigh as little as 20 pounds. The need for a system with these
properties has spurred development to the point where INS is superior to almost every other navigation
system. INS provides accurate velocity information instantaneously for all maneuvers, as well as an
accurate attitude and heading reference. INS accuracy decreases as the time between position updates
increases. INS will maintain its accuracy for short sorties without position updates; however, longer
sorties may require periodic in-flight updates.

16.11. Types of Inertial Systems. In the last several years inertial technology has taken several leaps
forward. Early inertials were bulky devices weighing several hundred pounds, whose installation had to
be precise and whose operation had to be planned in great detail. Today there are compact systems that
fit in a briefcase and can be bolted to an aircraft in any space available. While some inertial systems still
have mechanical gyroscopes, pendulous linear accelerometers, and space stable platforms, most have
evolved to keep pace with the advances in technology. Acoustic gyros, ring laser gyros, and
electronically suspended gyros have replaced the gimbaled gyroscope. Laser and acoustic
accelerometers are replacing the pendulous linear accelerometer. Highly accurate computers and
precision sensors have led to modifications of the space stable platform so the INS housing does not
need to be accurately aligned with the aircraft. Eventually software will perform all the functions of the
space stable platform. Despite all these modern advances, we can better learn about and understand
inertial systems by studying the original systems.

16.12. Principles. The basic principle behind inertial navigation is straightforward. Starting from a
known point, you calculate your present position (a continuously running DR) from the direction and
speed traveled since starting navigation. The difference between other navigation systems and INS is
how it determines direction, distances, and velocities. Accelerations are detected by the three linear
accelerometers. These accelerations are integrated over time to determine changes in velocity. Velocity
is integrated a second time to determine distance traveled. Changes in vector direction are detected with
angular accelerometers. As sensors detect changes in gyroscope orientation, correction signals are
generated to reorient the stable platform to the original position and determine new vector direction. INS
requires no other inputs. It avoids all environmental inputs such as indicated or true airspeed, magnetic
heading, drift, and winds that are necessary for dead reckoning.

16.13. Components. The five basic components of an INS are:

16.13.1. Three linear accelerometers arranged orthogonally to supply the x, y, and z axis components of
acceleration.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                        331

16.13.2. Gyroscopes to measure and use changes in aircraft vector to maintain and orient the stable
platform.

16.13.3. A stable platform oriented to keep the x and y axis linear accelerometers oriented north-south
and east-west to provide azimuth orientation and to keep the z axis aligned with the local gravity vector.
The stable platform is necessary to prevent either the x or y axis accelerometer from picking up the force
of gravity and interpreting it as an acceleration on the aircraft.

16.13.4. Integrators to convert raw acceleration data into velocity and distance data.

16.13.5. A computer to continuously calculate position information.

16.14. Linear Accelerometers. Acceleration-measuring devices are the heart of all inertial systems. It is
important that they function reliably for all maneuvers within the capability of the aircraft, and that all
possible sources of error are minimized. Very slight accelerations and changes in heading in all
directions must be detected. Changes in temperature and pressure must not affect INS operation. To do
this, INS requires two types of accelerometers, linear and angular. The simplest type of linear
accelerometer consists of a pendulous mass that is free to rotate about a pivot axis in the instrument.
There is an electrical pickoff that converts the rotation of the pendulous mass about its pivot axis into an
output signal. This output signal is used to torque the pendulum to hold it in the original position and,
since the signal is proportional to the measured acceleration, it is sent to the navigation computer as an
acceleration output signal (Figure 16.1). To obtain acceleration in all directions, three accelerometers are
mounted mutually perpendicular in a fixed orientation. To convert acceleration into useful information,
the acceleration signals must be integrated to produce velocity and then the velocity information is
integrated to get the distance traveled. One of the forces measured by the linear accelerometers is
gravity. This acceleration may be incorrectly interpreted as an acceleration of the aircraft if the stabilized
platform is tilted relative to the local gravity vector. The accelerometers cannot distinguish between
actual acceleration and the force of gravity. This means that the linear accelerometers on the stable
platform must be kept level relative to the earth's surface (perpendicular to the local gravity vector). The
gyroscopes keep the stabilized platform and the accelerometers level and oriented in a north-south and
east-west direction.

332                                                                 AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

16.15. Gyroscopes. Gyroscopes are used in inertial systems to measure angular acceleration and
changes in orientation and heading. While the types of gyros are briefly discussed here, the function of
the gyro is discussed in great detail in the next section on the stable platform. The original gimbaled
gyroscope has been replaced by newer designs.

16.15.1. Electronically Suspended Gyros. These gimbal-less gyros consist of a ball that is suspended
in a magnetic field and spun electronically. Evacuating the air in the gyro cavity further reduces friction.
The result is a near frictionless gyro with precession rates measured in years. Optical sensors measure
the ball's orientation from symbols etched on the surface of the ball.

16.15.2. Ring Laser Gyro. Accuracy and dependability of first generation systems have greatly
improved with the introduction of the ring laser gyro (RLG) INS. The RLG INS replaces the three
pendulous mass accelerometers with three RLG accelerometers. Technically the RLG is not a gyroscope
since it has no moving parts, but it gives the same information as a gyro. A RLG is made from a single
block of glass with three holes drilled through the glass to form a triangular path. Two of the openings
are plugged with mirrors and the triangular tube is filled with helium neon or other lazing gas. When the
gas is charged, the lazing gas produces two counter-rotating laser beams that are reflected around the
path by the mirrors. Both laser beams emerge through the third hole in the glass and are superimposed
upon each other to produce an interference pattern. As the RLG moves, one beam has a longer path to
travel; the other a shorter path. This causes changes in the interference pattern, which are detected by
photocells. The angular rate and direction of motion are computed as accelerations.

16.15.3. Acoustic Gyros. Another recent development is the inertial sensor based on vibrating quartz
crystal technology. Like the RLG, these are not true gyros. Acoustic gyros are manufactured from a
single piece of microminiature quartz rate sensor. Angular accelerations affect the patterns produced by
a vibrating tuning fork and result in torque on the fork proportional to the angular acceleration. These
gyros appeared in inertial units in the late 1990s.

16.16. Stable Platform. Stable platforms have been used for years in bombing and fire control systems.
Autopilots and attitude indicators use gyrostabilized platforms. Inertial navigation simply requires a
stable platform with higher specifications of accuracy. A gyro-stabilized platform on which
accelerometers are mounted is called a stable element. It is isolated from the aircraft's angular motions
by three concentric gimbals. The stable element is the mounting for the linear accelerometers,
gyroscopes, and other supporting equipment. The supporting equipment includes torque motors, servo
motors, pickoffs, amplifiers, and wiring. The effectiveness of the stable platform is determined by all
parts of the platform, not just the accelerometers and gyros.

16.16.1. The linear accelerometers measure acceleration in all directions and the gyros control the
orientation of the platform. The platform must contain at least two gyros with two degrees of freedom. A
simple diagram of a two-degrees-of-freedom gyro mounted on a single-axis platform is shown in Figure
16.2. If one-degree-of-freedom rate gyros are used, three units are needed, each gyro having its own
independent feedback and control loop. The original gimbaled gyro was not very accurate by today's
standards, producing sizeable amounts of gyroscopic precession. Recent developments such as the air-
bearing gyro and the electronically suspended gyro have only 1/10,000,000 the friction of a standard
gyro and negligible real precession. Today's gyros have real precession rates of less than 360Â° in 30
years.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                        333

Figure 16.2. Stable Platform.




16.16.2. The desired property of a gyro that we want to capitalize on is its stability in space. A spinning
gyro tends to remain in its original position. A free spinning gyro aligned in space tends to remain
pointed in the same direction unless a force acts on it. On a stable platform, any displacement of the
stable element from its frame of reference is sensed by the electrical pickoffs in the gyroscopes. These
electrical signals are amplified and used to drive the platform gimbals to realign the stable element in the
original position. More advanced INS have a four-gimbal platform in a three-axis configuration (Figure
16.3).


Figure 16.3. Gimbal Platform.




16.16.3. The four-gimbal mounting provides a full 360Â° freedom of rotation about the stable element,
thus allowing it to remain level with respect to local gravity and to remain oriented to true north. This is
north as established by the gyros and accelerometers, regardless of the in-flight attitude of the aircraft.
The azimuth, pitch, and outer roll gimbals have a 360Â° freedom of rotation about their own individual
axis. The fourth or inner roll gimbal has stops limiting its rotation about its axis. This gimbal is provided
334                                                                 AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

to prevent gimbal lock, which is a condition that causes the stable element to tumble. Gimbal lock can
occur during flight maneuvers, such as a loop, when two of the gimbal axes become aligned parallel to
each other, causing the stable element to lose one of its degrees of freedom.

16.17. Measuring Horizontal Acceleration. The key to a successful inertial system is absolute
accuracy in measuring horizontal accelerations. A slight tilt of the stable platform will introduce a
component of earth's gravity as acceleration on the aircraft and will result in incorrect distances and
velocities (Figure 16.4). Keeping the accelerometers level is the job of the feedback circuit. The
computer calculates distance traveled along the surface of the earth and moves the accelerometer
through an equivalent arc. Several factors affect aligning the accelerometer using this method. The earth
is not a sphere, but an oblate spheroid or geoid. Because the earth is not a smooth surface, there are local
deviations in the direction of gravity. The feedback circuit operates on the premise that the arc traversed
is proportional to distance traveled. Actually, the arc varies considerably because of the earth's shape;
the variation is greatest at the poles. The computer must solve for this irregularity in converting distance
to arc.


Figure 16.4. Effect of Accelerometer Tilt.




16.17.1. The accelerometers are kept level relative to astronomical rather than geocentric latitude. Using
the astronomical latitude, the accelerometers are kept aligned with the local horizon and also with the
earth's gravitational field. Feedback from the computer keeps the accelerometers level, correcting for
two types of apparent precession. If the inertial unit were stationary at the equator, it would be necessary
to rotate the accelerometers to maintain them level because of the earth's angular rotation of 15Â° per
hour. Also, movement of the stabilized platform would require corrections to keep the accelerometers
level. When using a local horizontal system, in which the accelerometers are maintained directly on the
gyro platform, the gyro platform must be torqued by a signal from the computer to keep the platform
horizontal. Apparent precession is illustrated in Figure 16.5.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                    335

Figure 16.5. Apparent Precession.




16.17.2. A slight error in maintaining the horizontal would induce a major error in distance computation.
If an accelerometer picked up an error signal of 1/100 of the G-force, the error on a 1-hour flight would
be 208,000 feet (over 34 NM). In 1923, Dr Maxmillian Schuler showed a pendulum with a period of
84.4 minutes could solve the problem of eliminating inadvertent acceleration errors.

16.17.3. If a pendulum has a period of 84.4 minutes, it will indicate the vertical, regardless of
acceleration of the vehicle. He demonstrated that a device with a period of 84.4 minutes would remain
vertical to the horizon despite any acceleration on the device. The fundamental principle of the 84.4-
minute theorem is that if a pendulum had an arm equal in length to the radius of the earth, gravity would
have no effect on the bob. This is because the center of the bob would be at the center of gravity of the
earth and the pendulum arm would always remain vertical for all motions of the pivot point. While it
would be impossible to construct this pendulum, devices with an 84.4-minute cycle can be constructed
using gyroscopes. The Schuler pendulum phenomenon prevents the accumulation of errors which would
be caused by platform tilt and treating gravity as an acceleration. It will not compensate for errors in
azimuth resulting from the precession of the steering gyro. The amplitude of the Schuler cycle depends
upon the overall accuracy of the system. Figure 16.6 shows the Schuler-tuned system.
336                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 16.6. Schuler Pendulum Phenomenon.




16.17.4. A spinning, untorqued gyro is space-oriented and will appear to move as the earth rotates
underneath it. This is undesirable for older systems because the accelerometers will not be kept
perpendicular to the local vertical. To earth-orient the gyro, we control apparent precession. If a force is
applied to the axis of a spinning gyro wheel that is free to move in a gimballing structure, the wheel will
move in a direction at right angles to the applied force. This is called torquing a gyro and can be
considered as mechanized or induced precession. A continuous torque, applied to the appropriate axis by
electromagnetic elements called torques, reorients the gyro wheel to maintain the stable element level
with respect to the earth, and keeps it pointed north. An analog or digital computer determines the torque
to be applied to the gyros through a loop that is tuned using the Schuler pendulum principle. The
necessary correction for earth rate depends on the position of the aircraft; the correction to be applied
about the vertical axis depends on the velocity of the aircraft.

16.17.5. It is important that the stable element be accurately leveled with respect to the local vertical and
aligned in azimuth with respect to true north. Precise leveling of the stable element is accomplished
prior to flight by the accelerometers that measure acceleration in the horizontal plane. The stable
element is moved until the output of the x and y accelerometers is zero, indicating that they are not
measuring any component of gravity and that the platform is level. Azimuth alignment to TN is
accomplished before flight by starting with the magnetic compass output and applying variation to
roughly come up with TN reference. From this point, gyrocompassing is performed. This process makes
use of the ability of the gyros to sense the rotation of the earth. If the stable element is misaligned in
azimuth, the east gyro will see the wrong earth rate and will cause a precession about the east axis. This
precession will cause the north accelerometer to tilt. The output of this accelerometer is then used to
torque the azimuth and east gyro to ensure a TN alignment and a level condition.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                         337

16.17.6. In the more modern gyroscopes, the gyro cannot be physically torqued because the gyro is
either not moving or the gyro is electronically suspended. In these systems, the stable platform is leveled
mathematically using gyro data. The precise orientation of the x and y accelerometers on the stable
platform is less critical since the computer can mathematically correct for any orientation. The next
generation of INS may work without a stable platform, with orientation and stability maintained
mathematically from accelerometer inputs.

16.18. Integrator. Simply stated, the processing of acceleration is done with an integrator. An integrator
integrates the input to produce an output: it multiplies the input signal by the time it was present.
Accurate navigation demands extremely accurate integration of both acceleration and velocity. One of
the most used analog integrators is the DC amplifier, which uses a charging current stabilized to a
specific value proportional to an input voltage. Another analog integrator is the AC tachometer-
generator, which uses an input to turn a motor, which physically turns the tachometer-generator,
producing an output voltage. The rotation of the motor is proportional to an integral of acceleration.

16.19. Computer. The computer changes the integrators' outputs into useful navigation information. To
do this, one accelerometer is mounted aligned to north and another is mounted 90Â° to the first, to sense
east-west accelerations. Any movement of this system indicates distance traveled east-west and north-
south. The INS maintains a local vertical reference and measures distance traveled over a reference
spheroid perpendicular to the local vertical. On this spheroid, the latitude and longitude of the present
position are continuously measured by the integration of velocity. In Figure 16.7, Î¸ represents latitude
and Î» represents longitude. The axes are designated x, y, and z, corresponding to east, north, and local
vertical. This defines their positive directions. References to velocities, attitude angles, and rotation rates
are about the x, y, and z axes. The local vertical (z) is established by platform leveling. This is the most
fundamental reference direction. To complete platform alignment, the INS uses gyrocompassing to
establish true north (y). Gyrocompassing establishes platform alignment to the earth's axis of revolution
or North Pole. The INS is capable of doing this to an accuracy of 10 minutes of arc or less. After
alignment, the platform remains oriented to TN and the local vertical, regardless of the maneuvers of the
aircraft.

16.19.1. GS components of velocity in track (V) are measured by the system along the x and y axes, as
shown in Figure 16.8. These components, Vx and Vy include all effects on the aircraft, such as wind,
thermals, engine accelerations, and speed brake decelerations. Some form of digital readout usually
displays the GS (V).

16.19.2. The angles between the aircraft attitude and the platform reference attitude are continuously
measured by synchros. The aircraft yaws, rolls, and pitches about the platform in a set of gimbals, each
gimbal being rotated through some component of attitude. TH is measured as the horizontal angle
between the aircraft's longitudinal axis and platform north. Roll and pitch angles are measured by
synchro transmitters on the platform roll and pitch gimbals.

16.20. Summary. INS technology has advanced very rapidly within the past few years. Advanced
navigation systems are commonly designed with INS as an essential component. INS reliability is

exceptional and INS accuracies are second only to GPS. Traditional INS design has capitalized on the
advances of the digital computer to increase system responsiveness.

Section 16Dâ€”NAVSTAR Global Positioning System

16.21. Basics. Deployment of the NAVSTAR GPS constellation of satellites began with the first launch
in 1977. The satellites were launched into precisely controlled orbits, allowing users with GPS
equipment to receive data to determine their position. The phenomenal accuracy of GPS was its major
selling point, but its many different applications were a close second. GPS determines a position
referenced to a common grid known as the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). The WGS 84 grid
is based upon a mathematical model and compensates for the fact that the earth is not a perfect sphere
(Figure 16.9). Derived using precise satellite measurements, it creates an accurate model of the earth's
surface. As a consequence, WGS 84 provides extremely accurate information when compared to older
traditional datum references. The value of the WGS 84 grid is that positional data can be standardized
worldwide. Many receiver sets are capable of converting WGS 84 data into these other commonly used
references.


Figure 16.9. World Geodetic System 1984.




16.22. Military Applications. In air operations, GPS accuracy can improve en route and terminal
navigation, reducing flight times and fuel consumption. Since it is a three-dimensional system, descent,
approach, and landing operations can be monitored more closely. In combat-related applications, GPS
performance can improve weapons delivery, airdrops, rendezvous, and threat avoidance. Since GPS
requires the use of a common grid, coordination of air, ground, and sea operations can be greatly
improved. These include close air support, search and rescue, rendezvous, and airdrop operations.

16.22.1. For ground forces, GPS can provide similar advantages. Its accuracy will enhance site
surveying, field artillery placement, and target acquisition. First-round artillery effectiveness can be
improved based on precise knowledge of the location of friendly firepower, coupled with forward-
340                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

observer determinations of enemy locations and movement. Special forces can operate with greater
precision closer to enemy forces. GPS can also provide benefits to naval forces. Harbor entry operations
can be improved. Coastal survey operations can be conducted more quickly and effectively. Mine
placement and countermeasure operations can be conducted with greater precision and safety.

16.22.2. In the area of Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I), GPS performs a
vital function by providing worldwide nuclear detonation (NUDET) detection capability to the National
Command Authorities (NCA). Each GPS satellite carries a sensor capable of detecting nuclear
detonations. This surveillance capability can be used in verifying future Nuclear Test Ban treaties. More
importantly, it provides the NCA with the means of monitoring and reacting to a nuclear confrontation
should the need arise.

16.23. Civilian Applications. Although originally conceived and developed as a military-only project,
GPS information is available to anyone in the civilian community with a receiver. It provides a broad
spectrum of civilian users with accurate position, velocity, and time information at a reasonable cost. In
addition to military uses and benefits, GPS is being used in such diverse areas as oil and mineral
exploration, geophysical surveys, airborne collision avoidance, and maritime hazard systems. Anyone
can buy hand-held GPS receivers with 100-meter accuracy for less then $300. The potential applications
for GPS are boundless. The civilian community has a great deal of interest in the applications of GPS,
and more sophisticated uses are developed every day.

16.24. General System Description. The GPS system is made up of three segmentsâ€”space, user, and
control.

16.24.1. Space Segment. The space segment is composed of 24 satellites plus 3 operational spares in 6
orbital planes (Figure 16.10). The orbits are arranged precisely such that a minimum of four satellites are
in view at all times worldwide. The design life of each satellite is 7.5 years with an average mission
duration of 6 years.

16.24.2. User Segment. The user segment consists of user equipment (UE) sets (Figure 16.11), test
equipment, and associated support equipment. The UE set, using data transmitted by the satellites,
determines the user's position, altitude, and velocity. Transmissions from the satellites also allow the UE
set to evaluate the accuracy of the navigational information being received. This is based on built-in
checks of its own performance, the configuration of the satellite constellation in view, and the jamming-
to-signal ratios being experienced by the set.

16.24.3. Control Segment. The control segment (Figure 16.12) includes a network of monitor stations
and ground antennas placed throughout the world. The monitor stations track all satellites in view and
342                                                                AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

monitor general health of the system. Data from the monitor stations is sent to and processed at the
Master Control Station (MCS). This data is then used to refine and update the satellites' navigational
signals. These corrections are transmitted to the individual satellites via ground antennas. The
operational master control station is collocated with the Consolidated Space Operations Center at
Peterson Field CO. Three ground antenna stations are located at Diego Garcia, Ascension Island, and
Kwajalein. Five monitor stations will be positioned in Hawaii, Colorado, and at the three ground antenna
locations.

16.25. Theory of Operation. A UE set is capable of determining position, velocity, and time
information by receiving ranging signals from a number of satellites. By measuring the difference
between signal transmission and reception times and multiplying that time interval (Dt) by the speed of
light, range to the satellite can be determined. In a general sense, this is very similar to the way TACAN
DME functions, with one important difference.

16.25.1. TACAN DME is an active system in that a signal must be sent from the aircraft to the selected
TACAN ground station. The ground station in turn sends a reply signal back to the aircraft. The
TACAN set then measures the Dt and then computes and displays the range to the station. GPS is a
passive system; no signal is transmitted by the UE set to the satellite. How does the user or receiver
determine when the signal was transmitted by the satellite? The solution is to encode the satellite signal
so the receiver knows when it was transmitted.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                        343

16.25.2. In order to encode the signal with its transmission time, the satellite generates what is known as
a pseudorandom noise (PRN) sequence or code. This code is broadcast continuously from each satellite.
At the same time, the UE set simultaneously generates an identical code. When the set receives the
satellite's signal, it compares it with the code that it has been generating. If a signal arrives at the
receiver with the same code generated two seconds ago, we know that the satellite's signal took 2
seconds to reach us (Figure 16.13).


Figure 16.13. PRN Code Comparison.




16.25.3. If we know the satellite's location in space and our distance from it, we know we are
somewhere on the sphere having the satellite as its center. With two satellites in view, the user's position
is somewhere on the circle representing the intersection of two spheres. A third satellite provides an
additional sphere of position whose intersection with the other two will define a three-dimensional
navigation fix, with timing errors. Figure 16.14 illustrates this concept in two dimensions for clarity. A
fourth allows us to eliminate most of the timing errors. The accuracy of the navigation fix would be
dependent on (1) the accuracy of the measurement process (how accurately is the digital signal
processed), (2) the accuracy of the satellite positions, and (3) the accuracy and stability of the satellites'
clocks and the receiver clock. The user equipment should be able to track the satellite's signal to within 3
nanoseconds (3 x 10-9 seconds). This is equivalent to a 1-meter error in position. If navigational
accuracy on the order of 10 meters is desired, we must be able to establish satellite position at a
particular time to within at least 10 meters. This is not a trivial problem. Since the satellite is moving
and is subject to complex gravitational attractions and solar winds, measuring and predicting its position
within 10 meters as a function of time is quite difficult. Fortunately, this ephemeris (orbital) data is
transmitted to the receiver in the form of almanac data.

16.25.4. Ground stations continuously monitor each satellite so its position can be corrected and passed
to the other satellites in the network. Each satellite in reception range transmits its coordinates, a time
factor correction and other data. The receiver solves simultaneous equations for the unknown receiver
coordinates and the correct time. Four channel GPS receivers can use one channel per satellite to
maintain continuous lock on and update. Receivers with less than four channels must continuously
switch frequencies and hunt for new satellites that can limit the system responsiveness.
344                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 16.14. Resolution of Position.




16.25.5. The satellites transmit two code signals, the precision (P) code on 1227.6 MHz and the coarse
acquisition (C/A) code on 1575.42 MHz (Figure 16.15). Both codes carry the same types of information.
The C/A code will be transmitted with intentional errors to deny the highly accurate position from
unauthorized users. The P code, like its relative, the encrypted Y code, does not include these intentional
errors. To circumvent the Y code encryption, differential GPS (DGPS) receivers are being designed that
will receive general GPS signals as well as a fifth signal from a ground-based transmitter. These
differential transmitters can easily determine the intentional error by comparing their GPS position to the
surveyed coordinates of the transmitter. The difference is the intentional error. The ground transmitters
will compute and relay the amount of intentional bias in the C/A code so receivers can remove the
position error without use of the P or Y codes.


Figure 16.15. Signal Bandwidth.




16.26. Clock Error and Pseudo Range. We assumed in the previous discussion that both the satellite
and the UE set were generating identical pseudo codes at exactly the same time. Practically speaking,
this is not the case. Each satellite carries an atomic clock accurate to 10-9 seconds. Achieving maximum
accuracy in synchronizing the codes would require all users to carry atomic clocks with comparable
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                        345

accuracies, significantly increasing both the size and cost of each receiver set. As a compromise, each
UE set is equipped with a quartz crystal clock.

16.26.1. Since the accuracy of a quartz crystal clock cannot approach that of an atomic clock, there is a
difference between satellite GPS system time and UE set time. As a result, the generation of the two
pseudo codes is not perfectly synchronized and a ranging error will be induced. Instead of determining
actual range, we will measure the apparent or pseudo range to the satellite. This particular problem area
is known as clock bias.

16.26.2. Clock bias affects all range measurements equally. The problem is determining the amount of
bias error. Using three satellites allows us to determine our position in three dimensions. By using a
fourth satellite and comparing pseudo codes, the UE set internally determines the amount of adjustment
necessary to make all of the measurements agree.

16.27. Satellite Clock Error. It might be safe to assume that since each satellite carries an atomic clock,
it would keep extremely accurate time. Since the compact dimensions of an orbiting satellite limit the
clock size, its accuracy does not approach that of ground based atomic clocks. As a consequence, there
will be some error in each satellite's clock when compared with "master" GPS system time. The
satellite's generation of the pseudo code will be slightly out of synch and some ranging error will be
induced. This problem is known as satellite clock error. To compensate for this type of error, the GPS
control segment comes into play. Monitor stations evaluate the accuracy of the satellite's clock and its
pseudo code generation. This information is then relayed to the master control station where the
necessary corrections to the satellite's transmissions are computed. Updated information is then
uploaded to the satellite via the ground antennas.

16.28. Ephemeris Error. Ephemeris is the ability to determine the location of a celestial body (in this
case a satellite) at regular time intervals. Ephemeris error then is caused by the satellite not being exactly
where we thought it was. By using estimation theory techniques, the computers at the master control
station predict what the satellite's position should be at a specific time. This predicted position is then
compared with the actual position as determined by the monitor stations. Updated information on the
satellite's future position is then uploaded to each satellite on a regular basis via the ground antennas.
Each satellite then continuously transmits these corrections to all users. In this way, ranging error caused
by uncertainty as to the satellite's exact position is minimized.

16.29. Atmospheric Propagation Error. We assumed that the satellite's RF signal traveled at the speed
of light, as it does in a vacuum like space. But just as light is refracted through a prism, the RF signal is
bent and slowed down as it enters the ionosphere. The degree to which the signal is affected depends on
the atmospheric conditions between the satellite and receiver and on the signal's angle as it passes
through the ionosphere. Atmospheric propagation error can cause position uncertainties up to 40 meters.
By noting the time delay between the two L-Band signals, much of the effect caused by atmospheric
propagation can be removed internally by the UE set. Since only the military will be capable of
simultaneously monitoring both of the frequencies, civilian users will be forced to live with this error.

16.30. Survivability and Security. For the GPS system to be successful, it must be able to survive and
operate in spite of hostile actions against it. From the program's outset, GPS development efforts have
emphasized the importance of system survivability. The potential threats to the space, control, and user
segments have been scrutinized and counter threat features have been incorporated into the system's
design.
346                                                                 AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

16.30.1. The main threat to the space segment is direct attack of GPS satellites by lasers, particle beam
weapons, and anti-satellite missiles. To counter these threats, all satellites incorporate nuclear and laser
hardening features. Since GPS employs a large constellation of satellites with three orbiting spares, the
direct attack on a small number of satellites will not render the entire system inoperative. Rather, it
would lead to a gradual degradation of system performance. If a satellite is destroyed, a spare will be
positioned near the failed satellite. If a spare is not located nearby, adjacent satellites will be moved to
provide optimum coverage until a new satellite can be launched and positioned. There will be a period
of a few hours during which a satellite being repositioned will be unavailable for service and up to 24
hours if one of the backup atomic clocks is brought into service. The overall impact on the system will
be minimal.

16.30.2. The control segment, composed of the MCS and the remotely located monitor stations and
ground antennas, could be subject to direct enemy attack, sabotage, or high-energy jammers. To counter
control segment threats, redundant monitor and ground antennas were used so that deactivation of any
one station will not affect the system as a whole. To protect against enemy attack or sabotage, a high
security protection system is employed at the MCS, monitor stations, and ground antennas. To counter
the threat of jamming or spoofing, encrypted data is used in all ground-to-space telemetry command and
control links. In the event the MCS is destroyed or unable to upload data to the satellites, the system will
not collapse. The system will suffer some gradual degradation of performance, but GPS will remain a
viable navigational aid.

16.30.3. The key threats to the user equipment sets include electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from nuclear
detonations and jamming or spoofing from unfriendly sources. Should hostile activity result in short-
term GPS system outages, the impact on navigation should be minimal since most aircraft have a
navigator as a crewmember, or are equipped with a self-contained navigation system (such as an INS).
To counter the effects of EMP, all military sets are radiation hardened. To reduce or negate the impact of
jamming or spoofing, the spread-spectrum L-band satellite signals provide substantial resistance.

16.30.4. In extremely hostile electronic warfare environments, high dynamic sets, in conjunction with
systems such as INS, have been designed to further counter the jamming threat. Such sets are
sophisticated enough to estimate the approximate ranging data they should receive from each selected
satellite. If the received signal does not match this expected data, it is rejected as being spurious and is
ignored when determining the user's position. The possibility always exists that unfriendly forces could
use the system during national or international conflicts. To preclude this possibility, the selective
availability features will permit authorized users to navigate with full accuracy while unauthorized users
will experience degraded navigational performance. However, recent advances in DGPS and local area
augmentation can now provide equal or better accuracy than the encrypted Y code signal and are
available to virtually everyone.

16.31. Summary. GPS accuracy is unquestionable, producing accuracies within meters. An INS backup
cannot be jammed or intercepted and will provide acceptable accuracy in all weather. Combination INS-
GPS units in development now will be standard equipment by the end of the century. New computers
that take up less room than a briefcase can process multiple inputs from several sensors (GPS, INS, and
Doppler) and will also provide wind, heading, course, distance, and time information automatically.
Nevertheless, we always include an aviator as part of a weapon system. This is especially true on
complex operational missions requiring the flexibility that only a person can provide. On such a mission,
these sophisticated pieces of equipment are only tools that an aviator uses to make important decisions.

                                     LOW-LEVEL NAVIGATION

Section 17Aâ€”Introduction

17.1. Basics. The main reasons for conducting low-level operations are to gain the element of surprise,
to avoid detection or interception, and to minimize the effect of enemy defenses. Operations such as
personnel drops and aerial resupply missions demand a low-level capability. The problem of performing
accurate navigation at low altitudes differs considerably from that at higher altitudes. Low-level
navigation requires comprehensive flight planning, accurate dead reckoning (DR), and extensive use of
all available aids. You must work very rapidly to obtain and interpret in-flight observations. In general,
low altitude flying affects the navigation problem because of reduced radar and visual range, potential
adverse weather situations, and the need for reactive decision making. In addition, the normal mechanics
of navigation such as writing, computing, and plotting are made difficult or impossible by turbulence
encountered at low altitudes.

Section 17Bâ€”Planning the Mission

17.2. Basics. The key to successful low-level navigation is careful and comprehensive planning
accomplished prior to the flight. Every minute spent in flight planning helps to ensure the low-level
mission will be successful.

17.3. Route Determination. Carefully select the route with emphasis upon navigational checkpoints,
safety of flight, and possible threats. Turn points should be over or close to identifiable points, such as
those that provide good land-water contrast or give good radar definition at maximum range.

17.3.1. Directness. To conserve time and fuel, the route should be as direct as possible. A direct route
also minimizes the time spent within range of enemy defenses such as surface-to-air missiles or air-to-
air interceptors.

17.3.2. Radius of Turn. Compute radius of turns for all turn points since the aircraft must roll out on
course (unless flying point to point). Remember that flying faster or slower than flight planned airspeed
will change your turn radius.

17.3.3. Altitude. Terrain elevation, both along the intended flight path and adjacent to it, is an extremely
important factor when planning mission altitudes. Normal altitudes for low-level combat missions are
between 100 and 500 feet above ground level. On domestic training missions, adhere to the flight rules
in FLIP.

17.3.4. Altimeter Errors. Two types of altimeter errors enter into consideration when planning a low-
level mission. They are caused by (1) differences in barometric pressure along the route of flight and (2)
known deficiencies in the altimeter. You can obtain reliable information along the route from the
forecaster during the weather briefing or from the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC).

17.3.5. Airspeed. Normally, low-level missions are flight planned for airspeeds that make mental DR
computations simple. These are 240 knots (4 NM per minute), 300 knots (5 NM per minute), 360 knots
348                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

(6 NM per minute), etc. While it is important to maintain a constant GS for accurate DR, you may have
to vary the GS to control the time of arrival at turn points and over the target.

17.3.6. Fuel Planning. Fuel consumption is a major consideration in low-level planning. Aircraft
consume more fuel at low altitude than they do at high altitude. Since combat sorties leave very small
fuel tolerances for recovery, carefully plan all phases to conserve fuel. The navigator usually assists the
pilot by closely monitoring fuel quantities. The fuel consumption problem is further complicated by the
variable load requirements for specific missions.

17.3.7. Threats. Plot any known threats and their tactical ranges. Avoid threats to the maximum extent
possible by flying around them. If unable to avoid threats, use terrain masking to reduce the effective
range. If it's impossible to avoid the threat, request threat suppression or reevaluate the mission.

17.3.8. Weather Planning. On combat missions, there is no designated minimum ceiling and visibility
condition for low-level flight. The wind velocities encountered at low altitude over land are generally
light. However, because of surface friction, particularly in rugged terrain, these winds tend to be very
volatile.

17.3.8.1. Because of this inconsistency and for reasons of simplicity, low-level flight planning is
normally based on no-wind conditions.

17.3.8.2. In planning low-level missions over water, spin a wind corrected flight plan for greatest
accuracy. Overwater navigation depends entirely on DR and computer and/or GPS systems because of
the absence of checkpoints with which to establish fixes and to make course corrections.

17.4. Chart Selection. One of several charts may be appropriate for low altitude navigation. One chart
designed for low-level use is the Operational Navigation Chart (ONC). The 1:1,000,000 scale permits
identification of all visual and radar significant features and the chart has good cultural and relief
portrayal. For increased detail or slower speed aircraft, the Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC) (1:500,000) or
a Joint Operations Graphic (JOG) (1:250,000) may be used.

17.4.1. It is possible to mix navigation charts. The en route portion of the low-level mission can be
plotted on an ONC, while the TPC or JOG may be used for the target area or for specific identification
of checkpoints. If available, aerial photos are very useful for route study.

17.4.2. Annotate items of importance to navigation (turn points, descent points, high terrain, emergency
airfields, etc.) on the chart. Label preplanned fixes with planned radar range and bearing information. In
all cases, the annotations should be neat and compact for quick reference. Time is critical at high speed
and low altitude, so minimize the time you spend interpreting your chart in flight.

17.5. Planned Pacing. Choose suitable topographic or cultural returns for in-flight fixing and determine
a pacing schedule to accommodate these fixes. Plan the entire mission before takeoff. What you
accomplish in the air is merely a follow-through of what you have previously flight planned. Because
navigation demands flexibility, planning a pacing schedule involves two separate steps. First, complete a
premission plan based on expected in-flight conditions. Then, construct an alternate plan in case the
unexpected happens. For example, a 120-NM navigation leg, flown at 360, knots might accommodate
three radar fixes. This plan becomes the primary pacing schedule for the leg. A secondary pacing plan
might consider an unforeseen increase in GS and it would incorporate only two fixes. These principles
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                        349

apply to visual navigation as well as radar, but the fixes are generally closer together in visual
navigation.

17.6. Route Study. For a successful low-level mission, you must conduct a thorough route study. Route
study involves the entire crew, not just the navigator. In some missions, a pilot, loadmaster, flight
engineer, or boom operator can act as your map-reader, so they must know the same basic information
you know. Plan your en route updates during route study.

17.7. Radar Prediction. Radarscope interpretation can be preplanned for low-level flights. Note
significant returns, such as land-water contrast, unique terrain features, and towns. The time of year is
also important since radar returns during the winter may not appear the same as in other seasons of the
year.

17.7.1. At low altitudes, the appearance of a radar return changes rapidly as the aircraft approaches or
passes over the return. Often, the best identifying features of a checkpoint cannot be distinguished by
radar at low altitude. Because of this reduced radar range, the navigator should use DR procedures to
verify and identify radar returns.

17.7.2. No-return areas like lakes and rivers are better for radar prediction and navigation because they
furnish more accurate fixes than do towns or similar type returns. Constantly fine-tune your tilt and gain
settings; they are critical at low altitude. Use radar navigation in conjunction with an INS or GPS at low-
level for best effect.

17.8. Visual Prediction. In addition to the problems mentioned in radar prediction, other problems are
encountered with forecasting map-reading fixes. Weather effects, such as precipitation, smoke, haze, or
blowing dust, may obscure features intended for fixing. Visual navigation is especially difficult when
looking into the sun, particularly in hazy conditions. Avoid using cultural features for checkpoints
because they contain people and perhaps enemy forces, and during conflict should be avoided.

Section 17Câ€”Course Control

17.9. Maintaining Track. To meet controlled times of arrival and to avoid terrain hazards, attempt to
fly the low-level flight exactly as planned. Every low-level navigation leg is planned within a flight
corridor for safety-of-flight reasons. There are several ways to maintain course, each of which has
advantages and limitations. Some of the methods are described here.

17.9.1. Correction to a Point on Centerline. When radar is an available aid, use the manual cursor to
correct back to centerline. Locate a suitable target on centerline and determine the intercept return to
centerline. The intercept correction (degrees of heading change) is an arbitrary determination based
primarily on the distance of the target from the aircraft. The closer the target is, the larger the correction
will be. However, heading corrections should normally not exceed 45o. Move the manual cursor to the
desired intercept angle on the side of the scope opposite the target from 360o and turn the aircraft an
equal number of degrees toward the radar return. When the target falls under the repositioned manual
cursor, the aircraft has returned to centerline and the heading correction should be taken out. Example:
Aircraft 3 NM right of course, target found 15 NM down course, 45o intercept. Move manual cursor 45o
right (045 bearing), turn aircraft 45o left (3l5o heading). When target is under repositioned cursor, the
aircraft has returned to centerline and heading correction should be taken out.
350                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

17.9.2. 30o Intercept Method. The 30o intercept method can be used when no target is available on
course line but the relative aircraft position left or right of course is known. The steps involved to
intercept course are:

17.9.2.1. Parallel course.

17.9.2.2. Determine the distance the aircraft is left or right of course and double the distance.

17.9.2.3. Determine the time needed to fly the doubled distance by using current GS.

17.9.2.4. Turn 30o in the direction back to centerline.

17.9.2.5. When time has elapsed, turn to desired magnetic course (MC) and kill the drift.

EXAMPLE: Aircraft 3 NM right, GS 360 knots, magnetic heading (MH) 270o. Turn to 240o and hold
correction for 1 minute. After 1 minute has elapsed, return to MH 270o.

17.9.3. Off-Course Correction Tables. Off-course corrections can also be determined by using the
table shown in Figure 17.1. Enter from the top of the table with the miles-off-course, go vertically to the
line representing miles flown, and read the correction to intercept. You must be paralleling course to use
this table.

17.9.4. Correction to Intercept Course. The graph shown in Figure 17.2 is used when it is necessary to
intercept course rather than converge at the turn point. To use this graph, the entering arguments are NM
off course and GS. The table can be used for fixed alterations of 15o, 30o, or 45o. Enter the graph on the
left with NM off course; go horizontally across the chart to the line representing GS. Then, go vertically
to the top or bottom (depending on the desired degrees to alter) to read the time required to intercept
course. After altering the indicated time has elapsed, correct back to the original heading to maintain
desired course.

17.10. Sixty-to-One Correction. One degree of latitude, measured along a meridian, is equal to 60 NM
and 1 minute of arc is equal to 1 NM. If you're 60 NM from the next turn point, 1 NM off course and
paralleling course (drift killed); a 1o turn toward centerline will put the aircraft over the turn point. Most
of the time you will be less than 60 NM from the turn point; therefore, divide 60 by the distance to go to
the next turn point, then multiply by the number of NM off course. For example, if 30 NM from the turn
point and 3 NM left of course, take 60/30 X 3 to get a 6o required correction. Apply the 6o to the desired
MC and kill the drift for a good heading to correct back to the turn point.

17.11. Ten, Twenty, or Thirty Degree Correction Technique. This course correction technique is
used when 3 NM or less off course. It uses 10o, 20o, or 30o heading corrections back to centerline,
depending on your distance off course. Begin by paralleling course. Second, determine the distance left
or right of course. Third, multiply the number of NM off course by 10 to determine the number of
degrees to turn toward centerline. Fourth, hold the correction for 6 NM of travel (example, 300 knots GS
1:12, 360 knots GS 1 minute). At the end of the time, turn back to MC and kill the drift.

Section 17Dâ€”Time Control

17.12. Time Control. Positive time control of aircraft flying low-level missions is imperative. Each
sortie is assigned a specific time to arrive at each designated turn point and over the target zone. Failure
to meet your ETA precisely can result in aborted missions or two aircraft occupying the same airspace
simultaneously (very bad). Annotate route legs on the chart with a series of small time ticks drawn
across the leg. Space these time ticks 1 minute apart according to forecast GS; for example, 6 NM apart
for a planned GS of 360 knots. Time ticks begin at the low-level entry (starting) point and continue
through the entire route to the target. With these time ticks, you can check the time over each tick and
keep a running account of whether the aircraft is ahead of or behind the required time schedule.

17.13. Methods of Time Control. If you need to change GS, use an established method to make this
change accurately and quickly. Six methods are presented in the following paragraphs. These are not the
only accepted methods but are some of the easier methods to use. As with most time corrections, these
methods are based on flight planned GS.

17.13.1. Proportional Method. The proportional method can be used either high or low-level. Begin by
determining the number of seconds early or late. Next, increase or decrease flight planned GS by that
increment (20 seconds = 20 knots). Hold this correction for the following length of time: flight planned
GS/60 minutes (360 knots/60 = 6 minutes).
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     353

EXAMPLE: You are 30 seconds late and your flight planned GS is 420 knots. Increase flight planned
GS (420 knots) by 30 knots (450 knots) and hold it for 7 minutes.

17.13.2. Total Time and/or Total Distance. This method is normally used at high-level but also applies
to low-level. Check the distance to your next checkpoint and compare current Zulu time with desired
Zulu time at the next checkpoint. This will give you a time and distance to go. Set up a ratio on the MB-
4 computer by putting the desired time to go over the distance to go and look above the rate index for
the required GS.

EXAMPLE: Current Zulu time is 1100:00 and distance to go is 140 NM. Desired ETA at the next
checkpoint is 1120:00. You must fly 140 NM in 20 minutes or 420 knots GS (140 NM/20 minutes = 420
knots GS/rate index).

17.13.3. Turn Point Method. During mission planning, a correction factor can be calculated for each
low-level leg. This is done by multiplying each low-level leg time by the appropriate coefficient (Figure
17.3). The correction factor calculated for each leg equals the number of seconds gained or lost for each
10 knots of speed change from flight planned GS over the entire leg.

EXAMPLE: Leg time is 7 minutes, 42 seconds. Flight planned GS is 420 knots. Coefficient extracted
from Figure 17.3 is 1.5. Multiply leg time by coefficient factor (7:42 x 1.5) to equal approximate
correction factor of 12. You are 36 seconds late at your last turn point (based on Zulu time). You will
gain 12 seconds over the length of the low-level leg for each 10 knots increase in flight planned GS.
Therefore, an increase in flight planned GS of 30 knots to 450 knots will gain 36 seconds if 450 knots is
held for the entire leg.


Figure 17.3. Coefficient Table.




17.13.4. Six Minutes Out Method. To use this method, determine the distance remaining to a
checkpoint 6 minutes prior to the time required over the turn point. Multiply this distance by 10 to get
required GS to fly to turn point, starting 6 minutes out.

EXAMPLE: Required time at checkpoint is 1413:27. Six minutes before (1407:27) you are 38.5 NM
from the turn point. A GS of 385 knots at 1407:27 will put you at the checkpoint on time.

17.13.5. Ten Percent Method. Determine the amount of time to gain or lose. Adjust your GS to 10
percent above (if late) or below (if early) of the flight-planned GS (10% x 300 knots = 30 knots). The
rule states that holding the 10 percent increase or decrease of flight-planned GS for 10 minutes will gain
354                                                                AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001

or lose 1 minute. This also means that one can gain or lose 6 seconds for every minute the adjustment is
maintained. To apply this method, determine the 10-percent factor during mission planning.

EXAMPLE: In flight, you determine you are 35 seconds late. Your flight-planned GS is 300 knots. You
should increase your GS by 30 knots (to 330 knots) and hold it for 6 minutes. This will make up 36
seconds.

17.13.6. Incremental Method. To determine the increment, you must find your miles per minute (300
knots = 5 miles per minute). Multiply that by 10 to obtain the increment (5 X 10 = 50 knots). Determine
time ahead or behind in seconds. Divide this time by 10 to obtain the number of minutes to hold the
correction. The rule of thumb states that if the increment is held for 1 minute, you will gain or lose 10
seconds.

EXAMPLE: You are 90 seconds late and your flight-planned GS is 300 knots. The increment is 50
knots. Increase flight-planned GS (300 knots) by 50 knots (350 knots) and hold it for 9 minutes.

NOTE: Remember that most methods are based on flight-planned GS. Apply the correction to the flight-
planned GS, not the current GS.

17.14. Summary. The most important phase of the low-level mission is flight planning. If the mission is
planned well and there is good crew coordination, mission success is greatly enhanced. Consequently,
you should (1) know what aids will be available, (2) be familiar with all phases of the particular mission
and study them until a clear mental picture of the flight emerges and finally, (3) maintain good, reliable
in-flight DR procedures. If you do all this, the low-level mission will be greatly simplified. If not, the
chances of success are greatly reduced.

                                         AERIAL DELIVERY

Section 18Aâ€”Introduction

18.1. Basics. Placing a bomb on the target or aerial delivery of troops and supplies require many of the
same techniques. Timing on aerial delivery missions is critical and precise arrival over the target or drop
zone must be carefully planned and executed. The low altitude portion of the mission can be used to
update ballistics for the bomb release point (BRP) or computed air release point (CARP) information.

18.1.1. Finding the BRP and finding the CARP require similar data and computations. Both points
require simultaneous solving of four different problems: target ID, time control, track control, and
determining the release point. Locating the proper release point in space is a simple airplot problem.
Any object dropped from an aircraft is affected by certain factors including aircraft airspeed, altitude
above the target, air resistance on the dropped object, and wind effect.

18.1.2. Navigation computers greatly simplify locating the release point. However, you must carefully
control all inputs to the computer since any input error will affect delivery accuracy. So remember if you
put garbage in your computer, you will get garbage out.

Section 18Bâ€”The Bombing Problem

18.2. Basics. Precision bombing is the heart of the bombardier's profession. Success as a bombardier is
measured in feet and seconds, and often in fractions of seconds. The bombing problem is
mathematically resolved in a bombing computer to solve for what is technically termed the bomb
resolver locus (BRL). The aircraft must be flown to the BRL to reach the bomb release point (BRP). The
BRP is located upwind of the target along the computed BRP. The BRL is constantly changing
throughout the bomb run to compensate for many factors including wind, altitude, airspeed, aiming
updates, heading, and other factors which affect the bombing solution. You should know the elements of
the basic bombing problem to understand the solution. These elements can be viewed in two planes,
horizontally and vertically, solved simultaneously.

18.2.1. Horizontal Problem (Figure 18.1). The horizontal problem is concerned with establishing
heading to the BRL. To determine the release heading, the bombing computer must be able to locate the
target to determine wind effect on the bomb. By placing the crosshairs (electronically generated signal
on the radarscope) on a radar return, the operator identifies the target for the computer. By resolving for
wind effect or wind to impact (WTI) on the bomb against time remaining to impact (TI), the computer
provides release heading and range to the BRL. For simplicity, the BRL is an air position and the BRP is
a ground position. The air leg consists of a true heading and air distance to release, and the wind leg is
wind effect on the aircraft. Although constantly changing, the BRL is the point at which the crew must
aim the aircraft in order to reach the BRP.
356                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

Figure 18.1. Horizontal Bombing Problem.




18.2.2. Vertical Problem (Figure 18.2). The vertical problem is concerned with establishing the time of
release. Time to go (TTG) is the time remaining until the bombs are released. To determine the exact
time of release, you must know two elements: how long the weapon will be in the air from release until
impact (time of fall or TF), and trail (L), distance the aircraft travels past the target before bomb
detonation or impact. Released too soon, the bomb falls short; released too late, the bomb falls beyond
the target. The TF and trail are taken from ballistics tables and set into the computer. Because the shape,
size, and drag of bombs vary greatly, separate tables are used for each type bomb. The virtual impact
point (VIP) is the position of the aircraft at the moment of impact or detonation, providing the aircraft
stays on heading after release. The system computes the time remaining to impact when the crosshairs
are placed on the target. The formula is TG = (distance to target + L)/GS - TF.

18.2.2.1. On a typical bomb run, the bombardier places the crosshairs on the aiming point and sets the
bombing computer into operation. The pilot centers the directional indicator aligning the aircraft on the
computed heading for release, and may give the bombardier steering control of the aircraft by way of an
auto pilot hookup. The bombardier checks true airspeed and altitude to assure that the ballistic settings
are still correct. At a precomputed range the timing meter will start; this provides the countdown to
bomb release.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     357

Figure 18.2. Vertical Bombing Problem.




18.2.2.2. While it appears only a matter of keeping the crosshairs on the aiming plot, the bombardier is
actually furnishing the bombing computer with all the inputs needed to solve the bombing problem. A
few seconds prior to "bombs away," the bomb bay doors open; at "bombs away," a signal is sent to the
release circuits and the weapons are dropped. After bomb release, the pilot again takes over aircraft
steering. Whether a B-52 or an F-15E delivers the bomb, the principles are the same and the bombing
problem is solved in a similar manner by computers.

Section 18Câ€”Computed Air Release Point

18.3. Basics. The computed air release point system is the standard tactical drop system for personnel
and equipment. Commonly referred to as a CARP, it is a scientific approach to a parachute-bombing
problem. The mathematical CARP solution is based on average parachute ballistics and fundamental
dead reckoning principles.

18.3.1. The aircraft commander is responsible for insuring the CARP solution is computed and used in
all parachute operations not using a ground-marked or electronic release point. In reality, the navigator
is responsible for the actual solution of the CARP (Figure 18.3).

18.3.2. In flight, the pilot and navigator jointly confirm the offset distance for the CARP. The pilot
assumes the responsibility for maintaining the offset distance and required track. The navigator picks the
timing point (if used), controls the time to release, and continually crosschecks the offset distance.
Cooperation and teamwork among the crew are crucial to airdrop success.

Figure 18.3. Completed CARP.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                    359

18.4. Governing Factors. The CARP computes the release point of the first parachute-supported object.
The actual ground pattern of the remaining airdropped personnel or equipment depends upon:

18.4.1. Time between "Green Light" and the time of last exit.

18.4.2. Aircraft stability from "Green Light" throughout the jump or extraction period.

18.4.3. Uniformity of loads or parachute types within elements.

18.4.4. Glide angle of individual parachutes.

18.4.5. Aircraft track across the drop zone.

18.4.6. Aircraft altitude and speed.

18.4.7. Weather, primarily winds.

18.5. Initial Point (IP). The initial point should be a prominent yet a relatively small checkpoint, and
should be located a sufficient distance from the drop zone to allow slowdown to drop airspeed,
performance of slowdown maneuvers, and for any respacing of formation that might be required. The IP
should be located as close as possible to the axis of the drop zone (DZ).

18.6. Release Point. The location of the release point is critical to the accuracy of the drop and can be
determined in several ways. Drop accuracy is measured in yards, not miles. Since it is difficult to
precisely position the aircraft over a point due to limited downward visibility, timing points or other
means are often used to determine the release point. When the computed air release point falls abeam a
small, easily recognizable checkpoint, a timing point is unnecessary.

18.6.1. Visual. The simplest method for accurate airdrops is to locate a small, precise landmark that the
crew can easily find. Depending on the location of the CARP, "Green Light" can be called as the aircraft
comes abeam this point, or the navigator can begin timing to reach the release point. Generally, a timing
point close to the CARP will be more accurate than one far away. This technique can be used during the
day, at night under natural illumination, or using night vision goggles.

18.6.2. Sight Angle Drop (SAD). SAD was developed in response to the need for a visual drop without
having detailed photos of the drop zone environment. Sight angle is based on trigonometry, and is based
on looking at the point-of-impact (PI) through the front windscreen at a known angle. Knowing the
altitude of PI and aircraft deck angle and using tabular data, the navigator can extract the distance at
which the PI will disappear under the nose of the aircraft. When it does, the navigator begins timing to
the release point. The accuracy of this type of drop depends highly on a stable airspeed and altitude
during the timing period.

18.6.3. Computer. Another way to locate the CARP is to use highly accurate navigation computers.
Either GPS or INS, assisted by ground-based signals, is both reliable and accurate enough to drop
personnel and equipment, and does not rely on VFR conditions to drop.

18.6.4. Electronic. Electronic means is another method to determine the release point. One way uses a
ground-based radar beacon to mark the release point. The navigator directs the aircraft to the beacon
360                                                                  AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

using the radar, and times to the release point using the radar range marks. The long distance flown
while timing (typically 1-2 nautical miles) keeps this type of drop from being pinpoint accurate. Another
uses a beacon that interfaces with the aircraft's navigation computer and can automatically steer to the
CARP and release the load.

18.6.4.1. Weather Aerial Delivery System (AWADS). The adverse Weather Aerial Delivery System
(AWADS) can also be used. This system allows on-board radar updates to the computer, which is then
used to guide the aircraft to the CARP. Finally, more and more aircraft are being equipped with GPS
which can provide very accurate navigation to the CARP.

18.6.4.2. Station Keeping Equipment (SKE). You can also locate the release point using information
transmitted from another aircraft. In an IFR airdrop formation, the lead aircraft uses one of the above
methods to locate the release point. SKE-equipped follower aircraft time from signals transmitted by
lead to locate their respective release points.

18.7. Parachute Ballistics. The ballistics of different types of parachutes varies greatly. Each parachute
is designed for a specific purpose and has its own peculiar characteristics. The parachute ballistics used
in the solution of the CARP, for forward travel time and vertical distances, are averages that are accurate
enough to use on airdrops. One important characteristic of parachutes that cannot be computed in the
CARP solution is the gliding characteristics of each parachute. A parachute glides in random directions
during its descent and these directions tend to cancel out. If this were not the case, it would be extremely
difficult to obtain the desired accuracy, even if other variables (such as wind effect and aircraft
positioning) were negligible. For example, the T-10 parachute has a gliding angle of 18 degrees from the
vertical. This gliding effect is what makes parachutes appear to drift under no-wind conditions.

18.8. Components:

18.8.1. Vertical Distance. The distance, in feet, a load falls after exiting the aircraft and prior to
stabilization (Figure 18.4).

18.8.2. Rate of Fall. The rate of fall is the vertical velocity, in feet per second, of the airdropped load
while under full parachute canopy. Rate of fall is corrected to a standard day sea-level rate when
corrected for air density.

18.8.3. Time of Fall Constant (TFC). A constant in seconds computed during airdrop tests that
compensates for the nonlinear rate of fall from load exit to stabilization. This factor is used to determine
drift effect during stabilization (TFC = ST â€“ DQ).

18.8.4. Forward Travel Time. Exit time plus deceleration quotient. A time constant that compensates
for the horizontal distance the object travels from the green light signal until reaching stabilization. This
factor is used to compute FTD.
AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001                                                                        361

Figure 18.4. Horizontal View of the CARP.




18.8.5. Forward Travel Distance (FTD). The ground distance traveled by the airdropped load from the
green light signal to stabilization. Plot FTD back from the point-of-impact (PI) along DZ axis. Convert
the forward travel time in seconds to forward travel distance in yards (or meters) on the MB-4 using this
formula:




18.8.6. Drift Effect. Drift effect is the distance the parachute and load drift during the total time of fall.
This effect depends upon the total time of fall of the parachute load and the wind velocity. Compute drift
effect using the following procedures:

18.8.6.1. Find the time of fall by dividing the deployment altitude by the adjusted rate of fall to find the
number of seconds required for the parachute to descend from time of full deployment to the ground.
The parachute starts to drift as soon as it leaves the aircraft. Therefore, you should add the time of fall
constant to the time of fall to determine the total time of fall that is the number of seconds the load is
falling free of the aircraft and is affected by the wind.

18.8.6.2. Then multiply the total time of fall by the wind velocity to find the drift effect. The formula is:




18.8.7. Plotting CARP. The forward travel distance and drift effect have been discussed in the sequence
in which they occur; however, the CARP is plotted as follows:
362                                                                  AFPAM11-216     1 MARCH 2001

18.8.7.1. Starting from the point of impact, plot the drift effect upwind.

18.8.7.2. Plot the forward travel distance back along the DZ axis from the end of the wind vector. The
end of the forward travel vector is the CARP location (Figure 18.5).


Figure 18.5. CARP and DZ Diagram.




18.9. Summary. Bombing and airdropping use the same physical principles to accomplish the mission.
Both rely on a mathematical computation to determine the effect of wind and gravity on the bomb or
airdrop item. After compensating for that effect to locate the release point, both require pinpoint
accuracy and split-second timing to properly execute the mission.

                                             AIR REFUELING

Section 19Aâ€”Introduction

19.1. Basics. Global air refueling is the primary means of extending US air power worldwide. The
decrease in operating bases on foreign soil and the application of aircraft for roles in command and
control, logistics, and long range reconnaissance has expanded the role of air refueling to support all Air
Force missions. Although tankers still support the Single Integrated Operations Plan (SIOP) missions,
they are also called upon to provide support to a wide range of operations that include most of the US
Air Force's aircraft and some friendly foreign aircraft as well. The information contained in this section
is general and nondirective in nature. Consult specific command directives if planning aerial refueling
operations.

19.2. Mission Planning. It is very helpful to coordinate information between receiver and tanker
aircrews while mission planning. For operational missions, do not compromise security by discussing
sensitive or classified information through unsecured media. When it is feasible to communicate before
flight on training missions, tanker and receiver crews should confirm basic scheduling information and
discuss pertinent details of the mission. Pre-flight communication often clears up problems that could
cause confusion, possibly resulting in a dangerous situation while airborne. Discuss or confirm the
following items prior to flight when practical:

19.2.1. Takeoff times and locations.

19.2.2. Call signs and number of aircraft.

19.2.3. Routing to the air refueling.

19.2.4. Type of rendezvous.

19.2.5. Timing considerations.

19.2.6. Refueling altitude and track.

19.2.7. Amount of fuel to be transferred.

19.2.8. Training requirements.

19.2.9. End of air refueling routing or altitude.

19.2.10. Formation procedures.

19.2.11. Radio frequencies/equipment settings.

19.2.12. MARSA procedures.
364                                                                AFPAM11-216           1 MARCH 2001

NOTE: When air refueling control points (ARCP) are located above 60o north or below 60o south
latitude, polar navigation (USAF Grid) may be required. Grid courses may vary significantly from one
type projection to another.

Section 19Bâ€”Communication

19.3. Basics. During air refueling operations, communication between tanker and receiver crews must
be a highly coordinated effort. Tankers and receivers communicate over a dedicated refueling frequency.
Voice transmissions on that frequency should be concise and kept to an absolute minimum. Any
unnecessary transmissions could provide useful information to the enemy in a hostile environment.
Receiver and tanker crews should use standard radio calls and terminology to minimize confusion.

Section 19Câ€”Refueling Tracks

19.4. Basics. Air refueling tracks are published in FLIP AP/1B. This publication contains geographic
coordinates, air refueling frequencies, altitudes, rendezvous equipment settings, and specific notes.
Rules governing air refueling can be found in Federal Aviation Regulations. There are two basic types
of tracks: linear tracks and anchor tracks. Occasionally, a random, unpublished track is used to meet
specific mission requirements.

19.4.1. A linear track (see Figure 19.1) begins at the air refueling initial point (ARIP), continues to the
air refueling control point (ARCP), and follows a series of navigation check points to the end air
refueling exit (AREX) point. This type of track is not necessarily a straight line, and may be comprised
of a series of straight segments with turns along the published route. After a rendezvous on a straight
track, aircraft are expected to remain as close to the published course as possible.


Figure 19.1. Typical Linear Air Refueling Track.




19.4.2. An anchor track (see Figure 19.2) consists of a series of points arranged in a racetrack pattern
within a prescribed boundary. The boundary is typically rectangular, but can be any size or shape. An
anchor point is designated for tanker orbit. Receiver aircraft enter at the ARIP or a designated entry
point when published. Aircraft must remain within the published boundaries during air refueling.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                      365

Figure 19.2. Typical Anchor Refueling Track.




Section 19Dâ€”Rendezvous Procedures

19.5. Basics. There are three basic types of rendezvous: en route, point parallel, and radar controller
directed. In all three types the tanker is positioned at a base refueling altitude and the highest receiver
aircraft is at least a thousand feet below the tanker. To preclude an altitude conflict, confirm altitudes
with receiver or tanker prior to rendezvous. Regardless of the type of rendezvous, the purpose is to get
the tanker and receiver aircraft joined up at the air refueling control time (ARCT). For point parallel and
en route rendezvous, the tanker is responsible for receiver navigation from ARCP until the AREX point.
For the radar controller directed rendezvous, responsibility for the rendezvous depends on the situation.
Altitude separation between tankers and receivers is critical during the rendevous procedures.

19.5.1. En Route Rendezvous. The en route rendezvous is simple, but requires precise time control by
both the tanker and receiver to arrive over the rendezvous point at the same time. There is no designated
orbit point on track for an en route rendezvous, therefore you must use course and speed control to make
the rendezvous control time. The designated rendezvous point is normally the published ARIP.

19.5.2. Point Parallel Rendezvous. The point parallel has a designated tanker orbit point at the ARCP
(see Figure 19.3). When cleared to delay at the ARCP, the tanker sets up a left hand racetrack orbit
pattern, remaining within an area 60 NM long by 25 NM wide (see Figure 19.4). The receiver enters the
track at the ARIP and continues downtrack to the ARCP. It is imperative that the receiver be on course
and airspeed to the ARCP for a successful rendezvous. If all applicable ARTCC clearances have been
obtained, the tanker will turn toward the receiver, establish proper track offset, and continue toward the
ARIP. To effect the rendezvous, the 25 NM wide area extends down to the ARIP when cleared for air
refueling. When reaching the appropriate turn range (nose-to-nose distance), the tanker begins a 30
degree bank left turn to roll out in a position allowing the receiver to maneuver for air refueling. The
primary means to determine range between aircraft is the air-to-air TACAN. Be prepared to use other
means to accomplish the rendezvous should the primary equipment fail.

Figure 19.4. Point Parallel Rendezvous Tanker Orbit Area.




19.5.3. Radar Controller Directed Rendezvous. This type of rendezvous is typical for fighter type
aircraft refueling in an anchor area where the airspace is controlled by ground or air military radar. The
rendezvous can be accomplished several ways. For instance, the controller may assume responsibility
for the rendezvous and provide vectors to get the aircraft joined up. In other cases, the controller gives
the tanker or receiver responsibility for the rendezvous. If the tanker is responsible for the rendezvous, it
is typically a point parallel with an orbit at the anchor point. If the receiver is responsible for the
rendezvous, they maneuver from a nose-to-nose aspect while the tanker maintains a constant heading.
This is called a fighter turn-on. The radar controller-directed rendezvous often involve multiple sets of
fighter receivers arriving at different times. All participants must pay close attention to aircraft location
and altitude for potential conflicts. Although the radar controller owns the airspace, aircrews are still
responsible for monitoring navigation and maintaining aircraft separation while in the refueling area.
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                     367

19.6. Weather. During rendezvous closure, bad weather or low visibility can increase the potential of a
failed rendezvous or receiver overrun. The effects of sun glare, cloud formations, precipitation, and
various other weather phenomena can cause loss of visual contact. The receiver navigator will use radar
to identify the tanker but will have no visual backup from the pilots in these circumstances. Successful
completion of the rendezvous will depend on the ability of the receiver navigator to direct closure to 1/2
NM. During refueling, adverse weather can lead to a dangerous situation. The tanker navigator must
make a concerted effort to maneuver away from these areas by altering course, or altitude, or moving to
another air refueling track. The best time to avoid adverse weather begins during mission planning.
Unfortunately, after several replanning attempts, you may still encounter severe weather.

19.7. Summary. Successful air refueling requires a coordinated effort between tanker and receiver flight
crews beginning with mission planning. Crews must use standard procedures and terminology to
communicate essential information. Air refueling tracks come in a variety of shapes and sizes; therefore
flight crews must study FLIP to determine specific track requirements. There are several types of
rendezvous demanding unique responsibilities of the tanker and receivers. Although the rendezvous is
important, crews must always remain aware of environmental conditions and human factors that could
jeopardize safety.

NOTE: Temperature Rise is generally +1 degree for most aircraft

or True Air Speed = 39 * MACH * sq rt (True Air Temperature)

or Minutes for Complete 360 = .0055 * True Air Speed / tan (Bank Angle)

GForce = 1 / cos (Bank Angle)

A2.7. Celestial Precomputations:

Variables:
LAT = Latitude of Assumed Position or DR LONG = Longitude of Assumed Position or DR
Zn = True Azimuth                        Z = Azimuth Angle
Hc = Height Computed                     DEC = Declination of the Body from Air Almanac
SHA = Sidereal Hour Angle
LHA = Local Hour Angle = GHA â€“W (+E) Long + SHA + corrections

NOTE: Hc and Z will be displayed in degrees and decimal degrees. You must convert the decimal
degrees to minutes. Once the azimuth angle (Z) has been determined by computation, the ambiguity
caused by LAT and LHA can be resolved by the following:

Zn = Z       sin (LHA)<0
Zn = 360 â€“ Z sin (LHA)>0




or Height Computed (Hc) = asin ( sin (DR Latitude) * sin (Body_Declination) + cos(LHA) *

MOTIONS:

The formula for combined 1â€“minute motion can be separated as follows:

or Motion of Body = 15 (cos (LAT)(sin Zn)
or Motion of the Body (for 1 minute) = 15 * cos (Latitude) * sin (Azimuth)




or Motion of the observer (for 1 minute) = (Ground Speed / 60) * cos (True Course â€“ Azimuth)

These quantities, whether combined or used separately, must be added algebraically to the Ho and
subtracted from the Hc. To apply Coriolis/rhumb line correction to Ho, multiply Coriolis/rhumb line by
sin (ZNâ€“TC). Note that P and N adjustments are not necessary with these computer applications since
Hc is correct for fix time, not Pub. No. 249 EPOCH year time.




or Motion of the Body (for 1 minute) = 15 * cos (Latitude) * sin (Azimuth) â€“
                                     (cos (True Course â€“ Azimuth) * Ground Speed / 60)




or Motion of the Body (for 1 minute) = 15 * cos (Latitude) * cos (270â€“Azimuth) â€“
                                     (cos (True Course â€“ Azimuth) * Ground Speed / 60)




or Rhumb Line = 0.146 * (Ground Speed /100)^2 * sin (True Course) * tan (Latitude)


or Coriolis = 0.02625 * Ground Speed * sin (Latitude)


or Coriolis = cos (90 â€“ True Course â€“ Azimuth) * 0.02625 * Ground Speed * sin (Latitude)

For combined Coriolis/rhumb line adjustment to assumed position, use:




or Coriolis = 0.02625 * Ground Speed * sin (Latitude) +
                [0.146 * (Ground Speed /100)^2 * sin (True Course) * tan(Latitude)]

GS = Groundspeed                                     TC = True Course




Distance=60 * acos ((sin (Departure Latitude) * sin (Destination Latitude))+(cos (Departure Latitude) *
                      cos (Destination Latitude) * cos (Destination Longitude â€“ Departure Longitude) ))




or Heading Angle = acos ((sin (Destination Latitude) â€“ sin (Departure Latitude) * cos (Distance /60) ) /
              (sin (Distance /60) * cos (Departure Latitude)))

Hi = H                        sin (Î» 2 â€“ Î»1 ) < 0
Hi = 360â€“H                    sin (Î» 2 â€“ Î»1 ) > 0

This formula computes the latitude of Li where Î»i intersects the great circle defined by (L1, Î»1) and (L2,
Î» 2). This formula can be very useful when matching charts of different projections or scales.




or Intermediate Latitude = atan ( ( tan (Destination Latitude) * sin (Intermediate Longitude â€“

or DEST Longitude = Departure Longitude â€“ ( (Elapsed Time * Ground Speed * sin (True Course) ) /
                    (60 * cos (Departure Latitude) ) )

Otherwise:

             Ln (tan (45 + 0.5 * Destination Latitude)) â€“ Ln (tan (45 + 0.5 * Departure Latitude) )

NOTE: The flight path may not cross either pole.

For long distances, use formula below:
DR Latitude = 90.0 â€“ acos (sin ( â€“ Departure Latitude) * cos (Distance/60.0) +
               cos ( â€“ Departure Latitude) * sin (Distance /60.0) * cos (True Course))
DR Longitude = Departure Longitude +/â€“ acos ( (cos (Distance /60.0 ) â€“sin ( â€“ DR Latitude) *
               sin ( â€“ Departure Latitude)) / (cos ( â€“ DR Latitude) * cos ( â€“ Departure Latitude)))
NOTE: Distance can be replaced with (Ground Speed * Elapsed Time) where Elapsed Time is in hours

                      â€“ Ln (tan(45 + 0.5 * Departure Latitude) ) )

                              C=0

or Distance = 60 * (Destination Longitude â€“ Departure Longitude) * cos (Departure Latitude)




or Distance = 60 * (Destination Latitude â€“ Departure Latitude) * cos (Rhumb line True Course)
AFPAM11-216          1 MARCH 2001                                                                  397

A2.11. Course Correction to Destination:

Variables:

Required Magnetic Course = Intended Magnetic Course + asin (Distance Off Course/Distance To Go)




or Distance To Checkpoint = sq rt (Distance Flown^2 â€“ Distance Off Course^2)




or Distance To Go = sq rt ( (Total Distance â€“ Distance Flown)^2 + Distance Off Course^2 )

A2.12. Point to Point:

Variables:
D1 = DME #1                                       D2 = DME #2
R1 = Radial #1                                    R2 = Radial #2
HA = Altitude MSL                                 HT = Elevation of the TACAN
T = Time between positions                        A = Altitude above TACAN (in NM)

       Target Altitude MSL) / 6076) ^2 ) â€“ 2 * sq rt ( First DME^2 â€“ ( ( (Aircraft Altitude MSL â€“
       Target Altitude MSL) / 6076) ^2 ) ) * sq rt ( Second DME^2 â€“ ( ( (Aircraft Altitude MSL â€“
       Target Altitude MSL) / 6076) ^2 ) ) * cos ( First Radial â€“ Second Radial) ) / Elapsed Time

NOTE: If you do not divide by Elapsed Time, the result is Distance instead of Ground Speed




or Magnetic Course Flown = Second Radial â€“ asin ( ( First DME * sin (First Radial â€“ Second Radial) ) /
                           (Ground Speed * Elapsed Time) )

NOTES:
1. This assumes that the magnetic variation of the TACAN is the same as the one affecting the aircraft
over the distance flown.
2. This assumes that if using a RADAR target, the radials are taken as magnetic readings (or converted
to magnetic)

A2.13. Rate of Climb:

TAS = True Airspeed
ROC = Rate of climb in feet/min
D = Ground distance over which the altitude change (âˆ† Alt) occurs
