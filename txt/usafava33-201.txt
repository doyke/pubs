INFOCON presents a structured, coordinated approach to defend against and
react to adversarial attacks on DoD computer/telecommunication systems and
networks. INFOCON levels are as follows:
INFOCON 5: Routine NetOps: Normal readiness of information systems
and networks that can be sustained indefinitely.
                                                                             Was the file or email forwarded: if so to whom?
INFOCON 4: Increased Vigilance: In preparation for operations or
  exercises, with a limited impact to the end user.

INFOCON 3: Enhanced Readiness: Increases the frequency of
  validation of information networks and its corresponding
  configuration. Impact to end user is minor.

INFOCON 2: Greater Readiness: Increases the frequency of
  validation of information networks and its corresponding
  configuration. Impact to administrators will increase and impact to
  end user could be significant.

INFOCON 1: Maximum Readiness: Addresses intrusion techniques that
  cannot be identified or defeated at lower readiness levels. Only
  implemented in limited cases. Could be significant impact on
  administrators and end users.
