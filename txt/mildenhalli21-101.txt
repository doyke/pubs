     times until the composite material is removed from the site. Bioenvironmental will
     determine required PPE during the recovery process.
     3.2.3. In the event of a different MDS incident/accident where the potential for
     hazardous material exposure exists, CDDAR operations will not begin until the owning
     organization provides guidance for personnel and equipment to properly handle the
     hazards. NOTE: RAF Lakenheath’s 48th Civil Engineer Squadron Explosive Ordinance
     Disposal Team provides support to clear explosives loaded aircraft as required before
     CDDAR operations begin.
4. CDDAR PROCEDURES:
  4.1. The CDDAR Team will consist of 100 MXS personnel from the R&R Section, assisted
  by personnel from applicable aircraft maintenance units. Upon notification of an
  incident/accident from MOC, R&R Section will mobilize general and/or C-135 series aircraft
  crash recovery equipment and stand by for dispatch to the crash site when requested by the
  OSC. If an incident occurs during normal duty hours, the shift supervisor will assemble the
  crash team. If the incident requires more personnel, a shop recall will be initiated. After
  normal duty hours, the R&R technician on standby will initiate a recall of required personnel.
     4.1.1. In accordance with (IAW) 100 ARW Plan 91-204, Mishap Response, off-base
     incidents are considered crime scenes under law. The local Constabulary has jurisdiction
     over any incident/accident occurring off base. Off base response will be accomplished in
     coordination with the RAF Mildenhall Station Commander and will be fully supported by
     100 MXS CDDAR Team.
  4.2. Once a CDDAR team has been established, the Team Chief will assess the situation and
  begin organizing the required crash recovery equipment. Transportation of equipment to the
  site will be requested through the OSC. The Team Chief will report immediately to the OSC
  for instructions.
  4.3. If the aircraft is disabled on the runway/taxiway and time permits, the OSC will direct
  routine runway clearance operations. If immediate removal is required, the OSC may direct
  urgent clearance operations IAW 100 ARW Plan 91-204. When the aircraft is not on the
  runway and does not pose a danger to inbound aircraft, routine operations will apply. Under
  this condition, removal actions are taken to minimize damage to aircraft/equipment and to
  minimize danger to personnel.
  4.4. Blown tires: Upon notification of a blown tire from MOC, the owning organization’s
  Production Supervisor will immediately report to the OSC. Blown tires should be handled
  IAW Technical Order (TO) 4B-1-1, Use of Landing Gear Wheel Brakes and Wheels During
  Ground Operations. The owning organization is responsible for removing the aircraft from
  the disabled location. The 100 MXS R&R Section will report to the on-scene Production
  Supervisor to assist as needed in the event normal tire change procedures are not possible.
  4.5. Hot brakes: Hot brakes will be handled IAW Mildenhall Instruction (MILDI) 13-201,
  Airfield and Air Traffic Control Operations by the aircraft owning organization. A CDDAR
  Team will be assembled and dispatched only if emergency runway/taxiway clearing is
  required. Procedures for handling hot brakes are outlined in TO 4B-1-1.

    4.6. Barrier engagements: Barrier engagements will be handled IAW MILDI 13-201. A
    CDDAR Team will be assembled and dispatched only if emergency runway/taxiway clearing
    is required.
    4.7. Gear up landing: CV-22 gear up landing equipment will be stored/inspected by owning
    organization. Upon an In Flight Emergency notification the R&R CDDAR team will
    dispatch with owning organization to designated gear up landing site. The owning
    organization will be responsible to deliver CV-22 gear up recovery equipment to site.
    CDDAR team will assist equipment set-up. Team Chief will clear personnel from site and
    owning organization will marshall CV-22 onto recovery equipment. After engine shut down
    Team Chief will resume recovery process.
5. CDDAR TRAINING AND EXERCISES:
    5.1. Partner units will coordinate with 100 MXS Maintenance Flight (MXMT), 100th
    Maintenance Group (MXG) Quality Assurance (QA), and 100 ARW Plans and Programs to
    conduct annual joint CDDAR training exercises. 100 MXG/QA and partner unit QA will
    provide the scenario for and evaluate each exercise. These exercises will utilize partner unit
    aircraft except for 95 RS assets. 100 ARW aircraft will be utilized in place of 95 RS assets
    and will include simulated lifting of operational aircraft.
    5.2. Due to limited resources and costs, the use of consumable materials during exercises
    will be held to a minimum as long as proficiency to utilize said equipment can be
    demonstrated by the CDDAR team.
    5.3. Partner units may participate in 100 ARW exercises in order to obtain general CDDAR
    training.
       5.3.1. 100 MXS/MXMT R&R will notify partner units of potential exercises in order to
       get max participation from partner units.
    5.4. Exercises that are scheduled between base and civilian authorities will be utilized to the
    maximum extent possible for CDDAR training for difficult to reach areas such as water or
    mountain recovery, if available.
    5.5. The 100 MXS/MXMT R&R section is required to complete initial formal CDDAR team
    training and annual recurring training, as well as conducting an annual exercise to be
    evaluated by 100 MXG/QA.
       5.5.1. Initial CDDAR team training will be documented in the Training Business Area.
       To qualify as a CDDAR Team Chief, the member must be a Senior NCO or - waived
       NCO. Qualification is tracked on the Special Certification Roster.
    5.6. The 100 MXS/MXMT CDDAR Team Chief will update the 100 MXS Commander at
    least annually on the status and the results of joint host/partner unit training exercises.
6. VEHICLE/EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
    6.1. 100 MXG will supply the following equipment and operators to support all CDDAR
    operations.
       6.1.1. General Purpose truck (preferred, 6 pax 4x4) equipped with Land Mobile Radio.
       6.1.2. Crane (if available).
MILDENHALLI21-101 11 APRIL 2013                                                              5


       6.1.3. Powered and Non-Powered Aerospace Ground Equipment as required, i.e. aircraft
       jacks, light carts, compressors, tow bars, etc.
       6.1.4. 26 TON lifting bags and manifolds.
       6.1.5. CDDAR Consolidated Tool Kit (CTK) equipped with slings, belly bands, snatch
       cables, chains, etc. Specific equipment is at the discretion of the 100 MXS/MXMT
       Flight Chief. Manage CDDAR CTK IAW AFI 21-101, Chapter 10.
       6.1.6. 100 AMXS/352 SOMXS/TA section will supply tow vehicle and operator as
       required by OSC or Team Chief.
   6.2. 100th Logistics Readiness Squadron will supply special purpose vehicles and operators
   as requested by the OSC or Team Chief, i.e. tractor capable of pulling flatbed trailer.
   6.3. 100th Civil Engineer Squadron will supply heavy earth moving equipment and
   operators as requested by the OSC or Team Chief, i.e. bulldozer, etc.
   6.4. Equipment not available on RAF Mildenhall should first be sourced from RAF
   Lakenheath. If still unavailable, utilize the emergency fund established by the 100th
   Comptroller Squadron to rent the necessary equipment.
7. General. Supervisors at all levels must recognize the sources of hazards and apply
appropriate risk management measures to minimize their effect. Developing specific procedures
for every possible emergency scenario is impossible. All crash recovery actions are coordinated
through the emergency operations center to the OSC and the Team Chief. During the recovery
process the Team Chief or OSC may appoint a qualified CDDAR team member to the
emergency operations center as a liaison. Participation in wing crash recovery exercises and
adherence to technical data and safety precautions are crucial to the success of CDDAR
operations.
