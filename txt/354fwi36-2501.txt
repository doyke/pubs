This instruction implements AFPD 36-25, Military Promotion and Demotion and establishes
procedures, policy, and responsibilities that apply to all squadrons, to include tenant units, on
Randolph Air Force Base. This instruction is provided to explain and standardize the processing
procedures for the SrA BTZ Promotion Program. Both the Central Base Board (CBB) and large
units will utilize the procedures outlined in this instruction and within AFI 36-2502, Airman
Promotion/Demotion Program. Ensure that all records created, as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using AF Form 847,

Education and Training Command Units.

1. PURPOSE
   1.1. The purpose of this instruction is to establish SrA BTZ selection procedures for the
   Central Base Board (CBB) and for large unit boards.
   1.2. The procedures established will be documented to ensure fair, equitable, and timely SrA
   BTZ promotion consideration.
 2                                                         354FWI36-2501 27 OCTOBER 2010


     1.3. The 354 FW will conduct regularly scheduled selection boards. These boards are
     usually held during the first week of the following months: March, June, September, and
     December.
2. PROGRAM OBJECTIVE To provide an opportunity for exceptionally well qualified
Airmen First Class (A1C) a one-time consideration for promotion to SrA, to be effective 6
months prior to the fixed fully-qualified phase point. Selection opportunity is 15 percent of the
eligible population based on total time-in-grade (TIG) and time-in-service (TIS) and quality
factors.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
     3.1. The 354th Fighter Wing Commander is the promotion authority for the CBB.
     3.2. The 354th Fighter Wing Command Chief will coordinate with the Military Personnel
     Section (MPS), to establish a CBB date and select four SNCOs as board members.
     3.3. The Personnel System Manager provides an automatic quarterly end of month output
     product to the Career Development element, within the first 10 days of the first processing
     month (i.e., Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct).
        3.3.1. The roster identifies all A1Cs who meet or exceed the time-in-service (TIS) and
        time-in-grade (TIG) requirements, regardless of promotion ineligibility conditions (i.e.,
        on the control roster, PAFSC skill level too low, undergoing Article 15 suspended
        reduction, etc.), and whose grade status reason (GSR) does not equal code “5Q”
        (previously considered for SrA BTZ).
        3.3.2. This output product automatically updates the GSR to “5Q” to prevent them from
        appearing on future SrA BTZ listings. (NOTE: If another GSR is updated to the record
        after the GSR “5Q” is updated, they may erroneously appear on a future SrA BTZ
        listing.) Rosters are in three parts:
                Part I. Identifies A1Cs with no quality indicators in their record.

                Part II. Lists “questionable eligibles” (individuals with quality indicators) that
                may not be qualified for BTZ promotion (i.e., member on Fit Program, under
                investigation, etc.)

                Part III. Lists A1Cs who meet the TIG and TIS requirements, but cannot be
                selected due to promotion ineligibility conditions listed in AFI 36-2502, Airman
                Promotion/Demotion Program, Table 1.1. (i.e., member has a referral EPR,
                control roster, etc.)
     3.4. The MPS Career Development element will review the TIG and TIS of each airman
     appearing on the MPS listing to ensure they meet current quarter TIG and TIS requirements
     (regardless of ineligible condition) and remove names of those who do not meet the
     requirements.
        3.4.1. Distributes quotas based on 15 percent of eligibles and obtains host wing
        commander approval of selectee list.
        3.4.2. Verify BTZ eligibility of all A1Cs who have a projected permanent change of
        station (PCS). Prepare a BTZ selection folder for airman departing prior to the 1st
354FWI36-2501 27 OCTOBER 2010                                                                   3


     processing month for the BTZ quarter they are TIG/TIS eligible and whose RNLTD is
     the 1st day of the 1st processing month or later.
  3.5. When commanders of small units (6 or less eligibles) have promotion authority over
  two or more units the eligibles are combined and the unit commander complies with
  established large or small unit procedures.
  3.6. Commanders of large units (7 or more eligibles) underline selectee’s name, sign, date,
  and return the unit roster along with the board minutes to the Career Development element
  no later than the date indicated on roster.
  3.7. First Sergeants are to coordinate with their commanders on all quality force factors
  concerning each eligible airman meeting the TIG/TIS requirements.
  3.8. The unit POC will ensure all eligibles have been properly identified as eligible and their
  personnel data is accurate and complete. The unit POC must verify each airman who is
  promotion eligible for BTZ consideration.
4. ELIGIBILITY
  4.1. Fully qualified minimum requirements for SrA are 36 months TIS and 20 months TIG,
  or 28 months TIG, whichever occurs first (sample of timeline is provided at attachment 2).
  4.1.1. The member must meet promotion requirements established in AFI 36-2502, Airman
  Promotion /Demotion Program, Table 2.1. Individuals in AFSCs 1C2X1 and 1T2X1 are
  ineligible for BTZ consideration IAW AFI 36-2502, Para 2.2.
  4.2. Other significant dates are as follows:
         PROCESSING MONTHS              SELECTION MONTH               PROMOTION
         JAN/FEB                             MAR                      APR-JUN
         APR/MAY                             JUN                      JUL-SEP
         JUL/AUG                             SEP                      OCT-DEC
         OCT/NOV                             DEC                      JAN-MAR


5. QUOTAS
  5.1. Quotas are based on 15 percent of the total TIG and TIS eligible population, regardless
  of normal ineligibility conditions. Large units (7 or more eligibles) receive quotas and
  promote at unit level. Small units (6 or less eligibles) are combined into one pool of eligibles
  to form the CBB population. Quotas are computed and distributed as follows:
      Computation: Eligibles multiplied by 15 percent equals the quota

      Example: 13 eligibles x 0.15 = 1.95, or 2 BTZ Quotas

      (Note: Fractions of 0.5 or more are rounded up)
4                                                           354FWI36-2501 27 OCTOBER 2010




        Distribution:

                        Eligibles        Quota      Eligibles     Quota
                          7-9              1         37-43          6
                         10-16             2         44-49          7
                         17-23             3         50-56          8
                         24-29             4         57-63          9
                        30-36              5         64-69         10


    5.2. Units may not aggregate at the group level. Since each unit commander has promotion
    authority, they should not be considered by the group, but as individual units, and cannot be
    added together to make a large unit.
6. LARGE UNITS PROCEDURES
    6.1. Large units will receive their own quotas and make selections at the unit level.
    Commanders of large units will convene a board prior to the last duty day before the
    processing month. Follow the same procedures as the CBB.
    6.2. Large units must consider all qualified individuals meeting TIG and TIS requirements,
    even if they are TDY, on leave, or have a projected assignment with a report no later than
    date during or subsequent to the processing month.
    6.3. The review process must be fair and equitable for all individuals. If any nominated
    member will not be present for the selection process due to circumstances beyond the
    member’s control (TDY, emergency leave, convalescent leave, hospitalization, etc.), the
    board will review records only.
    6.4. Once selections are made forward the minutes of the board and signed unit roster to the
    Career Development element no later than the date indicated on the roster (sample of minutes
    is provided at attachment 3).
    6.5. A unit is not required to use all quotas if the quality of the nominations is not sufficient
    to warrant it. If any quotas are not used, indicate by annotating roster before returning to
    MPS.
7. SMALL UNIT/CBB SELECITON PROCEDURES
    7.1. Small units may only nominate one name for the CBB; unless a written request is
    submitted to the 354 FW/CCC (sample written request is provided at attachment 4).
    7.2. Units will complete an AF Form 1206. The AF Form 1206 must not exceed 19 lines,
    and must be in bullet format with no headings.
    7.3. Rosters must have nominees’ name underlined, signed, and dated. Roster, AF Form
    1206 and written request approved by CCC must be returned to the Career Development
    element NLT the last duty day before the selection month.
354FWI36-2501 27 OCTOBER 2010                                                                   5



8. BOARD COMPOSITION
  8.1. When a large unit board convenes, it will consist of four SNCOs as board members, a
  nonvoting recorder in the grade of SrA or higher, and a board president in the grade of
  CMSgt. If a CMSgt is not available in the unit, the convening unit’s group commander will
  appoint a CMSgt from another unit as the board president.
  8.2. The CBB will consist of four SNCOs as board members, a nonvoting recorder in the
  grade of SrA, or higher, and the board president, who will be the 354 FW/CCC or a
  designated CMSgt.
     8.2.1. Selection folders for all SrA BTZ boards will include AF Form 1206, BTZ RIP,
     and decoration citations (if applicable). The UPRG should not be used as an alternative to
     the BTZ selection folder. Destroy or give selection folders to the individual when no
     longer needed.      When assessing education levels, please take AFSC, training
     requirements, and work schedules into consideration; all A1Cs may not have the same
     opportunity to complete off-duty education.
9. SCORING SCALE
  9.1. The selection board will evaluate each nominee based on the score sheet (sample score
  sheets are provided in attachment 9). Once the board is concluded, all scores will be
  tabulated and a merit order listing will be produced showing the relative ranking of each
  nominee.
  9.2. Board members will rank order nominees 1 through 5. The board president will record
  placement of each nominee on a score sheet and ensure no more than a two-place difference
  between any nominees (sample score sheets are provided in attachment 8). (Example: If one
  board member rated a nominee 1st and another board member rated the same nominee 4th.
  The board president is responsible for resolving this issue prior to board completion). The
  nominee with the lowest total of Final Merit Rank Order scores is that board’s winner.
  9.3. Board presidents will resolve all ties before the board is released. Resolution of ties and
  score sheet differences will be documented by the board president. All board members score
  sheets and related documentation (ties/differences, etc.) will be returned to the wing
  command section as part of the final package.
10. NOTIFICATION OF SELECTEES
  10.1. The names of promotion selectees will be released to unit commanders and/or first
  sergeants after the promotion authority approves the board proceedings. In addition, large
  units are not to inform their selectees until the promotion authority signs the CBB Board
  Minutes.
  10.2. Alternate selectees may be selected in the event a selectee is removed, or not
  recommended for promotion before the promotion effective date. The MPS will review board
  minutes to determine who the first alternate is and notify the individual’s commander. If the
  commander recommends the alternate for promotion, forward a letter to the MPS for the
  concurrence of 354 FW/CC (sample format is provided at attachment 5).
 6                                                         354FWI36-2501 27 OCTOBER 2010



11. SUPPLEMENTAL CONSIDERATION
     11.1. Commanders may request supplemental BTZ consideration for individuals that should
     have been considered by a previous board and the error is not discovered until after
     promotions are announced. Contact the losing unit and MPS before requesting supplemental
     consideration.
     11.2. Forward a written request with justification to the Career Development Office (sample
     of request if provided in attachment 5). Requests will be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPPPWM
     for consideration via e-mail.
     11.3. Supplemental consideration will not be given for the following reasons:
           Incorrect data reflected on the BTZ RIP.

           Denied BTZ nomination due to incorrect data reflected on the BTZ output products or
           in the UPRG.

           BTZ eligibility listing not returned to the MPS or individual was “overlooked” on the
           listing.

           Nomination package or decoration not completed/turned in/approved in time to meet
           the board.
     11.4. If selected, units will be notified by the MPS. The member will be considered at the
     next regularly scheduled CBB. Ensure records reflect only decorations that would have been
     in the record at the time of the original board had the member been correctly considered
     during their normal BTZ quarter.
        11.4.1. Board members will not be told which airman is being supplementally
        considered, and the member's score must tie or exceed the established cutoff in order to
        be selected.
        11.4.2. If member is selected, another quota is authorized (if not selected, the additional
        quota cannot be used). If selected, the member will receive the date of rank the member
        would have received from the original board; that effective date will be the date of the
        special order.
        11.4.3. MPS will assist the member in applying for a retroactive promotion effective date
        in accordance with AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program, para 1.13.
