maintenance representative to the crash recovery team for the purpose of evaluating and assisting
in the resolution of an incident. If crash recovery personnel are not trained on characteristic of
the specific aircraft MDS, OSC will coordinate for assistance with the owning unit via the 366
FW Command Post. Assistance may range from owning unit dispatching a certified crash
recovery team chief for the MDS, to a request for a full recovery crew with equipment,
depending upon the circumstances at the incident site.
5. Requests for Media Information. Channel communications by the crash recovery team
through OSC. Crash recovery team members will not volunteer information or make statements
to the media. Requests for media information or statements will be referred to 366 FW/PA
(Public Affairs). 366 FW/PA will provide an alert photographer, briefed by 366 FW/CVN, to
