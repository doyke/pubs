        1.1.5. (Added) AETC CPs requiring clarification on HAF or MAJCOM guidance will
        submit request via email to AETC/A3OC workflow e-mail account
        (AETC.A3OC.workflow@us.af.mil).
     1.3. Organization.
     1.3.1. As part of the HQ AETC C2 system, the AETC Command Center is also tasked with
     providing 24-hour C2 operational support to the AETC commander, Air Force Personnel
     Center (AFPC) commander, Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS) commander, and HQ
     AETC A2/3O at Randolph AFB.
            1.3.1.1. (Added) The 502nd Air Base Wing Command Post (502 ABW/CP) is the
            designated alternate to the AETC Command Center. If at any time the AETC
            Command center would become unavailable to carry out its mission, the 502
            ABW/CP would assume AETC Command Center responsibilities and authority.
        1.4.1. (Added) AETC units on non-AETC installations will establish formal
        memorandums of understanding (MOU) or memorandums of agreement (MOA) with the

        workflow e-mail account for coordination prior to signature. Once agreements are
        signed, re-submit to HQ AETC/A3OC.
        1.6.9. (Added) The CP will not be responsible for creating or briefing the monthly
        Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) for the installation commander. This
        stipulation does not preclude the CP managers from updating assigned installation
        Mission Essential Tasks (METs) and Mission-Essential Task Lists (METLs).
        2.3.16. Standardize CPs to the maximum extent possible.
        2.3.17. Coordinate with other applicable MAJCOM staffs for all Consolidated CP/ CP
        Association/Regional CP under its authority for resolution and clarification of training,
        staffing, and procedural issues.
     2.4. MAJCOM or HHQ Command Centers will.
        2.4.10. (Added) Transmit Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) to AETC units and
        AETC-gained units using a secure and reliable SIPRNET message communication
        system. To facilitate message build/transmission procedures and command wide
        controller proficiency, the AETC Command Center will build and transmit a minimum of
        two exercise messages every 24 hours. At no time will the AETC Command Center
        purposely send out invalid EAMs.

       follow-up reporting until a final report is submitted within 7 days of the initial report.
       2.6.33. (Added) Be a primary member of the Commander’s Senior Staff. Exception:
       This does not apply to ANG and AFRC units.
       2.6.34. (Added) Maintain a CP Controller Information File (CIF) binder containing
       information of a temporary and/or supplemental nature pertinent to CP operations and
       controller personnel. Establish monthly procedures to remove CIF items that are no
       longer applicable. File other items of continuing value and incorporate them into local
       directives and training programs. AETC CIF guidance will remain until superseded or
       deemed obsolete by HQ AETC/A3OC. All controllers, including back office staff will
       review and initial all CIFs before assuming console or staff duty.
       2.6.35. (Added) Maintain a six-month history of controller shift duty schedules. When

        decertification at the discretion of the Command Post SAV or IG team.
     7.17.3. Controllers failing to achieve a 90% (or above) score on HHQ administered EA
     examinations and/or substandard performance (“UNSAT” rating) during any HHQ
     observed event (e.g., SAV or IG) may result in immediate decertification at the discretion
     of the Command Post SAV or IG team.
        8.6.2.5. Command Posts/Command Centers will document their semiannual
        activation on a Memorandum for Record (MFR). This MFR will be maintained in the
        relocation kit as well as the self inspection binder for a minimum of two years. The
        MFR will include the following paragraphs:

          aligning personnel to specific tempo bands in accordance with (IAW) the respective
          Headquarters Air Force Functional Area Manager (HAF FAM) Posturing and
          Sequencing Guidance. AETC 1C3X1 controllers fulfill Command Post (9ACP) Unit
          Type Codes (UTCs) and aligned in tempo band D. All 9ACP UTCs are one-person
          UTCs which provide better AFSC accountability and align UTCs with Combatant
          Commander requirements.          AETC 1C3X1 instructors and headquarters staff
          personnel constitute the Institutional Force structure (forces assigned to organizations
          responsible to carry out SECAF Title 10 functions at the AF level (i.e. organize, train,
          equip, recruit, supply, etc.). All personnel assigned to an “X-coded” UDC receive an
          AEF Indicator (AEFI) of X1 to X5. Individuals identified as Institutional Forces will
          be utilized to source the Individual Augmentee (IA) requirements and other AF
          shortfalls. AFPC will use the member’s last date deployed, # of short tours, and short
          tour return date to make the selection to fill the IA requirements. Sourcing will NOT
          be accomplished by AETC/A3OC for AEFI X1 to X5 personnel.
          11.3.3.2. (Added) CP Chiefs and Superintendents (and 1C3 training squadron
          Instructor/Supervisors) must ensure assigned 1C3X1 personnel are trained and
          prepared to deploy. CP Chiefs and Superintendents must ensure their personnel’s
          readiness is properly annotated in the AEF Reporting Tool (ART). Institutional
          Forces do not report in ART. Deployment training and accurate ART reporting will
          continue to be special interest items during AETC/A3OC Staff Assistance Visits.
          11.3.3.3. (Added) ART is the system the Air Force uses to inform the Air and Space
          Expeditionary Force Center (AEFC) of the readiness status of individual UTCs. For
          the system to be useful, information entered must accurately reflect the status of
          personnel in the UTC. In addition to monthly reporting requirements, units must
          ensure to update ART within 24 hours of an assessment change (i.e., member loses
          clearance, medical profile, etc.).
              11.3.3.3.1. (Added) ART reporting is based on the traffic light color system:
              green, yellow, and red. Green identifies the UTC as trained and ready to go.
              Yellow means there is a missing or deficient capability, but this does not prevent
              the UTC from being tasked (e.g., the deficiency is waiverable). Red indicates the
              UTC has a critical missing or deficient capability and it cannot be tasked or is
              otherwise unable to accomplish its mission (e.g., pregnancy, medical profile
              preventing deployment). The association of a specific UTC with its status
              (green/yellow/red) is classified SECRET.
AFI10-207_AETCSUP 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                              9


            11.3.3.3.2. (Added) ART remarks need to be specific enough so that
            AETC/A3OC and AFPC/DPW know exactly if a UTC is available to deploy and
            if it is not. In order for the AEFC to match individual capabilities to requirements,
            the following additional information must be entered in the “Commander’s
            Remarks” block of ART reports:
               11.3.3.3.2.1. (Added) Member: rank/name of the individual aligned against
               that UTC (e.g., SSgt Jane Doe)
               11.3.3.3.2.2. (Added) AFSC:         this  will      identify    the    member’s
               current/awarded skill level (e.g., 1C351)
               11.3.3.3.2.3. (Added) Clearance: current security clearance (Secret, TS, or
               SCI/DCID eligible)
               11.3.3.3.2.4. (Added) Deployment Availability Codes (DAV): list codes
               that identify an individual's current medical, legal and administrative status for
               deployment eligibility. Refer to AFI 10-403 (table A2.2) for DAV code
               listing. NOTE: Do not state the specific reason a member cannot deploy as
               this may violate The Privacy Act of 1974 or the Health Insurance Portability
               and Accountability Act (HIPAA). (e.g., DAV: 64 or DAV: None)
               11.3.3.3.2.5. (Added) Medical Profile: Yes or No. UTCs for individuals
               with profiles who are not World Wide Qualified, should be coded red with an
               annotated “get well date.” Consider whether individuals who are coded
               red should be referred to a medical evaluation board
               11.3.3.3.2.6. (Added) Remarks: Other remarks may be added as necessary.
               (examples such as, “Member does not meet UTC skill level requirement,
               GWD: MMM YY”. “Member undergoing MEB”. “Member has approved
               separation date of DD MMM YY”.
            11.3.3.3.3. (Added) SEIs and prior deployments are identified and tracked
            through the monthly CP manning report and are not required items for AETC CP
            ART reporting.
     12.2.2. (Added) Forward all AETC SAV requests to the AETC 1C3 Functional
     Manager through the AETC/A3OC workflow e-mail account.
