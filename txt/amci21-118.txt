This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Managing Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance, to provide guidance on interior color and material configuration on AMC aircraft by type
and mission. It applies to all AMC units and AFRC associate units possessing C-5, C-17, C-130, KC-10
and KC-135 aircraft. All AMC maintenance squadrons (MXS) and equipment maintenance squadrons
(EMS) with refurbishment elements will maintain a current copy of this instruction. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accor-
dance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This interim change 2006-3 to AMCI 21-1118 provides updates to office symbols, references, and prod-
uct information. A bar (|) indicates changes since the last edition.


1. General Information. The objective of the refurbishment program is to maintain the interior appear-
ance of Air Mobility Command aircraft. Primary benefits of the program are increased functionality, pride
in ownership, morale, and comfort.

2. Forms Prescribed. AMC Form 1019, Aircraft-Specific Refurbishment Work Cards. Blank forms
are available electronically on the Air Force Transaction System (ETS). Use the overprint for C-130E/H
aircraft, available electronically on ETS.

3. Policy.
    3.1. The wing commander (or group commander if AMC is a tenant) is responsible for the mainte-
    nance of assigned aircraft.
    3.2. All group commanders ensure operators and maintainers bear equal responsibility for the clean-
    liness, appearance, and serviceability of aircraft interiors.
    3.3. Refurbishment is defined as “the restoration of an aircraft interior to like-new appearance.” Exte-
    rior coating system maintenance will be scheduled per TO 1-1-8 paragraphs 5-15 and 9-2.5.1 and may
    be accomplished during refurbishment.
    3.4. Materials used to perform refurbishments will be environmentally acceptable, in accordance with
    local, state, and federal laws.
       3.4.1. All feasibly removable interior components should be painted off-aircraft in an approved
       paint facility.
       3.4.2. MIL-PRF-23377 (epoxy primer) and MIL-PRF-85285 (polyurethane topcoat) are the pre-
       ferred coatings for removable components unless otherwise directed by system-specific technical
       data.
       3.4.3. Coatings sprayed on aircraft will comply with local, state, and federal environmental stan-
       dards. MIL-PRF-23377 (primer) and MIL-PRF-85285 (polyurethane topcoat) are the preferred
       interior coatings where possible. Latex paint systems are preferred in regions where polyurethane
       cannot be used.
       3.4.4. Non-approved coating materials will not be used. HQ AMC/A4M and systems group (SG)
       concurrence are required for replacements.
    3.5. Safe work methods must be developed and employed.
       3.5.1. High efficiency particulate air (HEPA) vacuum equipment, including pneumatic sanders,
       will be used when possible to reduce health hazards caused by airborne particles.
       3.5.2. Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) will be used for all refurbishment opera-
       tions.
    3.6. All aircraft will bear standardized AMC colors and materials. No waivers will be granted.
       3.6.1. Night vision systems (NVIS) compatibility will be standardized by MDS and model. For
       example, all C-130E aircraft will be configured in the same manner, while all C-130H3 aircraft
       will be configured alike.
       3.6.2. Aircraft with unique mission requirements, such as fire fighting, will be standardized to the
       maximum degree possible.
    3.7. All AMC and AFRC associate wing aircraft will bear the standardized interior materials and col-
    ors specified in this instruction.
       3.7.1. Owning units will determine refurbishment schedules to suit mission needs based on air-
       craft condition. Local programs may follow chronological guidelines if deemed appropriate by the
       maintenance group commander; however, an aircraft will not undergo refurbishment based solely
       on time; the interior condition must warrant refurbishment.
AMCI21-118 1 SEPTEMBER 2002                                                                             3


      3.7.2. Scheduled maintenance and/or inspections will not be used as the sole basis for refurbish-
      ment scheduling. Periodic maintenance should be scheduled and performed during isochronal
      (ISO), home station check (HSC), and periodic depot maintenance (PDM) inspections.
          3.7.2.1. Additional maintenance and inspections may be performed in conjunction with refur-
          bishment.
   3.8. Units participating in competitions, such as the Airlift Rodeo, will follow the guidelines estab-
   lished in the competition rules for aircraft appearance. No special interior modifications or upgrades
   are authorized.
   3.9. Aircraft will be scored prior to selection for refurbishment in accordance with applicable techni-
   cal data. Units develop local scoring procedures in the absence of technical data scoring procedures.
   3.10. Aircraft interior (and exterior if scheduled for paint touch-up) will be thoroughly washed imme-
   diately prior to refurbishment.

4. Command Standard Materials and Colors.
   4.1. All fabrics used on aircraft will conform to FAA and FAR flame retardant specifications.
   4.2. Flight deck and passenger (airline style) seats will be covered with polyester fabric (supersedes
   Silver State Suppliers nylon fabric).
      4.2.1. Standard seat color is cobalt blue. NVIS compatible aircraft will utilize smoke gray as the
      standard color.
      4.2.2. Slight color variances between material vendors and lots are to be expected, and are accept-
      able. However, obvious or extreme color differences will be avoided.
      4.2.3. Sheepskin inserts will be added to all primary crew position seats and flight deck seats to
      include loadmaster seats.
          4.2.3.1. Repeated cleaning necessitates fire retardant re-application on inserts; fire retardant
          must be re-applied in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. Units are responsible for
          documenting and tracking cleaning and fire retardant application cycles.

5. Weapon System-Specific Guidance.
   5.1. HQ AMC/A4M weapon system functional managers are responsible for ensuring AMC Form
   1019, Aircraft-Specific Refurbishment Work Cards; reflect the policies in this instruction.
   5.2. C-130 units will utilize the AMC Form 1019 OVERPRINT (AM101901), AMC work cards
   available on ETS. Contact your local base publishing manager to develop specific overprints.
