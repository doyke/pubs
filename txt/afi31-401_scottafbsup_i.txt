                                            Chapter 1

                         POLICY AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

1.1. Policy . It is Air Force policy to identify, classify, downgrade, declassify, mark, protect,
and destroy its classified and unclassified information and material consistent with national
policy. This general policy statement also applies to unclassified controlled information
(Attachment 2) under the purview of relevant statutes, regulations and directives [Reference
DOD 5200.1-R, C1.1.]
1.2. Philosophy. Protecting information is critical to mission accomplishment. The goal of the
Information Security Program is to efficiently and effectively protect Air Force information by
delegating authority to the lowest levels possible; encouraging and advocating use of risk
management principles; focusing on identifying and protecting only that information that
requires protection; integrating security procedures into our business processes so that they
become transparent; and, ensuring everyone understands their security roles and responsibilities.
1.3. Program Management. The strength of the Air Force Information Security Program is in
its infrastructure. The infrastructure is important because it facilitates effective communication of
our security policies and procedures to those performing the Air Force mission. With the support
of commanders at all levels, this is accomplished predominantly through our Information
Security Program Manager (ISPM) and security manager system. Both play an integral role in
ensuring unit personnel know and understand their role in protecting classified information
against unauthorized disclosure [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C1.2.]
   1.3.1. Senior Security Official. The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air
   Force (SAF/ AA) is designated the Air Force Senior Security Official responsible for

     program. Alternate security managers may be appointed as necessary. Commanders or
     equivalents, and staff agency chiefs should consider Air Expeditionary Force rotation
     cycles, TDY, training requirements, and other assigned duties. Continuity should receive
     serious consideration in selection of security managers. Military security managers must
     have a favorable National Agency Check, local agency check, and credit check
     (NACLC); civilians a National Agency Check with written inquiries and credit check
     (ANACI), investigation or higher and eligibility for JPAS access before appointment.

2.2. Original Classification. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 2 and Interim Information
Security Guidance, April 16, 2004.]
   2.2.1. Original classification is the initial decision that an item of information could be
   expected to cause damage to the national security if subjected to unauthorized disclosure, and
   that the interests of the national security are best served by applying the safeguards of the
   Information Security Program to protect it. This decision may be made only by persons who
   have been specifically delegated the authority to do so, have received training in the exercise
   of this authority, and have program responsibility or cognizance over the information
   [Reference: DOD 5200.1-R, C2.1.]
       2.2.1.1. Before an original classification decision is made, it must be determined that
       classification guidance is not already available in the form of classification guides, plans
       or other memoranda.
       2.2.1.2. OCAs are accountable to the Secretary of Defense for their classification
       decisions.
       2.2.1.3. In those rare situations where the OCAs‘ decision must be rendered verbally due
       to the priorities of an on-going operation, written confirmation will be issued within
       seven days.
       2.2.1.4. OCAs must notify users when there are changes to an original decision.
       2.2.1.5. OCAs shall be prepared to present, as required, deposition and expert testimony
       in courts of law concerning classification of national security information and be
       prepared to defend and justify their original decisions.
   2.2.2. Classification may be applied only to information that is owned by, produced by or
   for, or is under the control of the United States Government. Information may be considered
   for classification only if it concerns one of the categories specified in Section 1.4 of EO
   12958, as amended.
2.3. Derivative Classification. The act of incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating
in a new form information that is already classified, and marking the newly developed material
consistent with the markings of the source information. The source information ordinarily
consists of a classified document or a classification guide issued by an OCA. Within DOD, all
cleared personnel can perform derivative classification.
   2.3.1. Originating Agency‘s Determination Required (OADR). OADR is no longer an
   approved marking and should not be contained in any originally classified documents that
   have been created after October 14, 1995.
   2.3.2. X1 through X8 are no longer approved markings and should not be contained in any
   originally classified documents that have been created on or after September 22, 2003.
   2.3.3. When creating a derivatively classified document and using a source document that
   contains OADR or X1 through X8, the derivative classifier will place the following
   information in the Declassify On line:
        DECLASSIFY ON: Source marked OADR (or X1 thru X8, whatever is
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                           21


                               applicable)
        Date of source: 5 October 1993 (date of source document)

   2.3.4. These documents will be subject to review for declassification 25 years after the date
   of the source document.
2.4. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.
   2.4.1. Under no circumstances shall information be classified in order to (1) conceal
   violation of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; (2) prevent embarrassment to a person,
   organization, or agency; (3) restrain competition; or (4) prevent or delay the release of
   information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security [Reference
   EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.7, DOD 5200.1-R, and Interim Information Security
   Guidance 16 April 2004].
   2.4.2. The OCA having jurisdiction over the subject matter determines if information
   requested under the FOIA or the mandatory declassification review (MDR) provisions of EO
   12958, as amended, should be declassified [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C2.4.3.5.]
2.5. Classification Challenges [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C4.9.]
   2.5.1. If holders of information have reason to believe that the information is improperly or
   unnecessarily classified, they shall communicate that belief to their commander or
   equivalent, staff agency chief, security manager, or supervisor.
   2.5.2. Send formal challenges to classification, in writing, to the OCA with jurisdiction over
   the information in question.
   2.5.3. Challenges to reclassification decisions are sent through command IP channels to
   SAF/AAP
   2.5.4. All classified information undergoing a challenge or a subsequent appeal will remain
   classified until a final resolution is reached.
2.6. Security Classification/Declassification Guides.
   2.6.1. Required Elements. A security classification/declassification guide (see Attachment 7
   for sample format) is the written record of an original classification decision and appropriate
   declassification instructions and should be issued as early as practical in the life cycle of the
   classified system, plan, program or project. It shall, at a minimum:
       2.6.1.1. Identify the subject matter of the classification guide.
       2.6.1.2. Identify the OCA by name or personal identifier, and position.
       2.6.1.3. Identify an agency Point of Contact (POC) (name, office symbol, mailing
       address, organizational e-mail address, DSN/commercial phone numbers) for questions
       regarding the classification guide.
       2.6.1.4. Provide the date of issuance or last review.
       2.6.1.5. State precisely the categories or elements of information to be declassified, to be
       downgraded, or not to be declassified.
22                                        AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


     2.6.1.6. State which classification level applies to each element of information, and,
     when useful, specify the elements of information that are unclassified (NOTE: only one
     level of classification will be annotated for each element of information.)
     2.6.1.7. State a concise reason for classification which, at a minimum, cites the
     applicable classification category or categories in Section 1.4 of EO 12958, as amended.
     2.6.1.8. State, when applicable, special handling caveats.
     2.6.1.9. Prescribe declassification instructions for each element of classified information.
     2.6.1.10. Identify any related files series that have been exempted from automatic
     declassification pursuant to Section 3.3(c) of EO 12958, as amended.
     2.6.1.11. To the extent a guide is used in conjunction with the automatic declassification
     provisions in Section 3.3 of EO 12958, as amended, state precisely the elements of
     information to be exempted from declassification to include:
         2.6.1.11.1. The appropriate exemption category listed in section 3.3(b), and, when
         citing the exemption category listed in section 3.3(b)(9), specify the applicable
         statute, treaty or international agreement; and
         2.6.1.11.2. A date or event for declassification IAW section 1.5
  2.6.2. OCA Responsibilities.
     2.6.2.1. It is the responsibility of the OCA to publish classification/declassification
     guides to facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification and declassification of
     their information. NOTE: In some cases, OCAs may determine that publishing
     classification guidance in other forms is more effective, e.g., program protection plans,
     system protection guides, AFIs. In these cases, the applicable publication will be
     considered the guide and the publishing requirements in paragraph 3.3 still apply.
     2.6.2.2. Each OCA will revise (IAW paragraph 2.6.2.4 below) their security
     classification guides to include an advisory statement in the Release of Information
     section:
         2.6.2.2.1. Release of program data on the World Wide Web. Extreme care must be
         taken when considering information for release onto publicly accessible or
         unprotected World Wide Web sites. In addition to satisfying all of the aforementioned
         approval provisions, owners and/or releasers of information proposed for such release
         must ensure that it is not susceptible to compilation with other information to render
         sensitive or even classified data in the aggregate. The search and data mining
         capabilities of Web technology must be assessed from a risk management
         perspective. Information intended for publication on publicly accessible or
         unprotected web sites must be cleared for public release prior to publication
         according to AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policy and Procedures. If there are any
         doubts, do not release the information.
     2.6.2.3. All guides will be reviewed by the servicing Foreign Disclosure Office before
     final approval.
     2.6.2.4. Classification/declassification security guides shall be reviewed and updated, as
     circumstances require, but at least once every five years. NOTE: Due to the major
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                       23


      changes implemented by EO 12958, as amended, all current Air Force
      classification/declassification guides will be reviewed no later than 31 December 2005,
      and every five years thereafter.
   2.6.3. Publishing Requirements.
      2.6.3.1. All guides which extend classification beyond 25 years must be approved by the
      Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP). Once the OCA has signed
      the guide, the document will be sent to SAF/AAP who will forward it to the ISCAP for
      approval.
      2.6.3.2. The OCA will report publication of or changes to security classification/
      declassification guides to the Administrator, Defense Technical Information Center
      (DTIC) using DD Form 2024. DTIC will require an electronic copy of the guide.
      2.6.3.3. OCAs must also forward a hard copy of the applicable publication or change to:
          2.6.3.3.1. HQ AFHRA/RSA, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424.
          2.6.3.3.2. SAF/PA, 1690 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1690.
      2.6.3.4. All guides (to include any changes) will also be forwarded electronically to
      SAF/AAP        at     SAF.AAP.workflow@pentagon.af.mil         and     AFDO        at
      AFDO.Workflow@pentagon.af.mil in PDF and Microsoft Word format.
   2.6.4. Electronic Location of Guides. SAF/AAP will maintain the master list of all Air
   Force classification/declassification guides and will provide guides made available on the
   MOSIAC SIPRNET Community of Practice (CoP). Guides are also located on the DTIC
   web site. To access the DTIC web site you must have a DTIC account. The URL for this is
   http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/registration.
   2.6.5. Nuclear Weapons Classification Policy. The DOD and the Department of Energy
   (DoE) issue joint security classification guidance for information relating to nuclear
   weapons. The Air Force issues security classification policy for information relating to
   nuclear weapons. Most of these products are classified and users will require the appropriate
   security clearance before accessing them. Users may obtain copies of Joint DOD/DoE
   classification guides through DTIC at a cost. Users forward requests for copies of these
   guides to SAF/AAP (1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1340) through
   command IP channels. Requests must include the name, address, and phone number of the
   activity POC, and the POC‘s level of access. IPs will validate this information before
   submitting the requests to SAF/AAP. For all other Air Force or other agency guides, go
   direct to the originator. Users refer to DOD 5200.1-I, DOD Index of Security Classification
   Guides, to determine what other guides relating to nuclear weapons classification guidance
   are needed. DOD 5200.1-I can be obtained from DTIC.
2.7. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Classification Coordination.
   2.7.1. (SCOTTAFB) Coordinate all classified wing plans through 375 AMW/IP for proper
   classification markings.

                                            Chapter 3

               DECLASSIFYING AND DOWNGRADING INFORMATION

3.1. Declassification and Downgrading Officials. Within the Air Force, only OCAs have the
authority to declassify or downgrade classified information.
3.2. Declassification. Note: Exemptions identified in this chapter are found in ISSO Directive
Number 1, Section 2001.21(3)(i).
   3.2.1. Originally Classified Documents. The declassification decision determines the
   duration of protection [Reference EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.6.(a)(4) and ISOO
   Directive Number 1, Section2001.12.]. At the time an item of information is classified,
   original classifiers will determine which of the following four declassification instructions
   will be used, selecting whenever possible, the declassification instruction that will result in
   the shortest duration of classification.
       3.2.1.1. A date or event less than 10 years from the date of the document; or, if unable to
       identify such a date or event;
       3.2.1.2. A date 10 years from the date of the document; or
       3.2.1.3. A date greater than 10 and less than 25 years from the date of the document; or
       3.2.1.4. A date 25 years from the date of the document.
   3.2.2. Derivatively Classified Documents. The ―Declassify on‖ line must include one of the
   following:
       3.2.2.1. The date or event up to 25 years, as noted on the source document; or
       3.2.2.2. Source marked OADR, date of source (cannot be a date after October 1995); or
       3.2.2.3. Source marked X1-X8, date of source (cannot be a date after September 2003);
       or
       3.2.2.4. 25X1 through 25X9, and a specific date or event for declassification; or
       3.2.2.5. 25X1-human (the only category that does not require a date or event follow it).
3.3. Exceptions. RD/FRD [Reference 10 CFR 1045.1 Subpart A]. Documents containing RD
or FRD are excluded from automatic declassification and do not require a declassification date.
RD must be reviewed by the DoE prior to release. DoE and DOD must jointly review documents
containing FRD prior to release.
3.4. Automatic Declassification. IAW EO 12958, as amended, Section 3.3, all Air Force
activities that possess classified information that is of permanent historical value and is 25 years
old or older should have completed a declassification review of these documents by 31 Dec
2006.
   3.4.1. The Air Force Declassification Office (AFDO) has published the Air Force
   Declassification Plan that provides the framework for Air Force compliance with Section 3.3
   of EO 12958, as amended. It pertains to all classified Air Force records that are 25 years old
   or older as of 31 December 2006, and have been determined under Federal law to have
   permanent historical value. The Air Force Declassification Plan is posted at the AFDO web
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                         25


   site (http://www.afdo.hq.af.mil/Plan.htm). It is critical that records management and
   information security personnel work together to ensure that requirements of both are met on
   classified records that are going to be sent to the National Archives or Federal Records
   Center.
   3.4.2. All classified records shall be automatically declassified on 31 December of the year
   that is 25 years from the date of its original classification, unless it falls in one of the
   exemption categories (25X) listed in Section 3.3(b) of EO 12958, as amended.
   3.4.3. The 25X categories cannot be used unless the specific information has been approved
   through the ISCAP process. This is usually done in the form of a security
   classification/declassification guide. (See paragraph 2.6 and Attachment 7.) The Air Force
   has an approved list of exemption categories (listed in the Air Force Declassification Plan);
   however, the specific item must still be annotated in the security classification/
   declassification guide before it is used on derivatively marked documents. For original
   classification decisions, no 25X marking, other than ―25X1-human,‖ is permitted on the
   ―declassify on‖ line. All originally classified documents will contain either a date or event
   less than 10 years or a date from 10 to 25 years. The only exception is the marking ―25X1-
   human.‖ This marking may be used when the disclosure of the information could be expected
   to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or human intelligence source. This is the
   only 25X marking that does not require a date or event for declassification to be cited with
   the 25X marking.
3.5. Mandatory Review.
   3.5.1. Mandatory review requests must identify the information requested with enough
   specificity to allow for location of the records with a reasonable amount of effort.
   3.5.2. Send all requests for MDR to 11 CS/SCSL (MDR), 1000 Air Force Pentagon,
   Washington DC 20330-1000.
   3.5.3. Send appeals to MDR decisions through 11 CS/SCSL (MDR) to SAF/AA, the Air
   Force Appellate Authority for MDRs.
3.6. Systematic Review for Declassification. Activities will set up an annual schedule for
conducting systematic declassification reviews for the following records:
   3.6.1. Records of permanent historical value prior to their twenty-fifth birthday. These
   records will be reviewed and appropriate action taken by 31 Dec of the same year that is 25
   years from the date of its original classification.
   3.6.2. Other records. Activities will set up a reasonable schedule for conducting
   declassification reviews for all other classified records.
3.7. Referrals. A referral is information that is subject to the provisions of EO 12958, as
amended, Section 3.3, Automatic Declassification, and ISOO Directive No. 1, Section 2001.34,
and has been referred to, within, or outside the Air Force for review. AFDO is the focal point for
processing Air Force referrals. Detailed information regarding the referral process can be found
in the Air Force Declassification Plan.
3.8. Public Release. When information is declassified, it is not releasable to the public until it
has been approved for release through the security review process IAW AFI 35-101, Chapter 15.
 26                                         AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


The same holds true for declassified or unclassified information that will be placed on an Internet
site that can be accessed by the public.
3.9. Downgrading. Downgrading of information to a lower level of classification is appropriate
when the information no longer requires protection at the originally assigned level, and can be
properly protected at a lower level. Any official who is authorized to classify or declassify the
information and has authority over the information may downgrade information.
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                         27

                                          RESTRICT
                                           ED DATA


         “This material contains Restricted Data as defined in the Atomic Energy
        Act of 1954. Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal
                                        sanctions.”
       4.3.5.2. Documents containing FRD shall be marked:
                                       FORMERLY
                                    RESTRICTED DATA


        “Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions.
        Handle as Restricted Data in foreign dissemination. Section 144.b, Atomic
                                   Energy Act, 1954”
   4.3.6. For Official Use Only (FOUO). See chapter 4 of DOD 5400.7/AF Supplement.
4.4. NATO. NATO documents should be marked in compliance with AFI 31-406, Applying
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Protection Standards, USSAN Instruction 1-69,
United States Implementation of NATO Security Procedures, and C-M(2002)49, Security Within
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Any new policies, principles, standards, and
procedures contained in C-M(2002)49 and it‘s supporting directives take precedence, where they
conflict, over the guidelines expressed in USSAN 1-69, dated 21 April 1982.
4.5. Other Foreign Government Information (FGI).
   4.5.1. Classification designations for FGI often do not parallel U.S. classification
   designations. Moreover, many foreign governments and international organizations have a
   fourth level of classification that generally translates as "Restricted," and a category of
   unclassified information that is protected by law in the originating country and is provided on
   the condition that it will be treated "in confidence." A table of U.S. and foreign government
   classification markings can be found in DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 6.
 30                                        AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


   4.5.2. Other foreign government classified documents shall be marked in English to identify
   the originating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation. If a classification
   designation has been applied to a foreign document by the originator, and it is the applicable
   U.S. English language designation, only the identity of the originating country need be
   applied to the document. Examples:
       A German document marked "Geheim" would be marked: DEU
       SECRET.
       A UK document marked "SECRET" would be marked: GBR
       SECRET.

   4.5.3. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that
   equates to Restricted, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided to a
   DOD Component on the condition that they will be treated "in confidence," shall be marked
   to identify the originating government and whether they are Restricted or provided "in
   confidence." Additionally, they shall be marked "CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling".
   Example:
             A French document marked "Diffusion Restreinte‖ would be marked:


                  FRENCH RESTRICTED INFORMATION Protect as:
                           CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling
      4.5.3.1. (Ref: DOD 5200.1-R, para C6.6.3.) In order to ensure the protection of FGI
      provided in confidence (e.g., foreign government "Restricted," or foreign government
      unclassified information provided in confidence), such information must be classified
      under EO 12958, as amended. Provide a degree of protection to the FGI at least
      equivalent to that required by the foreign government or international organization that
      provided the information. If the foreign protection requirement is lower than the
      protection required for U.S. CONFIDENTIAL information, the following requirements
      shall be met:
          4.5.3.1.1. The information shall be provided only to those individuals who have a
          need-to-know and access is required by official duties.
          4.5.3.1.2. Individuals given access shall be notified of applicable handling
          instructions.
          4.5.3.1.3. Documents shall be stored so as to prevent unauthorized access.
4.6. Marking of Foreign Government and NATO Information In DOD Documents.
   4.6.1. When used in DOD documents, FGI must be marked to prevent premature
   declassification or unauthorized disclosure. To satisfy this requirement, U.S. documents that
   contain FGI shall be marked on the cover or first page, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS
   (indicate country of origin) INFORMATION." In addition, the portions shall be marked to
   identify the classification level and the country of origin, e.g., (GBR-C); (DEU-C). If the
   identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the cover or first page of the document
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                       31


   shall be marked, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FOREIGN GOVERNMENT
   INFORMATION," and applicable paragraphs shall be marked FGI together with the
   appropriate classification (FGI-S). The identity of the foreign government shall be
   maintained with the record copy, which must be appropriately protected.
   4.6.2. The "Derived From" line shall identify the U.S. as well as foreign classification
   sources. If the identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the "Derived From" line
   shall contain the marking "Foreign Government information." In that case, the identity of the
   foreign government will be maintained with the record copy and protected appropriately. A
   U.S. document shall not be downgraded below the highest level of FGI contained in the
   document or be declassified without the written approval of the foreign government that
   originated the information. Recommendations concerning downgrading or declassification
   shall be submitted through the DOD entity that created the document to the originating
   foreign government.
   4.6.3. DOD classified documents that contain extracts of NATO classified information shall
   be marked as follows on the cover or first page: "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS NATO
   CLASSIFIED INFORMATION." Portions shall be marked to identify the NATO
   information (e.g., NS). When NATO or other foreign government RESTRICTED
   information is included in otherwise unclassified DOD documents, the following statement
   shall be affixed to the top and bottom of the page containing the information: “This page
   contains (indicate NATO or country of origin) RESTRICTED information”. The
   restricted portions shall be marked (e.g., (NR) (GBR-R). The cover, (or first page, if no
   cover) of the document shall contain the following statement: "This document contains
   NATO RESTRICTED information not marked for declassification (date of source) and
   shall be safeguarded in accordance with USSAN 1-69".
   4.6.4. Other foreign government classified documents should be marked in English to
   identify the originating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation.
   4.6.5. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that
   equates to RESTRICTED, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided
   to a DOD component, should be marked to identify the originating government and whether
   they are restricted or provided in confidence.
4.7. Audio and Video Tapes. Personnel responsible for marking and maintaining original
classified audio and video tapes that document raw test data do not need to include
footers/headers showing the applicable classification markings. However, the required
classification markings must be placed on the outside of the container and reel. All copies made
from the original tapes must include headers/footers that show the applicable classification
markings. This will help ensure that valuable historical test data is not inadvertently erased
during the classification marking process. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.]
4.8. Removable Information Systems Storage Media. Use SF Form 706, Top Secret ADP
Media Classification Label; SF 707, Secret ADP Media Classification Label; SF Form 708,
Confidential ADP Media Classification Label; SF 710, Unclassified Label, SF Form 711, ADP
Data Descriptor Label, on removable information systems storage media. These are available
through the Air Force Publications Distribution System. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Paragraphs
5-407 and 5-409a-b.]
 32                                          AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


   4.8.1. Many new removable information systems storage media are of size and shape that
   precludes application of the standard forms. Such media storing classified information must
   be permanently marked to display the highest classification of stored information.
   4.8.2. Designated Approving Authorities (DAA) have the authority to impose restrictions
   upon, and prohibit the use of, government owned removable information systems storage
   media for classified systems or networks. DAA approved restrictions will outline clearing, or
   destruction, procedures for unauthorized devices found in areas where classified processing
   takes place. Personally owned information systems storage media are prohibited in areas
   where classified is processed.
   4.8.3. The inherent risk of loss of small storage devices should be considered before using
   them for storing or transporting classified information. Procedures to reduce the potential for
   accidental loss must be included in local operating instructions. Include a review of these
   procedures in the semi-annual self-inspection and ISPRs.
4.9. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.11.]
   4.9.1. See AFI 14-302, Control, Protection, and Dissemination of Sensitive Compartmented
   Information, for Air Force policy on intelligence information.
   4.9.2. The Special Security Office (SSO) is the focal point for release and dissemination of
   SCI. The Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/6, Security Controls on the
   Dissemination of Intelligence Information and DCID 6/7, Intelligence Disclosure Policy
   provide criteria for release of intelligence to foreign officials.
4.10. Authorized for Release To (REL TO) Markings. [Reference DUSD(/)I Memo 27 Sep
2004, subject: Security Classification Marking Instructions.]
   4.10.1. ―REL TO‖ identifies classified information that an originator has predetermined to
   be releasable based on guidance provided by an Air Force specifically designated foreign
   disclosure official or has been released, through established foreign disclosure procedures
   and channels, to the foreign country(ies)/international organizations indicated.
   4.10.2. ―REL TO‖ cannot be used with ―Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals‖ (NOFORN)
   on page markings. When a document contains both NOFORN and REL TO portions,
   NOFORN takes precedence for the markings at the top and bottom of the page.
   4.10.3. The full marking ―REL TO USA//applicable country trigraph(s), international
   organization or coalition force tetragraph‖ shall be used after the classification and will
   appear at the top and bottom of the front cover, if there is one, the title page, if there is one,
   the first page and the outside of the back cover, if there is one. ―REL TO‖ must include
   country code ―USA‖ as the first country code listed. After the USA, country trigraphic code
   shall be listed in alphabetical order followed by international organization/coalition
   tetragraphic codes listed in alphabetical order.
   4.10.4. Country codes shall be separated by a comma and a space with the last country code
   separated by a space, a lower case ―and‖ and a space. EXAMPLE: TOP SECRET//REL TO
   USA, EGY and ISR.
   4.10.5. When portion marking, countries do not need to be listed unless they are different
   from the countries listed in the ―REL TO‖ at the top and bottom of the page. Text that is
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                           33


   releasable to all the countries listed at the top and bottom of the page shall be portion marked
   ―REL‖. EXAMPLE: (TS//REL)
   4.10.6. If the information is releasable to countries that are different than those listed in the
   overall ―REL TO‖ marking, the portion marking has the same format, but with the specific
   countries/organizations listed alphabetically. EXAMPLE: The overall document marking is
   ‗SECRET//REL TO USA, NZL and NATO.‖ However, the portion marking may be:
   (S//REL TO USA, AUS, NZL and NATO) to indicate that information contained in this
   portion is also releasable to Australia.
   4.10.7. ―NOFORN‖ is an authorized control marking for intelligence information IAW
   DCID 6/6, Security Controls on the Dissemination of Intelligence Information. Do not use
   the ―NOFORN‖ dissemination control marking on any document, including derivatively
   classified documents, without first verifying that the requirements of DCID 6/6 are met and
   that the marking is actually warranted.
   4.10.8. Countries represented with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
   3166 trigraphic codes can be obtained from the ISPM or from INTELINK on the SIPRNET.
4.11. Classified Electronic Mail (E-Mail)
   4.11.1. All e-mails and documents accomplished on the SIPRNET, whether classified or
   unclassified, will contain the correct classification markings. Classified information may not
   be transmitted on the NIPRNET.
   4.11.2. The first marking in the Subject line of the e-mail will be the overall classification of
   the e-mail using these symbols: (S) for Secret, (C) for Confidential, and (U) for Unclassified.
   Following this will be the subject title, followed by the classification of the subject title.
   Example: Subject: (S) Unclassified E-Mail Sample (U)
   4.11.3. Do not send classified messages or mark messages as classified on an
   unclassified network.
   4.11.4. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the first
   line of the e-mail message text.
   4.11.5. Begin the text of the message on the third line, leaving a blank line between the
   classification marking and the text.
   4.11.6. All paragraphs and subparagraphs will be marked with the appropriate portion
   marking. Use the abbreviated classification symbol at the beginning of all paragraphs and
   subparagraphs.
   4.11.7. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the last
   line of the e-mail message text.
   4.11.8. All attachments (if any) will be marked appropriately with overall and portion
   markings. Indicate the classification of the attachment by placing the abbreviated
   classification symbol in parentheses before the attachment icon.
   4.11.9. Place classification, declassification, and downgrading instructions after the
   signature block on the left margin.

                                      SAFEGUARDING

Section 5A—Control Measures

5.1. General. Air Force personnel are responsible, both personally and officially, for
safeguarding classified information for which they have access. Collecting, obtaining, recording,
or removing, for any unauthorized use whatsoever, of any sensitive or classified information, is
prohibited.
   5.1.1. Everyone should be aware that advancing technology provides constantly changing
   means to quickly collect and transport information. The introduction of electronic storage or
   transmission devices into areas that store, process, and/or generate classified information
   increases the risk to that information.
   5.1.2. Consult the servicing DAA for specific guidance concerning introduction into areas
   containing Information Systems (IS). [Reference DODD 8100.2, Use of Commercial
   Wireless Devices, Services, and Technologies in the Department of Defense (DOD) Global
   Information Grid (GIG).]

Section 5B—Access

5.2. Granting Access to Classified Information. Personnel who have authorized possession,
knowledge, or control of classified information grant individuals access to classified information
when required for mission essential needs and when the individual has the appropriate clearance
eligibility according to AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management; has signed an SF
312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA), and has a need to know the
information. Those granting access to classified information must gain the originator‘s approval
before releasing the information outside the Executive Branch or as specified by the originator of
the material. Also see paragraph 5.4.1.1 of this AFI. [References DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2., and EO
12958, as amended, Section 4.1(c.)]
   5.2.1. The Secretary of Defense directed all military members and civilian employees with
   Top Secret eligibility or access to a specially controlled access category or compartmented
   information to make a one time verbal attestation to the first paragraph of the SF 312. The
   verbal attestation must be witnessed by at least one individual in addition to the official who
   presides over the attestation and manages the process [Reference DOD 5200.1-PH-1.] The
   procedures for personal attestation include:
       5.2.1.1. The statement, "Attestation completed on (date)," is placed in the bottom of the
       Organization block in Item 11 of the SF 312.
       5.2.1.2. The individual making the verbal attestation will complete Item 11 of the SF
       312. The witness will sign in the Witness block. The presiding official will sign in the
       Acceptance block.
       5.2.1.3. Record the date of attestation in JPAS.
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                         35


   5.2.2. Confirm an individual‘s access level. The holder of the information must confirm
   valid need-to-know and must verify the level of access authorization. Those granting access
   to classified information will confirm a person's access level by:
       5.2.2.1. Checking the person's access level, clearance eligibility, and date the person
       signed the SF 312 and completed Non-SCI Indoctrination, in JPAS; or
       5.2.2.2. Confirming it through the employee's security manager, supervisor, or
       commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief; or
       5.2.2.3. Receiving a visit request from a non-DOD visitor's security manager or
       supervisor. See paragraph 5.5 for further guidance.
   5.2.3. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Security Access Requirement (SAR) Coded Positions.
   Commanders must review manning positions annually in January to determine the need for
   upgrading or downgrading of position coding. The position will be coded to reflect the
   appropriate access level (Secret, Top Secret or SCI) on the unit manning document.
       5.2.3.1. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Requests to upgrade a position code to a ―5‖ (Top
       Secret) must be approved by a 3-star general before a position change can be made.
       Coordinate all upgrade requests through 375 AMW/IPI for review before being sent to
       the Manpower Office (375 FSS/FSM) if military, or if civilian to the Civilian Personnel
       Office (375 FSS/FSMC).
       5.2.3.2. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Requests to downgrade a position code will be sent
       directly to 375 FSS/FSM for military employees or the 375 FSS/FSMC for civilian
       employees.
5.3. Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA). Signing the NdA is a prerequisite for obtaining access
(see paragraph 5.2). Unit commanders or equivalents and staff agency chiefs are responsible for
ensuring their employees have signed one by checking JPAS or the employee‘s personnel
records. If they have not signed one, those responsible use DOD 5200.1-PH-1, Classified
Information Nondisclosure Agreement (Standard Form 312) Briefing Pamphlet, to brief people
on the purpose. Record the NdA on-line through JPAS prior to sending the signed form for
retention. NOTE: When the employee‘s access level is passed to another office or activity, that
office or activity can assume the employee has signed one.
5.3. (SCOTTAFB)Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA). Before having access to classified
information, all personnel will sign an SF 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure
Agreement. Individuals completing the SF 312 for the first time and assigned to a Top Secret or
special access position will complete the security attestation when they read and sign the SF 312.
The original SF 312 will be sent to the appropriate retention address and a copy given to the
member. It is not necessary for the security manager to maintain a copy of the SF 312 once the
original has been forwarded to the retention address and the date of indoctrination and access
level have been entered into JPAS.
   5.3.1. Retention. Security managers mail the NdA to the following organizations who will
   retain the NdAs for 50 years.
   5.3.1. (SCOTTAFB) After annotating the attestation in JPAS, the attestation document
   should be given to the member to present as proof for future assignments or accesses. Copies

        5.4.1.1.1. Gained release approval from the originator or owner of the information.
        Normally, this is the same official identified in paragraph 5.4.1.1.2.2 below.
        5.4.1.1.2. Determined the individual has a current favorable personnel security
        investigation as defined by AFI 31-501 and a check of JPAS and a local files check
        (LFC) shows there is no unfavorable information since the previous clearance. A LFC
        must be processed according to AFI 31-501. EXCEPTION: In cases where there is
        no current personnel security investigation as defined in AFI 31-501,
        MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders and HAF 2-digits may request a National Agency
        Check (NAC) and grant access up to the Secret level before the NAC is complete
        when there is a favorable LFC and the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility
        (AFCAF) confirms there is no unfavorable information on the individual in JPAS.
        When applying this exception, follow the procedures outlined in AFI 31-501,
        paragraph 3.11. for interim security clearance eligibility.
            5.4.1.1.2.1. Authority to grant access to persons outside the Executive Branch

        5.4.1.2.1. The person‘s name, SSAN, date and place of birth, and citizenship.
        5.4.1.2.2. Place of employment.
        5.4.1.2.3. Name and location of installation or activity where the person needs
        access.
        5.4.1.2.4. Level of access required.
        5.4.1.2.5. Subject of information the person will access.
        5.4.1.2.6. Full justification for disclosing classified information to the person.
        5.4.1.2.7. Comments regarding benefit(s) the U.S. Government may expect by
        approving the request.
     5.4.1.3. The authorizing official will coordinate the processing of the NAC request with
     the nearest Air Force authorized requester of investigations.
     5.4.1.4. Individuals with approval must sign an NdA before accessing information. Upon
     completion of access, individuals must sign an AF Form 2587, Security Termination
     Statement.
  5.4.2. Congress. See AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress, for guidance when
  granting classified access to members of Congress, its committees, members, and staff
  representatives. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.1]
  5.4.3. Government Printing Office (GPO). The GPO processes and confirms their
  personnel‘s access. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.2]

  5.4.4. Representatives of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). See AFI 65-401,
  Relations with the General Accounting Office, for access requirements. [Reference DOD
  5200.1-R, C6.2.2.3.]
  5.4.5. Historical Researchers. AFHRA OL-A/HOR is the authority for granting access to
  historical researchers on behalf of the Air Force Historian (HQ USAF/HO). [Reference DOD
  5200.1-R, C6.2.2.4.]
     5.4.5.1. General. Requests for classified access by historical researchers will be
     processed only in exceptional cases wherein extraordinary justification exists. Access
     will be granted to the researcher only if the records cannot be obtained through available
     declassification processes (i.e., the FOIA and MDR processes) and when the access
     clearly supports the interests of national security.
     5.4.5.2. Providing Access.
         5.4.5.2.1. The researcher must apply to AFHRA OL-A/HOR in writing for the
         access. The application will fully describe the project including the sources of
         documentation that the researcher wants to access.
         5.4.5.2.2. If AFHRA OL-A/HOR accepts the request for access, they will provide the
         researcher with written authorization to go to the nearest Air Force installation
         security forces office to complete a personnel security questionnaire for a NAC
         according to AFI 31-501.
         5.4.5.2.3. If the results of the NAC are favorable and AFHRA OL-A/HOR approves
         access, the researcher must sign a SF 312 and an agreement to submit any notes and
         manuscript(s) for security and policy review(AFI 35-101). This process is to ensure
         the documents do not contain any classified information and, if so, determine if they
         can be declassified. Send the SF 312 to AFHRA OL-A/HOR for retention. Classified
         information will not be removed from government facilities.
         5.4.5.2.4. Other Terms.
            5.4.5.2.4.1. The access agreement is valid for two years. One two-year renewal is
            possible. A renewal will not be considered if the project appears to be inactive in
            the months before the end of the original agreement.
            5.4.5.2.4.2. Access will be limited to those records 25 or more years of age.
            5.4.5.2.4.3. Access based on a NAC is valid for Secret and Confidential
            information but does not meet the requirement for access to RD or SAP
            information. Access to Top Secret or SCI information is not authorized.
            5.4.5.2.4.4. Access will be allowed only to Air Force records at AFHSO,
            AFHRA, and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
            5.4.5.2.4.5. Access to Air Force records still in the custody of the originating
            offices in the Washington National Capital Region must be approved in writing
            by the originating offices or their successors. It is the responsibility of the
            researcher to secure this approval.
  5.4.6. Former Presidential Appointees. Persons who previously occupied policy-making
  positions to which the President appointed them may not remove classified information upon
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                         39


   departure from office. All such material must remain under the security control of the U.S.
   Government. Such persons may be authorized access to classified information they
   originated, received, reviewed, signed, or that was addressed to them while serving in their
   official capacity, provided the applicable Air Force OCA: [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
   C6.2.2.5.]
       5.4.6.1. Makes a written determination that such access is clearly consistent with the
       interests of national security;
       5.4.6.2. Uses the same access determination procedures outlined in paragraph 5.4 of
       this AFI;
       5.4.6.3. Limits the access to specific categories of information over which the Air Force
       OCA has classification jurisdiction;
       5.4.6.4. Maintains custody of the information or authorizes access to documents in the
       custody of the NARA; and,
       5.4.6.5. Obtains the individual‘s agreement to safeguard the information and to submit
       any notes and manuscript for a security review (AFI 35-101, Chapter 15) to ensure that
       the documents do not contain classified information or to determine if any classified
       information should be declassified.
   5.4.7. Judicial Proceedings. See AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation, for more information
   regarding the release of classified information in litigation.
   5.4.8. Other Situations. Follow the guidance in paragraph 5.4.1.1 above. [Reference DOD
   5200.1-R, C6.2.2.7.]
   5.4.9. Foreign Nationals, Foreign Governments, and International Organizations. Owners of
   classified information disclose it to foreign nationals, foreign governments, and international
   organizations only when they receive authorization from SAF/IAPD, 1080 Air Force
   Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1080. (See AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of Classified
   and Unclassified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International
   Organizations, for more specific guidance.) See Attachment 4 for guidance on transmitting
   classified information to foreign governments.
   5.4.10. Retired Flag or General Officers or Civilian Equivalent. See AFI 31-501. These
   individuals need not sign a NdA if the original one is already filed in their retired file or
   JPAS. (see paragraph 5.3.1.3).
5.5. Access by Visitors. JPAS is the primary source for confirming access eligibility for DOD
and DOD contractor personnel. Visit authorization letters will not be used to pass security
clearance information unless JPAS is not available. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.3.]
   5.5.1. Outgoing Visit Requests for Air Force Employees. When an Air Force employee
   requires access to classified information at:
       5.5.1.1. A non-DOD contractor activity, the supervisor or security manager contacts the
       office to be visited to determine the desired clearance verification.
       5.5.1.2. A DoE activity, the supervisor or security manager prepares and processes DoE
       Form 5631.20, according to DODD 5210.2, Access to and Dissemination of Restricted
       Data. Also see paragraph 1.5.1 of this AFI.
 40                                         AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


   5.5.2. Incoming Visit Requests. Air Force activity visit hosts serve as the approval authority
   for visits to their activities. Use JPAS to confirm security clearances of DOD personnel,
   including DOD contractors. Installation or activity commanders or equivalents, and staff
   agency chiefs receiving a visit request:
       5.5.2.1. From non-DOD contractors, see DOD 5220.22-M, Chapter 6.
       5.5.2.2. From foreign nationals or U.S. citizens representing a foreign government,
       process the visit request according to AFI 16-201.
5.6. Preventing Public Release of Classified Information. See AFI 35-101, Chapter 15, for
guidance on security reviews to prevent people from publishing classified information in
personal or commercial articles, presentations, theses, books or other products written for general
publication or distribution.
5.7. Access to Information Originating in a Non-DOD Department or Agency. Holders
allow access under the rules of the originating agency.
5.8. Administrative Controls.
   5.8.1. Top Secret. The security of Top Secret material is paramount. Strict compliance with
   Top Secret control procedures take precedence over administrative convenience. These
   procedures ensure stringent need to know rules and security safeguards are applied to our
   most critical and sensitive information. The Air Force accounts for Top Secret material and
   disposes of such administrative records according to WebRims Records Disposition Schedule.
       5.8.1.1. Establishing a Top Secret Control Account (TSCA). Unit commanders or
       equivalents, and staff agency chiefs who routinely originate, store, receive, or dispatch
       Top Secret material establish a Top Secret account and designate a Top Secret Control
       Officer (TSCO), with one or more alternates, to maintain it. The unit commander or staff
       agency chief will notify the installation ISPM of the establishment of TSCAs and the
       names of thE TSCO. The TSCO uses AF Form143, Top Secret Register Page, to account
       for each document (to include page changes and inserts that have not yet been
       incorporated into the basic document) and each piece of material or equipment to include
       IS media. NOTE: For IS information systems or microfiche media, TSCOs must either
       describe each Top Secret document stored on the media on the AF Form 143 or attach a
       list of the documents to it. This will facilitate a damage assessment if the media are lost
       or stolen. EXCEPTIONS:
       5.8.1.1. (SCOTTAFB) Establishing a TSCA. The 375 AMW/IPI will be notified of all
       TSCA within the 375 AMW and applicable tenants. Unit commanders will designate, in
       writing, a primary TSCO with at least one alternate. Appointment memorandums will be
       sent to the 375 AMW/IPI, along with notifications of any designation changes.
           5.8.1.1.1. Top Secret Messages. TSCOs do not use AF Form 143 for Top Secret
           messages kept in telecommunications facilities on a transitory basis for less than 30
           days. Instead, use message delivery registers or other similar records of
           accountability.
           5.8.1.1.2. Defense Courier Service (DCS) Receipts. TSCOs don‘t use AF Forms 143
           as a receipt for information received from or delivered to the DCS. DCS receipts
           suffice for accountability purposes in these cases. Retain as prescribed by WebRims
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                      41


        Records Disposition Schedule. NOTE: TSCOs may automate their accounts as long
        as all of the required information is included in the information system.
     5.8.1.2. Top Secret Disclosure Records.
        5.8.1.2.1. The TSCO uses AF Form 144, Top Secret Access Record and Cover
        Sheet, as the disclosure record and keeps it attached to the applicable Top Secret
        material. Each person that accesses the attached Top Secret information signs the
        form prior to initial access.
        5.8.1.2.2. People assigned to an office that processes large volumes (i.e., several
        hundred documents) of Top Secret material need not record who accesses the
        material. NOTE: This applies only when these offices limit entry to assigned and
        appropriately cleared personnel identified on an access roster.
     5.8.1.3. Top Secret Inventories. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency
     chiefs:
        5.8.1.3.1. Designate officials to conduct annual inventories for all Top Secret
        material in the account and to conduct inventories whenever there is a change in
        TSCOs. These officials must be someone other than the TSCO or alternate TSCOs of
        the TSCA being inventoried. The purpose of the inventory is to ensure all of the Top
        Secret material is accounted for, discrepancies resolved, and its status is correctly
        reflected on the corresponding AF Form 143.
        5.8.1.3.2. Ensure necessary actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified in the
        inventory report.
        5.8.1.3.3. Ensure the inventory report and a record of corrective actions taken are
        maintained with the account.
        5.8.1.3.4. May authorize the annual inventory of Top Secret documents and material
        in repositories, libraries, or activities storing large volumes of Top Secret documents
        and material be limited to a random sampling using the percentage scale indicated
        below. If account discrepancies are discovered the commander or equivalent, or staff
        agency chief must determine if the random sample percentage method will suffice or
        if a higher percentage inventory will be accomplished. If the higher percentage
        inventory is chosen, the inventory percentage will increase by no less than 20 percent.
            5.8.1.3.4.1. One hundred percent, if there are fewer than 300 Top Secret
            documents.
            5.8.1.3.4.2. No less than 90 percent if the holdings range from 301 to 400 Top
            Secret documents.
            5.8.1.3.4.3. No less than 80 percent if the holdings range from 401 to 500 Top
            Secret documents.
            5.8.1.3.4.4. No less than 70 percent if the holdings range from 501 to 600 Top
            Secret documents.
            5.8.1.3.4.5. No less than 60 percent if the holdings range from 601 to 800 Top
            Secret documents.
 42                                        AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


              5.8.1.3.4.6. No less than 50 percent if the holdings range from 801 to 1,000 Top
              Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.7. No less than 40 percent if the holdings range from 1,001 to 1,300 Top
              Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.8. No less than 30 percent if the holdings range from 1,301 to 1,800 Top
              Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.9. No less than 20 percent if the holdings range from 1,801 to 2,800 Top
              Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.10. No less than 10 percent if the holdings exceed 2,800 Top Secret
              documents.
      5.8.1.4. Special Access Programs will follow the inventory and accountability
      requirements prescribed by the AFSAPCO.
      5.8.1.5. Top Secret Receipts. TSCOs use AF Form 143 as a receipt when transferring
      Top Secret material from one TSCO to another on the same installation.
      5.8.1.6. Top Secret Facsimiles. Top Secret facsimiles will be processed as another copy
      of the main Top Secret document in the TSCA. All the same rules apply except the
      register page and disclosure record will be faxed along with the document to the
      addressee. The addressee will sign and return them immediately to the sender for
      inclusion in the TSCA.
   5.8.2. Secret. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs set up procedures for
   internal control of Secret material. When entering Secret material into a mail distribution
   system, a receipt is required. Personnel may use AF Form 310, as a receipt.
   5.8.3. Confidential. Individuals need not use a receipt for Confidential material unless asked
   to do so by the originating activity.
   5.8.4. Foreign Government and NATO Information. See DOD 5200.1-R, C6.6., for
   receipting requirements.
   5.8.5. Retention of Receipts. Retain receipt and other accountability records IAW WebRims
   Records Disposition Schedule.

Section 5C—Safeguarding

5.9. Care During Working Hours.
   5.9.1. Personnel removing classified material from storage must:
      5.9.1.1. For Top Secret material use AF Form 144, instead of SF Form 703, Top Secret
      Cover Sheet (see paragraph 5.8.1.2.1) except as specified in paragraph 5.8.1.2.2
      above. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.2.1.]
      5.9.1.2. For Secret or Confidential material use SF Form 704, Secret Cover Sheet, or SF
      Form 705, Confidential Cover Sheet, as appropriate. These forms are available through
      the Air Force Publications Distribution system.
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                          43


       5.9.1.3. Use the SF Form 702, to record openings and closings for all General Services
       Administration (GSA)-approved security containers, vaults, and approved secure storage
       rooms.
       5.9.1.4. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Ensure the door to the room where classified
       information will be processed remains closed. When working with classified information
       a sign indicating, ―Classified Work In Progress” will be conspicuously posted outside the
       door.
   5.9.2. The nature of the classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault
   may preclude the use of cover sheets. Use cover sheets when feasible.
5.10. End-of-Day Security Checks. Each unit and staff agency that processes, stores, or
generates classified information will conduct an end-of-day security check to ensure classified
material is stored appropriately. Personnel conducting these checks will do so at the close of each
working day and record them on the SF Form 701, when security containers are present, even if
the container was not opened that day. The ―Checked By‖ column of the SF 702 does not require
end-of-day documentation. Activities that are continuously staffed will establish local procedures
to provide for daily security checks. Document those daily security checks on the SF 701. Note:
Additional security and safety checks may be added in the blanks on the SF 701. All security
containers will be listed on the SF 701 for end-of-day checks.
5.10. (SCOTTAFB)End-of-Day Security Checks. It is recommended each unit/staff agency
chief implement a clean desk policy to aid in the accomplishment of the end-of-day check. The
SF 701 will be conspicuously posted in the area of responsibility. The SF 702 will be located on
top of the classified storage container. The SF 702 will be checked and annotated each duty day
the container is opened.
   5.10.1. (Added-SCOTTAFB) The SF 701 and the SF 702 shall be maintained for 3
   months.
   5.10.2. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Personnel authorized/assigned to conduct end-of-day check
   for each unit/staff agency will receive training/briefing by the security manager on the proper
   procedures.
       5.10.2.1. (Added-SCOTTAFB) End-of-day checks should include desktops, file
       baskets, cabinet tops, trash containers, fax machines, etc., for the presence of classified
       materials. Check all reproduction machines and shredders. Check all stand-alone
       Emission Security (EMSEC) approved information systems, secure telephone units
       (STU-III/STE) and any secure data fax machines for proper storage of the crypto ignition
       keys.
   5.10.3. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Before leaving the area, all employees should ensure all
   classified notes, carbon paper, typewriter ribbons, disks, rough drafts, and similar papers are
   placed in storage containers to assist in the end-of-day checks.
   5.10.4. (Added-SCOTTAFB) If personnel discover unattended classified in an area not
   authorized for open storage, they should report it immediately to the unit/staff agency
   security manager. Secure the classified in a unit/staff agency safe or at Command Post until
   the next duty day. The security manager must contact the ISPM the next duty day to report
   the incident.
 44                                        AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


   5.10.5. (Added-SCOTTAFB) For incidents involving COMSEC materials, immediately
   contact the COMSEC manager (375th Communications Squadron) for further guidance.
5.11. Residential Storage Arrangements.
   5.11.1. SECAF and SAF/AA authorize the removal of Top Secret information from
   designated working areas. Requesters send requests through command IP channels to
   SAF/AAP [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.7.1.]
   5.11.2. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders, or their ISPMs approve requests for removing
   Secret and Confidential material from designated work areas during non-duty hours
   [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C63.7.2.]
   5.11.3. Contingency Plans. The written procedures will be developed as required by DOD
   5200.1-R, C6.3.7.3. to include arrangements for notifying the responsible activity to pick up
   the classified container and material in the event something happens to the user [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.4.]
5.12. In-Transit Storage. Installation commanders:
   5.12.1. Provide an overnight repository for classified material. A locally developed
   awareness program ensures operations dispatch, passenger services, base entry controllers,
   and billeting staff are aware of the availability.
   5.12.1. (SCOTTAFB) The Senior Controller, Scott AFB Command Post, (375 AMW/CP),
   Bldg 470, is designated as the agency responsible for the temporary storage of classified
   material for transient personnel. This facility is available on a 24-hour basis and is approved
   to store up to and including Top Secret material. Material will be securely fastened so
   evidence of tampering can be easily detected. Packages will be double-sealed in opaque
   containers and marked with the courier's name, location of stay, and phone number. AF
   Form 310, Document Receipt and Destruction Certificate, must be accomplished when using
   the 375 AMW/CP for transient storage of classified.
   5.12.2. Authorize the storage of Secret and Confidential material on the flightline during in-
   processing for deployment when the material is stored in a standard GSA-approved security
   container and the in-transit area is controlled and located on an Air Force installation.
5.13. Classified Meetings and Conferences [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.8.]
   5.13.1. Classified information at meetings, conferences, symposia, portions or sessions of
   meetings, conferences, etc., during which classified information is to be disseminated shall
   be limited to appropriately cleared U.S. Government or U.S. Government contractor
   locations. Auditoriums, assembly halls, or gymnasiums that are primarily for public
   gatherings at cleared contractor facilities will not be used for a classified meeting at which
   Top Secret or Secret information would be disclosed, even though it is located on a portion
   of the contractor‘s cleared facility [DOD 5220.22-R, Para C1.4.5.1].
   5.13.1. (SCOTTAFB) The facility must afford adequate security against unauthorized
   access physically and against sound emissions. All attendees must have the appropriate
   security clearance and need to know of the information being discussed, as well as having
   signed an SF 312. Establish entry control and perimeter surveillance by posting personnel
   from the sponsoring activity in and around the room or facility as necessary. Personnel
   posted will have the appropriate security clearance and the need to know of the information
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                       45


   being discussed. Personnel posted will ensure the exterior of the facility or hallways
   surrounding the room are kept clear for the duration of the meeting. Security Forces is not
   responsible for this function, but may assist in the review of the unit security plans.
   5.13.2. Facility Approval Authority. Installation commanders or their designees assess the
   need to establish and approve secure conference and classified training facilities. Normally,
   secure conference or classified training facilities are only established at locations where
   frequent classified meetings or forums occur. If such a facility does not openly store
   classified information, secure construction requirements are not mandated. However, if
   installation commanders or their designees determine the local threat and security
   environment dictates more stringent construction requirements, they can use DOD 5200.1-R,
   Appendix 7 as a guide for constructing the facility.
   5.13.2. (SCOTTAFB) The ISPM has been designated to assess the need to set up and
   approve secure conference facilities within the 375 AMW, 932 AW, Air Force Network
   Integration Center (AFNIC), and Air Force Audit Agency.
   5.13.3. Foreign Participation. Hosting officials refer to AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of
   Classified and Unclassified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International
   Organizations, for specific guidance.
   5.13.4. Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) Surveys. Commanders or
   equivalents, and staff agency chiefs or their designees determine to do TSCM surveys based
   on mission sensitivity and threat. See AFI 71-101, Volume 3, The Air Force Technical
   Surveillance Countermeasures Program for additional guidance.
5.14. Protecting Classified Material on Aircraft. Classified material and components are
routinely carried on USAF aircraft. The purpose of this paragraph is to provide minimum
standards for the protection of classified material and components while minimizing the impact
on aircrew operations. The following minimum standards are established to provide cost
effective security of classified material and components and to ensure detection of unauthorized
access.
   5.14.1. Aircraft commanders (owners/users) are responsible for the protection of classified
   material and components aboard their aircraft whether on a DOD facility, at a civilian
   airfield, or when stopping in foreign countries IAW DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C6.3.9.
   Aircraft commanders should consult with the local ISPM or senior security forces
   representative for assistance in complying with these requirements.
   5.14.2. To provide security-in-depth for classified components and material on aircraft, park
   the aircraft in an established restricted area or equivalent if the aircraft is designated
   Protection Level (PL) 1, 2, or 3. Refer to AFI 31-101, Air Force Installation Security
   Program, for details about protection levels.
       5.14.2.1. Lock the aircraft, when possible, using a GSA-approved changeable
       combination padlock (Federal Specification FF-P-110) series available from GSA at 800-
       525-8027, under NSN 5340-00-285-6523 to secure the crew entry door, and/or
       5.14.2.2. Place all removable classified material (e.g., paper documents, floppy disks,
       videotapes) in a storage container secured with a GSA-approved lock. The storage
       container must be a seamless metal (or similar construction) box or one with welded
46                                          AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


     seams and a lockable hinged top secured to the aircraft. Hinges must be either internally
     mounted or welded. Containers installed for storage of weapons may also be used to store
     classified material even if weapons/ammunition are present, provided the criteria listed
     above have been met.
         5.14.2.2.1. Have the aircraft and container checked for tampering every 12 hours. If
         unable to comply with the 12 hours due to crew rest, perform these checks no later
         than 1 hour after official end of crew rest.
         5.14.2.2.2. Zeroize keyed COMSEC equipment as required by AFKAG-1N, Air
         Force Communications Security (COMSEC) Operations.
     5.14.2.3. If the aircraft cannot be locked and is not equipped with a storage container,
     place the removable classified in an approved security container in an authorized U.S.
     facility. Classified components, attached to the aircraft, do not have to be removed.
  5.14.3. To provide security-in-depth for classified components and material on PL 4 or non-
  PL aircraft, park the aircraft in a controlled area. PL 4 and non-PL aircraft should not be
  parked in a restricted area due to use of force limitations.
     5.14.3.1. Lock the aircraft using a GSA-approved changeable combination padlock
     (Federal Specification FF-P-110) series available from GSA under NSN 5340-00-285-
     6523 to secure the crew entry door, and
     5.14.3.2. Secure removable classified material IAW paragraph 5.14.2.2 or 5.14.2.3
  5.14.4. At non-U.S. controlled locations, host nation restricted/controlled areas may be used
  only if all material and components aboard the aircraft have been approved for release to the
  host nation by a cognizant foreign disclosure authority. Material should be secured IAW
  paragraph 5.14.2 for restricted areas and paragraph 5.14.3 for controlled areas.
  5.14.5. If the aircraft cannot be parked in a restricted/controlled area:
     5.14.5.1. Place removable classified material in a storage container and secure the
     container as described in paragraph 5.14.2.2 Lock all aircraft egress points or secure
     them from the inside. Seal the aircraft with tamper proof seals such as evidence tape,
     numerically accountable metal, or plastic seals.
     5.14.5.2. If the aircraft can be locked and sealed but there is no storage container,
     remove all removable classified material and store it in an approved security container in
     an authorized U.S. facility. Classified components (e.g., AAR 47, ALE 47, etc.) may be
     stored in a locked and sealed aircraft.
     5.14.5.3. If the aircraft cannot be locked and sealed and no storage container is available,
     off-load all classified material and components to an approved security container in an
     authorized U.S. facility.
     5.14.5.4. If none of the above criteria can be met, U.S. cleared personnel must provide
     continuous surveillance. Foreign national personnel cleared by their government may be
     used if all material and components aboard the aircraft have been approved for release to
     the host nation by a cognizant foreign disclosure authority.
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                        47


   5.14.6. MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs determine specific risk management security standards for
   weather diverts and in-flight emergencies. Review AFKAG-1N if the classified information
   is COMSEC material.
   5.14.7. If evidence exists of unauthorized entry, initiate a security investigation IAW
   Chapter 9 of this AFI.
5.15. Information Processing Equipment.
   5.15.1. Machines with Copying Capability. For copiers and facsimile machines or any
   machines with copying capability (e.g., microfiche machines), personnel consult their unit
   information manager (3A0X1) to determine if the machines are authorized for copying
   classified, and if so, determine if they retain any latent images when copying classified, and
   how to clear them when they do. Networked copiers present unique security hazards that
   require DAA approval. Also see paragraph 5.24 for reproduction authority [Reference DOD
   5200.1-R, C6.3.10.]
   5.15.1. (SCOTTAFB) The security manager will incorporate unit or staff agency
   certification procedures for classified information processing equipment into the unit‘s
   security OI.
   5.15.2. Protect information system equipment or removable hard disk drive and the
   information system media at the highest security classification processed by the system
   [Reference Air Force Special Security Instruction (AFSSI) 5020, paragraph 2.2.2.]
   5.15.3. For any type of printer with a ribbon that has been used to print classified
   information, personnel remove the ribbon and store it as classified. See DOD 5200.1-R,
   Chapter 6 for storage requirements.
   5.15.4. Used toner cartridges may be treated, handled, stored, and disposed of as
   unclassified, when removed from equipment that has successfully completed its last print
   cycle.
   5.15.5. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Cellular phones, cordless phones, and wireless microphones
   are not allowed in areas where classified information is discussed or processed without
   written approval from the DAA in consultation with the CSA Certified TEMPEST Technical
   Authority (CTTA).
      5.15.5.1. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Wireless technologies (devices) used for storing,
      processing and/or transmitting information will not be operated in areas where classified
      information is electronically stored, processed or transmitted unless approved by the
      DAA in consultation with the CSA CTTA.
5.16. General Safeguarding Policy. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.]

   5.16.4. SCI Safeguarding Policy. See Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 14-304, The Security,
   Use, and Dissemination of Sensitive Compartmented Information (supersedes USAFINTEL
   201-1.)
   5.16.5. Retention of Classified Records. Personnel follow the disposition guidance in
   WebRims Records Disposition Schedule.
5.17. Standards for Storage Equipment. GSA-approved security containers must have a label
stating ―General Services Administration Approved Security Container‖ affixed to the front of
the container usually on the control or top drawer.
   5.17.1. If the label is missing or if the container‘s integrity is in question, the container shall
   be inspected by a GSA certified inspector.
   5.17.1. (SCOTTAFB) The 375 AMW/IPI will provide contact information for GSA
   certified technicians who are authorized to recertify safes. Recertification and maintenance
   of all safes must be funded by the owning unit or staff agency. Lock combination changes
   are not to be accomplished by the locksmith. These changes must be done by the safe
   custodian or individual listed on the SF 700, Security Container Information.
   5.17.2. Organizations without GSA certified inspectors must confirm that contractor
   inspectors have current GSA inspector training certificates prior to allowing them to
   determine the security integrity of GSA-approved containers.
   5.17.3. Information on obtaining inspections and recertification of containers can be found in
   FED-STD         -809A      on      the     DoD       lock       program        website     at:
   (https://portal.navfac.navy.mil/portal/page/portal/navfac/navfac_ww_pp/navfac_nfesc_
   pp/locks) or by calling DSN 312-551-1212.
   5.17.4. Inspecting personnel must note their findings and the source of confirmation on an
   AFTO Form 36, (available on the AFEPL), and retain that record in the container [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.]
   5.17.5. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Storage containers for classified material will be numbered
   by functional address symbols (FAS) and by number (XX-1, XX-2, etc.). The security
   manager will maintain a list of all security containers by number, make, and model, exact
   location of container (building and room number), and the highest level of classified stored
   therein. A copy of the safe location letter will be provided to 375 AMW/IPI for inclusion in
   the unit Information Security Program File. Emergency plans will be posted on the outside
   of the classified storage containers. AFTO Form 36, Maintenance Record for Security Type
   Equipment, will be used for documentation of maintenance done by authorized technicians.
   AFTO Form 36 will not be used to record safe combination changes or in-house visual
   inspections of the safe. Inventory sheets are recommended for all levels of classified
   material being stored. Inventory sheets may be maintained electronically, if desired.
5.18. Storage of Classified Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.]
   5.18.1. Replacement of Combination Locks. Commanders or equivalents, and staff agency
   chiefs must ensure all combination locks on GSA-approved security containers and doors are
   replaced with those meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2740 starting with those storing the
   most sensitive information according to the priority matrix in DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7.
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                       49


  5.18.2. Due to operational necessity or the size and nature of some classified materials, it
  may be necessary to construct secure rooms for storage because GSA-approved containers or
  vaults are unsuitable or impractical. Secure rooms must be approved by the ISPM and be
  constructed IAW DOD 5200.1-R Appendix 7. Access to secure rooms must be controlled to
  preclude unauthorized access. Access shall be limited to authorized persons who have an
  appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know for the classified material/information
  within the area. Persons without the appropriate level of clearance and/or need to know shall
  be escorted at all times by an authorized person where inadvertent or unauthorized exposure
  to classified information cannot otherwise be effectively prevented. The nature of the
  classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault may preclude the use of
  cover sheets.
  5.18.3. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Storing Classified Material for Other Units or Staff
  Agencies. 375 AMW units or staff agencies may store classified material for other units or
  staff agencies when the volume of classified material or frequency of use does not justify
  maintaining a security container. Place the material in a sealed envelope or sealed container
  and mark the envelope or container on front and back with the highest classification of
  material held therein. The owning agency will provide the storing agency a memorandum
  listing names, organizational addresses, telephone numbers, and security clearances of
  personnel authorized access to the envelope or container. The owning agency will review the
  material quarterly. The reviewing official must date and sign a review sheet or log attesting
  the material is still required. Use an AF Form 614, Charge Out Record, when the material is
  temporarily removed. Establish procedures to ensure all classified material is returned to the
  storage container before the end-of-day check.
  5.18.4. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Vaults and Secure Rooms.                The structural standards
  identified in DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7, apply to the 375 AMW and tenant activities. A
  physical security survey will be conducted for all 375 AMW organizations requesting open
  storage of classified information. The survey will be conducted by a team with
  representatives from the Wing Information Security Office, Wing Resource Protection
  Office, Wing Information Assurance Office, and civil engineers, as applicable. The approval
  authority for open storage for the 375 AMW is the ISPM.
     5.18.4.1. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Open Storage Certification and Approval.               The
     following actions are necessary to obtain certification and approval to openly store
     classified materials in vaults or secure rooms. The unit or staff agency requiring the
     secure room or vault ensures that the following actions are accomplished:
         5.18.4.1.1. (Added-SCOTTAFB) The ISPM and civil engineer will review all new
         constructions or structural modifications before construction or compensatory
         measures are included, to ensure the vault or secure room design meets physical
         security standards for Secret or Top Secret storage. A memorandum from the unit
         requesting an inspection will suffice. Once construction or modifications are
         complete, the ISPM and civil engineer will certify, in writing, if the facility does or
         does not meet physical security standards. The unit or staff agency submits a written
         plan or operating instruction outlining procedures for providing protection and
         positive entry control to the vault or secure room. The ISPM will certify the plan or
         OI ensures adequate safeguards for the protection of classified material. The plan is
         then forwarded to the 375 AMW/CC for final review/approval. If the facility meets
 50                                        AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


          standards, no further action is required. Both the unit and the ISPM will keep a copy
          of the certification. Recertification is only required if physical/constructional changes
          are made to the area or storage requirements change. Post open storage
          certification/approval on the inside of the approved open storage area. Note: The
          definition of open storage is material that cannot be stored in a security container due
          to its bulk and/or the facility does not meet the criteria of a vault. Open storage
          certification will not be granted based on convenience alone.
              5.18.4.1.1.1. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Recycle bins and containers should not be
              kept in open storage areas, due to the heightened risk of possible compromise and
              inadvertent disclosure of classified material.          Procedures for recycling
              unclassified materials maintained in open storage areas should be developed and
              identified in unit OI. Material being recycled should be closely monitored to
              ensure classified material has not been commingled.
5.19. Use of Key-Operated Locks [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.3.6.1.]
   5.19.1. The authority to determine the appropriateness of using key-operated locks for
   storage areas containing bulky Secret and Confidential material is delegated to the unit
   commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs having this storage requirement. When
   key-operated locks are used, the authorizing official will designate lock and key custodians.
   5.19.2. Lock and key custodians use AF Form 2427, (available on the AFEPL) to identify
   and keep track of keys.
5.20. Procurement of New Storage Equipment [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.5.]
5.20. (SCOTTAFB)Procurement of New Storage Equipment. New purchases of
combination locks for GSA approved security containers, vault doors, and secure rooms will
conform to Federal Specification FF-L-2740A. If they fail, they will be replaced with a lock
meeting FF-L-2740A. All repairs and equipment for security containers must be funded by the
owning unit or staff agency.
   5.20.1. Requesters of exceptions send their requests through command IP channels to
   SAF/AAP who will then notify USD/I of the exception [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.2.]
   5.20.2. See AFMAN 23-110, Volume II, Standard Base Supply Customer’s Procedures
   [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.2.]

   5.21.1. See AFMAN 14-304 for guidance on marking security containers used to store SCI
   [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.1.]
   5.21.2. Use SF Form 700, Security Container Information (available through the Air
   Force Publications Distribution system), for each vault or secure room door and security
   container, to record the location of the door or container, and the names, home addresses, and
   home telephone numbers of the individuals who are to be contacted if the door or container is
   found open and unattended. Applying classification marking to SF 700, Part 1, is not
   required when separated from Part 2 and 2a.
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                          51


      5.21.2.1. Affix the form to the vault or secure door or to the inside of the locking drawer
      of the security container. Post SF Form 700 to each individual locking drawer of security
      container with more than one locking drawer, if they have different access requirements.
      5.21.2.2. The SF 700 contains Privacy Act information and must be safeguarded from
      casual view, but must be readily identifiable by anyone that finds the facility unsecured.
   5.21.3. When SF Form 700, Part II, is used to record a safe combination, it must be:
      5.21.3.1. Marked with the highest classification level of material stored in the security
      container; and,
      5.21.3.2. Stored in a security container other than the one for which it is being used.
   5.21.4. (Added-SCOTTAFB) Each time a combination is changed; safe custodians will
   perform a visual inspection of the classified security container. Custodians will check for
   worn or damaged parts, loose handles and other deficiencies that could degrade the
   protection standards of the container. A SF 700 will be re-accomplished each time a safe
   combination is changed. Part II of the SF 700 must be accomplished, properly marked, and
   appropriately stored in a separate security container or separately locking drawer.
5.22. Repair of Damaged Security Containers [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.7.]
   5.22.1. Locksmiths or technicians must be GSA certified and either have a favorable NAC or
   must be continuously escorted while they are repairing security containers. See guidance for
   unescorted entry to restricted areas in AFI 31-501.

   updated quarterly on the restricted NSA site.
   5.28.1. (SCOTTAFB) Units or agencies on Scott AFB will provide their own means for
   destroying classified material. Classified shredders may be ordered through normal supply
   channels. Procurement of new shredders will be made from the current NSA Evaluated
   Products List of approved high crosscut paper shredders. SCOTTAFBVA 31-2, Authorized
   For Destruction of Classified Material, or a similar locally created visual aid, will be posted
   on all shredders approved to destroy classified information. SCOTTAFBVA 31-1, Not
   Authorized For Destruction of Classified Material, will be posted on all shredders not
   approved to destroy classified information.
   5.28.2. Records of Destruction Process.
       5.28.2.1. Top Secret. TSCOs will ensure:
          5.28.2.1.1. Two people with Top Secret access are involved in the destruction
          process;
          5.28.2.1.2. Destruction is recorded on one of these forms: AF Form 143; AF Form
          310; or, AF Form 1565, and,
          5.28.2.1.3. The destruction record is attached to the AF Form 143 (used to account
          for the document) when the destruction is not recorded on the AF Form 143 itself.
       5.28.2.2. Secret and Confidential. A record of destruction is not required. A cleared
       person must perform the destruction.

                        TRANSMISSION AND TRANSPORTATION

Section 6A—Methods of Transmission or Transportation

6.1. General Policy.
   6.1.1. Hand carrying Classified Material During Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel. Hand
   carrying classified material during TDY poses a risk and should be done as a last resort in
   critical situations. Whenever possible, personnel will use standard secure methods for
   relaying the data, e.g., mail through secure channels or through approved secure electronic
   means. Authorizing officials must assess the risk before authorizing the hand carrying of
   classified material. Some factors to consider during the risk assessment process are:
       6.1.1.1. The environment in which the material will be handcarried. Consider the
       chances of the material being confiscated by unauthorized personnel. The servicing
       AFOSI office should be able to assist in determining the risks associated with the
       environment.
       6.1.1.2. The sensitivity of the information. Consider the damage it could cause the
       United States if the information was compromised.
       6.1.1.3. The availability of authorized facilities for storing the classified during overnight
       layovers, at the TDY location, etc. Consider storing the material at a U.S. military
       installation or other government facility.
   6.1.2. Laptop Computers are High Risk. Because of their commercial value, laptop
   computers are an especially high risk when used to transport classified information. When
   using laptops to handcarry classified information, couriers must ensure both laptop and disks
   are prepared according to paragraph 6.6.3 In addition, as required for all classified material,
   couriers must take special care to ensure laptops and disks are kept under constant
   surveillance or in secure facilities/containers at all times.
   6.1.3. Air Force Office of Primary Responsibility for Transmission and Transportation
   Policy. SAF/AAP establishes Air Force policy and procedures for transmission and
   transportation of classified information and material [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
   6.1.4. Transmitting Classified Material by Pneumatic Tube Systems. Installation
   commanders approve the use of pneumatic tube systems and ensure that the equipment and
   procedures provide adequate security [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
   6.1.5. Electronic Transmission and Physical Transportation of COMSEC Material. Personnel
   may acquire information on electronic transmission and physical transportation of COMSEC
   information and material from their supporting COMSEC manager. (Reference AFI 33-201,
   AFI 33-211, AFI33-275, and DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.2.]
   6.1.6. Releasing Other Agency Information Outside of the DoD. Personnel go direct to
   owners of other agency information to request permission to release the information outside
   the DoD [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.4.]
 56                                        AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


   6.1.7. (Added-SCOTTAFB) The Document Security Section (375 CS/SCOK) personnel
   are authorized to open the inner wrappers of classified items insufficiently addressed to Scott
   AFB agencies in order to determine direct distribution. Exception: Items addressed to the
   base COMSEC, 375 CS/SCPNC or CA6XXXXX will not be opened. Call (618) 256-9033
   or DSN 576-9033 for pick up.
6.2. Transmission and Transporting Top Secret Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C7.1.2.]
   6.2.1. Electronic Means. Obtain information about transmitting Top Secret information via
   electronic means from their Information Assurance office. See paragraph 5.8 [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.2.2.]
   6.2.2. DOD Component Courier Service. The Air Force does not have its own courier
   service [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.2.4.]
   6.2.3. Department of State Diplomatic Courier Service. Personnel who need to transport
   classified material use the Department of State courier system when: [Reference DOD
   5200.1-R C7.1.2.5.]

      States or any foreign country that may inspect it.
      6.2.3.2. Transporting Top Secret material to an installation serviced by diplomatic
      pouch. Personnel can find out if they are serviced by diplomatic pouch through their local
      military postal office.
6.3. Transmitting and Transporting Secret Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C7.1.3.]
   6.3.1. Also see AFI 31-601 [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.2.]
   6.3.2. The Air Force authorizes the use of the current holder of the GSA contract for
   overnight delivery of Secret information in urgent cases and when the delivery is between
   DOD Components and their cleared contractor facilities within the United States and its
   Territories. This applies to locations in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico when overnight
   delivery is possible. USD/I has already ensured the conditions cited in DOD 5200.1-R,
   paragraph C7.1.3.3, have been met [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.3.]
      6.3.2.1. The Defense Security Service maintains a list of authorized GSA contract
      overnight delivery services at http://www.dss.mil/isec/approved_overnight.htm.
      6.3.2.2. The carriers identified on the DSS list may be used for urgent overnight delivery
      of Secret and Confidential material within the continental United States (CONUS) when
      overnight delivery cannot reasonably be accomplished by the U.S. Postal Service.
      However, classified COMSEC information may not be transmitted overnight. Controlled
      Cryptographic Information (CCI) that is unclassified may be shipped overnight.
      6.3.2.3. Carrier personnel should not be notified that the package contains classified
      material.
      6.3.2.4. Packages are typically shipped on Monday through Thursday only. This ensures
      that the package does not remain in the possession of the carrier service over a weekend.
      However, the security manager may approve shipment on other days providing the
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                        57


      receiver has appropriate procedures in place. These procedures must ensure that a cleared
      person will receive and sign for the package on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays, and that
      he or she is able to secure the package in approved storage. [DOD 4525.8-M.]
      6.3.2.5. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized person will be available
      to receive the delivery and for verification of the correct mailing address.

individual is off duty and not involved with the transportation or escort of classified material.
Individuals who serve in an ―on-call‖ capacity, such as a duty officer, may be considered on
duty. The DD Form 2501 will be issued with a specific expiration date of not more than 1 year
from the date of issue. Whenever the authorized individual is no longer assigned to or employed
by the issuing organization, the respective DD Form 2501 is invalidated and retained in the
issuing organization‘s file for an additional 2 years before destruction. Classified material hand-
carried outside a facility must be in an envelope, folder or other closed container to prevent loss
or observation of the classified material being hand-carried. An Optional Form 65-B,
Government Messenger Envelope, is not considered a closed container. An appropriate
classified cover sheet can be used when hand-carrying classified material between different units
and agencies within the same building. Note: The authorization for hand-carrying or escorting
classified material outside the local area consists of an approved courier letter and an exemption
notice affixed to the package containing classified.

      ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL COMPROMISE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

9.1. Policy. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C10.]
   9.1.1. It is Air Force policy that security incidents will be thoroughly investigated to
   minimize any possible damage to national security. The investigation will identify
   appropriate corrective actions that will be immediately implemented to prevent future
   security incidents. Further, if the security incident leads to the actual or potential compromise
   of classified information, a damage assessment will be conducted to judge the effect that the
   compromise has on national security.
   9.1.2. Suspected instances of unauthorized public disclosure of classified information shall
   be reported promptly and investigated to determine the nature and circumstances of the
   suspected disclosure, the extent of the damage to national security, and the corrective and
   disciplinary action to be taken [DODD 5210.50, Para 4.]
9.2. Definitions.
   9.2.1. Security incidents as used in this AFI pertain to any security violation or infraction as
   defined in EO 12958, as amended. Security incidents may be categorized as:
       9.2.1.1. Security Violation. Any knowing, willful or negligent action:
           9.2.1.1.1. That could reasonably be expected to result in an unauthorized disclosure
           of classified information.
           9.2.1.1.2. To classify or continue the classification of information contrary to the
           requirements of this order or its implementing directives.
           9.2.1.1.3. To create or continue a SAP contrary to the requirements of EO 12958, as
           amended.
       9.2.1.2. Security Infraction. Any knowing, willful or negligent action contrary to the
       requirements of EO 12958, as amended that is not a security violation.
   9.2.2. A compromise of classified information occurs when unauthorized individuals have
   had access to the classified information. Unauthorized individuals include those individuals
   with the appropriate security clearance but do not have a valid need-to-know.
   9.2.3. A potential compromise of classified information is when an investigating official
   concludes that a compromise of classified information has more than likely occurred as a
   result of a security incident.
9.3. Information System (IS) Deviations. Coordinate all security deviations involving
information systems with the local ISPM and the supporting information assurance office to
begin an evaluation on the impact of the incident to national security and the organization‘s
operations. If COMSEC material is involved, refer to AFI 33-212, Reporting COMSEC
Deviations (will be incorporated in AFI 33-201, Volume 3, COMSEC User Requirements)).

   9.6.1. Classify security incident notices, appointment of inquiry official memorandums, and
   security incident reports at the same level of classification as the information compromised if
   they contain classified information or if they provide sufficient information that would enable
   unauthorized individuals to access the classified information in an unsecured environment. In
   the latter case, the documentation must remain classified until the information has been
   retrieved and appropriately safeguarded. Do not classify memorandums and reports
   pertaining to security incidents that have occurred in the information system environment
   when the system has been appropriately purged and the correspondence does not contain
   other classified information.
       9.6.1.1. Classify security incident notices, memorandums, and reports according to the
       classified source from which they are derived. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 3.

       9.9.1.1. When security incidents occur because of unauthorized transmission of
       classified material, the sending activity appoints the inquiry official and conducts the
       inquiry.
       9.9.1.2. Inquiry officials will coordinate their actions with the servicing ISPM and the
       staff judge advocate‘s office.
       9.9.1.2. (SCOTTAFB) The inquiry official is responsible for obtaining a responsibility
       briefing from 375 AMW/IPI and a legal briefing from the Staff Judge Advocate (375
       AMW/JA) prior to initiating the preliminary inquiry.
   9.9.2. The preliminary inquiry will determine if classified material was compromised, the
   extent of the compromise, and the circumstances surrounding the compromise.
   9.9.3. A preliminary inquiry report will be completed using the sample report format at
   Attachment 6 and submitted to the appointing official through the ISPM. The ISPM will
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                        73


  provide their concurrence/ non concurrence with the report and forward it to the appointing
  official for action. Refer to paragraph 9.6 of this AFI for report classification requirements.
     9.9.3.1. (Added-SCOTTAFB) The appointing authority will make the final
     determination to close the investigation or make the determination to proceed with a
     formal investigation. The final report with the request closure letter will be forwarded to
     375 AMW/IPI for file.
  9.9.4. The report from the preliminary inquiry will be sufficient to resolve the security
  incident if:
     9.9.4.1. The inquiry determines that loss or compromise of classified information has not
     occurred.
     9.9.4.2. The inquiry determines that loss or compromise of classified information has
     occurred, but there is no indication of significant security weakness.
     9.9.4.3. The appointing official determines that no additional information will be
     obtained by conducting a formal investigation.
  9.9.5. If the report from the preliminary inquiry is not sufficient to resolve the security
  incident, the appointing authority initiates a formal investigation. The preliminary inquiry
  report will become part of any formal investigation. If the inquiry is closed out as a
  compromise or potential compromise the appointing authority notifies the OCA to perform a
  damage assessment.
  9.9.6. If the inquiry reveals suspected unauthorized disclosure to the public notify SAF/AAP
  through IP channels [DODD5210.50, Para 5.2.1.]. Classify security incident notices,
  memorandums, and reports according to the classified source from which they are derived.
  Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 3. Specifically address:
     9.9.6.1. When, where, and how the incident occurred.
     9.9.6.2. Was classified information compromised?
     9.9.6.3. If compromise occurred, what specific classified information and/or material
     was involved?
     9.9.6.4. If classified information is alleged to have been lost, what steps were taken to
     locate the material?
     9.9.6.5. In what specific media article or program did the classified information appear?
     9.9.6.6. To what extent was the compromised information disseminated?
     9.9.6.7. Was the information properly classified?
     9.9.6.8. Was the information officially released?
     9.9.6.9. Are there any leads to be investigated that might lead to the identification of the
     person responsible for the compromise?
     9.9.6.10. Will further inquiry increase the damage caused by the compromise?
  9.9.7. Submit a completed Department of Justice (DoJ) Media leak Questionnaire, available
  from https://wwwmil.lackland.af.mil/afsf/ through ISPM channels to USD(I), who will

   coordinate with DOD General Counsel to determine whether a referral to the DoJ for
   prosecution is warranted.
9.10. Damage Assessment.
   9.10.1. A damage assessment is an analysis to determine the effect of a compromise of
   classified information on the national security. It will be initiated by the OCA upon
   notification of a potential or actual compromise to verify and reevaluate the information
   involved. Damage assessment reports will be classified and marked according to the
   classification guidance provided on the information being addressed in the reports.
   9.10.2. The OCA must:
      9.10.2.1. Verify the classification and duration of classification initially assigned to the
      information. If the OCA determines the information should be declassified, the reporting
      activity will be notified.
      9.10.2.2. Set up damage assessment controls and procedures.
      9.10.2.3. Provide a copy of the damage assessment to the inquiry or investigating
      official.
9.11. Formal Investigation.
   9.11.1. A formal investigation is a detailed examination of evidence to determine the extent
   and seriousness of the compromise of classified information. The formal investigation will
   fix responsibility for any disregard (deliberate or inadvertent) of governing directives which
   led to the security incident.
   9.11.2. The commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief of the activity responsible for the
   security incident, will appoint an investigative official to conduct an investigation.
      9.11.2.1. The appointment letter provides authority to conduct an investigation, swear
      witnesses, and examine/copy documents, files and other data relevant to the inquiry.
      9.11.2.2. The investigative official is the personal representative of the Appointing
      Authority and/ or the Commander. The investigative official must be impartial, unbiased,
      objective, thorough, and available.
      9.11.2.3. The investigative official must be a commissioned officer, senior NCO (E-7
      and above), or a civil service employee equivalent (GS-9 and above).
      9.11.2.4. The investigation will be the investigative official‘s only duty (unless the
      Appointing Authority determines otherwise) until the report is completed and approved
      by the Appointing Authority.
      9.11.2.5. Appointing Authorities will not appoint an investigative official who is retiring,
      separating, or being reassigned within 180 days.
   9.11.3. The formal investigation will include the preliminary inquiry if one has been
   conducted.
9.12. Management and Oversight.
   9.12.1. The inquiry/investigative official will route the completed report through the
   servicing ISPM for review before forwarding it to the appointing authority.
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                     75


   9.12.2. The appointing authority will:
      9.12.2.1. Close the inquiry/investigation unless MAJCOM/FOA/DRU directives indicate
      otherwise.
      9.12.2.2. Determine if administrative or disciplinary action is appropriate. See AFI 31-
      501, Chapter 8 and applicable military and civilian personnel publications.

                   CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION

A2.1. For Official Use Only (FOUO). FOUO is a designation that is applied to unclassified
information that is exempt from automatic release to the public under FOIA. See DOD 5400.7-
R/AF Supplement for further guidance [Ref: DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 3, Para AP3.2.]
   A2.1.1. Access to FOUO Information.
      A2.1.1.1. No person may have access to information designated as FOUO unless that
      person has been determined to have a valid need for such access in connection with the
      accomplishment of a lawful and authorized Government purpose.
      A2.1.1.2. The final responsibility for determining whether an individual has a valid need
      for access to information designated as FOUO rests with the individual who has
      authorized possession, knowledge or control of the information and not on the
      prospective recipient.
      A2.1.1.3. Information designated as FOUO may be disseminated within the DOD
      Components and between officials of DOD Components and DOD contractors,
      consultants, and grantees to conduct official business for the DOD, provided that
      dissemination is not further controlled by a Distribution Statement.
      A2.1.1.4. DOD holders of information designated as FOUO are authorized to convey
      such information to officials in other Departments and Agencies of the Executive and
      Judicial Branches to fulfill a government function. If the information is covered by the
      Privacy Act, disclosure is only authorized if the requirements of AFI 33-332, Air Force
      Privacy Program, are satisfied.
      A2.1.1.5. Release of FOUO information to Congress is governed by AFI 90-401, Air
      Force Relations With Congress. If the Privacy Act covers the information, disclosure is
      authorized if the requirements of DOD 5400.11-R are also satisfied.
      A2.1.1.6. DOD Directive 7650.01, General Accounting Office (GAO) and Comptroller
      General Access to Records, governs release of FOUO information to the Government
      Accountability Office (GAO). If the Privacy Act covers the information, disclosure is
      authorized if the requirements of DOD 5400.11-R are also satisfied.
   A2.1.2. Protection of FOUO Information.
      A2.1.2.1. During working hours, reasonable steps shall be taken to minimize risk of
      access by unauthorized personnel. After working hours, store FOUO information in
      unlocked containers, desks or cabinets if Government or Government-contract building
      security is provided. If such building security is not provided, store the information in
      locked desks, file cabinets, bookcases, locked rooms, etc.
      A2.1.2.2. FOUO information and material may be transmitted via first class mail, parcel
      post or, for bulk shipments, via fourth-class mail. Electronic transmission of FOUO
      information, e.g., voice, data or facsimile, e-mail, shall be by approved secure
      communications systems or systems utilizing access controls such as Public Key
      Infrastructure (PKI), whenever practical.

     A2.1.2.3. FOUO information may only be posted to DOD Web sites consistent with
     security and access requirements specified in Deputy Secretary of Defense
     Memorandum, dated 25 November 1998, Subject: ―Web Site Administration‖ .
     A2.1.2.4. Record copies of FOUO documents shall be disposed of according to the
     Federal Records Act and the DOD Component records management directives. Non-
     record FOUO documents may be destroyed by any of the means approved for the
     destruction of classified information, or by any other means that would make it difficult
     to recognize or reconstruct the information.
  A2.1.3. Unauthorized Disclosure. The unauthorized disclosure of FOUO does not constitute
  an unauthorized disclosure of DOD information classified for security purposes. However,
  appropriate administrative action shall be taken to fix responsibility for unauthorized
  disclosure of FOUO whenever feasible, and appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken
  against those responsible. Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO information that is protected by
  the Privacy Act may also result in civil and criminal sanctions against responsible persons.
  The Military Department or other DOD Component that originated the FOUO information
  shall be informed of its unauthorized disclosure.

  A2.2.1. Law Enforcement Sensitive is a marking sometimes applied, in addition
  to/conjunction with the marking FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, by the Department of Justice
  and other activities in the law enforcement community. It is intended to denote that the
  information was compiled for law enforcement purposes and should be afforded appropriate
  security in order to protect certain legitimate government interests, including the protection
  of: enforcement proceedings; the right of a person to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;
  grand jury information; personal privacy including records about individuals requiring
  protection under the Privacy Act; the identity of a confidential source, including a State,
  Local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information
  on a confidential basis; information furnished by a confidential source; proprietary

 118                                         AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


access to any element of classified information rests with each individual who has authorized
possession, knowledge or control of the information involved. This determination will be based
upon possession of a valid security clearance at or above the level of classified information
involved, need to know (whether the individual‘s official duties require access to the classified
information) and validation of a signed SF 312, Nondisclosure Agreement, on file. No person
may have access to classified information unless that person has been determined to be
trustworthy and unless access is essential to the accomplishment of lawful and authorized
government purposes, that is, the person has the appropriate security clearance and a need-to-
know. Security reference manuals are maintained by the security manager and are available for
use by all personnel.
4.2. Top Secret information, originated within the Department of Defense (DOD):
A14.4.2.1. Top secret information originating outside the DOD may not be disseminated outside
the DOD without the consent of the originating DOD component, or higher authority. Secret and
confidential information, originating within the DOD, may be disseminated within the executive
branch, unless prohibited by the originator. Each office originating or receiving top secret
information shall maintain top secret accountability registers. Such registers shall be retained for
2 years. Each DOD component for controlling Secret information shall establish administrative
procedures and material originated or received by an activity, distributed or routed to a sub
element of such activity and disposed of by the activity by transfer of custody or destruction.

security manager or the classifier of the information to bring about any necessary correction.
Challenges needed shall be acted upon with 30 days of receipt.
6.1. Handling, Transfer, and Transmission of Classified:
A14.6.1.1. Transmission of classified material is defined in AFI 31-401. Transmission of
classified material can be in the form of mailing, electrical transmission and hand carrying.
Procedures are established as follows (TMO will adhere to procedures outlined in applicable
Transportation regulations and instructions for surface and air movement):
6.2. Mailing Classified Material:
A14.6.2.1. Documents will be placed in two opaque envelopes. ―SECRET‖ material will be
accompanied with an AF IMT 310, Document Receipt and Destruction Certificate. The AF
IMT 310 will be placed in the inner envelope with the document. The last copy of the AF IMT
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                           119


310 will be kept on file. The inner envelope will be sealed using high-grade paper tape (brown)
on all seams and completely covering the flap of the envelope. Once this is done, the envelope
will have the return address and control number of the document affixed to the top left-hand
corner of the envelope. Stamp and mark the classification on the inner envelope, top and bottom,
front and back. Place the envelope in another opaque envelope and address and seal it in the
same manner as the inner envelope. DO NOT PUT THE CLASSIFICATION ON THE
OUTER ENVELOPE. Prepare an AF IMT 12, Accountable Container Receipt, to initiate
registered mailing through the postal channels. The AF Form 12 must accompany the package to
the mailroom. Classified materials sent via postal system will not be addressed to a specific
individual.
6.2.2. Confidential documents mailed off base will be packed in the same manner as secret
material. It is not necessary to use an AF IMT 310. On the outer envelope, place the notation
―Return Service Requested.‖ The outer envelope will not be marked with the classification. For
this organization, confidential and secret documents will not be sent through the Official Mail
Center (formerly the Base Information Transfer Center). If there is material to be picked up by
another activity, they will be notified by telephone.
6.3. Hand-carrying or Escorting Classified Information Off Base:
A14.6.3.1. To hand-carry or escort classified information off base, a letter designating an
individual as an ―official courier‖ is required. You are required to read this guidance before
initiating action for official courier.
6.4. Removing Classified Information from a Building:
6.4.1. Procedures for removing classified material from the confines of Building XXX, Room
XXX are as follows:
6.4.2. Ensure documents are marked with the correct classification.
6.4.3. Use proper cover sheet to cover document front and back.
6.4.4. Place material in an unmarked envelope or folder.
6.4.5. Retain envelope or folder in your possession at all times until placed back in safe or
destroyed.
6.5. Transmission of DOD Classified Material via Federal Express (FedEx):
A14.6.5.1. FedEx shall be used only when it is the most cost effective way to meet a program
requirement, given time, security and accountability restraints. FedEx may be used for the
transmission of secret and confidential material only within the Continental United States
(CONUS). To ensure direct delivery to the addressee, the release signature, block #7, on the
FedEx Airbill Label may not be executed under any circumstances. The secret and/or
confidential material must meet FedEx standard size and weight limitations. Packages should be
shipped via FedEx only on Mondays through Thursdays to ensure FedEx does not have
possession of a package over a weekend. Any problems encountered with the use of FedEx for
the transmission of secret and confidential material are to be reported to this office as soon as
possible. The DOD has authorized the transmission of DOD classified material via GSA
contract Carrier, FedEx. Activity Distribution Offices and Action Offices who receive packages
from FedEx should handle them as if they contained classified material; i.e., if the package is
passed from one individual/office to another, signature control using an AF IMT 12 will be
 120                                         AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


necessary as it will not be known if the package contains classified material. Additionally, these
packages cannot be left unattended.
7.1. Reproducing Classified:
A14.7.1.1. Reproduction of classified material will be kept to a minimum. The OPR will be
consulted prior to reproducing classified material and will designate an approved reproduction
facility. Reproduction authority and persons designated to copy classified material on approved
copier will establish unit procedures for reproduction of classified information and identify
reproduction limitations, if any, for the material. Individuals will reproduce only the minimum
amount of classified needed to support user requirements or file.
7.1.2. All personnel must be continually alert to unauthorized reproduction of classified
material. If unauthorized reproduction of classified material is detected, the security manager
must be notified immediately.
7.1.3. The following procedures apply to reproduction of classified material using the office
copier:
7.1.3.1. Classified reproduction rules will be conspicuously displayed over or near the copier.
7.1.3.2. The copier itself will be treated as if it contains classified latent images until a minimum
of three new copying sequences of blank sheets have been processed through the copier machine
as a preventive measure against latent image retention on the machine‘s memory.
7.1.3.3. No service technicians will have access until the above procedures have been
accomplished. Also inspect machine for any miss-fed originals or copies that may exist in the
machine.
7.1.3.4. All reproduced copies will be afforded the same protection as the original document(s).
8.1. Derivative Classification Authority:
8.1.1. Within DOD, all cleared personnel can perform derivative classification. Derivative
application of classification markings is a responsibility of all assigned personnel who
incorporate, paraphrase, restate or generate in new form information that is already classified or
those who apply markings according to Original Classification Authority guidance.
9.1. Marking Classified:
9.1.1. The originator of classified information is responsible for proper application of
classification markings. The ultimate responsibility rests with the approver or signer of the
document or material.
9.1.2. Those who prepare classified information are strongly encouraged to consult with their
respective security manager and review DOD 5200.1R, Chapter 5, and DOD 5200.1PH, A Guide
to Marking Classified Documents. Refer complex marking issues to the Security Manager for
assistance.
10.1. Maintenance of Security Containers:
10.1.1. For each authorized security container, an SF 700, Security Container Information, is
kept as a record of personnel to notify in the event the security of the material enclosed is
affected. The SF 700 will be posted inside the locking drawer of the safe. A new date will be
entered in the ―date of last combination change‖ block on the SF 700 each time the combination
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                            121


of the container is changed. Part 2 of the SF 700 must be re-accomplished each time the
combination is changed. Events that may cause the combination to be changed are:
10.1.1.1. Container is initially placed in use.
10.1.1.2. An individual aware of the combination no longer requires access to the container (or
is reassigned).
10.1.1.3. A security incident/possible compromise involving the security container (i.e.
container was found opened and material inside suspected as being compromised).
10.1.1.4. Container is taken out of service; lock will be set to 50-25-50.
10.1.1.5. If NATO material is contained within the safe, the combination must be changed
annually.
10.2. If a need to change the combination arises, contact the unit security manager.
10.3. A record of maintenance on the security container is very important. All maintenance
performed on the container by authorized personnel and safe technicians must be annotated on
AFTO Form 36, Maintenance Record for Security Type Equipment. This form must be
maintained in the locking drawer of the classified storage container. Retain the AFTO Form 36
in the classified storage container for the life of the safe. Note: This form is not to annotate
combination changes or in-house visual inspections.
11.1. Safekeeping and Storage of Classified:
11.1.1. The person(s) listed on the SF 700, Security Container Information, are considered
safe custodians. A safe custodian:
11.1.1.1. Complies with the restrictions on the use of classified storage containers.
11.1.1.2. Reports containers that malfunction to the security manager who will prepare
appropriate paperwork to affect required repairs.
11.1.1.3. Ensures the contents of classified storage containers are identified in file plans.
Personal ―work files‖ of classified information are strongly discouraged but not prohibited.
When necessary, these work files should be limited to specifically labeled folders and stored
separately from the contents identified in the file plan.
11.1.2. Clean Desk Policy: All individuals performing classified work will maintain a ―clean
desk‖ office environment. At the end of the duty day, all classified material used that day will be
collected or turned in for storage in the appropriate container. Before locking the container, the
security manager or designated individuals will double check with all offices to ensure no
classified material was overlooked; this includes a cursory check of trash receptacles and
shredder destruction areas. After all material has been gathered, material to be returned to the
user the next duty day will be placed in the individual‘s ―classified folder‖ and place in the back
of the safe. At no time will classified material be taken home.
11.1.3. After all material is in the classified storage container, it will be locked and the SF 702,
Security Container Check Sheet, will be annotated with the time locked and the individual‘s
initials. After locking is complete, another individual will check to ensure it is locked and then
annotate the SF 702 in the ―checked by‖ column. Once this action is complete, the
―OPEN/CLOSED‖ sign will be placed in the ―CLOSED‖ position.

11.1.4. Only materials classified as ―SECRET‖ and ―CONFIDENTIAL‖ are authorized for
storage in the classified storage container.
11.1.5. Only personnel authorized in writing by the commander and on file with the squadron
security manager are authorized to remove and return classified material from the safe or vault.
Storage of any other material such as money, jewelry, weapons and hand-held radios is not
authorized in the safe.
11.1.6. Storing of NATO Material: Refer to unit OI or the NATO directives.
11.1.7. Storage of Any Other Classified Special Access Required Material: Consult the security
authority for the Special Access Required (SAR) program on unique access and storage
requirements. These SAR matters can vary from program to program.
12.1. End-of-Day Security Checks:
12.1.1. Security checks shall be performed at the close of each working day to ensure that the
area is secure. This is accomplished on SF 701, Activity Security Checklist. The storage of
classified material in containers shall be secured on SF 702, Security Container Check Sheet.
Implementing a ―Clean Desk Policy‖ will greatly assist in accomplishing the end-of-day security
checks.
13.1. Disposal and Destruction of Classified Information:
13.1.1. As soon as classified material has served its intended purpose, it should be processed for
destruction. Destruction should be accomplished on a monthly basis to preclude the
accumulation of unneeded material.
13.1.2. Retaining Classified Material Over 10 Years Old: Classified documents that are not
permanently valuable records of the government shall not be retained more than 10 years from
the date of origin, unless such retention is authorized by and in accordance with record
disposition schedules.
13.1.3. Destruction Records: Destruction records and imposition of a two-person rule, that is,
having two cleared persons involved in the entire destruction process, will satisfy this
requirement for Top Secret information. For the destruction of Secret and Confidential
information, a record of destruction is not required, but an appropriately cleared person must be
involved in the destruction process.
13.1.4. The semi-annual clean out dates is the first Fridays in February and August. Units can
add additional clean out dates as needed.
14.1. Security Incidents and Violations:
14.1.1. Anyone who knows or believes that there may have been a compromise, loss,
unauthorized disclosure or other infraction affecting the safeguarding of classified information
must report it without delay to the ISPM.
14.1.2. Appointing Investigation Officials: The commander/director who has responsibility for
the area where the information security incident occurred appoints an investigator to conduct an
investigation of information security incidents.
14.1.3. Briefing Requirements: 375 SFS/S5I briefs the person appointed to conduct the
investigation. During these briefings, the investigator is provided other technical guidance, such
AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008                                                          123


as consulting the local Staff Judge Advocate‘s office for legal guidance.
15.1. Emergency Protection Plan:
A14.15.1.1. This outlines procedures for removal and protection of classified material in 375
XXX/XX, Safe Number XX-1, Building XXX, Room XX and the vault located in 375 XXX/XX,
Building XXX. This instruction implements procedures outlined in AFI 31-401 and pertains to
all individuals who have access to the listed safe.
15.1.2. Responsibilities:
15.1.2.1. The Emergency Protection Plan is for planning purposes only, until activated by the
Squadron Commander or Unit Security Manager. Once an Emergency Plan is established, the
procedures will be briefed to all office staff and a copy placed in close proximity of the security
container.
15.1.3. Procedures:
15.1.3.1. Classified material maintained by the squadron is classified no higher than ―SECRET‖
and is normally originated by higher authority. A very limited file is maintained. The following
information should be implemented in case of fire, natural disaster or civil disturbance.
15.1.3.2. In case of fire, time permitting, hand-carry small, classified cargo out of the building.
If cargo is in the vault, secure the vault door. Small items will be hand carried to building XXX
and secured in XXXX. In building XXX, time permitting, the custodian will remove the
material and take custody of it during building evacuation. Material will be transported to
building XXX, (office symbol), and secured in the classified storage container.
15.1.3.3. If a civil defense alert signal (3-5 minute steady-tone siren) is sounded or flooding
occurs, all classified material must be removed from the immediate work area and secured in the
appropriate security container as long as time permits.
15.1.4. Removal:
15.1.4.1. When removed, documents will be placed into a large envelope or container, marked
with the security classification, office symbol, building and room number, sealed and hand
carried to (office symbol, building XXX).
15.1.4.2. In case of civil disturbance or terrorist/enemy action, secure all classified material in
the appropriate security container. When an analysis presents evidence that classified documents
may fall into unfriendly hands, consideration will be made to determine time allotment for
destruction of documents by shredding or emergency burning.
16.1. Address unit specific items/program that requires protection.
16.l.1. STU-III Protection and Responsibilities: (Reference: AFI 33-209)
16.1.2. Responsibilities: The STU-III or STE Responsible Officer will ensure all personnel
authorized access to the STU-III adhere to the procedures outlined below at all times.
16.1.3. Procedures: The STU-III or STE Responsible Officer will accomplish the following:
16.1.3.1. Only unclassified phone calls will be made on terminals that are in UNKEYED mode.
Removing the Crypto Ignition Key (CIK) makes the terminal UNKEYED and not secure.
16.1.3.2. When the terminal is in the KEYED mode, it must be afforded protection
 124                                         AFI31-401_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2008


commensurate with the level of the key it contains and may only be used by authorized
personnel. When unauthorized personnel who are not cleared to the level of the keyed terminal
are in the area, the terminal must be under the operational control and within the view of at least
one appropriately cleared and authorized person.
16.1.3.3. STU-III or STE terminals not operational 24-hours-a-day will have the CIK removed
at the close of business. The CIK will be stored in a safe. Secure infrequently used keys until
required.
16.1.3.4. Strict attention must be paid to the authentication display to ensure that the
classification level of the conversation does not exceed the highest clearance level between the
two parties. The information displayed indicates the system‘s capacity and does not authenticate
the person using the terminal.
16.1.3.5. Before discussing classified information on the STU-III or STE, the person making the
call will ascertain that each individual within hearing distance of their side of the conversation is
cleared to the classification level being discussed and that the need to know exists for those
personnel. If possible, isolate the phone from high traffic areas in an enclosed office.
16.1.4. Emergency Action Procedures: In the event of fire, natural disaster, or covert threat, the
CIK will be removed from the phone and kept on the person of an authorized individual or
secured in the normal classified storage container.

action should normally suffice to pass the material through unopened. However, if the senior
official demands to see the actual contents of the package, it may be opened in his or her

taken to show officials only as much of the contents as will satisfy them that the package does
not contain any other item. The courier should ask the official to repack the material or assist in
repacking it immediately upon completion of the examination. The courier should request that
the official provide evidence of the opening and inspection of the package by sealing and signing
it when closed and confirming on the courier certificate that the package has been opened. Both

the material.
