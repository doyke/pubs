                                           Chapter 1

                       VISION & IMPLEMENTATION CONCEPTS

1.1. Vision. The primary intent of this instruction is to facilitate timely development and
fielding of affordable and sustainable operational systems needed by the combatant commander.
The primary goal is to fulfill stated defense strategy needs with effects based, capabilities-
focused materiel and non-materiel solutions. These solutions must be well integrated to provide
suitable, safe, and interoperable increments of capability that are affordable throughout the life
cycle. The overarching strategic guidance detailed in the National Security Strategy (NSS), the
National Strategy for Homeland Security, the National Defense Strategy (NDS), the National
Military Strategy (NMS), the Defense Planning and Programming Guidance, the Guidance for
the Employment of the Force (GEF), and the most recent Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR)
lays the foundation for the Air Force’s needed capabilities. Capabilities are employed to achieve
desired effects in support of these strategies. The Air Force must be innovative and flexible in
the way it resources development of current and future defense strategies. The Air Force must
be able to integrate functions such as strategic planning, capabilities planning, early systems
engineering, operational capability requirements development, acquisition, lifecycle
management, and program and budget execution in order to effectively develop and field needed
operational systems in a timely manner.
1.2. Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS). The Air Force
operational capability requirements development process is closely linked and complies with its
Joint overarching guidance, JCIDS, as described in CJCSI 3170.01. The JCIDS process is
integrated with the acquisition process and exists to identify, develop, and validate Defense-
related operational requirements. JCIDS plays a key role in identifying the capabilities required
by the warfighters to support National Military Strategy and the National Strategy for Homeland
Defense. JCIDS integrates with the acquisition and the planning, programming, budgeting, and
execution (PPBE) processes to support improvements to existing warfighting capabilities and
development of new warfighting systems. The process validates warfighting capability needs
while considering the full range of materiel and non-materiel solutions. Operational capabilities
must be defined within the “art of the possible” and grounded within real world constraints of
time, technology, and affordability. Within DoD there is a distinct separation between the
requirements, programming, and acquisition authorities, which requires early and continued
collaboration between all communities in order for the processes to work effectively together.
1.3. Acquisition Category (ACAT) Levels. An acquisition category (potential level of
investment) is assigned to all Defense Acquisition initiatives that involve the development and/or
fielding of a materiel solution(s) necessary to mitigate an operational capability need. ACATs
are described in DoDI 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System. ACAT levels
(ACAT I, IA, II, and III) determine the level of program oversight, aid decentralized decision
making, and comply with Congressional and DoD direction. ACAT levels also provide the basis
for determining the level of oversight, validation, and approval of operational capability
requirements documents.

1.4. Drivers of Air Force Operational Capability Requirements. Figure 1.1 depicts various
contributing elements that identify gaps and shortfalls in operational capabilities, and influence
and define Air Force operational capability requirements.

Figure 1.1. Contributing Elements to Air Force Operational Capability Requirements.




   1.4.1. Capabilities Planning. Capabilities planning involves forecasting under uncertainty to
   provide capabilities suitable for a wide range of challenges and circumstances, all designed to
   achieve certain operational environment effects. The Air Force uses a Service-wide
   capabilities-based planning process (the AF/A5X led Air Force’s Capabilities Review & Risk
   Assessment [CRRA]) based on subjective, operational expertise and objective analysis to
   identify required capabilities and families of related capabilities, or capability objectives.
   CRRA results inform and support independent, mission-focused capabilities-based
   assessments (CBA) performed by Lead Commands. Refer to AFI 10-604, Capabilities-
   Based Planning, for details on Air Force capabilities planning.
       1.4.1.1. Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA). The CBA forms the analytic basis for
       operational capability requirements development and is an integral part of the capabilities
       planning process. The CBA defines the capability required and any capability
       gaps/shortfalls identified during the conduct of the assessment. The CBA consists of the
       following activities: analyzing what is required for the warfighter across all functional
       areas to accomplish the mission (defining the capability required), comparing the
       capability needs to the capabilities provided by any existing or planned systems (gap
       analysis), and identifying associated gaps/shortfalls and/or redundancies. The final step
       of the CBA is to offer recommendations on whether the gaps/shortfalls can be addressed
       by non-materiel means, materiel means, or both. Results of the CBA are documented in
       one of two documents; a Joint doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and
       education, personnel, or facilities (DOTMLPF) Change Recommendation (DCR) or an
       Initial Capabilities Document (ICD). The Air Force capability portfolio manager (CPM)
       works with the sponsor to develop, balance, and prioritize CBA results within their
       respective portfolios. Additional details on the CBA are provided in the JS/J8 JCIDS
       Manual, the JS/J8 CBA User’s Guide, and in the Air Force Materiel Command
       (AFMC)/Office of Aerospace Studies (OAS) CBA Handbook located at
       http://www.oas.kirtland.af.mil/.
   1.4.2. Top-Down Direction. Higher authority may direct a sponsor to initiate the
   development and fielding of an operational system to a warfighter need . Written direction
   from the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force (CSAF) or higher authority fulfills the
   AFPD 10-6 requirement for identifying a capability need. However, the designated sponsor
 8                                                      AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


     is still responsible for conducting appropriate supporting analysis and producing the
     necessary operational capability requirements documents to support development and/or
     fielding and sustainment of an operational system.
     1.4.3. Combatant Commander Needs. A combatant commander’s need may identify a
     capability gap/shortfall (perhaps identified in their integrated priority list (IPL)) that may be
     satisfied through two options: the normal acquisition process or the Rapid Response Process
     (RRP), as described in AFI 63-114, Rapid Response Process, and Attachment 3. Normal
     acquisition of combatant commander’s needs will require a Service Component sponsor who
     is responsible for conducting appropriate supporting analysis and producing the necessary
     operational capability requirements documents.
     1.4.4. Technology Transition Activities. Technology transition plays a crucial role in
     providing warfighters with superior operational systems, built on mature and affordable
     technologies. Current sources for capitalizing on technology transition are advanced
     technology demonstrations (ATD), Joint capability technology demonstrations (JCTD),
     experiments, operational exercises, wargames, DoD and Air Force laboratory and research
     projects, and commercial sources identified within the Defense Science and Technology
     (S&T) Program. Evaluation results can lead to a sponsor developing an appropriate
     operational capability requirements document to facilitate technology transition.
     1.4.5. Lessons Learned. A key method to achieve transformation of the Joint force is by
     producing compelling recommendations based on direct observations and sound analysis of
     current Joint operations, exercises and experiments. These recommendations (lessons) are
     derived from the full range of Joint activities and operations collected at the strategic,
     operational, and tactical level. Lessons assist senior leaders in making changes to
     DOTMLPF capabilities and guide associated programming, budgeting, and resourcing
     activities. To improve Joint capabilities and readiness, commanders may submit analytical
     observations directly to the Joint Lessons Learned Program (JLLP), as described in CJCSI
     3150.25, Joint Lessons Learned Program, and/or to the Air Force Lessons Learned Program
     (AFL2P), as described in AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned Program.
1.5. Implementation. Air Force requirements are driven by desired effects and needed
capabilities. All stakeholders in the acquisition framework must know why the Air Force needs
a particular capability, how and where it will be used, who will use it, when it is needed, and
how it will be supported and maintained. For a materiel solution, fielding an operational system
starts with sound strategies for concept refinement, requirements development, acquisition and
sustainment life cycle management, and test and evaluation (T&E). To be viable, these
strategies must be developed in concert and require early and ongoing collaboration among
operators, developers, programmers, systems engineers, acquirers, testers, sustainers, and
intelligence analysts. No one strategy can stand alone and still be viable, since all are
interdependent and require the integration of the others to be effective. Expanding upon the
collaborative effort, there are three mutually supporting Air Force processes that facilitate the
development and sustainment of operational systems: operational capability requirements
development as described in this instruction; operational capability acquisition and sustainment
as described in AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management; and integrated
operational testing as described in AFI 99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation. These
processes are interdependent and require collaboration to rapidly deliver new operational
systems to the warfighter. The three communities must use the guidance in all three instructions
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                                9


to integrate their efforts and create synergy. Figure 1.2 depicts the integration of the three
processes in relation to the overarching DoDI 5000.02 acquisition framework. Initiative
specifics (i.e., potential ACAT level, joint potential designator (JPD), etc.) will determine which
steps are executed within each process.

Figure 1.2. Integration of Requirements, Acquisition, and Test and Evaluation Processes.




   1.5.1. Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management. The primary goal of the
   acquisition system is to rapidly deliver affordable and sustainable operational systems that
   meet the warfighter’s needs. To achieve this goal, all stakeholders must collaborate in
   planning and execution activities that lead to developing, fielding, and sustaining new
   operational systems. After required capabilities and performance attributes are defined and
   approved, they are used to guide development, test and evaluation, production, procurement,
   deployment, sustainment, and disposal of the new operational system. Working with the
   operator, the acquirer builds an acquisition strategy that balances cost, schedule, and
   performance (operations and sustainment) in response to approved operational capability
   requirements documents. The acquisition strategy and the requirements strategy must align.
   Typical strategies take one of two forms (evolutionary acquisition (EA) or single step) and
   should be integrated with the requirements strategy through early collaborative development
   planning. Refer to AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle, for additional
   details.
       1.5.1.1. Evolutionary Acquisition (EA). EA is the DoD and AF preferred acquisition
       strategy for rapidly delivering needed capabilities to the warfighter based on the
       maturation of technologies. The success of the EA strategy depends on consistent and
 10                                                  AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


       repeated validation of operational capability requirements, stated in increments of
       increasing capability. The objective is to balance needs and potential capabilities with
       resources and to quickly put supportable operational systems into the hands of the
       operator. During all phases of EA, sustainment elements must be considered and included
       in acquisition planning in order to sustain the system cost effectively. Each capability
       increment may require a separate set of operational capability requirements documents.
       1.5.1.2. Single Step to Full Capability. When an acquisition program can achieve
       operator capability requirements within a single increment, such as with highly mature
       technology and/or off-the-shelf solutions, the acquirer may opt for a single-step strategy.
   1.5.2. Integrated Test and Evaluation (T&E). The overarching functions of T&E are to
   determine the operational capabilities and limitations of systems, to reduce risks, and to
   identify and help resolve deficiencies as early as possible. Integrated T&E combines
   developmental and operational test objectives to the maximum extent possible and provides
   assurance that systems will satisfy mission requirements in operational environments. Refer
   to AFI 99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation, for additional details.
1.6. Space-Related Operational Capability Requirements Development.
   1.6.1. Space-Related Operational Capability Requirements Development Policy. Space
   systems acquisitions are governed by DoDI 5000.02, and development of space-related
   operational capability requirements will follow guidance in CJCSI 3170.01. However, subtle
   differences in how space systems are developed and acquired necessitate some unique
   activities in operational capability requirements development. Space systems (e.g., satellites
   and boosters) are normally high-cost, small-quantity acquisitions purchased without the
   benefit of full-scale prototyping. Further, once launched, space assets do not lend themselves
   to major modification and upgrade. As such, developing the requisite operational
   requirements documentation requires additional rigor to ensure the system that is produced
   and launched provides the desired capability for the current increment.
   1.6.2. Operational Capability Requirements Documents and Acquisition Milestones.
   Operational capability requirements documents for space-related programs are the same as
   any other program, but may undergo additional iterations. As with all programs, a Capability
   Development Document (CDD) is required prior to a MS B decision. However, additional
   refinement of system requirements during preliminary design and the subsequent engineering
   and manufacturing development phase may result in a second iteration of the CDD for Air
   Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) validation and/or Joint Requirements
   Oversight Council (JROC) approval prior to MS C. This will precede development of the
   Capability Production Document (CPD), which will be the final requirements document prior
   to a build approval decision (analogous to the low-rate initial production (LRIP) decision for
   non-space production efforts).
1.7. Information Technology (IT) Requirements. The JROC recognizes IT initiatives are
dynamic in nature, often supported by quickly emerging technologies. In recognition of this,
CJCSI 3170.01 implements several approaches to developing IT requirements, each allowing for
flexibility and providing the planning necessary to incorporate evolving technologies throughout
the life cycle of the program. For additional information on IT operational capability
requirements development, see CJCSI 3170.01 and the AF/A5RP requirements web site.
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                             11


1.8. Operational Capability Requirements Development Training. There are two levels of
operational requirements training: Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Joint Staff and Air
Force.
   1.8.1. OSD/Joint Training. The OSD/Joint-level Requirements Management Certification
   Training (RMCT) provides key operational requirements personnel an end-to-end
   perspective of operational capability requirements development, highlighting the intersection
   between acquisition, resources, and operational requirements. Training is provided by the
   Defense Acquisition University (DAU) and is congressionally mandated for all DoD
   personnel involved in operational capability requirements development, staffing, validation,
   and approval. Additional information on policy, classes, and certification responsibilities is
   located on the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
   1.8.2. Air Force Training. Air Force operational capability requirements training is designed
   for Major Command (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agency (FOA), Direct Reporting Unit
   (DRU), and Headquarters Air Force (HAF) action officers responsible for developing and/or
   reviewing operational capability requirements documents. Training focuses on Air Force
   implementation of the operational capability requirements development process and is hands-
   on, experienced-based classroom and one-on-one instruction taught around the country. The
   Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) and AF/A5R conduct Air Force
   training. Additional information on classes, schedules, and registration is located on the
   AF/A5RP Requirements web site.

                                           Chapter 2

      OVERVIEW: AIR FORCE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Purpose. This chapter details the Air Force operational capability requirements
development process and provides guidance for Air Force requirements strategy, document
preparation, validation, approval, and archiving. With the exception of the Joint DCR,
operational capability requirements documents are developed to support acquisition activity for
operational materiel solutions as depicted in Figure 1.2. Within the Air Force, the Lead
Command responsible for a capability or mission (referred to as the sponsor) normally develops
requirements documents. In most cases, the sponsor, in coordination with the respective CPM,
determines when a specific requirements document is needed. However, the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, or the AFROC may also direct development of an
operational capability requirements document. This tasking will be directed to the appropriate
Air Force sponsor.
2.2. Operational Capability Requirements Documents. CJCSI 3170.01 directs the use of
four types of documents for operational capability requirements: the Joint DOTMLPF Change
Recommendation (DCR), the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the Capability Development
Document (CDD), and the Capability Production Document (CPD). Refer to CJCSI 3170.01 for
specific details on the use, content, and format of operational capability requirements documents.
   2.2.1. Joint DOTMLPF Change Recommendation (DCR). In cases where a Joint non-
   materiel solution(s) is recommended, or a Joint non-materiel solution can be implemented
   independent of proposed materiel needs, a joint doctrine, training, materiel, leadership and
   education, personnel, or facilities change recommendation (Joint DCR) is produced. A Joint
   DCR may be developed based on analysis provided in a CBA, an ICD, or other sources, such
   as results of an experiment, lessons learned, etc. All Air Force-led Joint DCRs are validated
   by the AFROC prior to Functional Capabilities Board (FCB) submittal. The JROC is final
   approval authority for all Joint DCRs. Refer to CJCSI 3170.01 for specific guidance on Joint
   DCRs.
   2.2.2. Initial Capabilities Document (ICD). In cases where an operational materiel solution
   is necessary, the operational capability requirements development process begins with the
   development of the ICD. An ICD articulates the requirement for a materiel solution (or in
   some cases, a materiel and non-materiel combination) to resolve a specific capability
   gap/shortfall or a set of capability gaps/shortfalls for a given timeframe identified as the
   result of a capabilities-based assessment (CBA). The follow-on to an ICD could be one or
   more CDDs. Refer to CJCSI 3170.01 for specific information on CBAs and ICDs.
   2.2.3. Capability Development Document (CDD). A CDD captures the information
   necessary to develop a proposed program, normally using an evolutionary acquisition
   strategy. The CDD outlines an affordable increment(s) of militarily useful, logistically
   supportable, and technically mature capability. Refer to CJCSI 3170.01 for specific
   information on CDDs.
   2.2.4. Capability Production Document (CPD). The CPD captures the information necessary
   to support production, testing, and deployment of an affordable and supportable increment
   within an acquisition strategy. Refer to CJCSI 3170.01 for specific information on CPDs.
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                                13


2.3. Additional Approaches to Documenting Operational Capability Requirements. The
Air Force has established two additional means to document operational capability requirements
in support of specific operational acquisition activities. They are the initial requirements
correlation table (RCT) contained in the analysis of alternatives (AoA) final report and the Air
Force Form 1067.
   2.3.1. Requirements Correlation Table (RCT). The RCT is a formatted summary of required
   operational characteristics, including threshold values for minimum performance
   characteristics, and if absolutely necessary, objective values, within the AoA final report, and
   CDD/CPD text. It assists operational and system requirements traceability and supports the
   development of follow-on requirements and acquisition documents. An initial RCT is
   created to summarize key capabilities that require further development during the
   Technology Development phase and is inserted into the AoA final report (see paragraph
   5.2.5).
   2.3.2. AF Form 1067 Modification Proposal. An AF Form 1067 documents the submission,
   review, and approval of requirements for modifications to fielded Air Force systems. Refer
   to Chapter 8 for instruction and criteria on the development, coordination, and approval of
   an Air Force Form 1067. Refer to AFI 63-131, Modification Program Management, for
   additional guidance on the Air Force modification process.
2.4. Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). An AoA is an analytical comparison of proposed materiel
solutions to gaps/shortfalls in operational capability, which helps in identifying the solution that
best balances cost, effectiveness, and risk. AoAs provide comparative cost, effectiveness, and
risk assessments of proposed alternatives against a baseline, typically the current operating
system. Information regarding formats, timelines, and support is available in the Road to
Materiel Development Decision (MDD) and AoA Handbooks on the AFMC/OAS web site
located at http://www.oas.kirtland.af.mil.
2.5. Document Development, Coordination, and Approval. The following paragraphs
describe the Air Force process for developing, coordinating, and approving operational
capability requirements documents. This process complements, but does not replace, the JCIDS
process established in CJCSI 3170.01.
   2.5.1. Requirements Strategy Development. Effective and timely delivery of required
   capability is predicated on the Air Force operational capability requirements development
   process and based on the formulation and execution of a viable requirements strategy. The
   requirements strategy establishes the path necessary to develop a quality operational
   requirements document that is capable of guiding future capability development activities.
   Each strategy is tailored to the acquisition phase, and addresses strategy elements such as:
   Joint interoperability/Joint implications, evolutionary acquisition, funding, schedule, testing,
   sustainment, training, analysis, intelligence support, potential challenges and constraints, etc.
   The sponsor develops the requirements strategy in collaboration with Air Force operator,
   systems engineer, acquisition, test, intelligence, and logistics communities, as well as other
   appropriate stakeholders (e.g., CPM, combatant commanders, FCB Working Group, Partner
   Nations, other Services and Agencies).
   2.5.2. Air Force Requirements Strategy Review (RSR). AF/A5R convenes an RSR to
   provide guidance and approval for a sponsor’s requirements strategy prior to convening a
   high performance team (HPT). The RSR is mandatory for all Air Force-sponsored ICDs,
14                                                  AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


  CDDs, CPDs, and Joint DCRs. During the RSR, AF/A5R reviews the requirements strategy;
  evaluates operator needs and required capabilities; examines all key performance parameters
  (KPPs) and, if necessary, select key system attributes (KSAs); ensures necessary
  involvement from Air Force organizations, agencies, OSD, Joint Staff and other Services;
  approves the HPT core team; and provides any necessary guidance to support the most
  effective acquisition approach. The RSR should occur at least 30 days before the HPT
  convenes, to allow for AF/A5R-directed requirements strategy changes. The RSR briefing is
  coordinated with an assigned AF/A5RP HPT facilitator and HAF subject matter expert
  (SME). After AF/A5R approval, AF/A5RP archives a copy of the RSR briefing and RSR
  minutes in the Information & Resource Support System (IRSS). RSR scheduling,
  membership, procedures, and briefing templates are located on the AF/A5RP Requirements
  web site.
  2.5.3. Air Force Requirements Development High Performance Team (HPT). The sponsor-
  led, AF/A5R-facilitated HPT captures, articulates, and documents the operator’s
  requirements in minimum time, while achieving stakeholder buy-in. Ideally, the HPT will
  consist of 7-11 core participants, which includes a lead (the sponsor, during a requirements
  development HPT), a facilitator, Air Force SMEs (i.e., operators, systems engineers,
  acquirers, testers, logisticians, intelligence support managers, etc.), government agencies and
  other Services (as required), and support team members (not physically present but available
  via phone or e-mail for reach back). The HPT accelerates the documentation process;
  improves the quality of the requirements document; and can provide an enduring forum for
  developing, fielding, and sustaining operational systems. The HPT lead maintains
  responsibility for the document throughout the review and approval process. An AF/A5RP-
  facilitated HPT must be used to develop an operational capability requirements document
  unless waived by AF/A5R at the RSR. HPT membership and staffing process information is
  located on the AF/A5RP web site.
     2.5.3.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC personnel participating as core or support members in
     an operational requirements HPT should have relevant experience in the HPT subject
     matter, have a history of involvement with the effort, and actively assist the MAJCOM
     customer at the earliest opportunity. Early and continuous involvement in HPTs by
     qualified AFMC personnel helps ensure requirements issues are resolved at the earliest
     opportunity.
     2.5.3.2. (Added-AFMC) AFMC organizations involved with HPTs will maintain
     organizational and personnel continuity (when possible) with the capability/requirements
     throughout the life-cycle. Ideally, membership on an HPT should evolve from preceding
     activities; e.g., CDD HPT membership evolves from organizations involved with the ICD
     HPT. AFMC HPT members should participate in acquisition strategy development to
     ensure consistency between operational requirements and acquisition.
     2.5.3.3. (Added-AFMC) AFMC participation in operational requirements HPTs
     consists of core and support membership.
         2.5.3.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Core members actively participate in document creation
         and attend the HPT event. AFMC core members attending the HPT event and
         representing AFMC with regard to the requirements process must complete Defense
         Acquisition University (DAU) training modules CLM 041, Capabilities-Based
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                         15


         Planning, and RQM 110, Core Concepts for Requirements Management, prior to
         attending the HPT. Core participants at ACAT I CDD HPTs must also be at least an
         E-7/O-4/GS-13 grade (commensurate with their organizational structure), and hold an
         Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP) Level II certification (or
         equivalent) in their functional specialty.      These qualifications are strongly
         recommended for participants in all other HPTs.
            2.5.3.3.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Requests for waivers to grade requirements and/or
            APDP certification for ACAT I CDD HPT events shall be initiated through HQ
            AFMC/A5C. No waivers will be granted to the requirement of completing DAU
            modules CLM 041 and RQM 110 prior to attending an HPT event.
         2.5.3.3.2. (Added-AFMC) Support members actively participate in document
         creation but do not attend the HPT event. However, they are essential to document
         development since most of the document is written prior to the HPT event. Support
         members should complete DAU modules CLM 041 and RQM 110 prior to assisting
         but are not required to do so. Other HPT support members and topical experts may
         be consulted as needed during the HPT event.
  2.5.4. Document Review. Following the HPT, the sponsor submits the document via IRSS
  for simultaneous O-6 level Air Force and Joint staffing, in accordance with Attachment 2 of
  this instruction. Additional information can be found on the AF/A5RP Requirements web
  site.
     2.5.4.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/A2/5 leads AFMC participation in Air Force
     document reviews by distributing Air Force operational requirements documents (ICDs,
     CDDs, CPDs, DCRs) across AFMC for O-6 review, collecting all AFMC document
     comments, and then developing a command position concerning the document prior to
     forwarding comments to AF/A5RP.        Note: AFMC organizations will likewise be
     notified when Joint operational requirements documents are available for review and
     comment.
     2.5.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Prior to a requirements document meeting an AFROC, HQ
     AFMC/A2/5 will distribute the sponsoring MAJCOM’s adjudication of comments to
     AFMC personnel who submitted comments. Reviewers will verify comments were
     satisfactorily incorporated or resolved. HQ AFMC/A2/5 will mediate between AFMC
     personnel and the user community when there is a dispute concerning comment
     adjudication on requirements documents.
  2.5.5. Lead Command Submittal of Air Force Requirements Documents. Following
  document review, the sponsor submits the document for AFROC validation, accompanied by
  a transmittal letter signed by the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA Commander (CC) for potential
  ACAT I documents, Vice Commander (CV) for potential ACAT II documents, or Director of
  Requirements for potential ACAT III documents, signifying their approval, as illustrated in
  Table 2.1. Additional information can be found on the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
  2.5.6. Document Validation. The validation phase is the formal review process of an
  operational capability requirements document to confirm capability needs and operational
  requirements. The validation authority for an Air Force operational capability requirements
  document is based on its JPD (JROC Interest, Joint Capabilities Board (JCB) Interest, Joint
 16                                                  AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


   Integration, Joint Information or Independent), as illustrated in Table 2.1. The JS/J8
   Gatekeeper assigns the JPD for all ICDs, CDDs, CPDs, and Joint DCRs when the documents
   are entered into formal Joint Staff coordination. For specific information on JPD
   designations, see CJCSI 3170.01.

     REQUIREMENTS ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT MATERIEL DEVELOPMENT
                             DECISION

4.1. Purpose. This chapter provides a high-level description of operational capability
requirements development activities necessary to support a Materiel Development Decision
(MDD) (Figure 4.1). Operational capability requirements development begins with the ICD
(either a newly developed ICD or an A5R-approved deficiency linkage to an existing ICD or
urgent operational need (UON)).         The ICD summarizes gaps/shortfalls identified during
capabilities planning activities and provides rationale for a materiel solution. The ICD lays the
foundation for subsequent concept development activities, the MDD, the Materiel Solution
Analysis phase, the AoA, the initial milestone review (as identified at the MDD), and all
subsequent phase activities. All potential acquisition programs must proceed through a MDD
review, where the MDA will identify the initial milestone review (A, B, or C) and phase of entry
into the acquisition process.

Figure 4.1. Activities to Support MDD.




4.2. ICD. The ICD documents the need for a materiel approach (or a combined materiel/non-
materiel approach) to satisfy specific capability gaps/shortfalls. The ICD articulates the
necessity to resolve a specific capability gap/shortfall (or gaps/shortfalls) for a given timeframe
identified through a CBA performed during capabilities planning. The follow-on of an ICD
could be one or more CDDs, CPDs, Joint DCRs, or a combination of these documents.
Additional guidance on strategy development, RSRs, and HPTs is located on the AF/A5RP
Requirements web site.
 32                                                   AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


   4.2.1. ICD Requirements Strategy Development. The sponsor develops the requirements
   strategy in collaboration with the appropriate Air Force CPM, operators, systems engineers,
   acquirers, testers, sustainers, and intelligence analysts. The strategy maps the details
   necessary for developing an ICD and describes the resources and communities necessary to
   support the process. Strategy development includes sponsor’s interaction with the Joint
   Staff, other Services, and agencies. Continuous collaboration ensures the requirements
   strategy addresses required capabilities identified in applicable Joint and Air Force enabling
   & operating concepts, capabilities planning documents, and other pertinent guidance. In
   addition, consideration must be given to the focus and depth of analysis that will be needed
   to support the development of the ICD.
   4.2.2. ICD Requirements Strategy Review (RSR). An RSR is mandatory for all Air Force-
   sponsored ICDs. AF/A5R chairs and approves the requirements strategy for ICD
   development at the RSR. Sponsors must ensure that all items on the RSR checklist (on the
   AF/A5RP Requirements web site) are complete and ready for presentation. An RSR is
   required prior to convening an HPT for an ICD and should occur at least 30 days before
   starting an HPT.
   4.2.3. ICD HPT. Following strategy approval, an HPT is conducted to finalize the ICD and
   prepare it for formal staffing and validation at the AFROC. Ideally, core membership for an
   ICD HPT evolves from the CBA participant organizations, and must include representatives
   from the Lead Command, Operating Command, science and technology community, systems
   engineering community, HAF SMEs, representatives from other agencies/Services,
   combatant commands, and others as needed. Additional guidance for the preparation and
   execution of the ICD HPT is located on the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
       4.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC core participants for ICD HPTs are typically a Science
       and Technology representative from AFRL, a Center systems engineer, and a
       representative from the developmental test community. In addition to the core
       participants, AFMC will provide support team participants. The support team may
       consist of, but not be limited to, acquisition intelligence, finance, human systems, or other
       functional representatives not participating as core team members.
   4.2.4. ICD Review and Approval. Following the HPT, the ICD is submitted for formal
   staffing in accordance with Attachment 2. Specific coordination guidance and timelines are
   located on the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
   4.2.5. ICD Validation. Upon completion of staffing, the document sponsor will present the
   ICD at the AFROC for Air Force validation. The level of review, validation, and approval
   beyond the AFROC is dependent upon the document’s JPD (Table 2.1). Specific guidance is
   located on the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
4.3. Post-ICD Activities. An approved ICD provides the sponsor and systems engineer
personnel the appropriate scoping mechanism to conduct concept development and refinement
activities. The collaborative effort initiated during ICD development supports early Systems
Engineering (SE) activities and continues through the MDD and the AoA.
   4.3.1. Early Systems Engineering (SE) Support. Early SE efforts (pre-MS A) scope the
   trade space associated with the gaps/shortfalls identified in the ICD, and establish appropriate
   boundaries to begin developing prospective materiel solutions. Analytical data (e.g.,
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                            33


  parametric study results, performance curves, etc.) generated during these activities populate
  the knowledge base for concepts being explored to mitigate the gaps/shortfalls. When
  applied in a rigorous and disciplined manner, robustly evolved concepts and their supporting
  data will permit higher-confidence estimates of cost, schedule, and technical performance,
  along with more comprehensive and integrated risk assessments, and will lead to better-
  informed decisions. Early SE activities are further described in AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle
  Systems Engineering, and AFI 63-101.            Additional information regarding concept
  development activities and the Road to MDD Handbook is available on the AFMC/OAS web

      REQUIREMENTS ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT MILESTONE A ACQUISITION
                               DECISION

5.1. Purpose. This chapter provides a high-level description of operational capability
requirements development activities necessary to support a MS A decision (Figure 5.1). The
collaborative effort initiated during requirements strategy development continues throughout the
Materiel Solution Analysis phase and directly supports the AoA and MS A.

Figure 5.1. Activities to Support Milestone A Acquisition Decision.




5.2. Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). An AoA occurs during the Materiel Solution Analysis
phase and applies to all ACAT initiatives in accordance with DoDI 5000.02 and AFI 63-101
direction. The AoA is an analytical comparison of the operational effectiveness, suitability, risk,
and life-cycle cost of alternatives that satisfy validated capability needs (usually stipulated in an
approved ICD). The AoA must identify cost-effective alternative(s) and make a compelling
statement about the capabilities and military worth that alternative(s) will provide. The AoA
helps decision-makers select courses of action (COA) to satisfy an operational capability need,
while providing the analytic basis for performance attributes documented in the RCT, CDD,
and/or CPD. In short, the AoA must provide clear and unambiguous data, enabling senior Air
Force leaders the ability to debate and assess a potential program's operational capability and
affordability, and maximize investment. Consequently, AoA data has a great impact on the DoD
PPBE process. All AoAs must be conducted IAW the MDD acquisition decision memorandum
(ADM) and any additional guidance provided by appropriate requirements and acquisition
authorities. Information regarding formats, timelines, and support is available in the Road to
MDD and AoA Handbooks on the AFMC/OAS web site at http://www.oas.kirtland.af.mil/.
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                         35


  5.2.1. ACAT I and non-delegated ACAT II AoAs
     5.2.1.1. Execution and Review. The sponsor is responsible for executing the AoA for a
     potential ACAT I or non-delegated ACAT II program with assistance from AFMC/OAS.
     The AoA study team evolves from the ICD HPT membership and includes AFMC/OAS,
     and others (as necessary). The OSD Office of the Director, Cost Assessment and
     Program Evaluation (D/CAPE) and Air Force Cost Analysis Agency (AFCAA) provide
     direction during early AoA planning activities and may participate on the AoA team.
     The AFROC reviews and validates the AoA study plan, AoA interim progress (if
     necessary), and AoA final report. Additional guidance is available in the AoA Handbook
     located on the AFMC/OAS web site.
     5.2.1.2. Study Plan. The AoA study team develops a study plan of sufficient detail to
     address the issues established in the ADM and to ensure a rigorous analysis process.
     Sponsors will coordinate the study plan and proposed briefings with AFMC/OAS prior to
     presentation to the AFROC for validation. The HAF SME will staff a memorandum
     through AF/A5R to release the AFROC-validated AoA study plan to D/CAPE for
     approval prior to beginning the AoA study. Additional guidance is available in the AoA
     Handbook located on the AFMC/OAS web site.
     5.2.1.3. Interim Progress. An interim progress briefing may be requested by AF/A5R,
     AFROC, or study sponsor. The most common reasons for interim progress briefings
     include: completion of initial alternative screening/down-selecting, changes to key
     assumptions and constraints; significant modification of the Mission Tasks and Measures
     of Effectiveness/Performance; or knowledge gained in the analysis to date that would
     impact requirements decisions.
     5.2.1.4. Final Report. The AoA final report captures and presents the methodology and
     results of the analysis. The AoA findings outlined in the final report are further
     developed into COAs and support the development of an initial RCT for programs
     entering the Technology Development phase. The initial RCT will reside within the body
     of the AoA final report. After the final report has been prepared and coordinated with
     AoA stakeholders, sponsors will coordinate the final AoA report and AFROC briefing
     with AFMC/OAS prior to AFROC presentation for validation. After AFROC validation,
     the sponsor forwards the final report to the HAF SME who will staff the report through
     AF/A5R to the VCSAF for release to D/CAPE. AoA final reports must be provided to
     D/CAPE for sufficiency assessment at least 60 days before the acquisition board for the
     initial milestone review. Additional guidance is available in the AoA Handbook located
     on the AFMC/OAS web site.
     5.2.1.5. AoA Sufficiency. In rare circumstances a sponsor may request use of existing
     analysis in lieu of a formal AoA to support capability enhancements to a fielded system,
     or in unique cases, initiation of a new program. The AFROC must validate the
     sufficiency of the analysis based upon the same criteria as if a formal AoA was
     conducted prior to moving forward with post-Milestone A activities (e.g., development of
     an RCT and/or release of a final request for proposal (RFP) to support any Technology
     Development phase activities; development of a CDD to support preliminary design
     activities; or development of a CPD to support Production and Deployment phase
     activities). The sponsor must coordinate the AoA sufficiency package and proposed
36                                                AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


     AFROC briefing with AFMC/OAS and appropriate HAF SME prior to submittal to
     AF/A5RP for AF/A5R review and AFROC validation. Upon validation, AF/A5R will
     determine if sufficiency requires VCSAF review prior to release to D/CAPE for review.
     Additional guidance is available in the AoA Handbook located on the AFMC/OAS web
     site.
  5.2.2. Delegated ACAT II or ACAT III AoAs. The analytic rigor and scope of a delegated
  ACAT II or ACAT III AoA may be less than that of an ACAT I, but is ultimately determined
  by the guidance provided at the MDD.
     5.2.2.1. Execution and Review. The sponsor is responsible for executing the AoA for a
     potential delegated ACAT II or ACAT III program with assistance from AFMC/OAS.
     The AoA study team builds upon the ICD HPT membership and includes others, as
     necessary. The AFROC reviews and provides validation of the AoA study plan, AoA
     interim progress (if necessary), and AoA final report. Additional guidance is available in
     the AoA Handbook located on the AFMC/OAS web site.
     5.2.2.2. Study Plan. The AoA study team develops a study plan of sufficient detail to
     address the issues established in the ADM and to ensure a rigorous analysis process.
     Sponsors must coordinate the study plan and proposed briefings with AFMC/OAS prior
     to presentation to the AFROC for validation and release to the AoA study team lead.
     Additional guidance is available in the AoA Handbook located on the AFMC/OAS web
     site.
     5.2.2.3. Final Report. The AoA final report captures and presents the methodology and
     results of the analysis. The AoA findings outlined in the final report are further
     developed into COAs and support the development of an initial RCT for programs
     entering the Technology Development phase. The initial RCT will reside within the body
     of the AoA final report. After final results have been prepared and coordinated with AoA
     stakeholders, sponsors will coordinate the proposed briefings and final report with
     AFMC/OAS prior to presentation to the AFROC for validation. AF/A5R will determine
     if final report requires VCSAF review prior to its submittal to the MDA and to AF/A5RP
     for archival in IRSS. Additional guidance is available in the AoA Handbook located on
     the AFMC/OAS web site.
     5.2.2.4. AoA Sufficiency. In rare circumstances a sponsor may request use of existing
     analysis in lieu of a formal AoA to support capability enhancements to a fielded system,
     or in unique cases, initiation of a new program. AF/A5R must approve the analysis
     before it is presented at the MDD or is used to support any of the following: development
     of an RCT and/or release of a final request for proposal (RFP) to support any Technology
     Development phase activities; development of a CDD to support preliminary design
     activities; or development of a CPD to support Production and Deployment phase
     activities. AF/A5R approval is based on the same criteria as if a formal AoA was
     conducted. The sponsor must coordinate the AoA sufficiency package with the
     appropriate HAF SME prior to submittal to AF/A5RP for AF/A5R approval. In certain
     circumstances, AF/A5R may request AFMC/OAS review, AFROC validation, or both
     prior to approval. Additional guidance is available in the AoA Handbook located on the
     AFMC/OAS web site.
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                             37


   5.2.3. AoA to Support Milestone B or C. Before MS B or C, the MDA may require a new
   AoA, or an update to a previous AoA, to account for any factors that were omitted or may
   have changed during the preceding acquisition phase. Staffing of these AoAs to VCSAF and
   subsequently to OSD will be accomplished in the same manner as the original AoA study
   plan and AoA final report.
   5.2.4. Initial Requirements Correlation Table (RCT). An initial RCT is created to
   summarize key capabilities that require further development during the Technology
   Development phase and is inserted into the AoA final report. The primary objectives of the
   RCT are to provide a concise summary of key capabilities to assist requirements traceability,
   to inform contracting activities to begin technology development efforts, and to help decision
   makers make informed conclusions and/or decisions. The initial RCT contains a minimal
   number of operational performance characteristics (KPPs and KSAs), directly linked to the
   gaps/shortfalls documented in the ICD(s) and is framed by Measures of Effectiveness
   (MOE), Measures of Performance (MOP), and concept of operations in the AoA. During the
   Technology Development phase, these performance characteristics become more clearly
   understood and refined. This initial RCT is not as comprehensive as the RCT resident in the
   CDD or CPD, but evolves as technology matures and is updated, if necessary, prior to
   competitive prototyping. The initial RCT, embedded with the final AoA results, must be
   validated by the AFROC prior to System Requirements Document (SRD) approval and/or
   release of a final request for proposal (RFP) to support any Technology Development phase
   activity. The RCT ultimately supports the development of follow-on SRDs, CDDs, CPDs,
   and acquisition program baselines (APB), and assists operational and system requirements
   traceability. Specific guidance on the initial RCT is located on the AF/A5RP Requirements
   web site.
       5.2.4.1. RCT Format. The RCT captures the KPPs, KSAs, their threshold and objective
       values, and provides the rationale/analytical reference for the values (Table 5.1).

          5.2.4.1.2. Joint Capability Area (JCA) Tier 1/2. Cite the primary Tier 1 JCA and
          primary Tier 2 JCA, if applicable.
          5.2.4.1.3. KPP/KSA. Insert the operational performance characteristic for which the
          threshold and objective values are identified. This minimal set of KPPs/KSAs

     (ideally no more than two for each) will focus Technology Development phase
     efforts.
     5.2.4.1.4. Technology Development Threshold. Insert the minimum acceptable
     technology development threshold value for the corresponding operational
     performance characteristic below which utility of subject characteristic becomes
     questionable. The technology development threshold must be supported by analytical
     rigor that demonstrates its operational utility and the need for resource investment.
     5.2.4.1.5. Technology Development Objective. Only when absolutely necessary,
     insert the desired technology development objective value for the corresponding
     operational performance characteristic above threshold value. The development
     objective value must be supported by analytical rigor that demonstrates its operational
     utility and the need for significant operational improvement over threshold value and
     the demand for additional resource investment.
     5.2.4.1.6. Rationale/Analytical      References.          Briefly    summarize      the
     rationale/analytical references of the subject KPPs/KSAs. Define the operational
     utility for both threshold and objective values. Reference the capability gap(s) in the
     ICD and identify the specific studies, analysis, threat assessments, modeling, or other
     reference sources (including informed military judgments) that justify and
     substantiate both values.

    REQUIREMENTS ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT MILESTONE B ACQUISITION
                             DECISION

6.1. Purpose. This chapter provides a high-level description of operational capability
requirements development activities necessary to support a MS B decision (Figure 6.1). The
RCT validated prior to MS A may require updating to support competitive prototyping activities,
and to capture knowledge obtained during early technology development. The CDD is
developed and approved in sufficient time to serve as basis for the definition of the system
design requirements for the preliminary design review (PDR) and MS B. If needed, the CDD is
updated prior to MS B.

Figure 6.1. Activities to Support Milestone B Acquisition Decision.




6.2. RCT Update. The sponsor and MDA may decide an update to the RCT is necessary to
adequately support prototyping activities. The update will capture lessons learned from
technology maturation and will identify additional and/or revised key requirements. The updated
RCT must be validated by the AFROC prior to SRD approval and/or release of a final RFP to
support competitive prototyping during Technology Development phase. Specific guidance on
the RCT update is located on the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
6.3. Capability Development Document (CDD). The CDD is a document that captures the
information necessary to develop a proposed program, normally using an evolutionary
acquisition strategy. A CDD outlines an affordable increment(s) of militarily useful, logistically
supportable, and technically mature capability. The CDD contains a carefully selected minimum
set of prioritized requirements (e.g., KPPs, KSAs, and additional attributes), understanding each
requirement has potential to drive additional cost, schedule, and associated risks. A validated
and approved CDD is required prior to PDR and the MS B, whichever occurs first. It provides
 40                                                   AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


the operational KPPs, KSAs, and other attributes necessary to design and sustain the proposed
system. It captures the evaluation of different materiel solutions and recommends the best
approach to achieve the needed capability. It discusses the overall acquisition strategy, describes
the current increment and provides an outline of the overall acquisition program strategy.
   6.3.1. CDD Requirements Strategy Development. The sponsor develops the requirements
   strategy in collaboration with the appropriate Air Force CPM, operators, developers, systems
   engineers, acquirers, testers, sustainers, and intelligence analysts. The requirements strategy
   lays the foundation for CDD development and supports the Engineering and Manufacturing
   Development (EMD) phase for a single increment. During strategy development, the
   sponsor must interact with the Joint Staff, other Services, and agencies. For potential ACAT
   I programs, the sponsor continues collaborating with D/CAPE. The preferred materiel
   solution is based on analysis and mature technologies demonstrated prior to MS B. The
   sponsor applies lessons learned during the previous phases, plus any other appropriate risk
   reduction activities such as experimentation, T&E, and capability/schedule tradeoffs.
   Additional guidance on strategy development is located on the AF/A5RP Requirements web
   site.
   6.3.2. CDD Requirements Strategy Review (RSR). An RSR is mandatory for all Air Force-
   sponsored CDDs. AF/A5R chairs and approves the requirements strategy for CDD
   development at the RSR. Sponsors must ensure that all items on the RSR checklist (on the
   AF/A5RP Requirements web site) are complete and ready for presentation. An RSR is
   required prior to convening an HPT for a CDD and should occur at least 30 days before
   starting an HPT.
   6.3.3. CDD HPT. Following strategy approval, an HPT is conducted to finalize the CDD
   and prepare it for formal staffing and validation at the AFROC. Ideally, core membership for
   a CDD HPT evolves from the ICD HPT and AoA/RCT participant organizations, and must
   include representatives from the Lead Command, Operating Command, acquisition, logistics,
   and test communities, HAF SMEs, representatives from other agencies, Services, and others
   as needed. Additional guidance for the preparation and execution of the CDD HPT is located
   on the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
       6.3.3.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC core participants for CDD HPTs are typically the PM,
       a program office systems engineer and logistician, and a developmental test
       representative. In addition to the core participants, AFMC will provide support team
       participants. The support team may consist of, but not be limited to, acquisition
       intelligence, finance, human systems, or other functional representatives not participating
       as core team members.
   6.3.4. CDD Review and Approval. Following the HPT, the CDD is submitted for formal
   staffing in accordance with Attachment 2. Specific coordination guidance and timelines are
   located on the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
   6.3.5. CDD Validation. Upon completion of staffing, the document sponsor will present the
   CDD at the AFROC for Air Force validation. The level of review, validation, and approval
   beyond the AFROC is dependent upon the document’s JPD (Table 2.1). Specific guidance is
   located on the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
6.4. CDD Guidelines.
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                              41


   6.4.1. Performance Attributes. The CDD provides performance and support-related
   attributes with threshold and, if necessary, objective values. The sponsor, in collaboration
   with the acquisition community, prioritizes requirements into three levels: KPPs, KSAs, and
   additional attributes. Performance attribute values apply only to the current increment or, in
   a single-step-to-full-capability approach, to the entire system. Follow guidelines and format
   as described in CJCSI 3170.01 and this AFI for CDD development.
6.5. CDD Requirements Correlation Table (RCT). The CDD RCT is a summary of all
required capability characteristics listed as threshold and, if necessary, objective values within
the CDD text. The RCT provides a concise summary to assist requirements traceability and
support informed decision-making. Air Force CDD RCTs expand on the tables required by
CJCSI 3170.01 by including “Paragraph Number” and “Rationale and Analytical References”
columns.
   6.5.1. CDD RCT Format. The RCT consists of three separate tables: “Key Performance
   Parameter” (Table 6.1), “Key System Attribute” (Table 6.2), and “Additional Attribute”
   (Table 6.3). All three tables have a similar format with the exception of the subject column
   (e.g., “KPP,” “KSA,” and “Additional Attribute”). The following information is required in
   each column for all three tables.
       6.5.1.1. Paragraph Number. Cite the CDD paragraph where text for KPP/attribute is
       located.
       6.5.1.2. Joint Capability Area (JCA) Tier 1/2. Cite the primary Tier 1 and 2 JCA
       (applicable to KPP and KSA tables only).
       6.5.1.3. KPP/KSA/Additional Attributes.           Insert the operational      performance
       characteristic for which the threshold and objective values are identified.
       6.5.1.4. Development Threshold. Insert the minimum acceptable threshold value for the
       corresponding operational performance characteristic below which utility of subject
       characteristic becomes questionable. The development threshold must be supported by
       analytical rigor that demonstrates its operational utility and the need for resource
       investment. The development threshold must be obtainable, measurable, and testable.
       If the development threshold value is planned to be achieved following completion of
       IOT&E, include a testable value to be achieved/demonstrated for evaluation during the
       IOT&E.
       6.5.1.5. Development Objective. Only when absolutely necessary, insert the desired
       operational objective value for the corresponding operational performance characteristic
       above threshold value. The development objective value must be supported by analytical
       rigor that demonstrates its operational utility, the need for significant operational
       improvement over threshold value, and the demand for additional resource investment.
       The development objective must be obtainable, measurable, and testable.
       6.5.1.6. Rationale/Analytical References. Briefly summarize (in 3 - 4 bullets) the
       rationale/analytical references of subject KPP/KSA/additional attributes as described
       within the text of the CDD. Identify the rationale for the operational utility and include
       the specific studies, analysis, threat assessments, modeling, or other reference sources
       (including informed military judgments) that justify and substantiate the threshold value,
       and if absolutely necessary, objective value.

6.6. Changes to the CDD.
   6.6.1. CDD Update. A need may arise to update an approved CDD in order to accurately
   document changes that have occurred before and/or during EMD. Prior to any CDD update,
   the sponsor must contact AF/A5RP and schedule an RSR to determine the Air Force level of
   review and approval authority. Proposed changes to KPPs, KSAs, and/or additional
   attributes must be accompanied by a funding strategy and schedule that have been
   coordinated with the appropriate program office. As a minimum, all changes to KPPs
   (regardless of ACAT) must be validated at the AFROC and agreed upon by CSAF (ACAT I)
   or VCSAF (ACAT II/III). Additional information on CDD updates is located on the
   AF/A5RP Requirements web site and CJCSI 3170.01.
        6.6.1.1. JROC Interest CDDs. The JROC will approve any change to CDDs having a
        JPD of JROC Interest unless the JROC has specifically delegated approval authority to
        the Air Force. The AFROC must validate any change to a KPP prior to JROC submittal.
        For all other changes, AF/A5R will determine the level of Air Force review and/or
        validation prior to JROC submittal.
        6.6.1.2. JCB Interest CDDs. The JCB will approve any change to CDDs having a JPD of
        JCB Interest unless the JCB has specifically delegated approval authority to the Air
        Force. The AFROC must validate any change to a KPP prior to JCB submittal. For all
        other changes, AF/A5R will determine the level of Air Force review and/or validation
        prior to JCB submittal.
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                        43


     6.6.1.3. Independent, Joint Information, and Joint Integration CDDs. The Air Force will
     approve any change to CDDs having a JPD of Independent, Joint Information, or Joint
     Integration (Table 2.1). The AFROC must validate any change to a KPP prior to Air
     Force approval. For all non-KPP changes, AF/A5R will determine the level of Air Force
     review and/or validation prior to Air Force approval.
  6.6.2. CDD Annex. A CDD annex is a separate document describing unique requirements
  for a variant of the core capability captured in the parent CDD. The annex is developed to
  add capability for a specific mission not covered within the CDD (for example, a special
  operations variant of a mobility aircraft). In addition to applicable mandatory KPPs, the
  CDD annex should identify a minimum of one performance KPP to describe the unique
  capability. All sections of the annex unchanged from the original CDD display the words
  “No Change” in that section. The original CDD accompanies the annex (as reference only)
  during document review. AF/A5R determines the level of review and approval authority
  required. Additional information on CDD updates is located on the AF/A5RP Requirements
  web site.

                                           Chapter 7

      REQUIREMENTS ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT MILESTONE C ACQUISITION
                               DECISION

7.1. Purpose. This chapter provides a high-level description of operational capability
requirements process activities conducted to support a MS C acquisition decision (Figure 7.1).
The CPD directly supports the Production & Deployment and Operations & Support phases.
Results of the AoA, critical design review (CDR), APB, system demonstrations, and early test
activity provide the basis for CPD development. An approved CPD is required for MS C.

Figure 7.1. Activities to Support Milestone C Acquisition Decision.




7.2. Capability Production Document (CPD). The CPD outlines an affordable increment of
militarily useful, logistically supportable, and technically mature capability. The CPD contains a
carefully selected minimum set of prioritized requirements (e.g., KPPs, KSAs, and additional
attributes), understanding each requirement has potential to drive additional cost, schedule, and
associated risks. A validated and approved CPD is required before each MS C. It provides the
operational KPPs, KSAs, and other attributes necessary to produce and sustain the system.
   7.2.1. CPD Requirements Strategy Development. The sponsor develops the requirements
   strategy in collaboration with the appropriate Air Force CPM, operators, acquirers, testers,
   sustainers, and intelligence analysts. The requirements strategy lays the foundation for CPD
   development and supports the Production and Deployment phase for a single increment.
   Strategy development includes sponsor’s interaction with the Joint Staff, other Services, and
   agencies. The selected materiel solution is based on analysis and mature technologies
   demonstrated prior to MS C. The sponsor applies lessons learned during the previous phases
   plus any other appropriate risk reduction activities such as experimentation, T&E, and
   capability/schedule tradeoffs. Additional guidance on strategy development is located on the
   AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                              45


   7.2.2. CPD Requirements Strategy Review (RSR). An RSR is mandatory for all Air Force-
   sponsored CPDs. AF/A5R chairs and approves the requirements strategy for CPD
   development at the RSR. Sponsors should ensure that all items on the RSR checklist (on the
   AF/A5RP Requirements web site) are complete and ready for presentation. An RSR is
   required prior to convening an HPT for a CPD and should occur at least 30 days before
   starting an HPT.
   7.2.3. CPD HPT. Following strategy approval, an HPT is conducted to finalize the CPD and
   prepare it for formal staffing and validation at the AFROC. Ideally, core membership for a
   CPD HPT evolves from the CDD HPT participant organizations and must include
   representatives from the Lead Command, Operating Command, acquisition, logistics, and
   test communities, HAF SMEs, representatives from other agencies, Services, and others as
   needed. Additional guidance for the preparation and execution of the CPD HPT is located on
   the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
       7.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC core participants for CPD HPTs are typically the PM,
       a program office logistician, and a developmental test representative (if required). In
       addition to the core participants, AFMC will provide support team participants. The
       support team may consist of, but not be limited to, acquisition intelligence, finance,
       human systems, or other functional representatives not participating as core team
       members.
   7.2.4. CPD Review and Approval. Following the HPT, the CPD is submitted for formal
   staffing in accordance with Attachment 2. Specific coordination guidance and timelines are
   located on the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
   7.2.5. CPD Validation. Upon completion of staffing, the document sponsor will present the
   CPD at the AFROC for Air Force validation. The level of review, validation, and approval
   beyond the AFROC depends on the document’s JPD (Table 2.1). Specific guidance is
   located on the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
7.3. CPD Guidelines.
   7.3.1. Performance Attributes. The CPD provides performance and support-related
   attributes with threshold and, if necessary, objective values. The sponsor, in collaboration
   with the acquisition community, prioritizes requirements into three levels: KPPs, KSAs, and
   additional attributes. Performance attribute values apply only to the current increment or, in
   a single-step-to-full-capability approach, to the entire system. Follow guidelines and format
   as described in CJCSI 3170.01 and this AFI for CPD development.
7.4. CPD Requirements Correlation Table (RCT). The CPD RCT is a summary of all
required capability characteristics listed as threshold and, if necessary, objective values within
the CPD text. The primary objective of the RCT is to provide a concise summary to assist
requirements traceability and support decision making. Air Force CPD RCTs expand on the
tables required by CJCSI 3170.01 by including “Paragraph Number” and “Rationale and
Analytical References” columns.
   7.4.1. CPD RCT Format. The RCT consists of three separate tables: “Key Performance
   Parameter” (Table 7.1), “Key System Attribute” (Table 7.2), and “Additional Attribute”
   (Table 7.3). All three tables have a similar format with the exception of the subject column
46                                                   AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


  (e.g., “KPP,” “KSA,” and “Additional Attribute”). The following information is required in
  each column for all three tables.
       7.4.1.1. Paragraph Number. Cite the CPD paragraph where text for KPP/attribute is
       located.
       7.4.1.2. Joint Capability Area (JCA) Tier 1/2. Cite the primary Tier 1 and 2 JCA
       (applicable to KPP and KSA tables only).
       7.4.1.3. KPP/KSA/Additional Attributes.           Insert the operational      performance
       characteristic for which the threshold and objective values are identified.
       7.4.1.4. Production Threshold. Insert the minimum acceptable threshold value for the
       corresponding operational performance characteristic below which utility of the subject
       characteristic becomes questionable. The production threshold must be supported by
       analytical rigor that demonstrates its operational utility and the need for resource
       investment. The production threshold must be obtainable, measurable, and testable. If
       the production threshold value is planned to be achieved following completion of
       IOT&E, include a testable value to be achieved/ demonstrated for evaluation during the
       IOT&E.
       7.4.1.5. Production Objective. Only when absolutely necessary, insert the desired
       operational objective value for the corresponding operational performance characteristic
       above threshold value. The production objective value must be supported by analytical
       rigor that demonstrates its operational utility, the need for significant operational
       improvement over threshold value, and the demand for additional resource investment.
       The production objective must be obtainable, measurable, and testable.
       7.4.1.6. Rationale/Analytical References. Briefly summarize (in 3 - 4 bullets) the
       rationale/analytical references of subject KPP/KSA/additional attributes as described
       within the text of the CPD. Identify the rationale for the operational utility and include
       the specific studies, analysis, threat assessments, modeling, or other reference sources
       (including informed military judgments) that justify and substantiate the threshold, and if
       absolutely necessary, objective value.

7.5. CDD in lieu of CPD. A sponsor may submit a CDD to be validated as a CPD in those
cases where the CDD accurately reflects the performance of the system to be delivered at low-
rate initial production, or at build decision for Space systems. When considering a CDD in lieu
of CPD approach, the sponsor must first contact AF/A5RP regarding its feasibility and receive
approval to proceed. If approved, an RSR must occur, HPT and O-6 staffing is waived (in most
cases), and AFROC validation occurs prior to submitting the document to the lead FCB, if
necessary.
7.6. Changes to the CPD. Unlike the CDD, the CPD is always specific to a single increment
and is normally not updated. However, should a CPD update be required, the sponsor must
contact AF/A5RP and, if agreed to, schedule an RSR to determine the Air Force level of review
and approval authority. Proposed changes to KPPs, KSAs, and/or additional attributes must be
accompanied by a funding strategy and schedule that have been coordinated with the appropriate
program office. As a minimum, all changes to KPPs (regardless of ACAT) must be validated at
the AFROC and agreed upon by CSAF (ACAT I) or VCSAF (ACAT II/III). Document
preparation, format, review, validation, approval, and archiving of subsequent updates are
normally the same as the original CPD.
   7.6.1. JROC Interest CPDs. The JROC will approve any change to CPDs having a JPD of
   JROC Interest unless the JROC has specifically delegated approval authority to the Air
   Force. The AFROC must validate any change to a KPP prior to JROC submittal. For all
   other changes, AF/A5R will determine the level of Air Force review and/or validation prior
   to JROC submittal.
   7.6.2. JCB Interest CPDs. The JCB will approve any change to CPDs having a JPD of JCB
   Interest unless the JCB has specifically delegated approval authority to the Air Force. The
   AFROC must validate any change to a KPP prior to JCB submittal. For all other changes,
   AF/A5R will determine the level of Air Force review and/or validation prior to JCB
   submittal.
   7.6.3. Independent, Joint Information, and Joint Integration CPDs. The Air Force will
   approve any change to CPDs having a JPD of Independent, Joint Information, or Joint
   Integration (Table 2.1). The AFROC must validate any change to a KPP prior to Air Force
   approval. For all non-KPP changes, AF/A5R will determine the level of Air Force review
   and/or validation prior to Air Force approval.

                                           Chapter 8

           REQUIREMENTS ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT MODIFICATIONS

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides a description of the operational capability requirements
process activities conducted to support modifications (Figure 8.1). It outlines the requirements
activities required to support the management of modifications for systems fielded and managed
by the Air Force for systems.

Figure 8.1. Activities to Support Modifications.




8.2. Modifications. A modification is an alteration to a configuration item (CI) that, as a
minimum, changes its form, fit, function, or interface. Modifications may be installed as
permanent or temporary alterations, and they may be needed to add new capability to a fielded
system or to sustain existing capability. A new ICD, CDD, CPD is not required to retain or
restore capabilities of fielded systems that have an approved requirements/JCIDS document. For
example, subsystems such as radar, avionics, self protection devices, etc., that have approved
performance threshold/objective parameters but are no longer able to meet those parameters, can
be updated or replaced to meet threshold/objective values under the authority of the approved
requirements/JCIDS document. AFI 63-131 further defines and describes the modification
process and provides guidance and procedures for managing modifications.
   8.2.1. Temporary Modifications. Temporary modifications change the configuration of an
   item to enable short-term operational mission accomplishment, or to support test and
   evaluation of new and modified equipment. When the modification is no longer needed, as
   documented in the AF Form 1067, it is removed and the CI is returned to its permanent
   configuration. An approved AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal, can be used as the
   operational capability requirements documentation for a temporary modification to a system.
   8.2.2. Permanent Modifications. Permanent modifications change the configuration of an
   asset to sustain or effect a lasting improvement in the operational effectiveness, suitability,
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                             49


   survivability, and/or ownership costs of a fielded weapon system, subsystem, or item.
   Permanent modifications are managed as acquisition programs and therefore must satisfy
   approved requirements.
       8.2.2.1. Sustainment Modifications. Permanent sustainment modifications are used to
       retain or restore capabilities, or perform technology refresh of fielded systems. The Lead
       Command should prepare an AF Form 1067, in accordance with AFI 63-131,
       summarizing the modification, providing rationale, and documenting the program
       manager’s engineering and cost assessment. An AF Form 1067 used in this manner
       conforms to previously approved requirements and provides configuration control, but
       does not establish any new requirements.
       8.2.2.2. Capability Modifications.         A permanent capability modification is
       predominantly implemented to satisfy an operational mission requirement by adding a
       new capability or function, or by enhancing technical performance or operational
       suitability of the asset. Capability modifications may also include efforts designed to
       improve the operational availability of the item or to reduce its ownership costs. A
       capability modification usually results in a change to the existing functional baseline or
       item performance specification for that CI. A capability modification may also remove
       components when an existing capability is no longer needed. Requirements for a
       capability modification are established either through a new operational capability
       requirements document or by an AF Form 1067.
8.3. AF Form 1067. An AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal, is used to document the
submission, review, and approval of temporary modifications and permanent sustainment
modifications regardless of cost. An AF Form 1067 can also be used to document the
submission, review, and approval of requirements for permanent capability modifications
estimated to cost no more than ten percent of the minimum threshold dollar values for ACAT II
programs, as described in DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 3. When estimated expenditures exceed ten
percent of ACAT II minimum threshold dollar values ($14M RDT&E or $66M procurement
funding in FY2000 constant dollars); an AF Form 1067 may not be used. In this case, the
sponsor will prepare a new operational capability document unless proposed capability
modification requirements were previously established in an approved CDD or CPD (see Table
8.1).
   8.3.1. AF Form 1067 Approval. The Lead Command and program manager for a system
   must approve AF Forms 1067 for permanent or temporary modifications. Permanent
   modifications projected to cost in excess of $50M in FY 2000 constant dollars are approved
   by AF/A5R to ensure proper reprogramming actions are completed. In this case, the Lead
   Command requirements principal submits the completed AF Form 1067 to AF/A5R via a
   transmittal memo. AF/A5RP coordinates AF Forms 1067 (using established JCIDS
   timelines) with appropriate HAF organizations prior to AF/A5R review and approval.
       8.3.1.1. (Added-AFMC) AF Form 1067 approval will include certification of
       requirements as identified in AFI 63-131, para 4.4.1.10
8.4. Net-Ready (NR) KPP. The JS/J6 must approve permanent modifications that require
interoperability and supportability certification (normally addressed as the NR-KPP in
operational capability documents). For modifications that meet AF 1067 criteria, the sponsor
prepares an AF Form 1067 while the program manager, with the sponsor’s support, updates the
 50                                                   AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


system’s information support plan (ISP). The program manager submits the updated ISP to
JS/J6 to obtain certification. The modification may not be installed until the interoperability and
supportability certification is granted by JS/J6.
8.5. In-Production Systems. An AF Form 1067 is applicable only to items that have been
delivered to the government under a DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report .
If some articles of the in-production system have been delivered and modifications to subsequent
delivery articles are needed, a new or updated operational capability requirements document is
not required unless the modification is driven by a change to the underlying requirement. If the
modification will also be made to the previously delivered articles, an AF Form 1067 or
operational capability requirements document, as appropriate, is used to record the modification
of government owned items.

Terms
Acquisition Category (ACAT)—Categories established to facilitate decentralized decision
making and execution, and compliance with statutorily imposed requirements. The categories
determine the level of review, decision authority, and applicable procedures.
Acquisition Program Baseline (APB)—Each program’s APB is developed and updated by the
program manager and will govern the activity by prescribing the cost, schedule, and performance
constraints in the phase succeeding the milestone for which it was developed. The APB captures
the sponsor capability needs, including the key performance parameters, which are copied
verbatim from the capability development document.
Additional Attribute—A characteristic so significant it must be verified by testing or analysis.
Whenever possible, attributes should be stated in terms that reflect the capabilities necessary to
operate in the full range of military operations and the environment intended for the system,
family of systems (FoS), or system of systems (SoS). Additional attributes must be measurable,
testable, and obtainable, and require AF/A5R approval (or delegate) to change.
Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD)—One method of technology transition. ATDs
are used to demonstrate the maturity and potential of advanced technologies for enhanced
military operational capability or cost effectiveness, and reduce technical risks and uncertainties
at the relatively low costs of informal processes.
AF Form 1067 Modification Proposal—An AF Form 1067 documents the submission, review,
and approval of requirements for modifications to fielded Air Force systems.
Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)—The AoA is an analytical comparison of the operational
effectiveness, suitability, risk, and life-cycle cost of alternatives that satisfy established capability
needs stipulated in an approved ICD. The AoA helps decision makers select courses of action
(COA) to satisfy an operational capability need and supports the development of the initial
requirements correlation table (RCT).
Architecture—(1) The fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their
relationships to each other, and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and
evolution. [IEEE STD 1471-2000]. (2) The structure of components, their relationships and the
principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time Federal Enterprise
Architecture.
Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA)—The CBA is the Joint Capabilities Integration and
Development System analysis process. It answers several key questions for the validation
authority prior to their approval: define the mission; identify capabilities required; determine the
attributes/standards of the capabilities; identify gaps/shortfalls; assess operational risk associated
with the gaps/shortfalls; prioritize the gaps/shortfalls; identify and assess potential non-materiel
solutions; provide recommendations for addressing the gaps/shortfalls.
Capability Development Document (CDD)—A document that captures the information
necessary to develop a proposed program(s), normally using an evolutionary acquisition strategy.
The CDD outlines an affordable increment of militarily useful, logistically supportable, and
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                               59


technically mature capability. The CDD may define multiple increments if there is sufficient
definition of the performance attributes (key performance parameters, key system attributes, and
other attributes) to allow approval of multiple increments.
Capability Gaps—The inability to achieve a desired effect under specified standards and
conditions through combinations of means and ways to perform a set of tasks. The gap may be
the result of no existing capability, lack of proficiency in existing capability, or lack of
sufficiency in existing capability.
Capability Need—A capability identified through the CBA, required to be able to perform a
task within specified conditions to a required level of performance.
Capability Production Document (CPD)—A document that addresses the production elements
specific to a single increment of an acquisition program. The CPD defines an increment of
militarily useful, logistically supportable, and technically mature capability that is ready for a
production decision. The CPD defines a single increment of the performance attributes (key
performance parameters, key system attributes, and other attributes) to support a MS C decision.
Capability Shortfall—A lack of full military utility needed by an operational sponsor to
effectively execute a task.
Capstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO)—The CCJO describes in broad terms the
vision for how the Joint force will operate in response to a wide variety of security challenges
10-20 years in the future. It proposes that future Joint force commanders will combine and
subsequently adapt some combination of four basic categories of military activity—combat,
security, engagement, and relief and reconstruction—in accordance with the unique requirements
of each operational situation. The concept is informed by current strategic guidance, but because
it looks to the future, it is intended to be adaptable, as it must be, to changes in that guidance.
Certification—A statement of adequacy provided by a responsible agency for a specific area of
concern in support of the validation process.
Combatant Commander—A commander of one of the unified or specified combatant
commands established by the President.
Concept Characterization and Technical Description (CCTD)—The CCTD captures
essential information about a prospective materiel approach to address an identified capability
need. CCTD preparation begins when the capabilities planning process (CBA) determines that a
materiel approach may be necessary to address an identified gap. Information in the CCTD can
assist in early decisions associated with narrowing down the analytical trade space of materiel
solutions, and provides the initial technical baseline upon which subsequent analyses and
documents are built. Guidance on CCTD development is available from SAF/AQR.
Concept of Operations (CONOPS)—A verbal or graphic statement, in broad outline, of a
commander’s assumptions or intent in regard to an operation or series of operations. The
CONOPS frequently is embodied in campaign plans and operation plans; in the latter case,
particularly when the plans cover a series of connected operations to be carried out
simultaneously or in succession. The concept is designed to give an overall picture of the
operation. It is included primarily for additional clarity of purpose (also called a commander’s
concept).
 60                                                   AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


Course of Action (COA)—The COA is a planning and decision process that culminates in a
sponsor decision. 'It principally refers to the decision to proceed or not proceed with
development of one or more prospective materiel solutions as informed by an AoA. The COA
includes a series of alternative program choices developed by the MDA or designate, presented
to a sponsor and that once a specific COA is selected, becomes a formal agreement between the
MDA and the operator (usually Lead Command Commander) that clearly articulates the
performance, schedule, and cost expectations of the program. The COA provides the basis for
the Technology Development Strategy during the Technology Development phase.
Defense Business System—The term "defense business system" means an information system,
other than a national security system, operated by, for, or on behalf of the Department of
Defense, including financial systems, mixed systems, financial data feeder systems, and
information technology and information assurance infrastructure, used to support business
activities, such as acquisition, financial management, logistics, strategic planning and budgeting,
installations and environment, and human resource management.
DD Form 250—The DD Form 250 (Material Inspection and Receiving Report) is a
multipurpose report used : (1) provide evidence of acceptance at origin/destination; (2) to
provide evidence of Government contract quality assurance at origin/destination; (3) for supply
packing list(s); (4) for document shipping/receiving; (5) as a contractor invoice; and (6)
commercial invoice support.
DoD 5000 Series—DOD 5000 series refers collectively to DODD 5000.01, DODI 5000.02., the
Defense Acquisition Guide (DAG), and other relevant DoD 5XXX publications.
DoD Components—The DoD components consist of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the
Military Departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the combatant commands, the
Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, the Defense Agencies, DoD Field
Activities, and all other organizational entities within the Department of Defense.
Enabling Concept—Describes how a particular task or procedure is performed, within the
context of a broader functional area, using a particular capability, such as a specific technology,
training or education program, organization, facility, etc. An enabling concept describes the
accomplishment of a particular task that makes possible the performance of a broader military
function or sub-function. See AFPD 10-28, Air Force Concept Development, for further
information on Air Force concepts.
Endorsement—A statement of adequacy, and any limitations, provided by a responsible agency
for a specific area of concern in support of the validation process.
Environment—Air, water, land, living things, built infrastructure, cultural resources, and the
interrelationships that exist among them.
Experiments—Experiments test candidate technologies alone and as components in new
systems and are a critical part of the development of a new technology. Experiments facilitate
the transition of a device from operation in the laboratory to operation as a component or system
in the field.
Evolutionary Acquisition (EA)—Evolutionary acquisition is the preferred DoD strategy for
rapid acquisition of mature technology for the sponsor. An evolutionary approach delivers
capability in increments, recognizing, up-front, the need for a future capability improvements.
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                                61


The objective is to balance needs and available capability with resources, and to put capability
into the hands of the warfighter quickly.
Family-of-Systems (FoS)—A set of systems that provide similar capabilities through different
approaches to achieve similar or complementary effects. For instance, the warfighter may need
the capability to track moving targets. The FoS that provides this capability could include
unmanned or manned aerial vehicles with appropriate sensors, a space-based sensor platform or a
special operations capability. Each can provide the ability to track moving targets but with
differing characteristics of persistence, accuracy, timeliness, etc.
Feasible—A requirement that is technically achievable and executable within the estimated
schedule and budgeted life cycle cost.
Functional Capabilities Board (FCB)—A permanently established body that is responsible for
the organization, analysis, and prioritization of Joint warfighting capabilities within an assigned
functional area.
Full Operational Capability (FOC)—The full attainment of the capability to effectively
employ a weapon system, item of equipment, or system of approved specific characteristics,
which is manned and operated by a trained, equipped, and supported military unit or force. FOC
is not necessarily a date; it defines the criteria necessary to declare full operational capability.
Full-Rate Production—Production of economic quantities following stabilization of the system
design and prove-out of the production process.
Gatekeeper—That individual who makes the initial JPD of operational capability requirements
documents. This individual will also make a determination of the lead and supporting Functional
Capabilities Boards (FCBs) for capability documents. The Gatekeeper is supported in these
functions by the FCB working group leads and the JS/J6. The Joint Staff Deputy Director for
Requirements, JS/J8, serves as the JCIDS Gatekeeper.
Human Systems Integration (HSI)—Includes the integrated and comprehensive analysis,
design and assessment of requirements, concepts and resources for system manpower, personnel,
training, environment, safety, occupational health, habitability, survivability, and human factors
engineering.
Implementing Command—The command (usually Air Force Materiel Command or Air Force
Space Command) providing the majority of personnel in direct support of the program manager
responsible for development, production, and sustainment activities.
Increment—A militarily useful and supportable operational capability that can be effectively
developed, produced or acquired, deployed, and sustained. Each increment of capability will
have its own set of threshold and objective values set by the sponsor. Technology is developed
to a desired maturity and injected into the delivery of an increment of capability.
Information Assurance (IA)—Information operations that protect and defend information and
information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and
non-repudiation. This includes providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating
protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.
Information & Resource Support System (IRSS)—IRSS is web-based Air Force-wide
automated system that provides the requirements community the ability to develop, coordinate,
task, track, and store all operational capability requirements documents (i.e., ICDs, CDDs,
 62                                                    AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


CPDs), along with their associated analysis and briefings, within the Air Force requirements
process. IRSS resides on the Air Force SIPRNET Portal.
Information Support Plan (ISP)—The identification and documentation of information needs,
infrastructure support, IT and NSS interface requirements and dependencies focusing on net-
centric, interoperability, supportability, and sufficiency concerns.
Information System—A discrete set of information resources organized for collection, storage,
processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, disposition, display, or transmission of
information. Includes automated information system (AIS) applications, enclaves, outsourced
IT-based processes, and platform IT interconnections.
Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)—Summarizes the CBA and recommends a materiel
approach or a combination of materiel and non-materiel approaches to satisfy specific capability
gaps/shortfalls. It defines the capability gap(s) in terms of the functional area, the relevant range
of military operations, desired effects, time, and DOTMLPF and policy implications and
constraints. The ICD summarizes the results of the DOTMLPF analysis and the DOTMLPF
approaches (materiel and non-materiel) that may deliver the required capability. The outcome of
an ICD could be one or more Joint DOTMLPF change recommendations or CDDs and/or CPDs.
Initial Operational Capability (IOC)—That first attainment of the capability to employ
effectively a weapon, item of equipment, or system of approved specific characteristics with the
appropriate number, type, and mix of trained and equipped personnel necessary to operate,
maintain, and support the system. It is normally defined in the CDD. NOTE: IOC is event-
driven and not tied to a specific future date.
Integrated Architecture—An architecture consisting of multiple views or perspectives
(operational view, systems view, and technical view) that facilitates integration and promotes
interoperability across family of systems and systems of systems and compatibility among
related architectures.
Intelligence Sensitivity—Any program/initiative that consumes, processes or produces
intelligence information, thereby requiring threat or intelligence infrastructure support, and
which will be measured and evaluated by a program or project office in terms of cost,
performance, and impact on warfighter capabilities and fielding, shall be considered intelligence-
sensitive. If it is likely that, in the future, the program/initiative would produce, consume,
process, or handle intelligence information, then it should be considered intelligence-sensitive.
Intelligence Support—The totality of resources needed to ensure effective operation of a system
once operational from an intelligence perspective. This includes intelligence people, products,
processes, systems, training, and/or facilities.
Interoperability—The ability of systems, units, or forces to provide data, information, materiel,
and services to and accept the same from other systems, units, or forces and to use the data,
information, materiel, and services so exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together.
IT and NSS interoperability includes both the technical exchange of information and the end-to-
end operational effectiveness of that exchange of information as required for mission
accomplishment. Interoperability is more than just information exchange. It includes systems,
processes, procedures, organizations and missions over the life cycle and must be balanced with
information assurance.

Joint Capability Area (JCA)—Collections of like DOD capabilities functionally grouped to
support capability analysis, strategy development, investment decision making, capability
portfolio management, and operational force development and operational planning. See CJCSI
3170.01 for additional information.
Joint Capabilities Board (JCB)—The JCB functions to assist the Joint Requirements Oversight
Council (JROC) in carrying out its duties and responsibilities. The JCB reviews and, if
appropriate, endorses all operational capability requirements and Joint DOTMLPF change
recommendation documents prior to their submission to the JROC. The JCB is chaired by the
Joint Staff Director of Force Structure, Resources and Assessment (JS/J8). It is comprised of
general and flag officer representatives of the Services.
Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD)—A demonstration of the military utility
of a significant new technology and an assessment to clearly establish operational utility and
system integrity.
Joint Force—A general term applied to a force composed of significant elements, assigned or
attached, of two or more Military Departments operating under a single Joint force commander.
Joint Operational Environment—The environment of land, sea, and/or airspace within which a
Joint force commander employs capabilities to execute assigned missions.
Joint Operations Concepts (JOpsC)—JOpsC is a family of Joint Future Concepts consisting of
a Capstone Concept for Joint Operations, Joint Operating Concepts (JOCs), Joint Functional
Concepts (JFCs) and Joint Integrating Concepts (JICs). They are a visualization of future
operations and describe how a commander, using military art and science, might employ
capabilities necessary to successfully meet challenges 8 to 20 years in the future. Ideally, they
will produce military capabilities that render previous ways of warfighting obsolete and may
significantly change the measures of success in military operations overall. JOpsC presents a
detailed description of “how” future operations may be conducted and provides the conceptual
basis for Joint experimentation and capabilities-based assessments (CBAs). The outcomes of
experimentation and CBA will underpin investment decisions leading to the development of new
military capabilities beyond the Future Years Defense Program.
Joint Potential Designator (JPD)—A designation assigned by the Gatekeeper to determine the
Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System validation and approval process and the
potential requirement for certifications and/or endorsements.
1. “JROC Interest” designation will apply to all potential or designated ACAT I/IA programs
and capabilities that have a potentially significant impact on interoperability in allied and
coalition operations. All Joint doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and
education, personnel, and facilities change recommendation (DCR) documents will be
designated JROC Interest. These documents will receive all applicable certifications, including a
weapon safety endorsement when appropriate, and be staffed through the JROC for validation
and approval. An exception may be made for ACAT IAM programs without significant impact
on Joint warfighting (i.e., defense business systems). These programs may be designated Joint
Integration, Joint Information, or Independent.
2. “JCB Interest” designation will apply to all ACAT II and below programs where the
capabilities and/or systems associated with the document affect the Joint force and an expanded
Joint review is required. These documents will receive all applicable certifications, including a
 64                                                   AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


weapon safety endorsement when appropriate, and be staffed through the JCB for validation and
approval.
3. “Joint Integration” designation will apply to ACAT II and below programs where the
capabilities and/or systems associated with the document do not significantly affect the Joint
force and an expanded Joint review is not required. Staffing is required for applicable
certifications (information technology and National Security Systems (NSS) interoperability and
supportability and/or intelligence), and for a weapon safety endorsement, when appropriate.
Once the required certification(s)/weapon safety endorsement are completed, the document may
be reviewed by the FCB. Joint Integration documents are validated by the AFROC and approved
by VCSAF.


4. “Joint Information” designation applies to ACAT II and below programs that have interest or
potential impact across Services or agencies but do not have significant impact on the Joint force
and do not reach the threshold for JROC Interest. No certifications or endorsements are
required. Once designated Joint Information, staffing is required for informational purposes only
and the FCB may review the document. Joint Information documents are validated by the
AFROC and approved by VCSAF.
5. “Independent” designation will apply to ACAT II and below programs where the capabilities
and/or systems associated with the document do not significantly affect the Joint force, an
expanded review is not required, and no certifications or endorsements are required. Once
designated Independent, the FCB may review the document. Independent documents are
validated by the AFROC and approved by VCSAF.
Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM)—Official JROC
correspondence generally directed to an audience(s) external to the JROC — usually decisional
in nature.
Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUON)—An urgent operational need identified by a
combatant commander involved in an ongoing named operation. A JUON’s main purpose is to
identify and subsequently gain Joint Staff validation and resourcing solution, usually within days
or weeks, to meet a specific high-priority combatant commander need. The scope of a
combatant commander JUON will be limited to addressing urgent operational needs that: (1) fall
outside of the established Service processes; and (2) most importantly, if not addressed
immediately, will seriously endanger personnel or pose a major threat to ongoing operations.
They should not involve the development of a new technology or capability; however, the
acceleration of a JCTD or minor modification of an existing system to adapt to a new or similar
mission is within the scope of the JUON validation and resourcing process.
Key Performance Parameter (KPP)—An attribute or characteristic considered critical or
essential to the development of an effective military capability. KPPs must be measurable,
testable, and obtainable, supported by analytic rigor that demonstrates its operational utility and
the need for resource investment. CDD and CPD KPPs are included verbatim in the acquisition
program baseline. KPP changes require VCSAF approval (or delegate).
Key System Attribute (KSA)—An attribute or characteristic considered crucial to achieving a
balanced solution/approach to a capability, but not critical enough to be designated a KPP.
KSAs provide decision makers with an additional level of capability performance characteristics
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                                65


(a priority) below the KPP level. KSAs must be measurable, testable, and obtainable, and
require VCSAF approval (or delegate) to change.
Knowledge Management/Decision System (KM/DS)—An electronic staffing and repository
tool the Joint Staff uses for development and staffing of Joint operational capability requirements
documents.
Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP)—Production of the system in the minimum quantity
necessary (1) to provide production-configured or representative articles for operational tests
pursuant to Title 10 §2399; (2) to establish an initial production base for the system; and (3) to
permit an orderly increase in the production rate for the system sufficient to lead to full-rate
production upon the successful completion of operational testing.
Materiel Development Decision (MDD)—The Materiel Development Decision review is the
formal entry point into the acquisition management system and is mandatory for all programs. At
the MDD, the MDA approves the AoA study guidance; determines the acquisition phase of
entry; identifies the initial review milestone; and designates the lead DoD Component(s).
Materiel Solution—Correction of a deficiency, satisfaction of a capability gap, or incorporation
of new technology that results in the development, acquisition, procurement, or fielding of a new
item (including ships, tanks, self-propelled weapons, aircraft, etc., and related software & data,
spares, repair parts, and support equipment, but excluding real property, installations, and
utilities) necessary to equip, operate, maintain, and support military activities without disruption
as to its application for administrative or combat purposes. In the case of family of systems and
system of systems approaches, an individual materiel solution may not fully satisfy a necessary
capability gap on its own.
Milestones—Major decision points that separate the phases of an acquisition program.
Milestone Decision Authority (MDA)—The individual designated, in accordance with criteria
established by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, the
Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks and Information Integration), for Automated
Information System acquisition programs, or by the Under Secretary of the Air Force, as the
DOD Space MDA, to approve entry of an acquisition program into the next phase.
Militarily Useful Capability—A capability that achieves military objectives through
operational effectiveness, suitability and availability, which is interoperable with related systems
and processes, transportable and sustainable when and where needed and at costs known to be
affordable over the long term.
Modification—An alteration to a configuration item applicable to a warfighter system (i.e.,
aircraft, missiles, support equipment, ground stations software (imbedded), trainers, etc.). As a
minimum, the alteration changes the form, fit, function or interface of the item. A weapon
system is defined as a combination of elements that function together to produce the capabilities
required to fulfill a mission need, including hardware, equipment, software, and all Integrated
Logistics Support elements, but excluding construction or other improvements to real property.
Non-Materiel Solution—Changes in doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and
education, personnel, facilities, or policy (including all human systems integration domains) to
satisfy identified functional capabilities. The materiel portion is restricted to commercial or non-
developmental items that may be purchased commercially or by purchasing more systems from
 66                                                    AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


an existing materiel program. The acquisition of the materiel portion must comply with all
acquisition policies.
Objective Value—Developed only when absolutely necessary, it is the desired operational goal
associated with a performance attribute beyond which any gain in utility does not warrant
additional expenditure. The objective value is an operationally significant increment above the
threshold. An objective value may be the same as the threshold when an operationally
significant increment above the threshold is not significant or useful.
Operating Command—Those commands operating a system, subsystem, or item of equipment.
Operating Concept—A description in broad terms of the application of military art and science
within a defined set of parameters. In simplest terms, operating concepts articulate how a
commander will plan, prepare, deploy, employ or sustain a joint force against potential
adversaries within a specified set of conditions. Operating concepts encompass the full scope of
military actions required to achieve a specific set of objectives. See AFPD 10-28 for further
information on Air Force concepts.
Operational Capability— The ability to achieve a desired effect under specified standards and
conditions through combinations of means and ways across the doctrine, organization, training,
materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) to perform a set of
tasks to execute a specified course of action. It is defined by an operational sponsor and
expressed in broad operational terms in the format of an initial capabilities document or a Joint
DOTMLPF change recommendation. In the case of materiel proposals/documents, the definition
will progressively evolve to DOTMLPF performance attributes identified in the capability
development document and the capability production document.
Operational Capability Requirements Document—An ICD, CDD, CDP, or Joint DCR.
Operational Suitability—The degree to which a system can be placed and sustained
satisfactorily in field use with consideration given to availability, compatibility, transportability,
interoperability, reliability, wartime usage rates, maintainability, environmental, safety and
occupational health, human factors, habitability, manpower, logistics, supportability, natural
environment effects and impacts, documentation, and training requirements.
Operational Effectiveness—Measure of the overall ability to accomplish a mission when used
by representative personnel in the environment planned or expected for operational employment
of the system considering organization, doctrine, supportability, survivability, vulnerability, and
threat.
Operator—An operational command or agency that employs acquired systems for the benefit of
warfighters. Operators may also be warfighters.
Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)—1. The field test, under realistic combat
conditions, of any item of (or key component of) weapons, equipment, or munitions for the
purpose of determining the effectiveness and suitability of the weapons, equipment, or munitions
for use in combat by typical military users; and the evaluation of the results of such test. (Title
10 §139(a)(2)) 2. Testing and evaluation conducted in as realistic an operational environment as
possible to estimate the prospective system's operational capabilities and limitations. In addition,
OT&E provides information on operational effectiveness and suitability, organization, personnel
requirements, doctrine, and tactics. It may also provide data to support or verify material in
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                              67


operating instructions, publications, and handbooks. NOTE: The term OT&E is often
substituted for IOT&E, QOT&E, or FOT&E, and depending on the context, has the same
meaning as those terms.
Partner Nations—Those countries with which the Air Force conducts International Armaments
Cooperation (IAC) programs to harmonize international research, development, test, evaluation,
acquisition, production and support of weapons and weapons-related technology. See AFI 16-
110 for additional information regarding IAC program descriptions, purpose and objectives.
Procurement—Procurement appropriations fund those acquisition programs that have been
approved for production (to include low-rate initial production (LRIP) of acquisition objective
quantities), and all costs integral and necessary to deliver a useful end item intended for
operational use or inventory upon delivery.
Program Manager (PM)—As used in this instruction applies collectively to System Program
Director, Product Group Manager, Single Manager, or acquisition program manager. The PM is
the designated individual with responsibility for and authority to accomplish program objectives
for development, production, and sustainment to meet the sponsor's operational needs. The PM
shall be accountable for credible cost, schedule, and performance reporting to the MDA.
Rapid Response Process (RRP)—An expedited process for documenting and staffing materiel
solutions to urgent, time-sensitive requirements. The process is fully described in AFI 63-114.
Requirements Correlation Table (RCT)—The RCT is a formatted summary of required
capability characteristics with threshold values, and if absolutely necessary, objective values
within the AoA final report, CDD, and CPD text. It supports the development of follow-on
requirements and acquisition documents, and assists operational and system requirements
traceability.
Requirements Manager—A military manager or DOD civilian manager charged with
assessing, developing, validating, and prioritizing requirements and associated requirements
products through the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System process.
Requirements managers are identified by the sponsor and are certified by Defense Acquisition
University upon completion of the appropriate courses.
Sponsor—The organization responsible for documentation, periodic reporting, and funding
actions necessary to support needed capabilities (e.g., MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, etc.).
Stakeholder—personnel or organizations (e.g., warfighters, sponsor, or agencies), who are
actively involved in the development of the capability or whose interests may be positively or
negatively affected by the performance of the capability.
System-of-Systems (SoS)—A set or arrangement of interdependent systems that are related or
connected to provide a given capability. The loss of any part of the system significantly degrades
the performance or capabilities of the whole.
Systems View (SV)—A view that identifies the kinds of systems, how to organize them, and the
integration needed to achieve the desired operational capability. It will also characterize
available technology and systems functionality.
Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP)—Documents the overall structure and objectives of
the T&E program. It provides a framework within which to generate detailed T&E plans and it
documents schedule and resource implications associated with the T&E program. The TEMP
 68                                                 AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


identifies the necessary developmental, operational, and live-fire test activities. It relates
program schedule, test management strategy and structure, and required resources to: critical
operational issues; critical technical parameters; objectives and thresholds documented in the
requirements document; and Milestone decision points.
Threshold—A minimum acceptable operational value below which the utility of the system
becomes questionable.
Validation—The review of documentation by an operational authority other than the sponsor to
confirm the operational capability. Validation is a precursor to approval.
Warfighter—An operational command or agency that receives or will receive benefit from the
acquired system. Combatant commanders and their Service component commands are the
warfighters. There may be more than one warfighter for a system. Because the Service
component commands are required to organize, equip, and train forces for the combatant
commanders, they are seen as warfighters for systems.
NOTE: The purpose of this glossary is to help the reader understand the terms listed as used in
this publication. It is not intended to encompass all terms. See pertinent Joint and Air Force
specific publications for standardized terms and definitions for DoD and Air Force use.

                                    DOCUMENT REVIEW

A2.1. Document Review and Approval. Sponsors are responsible for ensuring a full review of
draft operational capability requirements documents, resolution of issues identified during this
review, and submittal of documents for validation and approval. For operational capability
requirements documents, the extent of this review and designation of the validation and approval
authority is determined by the JPD assigned to the document and the ACAT level of the
program. Staffing flowcharts and guidance are located on the AF/A5RP Requirements web site.
A2.2. Air Force Points of Contact. Each MAJCOM or agency responsible for reviewing
operational capability requirements documents will establish a single office with responsibility
for receiving documents for comment, distributing the document within their organization, and
consolidating and returning comments. For HAF, AF/A5R is the single point of contact for
document reviews. AF/A5R has delegated this authority to AF/A5RP to staff the document to
the appropriate level for HAF review on all ICDs, CDDs, CPDs, Joint DCRs and other Joint-
sponsored documents (i.e., CONOPS, FCB/Gatekeeper reviews, CBAs, etc., including Joint
Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS) documents at the TS/SCI level).
A2.3. Information & Resource Support System (IRSS). IRSS is an automated tool designed
to facilitate developing, staffing, and archiving copies of operational capability requirements
documents. A listing of applicable agencies and offices to be included in all Air Force reviews is
located within IRSS. Sponsors will submit documents and taskings via IRSS to AF/A5RP for
HAF Review, Joint Review, AFROC validation, JROC approval, and to track the history of
document development. AF/A5RP will forward documents and tasking to appropriate HAF and
Joint Staff offices. After a document is approved, the Air Force Requirements Document
Librarian will archive a copy of the document and related information within IRSS. Detailed
information on IRSS procedures and conventions is located on the AF/A5RP Requirements web
site.
A2.4. Air Force Review. AF/A5R has delegated Air Force flag-level review tasking authority
to AF/A5RP for all ICDs, CDDs, CPDs, and Joint DCRs. To accomplish this task, AF/A5RP
subtasks other HAF organizations to obtain the HAF positions. Normally, there is only one
round of Air Force review and comment on an operational capability requirements document.
The intent is for this review to be at the O-6 level, but organizations may elevate the document to
the appropriate level within their chain of command as they see fit. The normal review cycle is
21 calendar days; sponsors must provide justification if a shorter (or longer) review time is
needed.
   A2.4.1. HAF Subject Matter Expert Responsibilities. IRSS maintains a mandatory Air Force
   distribution list for all operational capability requirements document reviews. AF/A5RP
   relies on the HAF SME to identify organizations outside the IRSS distribution list and to
   ensure those organizations have access to the document under review. After coordination is
   complete, AF/A5RP will provide the HAF SME with access to all comments submitted via
   IRSS. The HAF SME is responsible for reviewing and consolidating all comments within
   IRSS. During comment consolidation, the HAF SME reviews each comment to make sure
   there are no duplicate comments. The HAF SME also reviews each comment to ensure they
   are of the correct category (i.e., critical, substantive, administrative) and downgrade from
 70                                                   AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


   critical to substantive or substantive to administrative if necessary. The HAF SME should
   contact the comment submitter before deleting or downgrading any comment.
A2.5. Joint Staff Review/Certifications. Sponsors will submit all draft operational capability
requirements documents through AF/A5RP to the JS/J8 Gatekeeper for Joint review. The
Deputy Director for Requirements (DDR), JS/J8 serves as the JS/J8 Gatekeeper. Documents
developed by an AF/A5R-facilitated HPT are submitted for simultaneous Air Force and Joint
Staff review. The JS/J8 Gatekeeper will designate a lead and any supporting FCBs with
responsibility for the document and formally assign a JPD to the document. JPD designations
are described in CJCSI 3170.01 and determine the level of Joint involvement in the review,
certification, validation, and approval of a document. Table A2.1 depicts the certifications
required prior to approval of a operational capability requirements document. AF Forms 1067
are not submitted for the JS/J8 Gatekeeper process or Joint Staff review.

A2.5.1. JROC Interest documents receive a Joint Phase 1 review (conducted at the O-6 level and
above as designated by the reviewing organization). Following resolution of comments, these
documents are presented to the AFROC for Air Force validation. Following the AFROC, JROC
Interest documents with unresolved critical comments from Phase 1 review, or if directed by the
document’s lead FCB, are submitted for a Joint Phase 2 review (conducted at the flag level).
Applicable certifications are then granted based on resolution of Phase 1 and, if necessary, Phase
2 comments. Upon attaining applicable certifications, documents are submitted for FCB and
JCB review and JROC approval.
   A2.5.2. JCB Interest documents go through the same review process as JROC Interest
   documents, but receive JCB approval instead of JROC approval.
   A2.5.3. Joint Integration documents undergo a three-stage certification process. Stage I
   review is conducted in the same way as Phase 1 review for a JROC Interest document. A
   Stage II review is required only if there are unresolved critical comments from Stage I or if
   directed by the document’s lead FCB. Both Stage I and Stage II reviews are conducted at the
   O-6 level for Joint Integration documents. After resolution of all critical comments from
   previous stages, the sponsor requests final certifications. This is Stage III of the process. All
   certifications for Joint Integration documents must be obtained prior to AFROC review and
   validation.
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                               71


   A2.5.4. Joint Information documents undergo a single stage of Joint review for
   informational purposes and for concurrence on the assigned JPD. Based on this review, the
   JPD may be changed to Joint Integration, JCB Interest, or JROC Interest. Comments
   submitted during the single Joint review on the content of Joint Information documents need
   not be addressed. Joint Information documents do not require any Joint certifications and are
   validated and approved by the Air Force.
   A2.5.5. Independent documents do not undergo Joint review. No Joint certifications are
   required. These are validated and approved by the Air Force.
A2.6. Review of Non-Air Force-Sponsored Operational Capability Requirements
Documents. The JS/J8 forwards all operational capability requirements documents with a JPD
of JROC Interest, JCB Interest, Joint Integration, or Joint Information to AF/A5RP for Air Force
review. Once received, AF/A5RP forwards the document via IRSS to all HAF and MAJCOM
mandatory addressees listed on the Air Force Staffing Distribution list. After review, the HAF
functional organization approves the Air Force position on the document. These documents are
normally staffed only once to the Air Force for review and comment, but a Phase 2 review may
be required if there are unresolved issues from the initial Joint review or if directed by the
document’s lead FCB.
A2.7. Document Coordination and Commenting. Lack of a response from any Air Force
agency tasked to review an operational capability requirements document by the designated
suspense date is considered concurrence (tasking agencies are not required to accept late
comments). Document reviewers will submit comments and identify the significance of the
comment as “critical,” “substantive,” or “administrative.” Convincing support for critical and
substantive comments will be provided in the comment matrix.
   A2.7.1. Critical. A critical comment indicates non-concurrence with the document until the
   comment is satisfactorily resolved. Critical comments are restricted to cost, schedule and
   performance attributes—particularly KPPs and KSAs, concepts of operations, and other
   fundamental issues (such as sustainment, security, or violation of policies and directives) that
   would bring into question the rationale for the document to be approved. Documents with
   unresolved critical comments will not go to the AFROC unless approved by AF/A5R.
   Document reviewers will not make critical comments on issues not related to their area of
   responsibility (substantive comments are allowed, assuming commenter has expertise outside
   their current area of responsibility).
   A2.7.2. Substantive. A substantive comment addresses a section in the document that
   appears to be, or is potentially unnecessary, incorrect, misleading, confusing, or inconsistent
   with other sections. Substantive comments do not indicate non-concurrence, but the
   document sponsor must consider all substantive comments for incorporation.
   A2.7.3. Administrative. An administrative comment addresses typographical, format, or
   grammatical errors. The sponsor should consider all administrative comments.
A2.8. Comment Resolution. Document sponsors will consolidate all critical and substantive
comments into two CRMs; one CRM contains comments from Air Force organizations, and the
second CRM contains comments from the Joint Phase 1 review. A third CRM will be used if a
Joint Phase 2 review is required. Sponsors will use the CRMs to document actions taken in
response to each comment. The document sponsor must show the rationale for not fully
 72                                                  AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


accepting a critical or substantive comment. The sponsor resolves all critical comments before
submitting the document for AFROC review, unless otherwise approved by AF/A5R.
   A2.8.1. Comment Resolution Timing. Per JS/J8 direction, the comment resolution period is
   45 calendar days. If the comment resolution period is deemed excessive (over 45 days),
   JS/J8 or AF/A5R may direct re-staffing.
   A2.8.2. Resolving Critical Comments. Resolve comments at the lowest possible level. If
   the document sponsor disagrees with a critical comment or the resolution requires a
   subjective response from the sponsor, contact the comment originator to work toward a
   mutually agreeable resolution. The method, point of contact (POC), and date of resolution
   must be documented in the CRM (e.g., "via telephone with Maj Smith on [xx] date"). If the
   resolution merely requires the substitution or addition of commenter-provided
   wording, sponsor resolution should indicate the comment was accepted ("A") and state that
   the recommended wording was accepted in its entirety—the comment originator need not be
   contacted.
       A2.8.2.1. Adjudication Procedures. If a critical comment cannot be resolved, the issue is
       elevated as required to achieve final resolution. The intent of the adjudication process is
       to prevent a single office or individual from holding up the document indefinitely. If the
       document sponsor cannot adjudicate the comment with the comment originator, the issue
       is raised to the O-6 level for adjudication. If the comment cannot be resolved at the O-6
       level, the document sponsor requests AF/A5RP support in adjudicating the comment.
       AF/A5RP may present the issue to AF/A5R (as necessary). In rare instances, the
       comment may remain open and be adjudicated at the AFROC. For adjudication issues
       with other Services or the Joint Staff, the HAF SME assists the document sponsor in
       working the issue with the applicable FCB Working Groups and FCBs. In rare cases,
       unresolved issues may be submitted to the FCB, JCB, or JROC for resolution.
A2.9. Document Completion. A signed AFROCM records validation of an Air Force
operational capability requirements document. A signed JROCM records approval of a JROC
Interest or JCB Interest operational capability requirements document. The CSAF approves
ACAT I documents; VCSAF approves ACAT II and ACAT III documents. After document
approval, the document sponsor will provide a copy of the final version to AF/A5RP via IRSS.
AF/A5RP is responsible for entering a copy of the document and all supporting material into the
Requirements Document Library. AF/A5R also forwards a copy to the JS/J8 Gatekeeper for
archiving in KM/DS.

         RESPONDING TO WARFIGHTER URGENT OPERATIONAL NEEDS

This attachment details operational capabilities requirements activities associated with
addressing Warfighter Urgent Operational Needs.

A3.1. Warfighter Urgent Operational Needs. Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) are needs
identified during conflict or crisis situations that are life threatening or combat mission
threatening, are unforeseen military requirements, and must be resolved as soon as practical.
The UON process is intended to field readily available capabilities through accelerated means.
The UON is not intended to be used for requesting non-materiel solutions or force deployments;
however, it may identify a non-materiel approach as the most effective solution.
   A3.1.1. UON Criteria. Organizations submitting or validating a UON must ensure the
   following criteria are met.
       A3.1.1.1. The urgent need has identified a capability gap or shortfall that will result in
       imminent loss of life and/or prevent the successful completion of a critical, near-term
       combat mission.
       A3.1.1.2. The UON origination and submission must come from a Warfighting
       Commander or the Commander’s designated representative.
   A3.1.2. Points of Contact. Each organization listed below will identify a single OPR for
   processing UONs and tracking UON-related activity within their organization:
       A3.1.2.1. AF/A5R is the single HAF POC for operational capability requirements
       activities associated with this process. This includes receipt and HAF distribution of
       warfighter UONs and tracking UON related activities for CSAF.
       A3.1.2.2. SAF/AQXA is the single POC for the Secretariat staff for operational
       capability acquisition activities associated with this process. This includes determination
       of an appropriate acquisition strategy in accordance with the Rapid Response Process
       (RRP) as described in AFI 63-114.
       A3.1.2.3. Air Combat Command (ACC) is the Lead Command for UONs associated
       with air combat capabilities, air-breathing ISR capabilities, combat search and rescue,
       and combat support capabilities.
       A3.1.2.4. Air Mobility Command (AMC) is the Lead Command for UONS associated
       with air mobility capabilities.
       A3.1.2.5. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) is Lead Command for
       UONs associated with special operations capabilities.
       A3.1.2.6. Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is Lead Command for UONs associated
       with space and cyberspace-related capabilities.
       A3.1.2.7. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) is the Lead Command for UONs
       associated with nuclear and global strike capabilities.
 74                                                  AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


       A3.1.2.8. Implementing commands, AFSPC and Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC),
       will assist the Lead Command in identifying potential solutions, developing the
       acquisition strategy, and test and evaluation strategy.
A3.2. Requirements Activities Associated with UON Identification. The Air Force UON
process begins when a Warfighting Commander identifies a capability gap/shortfall and submits
a UON.
   A3.2.1. UON Format. A recommended format (see Attachment 4) for submission of a
   UON is provided with this attachment. SIPRNET e-mail is the preferred method of
   notification. The warfighter is encouraged to provide as much information as possible
   including possible or preferred solutions as well as any constraints that might affect the
   choice of a solution.
       A3.2.1.1. UON Mandatory Distribution List. UONs must be submitted to the
       appropriate Lead Command (ACC/A8, AMC/A5/8, AFSPC/A5, AFSOC/A5,
       AFGSC/A5), SAF/AQX workflow, and AF/A5R workflow. Courtesy copies must be
       provided to AFMC/A5C workflow and AFSPC/A5X workflow.
   A3.2.2. Early Notification. To facilitate mutual understanding of the need and expeditious
   identification of a satisfactory solution, warfighters are encouraged to contact the appropriate
   Lead Command as early as possible if a UON submission is being considered.
   Representatives from the warfighter, Lead Command, HAF subject matter experts, AF/A5R,
   SAF/AQX, and the program manager must work together to meet desired timelines.
   A3.2.3. UON Validation. The Lead Command is responsible for validation of the
   warfighter’s request as a UON against the previously stated criteria. If the request is not
   valid, the Lead Command will notify the requestor, SAF/AQX and AF/A5R within five
   calendar days.
A3.3. Requirements Activities Associated with Identifying a UON Solution.
   A3.3.1. Pre-Course of Action Discussions. Upon receipt of a UON, the Lead Command, in
   discussions with SAF/AQX and AF/A5R, must first determine that the correct Lead
   Command has been identified and tasked. If not, the UON should be re-assigned and
   forwarded by the contacted Lead Command to the appropriate Lead Command with a
   courtesy copy provided to the submitting Warfighting Commander.
   A3.3.2. Course of Action Development. Lead Commands will include appropriate HAF
   organizations when developing a course of action to deliver the required capability to the
   warfighter. The course of action must identify a technical solution, funding source(s),
   acquisition activities, test and evaluation requirements, and requirements strategies needed to
   field a capability. The selected course of action should provide the minimum number of
   articles to the warfighter’s theater of operations needed to satisfy the UON. This process is
   not intended for equipping forces worldwide or modifying an entire fleet. The Lead
   Command will notify the requestor, SAF/AQX and AF/A5R of the selected course of action
   or status of the Lead Command’s response within five calendar days of receipt of a
   warfighter’s UON.
       A3.3.2.1. Additional Lead Command Considerations.           When selecting a COA, the
       following criteria apply.
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                              75


         A3.3.2.1.1. The capability provided in response to the UON should be fielded within
         180 days of the initial warfighter request and impact an ongoing conflict or crisis
         situation.
         A3.3.2.1.2. The capability provided in response to the UON should be supportable
         and sustainable, in the near term, within existing support structure.
  A3.3.3. Technical Strategy. The Lead Command will work with the implementing
  command (AFMC or AFSPC) to identify and evaluate one or more potential solutions to the
  UON. Delivering required capabilities in time to meet the warfighter’s need date is the prime
  consideration in selecting a solution, but Lead Commands and warfighters must also consider
  risk, affordability, supportability, technical maturity, compatibility with existing systems and
  concepts, compatibility with other planned modernizations, and any sponsor constraints.
  Consider the following possibilities when developing solutions.
     A3.3.3.1. Non-materiel solutions such as changes to training practices, tactics, or
     operational or employment concepts.
     A3.3.3.2. Permanent or temporary (T-1) modifications to an existing system
     A3.3.3.3. Integrating a new munition or sub-system on an existing system.
     A3.3.3.4. Purchasing additional articles of a fielded system or an off the shelf purchase
     of a government owned or commercial system.
     A3.3.3.5. Accelerating delivery of an already planned system or capability.
     A3.3.3.6. Acquiring a new system.
  A3.3.4. Funding Strategy. There is no dedicated funding source to address warfighter
  UONs. The Lead Command is responsible for sourcing funds and will give UONs priority
  over other funding requirements. A funding strategy must include sustainment of the
  proposed capability until it is terminated or transitions to an established acquisition program.
  The Program Element for systems or missions affected by the UON should be considered the
  primary source of funding. If this is not feasible, the Lead Command will seek assistance
  from SAF/AQXR, SAF/FMBI, and appropriate program offices, Program Executive
  Officers, and Program Element Monitors to source and ensure availability of funds from
  investment appropriations (i.e., 3600, 3010, 3080, etc). Lead Commands do not normally
  have sufficient insight into these accounts to identify under-executing programs that might
  provide the best funding solution.
  A3.3.5. Acquisition Strategy. For materiel solutions, the Lead Command will work with the
  implementing command and SAF/AQXR to determine an appropriate acquisition strategy.
  A3.3.6. Test and Evaluation Strategy. The Lead Command should work with the
  implementing command and AF/TE to determine an appropriate test and evaluation strategy.
  Consider requesting a temporary increase in the resource priority rating for the proposed
  solution in accordance with AFI 16-301, US Air Force Priority System for Resources
  Management, if needed to access test resources. Reference AFI 63-104, The SEEK EAGLE
  Program, if aircraft-stores certification will be required.
 76                                                  AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011


   A3.3.7. Requirements Strategy. Various types of acquisition approaches may be used to
   address a warfighter’s UON. The type of documentation depends on the acquisition
   approach.
       A3.3.7.1. AF Form 1067. Requirements for temporary or permanent modifications to
       existing systems (in theater) can be documented with an AF Form 1067. When using an
       AF Form 1067 to satisfy a UON, Block 9 of the form will contain the statement “This
       modification is needed to address an Urgent Operational Need.” and reference the
       specific request.
       A3.3.7.2. Pre-approved JCIDS Document. If a requirement already exists for the
       intended solution to a UON such as through an approved CDD or CPD, no additional
       requirements document is needed.
       A3.3.7.3. Acceleration of Planned or New Acquisition. Accelerating a previously
       planned or new acquisition may be accomplished by providing direction to the
       appropriate acquisition activity. This may include initiating the Rapid Response Process
       outlined in AFI 63-114.
       A3.3.7.4. Normal JCIDS documentation. Use of normal JCIDS process will be required
       when an urgent need has been approved; however, technology, funding, etc., does not
       exist to rapidly meet the warfighter requirement. This will delay the fielding of the
       solution and should be clearly communicated to the warfighting commander, AF/A5R
       and SAF/AQX.
       A3.3.7.5. Implementation of the Rapid Response Process. If the Lead Command
       approves the UON but requires HAF involvement to complete the necessary course of
       action, the Lead Command will submit the original UON to SAF/AQX and AF/A5R
       along with the request to initiate the Rapid Response Process, as described in AFI 63-
       114.
A3.4. Requirements Activities Associated with Sustaining or Disposing of a UON
Solution. The Lead Command may elect to sustain the solution and transition the interim
capability into an acquisition program or dispose of the solution. Capabilities will terminate or
transition to an acquisition program within two years of fielding. Lead Commands should begin
planning as early as possible for the ultimate disposition of UON solutions.
   A3.4.1. Transition to an Acquisition Program. When needed, the Lead Command will
   process the appropriate JCIDS documents (ICD, CDD and CPD) to establish requirements
   for a permanent acquisition program. It may be appropriate to request an ICD waiver and
   proceed directly to a CDD or CPD based on the demonstrated utility of the solution in actual
   operations. Requirements for permanent modifications may be documented with an AF
   Form 1067 and no further JCIDS documentation is needed.
   A3.4.2. Disposal. The Lead Command will notify the program manager if the capability
   will not be retained beyond the immediate crisis. At the end of its useful life, the capability
   will be demilitarized and disposed of in accordance with all legal and regulatory
   requirements. See DoDI 5000.02.
A3.5. Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUON). A JUON is an urgent need identified by a
warfighting commander that require synchronization across multiple Service/agency providers to
AFI 10-601_AFMCSUP_I 14 JUNE 2011                                                         77


ensure complete and timely combat capability is provided to the Joint warfighter. JUONs are
submitted to the Joint Staff J-8 under the guidance of CJCSI 3470.01, Rapid Validation and
Resourcing of Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) in the Year of Execution. SAF/AQX is
the single AF POC for receipt of JUONs from the Joint Staff J-8. If a JUON is assigned to the
Air Force, either as Sponsor or Co-Sponsor, SAF/AQX will forward the JUON to the appropriate
Lead Command and AF/A5R within 5 calendar days. JUONs will be processed in the same
manner as UONs.

   WARFIGHTER URGENT OPERATIONAL NEEDS - RECOMMENDED FORMAT

   NOTE: This is a recommended format. The distribution addressees are mandatory.
   Requests should focus on identifying a capability gap or shortfall and any constraints that
   might impact selection of a solution. This format is provided to help the warfighter
   communicate the need. It is the Lead Command’s responsibility to determine the best
   solution for filling the capability gap/shortfall. To ensure full understanding of the need
   and realistic expectations, the warfighter should contact the Lead Command as early as
   possible when considering submission of a UON. This early contact should include
   recommended verbiage when filling out this format.
