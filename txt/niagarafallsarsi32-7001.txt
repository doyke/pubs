SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision generally updates policies and procedures to the installation HAZMAT
management program and the operation of the HAZMAT pharmacy. Due to the applicability of
this instruction to the 914AW and the 107AW and tenant units on base, this document is being
revised and must be completely reviewed.
1. Concept of Operations: The Installation HAZMAT Management Program (IHMP) will
serve as the installation focal point for hazardous material management. The IHMP staff will
combine many of the traditional functions of the Bio-Environmental Services (BES), the Civil
 2                                     NIAGARAFALLSARSI32-7001 28 FEBRUARY 2011


Engineering-Environmental (CEV), Contracting (LGC), Safety (SE), Communications (SC), and
Supply to accomplish its goals. To partially standardize the operation of the IHMP with the
organizational structure implemented within the active duty Air Force, the 914th AW will align
this function under the Mission Support Group Commander. The IHMP team will be the sole
contact point for all customers within the 914 AW (Host), the 107 AW(Tenant), the BOS
contractor (914 AW), and the State (107th ANG) , and all tenant units who store/use HAZMART
controlled hazardous materials on this installation.

       2.7.7. Provide recycling containers to be located at the base HAZMART and any other
       designated location (s). These containers should be secured with keys provided to the LG,
       SG, and CE pharmacy members.
3. Procedures:
     3.1. The 914 AW and Tenant HAZMART customers will adhere to the following
     procedures:
       3.1.1. All Hazardous Material and Ozone Depleting Chemicals managed by the
       HAZMART in the SBSS system will be physically processed through the respective Base
       Supply (914 AW and Tenant) Receiving Section and be delivered to the HAZMART for
       storage or further distribution. The LGS BOS function will store and segregate the
       materials IAW AFJMAN 23-209, the MSDSâ€™s, BES and Base Fire Department
       recommendation. All containers of hazardous materials will be bar coded and input into
       the Air Force approved tracking system by HAZMART personnel.
       3.1.2. Prior to requesting a HAZMART managed material customers will ensure that
       proper coordination and approval has been accomplished with the IHMP staff, through
       the Air Force approved tracking system... Upon approval, the IHMP staff will be notified
       of the request through the Air Force approved tracking system or HAZMART desk. It is
       at this time that the HAZMART must be informed of the customerâ€™s account (914AW or
       107AW). The request will first be filled by HAZMART personnel from the free-issue
       stock if available. These free-issue stocks are joint 914th and tenant co-assets.
       3.1.3. When materials are not available in the free-issue stock, the LGS BOS
       HAZMART personnel will input the request with a Transaction Identification Code
       (TRIC) of ISU through the respective SBSS terminal/s using a unique shop code to
       identify the item as a Pharmacy managed asset. This input will then generate an issue,
       partial issue and remaining backorder (DUO), 286 Reject, or a management notice (kill
       notice) of unavailability in the respective segregated 914AW or 107AW item record
       stock locations. Dependent upon the exception coding of the material further action will
       be taken compliant with the requirements of that specific coding, to requisition (SPR) that
       material.
       3.1.4. If the material is issued, BOS/LGS personnel will deliver the property in the same
       time frames established in AFMAN 23-110, Vol. II Part Two. The customer may
       physically pick up materials at any time. Customers must insure that proper planning and
       time is allotted with respect to their respective tasks or jobs in order to properly forecast
       upcoming hazardous material needs.
       3.1.5. Except for bench stock materials, the customer will have five working days to
       return the container empty, used, or unused to the HAZMART unless the container is
       being disposed of, destroyed, etc. At this time the HAZMART will be notified of the bar
       code serial number on the container in question. The BOS/ LGS will maintain an
       automated program to track outstanding materials in the customerâ€™s possession requiring
       return. The HAZMART will notify these customers after the five days have elapsed to
       return the containers immediately. Only legible bar coded containers will be accepted by
       the HAZMART (see 4.1).
NIAGARAFALLSARSI32-7001 28 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       7


     3.1.6. The LGS BOS will maintain a list of locations and buildings where pick up points
     are located. Material pick upâ€™s and returns will be accomplished within two working days
     of notification by the customer.
     3.1.7. All recyclable materials managed by the HAZMART will be recycled by the
     HAZMART if possible. Containers returned that are to be disposed of as hazardous waste
     will be stored in a transitory holding area and the CEV (IHMP) representative will be
     notified for packaging, processing and ultimate disposal. In addition, if a determination
     regarding proper disposal of an empty container(s) cannot be made, notify the CEV or
     SGPB office for assistance.
  3.2. The BOS Contractor, Federal, the State (107th ANG), and NAF (Non-Appropriated
  Fund) functions will adhere to the following procedures:
     3.2.1. The purchase/requisition of all HAZMAT materials must be approved by the
     IHMP staff through the Air Force approved tracking system prior to ordering. In this
     respect the IHMP staff will be able to track and allow only materials that meet the
     allowable requirements of the installation threshold criteria, to be purchased and brought
     on the installation.
     3.2.2. Any hazardous materials that these customers wish to retain in their sections, as
     bench stock will only be approved if requested on the remarks section of the AF Form
     3952. Authorizations for Bench Stock Material will be based on one year usage.
        3.2.2.1. On hand quantities of bench stock material for these customers shall not
        exceed 90 days requirement. This includes both material in the shop and
        material located in the HAZMART Pharmacy.
     3.2.3. The HAZMART will provide containment storage locations for the use of these
     customers. All HAZMART managed materials will be properly stored and segregated
     IAW AFOSH, OSHA, and Air Force compliance standards.
     3.2.4. Once the materials have been purchased locally or received otherwise,
     immediately upon entering this installation they will proceed to the HAZMART for bar
     coding and storage labeling of the containers and input of the data required on these
     materials into the Air Force approved tracking system. As the materials are now being
     tracked, the HAZMART must then be notified of any location changes of the material
     (within shops, etc.). When the work order or job is completed, personnel from the
     contractor or State (107th ANG) will return the used/partial containers back into their
     containment cell in the HAZMART or properly dispose of as a hazardous waste with
     CEV after clearing the bar coded container with the HAZMART. Only legible bar coded
     containers will be accepted by the HAZMART.
     3.2.5. When residue stock in the containment cells is required by the contractor or State
     (107th ANG) the HAZMART will be notified via telephone, e-mail, person to person,
     etc. that entry into the HAZMART warehouse is requested to pick up materials.
     HAZMART personnel will make every attempt to accommodate and make available the
     time if possible for this request. Materials requisitioned by the contractor or State (107th
     ANG) through the Base Supply system (MSNâ€™s- Material Stock Numbers) will be
     received by the respective Base Supply, delivered to the HAZMART then picked up at
     the HAZMART when bar coding and data input is accomplished. These materials, when
 8                                       NIAGARAFALLSARSI32-7001 28 FEBRUARY 2011


        residue is left, will be put in the possession of the installation free-issue containment cell.
        Because these materials are government purchased items and the main users are the
        contractor and the State (107th ANG) these materials will be issued to these customers
        from the free issue stock maintained for the 914th and 107th and other tenants if required.
4. Special Procedures will be handled as follows:
     4.1. Missing or illegible containers:
        4.1.1. If containers of material are illegible due to the bar-coding label being damaged or
        destroyed the shops will make every effort to identify which bar coded serial numbered
        item the material is. These containers will not be put into the pick-up points or returned
        physically to the HAZMART until they are identified. Contact the HAZMART and
        through a research process using the software tracking program and/or process of
        elimination this item will be re-identified with its original tracking label. Missing
        containers will be handled in the same manner, except that the reason, barcode number,
        and disposition of the material and container must be provided to the HAZMART for
        tracking purposes.
     4.2. Local Purchase walks through and Issues:
        4.2.1. When a HAZMART managed Hazardous Material is required and must be
        purchased locally, the customers will submit the request through the HAZMART desk.
        HAZMART personnel will ensure that coordination through the IHMP staff is
        accomplished for approval. Once approved for purchase, the customer may make the
        purchase using the Government GPC card when within cardholderâ€™s authorized purchase
        limits.
     4.2.2. For customer local purchase walkthroughs the HAZMART must instruct the customer
     to bring the material immediately to the HAZMART once the purchase has been made for
     barcoding and tracking upon entering the installation.
     4.3. Lateral Shipments:
        4.3.1. When a shipment, (SHP, FTX, A5J, etc.) document is generated by the machine or
        manually for a HAZMART managed material, the respective Base Supply will contact
        the HAZMART and notify them of the material stock number and quantity required.
        After accomplishing this contact the delivery person will make arrangements to pick up
        the property for transferring to the transportation section for ultimate shipment or
        disposal.
     4.4. The five day return criteria have elapsed and additional time is needed to utilize the
     material:
        4.4.1. In the event that a hazardous material is required for longer than the five day
        criteria, the customer will notify the HAZMART and request an extension or reissue of
        that property to their account before the 5 days have elapsed. All valid and justified
        criteria requests will be approved by the IHMP staff.
     4.5. Using the unique shop code for HAZMART managed materials:
        4.5.1. In order to properly and readily identify a HAZMART managed hazardous
        material all organizations must be distinguished by their own HAZMART shop code. To
NIAGARAFALLSARSI32-7001 28 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       9


     accomplish this task, IHMP personnel will establish all customer accounts with a second
     position shop code character of X. All customers calling in or preparing ordering
     documentation will use the first position of their present shop code with the HAZMART
     identifier of X in the second position. For example, Flight Line Maintenance is FL and
     the HAZMART shop code would be FX. If there are conflicting first position characters
     within the same organization code a new HAZMART shop code will be established.
  4.6. After hours/off duty operation and support services for the 914 AW and 107AW:
     4.6.1. If material is required during off duty hours, the BOS contractor shall respond to
     requests as directed by the ACO (Administrative Contracting Officer). The afterhours
     notification designation policy letter will be on hand and available. Notification of BOS
     personnel will be IAW this letter.
  4.7. After hours/off duty operation and support for BOS Contractor and Tenant personnel:
     4.7.1. If the material required is in the respective containment bin, a recall roster is in
     effect to procure the needed materials. If a material is required that is not available in
     their respective containment cells for emergency jobs, the material can be purchased
     locally and used on the affected task. The next working day as soon as possible the BES
     (IHMP) must be notified and the material must be brought to the HAZMART for bar
     coding and tracking action.
  4.8. Deployment Contingencies:
     4.8.1. When a pre-planned deployment is forecast and known, the requesting customer
     will notify in writing, unless a mobility shop is set up in the program, the quantity, type,
     and time required for that hazardous material. The containers for these materials should
     be returned to the HAZMART within 5 workdays from re-deployment if possible. If the
     containers could not be brought back to this Installation, the HAZMART must be notified
     of what disposition the materials undertook, and the barcoded serial numbers of the
     materials in question. For emergency deployments the HAZMART will attempt to
     provide the customer with any and all materials requested as soon as possible but the
     same criteria needs to be accomplished while on and after the deployment.
  4.9. Host Tenant Organizations:
     4.9.1. If any HAZMART managed materials are brought onto the installation by any
     tenant, the IHMP staff must be notified immediately.
  4.10. GPC (Government Purchase Card) Procedures:
     4.10.1. When a HAZMART managed Hazardous Material is required and is not
     available in the free issue area or through normal SBSS avenues, the customer will fill
     out and request from the HMP an appropriate GPC authorization request and have the
     proper HAZMART coordination signatures obtained on it. Once approved, the customer
     may purchase the material, and upon entering the installation bring the material to the
     HAZMART for bar coding and database input. As on all material requests, an
     authorization request through the Air Force approved tracking system is required in order
     to load the proper authorization record into the HAZMART tracking system.
  4.11. Off site Contractors performing installation projects:
 10                                   NIAGARAFALLSARSI32-7001 28 FEBRUARY 2011


      4.11.1. The contractor shall provide MSDSs to the appropriate base functions prior to
      bringing hazardous materials on base. The respective (107th, and tenant) CE and LGC
      functions will monitor the contractor materials utilized on base projects. Upon
      completion of the project, the contractor will provide a detailed list of materials by type
      and quantity to CE or LGC, and the BOS/LGS IHMP personnel will input the provided
      usage data into the Air Force approved tracking system.
