This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-4, Operations Planning: Air
& Space Expeditionary Force (AEF). It establishes guidelines to secure Wing approval and
identify functional area(s) in order to provide support to outside agencies requesting the use of
Westover ARB facilities. The 439 LRS/LGRR is the initial point of contact for all non-wing
organizations (military or civilian) requesting use of Westover ARB facilities or logistical
support for a short term event. This instruction applies to all base organizations involved in
event support. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847 to 439 LRS/LGRR, 550 Hangar
Avenue, Box 45, Westover ARB, MA 01022-1730.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication updates the request of base use process and reflects current verbiage. Wing XP
function is an outdated term. Logistics Plans in the functional area for this program. From this
point on, the process will be known as the 439th Airlift Wing (439 AW) Sentry Program in order
to differentiate from the Gate Keeper term associated with the responsibilities of the 439 AW/
CCX function.
