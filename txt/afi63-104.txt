This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 63-1, Capability-Based Acquisition Sys-
tem, and introduces the SEEK EAGLE (SE) Program and the Aircraft-store Compatibility Enterprise
(ACE) concept. The SE Program is the standard for the aircraft-stores certification process of the US Air
Force. The SE program can also be used in support of aircraft-stores certification of US and foreign-origin
weapons and stores acquired via Foreign Military Sales or Direct Commercial Sales (FMS or DCS,
respectively), for use on foreign-owned or leased US-origin aircraft. This program assures aircraft-store
compatibility [store loading, safe carriage, separation, safe escape, electromagnetic compatibility/electro-
magnetic interference (EMC/EMI)], and weapon delivery accuracy verification. It includes engineering
analyses, computer simulations, wind tunnel tests, and flight tests to obtain the data needed to verify accu-
racy of and/or update Operational Flight Programs and Technical Orders (TO). It applies to all Active, Air
National Guard (ANG), and US Air Force Reserve operational units; USAF aircraft leased to foreign air
forces; and, foreign-owned aircraft (whether acquired FMS or DCS) when these customers request SE
support in the aircraft-stores certification processes. Ensure that all records created as a result of this AFI
are maintained in accordance with AFPD 37-1, Information Management, and AFMAN 37-123, Manage-
ment of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil. The ACE concept includes all organizations that contribute to
successful execution of the SE mission. This AFI does not adopt or prescribe the use of any forms.

                                                 Chapter 1

                                      PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

1.1. SE Certification. SE certification will be accomplished on all weapons (conventional and nuclear),
deployable countermeasures (chaff, flares, towed decoys, etc.) suspension equipment, tanks, and pods
carried externally or internally. The process includes safe load and unload procedures; flight limits for
safe carriage, employment, jettison, safe escape, and ballistic accuracy verification. Recertification is
required for any change in hardware or software that alters the aerodynamic, structural, or electromag-
netic characteristics of the aircraft or store, or the ejection characteristics of the suspension equipment as
identified in paragraphs A2.2. and A2.3.. SE certification forms part of the USAF airworthiness certifica-
tion process (in accordance with AFPD 62-6, USAF Aircraft Airworthiness Certification, and
MIL-HDBK-516A, Airworthiness Certification Criteria), which is also part of assuring compliance with
Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&E) as directed by AFI 63-1201, Assurance of
Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness.
    1.1.1. SE certification does not include:
       1.1.1.1. Nuclear safety certification described in AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear Safety Certifica-
       tion Program, the nuclear certification process in accordance with AFI 63-125, or the certification
       required before the Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB).
       1.1.1.2. Avionics, electrical, and mechanical integration of the operational interfaces between an
       aircraft and a store.
       1.1.1.3. Development or modification of aircraft or stores to achieve the aircraft-store configura-
       tions certified under SE.
       1.1.1.4. Certification/Accreditation or Information Assurance Verification of weapons or stores
       that connect to classified or unclassified aircraft data buses, either for USAF aircraft or for-
       eign-possessed aircraft of US origin—a flight clearance granted under the SE program does not
       necessarily permit use of stores with unlimited data bus connectivity unless steps have been taken
       to verify information assurance.
    1.1.2. See Attachment 2, Criteria for Aircraft-Store Certification, for details.

1.2. Types of Certifications. There are four types of certifications: quick reaction certifications, routine
certifications, limited certifications, and flight clearances.

1.3. The Process. During the Concept Refinement, Technology Development and System Development
and Demonstration (SDD) phases, the using commands identify initial aircraft-store configuration
requirements in the Initial Capability Document (ICD), Capability Production Document (CPD) and the
Capability Development Document (CDD) in accordance with the established capabilities based require-
ments process. After SDD, a new phase begins with a user request, referred to as a SEEK EAGLE
Request (SER), and ends with the publication of TOs and verification of ballistic inputs to operational
flight programs (OFP) (Exception: operational test flight clearance SERs are not published in TOs). The
Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO) manages all certification activities after SDD and provides
compatibility advice during SDD. In accordance with the OSS&E specifications of AFI 63-1201, the air-
craft Program Manager (PM) is the final certification authority for aircraft and store configurations. See
Chapter 3, for details of the process.
AFI63-104 21 JANUARY 2005                                                                                5


1.4. SE and Systems Acquisition.
   1.4.1. Program managers must initiate SE planning prior to Milestone B for both aircraft and weapon/
   store programs and develop a SE Certification Plan, which includes:
      1.4.1.1. Aircraft-store compatibility issues addressed during SDD trade-off studies.
      1.4.1.2. The SE test activities planned during SDD.
      1.4.1.3. The plan to develop and sustain an organic Air Force store certification capability for the
      weapon system (exit criteria for the Milestone C Air Force review).
   1.4.2. The Milestone B Air Force review requires completion of a SE Certification Plan with AFSEO
   coordination. The applicable operational command must submit a SER by Milestone B to identify the
   threshold aircraft-store configurations required for certification before initial operational capability
   (IOC).

1.5. SE Funding:
   1.5.1. AFMC establishes responsibility for SE funding. Inventory stores and developmental or modi-
   fied inventory stores on inventory aircraft is per Attachment 3 and in line with current AFMC guid-
   ance.
   1.5.2. Threshold configuration requirements on developmental aircraft and store programs are the
   responsibility of the developing program office.
   1.5.3. Developmental stores that are threshold configuration requirements on developmental aircraft
   are according to program office agreements.
   1.5.4. Funding for SE support of activities associated with foreign aircraft-stores certification (US or
   foreign-origin weapons/stores on US-origin aircraft) can be obtained by including a line written into
   an FMS aircraft sale Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) or by establishing an FMS case purely to
   support an aircraft-stores certification effort. SAF/IA, through the Air Force Security Assistance Cen-
   ter (AFSAC), is responsible for identifying funding sources available for SE efforts aimed at foreign
   customers.

1.6. Aircraft-store Compatibility Enterprise (ACE):
   1.6.1. The ACE includes all organizations that contribute to the successful execution of the SE mis-
   sion. This includes: SAF/AQP, SAF/IA, HQ USAF/XOR, AFSEO, aircraft and store PMs, AAC/NW,
   AFMC test centers, operational commands, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
   defense contractors, educational institutions, and many other organizations tasked with aircraft/stores
   compatibility issues.
   1.6.2. The purpose of the ACE is to tie national capabilities into a seamless process to complete air-
   craft-stores certification. The ACE develops and delivers warfighting capability through a collabora-
   tive spirit and reduces parochial focus among participants. It minimizes duplication of effort and
   maximizes the pay-off of capital investments made by enterprise members as embodied in the follow-
   ing mission statement.
   1.6.3. The mission of the ACE is to provide timely and accurate aircraft/store compatibility decisions
   to meet the needs of our nation's warfighters through open dialog and sharing of horizontally inte-
   grated national resources and knowledge.

                                                 Chapter 3

                                             PROCEDURES

3.1. Quick-Reaction Certification (QRC). Submit SERs for QRC, including total ballistics weapon
system accuracy verification, for urgent and mission essential, worldwide aircraft-store certification
requirements. QRCs take precedence over all previously submitted routine certification requirements.
QRCs are intended to support actual contingency or warfighting requirements.

3.2. Routine Certification. Submit SERs for routine certification for non-urgent, worldwide air-
craft-store certification requirements. Limited certification may be requested as a part of this routine cer-
tification. See Attachment 1 for definition of limited certification. AFSEO executes according to the Air
Force SE priority list.

3.3. Flight Clearance. Submit SERs for flight clearances for specific, limited operational or test pur-
poses. Since a flight clearance is a limited authorization to specific units, valid only for a specified dura-
tion, configuration requirements based on wartime plans should be planned for and requested as a routine
certification or QRC. Flight clearances will be worked on a priority basis.

3.4. Integrated Air Force Priority List. In conjunction with the SEWG meetings, representatives from
all Air Force user commands will update the integrated Air Force SE priority list. This list integrates all
user requirements into a single priority list and establishes the precedence the AFSEO will use to conduct
certifications. The Combat Air Forces (CAF), excluding the HQ AFSOC and HQ AMC portion, and for-
eign air force efforts will be aligned with ACC's SE priority list.

3.5. SE Request :
   3.5.1. The user submits a SER to the MAJCOM SE focal point. See Attachment 4.
   3.5.2. Each MAJCOM focal point (SAF/IA for FMS cases) approves the SER and forwards the SER
   (with MAJCOM priority) to HQ ACC/DRP for integration into the Air Force SE priority list.
   3.5.3. HQ AFSOC and HQ AMC submit QRCs direct to AFSEO with information copy to HQ ACC/
   DRP.
   3.5.4. After prioritization, HQ ACC/DRP submits SERs to the AFSEO, applicable aircraft and store
   program offices and cognizant MAJCOM, with user need date, if applicable. Use Attachment 8.
       3.5.4.1. For developmental aircraft, HQ ACC/DRP submits a SER to the AFSEO, applicable air-
       craft program office and cognizant MAJCOM during SDD phase to ensure the AFSEO budgets
       for necessary tools and stores. The SER will direct the aircraft program office and the AFSEO to
       coordinate a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to define store certification responsibilities NLT
       SDD phase. Use Attachment 8.
   3.5.5. AFSEO develops a project plan (Attachment 9) based on the Air Force SE priority list and for-
   wards it to the requesting MAJCOM, HQ ACC/DRP, and SAF/AQP; and, to SAF/IA if requested.
   Project plans are not required if estimated costs are less than $25K.
       3.5.5.1. A project plan will include the following:
12                                                                        AFI63-104 21 JANUARY 2005


            3.5.5.1.1. An estimate of resources required, by fiscal year, to complete certification including
            the cost of each task of certification (such as engineering analysis and ground tests, wind tun-
            nel tests, electromagnetic tests and analysis, flight tests, technical and source data develop-
            ment, and technical order update costs), aircraft hardware or software costs, and number and
            costs of all test stores required, by fiscal year, for safe carriage and separation and ballistics
            accuracy verification.
            3.5.5.1.2. An estimate of time to complete each task.
            3.5.5.1.3. An estimate of when required resources (funding, stores, etc.) are needed to support
            the user’s need date, whether these resources are available or programmed in the period
            required, and the impact of any funding or other resource shortfalls.
            3.5.5.1.4. Total fiscal year funding breakout by Program Element according to Attachment 3.
            3.5.5.1.5. Test stores required by fiscal year broken out by source, e.g., War Reserve Material
            assets, in production and procured with SE funding, and in production and procured through
            other funding like FMS or another service.
            3.5.5.1.6. Cost-schedule-performance tradeoffs for user consideration in refining require-
            ments.
            3.5.5.1.7. Pertinent aircraft and store program data such as OFP and TO input cutoff dates and
            modification or integration costs and schedule.
     3.5.6. AFSOC, AMC, and SAF/IA may submit priority reclama issues to SAF/AQP for resolution.
     3.5.7. HQ ACC/DRP and the requesting MAJCOM must validate the project plan within 30 calendar
     days.
     3.5.8. AFSEO executes a project plan upon MAJCOM acceptance, or 30 calendar days after MAJ-
     COM receipt, unless SAF/AQP directs otherwise.
     3.5.9. AFSEO and the applicable aircraft SPD end the process by:
        3.5.9.1. Distributing TO Manuals and verified OFPs.
        3.5.9.2. Transmitting a certification completion notification (Attachment 6 or Attachment 7)
        after satisfying the SER.
        3.5.9.3. Providing AAC/NW statement of compatibility for nuclear weapons in TO 11N-50-7.

3.6. SE Decertification. There are two decertification actions: temporary and permanent.
     3.6.1. Temporary Decertification. Any MAJCOM and/or Aircraft/Weapons/Missile System Program
     Office can submit munitions/missiles for Temporary Decertification. Contact HQ ACC/DRP for
     required temporary decertification actions.
     3.6.2. Permanent Decertification. This action includes removal of the weapon from active USAF
     inventory. The following procedures apply:
        3.6.2.1. Any MAJCOM and/or Aircraft/Weapons/Missile System Program Office can submit
        munitions/missiles for Permanent Decertification. For missiles, a memo from the Missile SPO,
        identifying non-compliance of Operational, Safety, Suitability, & Effectiveness (OSS&E) in
        accordance with AFPD 63-12 will begin the decertification of a missile from operational use.
AFI63-104 21 JANUARY 2005                                                                               13


       Conventional weapons not used in the Non-Nuclear Consumables Annual Analysis (NCAA)
       model for two or more consecutive years shall make that weapon/munition a candidate for decer-
       tification.
       3.6.2.2. All permanent decertification submissions (including rationale) will be submitted in
       memorandum format to: HQ ACC/DRP, 204 Dodd Blvd., Suite 226, Langley AFB, VA
       23665-2777, or by e-mail to mailto:acc.drp@langley.af.mil (request a courtesy copy to
       mailto:acc.drpt@langley.af.mil).
       3.6.2.3. HQ ACC/DRP will coordinate the proposed permanent decertification request with MAJ-
       COM/DO/XP/LG. Permanent decertification of stores that have been exported to foreign custom-
       ers must be coordinated with SAF/IA.
       3.6.2.4. After HQ ACC/DR completes the coordination process, a permanent decertification
       request will be forwarded to AF/XOR for approval/signature. The AF/XOR signed memorandum
       directing the permanent decertification action will be forwarded to HQ ACC/DR/DO/LG for
       action.
       3.6.2.5. HQ ACC/DRPT will initiate and staff-coordinate a Permanent Decertification SEEK
       EAGLE Request (PDSER) according to AFI 63-104, Attachment 8 format.
       3.6.2.6. AF/XORW will notify HQ AFMC/LGMW to initiate actions to remove the weapon/
       munitions from the active AF inventory. HQ AFMC/LGMW will notify OO-ALC/WM to remove
       the weapon/munitions from current catalogs, Complete Round Code (CRC) dictionary, aircraft
       and maintenance Technical Orders, etc. AF/XORW will consult with SAF/IA prior to removal of
       weapons/munitions that have been exported to foreign customers.

3.7. Capturing SE Data on Test and Evaluation (T&E) Flights. In order to provide data for SE evalu-
ation during T&E flights, all test agencies should use the configurations in the weapon delivery portion of
the OFP as much as practical unless they jeopardize T&E objectives. The Quick Reference List, main-
tained by the AFSEO, provides these configurations.

3.8. Ballistics Accuracy Criteria. When applicable, include ballistics accuracy verification criteria for
each aircraft-store configuration in a SER to guide SE aircraft and store program activities. Develop these
criteria in coordination with the aircraft program office and AFSEO. Incorporate ballistics accuracy
requirements for aircraft under development in the appropriate capabilities document and system specifi-
cation.

3.9. Improving the Process. Submit proposals to: AFSEO Commander, 205 West D Avenue, Suite 348,
Eglin AFB FL 32542-6865.

Terms
Aircraft-store Compatibility Enterprise (ACE)—The ACE includes all organizations that contribute to
successful execution of the SE mission. Its purpose is to tie national capabilities into a seamless process
to complete aircraft-stores certification. The ACE develops and delivers warfighting capability through a
collaborative spirit and reduces parochial focus among participants. It minimizes duplication of effort and
maximizes the pay-off of capital investments made by the enterprise members.
Aircraft Systems Program Director (SPD)/Program Manager (PM)—The single face to the customer
for a system or product group. The PM directs one or more programs and is accountable to the Program
Executive Officer (PEO). The PM is vested with full authority, responsibility, and resources to execute a
program on behalf of the Air Force. The PM is also responsible for Operational Safety, Suitability and
Effectiveness (OSS&E) of the weapon system as directed by AFI 63-1201.
Ballistics Accuracy Verification— The determination of the accuracy of the weapon digital data
program used with the trajectory model contained in the aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) and
the ballistics tables/weapons delivery technical order, through testing and analysis. Verification confirms
the capability of the aircraft and store combination to meet user accuracy and bias requirements. The
aircraft weapons delivery OFP and updated TO ballistics are fielded after verification testing.
Additionally, a ballistics accuracy verification report compares weapon delivery results with user
accuracy criteria.
Certification data package (CDP)—A CDP for a store is the primary data package used to ensure stores
are physically, mechanically, electromagnetically, environmentally, structurally, and aerodynamically
compatible with Air Force aircraft systems. It also ensures that the required data is present to produce the
necessary TOs. The CDP is composed of the Engineering Data Package, Weapon Source Data Package,
and Standard Source Data Package (Attachment 5).
Compatibility of aircraft and stores—The ability of an aircraft to carry and release the store and related
suspension equipment without unacceptable effects upon the aerodynamic, electromagnetic (excluding
high-altitude electromagnetic pulse), structural, or functional characteristics of either the aircraft or store
under expected flight and ground conditions. MIL-HDBK 244A, Guide to Aircraft Stores Compatibility,
contains basic guidelines for evaluating aircraft-store compatibility and specifies an acceptable separation
must meet pertinent weapon operational criteria. MIL-HDBK-1763, Aircraft-Stores Certification
Procedures, establishes DOD (Department of Defense) standardized procedures for the certification (safe
carriage and safe/acceptable separation) of stores on aircraft.
Compatibility certification (for Nuclear Certified Weapon Systems)— Compatibility Certification is
the process of certifying that the equipment item or weapon system meets design and evaluation
requirements for the mechanical, electrical, and aerodynamic interface between the delivery vehicle or
equipment item and the nuclear weapon.
Flight clearance—A formal flight authorization for a specific limited test or operational purpose such as
Operational Test and Evaluation or a specific operational requirement. The AFSEO issues the FC after
testing and analysis has been made on an aircraft-store configuration to ensure the configuration does not
pose an unacceptable risk. The flight clearance identifies, as appropriate, the aircraft loading
AFI63-104 21 JANUARY 2005                                                                                   19


configuration, carriage, jettison and employment limitations, information needed to make drag and
stability computations, cartridge and orifice combinations or settings, reference to loading procedures and
delivery information, store mass and physical properties, and any other information that affects personnel
or flight safety or mission accomplishment. Recommended Flight Clearances (RFC) for operational units
will be sent to the appropriate aircraft SPD.
Limited certification—Provided at the request of the using command to have a capability in the field
while a routine certification and ballistics accuracy verification tasks are being accomplished. May
consist of a limited employment envelope (not flight tested), unverified Operational Flight Program, or
manual ballistics only. Publication of technical data is required, for example, message flight clearance,
operational supplements, and preliminary technical orders.
Nuclear certification—Occurs when a determination is made by the applicable Service that procedures,
personnel, equipment, facilities, and organizations are capable of performing assigned nuclear weapon
functions and missions. Nuclear certification is part of Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness
(OSS&E), as directed by AFI 63-1201, Assurance of OSS&E. The Air Force Nuclear Certification
Program has two major components: Design Certification and Operational Certification. Refer to AFI
63-125 for details.
Project plan—The Project Plan contains the resource and time estimate for the SER. Project Plans are
not required for projects that have an estimated cost less than $25K. Project Plans (Attachment 9)
Quick-reaction certification (QRC)—Requires the completion of all activities required to certify the
requested aircraft-store configuration. This is an accelerated certification and includes ballistics accuracy
verification, if required. When an urgent operational need date for combat capability exists and the normal
SE certification process will not meet the need, a QRC should be submitted.
Routine certification—Requires the completion of all activities required to certify the aircraft-store
configurations requested in the SER. These activities include planning; analysis; tests; documentation;
development; publication and fielding of pertinent technical manuals applicable to loading, carriage, and
employment, which include the verified ballistics data in the -34 and -25 technical orders; and the
incorporation of the appropriate software changes, resulting from ballistics accuracy verification of the
OFP.
SEEK EAGLE (SE)—The Air Force certification process for determining safe carriage, employment
and jettison limits, safe escape, and ballistics accuracy, when applicable, for all stores in specified loading
configurations on Air Force and FMS aircraft. The SE certification process includes compatibility
analyses for fit, function, electromagnetic compatibility, electromagnetic interference, flutter, loads,
stability and control, and separation; stores loading procedures; ground and wind tunnel tests; and flight
tests. The SE certification process does not include Certification/Accreditation or Information Assurance
verification/validation of stores that connect to classified or unclassified aircraft data buses. The end
product is source data for flight, delivery, and loading manuals, and the weapon ballistics portion of the
aircraft OFP.
SEEK EAGLE Management Support System (SEMSS)—A computer-based system to assist the
entire SE community in planning, coordinating, executing, controlling, and reporting on the SE program.
SEEK EAGLE Request (SER)—A request for certification of aircraft-store configurations, flight
clearances, technical orders, or other SE data (Attachment 4 or Attachment 8).
Stores—Any device intended for internal or external carriage, mounted on aircraft suspension and release
20                                                                    AFI63-104 21 JANUARY 2005


equipment, which may or may not intend to be separated in flight from the aircraft. Stores include
missiles, rockets, bombs, nuclear weapons, mines, fuel and spray tanks, torpedoes, detachable fuel and
spray tanks, dispensers, pods, targets, chaff and flares, decoys, and suspension equipment. In this
instruction, guns mounted internally to the structure of an aircraft are not considered stores for SE
purposes, but chaff, flare, and towed decoy dispensers are considered aircraft suspension and release
equipment whether mounted internally or externally. A SE store for annual stores forecasting purposes is
any store as described above that is used for dedicated SE testing.
User need date—The date HQ ACC or SAF/IA requires all SE certification activities to be completed, to
include the delivery of all technical orders to support implementation, together with OFP ballistics
updates. The user need date will normally be six months before IOC for developmental or major modified
aircraft and stores to permit lead-time for training and evaluation before implementation. For inventory
stores and aircraft, the user need date is a balance between operational and threat requirement and the
practical capability to meet that requirement.

                             CERTIFICATION DATA PACKAGE (CDP)

A5.1. About CDP. The data listed in this attachment ensures that both munition and non-munition type
stores developed, procured from others, or modified are physically, mechanically, electromagnetically,
environmentally, structurally, and aerodynamically compatible with United States Air Force aircraft sys-
tems. The CDP is a collection of data used to generate flight clearances and support the publication of air-
craft TOs. The program office, with management responsibility for the weapon, obtains and maintains a
current CDP. Store Program Offices will provide all current CDP data to the AFSEO designated agency
upon request.

A5.2. The CDP. The CDP consists of an Engineering Data Package (EDP), a Weapon Source Data pack-
age (WSDP), and a Standard Source Data Package (SSDP).
   A5.2.1. The EDP. The EDP is used to determine if a flight clearance or certification can be granted,
   if it is applicable to both munition and non-munition type stores. In addition, the EDP is used to obtain
   the specific engineering data, test data, and computer simulation programs needed to provide inputs to
   the WSDP. An EDP is composed of the following:
       A5.2.1.1. Physical Description. Drawings and documentation (CAD model) to establish external
       dimensions and location of pertinent parts, such as, attaching hardware, fluid or electrical connec-
       tions, fuze installations, arming wire guides, and access covers.

       moments of inertia; and variations of these figures due to manufacturing processes, fuzing
       options, or hysteresis (slosh). Each parameter requires specific tolerances. Provide information on
       AFMC Form 4694, Store Technical and Mass Property Sheet.
       A5.2.1.3. Functional Description. Includes operational description and sequence, safing and
       arming actions, control surface actuation or deployment, motor performance, submunition
       employment, autopilot activation, guidance and control activation, and anticipated actions by the
       launch aircraft before and after store separation. Provides systems mathematical models when
       their existence relates to aircraft compatibility.
       A5.2.1.4. Interface Control Drawings (ICD). Includes electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneu-
       matic, or fuel interface, schematics, connector descriptions and locations, pin functions, electrical
       loads, and arming wire or lanyard routing. The EDP uses either aperture card or magnetic media
       (tapes, discs, etc.) format.
       A5.2.1.5. Aerodynamic Data. Includes freestream, near aircraft, and installed aerodynamic
       force and moment coefficients; and drag counts of store, suspension equipment, and combinations
       of aircraft, suspension equipment, and store. Includes parameters and assumptions used in their
       generation. If applicable, aerodynamic control surface force and moment data, control system
       laws/model, and thrust/mass flow time histories will be included if functional within 5 seconds of
       release.

        or functional sense.
        A5.2.1.9. System Safety Data. Detailed assessment/analysis of the safety and operations risks
        associated with each store. Document risk decisions made, design changes incorporated to reduce
        or eliminate hazards and any residual risks and hazards left in the system. Residual hazards and
        risk accepted and signed off by the appropriate authorities should be thoroughly documented and
        periodically reviewed by the using and developing Commands. Refer to AFI 63-1201, AFI 91-102
        and MIL-STD-882.
     A5.2.2. The Weapon Source Data Package (WSDP) is the primary resource used to develop ballis-
     tics and safe escape data for non-nuclear, munition type stores. The -34 TO uses the WSDP as the
     source data. WSDP content is described in MIL-PRF-38384. The WSDP can be a complex, expensive
     data package and requires a considerable amount of analysis and testing (both ground and flight). A

     sight-depression-angle charts, airspeed and altimeter position error charts (if applicable), dive
     recovery charts, conversion tables, and tables necessary for planning all types of releases.
  A5.2.3. The SSDP. The SSDP for non-nuclear munition type stores is the primary resource used to
  develop loading procedures. The -33 TO uses the SSDP as source data. The SSDP process is governed
  by TO 00-5-3 and MIL-PRF-9977. It contains a description of the munition and how it functions and
  provides step-by-step instructions for munition preparation and loading. MIL-PRF-9977 specifies
  SSDP contents. An SSDP is composed of the following:
     A5.2.3.1. Munitions Description Data. Describes and illustrates items, systems, or components
