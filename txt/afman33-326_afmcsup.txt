                          COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

1.1. Formats Unique to Headquarters Air Force (HAF). HAF formats differ from some of
the other types of correspondence prescribed in this manual. These formats are unique to the
HAF and are used for correspondence submitted to the HAF, Office of the Secretary of Defense
(OSD) and the President of the United States, located in the Washington DC area. Prepare all
correspondence submitted for the Secretary , Under Secretary, Chief, Vice Chief and Assistant
Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force action using the formats/process prescribed in Headquarters
United States Air Force (HQ USAF) Operating Instruction (HOI) 33-3, Correspondence
Preparation, Control and Tracking.
1.2. Plain Language. Prepare all Air Force correspondence using plain language. Plain
language saves the Air Force time, effort, and money. Plain language means using logical
organization and common, everyday words, except for necessary technical terms. Prepare
correspondence using the active voice and short sentences.
   1.2.1. Organize your material to help the reader. Identify your audience for the document;
   write to get their attention and anticipate their questions. Consider any additional readers.
   Always start by putting your main message up front. Present information in the succeeding
   paragraphs in a logical order.
   1.2.2. Avoid words and phrases that your readers might not understand. Define each
   abbreviation or acronym the first time you use it. Use the same term consistently to identify
   a specific thought or object. Use words in a way that does not conflict with ordinary or
   accepted usage. Avoid ambiguous phrasing, confusing legal terms, and technical jargon that
   can mislead your reader.
   1.2.3. Use “you” and other pronouns to speak directly to readers (active voice). Do not refer
   to people as if they were inanimate objects. Address the reader as “you.” “You” reinforces
   the message intended for your reader. Use “we” in place of your organization’s name. Be
   careful using “you” if it sounds accusatory or insulting. Instead, put the emphasis on the
   organization by using “we.”
   1.2.4. Active voice is the best way to identify who is responsible for what action. To
   communicate effectively, write the strong majority (around 75%) of your sentences in the
   active voice.
   1.2.5. Short sentences deliver a clear message. Your sentences should average 15 to 20
   words--never make them longer than 40 words. Complex sentences loaded with dependent
   clauses and exceptions confuse the reader by losing the main point in a forest of words.
   Resist the temptation to put everything in one sentence. Break up your idea into its logical
   parts and make each one the subject of its own sentence. Cut out words that are not really
   necessary.
   1.2.6. Check http://www.plainlanguage.gov, for more plain language techniques.
1.3. Writers’ Responsibilities.
   1.3.1. Use this manual when preparing correspondence.

    1.3.1. (AFMC) Use the references, instructions, and templates on the Action Officer (AO)
    Resources                                      website                                at
    https://cs.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/csops/Lists/Action%20Officer/By%20Topic.aspx and AF
    Handbook (AFH) 33-337, The Tongue and Quill, as needed, when staffing Top 3 task
    packages within HQ AFMC. HQ AFMC’s tasking/tracking tool is called the Senior Officer
    Communication and Coordination Electronic Resource (SOCCER).
    1.3.2. Protect and mark any classified information in your correspondence according to
    Department of Defense (DoD_5200.1-R, Information Security Program, and Air Force
    Instruction (AFI) 31-401, Information Security Program Management. Distribute on a need-
    to-know basis. You may also use the following references:
    1.3.2. (AFMC) Special Handling and Process Requirements for Classified
    Information. All Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) packages must follow guidance
    contained in Department of Defense Manual (DoDM) 5200.01, Volume 1, DoD Information
    Security Program: Overview, Classification, and Declassification, and AFI 31-401,
    Information Security Program Management. Hand carry and package IAW DoDM 5200.01,
    Volume 3, DoD Information Security Program: Protection of Classified Information, and
    mark IAW DoD Manual 5200.01, Volume 2, DoD Information Security Program: Marking
    of Classified Information.
       1.3.2.1. Executive Order 13526, as amended. http://www.archives.gov
       1.3.2.2. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Special Security Center (SSC)

       US Air Force follows CAPCO marking guidance)
       1.3.2.3. ECI 5201.02, 1 Aug 2008
       1.3.2.4. (Added-AFMC) When a staff package is coordinated via SIPR, notification to
       respective OPR (and/or) Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR) will be emailed via
       Non-secure Internet Protocol Router (NIPR) with specific instructions to check SIPR.
       The individual loading information into SOCCER must ensure only unclassified
       information (i.e., unclassified title or subject) is entered into SOCCER.
       1.3.2.5. (Added-AFMC) Collateral. A collateral (confidential or secret) package will
       be made into a hard copy package, hand carried, and kept at the HQ AFMC Knowledge
       Operations Office (HQ AFMC/CCK) for tracking and accountability. Associated
       electronic files are transmitted by SIPR to AFMC/DS Workflow (SIPR email:
       afmc.ds.workflow@afmc.af.smil.mil
       1.3.2.6. (Added-AFMC) Special Access Program (SAP)/Sensitive Compartmented
       Information (SCI)/Top Secret (TS). SAP, SCI, and TS are exempt from processing
       through the HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office due to security requirements. These
       packages are staffed or coordinated through appropriate offices as required on a “need-to-
       know” basis.
    1.3.3. Follow AFI 31-401 if you include “For Official Use Only” information, and refer to
    AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, if the Privacy Act applies.

  1.3.4. Check Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and
  Associated Terms, and Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 1-2, Air Force Glossary, for
  correct terms and usage.
  1.3.5. Distribute correspondence on a need-to-know basis.
  1.3.6. Conserve paper. Use backs of scrap paper for drafts and interoffice memos. Consider
  if you can communicate with other means such as a telephone call or electronic mail (E-
  mail). Do not print and mail out correspondence originally sent by E-mail, unless requested.
  Satisfy the minimum distribution requirements only. Utilize two-sided printing whenever
  possible.
     1.3.6.1. (Added-AFMC) The HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office will require AOs to
     submit a package in hard copy format only when it contains documents requiring wet
     signature (memorandum, award, legal paperwork, etc.). AOs will print a package more
     than 20 pages in length, following the approved format and coordination process
     prescribed on the AO Resources website. The HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office will print
     packages 20 pages or less.
  1.3.7. Use the telephone for routine matters. (You can record the inputs on your record copy
  of the final correspondence.)
  1.3.8. Call, use AF Form 74, Communication Status Notice/Request, or E-mail instead of a
  formal memorandum to check the status of an action (see paragraph 8.1.).
  1.3.9. Use caution when highlighting material you copy or microfilm, since highlighters can
  obscure the print.
  1.3.10. Select the appropriate distribution method. Some distribution methods include: E-
  mail, facsimile (FAX), Defense Message System (DMS), United States Postal Service
  (USPS), Base Information Transfer System (BITS), and Defense Courier Service. Consider
  the needs of the recipient when choosing the distribution method. Send computer-generated
  information electronically if the receiver will copy the information into another computer
  system.
  1.3.11. Use E-mail before using FAX, BITS, or USPS. However, do not send classified E-
  mail on a system not authorized for that purpose. When transmitting classified E-mail take
  care to transmit only that level of classified information for which the system is certified and
  accredited. When transmitting sensitive unclassified information by E-mail, apply an
  appropriate level of safeguards to ensure the sensitive, but unclassified, information is
  properly protected. For more information refer to AFI 33-119, Air Force Messaging. When
  delegating an E-mail task, send a courtesy copy (cc) to the originator.
  1.3.12. Follow AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports Management
  Program: Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections,
  when licensing internal information reports and collections and/or requesting information
  from the public as required by Public Law (PL) 104-13, The Paperwork Reduction Act of
  1995.
  1.3.13. Avoid abbreviations and military jargon. Write out abbreviations the first time used
  and follow with the abbreviation in parenthesis.

     1.3.14. (Added-AFMC) All AOs will attend the AO Focus training, provided by the HQ
     AFMC/DS Workflow Office, within the first three (3) months of being assigned to HQ
     AFMC. Upon arriving, new personnel will be prompted, via the HQ in-processing checklist,
     to sign up for the training. The training covers the tasking process, staffing products and
     guidance, required templates, and SOCCER.
1.4. Suspense Actions.
1.4. (AFMC) The Command’s standard for task processing is 100 percent on time. Quality
staff work should not be sacrificed for timeliness. The goal is to provide leadership, both
internal and external to HQ AFMC, with the best information to make sound decisions in a
responsive manner.
     1.4.1. Set realistic time limits for answering priority and routine correspondence. Establish a
     suspense (due date) only when you need a reply by a specific date. Notify the action agency
     of the suspense date as early as possible.
     1.4.1. (AFMC) The HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office has a suggested suspense timeline
     matrix found on the AO Resources website. The general rule of thumb is three (3) business
     days per management level, (e.g., three (3) business days for the DS/Command Office, three
     (3) business days for the HQ Directorates (2-Ltrs) and three (3) days for Center
     coordination). Give the level accomplishing the actual work as much time as possible. If an
     external customer submits a task to HQ AFMC with a suspense date allowing less time than
     prescribed in the HAF and MAJCOM “Tasking” ROEs found on the AO Resources website,
     the HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office will immediately request an extension from the external
     customer in order to secure enough time to meet due dates.
        1.4.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Staff packages are due to the HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office
        no later than 1700, Eastern Time (ET) Zone, on the OPR due date. Any staff package
        received after 1700 (ET) will be processed as if received on the next duty day.
     1.4.2. Control suspenses at all offices tasked with answering correspondence. Notify the
     originating agency before the due date if the reply is delayed.
        1.4.2.1. (Added-AFMC) “Hot” Packages. A “hot” package requires the senior leaders
        to drop whatever they are doing to review a package because the issue will affect the
        immediate safety and security of personnel. It may also be something needed for
        ongoing contingencies or war efforts, or the AFMC/CC/CV/CA has asked for an
        immediate response on a task. Justification for a “hot” package should be provided in the
        purpose of the electronic Staff Summary Sheet (eSSS) explaining why the package has to
        be completed by a specific date. In contrast, not meeting a standard task due date does
        not constitute a “hot” package.
        1.4.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Urgent Packages. An urgent package requires a response
        within 72 hours. Justification for an urgent package should be provided on the eSSS. In
        contrast, not meeting a standard task due date does not constitute an urgent package.
        1.4.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Congressional Tasks. The HQ AFMC Legislative Liaison
        Office (HQ AFMC/CCX-LL) manages Congressional responses. These tasks will be
        coordinated through and sent back to the external customer by the HQ AFMC/CCX-LL
        Office. The Secretary of Defense expects all Services to respond to Congressional
AFMAN33-326_AFMCSUP_I 25 APRIL 2014                                                         9


     inquiries in a direct and timely manner. Senior leader involvement is needed to ensure
     accurate, concise, and timely responses to Congress. Congressional inquiries must be
     treated as high priority and will be monitored closely during the coordination and
     approval process in order to meet the external customer’s due date. For additional
     guidance, use AFI 90-401 AFMC Supplement, Air Force Relations with Congress.
  1.4.3. You may use an automated system or AF Form 388, Communication Control Record
  (see paragraph 8.2.), to control suspense actions.
  1.4.4. (Added-AFMC) Standard Suspense Tasking Process. Suspense tracking will be
  managed by the HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office. All HQ 2-Ltrs will follow the HQ tasking
  process established by the HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office. Additional information,
  training, and standardized templates can be found on the AO Resources website.
     1.4.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Initiating a Task. The Command standard is to task all
     suspenses through the HQ organizational workflow email accounts and through the
     SOCCER system. The assigned OPR (any of the HQ 2-Ltrs) will task other
     organizations as OCRs using their respective official organizational workflow accounts.
     The AOs are authorized to courtesy copy organizational and AO email accounts at lower
     levels if known. For example: If the AO routinely works with a specific Center on an
     issue or topic, this allows them to provide a preemptive heads-up directly to that office
     while keeping the suspense tracking offices updated at the same time.
     1.4.4.2. (Added-AFMC) All HQ 2-Ltrs and AFMC Centers will establish and monitor
     standardized electronic mailboxes down to the division/squadron (for NIPR and SIPR).
     The following tables are the existing standardized organizational electronic mailboxes on
     the NIPR and SIPR Global Address List (GAL) used by the HQ AFMC/DS Workflow
     Office.

      1.4.4.3. (Added-AFMC) Changing External Suspense Dates. If circumstances
      prevent completing the task on time, request an extension before the task becomes due to
      the HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office or the Command Office. All HQ 2-Ltrs must be
      proactive and engage early on with the external customer for an extension or adjustment.
      The OPR is responsible to work the extension directly with the customer. If/when an
      extension is granted, the OPR must complete the Extension Request Template found on
      the AO Resources website, attach the concurrence correspondence/email from the
      external customer, and email to AFMC/DS Workflow. Extension requests for tasks with
      an external customer will not be granted without prior approval from the external
      customer.
      1.4.4.4. (Added-AFMC) Changing Internal Suspense Dates. OPRs will work
      extensions with internal customers (i.e., AFMC/CC/CV/CA) directly with the HQ
      AFMC/DS Workflow Office on a case-by-case basis.
      1.4.4.5. (Added-AFMC) Responses Requiring Rework. The HQ AFMC/DS
      Workflow Office will return packages requiring rework (also called “kickbacks,” or KBs)
      with instructions or request for information needed for the OPR to satisfy the
      requirements of the task prior to re-submission.
      1.4.4.6. (Added-AFMC) Closing a Task. Once the OPR “Action to Close” has been
      completed, the task can, in most cases, be closed in SOCCER. After receiving
      confirmation of task completion (i.e., verification from the Command Office or sent to
      external customer email), the HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office will close Command
      Office tasks.
          1.4.4.6.1. (Added-AFMC) Closing a Task with External Customers. For Top 3
          external tasks loaded by the HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office, the SOCCER will not
          be closed until the HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office receives verification that the
          external customer has been contacted (applies to both NIPR and SIPR packages).
          The easiest way to accomplish this is to courtesy copy HQ AFMC/DS Workflow on
          the email that the OPR sends to the external customer notifying them of
          AFMC/CC/CV/CA approval of, coordination of, or signature on the requisite
          document(s).
          1.4.4.6.2. (Added-AFMC) All respective HQ 2-Ltr and Center Workflows are
          highly encouraged to search pending tasks on a regular basis to clear tasks not
          properly closed out in SOCCER. If a pending task cannot be closed out at the HQ 2-
          Ltr or Center level due to permission limitations, request assistance from the HQ
          AFMC/DS Workflow Office.
1.5. Coordination Process.
   1.5.1. Coordinate with offices affected by the proposed action during the draft stage to keep
   from revising the final version.
   1.5.2. Coordinate by telephone or E-mail when possible. Do not indicate coordination in the
   upper right-hand corner since it is used for the file code (see AFMAN 33-363).
   1.5.2. (AFMC) Every effort should be made to electronically staff and coordinate all
   correspondence within HQ AFMC.
 12                                           AFMAN33-326_AFMCSUP_I 25 APRIL 2014


   1.5.3. You may coordinate using AF Form1768, Staff Summary Sheet (see paragraph 3.4).
   1.5.4. Remember to coordinate with each office that has a functional interest. Consider the
   chain of command to ensure complete coordination. Schedule enough time to finish review
   and coordination.
      1.5.4.1. (Added-AFMC) The HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office will use HAF’s “Parallel
      and Down” ROEs when staffing tasks. The HQ 2-Ltrs are authorized to create responses,
      or task other organizations, as long as the tasked organizations are on an equivalent level
      or one level down.
      1.5.4.2. (Added-AFMC) When a task is determined as a HQ 2-Ltr task, the HQ
      AFMC/DS Workflow Office will send the task to the appropriate HQ 2-Ltr Workflow for
      action. The HQ 2-Ltr is responsible to staff/complete the task and submit response to the
      customer.
      1.5.4.3. (Added-AFMC) Center Sponsorship. The following primary partnerships
      have been established for HQ 2-Ltr ownership and HQ accountability when a Center is
      required to respond to a task and a HQ 2-Ltr cannot be clearly identified as OPR to a
      task.

      Air Force Test Center (AFTC)                                  HQ AFMC/A3

   1.5.5. (Added-AFMC) Records Management. When a task is complete, the eSSS and any
   associated signed documents will be scanned by the HQ AFMC/CCK Office for the official
   electronic record. SIPR tasks are exempt from scanning. The completed hard copy package
   will be returned to the HQ 2-Ltr OPR.

                           STATIONERY STANDARDS AND USES

2.1. Paper Standards. Use 8 1/2-inch by 11-inch paper.
   2.1.1. Original. Use white letterhead stationery (printed or computer-generated) for the first
   page of a memorandum, staff study, report, or minutes of a meeting. Use plain white paper
   for continuation pages. (See paragraph 2.4 for computer-generated letterhead.)
   2.1.2. Copies. Use plain white paper for information or courtesy copies.
   2.1.3. Paper Quality. Stationery is produced from recycled paper that has at least 25 percent
   cotton or rag content. The recycled logo is shown in the watermark. Paper quality must not
   exceed the following:

Table 2.1. Paper Quality.
                    Item              Paper Color       Grade        Pounds
                    Letterhead        White             50% rag      16
                                                        or
                                                        25% rag      20


                    Continuation      White             50% rag      16
                                                        or
                                                        25% rag      20

2.2. Standard Letterhead. DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5330.2, Specifications for DoD
Letterheads, establishes the standards for letterheads. There are only two types of letterhead
authorized for use: standard (pre-printed) and computer-generated. Chief master sergeants
(CMSgt) and command chief master sergeants use standard letterhead/stationery. They must use
personal stationary if the CMSgt insignia or symbols are used. Submit any exceptions to the
specified standards through your MAJCOM to SAF/CIO A6 for final determination. ANG
exceptions are approved by individual ANG State Headquarters or the Director, Air National
Guard.
2.3. Pre-printed Letterhead. See Figure 2.1 for an example of letterhead. MAJCOMs may
elect to use generic two-line command letterhead for command-wide use. MAJCOMs may
authorize letterhead below wing-level if the quantity needed justifies the printing cost or other
circumstances warrant. Any unit without its own letterhead uses its parent unit’s letterhead
stationery and identifies its organization and standard office symbol in the FROM caption.
   2.3.1. Ink. Print the letterhead and seal using either reflex blue or black ink.
   2.3.2. Seal. The DoD seal is one inch in diameter. Align the seal 1/2-inch from the upper
   left and top edge of the paper. Do not use any other emblem, decorative device, or
   distinguishing insignia with or in place of the DoD seal.
   2.3.3. Format. Center organization name and address on the letterhead using no more than
   four lines:
 14                                            AFMAN33-326_AFMCSUP_I 25 APRIL 2014


       2.3.3.1. First Line. DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. Center this line leaving 5/8-
       inch from the top of the sheet. Print it in 12 point uppercase using copperplate letters,
       heavy plate Gothic letters, or equivalent.
       2.3.3.2. Second Line. Center the name of the organization as shown in the G-series
       special order that established it. If G-series orders do not exist, the MAJCOM Director of
       Communications decides the second line.               Put HEADQUARTERS before the
       organization’s name only if it appears in the activation order. Print it in 10.5 point
       uppercase using copperplate letters, heavy plate Gothic letters, or equivalent. If the name
       is more than fifty characters, you may use an additional line.
       2.3.3.3. Third Line. If used, center the location without the ZIP+4 code on this line.
       Print it in 10.5 point uppercase using copperplate letters, heavy plate Gothic letters, or
       equivalent. The bottom of the third line should be 1 1/16 inches from the top of the sheet.
       If your unit is overseas, do not show the Army and Air Force Post Office (APO) or Fleet
       Post Office (FPO) number and a geographical location together. You may use the two-
       letter state abbreviation or spell out the state name. Do not use punctuation in the last
       line of the address element.
EXAMPLES:
                      DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
            HEADQUARTERS AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND


                           DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
                      AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND


                      DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
            HEADQUARTERS AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND
                     RANDOLPH AIR FORCE BASE TEXAS
   2.3.4. Optional Items. Fold marks are guides for judging typing space and for folding the
   paper in three equal parts. Typist guidelines show you are near the 1-inch bottom margin. If
   used, print them in half-point rules (see Figure 2.1).
2.4. Computer-Generated Letterhead. Computer-generated letterhead allows for the use of
plain white bond paper and high production rates. It also permits an organization to generate its
own letterhead stationery.
   2.4.1. Use. You may use computer-generated letterhead the same as printed letterhead when
   the design satisfies all specifications in paragraph 2.3. Use computer-generated letterhead
   only for correspondence within the DoD. Do not use for the signature of the Secretary or
   Deputy Secretary of Defense, or Executive Secretary of the DoD. MAJCOMs may direct the
   use of printed letterhead for headquarters and subordinate units.
   2.4.2. Format. When using computer-generated letterhead, you may identify the office name
   as approved in organizational designation documents. Center the office name below the
   organization name. You may identify the complete mailing address including ZIP+4 code.
   Do not use more than four lines for the letterhead.
AFMAN33-326_AFMCSUP_I 25 APRIL 2014                                                            15


2.5. Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF) Letterhead. HQ USAF offices use
this stationery, as do certain field operating agencies (FOA) when their commanders function as
members of HAF.
2.6. Department of Defense (DoD) Programs and Activities Letterhead. When the
Department of the Air Force is the executive agent for DoD-directed programs, the letterhead
format is similar to paragraph 2.3; do not show DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE on the
top line for DoD programs or joint activities. Use this layout instead:
   2.6.1. First line. Print the name of the program as shown in the DoD directive.
   2.6.2. Second and third line. Print the location. For further guidance, contact SAF/A6PP.

                      RANDOLPH AIR FORCE BASE TX 78150-4567
2.7. Slogans. MAJCOMs and FOAs may permit use of slogans on official memorandums and
personalized letters. Slogans will:
   2.7.1. Represent the mission of the organization.
   2.7.2. Be easy to understand.
   2.7.3. Not be offensive.
   2.7.4. Meet printing specifications (printed approximately 1/2-inch from bottom of page).
2.8. Logograms (Logos). Do not use the Department of the Air Force seal on stationery; the
proper use of the Department of the Air Force seal is covered in Attachment 2. DoDI 5330.2
prohibits use of logos, emblems, decorative devices, or distinguishing insignia on stationery.
OSD grants waivers only for programs of Air Force-wide importance and applicability, such as
the Air Force Fiftieth Anniversary. Send waiver requests to SAF/CIO A6 for staffing to OSD
through the Washington Headquarters Services. Use existing logo stationery until all supplies
are exhausted.

  THE OFFICIAL MEMORANDUM, COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT FORMS
           AND OTHER TYPES OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATION

3.1. Official Memorandums. See AFH 33-337 for formatting of official memorandums.
3.2. AF Form 74, Communication Status Notice/Request. Use this form to let senders know
the status of their correspondence. You may document comments on the record copy. You may
use the AF Form 74 remarks section for notification of official Air Force business other than
communications status, as authorized by your MAJCOM. You can use the form as a postcard
between activities serviced either by the military distribution system or the USPS.
3.3. AF Form 388, Communication Control Record. Use the AF Form 388 only when you
require formal suspense controls. Use it when you receive correspondence and need to assign
action within your office or to a lower office, or use it to track correspondence requiring a reply
by a specific date. When you use the AF Form 388:
   3.3.1. File the original or a copy by the suspense date and attach all other copies to the
   correspondence.
   3.3.2. Show any extension of the suspense date on the form and refile accordingly.
3.4. AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet. Use the AF Form 1768 or a similar electronic
version to summarize staff work, to request action, or to forward information. See AFH 33-337
for more information on filling out the AF Form 1768. Follow local guidance for formatting
electronic versions of the AF Form 1768. Coordination is as follows:
   3.4.1. When you agree with the proposed action, sign your surname, rank or grade, and date
   on the bottom line if you are the addressee; sign on the top line if you are not the addressee.
   3.4.2. When you do not agree with the proposed action, write a memorandum or send an
   official e-mail to the action office stating your reasons. For hard copy AF Form 1768
   coordination, write in ink “See Memorandum” in the signature column of the AF Form 1768
   after your office symbol. Attach your memorandum and return it to the action office. This
   can be accomplished through e-mail if coordinating on an electronic AF Form 1768.
   3.4.3. Try to resolve all differences when you receive a non-concurrence on an AF Form
   1768.
       3.4.3.1. If you cannot resolve the differences, the action officer must write a rebuttal
       memorandum to the approval authority which states differences discussed with the
       nonconcurring official and explains why you cannot change the proposed action. Attach
       the rebuttal memorandum and the non-concurrence memorandum as the last tab to the
       original AF Form 1768, and annotate in pen the additional tab under the list of tabs. Send
       it to the next addressee shown on the AF Form 1768. If coordinating through electronic
       means, attach the differences to the package before forwarding to the approval authority.
       3.4.3.2. If you resolve differences and no changes are made to the AF Form 1768 or to
       any attachments, the previously nonconcurring official shows concurrence by marking
       through the statement “See Memorandum” and signing surname, rank or grade, and date.

     The action officer annotates “Differences resolved and no changes needed” on the non-
     concurrence memorandum, initials the statement, and attaches this memorandum to the
     record or coordination copy. Route the AF Form 1768 to the next addressee shown on
     the form. If using an electronic AF Form 1768, the nonconcurring official should update
     the electronic staff summary sheet appropriately.
     3.4.3.3. If you resolve your differences and changes are made to the AF Form 1768 or to
     any attachments, the action officer must prepare a new AF Form 1768 and coordinate it
     as a new package with all offices.

                                            Chapter 4

                          GUIDE AND FORM MEMORANDUMS

4.1. Guide Memorandums. These are models of a memorandum text composed in advance,
but not printed. They may be complete memorandums with several paragraphs or a single
paragraph. Use guide memorandums to compose official memorandums. Select the
combination of paragraphs appropriate for the reply.
4.2. Form Memorandums. These are mass-produced memos sent in place of individually
composed or typed memorandums when many individuals require similar information or the
same individual requires the information at frequent intervals. These also include standard
formats stored on electronic media that can be accessed, completed with optional data, and then
printed or electronically forwarded.
   4.2.1. Types of Form Memorandums. The three basic formats for form memorandums are
   prewritten, fill-in, and optional statement. Prewritten form memorandums omit the receiver’s
   name, address, and date. Fill-in form memorandums omit any information that varies with
   each response. Optional statement form memorandums provide several options; the writer
   checks the statements that apply to the specific situation. A form memorandum may have
   space for filling in information, selecting one of several statements, or both.
   4.2.2. Form Memorandums Use. Use form memorandums when the subject matter and the
   action are routine or informational, when it is more economical to duplicate the
   memorandum than to type each memorandum individually, and when the printed format
   expedites response from the recipient. Do not use form memorandums if the subject is of a
   personal or congratulatory nature, if it may bring grief, disappointment, or embarrassment to
   the recipient, or if a numbered form would be better.
   4.2.3. Preparing and Controlling Form Memorandums:
         4.2.3.1. Justification. Analyze your correspondence for a 2-week period and group
         memorandums that are similar in meaning and purpose. Count the number of
         individually typed memorandums for each group. A form memorandum is justified if:

Table 4.1. Form Memorandum (Justified).
    The line count (text) of a repetitive        And the number of similar
    memorandum is:                               memorandums written each month is:


    5                                            30 or more
    10                                           15 or more
    15                                           10 or more
Note: Your knowledge operations manager can advise if a numbered form would be more
beneficial.

      4.2.3.2. Composition. Follow the principles of writing in AFH 33-337. Consider the
      memorandum’s impact, especially if it is sent outside the Air Force. If a memorandum
      collects information, review the requirements of the PL 104-13 and AFI 33-324.
      4.2.3.3. Design. Leave enough blank space to complete a fill-in form memorandum.
      Align check boxes () on an optional statement form memorandum.
      4.2.3.4. Signature. Sign form memorandums individually or sign the master before
      reproduction.
      4.2.3.5. Control. Identify each form or guide memorandum by a different symbol if you
      have more than one, e.g. FM-1, FM-2; GM-1, GM-2, etc. You may mark the
      memorandums themselves or their folders. Review the need and currency of the
      memorandum before reproduction, and reproduce no more than a 3-month supply. Not to
      be confused with guidance memorandums/numbering per AFI 33-360 Table 2.1.
4.3. Other Written Communication Types. For other written communications, see AFH 33-
337.

                                           Chapter 5

                                    USE OF ENVELOPES

5.1. General Information. Use standard addresses listed in USPS Publication 28, Postal
Addressing Standards.
5.2. Envelope Size.
   5.2.1. Use a rectangular envelope only slightly larger than the correspondence. Envelopes
   should be no smaller than 3.5 by 5 inches and no larger than 6.125 by 11.5 inches.
   5.2.2. You may use window envelopes. Be sure to adjust the MEMORANDUM FOR
   element to align the address with the envelope window.
   5.2.3. For consolidated mailing, the largest item that cannot be folded determines the
   envelope size (see DoDI 4525.8 /AFSUP).
5.3. Addressing the Envelope. For successful processing by optical character recognition
(OCR) equipment, the USPS requires addresses to be machine-printed, with a uniform left
margin, and formatted in a manner that allows an OCR to recognize the information. Hand
written addresses are acceptable when no other means are available.
   5.3.1. Printing. Use a typewriter or print addresses on a laser printer. You may not hand
   write or use rubber stamps unless laser printers and appropriate software are not available.
   5.3.2. Typeface. Use Courier New font 12 or similar simple sans serif. Be sure characters
   are not too close together and do not touch or overlap. Do not use bold, italic, script, or other
   unusual typefaces.
   5.3.3. Margins. Leave margins at least 0.5-inch from the left and right edges of the envelope
   and at least 0.625-inch from the bottom of the envelope. The last line of the address should
   be no lower than 0.625-inch and no higher than 2.75 inches from the bottom of the envelope.
   5.3.4. Address Format. See Figure 5.1 for address position and format. Use block style with
   a uniform left margin, parallel to the long edge of the envelope. Single-space the address
   block and type the entire addresses in uppercase. Use one or two spaces between words. Do
   not use punctuation in the last two lines of the address block except for the dash in the ZIP+4
   code. Addresses are limited to five lines:
      5.3.4.1. Optional Address Data Line. Use this line for any nonaddress data such as
      account numbers, presort codes, or mail stop codes.
      5.3.4.2. Optional Attention Line. Use this line to direct mail to a specific person.
      5.3.4.3. Organization Abbreviation/Office Symbol Line.               Use the organization
      abbreviation and office symbol separated by a virgule.
      5.3.4.4. Delivery Address Line. Use this line for the street or post office box number,
      and the room or suite number. Use authorized USPS abbreviations found in USPS
      Publication 28. Do not use punctuation on this line. Delivery addresses may be hand
      printed (hand printed, no script) only when no automation or other methods of typing are
      available.
 24                                          AFMAN33-326_AFMCSUP_I 25 APRIL 2014


      5.3.4.5. City or Base, State, ZIP+4 Code Line. Use the two-letter state abbreviations
      found in USPS Publication 28. Always include the ZIP+4 code in the address. Do not
      use commas between the city or base, abbreviation, and ZIP+4 code; the dash in the
      ZIP+4 code is the only punctuation used in the last address line. With overseas
      addresses, do not use the APO or FPO number and geographical location together; this
      will cause the mail to enter the international mail channels. Do not type any information
      below or to the right of the city, state, and ZIP+4 code address line.

Figure 5.1. Envelope Address Position and Format.




   5.3.5. Return Address Format. Place the return address in the upper left corner of the
   envelope (see Figure 5.2). Follow the address format (see paragraph 5.3.4). Use the
   complete mailing address. Type “OFFICIAL BUSINESS” beneath the return address (see
   DoDI 4525.8 /AFSUP).

Figure 5.2. Printing Addresses and Return Addresses.
AFMAN33-326_AFMCSUP_I 25 APRIL 2014                                                          25


5.4. Machine-Processed Mailing. Limit the thickness of the envelope to 0.25 inch or less when
sealed (about four sheets of bond paper or eight tissue weight sheets). Press envelope to remove
air. Write “nonmachinable” above the address on the envelope if it is more than 0.25 inch thick
(see DoD 4525.8-M/AFSUP).
5.5. Mailing Labels, Cards, and Self-Mailers. See DoD 4525.8-M/AFSUP.
5.6. Preparation and Content of Mail Indicia. See DoD 4525.8-M/AFSUP.
5.7. Preparing Envelopes for Classified Material. See DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401.

                                 Chapter 6 (Added-AFMC)

                       ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITES (ADDED)

6.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC Key Positions and Responsibilities.
   6.1.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/Director of Staff (DS). HQ AFMC/DS assigns all
   Command tasks requiring AFMC/CC/CV/CA approval/coordination and tasks the
   appropriate HQ 2-Ltr for accountability. HQ AFMC/DS serves as the final authority for
   completeness of all tasks prior to AFMC/CC/CV/CA approval.
   6.1.2. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office. This office manages the flow of
   all packages to the Top 3. They maintain and update the AO Resources website and the HQ
   AFMC AO Guide. The AO Resources website and the AO Guide have detailed information
   regarding the tasking process, staffing products, and established templates.
   6.1.3. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC Directorates. A HQ 2-Ltr serves as the OPR for each
   Top 3 task within the Command. The OPR is responsible for tasking other affected
   organizations as OCR when coordination from a lateral or lower level is required. However,
   the HQ 2-Ltr retains overall ownership until completion.
      6.1.3.1. (Added-AFMC) For tasks going to AFMC/CC/CV/CA, the HQ 2-Ltr
      leadership (Director/Deputy Director) is responsible for the review/quality check,
      approval, and submission of completed packages to the HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office.
      In rare circumstances (e.g., leave, temporary duty (TDY)), an individual other than the
      Director/Deputy Director may sign a package. (This exception will be kept to the
      minimum necessary.)
   6.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Centers. When Center coordination on a task is required and the
   task is for HQ AFMC Top 3 action, the HQ 2-Ltrs must obtain Center Top 3 coordination
   prior to submitting the staff package to the HQ AFMC/DS Workflow Office. In rare
   circumstances, if Center Top 3 is unavailable (e.g., leave and/or TDY), Center DS
   coordination will be accepted in lieu of Center Top 3. (This exception will be kept to the
   minimum necessary.)
   6.1.5. (Added-AFMC) Action Officers. The AO owns the task from cradle-to-grave, needs
   to know the status of the package at all times and ensure their directorate chain of command
   receives task status updates during the life cycle of the task. At the OPR, an AO will be
   assigned to a task. The AO is responsible for adherence to staffing formats and policies.

   Compliance Division (SAF/A6PP) approves the manner in which the seal is used on printed

Matching System [PMS] Reflex Blue) and Air Force yellow (PMS 116) are used prominently on
the Air Force seal (see AFI 84-105, Organizational Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry). The seal is
described as follows:
   A2.2.1. A circular disc of ultramarine blue edged with a narrow Air Force yellow border.
       A2.2.1.1. Centered on the disc, the Air Force coat of arms, consisting of the crest and
       shield.
       A2.2.1.2. The crest is made up of the eagle, wreath, and cloud form. The American bald
       eagle symbolizes the United States and its air power and is depicted in its natural colors.

       The wreath under the eagle is made up of six alternate folds of metal and light blue. This
       repeats the metal and color used in the shield. The white clouds behind the eagle denote
       the start of a new sky.
       A2.2.1.3. The shield, directly below the eagle and wreath, is divided horizontally into
       two parts by a nebular line representing clouds. The top part bears an Air Force yellow
       thunderbolt with flames in natural color that shows striking power through the use of
       aerospace. The thunderbolt consists of an Air Force yellow vertical twist with three
       natural color flames on each end crossing a pair of horizontal wings with eight lightning
       bolts. The background of the top part is light blue representing the sky. The lower part is
       white representing metal silver.
   A2.2.2. The 13 white encircling stars represent the original 13 colonies.
   A2.2.3. The Air Force yellow numerals under the shield are 1947. This is the year the
   Department of the Air Force was established.

   lettering. The inscriptions read “Department of the Air Force” on the top part and “United
   States of America” on the lower part.
