SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This version
establishes ILCM guidance and governance procedures for all AF modification activities.
Additional text has been added to define and/or clarify key terms associated with the AF
modification process. Procedures for developing and processing modification proposals have
been consolidated and included in the main body of this AFI. Authorities, limitations, and
procedures for developing and processing modification proposals have been substantially
changed; temporary modification validation and approval duration has been changed. Additional
requirements for initiating and executing modification programs have been added, many of
which incorporate recommendations contained in recent audit/inspection reports regarding the
AF acquisition and sustainment enterprise processes. References to complementary AFIs have
been updated and/or added throughout. The provisions of this instruction have been extended to
encompass firmware and software modifications, as well as modifications to weapon systems
managed under AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon
Systems. This instruction no longer prescribes AF Form 3525 and refers to AFI 63-1201 for
guidance on managing the configuration of systems, sub systems and items, including the
conduct of configuration control boards and/or related configuration management processes.

(AMC) This supplement provides major rewrite/reorganization and has aligned configuration
review board procedures for all MAF units with AFI 63-131, Modification Program
Management.

                   MODIFICATION MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to implement direction from the Secretary of
the Air Force (SECAF) contained in AFPD 63-1/20-1, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle
Management.       This instruction requires that modifications be managed as efforts using
acquisition and sustainment processes, techniques, and governance as outlined in AFI 63-101,
Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management.
   1.1.1. This instruction provides acquisition and sustainment life cycle management
   instruction for modifications and must be used in conjunction with AFI 63-101. This AFI is
   also used in conjunction with: AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering, AFI 10-601,
   Capabilities Based Requirements Development, AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
   Maintenance Management, AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and AFI 99-
   103, Capabilities Based Test and Evaluation. Modification efforts involving nuclear
   materiel and weapons are also governed by AFI 63-103, Joint Air Force-National Nuclear
   Security Administration (AF-NNSA) Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle Management.
   1.1.2. This instruction identifies the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in
   modification management, the process to develop and staff a modification proposal, and the
   process to execute a modification once it has been approved and funded.
   1.1.3. Unless specified otherwise, for the purposes of this instruction, AF materiel subject to
   the provisions of this AFI will be generically referred to as ―  Systems‖, ―subsystems‖, and
   ―items.‖
   1.1.4. Unless specified otherwise, the term ―
                                               materiel command‖ will refer to the Air Force
   Materiel Command (AFMC), the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), and other equivalent
   organizations throughout the DOD.
   1.1.5. Unless otherwise specified, for the purpose of this document, the term Program
   Manager (PM) will be synonymous with the AFI 63-101 defined System Program Manager
   (SPM).
1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to the management of all modification programs
identified on the Acquisition Program Master List (APML) and Sustainment Program Master
List (SPML), modifications to space programs and designated weapon systems cited in AFPD
10-9, Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems or AFI 10-901,
Lead Operating Command--Communications and Information Systems Management
   1.2.1. Unless otherwise specified, for the purpose of this document, the term program will be
   used to identify any modification program on the APML or SPML, or modification to space
   systems or designated product groups, or other specified system or subsystem activities,
   including Special Access Programs .
       1.2.1.1. The APML documents acquisition activities designated by the MDA as an
       ACAT program that have entered the acquisition framework.
       1.2.1.2. The SPML documents sustainment activities designated by the Commander of
       Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC/CC).

        1.2.1.3. Modifications that are not on the APML or SPML but are identified on a
        Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Program Budget Exhibit (R-1)
        and Procurement Program Budget Exhibits (P-1/P3A) are also governed by the
        provisions of this instruction.
     1.2.2. This instruction applies to form, fit, function, or interface (F3I) modifications of an in-
     service AF hardware or software Configuration Item or a combination of both that satisfies
     an end use function and is designated for separate configuration management. The
     Configuration Item may be part of a weapon system, including telecommunications and
     information systems operated by the Air Force that involve intelligence and crypto logic
     functions related to national security, command and control of military forces, systems, sub
     systems and items that are integral to the operation of AF weapon systems that has been
     designated as ‗mission essential‘ to conduct military or intelligence operations.
     1.2.3. This instruction applies to permanent and temporary modifications that are related to
     both capability and sustainment requirements.
        1.2.3.1. A capability modification is predominantly accomplished in order to satisfy an
        operational mission requirement by adding a new capability or function, enhancing
        technical performance, or operational suitability of the asset. Capability modifications
        may also include efforts designed to improve the operational availability of the item, or to
        reduce its ownership costs. A capability modification usually results in a change to the
        existing functional baseline or item performance specification for that CI.
        1.2.3.2. A sustainment modification is predominantly accomplished to correct product
        quality deficiencies or to preserve/comply with the functional baseline or performance
        specification. A sustainment modification results in a change to the product baseline and
        may also result in a change to the existing functional baseline or item performance
        specification for that CI.
     1.2.4. This instruction does not apply to:
        1.2.4.1. Modifications of commercially available office information systems such as
        network servers and standard desktop computers, or to data processing equipment that is
        used for routine administrative support functions or business applications—except when
        part of a weapon system configuration baseline.
        1.2.4.2. Individual engineering changes completed as part of an existing ACAT program
        involving developmental items or production articles that have not been formally
        accepted by the government via a Department of Defense Form 250 (DD 250) Materiel
        Inspection and Receiving Report.
        1.2.4.3. Assets that are no longer part of an active inventory, such as aircraft in long-term
        storage.
        1.2.4.4. Modifications of facilities or other base-level infrastructure, telecommunications
        equipment, or property.
        1.2.4.5. Maintenance actions.
1.3. Modification. For the purposes of this instruction, a modification is defined as a change to
the form, fit, function, or interface (F3I) of an in-service AF hardware or software Configuration
Item.

                                           Chapter 3

                                  MODIFICATION TYPES

3.1. Modification Types. There are two types of modifications, temporary and permanent.
3.2. Temporary Modifications. Temporary modifications change the configuration of an item
to enable short-term operational mission accomplishment, or to conduct test and evaluation
(T&E) of new and modified equipment. There are two kinds of temporary modifications:
Temporary-1 and Temporary-2.
   3.2.1. Serialized Item Management (SIM) requirements, such as Item Unique Identification
   (IUID) registration and marking, will be considered for Temporary modifications based on
   the requirements in DODI 8320.04, Item Unique Identification (IUID) Standards for
   Tangible Personal Property, DODI 4151.19, Serialized Item Management (SIM) for Materiel
   Maintenance, and the long term strategy of the modification.
   3.2.2. The AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal is used to define and approve temporary
   modification proposals. The requesting activity shall fully describe the modification on AF
   Form 1067 to include: number of units to be modified, total duration of installed temporary
   modification, and description of the user‘s and/or system/commodity manager‘s plan for
   converting the modification into a permanent modification, or their plan for removing the
   modification from effected articles. In instances where the approved modification is not fully
   described on the AF Form 1067, the AF Form 1067 will be returned to the author for
   required updates and resubmission. (Note: This requirement replaces the 5 unit/1 year rule
   and T-1 waiver process from previous AFI 63-1101)
   3.2.3. Temporary-1 (T-1). T-1 modifications change the configuration of an item in order to
   satisfy short-term operational mission requirements by adding, modifying, or removing
   hardware and/or software components or capabilities in a manner that provides an immediate
   operational benefit. T-1 modifications typically involve the use of existing off-the-shelf or
   non-developmental items, including stock-listed equipment and materiel.
       3.2.3.1. T-1 modifications shall not be used to circumvent the requirements associated
       with permanent modifications, as prescribed in this instruction, or the lack of appropriate
       modification funding.
       3.2.3.2. T-1 modifications involving non-space related systems and equipment are
       normally accomplished and supported locally, by a MAJCOM or base-level operational
       unit. T-1 modifications involving space systems and equipment are normally
       accomplished and supported by an AFSPC PM.
       3.2.3.3. The PM shall ensure all modifications address operational safety, suitability, and
       effectiveness.
       3.2.3.4. T-1 modifications shall be approved by the Program Manager. Requests must
       include clear and compelling evidence that shows why the temporary modification is
       needed to support mission requirements. The request shall be coordinated through the
       lead command (as applicable), to the AFPD 10-9 designated weapon system program
       manager (SPM), product group manager (PGM), or designated commodity manager
       (CM) within AFMC (non-space assets) or AFSPC (space assets). T-1 modifications with
18                                            AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010


     duration of greater than 1 year shall be supported by clear and compelling
     justification/rationale to exceed 1 year. All existing T-1s that were submitted under the
     5-asset/1 year rule of the Jul 2001 version of AFI 63-1101, shall submit a revised AF
     Form 1067 in lieu of a waiver.
     3.2.3.5. All approved T-1 modifications with a duration that exceeds 1 year shall be
     forwarded to either SAF/XCI (for designated communications and electronics (C&E)
     systems) or AF/A4L (for non-C&E systems and C&E end-items incorporated into non-
     C&E weapon systems) for information.
     3.2.3.6. T-1 modifications are not authorized permanent logistics support such as
     peculiar support equipment and sustaining engineering support. However, minimum
     essential logistics support, including verified technical data or interim contractor support,
     essential for the temporary operation and sustainment of the modification in its
     designated mission environment will be provided, consistent with weapon system support
     concepts and/or product support strategies. The lead command shall determine these
     minimum essential logistics support requirements in coordination with the PM or
     materiel manager as applicable. Government personnel (military and civilian) shall use
     verified technical data in installing or maintaining a temporary modification.
     3.2.3.7. T-1 modifications may be used to satisfy an urgent operational need (UON) that
     have been validated IAW AFI 10-601, and joint urgent operational needs (JUON) that
     have been validated IAW CJCSI 3470.01, Rapid Validation and Resourcing of Joint
     Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) in the Year of Execution.
     3.2.3.8. Unless otherwise specified in the currently approved AF Form 1067, all T-1
     modifications will be replaced by permanent modifications or removed from the host
     system or component within one year of installation.
     3.2.3.9. Organizations requesting to extend the installation of a T-1 modification beyond
     the currently approved quantity or time period will prepare and submit a new AF Form
     1067 in accordance with this instruction.
     3.2.3.10. T-1 modifications that are converted into permanent modifications require
     development and processing of a new AF Form 1067 or other equivalent modification
     proposal to ensure permanent life cycle management issues such as supportability are
     addressed. In such cases, the lead command will notify the applicable PM of their intent
     to convert a T-1 modification into a permanent modification, and follow the permanent
     modification proposal requirements defined in this instruction.
     3.2.3.11. T-1 modified assets must be capable of being returned to their original or
     current approved permanent configuration within 48 hours or a time period specified by
     the lead command and documented in AF Form 1067.
     3.2.3.12. T-1 modifications will be removed prior to host weapon system/component
     input for Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) unless coordinated with the PDM
     organization.
  3.2.4. Temporary-2 (T-2). T-2 modifications are used to evaluate the technical performance,
  operational effectiveness, and/or the operational suitability of developmental hardware and
  software capabilities when not associated with a permanent modification. T-2 modifications
AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                            19


  are also used to install and operate T&E-specific support equipment, instrumentation and
  data recording equipment, telemetry systems, etc. on T&E assets. T-2 modifications may be
  used in support of all forms of T&E activity, including developmental test and evaluation,
  operational test and evaluation, and MAJCOM-conducted force development evaluation
  activities.
     3.2.4.1. The PM, the lead command, and designated test agencies will collaboratively
     determine the number of assets to be T-2 modified based on the scope, complexity, and
     length of T&E activities. They will collaboratively determine the organizational roles,
     responsibilities, and procedures for the configuration management of T-2 modified test
     assets, the installation, operation, and sustainment of T-2 modification equipment, and
     funding requirements/responsibilities for the T-2 equipment.
     3.2.4.2. PMs, lead commands, and test organizations may create ―   umbrella‖ or ―  blanket‖
     T-2 modification proposals that cover a specified period of time or series of test activities
     for the purpose of conducting incremental hardware and software Developmental Test &
     Evaluation/Qualification Test & Evaluation (DT&E/QT&E), or to identify a range of test
     support equipment that may be installed in support of T&E activities. In this case, the T-
     2 modification proposal enables PMs, lead commands, and test organizations to install
     and remove developmental materiel (hardware and software), or specific pieces of test
     support equipment on designated test assets without the need for repeated configuration
     management reviews and approvals. However, in such cases, PMs, lead commands, and
     test agencies shall collaborate as necessary to maintain accurate and up-to-date
     configuration control of effected test assets, and to coordinate specific materiel
     installation requirements and activities.
     3.2.4.3. T&E organizations and lead commands shall assist the PM as necessary to
     ensure the operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness of T-2 modified assets that are
     maintained IAW AFI 63-1201, and to ensure T-2 modified assets are provided sufficient
     sustainment support as needed to complete directed T&E activities.
     3.2.4.4. T-2 modifications will be maintained on the test asset(s) for as long as necessary
     to complete T&E activities specified in approved test plans, and then be removed,
     returning the asset to its original or current approved permanent configuration.
     Instrumentation data collection and other support equipment used for both current and
     future test data collection requirements are not normally removed after each test. Such
     assets will be removed when no longer required, or the instruments/test support system
     become obsolete.
     3.2.4.5. T-2 modifications will normally be removed prior to input for PDM. T-2
     modifications not removed prior to PDM should be coordinated with the PDM
     organization.
     3.2.4.6. A T-2 modification may be used to test and evaluate a proposed permanent
     configuration change. Upon the conclusion of T&E activities, the lead command, in
     coordination with PM, shall determine if the modification will be permanently adopted.
     If adopted, the T-2 mod may remain in place upon completion of T&E activity while a
     permanent modification proposal is processed and implemented IAW the provisions of
     this instruction. The T-2 modified asset will be upgraded to the approved permanent
     configuration as part of the permanent modification program.

3.3. Permanent Modifications. Permanent (P) modifications change the configuration of an
asset to effect a lasting improvement in the operational effectiveness, suitability, survivability,
and/or ownership costs of a fielded weapon system, subsystem, or item. Some permanent
modifications are further designated as safety modifications.
   3.3.1. Permanent modifications are used to satisfy requirements approved IAW AFI 10-601.
   An approved permanent modification includes the inherent authority to install developmental
   components of the modification on test assets for the purposes of conducting engineering
   investigations, developmental testing, and/or other evaluation of the modification. An
   approved permanent mod also includes the inherent authority to perform trial kit installations
   and kit proofing activities in order to verify the installation procedures and sustainment
   elements associated with the modification prior to full-rate kit production and/or fleet-wide
   installation.
   3.3.2. Permanent capability modifications shall only be accomplished in response to an
   approved AF Form 1067 or JCIDS document. However, PMs may initiate systems
   engineering tasks and preliminary design activities for permanent capability modifications in
   anticipation of an approved AF Form 1067 or JCIDS Document, but must consider the
   technical complexity and maturity of the stated need, along with programmatic risk, when
   preparing modification program strategies and plans. In such cases, the PM will limit
   expenditures while the requirement is undergoing coordination and approval. The
   modification requirement must be fully documented in an approved AF Form 1067 or JCIDS
   document prior to program initiation.
   3.3.3. Permanent capability and sustainment modifications will normally be installed across
   the entire inventory of the host weapon system or product line. However, when necessary to
   support operational mission requirements, permanent modifications may be installed on a
   subset of the host weapon system or product line inventory with the approval of the lead
   command and the applicable PM.
   3.3.4. Permanent modifications may be conducted in discrete installation segments (e.g.,
   ― Group A‖ and ―  Group B‖ segments) when necessary to support operational mission or
   deployment requirements or to cost effectively manage the host weapon system or product
   line inventory. In this case, the content of each modification segment must be approved by
   the lead command and the applicable PM.
   3.3.5. Permanent capability and sustainment modifications will be provided full logistics
   support (e.g., spares, support equipment, technical data, and serialized item management)
   commensurate with the host system or component maintenance concept and product support
   strategy/plans. Consult AFI 63-101 for sustainment planning requirements associated with
   AF acquisition and sustainment programs.
3.4. Permanent-Safety (P-S). P-S modifications are permanent modifications that correct
materiel or other deficiencies which could endanger the safety or health of personnel, or cause
the loss of, or extensive damage to systems or equipment. P-S modifications are primarily
conducted to correct materiel deficiencies which caused a Class A mishap, per the provisions of
AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and as identified in an Air Force Safety Center
Memorandum of Final Evaluation.
AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                            21


   3.4.1. Whether directly associated with a Class A mishap or not, permanent modification
   proposals designated as P-S shall meet the following criteria:
       3.4.1.1. IAW MIL-STD-882D, the underlying deficiency has been determined by the PM
       to be a ―serious risk‖ (or higher) of causing injury to personnel or extensive damage to
       equipment, and,
       3.4.1.2. The PM has performed a risk analysis to determine the proposed modification is
       technically feasible, operationally effective, and sustainable, and,
       3.4.1.3. The Chief of Air Force Safety has approved the lead command‘s request to
       designate the proposed modification as a safety modification.
   3.4.2. P-S modifications shall be given priority for funding and implementation over all
   other pending modifications.
   3.4.3. P-S modifications will be accomplished IAW with the provisions of this instruction.
   However, PMs may deviate from the provisions of this instruction when necessary to prevent
   loss of life or minimize risk to personnel. PMs may, in coordination with the lead command,
   issue interim procedures or operating restrictions, and install temporary modifications as
   necessary prior to implementing a P-S modification. Refer to AFI 21-101 for additional
   guidance in this area.
3.5. Low Cost Modification. Low cost modification policy guidance can be applied to
modifications of in-service weapon system or other end item of equipment that meet the criteria
of AFI 65-601V1 described below:
   3.5.1. Is designed to correct minor product quality defects or other deficiencies within the
   scope of the item‘s established functional baseline and/or system specification(s), or,
   3.5.2. Is designed to correct minor reliability, maintainability, durability, or product safety
   deficiencies, including parts obsolescence or other supply support issues with the item, and,
   3.5.3. Requires less than $2.0M total to fully implement the modification, including all non-
   recurring and recurring costs, and,
   3.5.4. Can be accomplished within twelve months.
3.6. Modifications to Assets Planned for Retirement (a. k.a. Sunset Provisions). IAW Title
10 U.S.C 2244a , Equipment Scheduled For Retirement Or Disposal: Limitation On
Expenditures For Modifications, permanent modifications to any aircraft (i.e., a given tail
number), weapon, or other item of equipment that the SECAF plans to retire or otherwise
dispose of within five years after the date on which the modification, if carried out, would be
completed, are prohibited. Exceptions to this prohibition include modifications which:
   3.6.1. Cost less than $100,000
   3.6.2. Have reusable items of value installed as part of the modification that will, upon the
   retirement or disposal of the modified item, be removed from that item, refurbished, and
   installed on another piece of equipment, and the cost of this modification, including the cost
   of removal and refurbishment of reusable items of value, is less than $1M, or,
   3.6.3. Are designated as safety modifications, or,

   3.6.4. The SECAF has determined to be in the national security interest of the United States,
   and has so notified the Congressional defense committees in writing.
3.7. Additional Modification Requirements. In addition to the general modification program
management requirements prescribed in this instruction, modification activities involving certain
types of materiel may impose additional management requirements on the using/lead command
and PM.
   3.7.1. Modifications in Response to Urgent Operational Needs. Materiel modifications
   necessary to satisfy validated UONs will be prioritized over all other modifications except
   safety modifications. Additionally, though UONs typically involve compressed acquisition
   timelines, PMs shall ensure all modification programs responding to a UON comply with the
   life cycle systems engineering and product sustainment guidance in Chapter 2 of this
   instruction and other applicable AFIs. Prior to being released to the field, modifications
   responding to validated UONs will be appropriately tested by a cognizant test agency, and
   necessary product certifications will be accomplished. For additional information on the
   development, processing, approval, and implementation of UONs, refer to AFI 10-601 and
   AFI 63-114, Rapid Response Process.
   3.7.2. Modifications to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Certified Aircraft.

                                          Chapter 4

                        MODIFICATION PROPOSAL PROCESS

4.1. Modification Proposal Overview. The modification process starts with the identification
of the modification need/requirement and ends when the modification is implemented and the
modification program is terminated. This chapter describes the process for developing and
approving modification proposals, and for executing modification programs that implement the
approved proposal.
   4.1.1. A modification proposal is the document or combination of documents needed to
   initiate and execute the modification management process. A modification proposal consists
   of 4 steps: 1) defining the modification requirement, 2) validating the modification
   requirement, 3) determining the technical requirements and solution, and 4) certifying and
   approving a modification proposal.
4.2. Defining the Modification Requirement. All modifications whether a capability or
sustainment modification must be driven by a validated requirement. The PM shall ensure that
there is a validated requirement that has been defined and documented IAW the process and
criteria outlined in AFI 10-601 prior to initiating the modification.
   4.2.1. AF Form 1067. The AF Form 1067 is the document normally used to initiate a
   modification proposal for fielded systems and equipment. The 1067 satisfies both elements
   of a modification proposal by providing a means to describe the modification requirement,
   and a means to capture the technical aspects associated with the materiel solution that
   satisfies the requirement. The 1067 is also used to establish the requirement for all
   temporary modifications, regardless of cost. The 1067 also provides a means for the system
   or commodity manager with configuration control and engineering authority over the
   effected asset(s) to document the technical parameters associated with the modification, such
   as systems engineering requirements and recommendations, impacts to logistics support
   elements associated with the asset(s), and the type and amount of funding necessary to
   accomplish the modification. The 1067 provides a means for tracking modification
   proposals through the modification approval process, and assists in identifying Configuration
   Items to be effected by the modification.
   4.2.2. Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Documents. For
   permanent modifications that are estimated to exceed 10% of ACAT II dollar thresholds, the
   requesting organization must complete a formal JCIDS document to establish the user‘s
   modification requirement(s). Although AFI 10-601 does not always require an AF Form
   1067 to document requirements, an AF Form 1067 can be used in order to document the
   configuration impacts, reference the legacy requirement, and initiate a specific modification
   activity. Consult AFI 10-601 for detailed information on the AF requirements generation and
   JCIDS document preparation and approval processes.
   4.2.3. Urgent Operational Need (UON). Requirements for solutions to UONs are
   established in accordance with the guidance in AFI 10-601 and AFI 63-114. Warfighter
   UONs that emerge during conflicts or other crisis situations often involve modifications to
   in-service weapon systems and equipment. UON capability requirements are normally
   established via a message that is generated by a combatant command or an AF MAJCOM,
 26                                           AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010


   and forwarded to Headquarters Air Force (HAF) for information. In the event a UON cannot
   be satisfied at the MAJCOM level, the need is forwarded to HAF in form of a Combat
   Capability Document (CCD). Unless there is an approved JCIDS document, an AF Form
   1067 is generated and processed to summarize the modification requirement, to document the
   technical parameters necessary to satisfy the urgent need, and to initiate the modification
   management processes. For modification programs responding to an approved COCOM
   UON or MAJCOM CCD, the PM shall coordinate technical requirements and funding for the
   modification directly with the UON/CCD sponsor.
   4.2.4. Other Modification Proposal Documents. Other documents, such as airworthiness
   directives produced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and service bulletins
   developed by defense industry manufacturers may also fulfill required elements of a
   modification proposal.
   4.2.5. Documenting the Requirement
      4.2.5.1. Individual personnel in operational units, sustainment organizations, or with
      management oversight of a system will initiate a modification proposal by completing
      Blocks 1 through 10 of the AF Form 1067 IAW this AFI, MAJCOM procedures, and
      local instructions. Modification proposals developed in response to a UON will include
      this statement in Block 9 of the AF Form 1067: ―   This modification is needed to address
      an Urgent Operational Need.‖ The initiator shall then submit the 1067 to the unit focal
      point for organizational validation (1067 Block 11; see paragraph 4.3.1 below).
      4.2.5.2. PM-Initiated Modification Proposals. The PM for a given asset may also
      develop an AF Form 1067 to initiate a modification proposal. In this case, the PM shall
      submit the AF Form 1067 to the applicable lead command for validation (AF Form 1067
      Part III; see paragraph 4.3.3 below).
4.3. Validating a Modification Proposal. Validation is the process whereby units and
MAJCOMs concur with a modification proposal, and verify the requirement is a valid
organizational need that requires a materiel solution. Validation does not mean that an
organization approves the proposed materiel solution or authorizes its implementation.
   4.3.1. Organizational Validation (AF Form 1067 Block 11). A modification proposal
   submitted by an individual shall first be validated within the initiator‘s organization, using
   procedures established by the parent MAJCOM and/or local instructions implemented within
   the organization. The organization shall forward the validated AF Form 1067 to the parent
   MAJCOM for further review and action.
   4.3.2. Using Command Validation (AF Form 1067 Part II). The initiator‘s parent MAJCOM
   headquarters shall validate the AF Form 1067 IAW established MAJCOM procedures. If the
   proposed modification affects an AF weapon system identified in AFPD 10-9, or a
   communications/ information system designated in AFI 10-901, the using command shall
   then forward the validated AF Form 1067 to the applicable lead MAJCOM or other AFPD
   10-9/AFI 10-901 designated organization for further review and action.
   4.3.3. Lead Command Validation (AF Form 1067 Part III). The lead MAJCOM or AFPD
   10-9/AFI 10-901 designated organization shall validate the proposed modification and
   materiel solution(s) via prescribed requirements and processes established by the command.
   The lead Command shall coordinate the modification proposal with all affected using
AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                            27


   commands and supporting organizations, such as training and logistics support units. Lead
   commands/organizations shall forward all proposed permanent-safety modifications to the
   Chief of Air Force Safety for coordination and approval of the safety designation. Once
   validated, the lead command shall prioritize the modification proposal for funding and
   implementation. Modification proposals designated for funding and implementation will be
   forwarded to the applicable PM for initial technical evaluation, implementation program
   planning, and cost estimation (1067 Part IV; see paragraph 4.4 below).
   4.3.4. Modifications Involving Multiple Lead Commands. For modifications involving
   multiple mission variants within a given asset design-series that are assigned to multiple lead
   MAJCOMs (e.g., AC/C/EC/MC/HC/WC-130, C/KC/RC/WC-135), each lead MAJCOM
   shall validate the modification proposal against their assigned assets, and the lead MAJCOM
   responsible for the largest number of assets within the given design-series will have overall
   responsibility for validating and approving the modification proposal. If the modification
   proposal is ultimately approved, each lead MAJCOM shall determine whether to implement
   the modification on its assigned assets.
4.4. Determining the Technical Requirements, Implementation Strategy, and Costs of a
Modification Proposal (1067 Part IV).
   4.4.1. Initial Technical Evaluation. The PM, with the assistance of the systems
   engineering authority for the affected Configuration Item(s), shall determine preliminary
   technical impacts and systems engineering-related requirements to implement the proposed
   modification IAW AFI 63-1201. Such evaluations will include:
      4.4.1.1. Determination of the impacts to the host weapon system/ component‘s
      operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness (OSS&E) baseline, as well as any
      operating certifications or restrictions associated with the host weapon
      system/component, such as airworthiness certifications, munitions carriage/employment
      certifications, environmental safety and occupational health certifications, and security
      certifications.
      4.4.1.2. This evaluation will also determine the potential impacts to, and any corollary
      modification requirements for training systems/devices and intelligence or information-
      related systems and networks that may be required to operate, maintain compatibility
      with, or sustain the proposed modification.
      4.4.1.3. The PM shall also determine the sustainment support needs associated with the
      proposed modification, including system/product reliability, availability, maintainability,
      and supportability impacts and requirements.
      4.4.1.4. The PM shall also conduct a risk analysis and safety assessment for the proposed
      modification, and identify any necessary risk acceptance documentation, safety
      certifications, or statements that must accompany the modification IAW AFI 63-101, AFI
      91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and MIL-STD-882D.
      4.4.1.5. The PM shall determine if the modification will involve or produce critical
      program information (CPI).
28                                           AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010


     4.4.1.6. The PM shall ensure this initial technical evaluation encompasses all
     Configuration Items and external interfaces whose functional/product baselines may be
     affected by the proposed modification.
        4.4.1.6.1. The PM shall coordinate these initial technical and programmatic
        requirements with other effected system/product management entities, such as ALCs,
        training system program management offices, technology development organizations,
        etc.
        4.4.1.6.2. The PM shall denote the modification category (i.e., primarily a capability
        modification or a sustainment modification) in Part IV of the 1067 and in applicable
        modification program plans.
     4.4.1.7. Preliminary Implementation Strategy. In conjunction with the initial technical
     evaluation of a proposed modification and in coordination with the lead command, the
     PM shall develop a preliminary strategy to implement the modification. This strategy
     will address the management approach to implementing the modification and include, at
     a minimum, a top-level description of how the modification should be funded, developed,
     tested, produced, fielded, and supported, along with an estimated schedule for
     implementing the modification.
     4.4.1.8. Cost Estimation. When requested by the lead command, the PM shall develop
     formal cost estimates to implement the proposed modification IAW procedures
     prescribed in AFPD 65-5, Cost and Economics as well as the AFI/AFMAN 65-500 series
     publications and approved AFMC/AFSPC cost estimating techniques. This estimate
     shall include all costs associated with the development, production, operation, and
     sustainment of modification throughout its expected life cycle. Any cost estimates
     provided by commercial vendors or other government agencies will be validated by the
     PM. For temporary modifications, this estimate shall include costs for host system de-
     modification and disposal (as applicable). Low cost modifications do not require
     preparation of formal, detailed cost estimates. Additional cost estimating requirements
     are prescribed in AFI 63-101 and AFPD 65-5, and applicable AFI/AFMAN 65-500 series
     publications.
     4.4.1.9. Program Manager Assessment and Recommendation. The PM shall provide the
     completed technical evaluation, preliminary implementation strategy and schedule, and
     cost estimates to the lead command, along with any other specific recommendations
     concerning the development, production, installation, testing, and sustainment
     requirements associated with proposed modification. Depending on the complexity of
     the modification, the maturity and availability of critical technology elements of the
     modification, and other external factors such as the availability of funding, the PM may
     provide the lead command with implementation courses of action that offer alternative or
     evolutionary approaches to satisfy the operational requirement or stated need.
     4.4.1.10. Certification of Requirements Feasibility. The PM shall attest to the feasibility
     of the proposed modification requirement by including the following statement in Part IV
     of the 1067 ― operational requirement(s) described in this modification proposal is
                   The
     (are) technically achievable and executable within the estimated schedule and budgeted
     life cycle costs identified herein.‖ For modification proposals initiated with a JCIDS
AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                         29


     document, PMs shall follow internal AFMC/AFSPC procedures for attesting to the
     feasibility of ICD/CCD/CPD requirements.
  4.4.2. Certifying, Approving, and Funding a Modification Proposal (1067 Part V). The
  lead command shall review the PM‘s initial technical evaluation, implementation strategy
  and schedule, and cost estimates, then approve the modification for implementation, suspend,
  or terminate the Modification Proposal. Once the modification is fully approved (Part IV and
  Part V are signed by authorized individuals) and designated for implementation, the lead
  command and PM shall revise and coordinate a final implementation strategy with effected
  using commands, support/sustainment organizations and other stakeholders associated with
  the modification. Once all management reviews and approvals are completed, the
  modification proposal will be catalogued and maintained IAW applicable records
  management requirements. Modification proposal documents shall be maintained as needed
  to provide a permanent record of the user‘s requirement, and as needed for configuration
  control purposes throughout the modified asset‘s life cycle.
  4.4.2. (AMC) Upon completion of PM evaluation/project plan development, Part IV, the
  AF Form 1067 and supporting documentation is returned to HQ AMC/A4MMP for final
  review and resubmission to the CRB for final command certification. See Para 2.9.3 (AMC)
  for certification of T-2 modifications.
     4.4.2.1. Modification Approval Thresholds: Permanent modifications projected to cost
     in excess of $30M (total expenditure, FY2000 constant year dollars) must also be
     approved by AF/A5R. In this case, the lead MAJCOM submits the completed 1067 to
     AF/A5R, accompanied by a transmittal memorandum and a requirements correlation
     table that contains threshold and objective requirements for key system attributes and
     other attributes associated with the proposed modification. See AFI 10-601 for further
     details on modification approval thresholds.
     4.4.2.1. (AMC) The CRB reviews and certifies the modification package as received
     from the PM. If the CRB certifies a modification package, it is returned to the applicable
     Lead Command AO. HQ AMC/A4MMP forwards a copy of the certified proposal to the
     submitting unit, the PM, and HQ AMC/A5Q for funding prioritization and program
     oversight. If disapproved for certification, the modification is returned to the AO for
     rework.
     4.4.2.2. Funding Modifications. Lead commands shall coordinate the source of funding
     for approved modification proposals with the PM and, as applicable, the HAF Program
     Element Monitor (PEM) with cognizance over the affected weapon system, component,
     or program element code. Funding sources for temporary and permanent modifications
     will be identified IAW AFI 65-601V1 and established AF budget guidance. Program and
     budget authority documents for modification programs will be processed IAW standard
     financial management processes.
     4.4.2.2. (AMC) If the AF Form 1067 is disapproved, the AO reworks the AF Form
     1067, with the originator, to answer any questions posed by the CRB or returns the AF
     Form 1067 to the originator with disapproval explanation.
     4.4.2.3. Modification Funding - General Guidelines. The following paragraphs provide a
     top-level overview of modification funding requirements. Consult AFI 65-601V1 for
30                                           AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010


     detailed guidance on the authorities, processes, and requirements associated with funding
     modification programs.
     4.4.2.3. (AMC) HQ AMC/A5Q will determine if further requirements documentation is
     needed, notify the Using Command HQ POC (Block 3, AF Form 1067), and forward the
     AF Form 1067 to AF/A5R if required IAW AFI 10-601. HQ AMC/A5Q will notify the
     sponsoring organization if a Requirements Strategy Review (RSR) is required IAW AFI
     10-601 and assist in the preparation of an RSR briefing for the Air Force Requirements
     Oversight Council (AFROC) and AF/A5R. AMC/A5Q, with assistance from the
     appropriate subject matter experts, will prepare the appropriate requirements documents
     IAW AFI 10-601. In all cases involving radio frequency (RF) devices, AMC/ A5Q will
     ensure the statement; ― RF devices must be certified for spectrum supportability in the
                            All
     operational environment before the aircraft is returned to AMC for mission deployment‖
     is included in the AF Form 1067 and all further requirements documents IAW AFI 10-
     601. The respective Systems/Sustainment Division is responsible for submitting requests
     for frequency allocation and approval no later than the critical design review of the item.
        4.4.2.3.1. Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Funds. RDT&E funds are
        generally used to fund initial hardware and software development efforts up to the
        point where an operational baseline configuration has been designed, developed,
        tested, qualified, and accepted by the government. RDT&E funds are also used to
        increase the capability or performance of a weapon system, subsystem, or component
        beyond existing specifications or performance levels, and to implement new hardware
        and software technologies that involve exploratory development and/or prototyping
        activities.
        4.4.2.3.2. Procurement Funds. Procurement funds are generally used to manufacture
        and install modification ―kits‖ in fielded assets, as well as other hardware and
        software components associated with the modification. Procurement funds may also
        be used to fund certain non-recurring systems engineering tasks in support of end
        item or kit production.
        4.4.2.3.3. Operations and Maintenance Funds. O&M funds are generally used to
        maintain hardware and software components that have been placed in service. O&M
        funds are used for expense materials that are not part of a mod kit, but are determined
        to require replacement during inspection and modification activities. Use O&M
        funds when conducting engineering studies to determine if reliability/maintainability
        efforts should proceed to the modification production phase. O&M also fund
        improvements in software for which the Air Force has unlimited data rights.
        4.4.2.3.4. Modification programs may involve the use of multiple appropriation types
        in order to implement the modification. Different appropriations may be necessary to
        fund separate and distinct tasks associated with the modification. For instance,
        RDT&E funds will often be necessary to design and test the modification, while
        procurement funds are often required to produce and install the modification.
        Modification programs will comply with Full Funding Policy detailed in AFI 65-
        601V1 and DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, Chapter 1.
        4.4.2.3.5. New Start Notifications. Any modification program or project that has not
        been previously justified to and approved by Congress during the appropriations
AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                            31


        process for the fiscal year involved is considered a new start. When a determination
        has been made that a modification proposal meets new start criteria, Congress must
        be notified via either a letter of notification or a completed Department of Defense
        Form 1415-1, Prior Approval Reprogramming Action. Modifications that result from
        FAA-issued service bulletins are also considered new starts if they are not consistent
        with the ―Service Bulletin‖ budget line item materials provided to Congress. Refer to
        AFI 65-601V1 and DOD 7000.14-R, Department of Defense Financial Management
        Regulation, Volume 3, Chapter 6 for specific requirements, processes, and
        stipulations associated with new start notifications.
        4.4.2.3.6. Individual modifications funded in the ―  Low Cost Modification‖ budget
        line item are generally not considered new starts. However, any modification
        proposal which exceeds the low cost modification budget threshold ($2M for the
        entire modification effort) or is inconsistent with the budget justification materials
        provided to Congress regarding this line item is subject to new start guidelines and
        approvals.
     4.4.2.4. (Added-AMC) The office of the Using Command HQ POC (Block 3, AF Form
     1067), when notified further documentation is required, will provide the threshold and
     objective for all attributes of the requirement with supporting rationale and analysis. If an
     RSR is required, the Using Command HQ POC will prepare the RSR and brief the
     AFROC and AF/A5R. After the RSR is approved, the Using Command HQ POC will
     support AMC/A5Q in preparation of the appropriate requirements documents.
     4.4.2.5. (Added-AMC) Commercial derivative aircraft are maintained IAW AFPD 62-
     6, USAF Airworthiness, and at a minimum will use Federal Aviation Regulations as a
     baseline for airworthiness whenever practical. All modifications must be approved with
     the respective government Systems/Sustainment Division. HQ AMC/A4M and the
     Program Office will decide who reviews and coordinates aircraft modification proposals.
 32                                            AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010


                                           Chapter 5

                     MODIFICATION PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

5.1. Modification Program Management Overview. Permanent and temporary modifications
shall follow all statutory and regulatory requirements commensurate with the program
designation (APML, SPML, or other) and the type and level of funding.
   5.1.1. All AF modification activities shall be led by a PM/SPM who shall have overall
   management authority, and be held accountable to accomplish the development, production,
   and sustainment objectives for a given modification activity. The PM shall be the individual
   with day-to-day management responsibility for implementing an approved modification
   proposal, and for reporting cost, schedule, and performance information associated with the
   modification activity to higher authorities. All modification activities on the APML, SPML,
   or in continued materiel support of an AFPD 10-9 designated weapon system shall be
   assigned a single Program Manager (PM) or System Program Manager (SPM).
   5.1.2. The PM shall coordinate planning, programming, and execution of the modification
   with all impacted AFPD 10-9 designated weapon systems SPM(s).
   5.1.3. The PM leads in executing the modification program. Functional representatives
   within the program, regardless of location or whether that person supports the program on a
   full-time or part-time basis, should report to and take program direction through the PM.
   Functional staffs external to the program are not accountable for program execution; they are
   responsible for providing trained human resources and advice to the PM. Functional Staffs
   include: System Sustainment Managers, Developmental System Managers, Chief/Lead
   Engineers or Project Managers.
   5.1.4. All temporary and permanent modifications will satisfy an approved requirement
   documented in a 1067 or a formal JCIDS product as described in Chapter 4 of this
   instruction.
   5.1.5. All modifications that meet the criteria for an ACAT shall comply with DOD 5000
   series, AF 63 series, and other applicable AF regulations that address ACAT execution. All
   other Sustainment activities that result in a modification shall execute the modification using
   the process detailed in the remainder of this chapter.
5.2. Document the Modification Plan. The PM is responsible for completing and coordinating
sufficient documentation to address the following requirements:
   5.2.1. Program Baseline. For all permanent modifications, the PM will establish baseline
   technical performance objectives, cost targets/controls, and schedule objectives at program
   initiation. For all other modification activities, PMs may use AFMC/AFSPC-prescribed
   forms to document the technical performance, cost, and schedule baselines for the
   modification program.
      5.2.1.1. Prior to issuing a final request for proposal, a contract, or finalizing internal
      government work specifications, the PM shall establish a technical requirements baseline
      for the modification program. The technical requirements baseline for the modification is
      derived from the operational requirement(s) specified by the organization(s) that
      requested and approved the modification proposal.
AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                          33


     5.2.1.2. For all T-1 modifications, a 1067 approved by the lead command provides the
     source for the technical requirements baseline. For modification involving an ECP, use
     the technical description of the engineering change(s) contained in the ECP for
     developing the technical requirements baseline.
  5.2.2. Modification Strategy. All permanent capability and sustainment modification
  programs will have a documented and approved modification strategy that defines
  goals/objectives, organizational responsibilities, activities, timelines, and information
  requirements necessary to execute the program and support timely decision-making
  throughout the duration of the modification activity. At a minimum, this modification
  strategy will include:
     5.2.2.1. A description of the overall modification and strategy for delivery. If an
     evolutionary approach is planned, include a description of the capability that will be
     provided in each planned increment.
     5.2.2.2. The contracting approach that will be used to achieve program objectives and
     include pertinent top-level contract requirements, terms, conditions, and performance
     incentives.
     5.2.2.3. Risk-based decision support requirements and risk management tools that will be
     employed during the program. Consult AFI 63-101 for additional information
     concerning risk management and risk-based decision making for AF programs.
     5.2.2.4. An integrated master plan (IMP) that identifies the progression of events and
     activities necessary to accomplish the modification, along with critical tasks to be
     conducted and their completion or success criteria.
     5.2.2.5. An integrated master schedule (IMS) that identifies planned start-stop dates for
     the events and tasks identified in the IMP, as well as any inter-relationships or
     dependencies between these events or tasks. The IMS will include an overall critical path
     for the modification program.
     5.2.2.6. An intelligence assessment of the threat environment the modification will be
     operated in. This assessment will also identify any intelligence-related services, data, or
     products necessary to support the design, development, operation, and sustainment of the
     modification. Refer to AFI 63-101 and AFI 14-111, Intelligence in Force Modernization,
     for further guidance in this regard.
     5.2.2.7. An assessment of the maturity and availability of technologies required to
     provide the requisite capability or satisfy the stated need. If necessary, the PM shall
     develop a technology development strategy to ensure necessary technologies are matured
     in a manner and on a schedule that supports program objectives. PMs shall not initiate
     detailed modification design and development activities unless the critical technology
     elements of the modification have been assessed at a technology readiness level of 6 or
     higher.
     5.2.2.8. An assessment of government and/or contractor manufacturing capability and
     readiness to produce modification components in the timeframe required by the user.
34                                            AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010


     5.2.2.9. An assessment of the reliability, availability, maintainability, and supportability
     requirements associated with the modification. Refer to AFI 63-101 for additional
     guidance in this area.
     5.2.2.10. An assessment of the training and training system requirements associated with
     the modification. System training device peculiar modifications (e.g., image generation
     systems, motion systems, etc) not associated with a corresponding weapon
     system/equipment modification will be proposed and approved via a separate 1067.
     Consult AFI 36-2248, Operation and Management of Aircrew Training Devices and AFI
     36-2251, Management of Air Force Training Systems, for additional guidance in this
     area.
     5.2.2.11. The acquisition approach that will be used to achieve program objectives. At a
     minimum, this acquisition approach will include:
     5.2.2.12. A description of the overall modification strategy. If an evolutionary approach
     is planned, include a description of the capability that will be provided in each planned
     increment.
     5.2.2.13. Pertinent top-level contract requirements, terms and conditions, and
     performance incentives.
     5.2.2.14. Risk-based decision support requirements and risk management tools that will
     be employed during the program. Consult AFI 63-101 for additional information
     concerning risk management and risk-based decision making for AF programs.
  5.2.3. Systems Engineering Approach. The PM, with support of the chief/lead engineer,
  identifies critical systems engineering tasks and considerations necessary to define and
  allocate change requirements, design, develop, test, produce, and field the modification. The
  SE approach must consider operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness (OSS&E) human
  systems integration (HSI), environmental safety and occupational health (ESOH), product
  and system integrity, maintenance engineering/sustaining engineering, configuration
  management, Aircraft Information Programs, software engineering, and mission assurance.
  5.2.4. Engineering Data/Technical Data. The PM shall ensure development and acquisition
  of engineering data is sufficient for the acquisition, maintenance, spares, and repair in
  support of the modification. The PM shall provide verified technical order procedures for
  fielding of a modification that will be organically supported. The data required for T-1 and
  T-2 modifications shall be developed and acquired commensurate with the modification
  scope, duration, and employment.
  5.2.5. Product Support Requirements and Plans. All temporary and permanent modifications
  need to plan for sufficient logistics support to ensure the modification is sustainable for the
  duration of its intended life cycle.
     5.2.5.1. For T-1 modifications, the lead/using MAJCOM(s) and the PM shall determine
     the minimum essential support necessary to accomplish, operate and maintain the
     modification during its limited installation lifespan.
     5.2.5.2. For T-2 modifications, the lead/using MAJCOM(s), the PM, and participating
     test organizations will collaboratively determine modification sustainment support
     requirements and responsibilities. For permanent modifications, the PM shall develop a
AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                          35


     product support strategy that identifies how the modification will be sustained over its
     intended life cycle, including support requirements at the organizational (field)
     maintenance level, intermediate (backshop) maintenance level, and the depot level, as
     applicable.
     5.2.5.3. For all other permanent modification activities, the modification support strategy
     will be documented by the PM and approved by the applicable SPM, PGM, or
     commodity manager with cognizance over the item(s) to be modified. All temporary and
     permanent modification programs will be structured such that requisite logistics support
     elements are delivered in advance of, or concurrently with the installation of the
     modification.
     5.2.5.4. If Interim Contractor Support (ICS) is planned, the PM shall include a plan for
     funding ICS and address the transition of ICS to organic or contract or a combination of
     contract and organic sustainment and identify the beginning and ending dates of the ICS.
     ICS does not negate the PM‘s responsibility to achieve an organic and/or a contractor
     support capability as early as practicable or the requirement for testing and/or
     demonstrating the adequacy of a system, equipment, or end-item. Note: In planning for
     Continuity of Services, the PM will consider the need for and request application of
     Federal Acquisition Regulation Clause 52.237-3 to secure contractor support during the
     transition period.
  5.2.6. Test and Evaluation Requirements and Plans. All modifications will be tested as
  necessary to verify system/product technical performance against contract specifications and
  evaluate the modified asset against the approved operational requirement(s). A T&E strategy
  will be documented by the PM and approved by the applicable SPM, PGM, or commodity
  manager. Information on testing and evaluating system can be found in AFI 99-103.
  5.2.7. Training Requirements and Plans. In coordination with the lead/using MAJCOM(s),
  PMs shall ensure personnel training requirements (e.g., training programs and courseware,
  training equipment and manuals, training facilities) necessary to train and qualify/certify
  operator and maintenance personnel on the modification are provided as an integral part of
  the modification program. IAW AFI 36-2248 and AFI 36-2251, the PM shall assist the lead
  command with the determination of training and training system requirements necessary to
  operate and sustain the modification. When requested by the lead command, the PM shall
  assist in developing a system training plan for the modification. The PM shall ensure all
  training systems and materials associated with the prime mission system are modified and
  delivered prior to, or in conjunction with the modifications to the prime mission system.
  5.2.8. Expectation Management. Expectation management establishes program credibility
  and accountability through formal, recurring communication among stakeholders and is the
  cornerstone of the ILCM process. Significant reasons to actively manage expectations are 1)
  developers, users, and sustainers often interpret requirements differently, 2) program changes
  occur throughout development and are not always documented which impacts cost, schedule,
  performance, and risk which affect end-item deliverables, 3) different users may have
  different views of probability of success, and 4) expectations can drift apart over time
  through leadership/personnel changes. The roles and responsibilities of expectation
  management cut across the acquisition, sustainment, and operational user communities.
  Program changes or other influences that drive expectation adjustments must be made clear
 36                                            AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010


   to the most senior leaders who have responsibility for the success of a modification. The PM
   shall ensure effective expectation management of the modification across the life cycle.
   Additional information on documenting expectations can be found in AFPAM 63-128, Guide
   to Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management [when published].
   5.2.9. Program Protection Requirements and Plans.               For all T-1 and permanent
   modifications, the PM shall assess and determine if the modification will involve or produce
   sensitive technologies or other critical program information (CPI) that must be protected. If
   the modification includes such technologies or CPI, the PM shall work with supporting
   systems engineering functions and HAF Directorate of Special Programs (SAF/AQL) as
   necessary to identify, develop, implement, and validate anti-tampering measures and other
   resources needed to protect the critical information identified with the proposed modification,
   and document these matters in a program protection plan. Refer to AFI 63-101 for additional
   information concerning program protection requirements and plans.
   5.2.10. Data Rights Planning. The PM shall ensure access to technical data resulting from
   the modification (recorded information used to define a design and to produce, support,
   maintain, or operate a system) that is critical to the life cycle sustainment of a system. The
   PM shall ensure decisions made early in the planning process address data needs over the
   entire life cycle of the system. The PM shall assess long term data rights requirements and
   corresponding acquisition strategies prior to initiating a request for proposal.
5.3. Report and Monitor Modification Program Status. The PM shall initiate and maintain
program data to include, at a minimum, cost, schedule, performance, test, logistics, contracts,
finance, risk, and earned value (as applicable) and report periodically through the Integrated life
Cycle Management governance chain of authority.
5.4. Field the Modification. Permanent modifications are generally installed on AF weapon
systems and equipment using a Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) prepared IAW AFI
63-101 and TO 00-5-15, Air Force Time Compliance Technical Order Process. Contractor-
provided field service bulletins and FAA-issued airworthiness directives and service bulletins
may also prescribe specific modification installation procedures and requirements. Temporary
modifications are generally installed using a technical/engineering data package that describes
the system/component engineering changes and outlines the component modification instructions
to be accomplished. This data package must be approved by the applicable system/component
engineering authority prior to installation.
   5.4.1. Modification Fielding Strategy/Plans. The PM shall coordinate modification
   installation requirements and timelines with the lead command and all effected organizations,
   including ALCs and logistics support contractors as necessary. The PM shall ensure
   sufficient planning is conducted in advance of modification installation activities to allow the
   lead and using commands sufficient time to identify, understand, and resolve any fielding
   issues associated with the modification. Additionally, the PM shall ensure sufficient time is
   provided to develop and field any infrastructure or other product support requirements that
   will be necessary to operate and sustain the modification once it is fielded.
   5.4.2. Approval/Authority to Install Modifications. All modification installation documents
   shall be approved by the system/component engineering authority and the PM via formal
   configuration management process.        Once approved, the PM shall coordinate the
   modification installation schedule with all effected organizations and receive approval for
AFI63-131_AMCSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                          37


   installation from the lead command. Prior to trial kit installation, T&E activities, or field
   operation, the PM shall issue any requisite certifications that accompany the modification,
   such as safety of flight releases or airworthiness certifications.
      5.4.2.1. Exception: Modifications to AF systems and equipment whose engineering
      authority is a non-Air Force executive agent shall be approved by that executive agent. If
      such modifications are funded by the AF, the AF PM shall also approve the modification
      prior to installation. The executive agent is not required to produce an installation TCTO
      if a comparable document is produced.
      5.4.2.2. Modification Installation Methods. Temporary and permanent modifications
      may be installed at base level by organic unit/MAJCOM personnel that initiated the
      modification proposal, by PM and ALC field teams, and by contractor logistics support
      personnel, or a combination thereof. Modifications may also be conducted in conjunction
      with depot maintenance activities, at contractor facilities, or a combination thereof.
      Permanent modifications will normally include a trial kit installation and/or a kit-proof
      event that is conducted to verify the functionality of the modification, to validate
      installation procedures and timelines, and to verify logistics support items such as
      peculiar support equipment interfaces, technical manual changes, etc.
5.5. Modification Program Close-out. Proper disposal will be insured for modification kits
that become excess. For configuration control and management purposes, a complete copy of
the modification package will be permanently maintained IAW AFI 33-364, Records Disposition
Procedures and Responsibilities.
   5.5.1. All temporary modifications will close out when they are replaced by permanent
   modifications or removed from the host system or component as specified in the approved
   AF Form 1067.
   5.5.2. When a TCTO is or will be rescinded, and there are excess kits, the Program Manager
   shall verify that all affected systems/items/equipment spares have been modified and ensure
   authority is obtained to disassemble/dispose of excess kits per AFMAN 23-110, USAF
   Supply Manual, Volume 3 and
   5.5.3. Technical data, which exists prior to the modification, must be retained until all
   affected systems/items/equipment have been modified. When the last asset has been
   modified, all pre-existing data must be updated by formal changes or revisions to technical
   data/manuals, thus ensuring the current configuration is reflected.
   5.5.4. When the modification has been completed, shipping or disposition instructions for
   government furnished equipment/material must be provided. The MDA or SPM shall be
   notified when modification kit installation has been completed and the TCTO has been
   rescinded.
   5.5.5. Unsuccessful completion of the modification must also be documented including the
   reason for termination and any plan to recover assets.
