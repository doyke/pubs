This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-2, Air Force Readiness.
The Inspection Checklist is developed to support AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities,
and the AFI 90-201_USAFE Supplement 1. This checklist identifies compliance items that
support guidance in the following: law, executive order, higher headquarters publication (DoD,
JCS, FAA, AFI, AFMAN, AFTO, etc.) and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE)
publications. This checklist supports guidance in AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training
System, as well as the associated USAFE supplement. This checklist is intended for inspections
and Staff Assistance Visits. In addition, higher headquarters inspection/assistance teams reserve
the right to inspect, evaluate and assess areas not listed on this checklist, however, as directed in
JCS, Air Staff, and MAJCOM guidance. It applies to all USAFE, measured units, Subordinate
Reporting Organizations (SRO), as well as, the individual measured units. This publication does
not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG) and the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and
their units. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of
command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This checklist incorporates previously published USAFE guidance and policy messages.
1. General.     The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or
assessment.     As a minimum, units should use these checklists in conjunction with their unit self-
assessment.      The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required
capabilities.    Higher headquarters may use this guide in whole or in part during visits or
exercises.
     1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items
     identified by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the HQ
     USAFE Inspector General (HQ USAFE/IG) to assess criticality of deficiencies.
         1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as
         key result areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to,
         items where non-compliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost,
         litigation or affect system reliability. These requirements may be mandated by law,
         Executive Order, DoD directive, safety or Air Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs
         are referred to as significant guide items requiring direct IG evaluation. Identify CCGIs
         by using uppercase and bold letters.
         1.1.2. CGI. CGIs are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall
         performance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on
         mission performance but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation.
         Identify CGIs by using uppercase.
2. Applicability. All items on this checklist are assigned an applicability code designating the
wing/unit/installation to which the item applies. Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) are
also subject to inspection using this checklist.
