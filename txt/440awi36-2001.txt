           application.
           1.2.7.2. Positions for the Non-EAD Commissioning Program will be forwarded by

     will convene even if only one package is submitted.
     3.2. Board members assess each package using the whole person concept. Factors such as
     duty performance, job responsibility, experience, supervisory and leadership ability,
     professional competence, education, AFOQT scores, military bearing and appearance, and
     verbal communication skills are considered. The board members evaluations are then
     converted to a numerical score between 1 and 100 in whole numbers (Attachment 9). The
     board will determine the numerical value cutoff.
     3.3. Each individual being considered appears before the selection board for a formal
     interview in service dress. This occurs during the same period the board convenes. The board
     will interview the candidate(s) to receive insight into the total person concept. If a member is
     unable to interview during the scheduled month (due to deployment, training, etc), the board
     will conduct a record review. The member will be expected to appear before the selection
     board for the formal interview when the next board meets.
     3.4. The selection board will generate a list of candidates eligible for commission within a
     year’s time frame. Once a valid vacant position is established for the 440 AW, the list will be
     supplied to selecting officials. Selecting officials may conduct further interviews prior to
440AWI36-2001 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                             7


  making final selection. If an eligible member has not been commissioned after one year, the
  member’s commander may request the member remain on list of eligible candidates
  (Attachment 10).

                                STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING
In submitting an application to become a commissioned officer in the Air Force Reserve, I understand that should I
be selected and commissioned, securing a Reserve Officer position is my responsibility. Furthermore, in accordance
with AFRCI 36-114, Procedures on Air Reserve Technicians (ART) who Lose Active Membership in the Reserve,
14 Feb 97, para 3.3.9., I understand that becoming a commissioned officer will result in loss of active membership
in the Reserve as an Enlisted ART for reasons considered to be within my control and that upon receiving
commission, I face immediate removal from my ART position. I fully understand that there are no entitlements or
priorities for consideration of placement into an ART Officer position or non-ART civilian position due to loss of
active enlisted membership in the Reserve resulting from my commission as an Air Force Reserve Officer.
Endorsement:
I understand and accept the aforementioned conditions.
