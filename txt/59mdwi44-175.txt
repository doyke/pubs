______________________________________________________________________________

This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 44-1, Medical Operations. This medical
wing instruction prescribes policies and procedures to health care personnel assigned to the 59th
Medical Wing (MDW) to ensure that our patients’ rights to privacy and modesty are provided in
a consistent manner, and to decrease the risk of allegations of improper examinations by 59
MDW staff. Patients of both sexes have the right to a chaperone. It is our responsibility to
ensure that patients know this, and to make a chaperone available when requested. If there is any
doubt whether or not to use a chaperone, the best course of action is to use one. This publication
applies to all personnel assigned, attached, or on contract to the 59 MDW. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) on the Air Force Portal available at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changed series number from 41 to 44 and added requirement to display Visual Aid 41-108,
Chaperone Policy. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

1. Responsibilities.
2                                                           MDWI 44-175 18 JANUARY 2006

1.1. Clinic personnel have a responsibility to inform patients that they may always request a
chaperone be present for any physical exam. Prior to examining potentially sensitive areas such
as the genitalia, rectum, or the female breast, a provider must again offer the patient a chaperone.

1.2. The medical staff should elicit the patient’s preferences as to what constitutes a desirable
chaperone. However, the chaperone must be the same gender as the patient being examined. If
all attempts to find a suitable chaperone fail, then the patient will be offered the option to
reschedule the exam or treatment. Once a suitable chaperone is located, the chaperone’s name
should be annotated in the medical record whenever possible to allow the Air Force to identify
and locate the chaperone if an allegation of misconduct is later made. Providers should
understand that documenting the chaperones’ name is to protect them days, weeks, or months
later when an allegation surfaces and the provider cannot recall the chaperone’s name.

1.3. Patients may decline the right to be chaperoned and this should be carefully documented in
the patient’s medical record.

1.4. The provider has the right to:

1.4.1. Have a chaperone present if they feel it is professionally prudent.

1.4.2. Refuse to examine a patient for a routine, non-emergent matter if the patient refuses a
chaperone and the provider feels the examination is sensitive or professionally compromising.
However, the provider must immediately notify their superior so that alternate care arrangements
can be made.

1.4.3. Providers may request that a chaperone be present for any patient interaction. If in doubt,
providers should opt on the side of having a chaperone present. If the patient refuses to allow a
chaperone, the provider may choose to withdraw from care. However, the provider must
immediately notify his/her superior so that alternate care arrangements can be made.

2. Education and Training.

2.1. Each group is responsible for educating and training providers and staff on the role of
chaperones, procedures and responsibilities under this instruction, procedures for resolving
questions on the use of chaperones, and procedures for identifying and reporting suspected
misconduct.

2.2. During emergencies or life threatening situations, medical personnel are not required to
offer the presence of a chaperone.

2.3. Volunteers will be trained on the duties of a chaperone and procedures for identifying and
reporting suspected misconduct upon assignment to the area.

2.4. Training for volunteers will be documented on an AF Form 2519, All Purpose Checklist,
which will include at least the following:

2.4.2. Confidentiality.

2.4.3. Patient sensitivity issues.

2.4.4. Infection control.

2.4.5. Monitoring of procedures.

2.4.6. The checklist will be annotated, signed by the trainee and the trainer, and will be filed in
the volunteer’s education and personnel folder. Volunteers will provide the Director of
Volunteer Services a copy of the completed checklist.

2.4.7. Visual Aid 41-108, Chaperone Policy offering a chaperone must be conspicuously present
in every exam room and clinic area.

2.4.8. Volunteers that are minors will not be utilized as chaperones.

3. Form Adopted.
