                                          INTRODUCTION

1.1. Background:
   1.1.1. In February 1974 the Nonconsumable Item Subgroup (NIS) was chartered to eliminate unnec-
   essary duplication in management and logistics support of multiused nonconsumable items. The NIS
   prepared Joint Service Regulation AFLCR 400-21, AMC-R 700-99, NAVSUPINST 4790.7, MCO
   P4410.22, Wholesale Inventory Management and Logistics Support of Multiservice Used Noncon-
   sumable Items, which contained provisions for the assignment of specific single wholesale manage-
   ment responsibilities on all nonconsumable items except those in the following categories:
       1.1.1.1. Conventional ammunition items under the cognizance of the Single Manager for Conven-
       tional Ammunition (SMCA).
       1.1.1.2. Cryptologic items under the cognizance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
       1.1.1.3. Nuclear items under the cognizance of the Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA).
   1.1.2. The Joint Service Regulation prepared by the NIS addressed Interchangeable and Substitutable
   issues for nonconsumable items. Many hindering factors to the implementation of these concepts
   within DoD led to the establishment of the Interchangeable and Substitutable Item Subgroup (ISIS) to
   develop detailed requirements for the design and implementation of a DoD I&S system applicable to
   both consumable and nonconsumable material.

1.2. Purpose. This publication provides policy for the execution of the DoD I&S Program. Authorized
procedures for the DoD I&S Program are detailed in DoD 4100.39-M, Federal Logistics Information Sys-
tem (FLIS) Procedures Manual. This publication contains policy and uniform guidance governing:
   1.2.1. Identification of families of National Stock Numbered (NSN) I&S items.
   1.2.2. Criteria for determining the master item of each family and its related items.
   1.2.3. Criteria to be used in the determination and assignment of a single wholesale manager for each
   family of I&S items.
   1.2.4. Criteria for the operation of the I&S system.
   1.2.5. Criteria for inclusion of I&S information in logistics decision-making processes.

1.3. Objectives:
   1.3.1. Eliminate unnecessary duplication in the wholesale inventory management of I&S items by:
       1.3.1.1. Identifying DoD families of I&S items for subsequent determination of single wholesale
       management assignments.
       1.3.1.2. Providing a standard method of inter-Service/Agency (S/A) I&S communications
       through the FLIS.
       1.3.1.3. Precluding future inventory management duplication on multiused I&S items.
       1.3.1.4. Using DoD standard systems and procedures to the maximum extent possible.
4                                                                    AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997

1.4. Scope:
    1.4.1. This publication provides the necessary guidance for identifying a single wholesale manager
    for each I&S family of items, whether consumable or nonconsumable, except for those exclusions
    addressed in the following paragraph.
    1.4.2. Items under the management of SMCA, NSA and DSWA are excluded from the purview of this

                                        DOD I&S PROGRAM

2.1. General. The DoD I&S Program portrays those technical decisions of the managing and/or using S/
A which involve I&S relationships between items of supply. The I&S Program maintains the integrity of
I&S data by ensuring that I&S items are managed only in a family context and that items in an I&S family
are consistently managed by a single wholesale manager. Procedures for the I&S Program are contained
in DoD 4100.39-M.

2.2. Principles:
   2.2.1. The I&S Program observes the following principles:
   2.2.2. Each I&S family will have a master item designated which is suitable for use as a substitute by
   all users of any item in the family.
       2.2.2.1. Single wholesale management assignment on master items will be based largely upon
       precedents for such integrated material management assignments.
       2.2.2.2. Master items which are consistently managed as consumables will be managed by the
       Integrated Material Manager (IMM) designated according to DoD 4140.26-M, Defense Integrated
       Materiel Management Manual for Consumable Items.
       2.2.2.3. Master items which are consistently managed as nonconsumables will be managed by the
       single wholesale manager assigned according to Joint Service Regulation AMC-R-700-99, NAV-
       SUPINST 4790.7, AFMCR 400-21, MCO P4410.22, Wholesale Inventory Management and
       Logistics Support of Multiservice Used Nonconsumable Items.
       2.2.2.4. Master items which are inconsistently managed will normally be assigned to the service
       which manages the item as a nonconsumable.
   2.2.3. Single wholesale management assignments will be consistent within an I&S family.
       2.2.3.1. When a master item has been assigned to a single wholesale manager, that S/A will also
       be assigned integrated material management responsibilities for the remaining items in the family.
       If appropriate and according to item management criteria of DoD 4140.26-M, Logistics Reassign-
       ment (LR) action will be initiated by the manager of the master NSN in order to align family man-
       agement assignments.
       2.2.3.2. The assigned single wholesale manager will perform wholesale support responsibilities
       for all related items in the family irrespective of its retail user interest, or lack thereof, on any
       related item within the family.
       2.2.3.3. In order to promote consistent wholesale management assignments within a family, all
       members of the family will be assigned or reidentified through managing and using S/A collabo-
       ration to the same Federal Supply Class (FSC). Where practical, the FSC of the master item will
       prevail.
   2.2.4. Wholesale management performed by the family wholesale manager will be according to the
   I&S coding assigned by each respective S/A. The single wholesale manager will assure equal treat-
   ment to all customers without regard to S/A affiliations.

    2.2.5. Material management functions not assigned to the single wholesale manager will remain the
    responsibility of the using S/A.

2.3. Family Structure:
    2.3.1. When two or more NSNs are determined to have I&S relationships an I&S family will be estab-
    lished subject to the following concepts and constraints:
    2.3.2. An I&S family is a group of items which possesses physical and functional characteristics that
    provide comparable performance to satisfy given requirements under given conditions. Further, an
    I&S family contains the full range of items identified by the managing or using S/A to be interchange-
    able or substitutable with or for each other and for which a common interchangeable/substitutable
    master item exists.
    2.3.3. An I&S family must have a master item which is suitable for use in lieu of any other item
    within the I&S family and agreed to by all using S/As.
    2.3.4. An I&S family may contain one and only one generic NSN and that NSN must be the master
    item.
    2.3.5. Each item in an I&S family must reflect retail interest by either the managing or one or more
    using S/As.
    2.3.6. Neither the PICA S/A nor any individual using S/A need have retail interest in all items in the
    family.
    2.3.7. Any S/A which has retail interest in any related item in the family must have, or establish, retail
    interest in the master item as well.
    2.3.8. An I&S family is limited to 50 NSNs.
    2.3.9. An I&S family group is that range of items within an I&S family which is assigned to an indi-
    vidual S/A for management or in which a using S/A has retail interest.
       2.3.9.1. Each S/A must have as the master item of its I&S family group the master item of the
       family.
       2.3.9.2. The managing S/A must reflect all items in the family in its family group.
       2.3.9.3. A managing or using S/A may have retail interest in the family master item only, unless
       the master item is a generic NSN. When the family master item is a generic NSN, each managing
       or using S/A must establish retail interest in one or more of the related generic items of supply.
    2.3.10. An I&S family subgroup is that range of items within a family group which are interchange-
    able with each other. Items which have no interchangeable relationship with any other item are the
    sole member of their subgroups. Items which are not interchangeable are assigned different subgroup
    code values.
       2.3.10.1. When a generic I&S relationship exists in an I&S family, the generic NSN will always
       be the master item. There can only be one generic NSN for each I&S family. Each managing or
       using S/A of the I&S family must have or establish requirements for the generic master NSN and
       at least one related item in the generic subgroup.
       2.3.10.2. Within a family group, items which are interchangeable will be assigned to the same
       subgroup; items which are substitutable will be assigned to different subgroups.
AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997                                                                                9


      2.3.10.3. Subgroups will be limited to a maximum of 26 NSNs.

2.4. Data Base Maintenance:
   2.4.1. Family structures and I&S coding assignments will conform to the provisions of this instruc-
   tion and the FLIS Procedures Manual, DoD 4100.39-M, Volume 6, Chapter 6.
   2.4.2. The wholesale manager of the family is the sole activity authorized to revise the family struc-
   ture.
   2.4.3. The wholesale manager and each using S/A will be responsible for revisions to its respective
   I&S coding assignments.
   2.4.4. Using S/A will be notified through FLIS file maintenance procedures of revisions to the family
   structure and revisions to the I&S coding assignments of the wholesale manager when such revisions
   affect family members on which the S/A has a MOE Rule recorded.
   2.4.5. The wholesale manager will be provided through FLIS file maintenance procedures with the
   I&S coding assignments of each using S/A and will be notified of revisions to such coding assign-
   ments submitted by the S/A.
   2.4.6. Processing of revisions to family structures and revisions to I&S coding assignments will con-
   form to appropriate effective-date criteria in order to preclude inter S/A data conflicts within I&S fam-
   ilies.
   2.4.7. Authorized activities will be able to interrogate the FLIS for I&S data per the procedures stated
   in DoD 4100.39-M.
   2.4.8. The assigned manager of a family will maintain visibility of the I&S coding assignments of all
   S/A users of the family within its own data base in order to ensure that user I&S assignments are con-
   sidered in logistics decision making processes.
   2.4.9. Using S/As will maintain visibility of their own I&S determinations on a basis which is com-
   patible with FLIS processing requirements and the procedures herein.

2.5. I&S Coding:
   2.5.1. I&S coding will be assigned or specified by each managing or using S/A for items within its
   respective I&S family group to document S/A technical determinations on I&S relationships per DoD
   4100.39-M.
10                                                                     AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997

                                       LOGISTICS OPERATIONS

3.1. General:
     3.1.1. This chapter contains policy and guidance for making logistics determinations on items in or
     proposed for inclusion in I&S families. This guidance governs the establishment, maintenance, and
     use of I&S families.

3.2. Objectives:
     3.2.1. Maintain consistent wholesale management assignments within I&S families.
     3.2.2. Optimum use of I&S materiel assets to satisfy customer requirements and S/A programs/
     projects.
     3.2.3. Uniform application of I&S information in logistics decision-making processes.
     3.2.4. Progressive attrition of related item assets from S/A inventories.
     3.2.5. Deletion/cancellation of related NSNs from active DoD inventory records as pertinent lines of
     application are deleted or demand activity ceases.

3.3. Collaboration:
     3.3.1. All I&S family collaboration actions will be coordinated using JLC Form 47, DoD I&S Family
     Collaboration Request, completed according to Attachment 3 of this instruction.
     3.3.2. Concurrence on I&S family structures obtained during collaboration will contain sufficient jus-
     tification to establish the proposed family structure in the FLIS. Concurring S/A will subsequently
     assign their individual I&S data consistent with collaboration agreements.
     3.3.3. Nonconcurrence on I&S family structures expressed during the collaboration process will be
     based on technical determinations that propose I&S relationships. Nonconcurrences must be justified
     in all cases.
     3.3.4. Collaboration is required when:
        3.3.4.1. Managing activities will collaborate with using S/A on all new or revised I&S family
        structures prior to the entry of the I&S families in the FLIS data base, except for those relation-
        ships coordinated through the DoD Standardization Program's item reduction study process.
        3.3.4.2. A managing S/A proposes to establish an I&S family, collaborate with all S/A users of the
        proposed master item and proposed related items.
        3.3.4.3. A managing S/A proposes to delete an existing I&S family, designate a new master item
        for an existing family, or add a new related item to an existing family, collaborate with all S/A
        users of the existing and proposed family members.
        3.3.4.4. A managing S/A proposes to delete a related item from an existing I&S family. However,
        if that related item has previously been referred to the Defense Inactive Item Program (DIIP) and
        all users have furnished a delete decision, no further collaboration will be required.
AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997                                                                             11


      3.3.4.5. A using S/A proposes to revise an I&S family structure. Collaborate with the manager of
      the existing family; or, if a new I&S family is proposed, collaborate with the manager of the pro-
      posed master item, who will then initiate further collaboration action with all other using S/As.
   3.3.5. Collaboration is not required when:
      3.3.5.1. A managing or using S/A revises their I&S coding (i.e., OOU codes, JTCs and/or phrase
      codes) in an existing family without revising the structure of the family.
      3.3.5.2. A using S/A adds I&S data to an item currently in an I&S family, but not in its respective
      S/A family group.
      3.3.5.3. A using S/A deletes its I&S data on an item in an I&S family in conjunction with with-
      drawal of interest on the item, where other registered S/A continue retail interest in the item.
   3.3.6. Post Collaboration:
      3.3.6.1. When collaboration results in concurrence with a new or revised I&S family structure, the
      following actions will be taken:
          3.3.6.1.1. The manager of the new or revised family is responsible for initiating required LR
          actions, registering all users of the new or revised master item, registration on related items,
          and submission of I&S data on the new revised family.
          3.3.6.1.2. The manager's I&S data assignments will be provided to using S/A per the FLIS
          procedures. The using S/A, upon receipt of the notification of the recording of the manager's
          I&S in FLIS, will submit their respective S/A I&S coding assignments for FLIS processing.
      3.3.6.2. When collaboration results in nonconcurrence with a new or revised I&S family struc-
      ture, the following actions will be taken:
          3.3.6.2.1. The items involved will continue to be managed on the current basis. Items not
          approved for inclusion in the family will continue to be managed external to the proposed I&S
          family arrangement.
          3.3.6.2.2. A managing or using S/A registered on items not commonly approved for inclusion
          in the family may at its option, assign non I&S phrase codes to such items.
          3.3.6.2.3. When exclusion of an item from an I&S family will cause inconsistent wholesale
          management assignments between/among items which have a practical I&S relationship in at
          least one service, a using service may request LR on the established I&S family to eliminate
          duplication of wholesale inventory management. The wholesale manager of the family will
          evaluate such requests and initiate what LR actions are necessary to eliminate the management
          inconsistencies.
      3.3.6.3. S/A disagreements may be elevated through S/A channels in an effort to achieve resolu-
      tion of differences.

3.4. Wholesale Manager Assignments:
   3.4.1. Policy:
      3.4.1.1. Wholesale management and S/A sources of supply (SOS) must be consistent within an
      I&S family.
12                                                                    AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997


        3.4.1.2. Management responsibilities for an I&S family will be logistically reassigned between S/
        As when necessary to maintain consistent wholesale management within families or when such
        action will eliminate duplication of wholesale inventory management.
     3.4.2. Procedures:
        3.4.2.1. When an item in the DoD inventory is proposed as an intended related item, the propos-
        ing S/A will collaborate according to collaboration criteria in paragraph 3.3. In such cases:
            3.4.2.1.1. If all S/A users of the proposed related item and the existing family concur with the
            proposed family structure, the new related item will be processed for assignment to the present
            wholesale manager of the existing family irrespective of managing S/A retail interest in the
            item.
            3.4.2.1.2. If one or more S/A users of the proposed related item or the existing bachelor item
            or family indicate nonconcurrence with the proposed family structure, new I&S relationship
            will not be established. A using S/A with a practical I&S relationship may assign a non-I&S
            phrase code to the excluded item.
        3.4.2.2. When an item is proposed as a replacement for an existing bachelor item or an item in an
        existing I&S family, the introducing or proposing S/A will collaborate according to collaboration
        criteria in paragraph 3.3. In such cases:
            3.4.2.2.1. If all S/A users of the proposed master item and the existing family concur with the
            proposed family structure, the new master item will be assigned as follows:
               3.4.2.2.1.1. If the existing bachelor item or family is DLA-managed, the new master item
               will be assigned to the current DLA ICP unless the item qualifies for service retention of
               management responsibilities. If service retention of the new master item is warranted, the
               introducing or proposing service will be assigned as the wholesale manager of the item and
               the remaining items in the restructured family will be logistically reassigned to that service
               according to DoD 4140.26-M.
               3.4.2.2.1.2. If the existing bachelor item or family is Service-managed, the new master
               item will be assigned to the current service ICP unless the item qualified for assignment of
               an IMC which specifies DLA management. If DLA management of master item is war-
               ranted, the DLA ICP having FSC responsibility will be assigned as the wholesale manager
               of the item and the related items in new or restructured family will be logistically reas-
               signed to that DLA ICP according to DoD 4140.26-M.
               3.4.2.2.1.3. If the existing bachelor item or family is Lead Service Primary Inventory Con-
               trol Activity (LS PICA) managed and the Nonconsumable Item Materiel Support Code
               (NIMSC) is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 or 9, the new master item will be assigned to the current
               PICA. The Secondary Inventory Control Activity (SICA) will specify to the PICA the new
               master item SICA NIMSCs which are compatible with those assigned to the remaining
               items in the restructured family. If the new master item reflects a Depot Source Of Repair
               (DSOR) decision which differs from the DSOR decision on the remaining items in the
               restructured family, the PICA will document the matter with its service’s Maintenance
               Interservice Support Management Office (MISMO) representative to promote a consistent
               DSOR decision for the family. If the NIMSC is 5 or 6, either the PICA or the SICA or both
               will document the matter with the respective service’s MISMO representative. If the
AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997                                                                                13


              resultant DSOR decision designated PICA service as the depot maintenance service for the
              family, the restructured family may be logistically reassigned to that service.
          3.4.2.2.2. If one or more S/A users of the proposed master item, existing bachelor item or fam-
          ily indicated nonconcurrence with the proposed family structure, new I&S relationship will
          not be established. A using service with service unique I&S relationship may assign non I&S
          phrase codes to the excluded item, the existing bachelor item or master item. These will be
          processed as follows:
              3.4.2.2.2.1. If the existing bachelor item or family is DLA-managed, the excluded item
              will be assigned to that DLA ICP unless the item qualifies for service retention of manage-
              ment responsibilities.
              3.4.2.2.2.2. If the existing bachelor item or family is service managed, the excluded item
              will be assigned to the Service ICP only if that service has retail interest in the excluded
              item. If the Service ICP has no retail interest, the introducing or proposing service will be
              assigned as the wholesale manager of the item.
              3.4.2.2.2.3. If the existing bachelor item or family is LS PICA managed with NIMSC 1, 2,
              3, 4, 7, 8 or 9, the excluded item will be assigned to the PICA only if that service has retail
              interest in the item. If the PICA has retail interest in the excluded item, the PICA will
              assign SICA NIMSCs determined by the SICAs to be consistent with SICA support
              requirements for both the excluded item and the established family. Assignment of NIMSC
              5 or 6 must be mutually agreed to by the PICA and SICA. If the PICA has no retail interest
              in the excluded item, the introducing or proposing service will be assigned as the whole-
              sale manager. No LR action on the established family will be requested if assigned NIMSC
              is other than 5 or 6.

3.5. Provisioning:
   3.5.1. Policy:
       3.5.1.1. Provisioning of new systems and equipment, as well as provisioning of systems and
       equipment currently in the DoD inventory which are being adopted for service use, will be the
       responsibility of the requiring service.
       3.5.1.2. Provisioning screening processes will provide the provisioning service with visibility of
       existing and pending I&S relationships.
       3.5.1.3. Initial provisioning requirements will be satisfied to reduce new DoD investment in mate-
       riel inventories by applying available assets of I&S items to emergent provisioning requirements
       on a technical/engineering basis.
   3.5.2. Procedures:
       3.5.2.1. A service receiving responses to provisioning screening requests will review data on
       existing or pending I&S relationships and will determine which items in the existing or pending
       I&S family are applicable to the system or equipment being provisioned.
          3.5.2.1.1. Full consideration will be given to the potential use of related items in the family, as
          well as the master item.
14                                                                     AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997


            3.5.2.1.2. When it is determined that related items as well as the master item will satisfy antic-
            ipated provisioning requirements on a technical/engineering basis, the provisioning service
            will make preliminary determinations of the I&S relationships/I&S coding assignments which
            will be relevant to subsequent adoption of the items.
        3.5.2.2. When a service projects provisioning requirements on an item which will replace an
        existing bachelor item or family, or will necessitate restructuring of a family to establish appropri-
        ate I&S relationships, the provisioning service will collaborate with the registered users according
        to the criteria in paragraph 3.3.

3.6. Item Adoption:
     3.6.1. Policy:
        3.6.1.1. When a using S/A is registered on a related item in an I&S family, that S/A will be regis-
        tered concurrently on the master item if master item registration is not recorded.
     3.6.2. Procedures:
        3.6.2.1. S/A requesting adoption action will submit separate documentation on each family mem-
        ber being adopted.
        3.6.2.2. When submitting a user registration action on a related item, the managing S/A will sub-
        mit concurrent user registration on the master item as well if master item registration is not
        recorded for the using S/A. The managing S/A response to the adoption action request will advise
        the using S/A of the concurrent registration action.
        3.6.2.3. Initial and replenishment support quantities projected by applicable transaction will be
        reflected on the least preferred acceptable related item to promote maximum utilization of avail-
        able assets. The managing S/A will record projections of initial or replenishment support quanti-
        ties against the items on which the projections were made pending user assignment of I&S data to
        the items.
        3.6.2.4. S/A adopting a nonconsumable item in a LS PICA managed family will submit a separate
        JLC Form 17, Nonconsumable Item Materiel Support Request (NIMSR), on each family
        member being adopted.
            3.6.2.4.1. When NIMSRs are submitted on more than one item in an I&S family, the related
            NSN will be listed in NSN (Suitable Subs) in block 9, JLC Form 17, and if more space is
            required continue to list in remarks block.
            3.6.2.4.2. NIMSR submission on multiple items in an I&S family will request the same level
            of support (that is, SICA NIMSC assignment) in block 4, JLC Form 17.
        3.6.2.5. An Integrated Material Manager (IMM) for consumable items, upon receipt of a customer
        requisition from a nonregistered S/A, will submit user registration actions when automatic regis-
        tration criteria are met.
            3.6.2.5.1. Notification provided to a requisitioning S/A incident to processing of a requisition
            on a nonregistered item will identify the requisitioned item. If the item is a related item in an
            I&S family and the requisitioning S/A is not registered on the master item, the notification will
            also identify the master item.
AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997                                                                              15


          3.6.2.5.2. A using S/A need not submit a Supply Support Request (SSR) if automatic registra-
          tion has occurred, the requisition was for a related item and the using service was previously
          registered on the master item.
          3.6.2.5.3. If the requisition was for the master item or if concurrent automatic registration has
          occurred, the using S/A will submit an SSR for the master item and for the related item, as
          appropriate.
          3.6.2.5.4. If requisitioning S/A specifications preclude automatic registration, an SSR will be
          submitted for the master item and/or the related item, as appropriate, in order to gain registra-
          tion.
      3.6.2.6. Upon receipt of a customer requisition for a nonconsumable item from a nonregistered
      service, the LS PICA will not automatically register the requisitioning service.
          3.6.2.6.1. Irrespective of the supply action taken on the requisition, the PICA will advise the
          customer to submit requisitions using its own service SICA.
          3.6.2.6.2. The PICA will notify the requisitioner of the nonregistered item. If the item is a
          related item in an I&S family and the requisitioning service is not registered on the master
          item, the notification will also identify the master item.
          3.6.2.6.3. In response to PICA notification of a requisition for a nonregistered nonconsumable
          item, the using service will submit a NIMSR for the master item or the related item, if registra-
          tion is desired.
      3.6.2.7. When an item other than the master is requisitioned and user registration is to be
      accomplished on that item and the master, the managing S/A, at that time, must review the rela-
      tionship which had previously been established without the requisitioning S/A collaboration.

3.7. Cataloging:
   3.7.1. Policy:
      3.7.1.1. The wholesale manager of the family will be the single submitter/cataloger for all items
      in the family. Cataloging actions will be prepared and submitted according to the procedures in
      DoD 4100.39-M.
          3.7.1.1.1. Managing S/A will be responsible for collaboration of cataloging actions, including
          revisions to family structures, and for resolving collaboration conflicts prior to submission of
          cataloging revisions to FLIS.
          3.7.1.1.2. Using S/A will be responsible for assigning and maintaining S/A Catalog Manage-
          ment Data (CMD), including I&S data.
          3.7.1.1.3. I&S data transactions will be subject to appropriate effective date processing crite-
          ria.
      3.7.1.2. Managing S/A will be registered on all items in their respective I&S families, with con-
      sistent manager MOE rules assigned. Using S/A will be registered only on those items in I&S
      families for which they have retail interest but must be registered on the master item if registered
      on any related items.
16                                                                     AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997


            3.7.1.2.1. Managing and using S/A will assign I&S data to those I&S items in their respective
            I&S groups on which they have registration.
            3.7.1.2.2. Service IMMs for consumable items and LS PICAs for nonconsumable items will
            assign distinctive I&S data to those I&S items in which they have no retail interest.
            3.7.1.2.3. I&S data will conform to the specifications in DoD 4100.39-M.
        3.7.1.3. Managing and using S/A will assign CMD which reflects consistent SOS within I&S
        family groups.
        3.7.1.4. Managing S/A will maintain visibility of the I&S data assignments of all S/A users within
        their respective data bases. Using S/A will maintain visibility of their own I&S determinations
        within their respective data bases.
        3.7.1.5. All services if possible, will associate each item in I&S families with appropriate end
        item or next higher assembly information to facilitate the deletion of related items from I&S fam-
        ilies as last lines of application are deleted. Such application information will be maintained in the
        respective service data bases.
     3.7.2. Procedures:
        3.7.2.1. A managing S/A will establish an I&S family by assigning pertinent I&S data to items
        collaborated according to FLIS procedures.
            3.7.2.1.1. A managing S/A must ensure that all users of the related items are registered on the
            master item of the family. User registration may be accomplished concurrent with manager
            assignment of I&S data.
            3.7.2.1.2. A managing S/A will assign Order Of Use (OOU) codes to all items in the family
            according to the paragraph 2.5. of this instruction. Service IMM for consumables or LS PICA
            will assign OOU code value ZZZ to those items in which it has no retail interest, and OOU
            code value XXX to the master item if it is the sole member of the family in which the manag-
            ing service has retail interest.
            3.7.2.1.3. A managing S/A will assign Jump To Code (JTC) values as required to identify
            items which, based upon manager technical determinations/applications, have no I&S rela-
            tionship with each other, but do have a common substitutable item. JTCs will be assigned
            according to paragraph 2.5. of this instruction.
            3.7.2.1.4. A managing S/A may develop I&S phrase codes based upon knowledgeable engi-
            neering decisions which are translated into manager assigned OOU code values. I&S phrase
            codes will be assigned/generated according to DoD 4100.39-M.
            3.7.2.1.5. A managing S/A may concurrently assign I&S and non-I&S cataloging data, sub-
            ject to FLIS edit/validation criteria.
        3.7.2.2. DLSC will provide manager assigned I&S data to each using S/A as a recommended I&S
        alignment of the family.
            3.7.2.2.1. The data provided to each using S/A will be tailored so as to provide recommended
            I&S coding only for those items on which the S/A has I&S registration. No notification will be
            provided to a using S/A which has registration only on the master item of the family.
AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997                                                                            17


          3.7.2.2.2. DLSC will monitor using S/A response to notifications and will provide follow on
          notifications of delinquent responses according to existing FLIS procedures.
          3.7.2.2.3. Each using S/A will respond to FLIS provided notification by submitting its own S/
          A I&S data on items having respective S/A registration as applicable. A using S/A may assign
          OOU code values, JTC values or I&S phrase codes or may have such coding automatically
          assigned by Defense Logistic Service Center according to S/A specifications for FLIS assign-
          ment of I&S data. All I&S data will be assigned in accordance with the paragraph 2.5.
          3.7.2.2.4. DLSC will validate I&S data transactions and related data and provide notification
          of valid I&S data according to procedures contained in DoD 4100.39-M.
          3.7.2.2.5. Each managing or using S/A will maintain approved I&S data within its respective
          database
          3.7.2.2.6. Each managing/using service will associate each I&S item with application data in
          its respective data base to promote deletion of obsolete items from the respective family group
          and ultimately, the family.

3.8. Pricing:
   3.8.1. Policy:
       3.8.1.1. The PICA will establish and maintain the unit prices (standard prices and reduced stan-
       dard prices) on all items within I&S families being managed.
       3.8.1.2. Standard prices for master items of I&S families will be based on current market or pro-
       duction costs, plus applicable surcharges.
   3.8.2. Procedures:
       3.8.2.1. A managing S/A will establish and maintain standard prices for items in I&S families.
       Standard prices will be based on current acquisition costs plus authorized surcharges, and will be
       subject to revision at intervals specified for standard price reviews.
       3.8.2.2. When materiel issues are made which require reimbursement, a managing S/A will sub-
       mit billing transactions based on the standard price of the item issued. When issues are made
       against a family member which has a different standard price from the item originally requisi-
       tioned, notification of the financial adjustment will be furnished to all activities concerned.
       3.8.2.3. A using S/A will maintain standard price data on I&S items in its CMD and its own data
       base according to the following criteria:
          3.8.2.3.1. On consumable IMM managed items, the standard price will be assigned by the
          manager not withstanding using S/A OOU code or subgroup content differences with that of
          the managing S/A.
          3.8.2.3.2. On LS PICA managed items supported on a Phase I (NIMSC 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 or 9)
          basis, the standard price will be assigned by the manager not withstanding SICA I&S coding,
          unless SICA procurement costs incurred on Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request
          (MIPR) substantially differ from the standard price or SICA interservice financial manage-
          ment technique permits an additional interservice surcharge.
18                                                                   AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997


                3.8.2.3.2.1. When SICA procurement costs (MIPR/Direct) appear to require a different
                standard price (standard or reduced standard) the SICA will submit a recommended price
                change. The PICA will review and either disapprove or establish a new standard price.
                3.8.2.3.2.2. When interservice surcharges are permitted, they will be applied consistently
                to the manager assigned standard price on every item in the SICA service family group.
            3.8.2.3.3. For LS PICA managed items supported on a Phase II (NIMSC 5 or 6 ) basis, the
            standard price will be assigned by the manager. When surcharges are permitted, they will be
            applied consistently to the manager-assigned standard price on every item in the I&S family.
            3.8.2.3.4. Standard prices and changes there to will be promulgated according to DoD
            4100.39-M.

3.9. Logistics Reassignments:
     3.9.1. Policy:
        3.9.1.1. LR will be made as necessary to achieve consistent wholesale management assignments
        within I&S families.
        3.9.1.2. According to existing procedures, LR actions on I&S items will be initiated by the gain-
        ing inventory manager.
        3.9.1.3. When wholesale management responsibilities for I&S families are transferred between S/
        A, LR actions on all members of the family will be subject to processing on the same Effective
        Transfer Date (ETD).
        3.9.1.4. With the exception of Phase I nonconsumable items (NIMSC 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 & 9), the losing
        S/A will maintain retail support capabilities while permitting the gaining S/A to assume wholesale
        support responsibilities without disruption to customer support. Asset transfers/decapitalization
        will be made on ETD.
     3.9.2. Procedures:
        3.9.2.1. The procedures in DoD 4140.26-M will be applied, except as modified herein to accom-
        modate the special circumstances which pertain to I&S families.
        3.9.2.2. The ETD for LR actions will be compatible with the effective date of all related actions
        required.
            3.9.2.2.1. A new family manager must be registered on all items in the family on or before the
            ETD.
            3.9.2.2.2. S/A SOS changes and I&S data changes must be effective on the ETD.
        3.9.2.3. During the pre-ETD period, the following procedures will apply:
            3.9.2.3.1. For consumable families, the Losing Inventory Manager (LIM) will provide the
            Gaining Inventor Manager (GIM) with required material management information on each
            item in the I&S family on which the LIM has registration.
            3.9.2.3.2. For nonconsumable families to be supported on Phase II basis, the LIM will provide
            the GIM with Requirements Data Exchange Listing (RDEL) and asset status information on
            each item in the I&S family on which the LIM has registration.
AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997                                                                              19


3.10. Item Standardization:
   3.10.1. Policy:
      3.10.1.1. Standardization studies involving items in I&S families will consider, at a minimum, all
      the items in those families.
      3.10.1.2. Standardization decisions can supersede I&S data assignments of items within family
      structures. However, I&S data assignments will not contradict standardization coding assign-
      ments.
      3.10.1.3. Managing S/A will be responsible for restructuring I&S families to reflect standardiza-
      tion decisions for consumable items. For nonconsumable items, the LS PICA will collaborate with
      all registered users via JLC Form 47.
      3.10.1.4. A managing S/A will not be permitted to assign I&S data which designates a nonstand-
      ard item as the master item.
   3.10.2. Procedures:
      3.10.2.1. A managing S/A will provide to using S/A all relevant information in its data base in
      order to facilitate standardization studies. Those studies involving items in I&S families will con-
      sider all the items in those families and, if time and item limitation constraints permit, similar or
      equivalent items outside the family.
      3.10.2.2. Based on standardization study recommendations and decisions for consumable items,
      Item Standardization Code (ISC) assignments will be made which may supersede current I&S data
      assignments. In such cases, the managing S/A will be responsible for restructuring/realigning the
      family to reflect the updated standardization decision.

3.11. Configuration Management:
   3.11.1. Policy:
      3.11.1.1. The managing service will be the coordinating authority for configuration changes
      affecting I&S families under its cognizance. For DLA-managed I&S families, proposed I&S fam-
      ily change will be proposed to the managing DLA center for coordination all recorded users.
      3.11.1.2. The managing service will ensure that Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) Request for
      Waivers (RFW) and Request for Deviations (RFD) as defined in MIL-STD-973 are processed for
      concurrent review and approval/disapproval by the managing and using service. This can be
      accomplished through a Joint Services Configuration Control Board (JSCCB) if required.
      3.11.1.3. Modified configurations of items will be established as I&S replacements for prior bach-
      elor item or master item configurations only when concurrence of the managing and using service
      is obtained. If concurrence is not obtained, modified items may be assigned NSNs and may be
      adopted by one or more concurring service without establishment of I&S relationships. Wholesale
      management assignments for the modified items and the prior configurations will be processed
      according to paragraph 3.4. of this instruction.
      3.11.1.4. When necessary to sustain support of nonconcurring service requirements for the prior
      configuration, the PICAs wholesale support responsibilities will be internally divided and whole-
      sale assets reallocated on an appropriate basis.
20                                                                     AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997


     3.11.2. Procedures:
        3.11.2.1. A managing service will maintain configuration management records for I&S family
        items under its cognizance.
        3.11.2.2. A managing service will coordinate all actions incident to approval of configuration
        changes affecting an I&S family under its cognizance. A using service proposing or introducing a
        configuration change will provide all necessary information and data as required for ECPs by
        MIL-STD-973 to the manager of the I&S family for further coordination.
        3.11.2.3. A managing service will submit proposed configuration changes (ECP) to the organiza-
        tion. In each service, as indicated in the Joint Configuration Management Plan, for review and
        approval.
            3.11.2.3.1. The managing and using service will process proposed configuration changes
            (ECP) according to their internal procedures or Configuration Management Plan for approval/
            disapproval in order to determine a service position with respect to the proposal.
            3.11.2.3.2. Each using service will provide its respective position to the managing service
            according to the Joint Configuration Management Plan for further action.
            3.11.2.3.3. If common agreement cannot be reached with respect to a proposed configuration
            change (ECP), the managing service will convene a JSCCB in accordance with the Joint CM
            Plan to resolve differences with respect to the ECP.
            3.11.2.3.4. Procuring activities should be advised of anticipated ECP disagreements to allow
            for them to make sufficient adjustments to acquisition lead-time to compensate for JSCCB
            actions.
        3.11.2.4. When the managing service and each using service are in agreement with respect to a
        proposed modification, the manager will initiate action, as required, to establish the modified item
        in the I&S family according to the provisions of paragraphs 3.3. and 3.7. The managing service
        will be responsible for acquisition of required modification kits/materiel. Funding of required kits/
        materiel will be accomplished according to AFMCR 400-21/AMC-R 700-99/NAVSUPINST
        4790.7 / MCO 4410.22.
        3.11.2.5. When common agreement cannot be reached with respect to a proposed change, the fol-
        lowing procedures will apply:
            3.11.2.5.1. If the modified item will be other than the master item of an I&S family, the ser-
            vice managing the current bachelor item or family will be assigned as the manager of the mod-
            ified item. Follow- on cataloging actions will be taken according to paragraph 3.7. The
            managing service will be responsible for acquisition of required modification kits/materiel.
            Funding of required kits/materiel will be apportioned between/among those services opting for
            the modification.
            3.11.2.5.2. If the modified item is intended to be a replacement for the current bachelor item
            or family master, no I&S relationship with or to the modified item will be established in view
            of the existing nonconcurrence with respect to the modified item.
               3.11.2.5.2.1. If the service managing the current bachelor item or family opts for the new
               item, that service will be assigned as the manager of the modified item according to the
               provisions of paragraph 3.4.
AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997                                                                                 21


              3.11.2.5.2.2. If the manager will continue to have retail interest in the old bachelor or fam-
              ily item configuration, existing manager/user relations will be maintained on those items.
              3.11.2.5.2.3. If the manager will not continue to have retail interest in the old bachelor or
              old family item configuration, that item and all related I&S items will be reassigned to
              using service which will retain retail interest. In the latter case, the LR action involved will
              reapportion wholesale assets so as to sustain wholesale supply support on the old configu-
              ration, while recognizing the requirement of the manager of the modified item to retain
              assets which can be modified to support projected demands for the modified item.
              3.11.2.5.2.4. If the service managing the current bachelor item or family does not opt for
              the new item, an opting service will be assigned as the manager of the modified item
              according to paragraph 3.4. The assigned manager of the modified item, based on its intent
              to continue or discontinue retail interest on the old bachelor or master item, may initiate
              LR action on existing bachelor item or family according to the provisions of paragraph 3.4.

3.12. Requirements Computation:
   3.12.1. Policy:
      3.12.1.1. Managing and using S/A will compute materiel requirements for items in I&S families
      in a manner which promotes optimum application of related item assets to requirements for the
      family.
      3.12.1.2. Managing S/A will compute wholesale materiel requirements on a subgroup basis con-
      sidering the OOU and JTC values assigned by each using S/A.
      3.12.1.3. Managing S/A will roll up lesser preferred subgroup materiel requirements to the master
      item subgroup for determining net requirements.
   3.12.2. Procedures:
      3.12.2.1. A managing or using S/A will employ the computation methodologies/formulas of its
      respective S/A in the development of materiel requirements projections for I&S families. A man-
      aging S/A will apply its methodologies/formulae on a uniform basis to the requirements experi-
      ence and projections for all using S/A.
      3.12.2.2. A managing S/A will compute wholesale materiel requirements by summing demand
      experience and projections by subgroup, considering the manager's assigned OOU Codes and
      JTC. For subgroups in which manager has no retail interest, the OOU Codes and JTC of the pre-
      dominant using S/A will be considered.
          3.12.2.2.1. During the requirements computation process the PICA of an I&S family will con-
          sider all SICA's Orders of Use, since they may differ from the PICA's. Before finalizing a buy
          requirement all materiel excesses created through PICA subgroup level computations should
          be examined to see if they may satisfy other using services requirements. This will establish a
          new buy requirement to be satisfied through acquisition of the PICA/SICA agreed upon pro-
          curable I&S family master item.
          3.12.2.2.2. Net materiel excesses within the I&S family will be identified by item for disposal
          or materiel returns processing.
22                                                                    AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997


        3.12.2.3. A using S/A will notify the managing S/A of significant deviations in projected materiel
        requirements by providing such notification on the most preferred item in each applicable sub-
        group, in increasing order of preference within its respective family group.
        3.12.2.4. On nonconsumable items supported on a Phase II (NIMSC 5 or 6) basis, annual RDECs
        submitted by a using S/A will be provided only for the most preferred item in each subgroup
        within the submitting S/A family group.

3.13. War Reserve:
     3.13.1. Policy:
        3.13.1.1. Managing and using S/A will compute and subsequently manage war reserve require-
        ments for items in I&S Families in a manner which both promotes optimum application of related
        item assets to the overall war reserve requirements of the family and assures that mobilization
        requirements and planning will be facilitated.
     3.13.2. Procedures:
        3.13.2.1. A managing or using S/A will employ the computation methodologies / formulae of its
        respective S/A in the development of war reserve materiel requirements for I&S families, but will
        coordinate with all users for their anticipated wartime usage. This is to assure that adequate
        requirements will be available to all users during the initial surge caused by war.

3.14. Budgeting and Funding:
     3.14.1. Policy:
        3.14.1.1. Managing S/A will budget and fund for wholesale requirements for I&S items with the
        exception of those coded NIMSC 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 or 9.
            3.14.1.1.1. Net acquisition deficiencies will be expressed on the master item of the family.
            3.14.1.1.2. Net repair deficiencies will be expressed on an item basis, considering the OOU
            values of the managing service.
            3.14.1.1.3. Inapplicable/excess assets will be identified on an item basis, considering require-
            ments of the associated subgroup.
        3.14.1.2. Managing and using S/A will budget and fund for their respective retail requirements.
            3.14.1.2.1. Net acquisition deficiencies will be expressed on the master item of the family.
            3.14.1.2.2. Inapplicable/excess assets will be identified on an item basis, considering require-
            ments of the associated subgroup in the respective S/A family group.
     3.14.2. Procedures:
        3.14.2.1. These policies will be executed within managing and using S/A respective stratification
        and budget submission processes.

AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997                                                                             23


     3.15.1.1. The provisions of this paragraph apply to consumable items and NIMSC 5 nonconsum-
     able items. Requisition processing policy for the balance of nonconsumable items is contained in
     AFMCR400-21/AMC-R-700-99/NAVSUPINST 4790.7/MCO P4410.22.
     3.15.1.2. Requisitions for materiel will be prepared and submitted according to Military Standard
     Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) and Defense Automated Addressing System
     (DAAS) procedures.
     3.15.1.3. In order to promote use of related item assets, managing and using S/A will promulgate
     requisitioning procedures which encourage field activities to requisition the least preferred accept-
     able items within their respective S/A family group.
     3.15.1.4. Managing S/A will process using S/A requisitions according to the recorded I&S data of
     the requisitioning service. Managing S/A will not issue to a requisitioning service materiel which
     is other than unconditionally acceptable without the approval or consent of the requisitioner.
     3.15.1.5. In order to progressively attrite related item assets, managing and using S/A will modify
     their requisition processing procedures to afford original issue consideration to the least preferred
     items within the subgroup of the item requisitioned.
     3.15.1.6. Managing S/A will modify their requisition processing procedures so as to record and
     maintain records of customer demand on the item requisitioned.
  3.15.2. Procedures:
     3.15.2.1. A managing S/A will record and maintain a history of demand on the item requisitioned
     and also identify that demand by requisitioning S/A .
     3.15.2.2. For nonconsumables supported on a Phase II (NIMSC 5 only) basis, a referring SICA
     ICP will forward field activity requisitions to the PICA citing the NSN originally requisitioned.
     Irrespective of any intervening SICA consideration of more preferred items in its family group.
     NIMSC 6 requisitions will go directly to the PICA from the requisitioner.
     3.15.2.3. A managing S/A will process using S/A requisitions according to the I&S data recorded
     for the requisitioning S/A.
         3.15.2.3.1. A managing S/A will afford original issue consideration to the least preferred item
         in the requisitioning S/A subgroup to which the item is assigned. Progressive issue consider-
         ation will be afforded according to the OOU and JTC values assigned by the requisitioning S/
         A.
         3.15.2.3.2. Generic items will be afforded issue consideration in random sequence but must
         comply with established requisitioning S/A OOU/JTC codes.
         3.15.2.3.3. When requisitioner restrictive MILSTRIP advice coding (for example, Advice
         code 2B) precludes issue consideration of other items in the family and the requisition is for an
         item other than the master item or a generic item, the managing S/A will reject the requisition
         if the requested item is neither available for issue nor procurable.
         3.15.2.3.4. When family assets, including the master item, are not available for issue, whole-
         sale backorders will be established against the original item requisitioned in order to obtain
         full issue capability in subsequent backorder release processing.
24                                                                    AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997


            3.15.2.3.5. Appropriate MILSTRIP status notification will be provided according to assigned
            Media and Status Codes and/or Distribution Codes when requisition processing results in an
            issue or a backorder against an item other than the item originally requisitioned.

3.16. Priority Application of Assets:
     3.16.1. Policy:
        3.16.1.1. A managing S/A will satisfy requisitions for I&S items from available wholesale stocks
        without regard to the S/A affiliation of the requisitioning activity.
        3.16.1.2. A managing S/A will establish appropriate control levels and quantitative issue restric-
        tions within I&S families.
        3.16.1.3. A managing S/A will apply maximum release quantity or other quantitative validations
        on an equal basis for all using S/A.
     3.16.2. Procedures:
        3.16.2.1. A managing S/A will process the requisitions of all S/A according to Uniform Materiel
        Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS) Issue Priority Designators (IPD).
            3.16.2.1.1. Requisitions will be satisfied in the sequence specified by MILSTRIP.
            3.16.2.1.2. A managing service will consider the same depth of wholesale assets for equiva-
            lent requisitions irrespective of requisitioning S/A.
        3.16.2.2. A managing S/A will compute and apply maximum release quantities or other quantita-
        tive validations, such as allowance checks, on an equal basis for all customers.
            3.16.2.2.1. Quantitative validations will be applied so as to avoid progressive partial rejec-
            tions of customer requisitions when progressively preferred items in the family are considered
            for issue.
            3.16.2.2.2. Quantitative validation checks will be applied uniformly within a given subgroup;
            quantitative validation checks in different subgroups either may be applied uniformly or may
            be bypassed upon completion of the check on the item originally requisitioned, at the option of
            the managing S/A.

     3.17.1. Policy:
        3.17.1.1. A managing S/A will apply their respective S/A policies for designating I&S families as
        critical. Using S/A recommendations to designate a family as critical will be considered.
        3.17.1.2. A managing S/A may request extended asset visibility for critical I&S families from
        using S/A.
        3.17.1.3. A managing S/A will ensure that scarce wholesale assets of critical families are centrally
        controlled and are equitably apportioned among all using S/A.
     3.17.2. Procedures:
AFMCI20-101 15 AUGUST 1997                                                                             25


      3.17.2.1. A managing S/A may designate a family as critical when family assets are in short sup-
      ply or are expected to be in short supply for an extended period. The designation will be commu-
      nicated to all using S/A.
      3.17.2.2. When unable to satisfy requisitions for items in a critical family, a managing S/A will
      offer assets to the ICP using service for review.
          3.17.2.2.1. Such offers may apply to items in less preferred subgroups than the item requisi-
          tioned or may apply to items which are considered as related items only by another using S/A.
          3.17.2.2.2. In no case will issues of such items be made without the approval of the requisi-
          tioning activity.
      3.17.2.3. When a managing S/A deems it advantageous to a critical supply situation, extended
      visibility of using S/A retail assets may be requested.
          3.17.2.3.1. When the cited provisions are invoked, they may apply to all members of the I&S
          family.
          3.17.2.3.2. In order to assess the need for transaction versus cyclic visibility of using S/A
          assets, a composite item grouping designator will be established for the family.
          3.17.2.3.3. A managing S/A will restrict referrals against using S/A retail assets to other than
          routine requirements.

     the provisions of DoD 4140.32-M.
     3.22.1.2. When a managing S/A I&S Master Item is identified for Defense Inactive Item Program
     (DIIP) review, all related items will also be automatically referred for review. A master item will
     not be referred for review under the DIIP if there is any demand on the related items. The demand
     on the related NSNs will ultimately be applied to the master item. Related items with assets will
     not be referred if there is demand on less preferred items for which the assets of the inactive
     related item may be issued. Related items identified as potentially inactive will be referred for
     DIIP review independently of the master item.

         management responsibilities for the family to another using service is accomplished.
         3.22.2.1.3. When a using service withdraws from a related item peculiar to that service, the
         managing S/A will delete the item from the family
     3.22.2.2. A managing or using service may withdraw retail interest on I&S items based on past
     and projected future inactivity. The provisions of paragraph 3.22.2.1. apply to such withdrawals as
     well. A managing or using S/A will not withdraw from an I&S item solely based on inactivity if a
     less preferred I&S item is still active.
     3.22.2.3. A managing S/A may not delete an item of supply in an I&S family without the concur-
     rence of all using services.

of equipment, code "E" as a depot reparable component; code "R' as a consumable, and code "U" special
technique is applied.
Master Item—The item in an I&S family which is commonly regarded by the managing and using
services/agencies as a suitable substitute for all other items in the family and as the preferred item for
acquisition purposes. Within a family headed by a generic subgroup, the generic NSN is always
designated as the master item.
Nonconsumable Items—Items of supply which are major end items (principal and secondary), depot
reparable components, special management, or inconsistent items.

higher order of preference for use than that accorded to another similar item of supply.
Primary Inventory Control Activity (PICA)—The service/agency designated as the single activity
responsible for providing materiel support on both consumable and nonconsumable items. The degree of
materiel support is identified by the level of authority assigned.
Related Item—An item of supply which has functional or physical characteristics which render it a lower
order of preference for use than that accorded to the master item of an I&S family.

Secondary Inventory Control Activity (SICA)—The military service receiving both consumable and
nonconsumable item materiel support from the PICA for selected logistics functions. The degree of
materiel support is identified by the level of authority assigned.
Sequence Code—A single digit code which specifies the ascending order of preference between/among
interchangeable items within a subgroup.
Subgroup—A range of items within a family group which are interchangeable with each other. Items
which have no interchangeable relationship with any other item are the sole members of their subgroups.
Items which are not interchangeable are assigned different subgroup code values.
Subgroup Code—A two-digit code which either relates interchangeable items or differentiates between
items which are not interchangeable.
Substitutable Item—An item which possesses such functional and physical characteristics as to be
capable of being exchanged for another only under specified conditions or for particular applications and
without alteration of the items themselves or of adjoining items. This term is synonymous with the phrase
"one way interchangeability," such as item B can be interchanged in all applications for item A, but item
A cannot be used in all applications requiring item B.
