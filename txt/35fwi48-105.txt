Establishes policies and procedures governing the implementation of 35FWI 48-105, Prevention
of Thermal Stress. Provides guidance for commanders and supervisors to prevent heat and cold
stress related injuries at Misawa AB, Japan. This instruction takes into account that heavy winter
clothing is available and worn by personnel who are subject to working outdoors. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
Additionally, if the publication generates a report(s), alert readers in a statement and cite all
applicable Reports Control Numbers in accordance with AFI 33-324. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from
the field through the appropriate functional chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been substantially revised to incorporate changes in the governing AFPAM
48-151, Thermal Stress.       In accordance with Air Force Guidance Memorandum 2,
responsibilities for providing frostbite risk information have been added. Tables from the
guidance memorandum have been incorporated as Tables 5 and 6 in this instruction.

1. HEAT STRESS RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES
1.1. 35 AMDS/SGPB, Bioenvironmental Engineering will:
        1.1.1. Ensure heat stress guidance is available to shop personnel through Air Force
        Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) inspections at the shop level.
        1.1.2. Ensure the WBGT instrument is calibrated and available for daily use from 1 June
        to 1 October. The WBGT instrument will be deployed during normal duty hours Monday
        through Friday when the ambient temperature is forecast to reach or exceed 80°F.
        1.1.3. Determine the heat category and flag color in accordance with Tables 1-4 every
        two hours and report this information to the 35 FW Command Post as changes occur.
        Because the available guidance was developed according to the wear of the hot weather
        BDU, one degree will be added to the WBGT reading at all times to account for ABU
        wear. Exercise heat stress information should provide the heat categories for non-players
        and these different MOPP levels simultaneously.
     1.2. 35 FW/CP, Command Post will relay the heat category and flag color to 35 FW
     organizational commanders through appropriate means for Misawa AB dissemination, such
     as phone, commander’s access channel, and/or the commander's radio net.
     1.3. 35 FW Organizational Commanders will:
        1.3.1. Ensure that heat stress programs are implemented throughout their organizations.
        1.3.2. Relay the heat category and flag color to their respective squadrons down to the
        shop supervisors.
     1.4. Shop supervisors will:
        1.4.1. Implement heat stress guidance at the shop level per Tables 1 and 2 below.
        1.4.2. Brief personnel during late spring and summer months on heat stress in safety
        meetings and follow the guidance provided.

2. COLD STRESS RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES
   2.1. 35 AMDS/SGPB, Bioenvironmental Engineering will:
      2.1.1. Ensure wind chill guidance is provided to shop personnel through AFOSH
      inspections at the shop level.
      2.1.2. During winter months, review wind chill forecasts at the beginning and end of the
      duty day, Monday through Friday. The frostbite risk and appropriate precautions will be
      determined in accordance with Tables 5 and 6 and reported to the 35 FW Command Post
      as changes occur.

    2.2. 35 FW/CP, Command Post will relay the frostbite risk to 35 FW organizational
    commanders through appropriate means for Misawa AB dissemination, such as phone,
    commander’s access channel, and/or the commander's radio net.
    2.3. 35 OSS/OSW, Weather will provide wind chill forecasts via the weather channel. The
    forecast is also available via Sharepoint at the following link if the weather channel is
    unavailable. https://misawa.eim.pacaf.af.mil/sites/35TH%20OSS%20WEATHER%20F
    LIGHT/Weather%20Information/Forms/AllItems.aspx
    2.4. FW Organizational Commanders will:

       when the ambient temperature is 30°F or less.
       2.5.4. If heavy work is done (shoveling, etc.) encourage workers to change into dry
       clothing prior to re-entering a cold environment or going into a cold environment.
       2.5.5. Ensure workers handling evaporative liquids such as gasoline, alcohol or cleaning
       fluids at temperatures below 40°F take special precautions to avoid soaking clothes or
       gloves due to evaporative cooling of the liquids.
       2.5.6. Brief shop personnel during fall and winter safety meetings on wind chill factors
       and follow the guidance provided.
       2.5.7. If a worker becomes immersed in water or their clothing becomes wet, encourage
       him/her to change clothing immediately and seek treatment for hypothermia.
