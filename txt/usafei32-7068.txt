This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 32-70, Environmental Quality, and Annex L,
Environmental Considerations, to the European Command (EUCOM) Operations Plan. This instruction
defines the responsibilities and procedures for performing an Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS) in
conjunction with pre- and post-deployment operations. This instruction applies to all United States Air
Force in Europe (USAFE) units, personnel and resources involved in overseas, operational and training
deployments over 30 days. This instruction applies to the extent it does not either conflict with require-
ments imposed by international agreements or cause degradation to mission capability. The EBS does not
directly address the health hazards that may result from environmental conditions. Bioenvironmental
engineering personnel will address health hazard risk assessment as a part of their environmental health
site assessment (EHSA). The EHSA may be referenced in the EBS as appropriate. Coordination with host
nation personnel may be required. Send recommendations for changes or improvements to this instruction
on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to the Environmental Division (HQ
USAFE/A7CV), Unit 3050, Box 10, APO AE 09094-5010.

1. General Information. The purpose for conducting an Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS) for
deployed operations is to (1) identify any potential health hazards and environmental concerns with the
property; (2) document the environmental condition of the property before and after deployment; and (3)
record environmental damages (if any) as a result of the deployment. This instruction outlines the proce-
dures for identifying and recording sensitive and or protected natural and cultural resources (protected
plants, animals, archeological or historical sites), and contaminated sites either existing before deploy-
ment or occurring during deployment operations. This information will be used to protect sensitive envi-
ronmental areas from deployment operations. It will also alert deployed personnel to contaminated sites
and facilitate beddown planning.

2. Objectives:
   2.1. Document the environmental condition of the property with field notes, facility checklists, maps
   and photographs.
   2.2. Identify pre-existing hazardous substances, contaminated sites, and any natural or cultural
   resources.
   2.3. Identify post-deployment environmental conditions.

3. Responsibilities:
   3.1. HQ USAFE/A7CV:
       3.1.1. Provides execution guidance and oversees implementation of this instruction for the
       USAFE area of responsibility (AOR).
       3.1.2. Reviews pre- and post-deployment EBS when there is no supporting main operating base
       (MOB), Numbered AF or Environmental Planning Function (EPF) (some deployment locations
       are not supported by MOB or EPF).
       3.1.3. Maintains copies of pre- and post-deployment EBSs for those deployment locations not
       supported by Numbered AF, MOB or EPF.
   3.2. Numbered AF, MOB or EPF:
       3.2.1. Prepares and completes the AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis.
       3.2.2. Reviews pre- and post-deployment EBS for those deployed locations supported within their
       AOR.
       3.2.3. Maintains copies of pre- and post-deployment EBSs for those deployed locations supported
       within their AOR.
   3.3. Deployed Unit. The deployment commander shall designate an environmental coordinator to
   complete the EBS and provide the name, rank and contact information of the environmental coordina-
   tor to HQ USAFE/A7CV, Numbered AF, MOB, and EPF.
   3.4. Deployed Unit Environmental Coordinator:
       3.4.1. Prior to deployment, the environmental coordinator should review available site maps,
       building plans and environmental guidance concerning the deployed location for potential envi-
       ronmental concerns and sensitive natural and cultural resources.
4                                                                    USAFEI32-7068 16 MARCH 2004


       3.4.2. Qualitative data collected during the pre-deployment survey should be used to establish a
       soil, air and water sampling strategy. The strategy should be coordinated with the Bioenvironmen-
       tal Engineer (BEE) to ensure sampling is not duplicated for health and environmental purposes;
       sampling may very well serve both purposes. The BEE will collect samples in support of the EBS.
       Quantitative data collected as part of this sampling strategy will be essential for defining potential
       environmental concerns prior to deployment of forces. Data from this preliminary survey should
       be provided to the BEE, who will perform a health risk assessment. These proactive steps will
       ensure necessary environmental controls are in place prior to deployment of personnel. The
       deployed location site map should be overlaid with a grid that matches the Civil Engineer Readi-
       ness Division (CEX) Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Explosive (CBRNE)/force pro-
       tection zones. In the event of a CBRNE event, the data obtained from Vapor Liquid Solid (VLS)
       Track and subsequent quantification efforts could be tied clearly into the overall post-deployment
       EBS report.
       3.4.3. Completes a deployment EBS report (attachment 1 through attachment 4) not later than
       (NLT) 15 days after the initial beddown and a post-deployment EBS no earlier than 30 days prior
       to redeployment. Submits an electronic (preferable) or hard copy of both the pre-and post-deploy-
       ment EBS to the associated MOB EPF, Numbered AF and HQ USAFE/A7CV, whichever is
       appropriate.
       3.4.4. A post-deployment soil, air and water sampling strategy should be developed as part of the
       post-deployment EBS. Data obtained from this sampling strategy should be used to quantify the
       environmental impact at the deployed location of our forces.

4. EBS Report. The procedure for conducting the EBS has been simplified so that even an individual
with little environmental experience can complete the documentation. The report identifies and evaluates
the level of contamination at deployed locations. The EBS report template is at Attachment 2. The report
requires items listed in the table of contents (Figure A2.2) to be completed along with photographs or
maps that give a clear picture of the environmental condition of the property and a list of contacts while
conducting the EBS.
    4.1. EBS Data. The EBS data collection items are used to assess and determine the impact that oper-
    ations have on the environment during operational and training deployments. They serve as snapshots
    of the environmental condition of the subject property before and after deployment. Emphasis is
    placed on visual and physical site inspections, collection of local environmental records (if available)
    and interviews of current or former employees involved in operations conducted on the site (such as
    host airport authorities, landowners and other personnel familiar with the site). It is important to note
    both the condition of and the presence of any odors, stains, corrosion, stressed vegetation, and dead or
    diseased plants or wildlife at locations where hazardous substance storage, release and disposal has or
    is likely to have occurred. Any containers appearing to be abandoned or leaking must be noted. Pho-
    tographs and Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of all areas of concern are encouraged for
    documentation of existing conditions. The EBS report must clearly identify if a condition existed prior
    to US presence or if the condition is a result of US forces at the location.
       4.1.1. Environmental Conditions. This is the main part of the EBS report. A list of environmental
       areas of concern is provided in items A3.5.1 through A3.5.13. The purpose of this step is for the
       environmental coordinator to become familiar with the site by conducting a walk-through and
       recording any observations. For each item, the template provides (in the brackets) some basic
USAFEI32-7068 16 MARCH 2004                                                                               5


     questions to ask or the type of data to include. This guidance is provided to help with the data col-
     lection and should not be considered all-inclusive. Emphasis is placed on the following:
        4.1.1.1. Hazardous Materials and Wastes. Materials such as solvents, cleaners, paints,
        degreasers, pesticides and other chemical products stored in drums, cans, buckets, or other
        containers, are to be evaluated.
        4.1.1.2. Petroleum Substances. Materials and wastes such as fuels, oils, lubricants, hydraulic
        fluids, mineral spirits and other solvents that are petroleum based.
        4.1.1.3. Natural and Cultural Resources. Threatened and endangered species (T&ES), wet-
        lands, cultural, historical, archeological and natural conditions of the subject property are to be
        addressed. For the purpose of this instruction, the environmental coordinator is to document,
        to the best of his or her abilities, all visible signs of wildlife and any areas of standing or run-
        ning water. Unusual vegetation should also be noted. Contact HQ USAFE/A7CVP to request
        reference materials and additional guidance.
     4.1.2. Facility Assessment Checklist (attachment 4). The environmental coordinator shall conduct
     an inspection of any facilities used by the deploying forces. The purpose of the inspection is to
     determine or discover whether any hazardous substance that represents a concern to human health
     or the environment in or around the facility has been released in the past or could potentially be
     released in the future. Inspect the interior and exterior of the subject property including buildings,
     structures, equipment, pipelines or other improvements. Document any concerns as referenced in
     the checklist and complete a Facility Assessment Checklist (Attachment 4) for each facility
     inspected. Coordination with Intel may be required to gather information on adjacent facilities not
     used by the deploying forces to assess the full spectrum of environmental conditions.
     4.1.3. Summary of Environmental Conditions (Attachment 5). The environmental coordinator
     must analyze the environmental condition of the subject property, in order to determine the degree
     of contamination present. The analysis is done by applying the Environmental Condition Codes to
     the information gathered in Attachment 3, item A3.5 and Attachment 4. The codes can be found in
     4.1.3.1 below and in the form in Attachment 5 (Summary of Environmental Conditions). The
     analysis is documented on the Summary of Environmental Conditions form. Areas of concern
     should become clear after reviewing the form. The environmental coordinator should also docu-
     ment any required follow-up actions to fully define the environmental condition of the property.
        4.1.3.1. Environmental Condition Codes:
6                                                                USAFEI32-7068 16 MARCH 2004


Table 1. Environmental Condition Codes. Use Table 1 when completing Attachment 5.
Category 1   No environmental contamination/degradation noted. No storage, release or disposal
             of hazardous substances or petroleum-based products has occurred.
Category 2   Hazardous substances or petroleum-based products are present or have been present
             in the past.
Category 3   Contamination and or degradation possible. Release, disposal and, or migration of
             hazardous substances or petroleum-based products have occurred. Remedial actions
             might be required. Coordinate any contamination with the Bio-Environmental Engi-
             neer (BEE).
Category 4   Further evaluation required. Visual examination and record review not sufficient to
             allow condition code determination. Note additional requirements and contact the
             MOB, Numbered AF, HQ USAFE/A7CV or the BEE.
Category 5   Pre-existing condition.

         4.1.3.2. Survey Certification (Attachment 6). The EBS deployment report must contain a cer-
         tification regarding the accuracy of the EBS. The deployed commander and the environmental
         coordinator should sign the certification. The deploying unit should keep the EBS documenta-
         tion for 5 years. HQ USAFE/A7CVP should keep the documentation for 10 years.

                               ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE SURVEY

A3.1. Purpose of EBS. We conducted an Environmental Baseline Survey at__XXXXX__ to assess the
existing environmental condition of the site and appraise the potential for environmental contamination at
the site. The EBS (1) identifies any potential environmental concerns with the property; (2) documents the
environmental condition of the property being used for deployment; (3) records environmental damages
(if any); and (4) serves as a record for post-deployment environmental actions. The survey focuses on
determining the presence of hazardous substances (which includes both materials and hazardous wastes)
and petroleum products and their wastes. The survey also serves to identify releases, past releases or
sources for potential releases of any of these substances to the ground, groundwater or surface waters at
the site. It will also alert deployed personnel to areas of existing contamination prior to arrival on site.

A3.2. Survey Methodology. In order to determine the potential for existing and future site contamina-
tion, we performed a walk-through inspection and conducted personal interviews. If contamination was
observed, the survey team noted its location and tried to characterize its type. The inspection and inter-
views provided a snapshot of the environmental condition of the subject property prior to deployment.
Emphasis was placed on visual and physical site inspections of the subject property, the collection of local
environmental records (if available) and interviewing current or former employees involved in operations
conducted on the site (such as host airport authorities, landowners and other personnel familiar with the
site). It is important to note both the condition of and the presence of odors, stains, corrosion, stressed
vegetation, and dead or diseased plants or wildlife at locations where hazardous substance storage, release
and disposal has occurred or is likely to have occurred. These conditions were (whenever possible) noted
on photographs or maps of the site.

A3.3. Site History and Current Use. Talk to host nation personnel (if possible) about past use of site
(previous beddowns, landfills, hazardous material storage or hazardous/sludge disposal, etc). Try to find
out what types of chemicals/materials were spilled/disposed of on the site.
