Sheppard Air Force Base and to permit safe mission accomplishment. This implements AFI 32-
1002, Snow and Ice Control, and it applies to all base agencies. Tasked organizations are
responsible for checking their portion of this instruction. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure all records created as a result of

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. 82 CES/DS2
responsibilities have been defined in para 2. Paragraphs 6.1, 6.4 and 6.5 of the previous version
were removed and LRS responsibilities have been modified. The priority list, Attachment 1, has
been updated to denote more current priorities. An asterisk “*”indicates changes from the
previous edition.

Section A—Responsibilities

1. 82 TRW/CC is the sole authority for deviations to the pre-established priorities outlined
at Attachment 1. 82 TRW/CC shall define the appropriate snow and ice control priorities based

upon the inclement weather scenario training schedule, and input from group commanders to
include the 80 FTW Operations Group Commander as necessary.
2. Civil Engineer Squadron (82 CES/DS2) will:
     2.1. Activate a snow control center in building 1404 (extension 6-5155), when Snow and Ice
     accumulation is forecast. The snow control center will be the DS2 focal point for executing
     operations. Upon activation of any operations, the snow control center will contact DS2’s
     24-hour Energy Management Control System (EMCS) operator, extension 6-4502, with
     current road conditions and actions underway. The on-duty EMCS operator will call
     command post upon initiation and provide periodic updates, as received from the snow
     control center shift supervisor.
     2.2. Accomplish snow and ice removal operations on the airfield and base pavements IAW
     priorities outlined in Attachment 1, unless directed to deviate by 82 TRW/CC. NOTE: Only
     those areas necessary for mission accomplishment will be cleared. Sand will not be applied
     to airfield pavements. Snow/ice control equipment may be operated within 25 ft of an
     aircraft, yet no closer than 10 ft as long as a spotter is present. If a spotter is not present,
     snow/ice control equipment shall not be operated within 25 ft of aircraft. (IAW SAFBI 13-
     213, Vehicle Operations on the Airfield.)
     2.3. Maintain a squadron operating instruction (OI) listing snow removal procedures and
     available equipment and supplies. Establish a summer rehabilitation program for snow/ice
     control equipment.
     2.4. Notify 80 OSS/DO/OSA when Snow and Ice Control operations will start or continue
     on airfield pavements before or after normal tower operations.
     2.5. Store and inspect seasonal equipment not in possession of Vehicle Management every
     month during off-season months, using the applicable Operator’s Inspection Guide and
     Trouble Report. Fully operationally check motorized equipment during this inspection.

        OSS/OSAA (Airfield Management), notify the 82 TRW/CC and snow control center of
        deviations from established priorities on the airfield to meet operational needs.
        3.1.2. Provide appropriate manning of control tower to adequately identify runway and
        snow removal operations on the airfield when requested by the snow control center.
        Snow/Ice control can be accomplished on taxiways but will not occur on the runways if
        the tower is closed.
     3.2. The FTW Aircraft Maintenance Contractor will.
        3.2.1. Provide a POC to the snow control center (extension 6-5155) for
        equipment/aircraft removal and snow/ice control on the 80 FTW parking apron/ENJJPT
        Ramp/flight line.
        3.2.2. Notify Maintenance Operations Center, extension 6-2936, to coordinate
        requirements ensuring that ENJJPT Ramp flight line areas to be cleared of snow/ice are
        prepared as follows:

      3.2.3. Remove all tools, stands, fire extinguishers, unused wheel chock, and other
      removable items from parking ramps to designated area not in use.
      3.2.4. Remove snow from aircraft and clear paved surfaces to a 25-foot distance from
      aircraft to allow safe operation of snow and ice control equipment.
      3.2.5. When feasible, remove aircraft from areas to be cleared.

      operation on the airfield.
      3.3.3. Coordinate with 80 OG/CC/CD and 80 OSS/DO for airfield priorities.
      3.3.4. Will provide a list of POC’s to contact when Snow and Ice Control operations will

   4.2. Enforce notices posted by the Snow Control Office, 82 CES Heavy Repair
   Superintendent, pertaining to restrictive parking and movement of grounds vehicles in on-
   street and common-use (Commissary, Base Exchange, etc.) areas, where snow removal
   operations are scheduled or being conducted.
   4.3. Post color-coded (red, green, yellow) road condition signs at each entry gate.
