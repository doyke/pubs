8                                                  AFI36-2820_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JULY 2012


       an adequate opportunity to participate in this program. Supervisors’ continuous support is
       essential to the program’s success.
    2.3. Suspense: Each Air Force MAJCOM, FOA, unified and combined command, and DoD
    joint agency planning to submit packages will provide a POC to AF ISR Agency POCs, not
    later than the first Friday of December of each year. Nomination packages that compete at
    the AF-Level will be forwarded to AF ISR Agency not later than the last Friday of February
    of each year. (Note: Air Force MAJCOM, FOA, Unified and Combined Command, and
    DoD Joint Agencies will set their own suspense for packages competing below the AF-
    Level). All packages must include the following.
       2.3.1. Memo of Transmittal. Only one memo is required for each MAJCOM/COCOM
       for the entire set of nomination packages as outlined in Attachment 2.
           2.3.1.1. Memo of Transmittal will confirm that all military nominees meet AF
           standards for fitness and conduct and that all packages have been through a security
           review.
           2.3.1.2. Memo of Transmittal will identify which system (NIPR, SIPR or JIWCs)
           each Nomination Form is being submitted through (as reflected in Attachment 2). If
           all nominations are being sent via one system, an overall statement may be made on
           the Memo of Transmittal instead of identifying a system per nomination.
       2.3.2. Nomination Form. Award nomination will be submitted on an AF Form 1206,
       Nomination for Award.
           2.3.2.1. The ―Award‖ field on the top of the AF Form 1206 will reflect the specific
           award name as outlined in this AFI. Acronyms are allowed. The Category field will
           show the individual award level as outlined in paragraph 1.2 of this Instruction.
           2.3.2.2. Limit the award nomination narrative to 31 typed, single spaced lines only,
           including the heading ―Outstanding Leadership and Performance‖ (Outstanding Unit
           Performance, for unit awards). Use bullet format with 12 pitch, Times New Roman
           font. Reference award criteria set out in the description of each award in this AFI (do
           not include community service and professional military or other education
           accomplishments).
           2.3.2.3. Use of acronyms is permitted. All acronyms need to be spelled out on the
           AF Form 1206 continuation page.
           2.3.2.4. Nominations may be classified up to TS/SI/TK. Collateral classified
           packages must follow proper classification guidelines according to DoD 5200.1-R,
           Information Security Program Regulation, AFI 31-401, Information Security
           Program Management. SCI packages must follow the appropriate guidelines
           provided in DoD 5105.21-M-1 and ICD 710. All classified nomination forms (AF
           Form 1206) must have overall classification markings at the top and bottom of the
           specific accomplishments section, along with typed portion markings at the beginning
           of each bulleted line showing the classification of each bulleted line.
       2.3.3. MAJCOM/COCOM POCs will post all packages to secure web sites on either
       NIPR or JWICS not later than the last Friday in February.
AFI36-2820_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JULY 2012                                                           9

CATEGORY_LEVEL_ACTIVE/ARC_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_MAJCOM.
EXAMPLE: NCO_II_AD_DOE_JANE_USAFE
         2.3.3.2. Any/all desired SIPR submissions will be pre-coordinated with AF ISR
         Agency.
         2.3.3.3. A detailed message of instruction for both the NIPR CoP and JWICs
         Sharepoint sites will be provided to all POCs not later than the second Friday in
         January.
3. SELECTION PROCESS.
  3.1. AF/A2, with the administrative support of AF ISR Agency, will convene three boards in
  the Spring of each year to select AF-Level winners from submissions. Boards will be held to
  evaluate the nomination packages and make final recommendations for DCS-ISR approval.
  Two nonvoting recorders from AF ISR Agency staff will provide administrative and
  technical assistance to the boards.
     3.1.1. Officer/Civilian Board: chaired by the 14N Career Field Manager (CFM) and
     comprised of three additional colonels (two AD and one ARC) and one senior level
     civilian (DCIPS Band 5). The board will review and select a winner from all individual
     officer and civilian categories. This board will also select a nominee from the unit award
     packages for each unit award and an AD and ARC nominee to compete for the Maj Gen
     Jack E. Thomas NMIA awards.
     3.1.2. Enlisted Board: chaired by the ISR CFM and comprised of four additional chief
     master sergeants (three AD and one ARC). The board will review and select a winner
     from all individual enlisted categories. This board will also select a nominee from the
     unit award packages for each unit award and an AD and ARC nominee to compete for the
     Maj Gen Jack E. Thomas NMIA awards.
     3.1.3. Combined Board: chaired by the 14N CFM and comprised of the Enlisted ISR
     CFM and an additional colonel. The board will review and select a winner from the
     Officer/Civilian Board and Enlisted Board nominations for the unit awards and Maj Gen
     Jack E. Thomas NMIA awards.
     3.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) A selection board is convened for all awards. Board member
     representation is determined by the award program (i.e., the board member should be
     familiar with the award category/program) and normally consists of four members, from
     across directorate lines. The grade of the board members will be, at a minimum; a senior
     officer (O-5 to O-6) as the board president and a second officer (O-4 to O-6) for officer
     award programs. The AFGSC/A2 senior enlisted leader will appoint the appropriate
     number of Noncommissioned Officers (NCOs) as board members for enlisted award
     programs. AFGSC/A2X Functional Area Manager (FAM) Office will appoint civilians in
     the grades of GS-12 (or equivalent) or above for civilian award programs. AFGSC wings
     may elect to convene wing-level awards boards to consider nomination packages. Wing
     commanders or their designated representative will approve board selections before they
 10                                                AFI36-2820_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JULY 2012


       are forwarded to NAFs for review. NAFs may elect to bypass the review process if their
       wings have convened boards. In that case, NAFs may submit individual wing and/or unit
       nominations directly to HQ AFGSC/A2X.
       3.1.5. (Added-AFGSC) Upon review and selection of award packages by the board
       members, selected nomination packages are returned to the originator for any required
       fine-tuning.
          3.1.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) The AFGSC/A2X FAM Office will ensure nomination
          packages are in the correct format and complete.
          3.1.5.2. (Added-AFGSC) The board president recommends approval of the selected
          nomination packages to the AFGSC/A2 or Senior Intelligence Officer for Air Force
          ISR Awards Program (AFISRAP).
          3.1.5.3. (Added-AFGSC) Upon AFGSC/A2 approval, AFGSC/A2X FAM Office
          forwards the nomination packages to the appropriate service/agency.
   3.2. The DCS-ISR will announce all winners through the DMS via official message not later
   than the first Friday in April each year. Detailed AFISRAP Awards Activities/Banquet
   information will be provided in this message.
   3.3. Within two weeks of the official AFISRAP winner announcement, the submitting
   authority for each winner, including unit winners, will forward an UNCLASSIFIED
   biography, an UNCLASSIFIED citation, and an official color photo (head and shoulders), in
   format, to AF/A2D. The official AFISRAP announcement will provide specific submission
   details.
       3.3.1. Biography will be drafted using single-space for the narrative portion and double-
       space between name, SSN, and AFSC (reference AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies and
       Awards for format and attachment 3 of AFI 36-2820).
       3.3.2. Citation for award presentation at the official ceremony will be drafted and limited
       to 50-70 key words (not including opening and closing statements), which succinctly
       describes the nominee’s accomplishments (reference AFI 36-2805 for format and
       attachment 4 of AFI 36-2820).

Staff Sergeant John Q. Doe is an Intelligence Specialist assigned to the 12th Air Intelligence
Squadron, Bergstrom AFB, Texas. He is 26 years old. Sergeant Doe was born in Lexington,
Kentucky, on 1 March 1967. He attended Henry Clay High School and excelled across the entire

Bergstrom AFB, where he began on-the-job training for his five-skill level. Sergeant Doe
married in 1990, and both he and his wife actively participate in the local church where he serves
as youth counselor. He was the Outstanding Airman of the Quarter, and subsequently for the
year in 1990, for the 123rd Combat Support Group. He is the recipient of the Air Force

                          MAJOR JOHN D DOE


Major John D. Doe distinguished himself as Intelligence Flight Commander, XXth Operations
Support Squadron, XXth Operations Group, XXth Airlift Wing, United States Air Forces in
Europe, Unknown Air Base, Lowenbrau from Day Month Year to Day Month Year. During this
period, Major Doe’s expert leadership of his flight during the Month Year Operational Readiness
Exercise resulted in an ―Excellent‖ rating for his flight. Additionally, he successfully increased
his flight’s manning during a period of Air Force directed cutbacks. Furthermore, Major Doe
merged his training programs with external XXth Airlift Wing intelligence organizations
strengthening the battlefield skills of his Airmen for non-traditional deployments supporting
combat operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, Maj Doe deployed as detachment
chief, Overseas Contingency Operations Area, Some Village in Afghanistan, from Day Month
Year to Day Month Year. While deployed, he was responsible for regional document
exploitation operations in support of United States and coalition forces in support of operation
ENDURING FREEDOM and the International Security Assistance Force. He trained numerous
coalition and US Special Forces on the Defense Intelligence Agency’s doctrine for removing
captured enemy documents from the battlefield solidly increasing collection opportunities
throughout the country and resulting in Major Doe being awarded two foreign medals. The
singularly distinctive accomplishments of Major Doe reflect credit upon himself and the United
States Air Force.
