                                            Chapter 1

                                    GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Purpose of Conducting Test and Evaluation (T&E). The primary functions of T&E are
to determine if systems are effective and suitable and to identify and help resolve deficiencies as
early as possible. T&E:
   1.1.1. Provides information to decision makers so they may assess whether a system or
   technique is useful and cost effective.
   1.1.2. Reduces system acquisition and sustainment program risk.
   1.1.3. Gives operational users the information needed to develop doctrines, refine
   requirements, and develop and refine tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).
1.2. Types of T&E. Air Force Instruction (AFI) 99-103, Capabilities Based Test and
Evaluation, outlines overall policy for T&E activities during the development, production, and
fielding of Air Force systems. T&E falls into two general categories, developmental test and
evaluation (DT&E) and operational test and evaluation (OT&E). OT&E also includes categories
of initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E), multi-service operational test and evaluation
(MOT&E), qualification operational test and evaluation (QOT&E) and follow-on test and
evaluation (FOT&E). These types of T&E are normally conducted by the Air Force Operational
Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) for ACAT I/II programs and programs on OSD
oversight. MAJCOM support is often requested by AFOTEC for these OTA-led test efforts, and
frequently, AFOTEC defers (non-involves) testing responsibilities to the MAJCOMs. Other
OT&E-related activities include operational assessments (OA), operational utility evaluations
(OUE), foreign materiel exploitation (FME), foreign comparative test (FCT) and test support for
technology transition mechanisms. Technology transition mechanisms include advanced
technology demonstrations (ATD), advanced concept technology demonstrations (ACTD)/ Joint
Concept Technology Demonstrations (JCTD), and exercises and experiments. The focus of ACC
T&E is force development evaluation (FDE), a subset of OT&E. FDE is primarily concerned
with post-Milestone C (i.e., production and deployment phase) sustainment and operations,
acquisition, pre-planned product improvement (P3I), and associated TTP development.
Sustainment operational testing also includes tactics development and evaluation (TD&E) and
the Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP). For further guidance and definition, see AFI
99-103.
1.3. General T&E Policy. As the lead major command (MAJCOM) for CAF T&E, ACC will:
   1.3.1. Use dedicated test assets as available in the conduct of these tests IAW Air Force
   Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-9.
   1.3.2. Conduct T&E over the life of a system to ensure the system continues to meet user
   requirements and to explore means of satisfying deficiencies.
   1.3.3. To the maximum extent possible, conduct T&E in a Joint environment.
   1.3.4. Conduct FDE to support acquisition and fielding decisions, refine estimates made
   during IOT&E or QOT&E, evaluate changes and verify correction of deficiencies, assist in
   TTP development, and to reevaluate a system to ensure it continues to meet operational
   needs.

    1.3.5. ACC test units may support IOT&E, QOT&E, and FOT&E, but will not conduct these
    forms of T&E.
    1.3.6. ACC test units can support but will not lead DT&E. DT&E support should be limited
    to pursuit of operational test objectives, but units may participate in combined test force
    activities and resource sharing agreements that promote efficiency.
    1.3.7. ACC test units may support interoperability certification, military standard (MIL-
    STD) testing and DT&E support. A5J is the ACC POC for Tactical Data Link (TDL)
    interoperability and MIL-STD testing. The ACC Communication Support Squadron (CSS)
    TDL Interoperability Test Center and the Modular Control Equipment (MCE) software
    DT&E support facility are the primary organizations performing MIL-STD, interoperability
    testing and MCE software DT&E support. The ACC CSS also facilitates AF platform
    participation in joint interoperability tests performed by the Joint Interoperability Test
    Command (JITC).
    1.3.8. The United States Air Force Warfare Center (USAFWC) and the Air National Guard
    Air Force Reserve Command Test Center (AATC) are the principal organizations responsible
    for planning, coordinating and accomplishing CAF T&E.
       1.3.8.1. Test centers will develop and evaluate TTPs to support the CAF; manage and
       conduct OT&E, FDE and other OT&E-related activities; manage and conduct Air-to-Air,
       Air-to-Ground and Nuclear WSEP; and support test projects conducted by AFOTEC, Air
       Force MAJCOMs, Department of Defense (DoD) and other government agencies as
       assigned.
       1.3.8.2. T&E will be conducted using operational criteria by test personnel with
       qualifications commensurate with those who will use, maintain, and/or support the items
       being evaluated. OT&E, FDE, and TD&E will be conducted in an operationally
       representative environment.
       1.3.8.3. Each ACC test center will develop programs to appropriately train newly
       assigned or unqualified personnel in T&E procedures, policy and organization.
    1.3.9. To ensure efficient use of ACC resources, manage operational risk and ensure
    personnel safety, operational or test units will not accept taskings or offerings to participate
    in T&E activities, to include test conducted on behalf of AFGSC and AFSPC, without HQ
    ACC/A5/8/9 approval. Operational or test units requesting test support from ACC
    operational units must refer requests for T&E support requiring CAF assets to HQ ACC/A5T
    (acc.a5t@langley.af.mil).

                               GENERAL PROCEDURES

2.1. HQ ACC Oversight. The conduct of T&E often involves unique risks. A disciplined test
prioritization and approval process, the ACC Test Prioritization List (TPL) and Electronic
Project Order (EPO) processes, was established to ensure efficient use of ACC resources and
manage operational risk by ensuring T&E is accomplished by the most appropriate
organizations. All T&E related taskings will be accomplished through the EPO process. T&E
involving ACC resources will only be conducted after receipt of an EPO approved by HQ
ACC/A5/8/9 (or ACC/A5T for out-of-cycle, ACC generated test requirements), with
coordination from the appropriate ACC organizations (i.e., HQ ACC/A2/A3/A4/A5/8/9/A6/A7,
AATC/CC, USAFWC/CC). HQ ACC/A5T is designated the clearinghouse for all T&E. In this
capacity, HQ ACC/A5T is charged with reviewing all EPOs and ensuring test activities are
supported by validated operational needs. Approved EPOs are prioritized and can be found on
the TPL.

Figure 2.2. ACC Oversight Process – Out of Cycle.




2.2. Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) T&E Oversight List. OSD/Director of
Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) maintains a list of major programs that have
Congressional interest. (https://extranet.dote.osd.mil/Oversight/index.html) OSD may
become involved in the test process, test plan development, and test execution and may require
special briefings. Consequently, those programs, and their special requirements, will be
identified in project orders. All reports and briefings for those programs for which the AFOTEC
is not involved are the responsibility of ACC test agencies and will be coordinated through HQ
ACC. Exception: AFSPC documents will be coordinated through USAFWC. All test briefings
going to HQ USAF and OSD will be coordinated through AF/TE.
     2.2.1. For those oversight programs where ACC test agencies are responsible for operational
     testing, direct communication with OSD action officers by the Integrated Test Team (ITT) is
     authorized to determine OSD/DOT&E involvement, testing and reporting requirements.
     2.2.2. Where OSD action officers decline participation in test planning or the T&E forum is
     unable to make a determination as to OSD involvement or requirements, ACC test agencies
     should elevate their concerns through ACC/A5T to AF/TEP for adjudication and resolution.
2.3. Test Support for another MAJCOM, Agency or Service. Requests for T&E support
from another MAJCOM, agency or Service will be referred to HQ ACC/A5T and approved
before resources are expended. The appropriate HQ ACC division chief validates the request,
assigns an action officer to assist test organization in the preparation of an EPO, and submits the
request to HQ ACC/A5T for coordination and approval. All such support must be accompanied
ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                         9


by an O-7 level or civilian equivalent request and needs specific details to include: the support
required; the time frame for support; why the originating MAJCOM, agency or Service cannot
support the project with their own resources; how the support requested will be funded; and any
other special considerations required in the support including the points of contact (POC) with
representatives from all units (See Attachment 3, Example EPO). Test cost differences/savings
is not a viable reason for requesting ACC test support. Note: test support for AFGSC and
AFSPC will be IAW established Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and coordinated by
ACC/A5T through AFGSC/A3T and AFSPC/A3T.
2.4. Resource Management. HQ ACC/A5T is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for
USAFWC test resources. (Note: ACC/A3A provides oversight to ACC ranges.) In addition to
all programming and budgeting issues, HQ ACC/A5T is the ACC OPR for:
   2.4.1. The ACC/A5/8/9 test fleet (primary development/test aircraft inventory [PDAI]
   coded) and support aircraft assigned to the USAFWC.
   2.4.2. Aerial target program management to include all programming and support
   requirements for both full scale and subscale targets.
   2.4.3. All annual missile/drone allocations, support, and kill authorizations.
   2.4.4. Drone recovery boats for the Eglin Range operating out of Tyndall Air Force Base
   (AFB).
   2.4.5. POC for the ACC SEEK EAGLE program.
   2.4.6. Will coordinate with and receive approval of AATC/CC for any AATC resources
   required in support of CAF testing.
2.5. T&E Funding Sources. The funding sources for T&E depend upon the nature and purpose
of the work and type of testing. Test agencies are referred to DoD 7000.14-R, Financial
Management Regulation, Vol 2A, Chapter 1; AFI 65-601 Vol 1, Budget Guidance and
Procedures, Chapter 14; and AFI 99-109, Major Range & Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Test &
Evaluation Resource Planning, for explicit guidance.
   2.5.1. ACC programs are responsible for funding acquisition testing (FDE, OUE, etc.) in
   support of their respective weapon systems. Tactics development and WSEP are centrally
   funded using O&M resources from PE 28015.
   2.5.2. ACC testing is provisioned to meet CAF requirements. Accordingly, other
   MAJCOMs, services or agencies requesting ACC test support or expenditure of test assets
   will be required to provide funding commensurate with test support requested. Funding
   source, specific fund cite(s) and organizational financial point of contact information, must
   be included with test request submitted to ACC/A5/8/9 Test and Training Branch (A5TT).
2.6. Operational        Support. All requests for operational support for developmental or
operational testing must be included in an ACC EPO. HQ ACC will not task operational units
unless first deferred by a test center. The deferring test center will provide a recommendation for
an operational unit best suited for a specific test. If a CAF aviation operational unit is required,
HQ ACC/A5T will forward a request to HQ ACC/A3O IAW the AFI 10-420, CAF Aviation
Scheduling process. If operational crew member(s) support only is desired, the assigned test
agency will seek specific authorization from ACC/A3 in the form of a waiver to this ACCI.
Waiver requests will be forwarded to A5TT for staff coordination and A3 approval.
 10                                                               ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014


2.7. Electronic Project Order. A web-based EPO is approved for each test project. The EPO
includes the purpose, recommended Critical Operational Issues (COIs)/objectives (if available),
test description and deliverables, scope, funding, equipment, munitions and personnel
requirements, POC, and OSD oversight, if required. Test unit and/or operational unit
commanders will not accept, execute or support testing with assigned CAF assets without an
approved EPO. Other documents such as test and evaluation master plans (TEMP) and test
resource plans (TRP) may be required prior to test execution, but are not authorization for test
execution and do not eliminate the requirement for an EPO.
   2.7.1. To promote planning and effectively deal with the large quantity of CAF tests, ACC
   employs the TPL Process to prioritize EPOs and gain HQ ACC/A5/8/9 approval. The TPL
   process is detailed in Chapter 4. Although there are some valid reasons for late test
   identification (i.e., urgent needs request, safety-of-flight, higher headquarters direction), use
   of the TPL process should be made to the maximum extent practical. Any test not submitted
   in time to be considered in the TPL process will be handled as an out-of-cycle EPO.
       2.7.1.1. Priority tests. Urgent Operational Need (UON) and Quick Reaction Capability
       (QRC) test are in direct support of Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), and require a
       timely focused effort that must be emphasized by the tasked test center. ACC will
       prioritize tests supporting validated UONs and QRCs, and will expect all necessary test
       center support and resources be made available to the assigned task as appropriate to
       prioritization.
       2.7.1.2. Out-of-Cycle Test and Evaluation Candidate Tests. All out-of-cycle test requests
       will be submitted by memorandum to HQ ACC/A5T. The memorandum will include a
       brief test description, objectives, resources required, funding and timeframe of required
       test execution (see Attachment 2). HQ ACC/A5T will forward out-of-cycle test requests
       to 53 WG/CC and/or 505CCW/CC (courtesy copy USAFWC/A3), and AATC/DT as
       appropriate to determine their ability to support and for concurrence. After test center
       coordination of the draft EPO, A5T will staff the EPO to the appropriate agencies for
       coordination. Following coordination, A5T will consider EPOs for approval. If approved,
       the status of the EPO in the web-based system will be changed to ―approved, the
       appropriate test center will be notified by e-mail, and the test will be entered into the
       CAF TPL. Note: In this case only, A5T is the approval authority for all Out-of-Cycle test
       requests that originate within ACC. For Out-of-Cycle requests that originate from
       external agencies by way of O-7/SES equivalent request, approval authority will be
       ACC/A5/8/9.
   2.7.2. Test centers develop the EPO and process via a web-based EPO system hosted on the
   ACC                                                                                     SharePoint
   (https://application.eim.acc.af.mil/apps/epo/epo/web%20pages/start.aspx).                        For
   SharePoint website access, contact HQ ACC/A5TT at DSN 574-1088. A sample EPO is in
   Attachment 3. All agencies or staffs will work through HQ ACC/A5TT to enter tests
   into the web-based system, as required. EPO tracking numbers are automatically assigned
   and include the fiscal year (e.g., ―04), a three-digit identification number (e.g., ―001), and
   a test center identification letter (e.g., ―A). Test center identifiers are USAFWC-53 WG
   ―A, USAFWC-505 CCW ―C, and AATC ―R. Multiple suffix identifiers indicate more
   than one test center involvement. The first letter in the suffix indicates the lead test center.
ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                       11


       2.7.2.1. Regardless of whether an EPO is submitted out-of-cycle or as part of the TPL,
       the appropriate action officer or test project manager will input the test into the web -
       based EPO system. Once the test center coordination is complete, the center will submit
       the draft EPO to the HQ ACC/A5TT via a ‘submit to ACC’ function within the EPO
       SharePoint system. Each EPO should be submitted with sufficient time in advance of the
       proposed test to coordinate support, modify aircraft, etc.
   2.7.3. Blanket EPOs. If upon being tasked to support a test activity, a test center/organization
   anticipates numerous similar-type test support taskings, a blanket (a.k.a., umbrella) EPO may
   be submitted. These EPOs are not the norm, and will be considered on a case by case basis.
   In the body of the blanket EPO, it will be stipulated that all test support and test execution
   activities to be accomplished under the authority of that EPO must be first coordinated
   through ACC/A5T for oversight and formal individual project tasking. All TD&E efforts to
   be accomplished under a blanket EPO must be coordinated through ACC/A3T. Upon
   ACC/A5T tasking and approval to execute, the blanket EPO will provide ACC with the
   ability to support and/or execute evaluations of related systems, tactics-techniques-
   procedures or concepts.
   2.7.4. EPO Changes. Changes that significantly alter the scope, purpose, objectives, level of
   funding, lead test center, or participating MAJCOM of a test will require an amendment to
   the current EPO. The appropriate test project manager will input the amended EPO into the
   web-based EPO system. HQ ACC/A5T will then take action for staff coordination and
   approval of the amended EPO. Minor changes that do not include any of the above types of
   changes to a test project do not require an amendment.
   2.7.5. Suspension of an EPO. When a test program is suspended for any reason, the test
   center should forward an e-mail advising HQ ACC/A5TT with information specific to date
   of action and reason for action.
2.8. Certification of System Readiness for Operational Testing. All systems will undergo
some form of review and certification for readiness to operationally test prior to testing. ACC
test agencies responsible for conducting operational testing will perform the same certification
functions as AFOTEC in accordance with AFMAN 63-119, Certification of System Readiness
for Dedicated Operational Testing.
2.9. Test Resource Plans (TRP). A TRP is an AFOTEC document that identifies the resources
and timelines required to support an AFOTEC conducted IOT&E, FOT&E, MOT&E, QOT&E,
OUE, or OA. All projects that support AFOTEC managed tests require a TRP. HQ ACC/A5T is
the focal point for the ACC TRP coordination process. HQ ACC/A5TT will task the appropriate
staff agency to coordinate the TRP as required with other staff agencies and test centers.
Coordinated inputs will be integrated into a formal concur or non-concur memorandum directed
back to AFOTEC by HQ ACC/A5T. TRPs with an associated comment review matrix (CRM)
will     be      posted     on     the     TRP       Share     Point    Site    for   review
https://acc.eim.acc.af.mil/org/a8/a8t/a8tt/testresource/default.aspx. AFOTEC will adjudicate
each comment. The adjudicated CRM will be posted at the Share Point Site for viewing.
2.10. Test Plans. The appropriate test organization using the EPO will prepare a detailed test
plan with fidelity commensurate with the scope and complexity of the project plan. HQ
ACC/A5/8/9 will coordinate on all test plans for programs (USAFWC/CC for AFSPC test plans)
subject to OSD oversight and approval if AFOTEC is not involved. Approval of all other test
 12                                                             ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014


plans is delegated to the USAFWC/CC and AATC/CC. A signed test plan, with an approved
EPO, serves as authority for a test unit to begin test execution.
   2.10.1. A test plan for a program subject to OSD oversight requires HQ ACC/A5/8/9
   (USAFWC/CC for AFSPC test plans) coordination prior to submission to HQ AF/TE and
   OSD if AFOTEC is not involved. OSD oversight program test plans will be forwarded to HQ
   ACC/A5T for staff coordination through HQ ACC/A5/8/9 prior to OSD approval. Test
   centers must ensure sufficient time is allowed for HQ ACC staffing and will forward test
   plans to HQ ACC/A5T a minimum of fifteen days prior to suspense to HQ AF/TE. See AFI
   99-103 for OSD oversight requirements and specific guidance.
   2.10.2. Test centers will coordinate test plans with the other Services and participating test
   organizations to the extent needed to maintain an efficient continuum of testing and avoid
   duplication of effort.
   2.10.3. Test plan titles will be consistent with the title of the governing EPO.
   2.10.4. Test objectives and TTP development may be accomplished in conjunction with
   other formal tests and evaluations or exercise venues (to include WSEP missions) that
   replicate the operational environment.
   2.10.5. Test teams will develop and identify the appropriate test objectives and assessment
   criteria IAW program source documents (i.e., Capability Area Planning, Initial Capability
   Document [ICD], Capability Development Documents [CDD], TEMP, or analysis of
   alternatives [AOA]). Note: Source documents for WSEP are Commander, ACC (COMACC)
   Plans 85, 90, 001 and Commander, AFGSC Plan 001.
   2.10.6. If sufficient test criteria are not contained in program source documents, test
   organizations will coordinate with the appropriate ACC program staff functional office to
   establish acceptable criteria.
2.11. Support Plans. The supporting operational test wing/organization will determine whether
a formal test support plan is required. If required, the test support plan describes how the other
MAJCOM or agency test organizations will be supported, and normally includes information on
the scope of participation, schedule, resources and funding.
2.12. Test Conduct. A test will be conducted and executed IAW the specific approved EPO
and project test plan. Test sorties will be flown IAW MAJCOM instructions and directives,
unless the appropriate MAJCOM/A3 or A5/8/9 approves specific waivers in the test plan.
2.13. Interim Reports. Test centers may be tasked by ACC/A5T to provide status or interim
summary reports. A Status Report may be published anytime information becomes available
which will have an immediate impact on the CAF, when a program has an extended test phase or
to support a sensitive fielding decision. An Interim Summary Report may be published when the
final report cannot be ready in time to support a key or production decision. The interim reports
may include observations, conclusions and recommendations and will be sent to the same
addressees as the final report.
2.14. Quarterly and End of Year Reports. The commanding officer or his designated
representative of each ACC test wing (i.e., 53 WG and 505 CCW) as well as AATC will provide
a formal quarterly assessment memorandum to ACC/A5T identifying their test organizations‘
progress toward accomplishing the test/support documented in the current TPL (Example at
ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                      13


Attachment 4, Example Quarterly/End of Year Assessment). Referenced against the EPO
number, the basic information to be provided includes: UON/QRC support activities, test
completed (with final reports, fielding recommendations or sufficiency review published, etc.),
test support completed (of tests conducted by other agencies), test completed (in reporting
phase), tests unable to conduct (with rationale), and tests recommended for cancellation (if any).
2.15. Final Reports. Prepare final reports unless the requirement for a report has been
specifically waived in the EPO or subsequent waiver is provided by ACC/A5T under separate
correspondence. Support projects do not normally require a final report unless specified in the
EPO. Final report approval authority will be delegated to the test center commander unless
otherwise specified in the EPO.
   2.15.1. A test report for a program subject to OSD oversight and where AFOTEC is not
   involved requires HQ ACC (USAFWC/CC for AFSPC test report) coordination prior to
   submission to AF/TE and OSD. Test centers will forward OSD oversight program test
   reports to HQ ACC/A5T for staff coordination through HQ ACC/A5/8/9. Test centers must
   ensure sufficient time is allowed for HQ ACC staffing and will forward to HQ ACC/A5T a
   minimum of 15 days prior to suspense to HQ AF/TE. See AFI 99-103 for OSD oversight
   requirements and specific guidance.
   2.15.2. TTPs recommended by the T&E test team will be included in the final report, and
   HQ ACC/A3TW will be included in the distribution of the report.
   2.15.3. Lead operational test organizations will review all T&E final reports for new or
   amended TTPs and will forward same to the 561st Joint Tactics Squadron, AFTTP 3-1 OPR.
   Test centers and appropriate ACC/A3 functional offices are responsible for inclusion of this
   new information in an appropriate Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP)
   3-1 update.
2.16. Distribution. The distribution for test plans and final reports will be determined by the
test manager in conjunction with the HQ ACC, HQ AFGSC and HQ AFSPC point(s) of contact
in the EPO and will follow guidance in AFI 99-103, if applicable. Include HQ ACC/A5T on test
report distribution lists for all unclassified programs (or for classified/STINFO information).
2.17. Operational Briefings. Briefings on test results and conclusions are provided to
COCOMs and combatant crews when required to expedite the dissemination of time sensitive
information. These briefings or road-shows will be planned and funded as part of a T&E effort.
2.18. Release/Fielding Recommendations. One of the primary functions of FDE (and OUE in
the case of some low risk programs) is to provide a production or release/fielding
recommendation. In general, a release/fielding recommendation is required for fielding of all
weapon system modernization and improvement initiatives or updates. This includes revisions or
updates to any operational flight program (OFP) for any ACC or AFGSC aircraft, weapon or
integrated store (i.e., targeting pods), space or C4ISR system. The level of operational testing
required to produce a recommendation will be determined by the tasked test agency.
Clarification or questions regarding level or scope of testing will be addressed with ACC/A5TT
and the sponsoring ACC, AFSPC or AFGSC program office. Recommendations signed by the
designated test center commander are forwarded to ACC/A5T for action at
acc.a5t@langley.af.mil or for classified/STINFO information, to acc.a5t@langley.af.smil.mil.
Release/fielding recommendations may be provided to ACC/A5T under separate cover from the
 14                                                            ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014


final report, and as required by time sensitivities of the particular effort. ACC/A5T will forward
the recommendations to the appropriate ACC, AFSPC, AFGSC or other responsible agency
office(s) for staff coordination and appropriate action. If fielding authority is not specified by
regulation (i.e., AFI 63-131, AFI 63-131_ACCSUP, etc.) or program directives, ACC/A5/8/9 is
the appropriate approval authority. Note: In limited circumstances, such as periodic software
mission planning updates to an already fielded system, A5/8/9 may delegate approval authority
to division level.
2.19. Sufficiency of Test Review (SOTR). Absent any significant planned operational testing,
a formal review is conducted by operational testers of all relevant contractor and government test
data to determine if sufficient testing has been accomplished to proceed with a fielding and/or
production decision without additional testing. SOTRs are normally requested for weapons or
aircraft OFP updates of narrow or limited scope; form, fit, function hardware changes; and
potentially other applications such as C4ISR. Based on findings, SOTRs will recommend
whether or not additional testing is warranted prior to an ACC/A5/8/9, AFSPC/A3 or
AFGSC/A5 fielding/production decision.
2.20. Capabilities and Limitations Report (C&LR). A report based upon the review of all
available test data conducted by operational testers. The intent of a C&LR is to support an ACC
release of the system under test, normally aircraft OFP or mission planning software, prior to
completion of planned testing (DT and/or OT). The C&LR will include a review of all relevant
product development activity to date; documented testing accomplished; testing remaining;
outstanding product deficiencies; and suggested operational limitations. This information will be
provided to ACC/A5T without recommendation as to the advisability of releasing this item to the
CAF or AFSPC.
2.21. Verification Flight Test (VFT). To smartly use limited resources and streamline tasking
processes, routine integration verification flight(s) using ACC and/or AFGSC aircraft may be
requested to support the fielding decision of an aircraft subsystem or store. The purpose of VFT
is to provide post-DT&E integration verification information without having to conduct formal
operational test. Requests for authorization to conduct VFTs should be made by the applicable
aircraft systems group, ACC program functional, or by the designated test center commander to
ACC/A5T or AFGSC/A3.
2.22. ACC Test Support to Research and Product Development Organizations. Requests
by research or product development organizations (e.g., system program offices, DARPA,
AFRL, etc.) for test support from operational or operational test units must be vetted and
approved by ACC and, depending on the specific request, by the implementing MAJCOM (i.e.,
the USAF organization responsible for product development DT&E).
   2.22.1. Operational Unit Support. Requests for test support from operational flying units
   (e.g., those flying non-test coded aircraft) may be accepted only after obtaining concurrence
   from ACC/A5T. Flying support will be restricted to Low Risk (as assessed by an AFMC test
   hazard authority), under the direct supervision of an LDTO. These activities will be called
   "DT Assist" to indicate they are not being conducted by an operational test unit.
   2.22.2. Operational Test Unit Support.
       2.22.2.1. Requests for test support from operational test units by USAF research or
       product development offices (i.e., acquisition programs, sustainment programs, AFRL,
ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                       15


     AFISRA, etc.) may be accepted only after obtaining concurrence from ACC/A5T. In
     cases of an OTO (e.g., those flying test coded aircraft) flying in support of projects where
     no LDTO is assigned or no formal DT&E activity is planned, prior to test support
     execution, the requesting USAF research or product development office must ensure that
     all test safety reviews (test hazard analysis worksheets, risk management board, etc.) are
     accomplished and documented by the implementing MAJCOM (normally AFMC). If the
     implementing MAJCOM assesses the test safety risk as elevated (i.e., Medium or High
     Risk), OTO test support will be conducted under the direct supervision of an LDTO, with
     the appropriately credentialed developmental test aircrew members aboard the aircraft for
     risk mitigation.
     2.22.2.2. Requests for test support from operational test units by non-USAF research or
     product development organizations (e.g., Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
     NASA, etc.) may be accepted only after obtaining concurrence from ACC/A5T.
     Requests for flying support from operational test units must first be forwarded to the
     implementing MAJCOM (normally AFMC) for review, approval and assignment of an
     LDTO before support is solicited from ACC. Prior to test support execution, the
     requesting office and the implementing MAJCOM must ensure that all test safety reviews
     (test hazard analysis worksheets, risk management board, etc.) are accomplished and
     documented. If the implementing MAJCOM assesses the test safety risk as elevated
     (i.e., Medium or High Risk), the testing will be conducted by a developmental test
     organization.
     2.22.2.3. In all cases of OTO flying support, the military flight release/military certificate
     of airworthiness must be provided to the OTO before test execution commences.
     2.22.2.4. Test center and test wing commanders are authorized discretionary authority to
     waive the test hazard analysis documentation prior to commencing test execution. If this
     process is waived, ACC/A5T will be notified.               Notification will include
     rationale/justification for waiver.
 16                                                              ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014


                                            Chapter 3

                       CAF TACTICS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

3.1. ACC Tasking. ACC is tasked to serve as lead MAJCOM in developing, documenting, and
disseminating tactics for the CAF. The CAF Tactics Development Program, described in this
instruction is designed to meet that responsibility. Specific program guidance may be found in
AFI 11-260, Combat Air Forces Tactics Development Program. The program‘s broad goals are
to:
   3.1.1. Identify tactics deficiencies in all areas of fighter, bomber, rescue, command and
   control, information operations, space integration, cyberspace, intelligence, surveillance and
   reconnaissance (ISR) and air defense sector operations.
   3.1.2. Use the appropriate mission area plans (or flight plans) as complementing
   document(s) to the CAF Tactics Development Program for identification of tactics
   deficiencies.
   3.1.3. Conduct a formal TD&E program to correct tactical deficiencies by developing new
   tactics.
   3.1.4. Continually validate existing tactics against emerging threats and new technologies.
   3.1.5. Consolidate and rapidly disseminate tactical information.
   3.1.6. Develop tactics for new or modified weapons systems entering the CAF inventory.
3.2. Tactics Development. Tactics development starts as early in the acquisition cycle as
possible. Incorporate TTP objectives in IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E, and FDE to the maximum
extent practical. For aircraft modifications such as OFP upgrades, the FDE may be the only
opportunity to evaluate impact on tactics.
3.3. Tactics Improvement Proposal (TIP). Each level of command will evaluate tactics for
areas within its expertise and submit a TIP when appropriate IAW AFI 11-260. Subordinate units
should review the appropriate mission area plan(s) (MAP) or flight plan(s) during their
preparation for and conduct of the annual Tactics Development Program. Responsibilities
include:
   3.3.1. MAJCOM and Numbered Air Force (NAF) - deployment, combat planning, combat
   operations, tasking of combat forces, and command and control of forces.
   3.3.2. Test Centers - weapons and tactics issues that result from the centers‘ activities.
   3.3.3. Wing, Group, and Air Defense Sectors - weapons and tactics issues related to the
   designed operational capability (DOC) statement, local tasking, or Air Expeditionary Force
   (AEF) tasking.
   3.3.4. Squadrons - weapons and tactics issues related to any aspect of mission planning and
   execution.
3.4. Approval Level Responsibilities. HQ ACC/A3 is the tasking and approval level for the
CAF Tactics Development Program. HQ ACC/A3T is the OPR and project office. HQ ACC/A3
will:
ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                         17


   3.4.1. Coordinate with appropriate MAJCOM/A3s, National Guard Bureau (NGB/A3) and
   AFRC/A3 on programs that affect their respective activities.
   3.4.2. When requested by HQ ACC/A5/8/9, provide a concept of employment for the
   applicable OT&E or FDE to ensure tactics development starts as early as possible in the
   acquisition cycle.
   3.4.3. Participate in technical order (T.O.) approval, as required.
   3.4.4. Formal tasking and approval for conduct of TD&Es will be IAW the process outlined
   in this instruction. A5/8/9 (in coordination with A3) is the final approval authority for all test
   activity included on the TPL.
3.5. Test Organizations. USAFWC and AATC are the primary TD&E organizations. Selected
units may also be tasked to assist the TD&E effort, as appropriate. Test centers are selected to
conduct specific TD&E projects based on unique capabilities, resource availability, and
projected workload.
3.6. AFTTP Responsibilities. AFTTP are the primary source of tactics information for the
CAF, IAW AFI 11-260 and AFTTP 3-1, General Planning, Attachment 4. They contain
information that has been validated and has CAF-wide concurrence.
   3.6.1. HQ ACC/A3 is the designated primary review authority for AFTTP and is responsible
   for the content and approval of AFTTP volumes. ACC/A3 delegates AFTTP program
   oversight to ACC/A3TW, who in turn works with the 561JTS for updating AFTTP volumes
   to include volume management, production and dissemination.
   3.6.2. Test Centers will review applicable information sources on weapon systems for which
   they have tactics responsibilities and identify information for inclusion in AFTTP 3-1 or
   TD&E final and interim reports. Any TTPs identified for inclusion in AFTTP 3-1 volumes
   should be forwarded to the 561JTS. The 561JTS will assign the inputs to the appropriate
   Mission Design Series (MDS) model manager for potential inclusion in the next AFTTP 3-1
   rewrite. If through operational testing, OT&E develops TTPs that are time perishable and
   which need immediate dissemination, OT&E squadron commanders can submit those TTPs
   to the 561JTS in the form of an OT Flash Bulletin (FB) (see AFTTP 3-1GP Attachment 4).
   The 561JTS will assign the FB to the appropriate MDS model manager and facilitate
   domain-wide dissemination (as well as track for potential inclusion into future AFTTP 3-1
   rewrites).
   3.6.3. Specific procedures and responsibilities for the management of AFTTP are contained
   in AFTTP 3-1, Volume 1, General Planning, Attachment 4.
   3.6.4. Changes to AFTTP are published on an as-needed basis. These changes contain
   executive summaries of interim and final reports and any other information releasable to the
   CAF as valid tactics.
3.7. Identification of Tactics Deficiencies. Identified deficiencies are documented on a TIP
and forwarded through the appropriate chain of command to HQ ACC/A3T. Units can submit a
TIP anytime new tactics need validating or a tactical deficiency is recognized. HQ ACC assigns
the TIP to the appropriate OPR for action if immediate testing is required. A proposed change to
operations or training procedures, as contained in the 11-series manuals, should be submitted by
 18                                                             ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014


message to HQ ACC/A3T. The TIP process will not be used to request modification or
acquisition of hardware or software.
   3.7.1. If a TIP is of immediate concern and affects current operations and testing, forward
   the TIP immediately to the respective MAJCOM weapons and tactics office. HQ ACC will
   assign the TIP to the appropriate OPR for action if immediate testing is required.
   3.7.2. The Annual Tactics Review Board (TRB) will be chaired by HQ ACC/A3 no later
   than 15 Jan of each year in order to support the TPL process. Detailed procedures for the
   TRB are in AFI 11-260. All TIPs approved for formal evaluation are made part of the Test
   Priority List and forwarded to the respective test centers for incorporation into the respective
   OT&E, FDE and/or TD&E test programs.
   3.7.3. The ACC project officer will support the test manager in developing an EPO for each
   TD&E test. The project order is input into the EPO system and includes the recommended
   objectives, scope (i.e., cost, sorties, type aircraft), and munitions requirements. Due to the
   time sensitive nature of tactical deficiencies, each TD&E is scoped for completion within one
   calendar year.
3.8. Tactics Investigations (TI). TI’s are a test sub-category of the CAF Tactics Development
Program designed to serve two purposes currently not accommodated by TD&Es: 1) support
initial stage and/or subsequent stages of a TPL-tasked TD&E in a resource-streamlined manner;
or 2) provide a means to address “fleeting, target of opportunity” tactics development, where
formulating a traditional annual CAF TRB/WEPTAC-vetted TPL-TD&E would not meet
required test execution timelines or would be of needless scope and/or complexity. TIs are not
intended to supplant TPL-tasked TD&Es simply to avoid either legitimate range “test” expenses;
or the technical rigor, oversight, administrative, and approval processes inherent in conducting a
TD&E.
   3.8.1. TI’s whose test scope/content is already authorized by a TPL-tasked TD&E require no
   additional ACC authorization. ACC/A5T and A3T will be notified whenever a TI is being
   used to satisfy a specific portion of an authorized TD&E tasking.
       3.8.1.1. If the specific test scope/content of a TPL-tasked TD&E (i.e., “blanket” TD&E
       EPO) is not documented in the EPO, a TI request-for-approval will be processed IAW
       paragraph 3.8.3.
   3.8.2. TI’s not already authorized by a TPL-tasked TD&E will be specifically tasked by
   ACC/A5T against a blanket TPL TI EPO, which authorizes TI’s to be accomplished via an
   expeditious – but systematic – tasking, planning, review/approval, execution, and reporting
   test methodology. Note: ACC/A3T(W) will be responsible for coordinating proposed TI
   with all appropriate ACC staff divisions.
   3.8.3. TI Request Process.
       3.8.3.1. For TI’s not covered by an approved TIP, units will submit TI requests on an AF
       IMT 4326, Tactic Improvement Proposal, coordinated through an ACC test wing or test
       center and routed to ACC/A3TW (or AFGSC/A3T) as an out-of-cycle request. The final
       AF IMT 4326 block will be checked ‘CONCUR w/INTENT’ and recommend the test be
       completed as a TI.
ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                      19


     3.8.3.2. The ACC EPO/tasking process should be initiated by a TI request from any
     ACC test wing or test center O-6 directly to ACC/A5T. This request will include both a
     TI description and scope (to include estimated range costs); this TI request will be written
     (e-mail ok) and will utilize the standard ACC test request template format.
  3.8.4. TI events may piggyback on test sorties tasked against any appropriate TPL EPO. TIs
  may also be executed in simulators, when feasible, as an economic alternative to open air
  testing.
  3.8.5. For all TI missions not funded by a TPL test project, the following guidelines apply:
  1) ranges will not be asked to incur/absorb any costs (i.e., specialized threat systems) outside
  the scope of assets normally included in a training sortie; 2) use of training sorties will not
  normally be authorized in cases where a supporting range concludes that the scope of a
  proposed TI requires initiation of a formal agreement (i.e., project identification document
  (PID)/statement of capability (SOC) process); and 3) ACC field units will incur no costs for
  TIs above those ordinarily required to fund flying hours, organic manpower, and routine
  training range usage.

                         TEST PRIORITY LIST (TPL) PROCESS

4.1. TPL Process.
   4.1.1. Each year, HQ ACC prioritizes CAF T&E programs for USAFWC and AATC
   execution. ACC also prioritizes test support to other MAJCOMs, Services and Agencies
   (Figure 4.1 TPL Process). Once identified, EPOs will be prioritized and approved in mass
   for the upcoming fiscal year (FY). With the approval of the TPL, test units are authorized to
   conduct test planning and execution. A test request failing to be submitted in time to be
   considered in the TPL process will be handled as an out-of-cycle request, and will follow
   specific guidelines established in paragraph 2.7.1.2 The TPL sets the relative priority of
   projects for ACC operational test agencies and serves as a guide for allocating resources (i.e.,
   funding, scheduling, aircraft, and personnel). (Note: per agreement, AFSPC TPL will be an
   adjunct to ACC TPL with priority established by AFSPC.)
   4.1.2. The TPL is a guide for HQ ACC/A3/A5/8/9, USAFWC and AATC scheduling and
   resource allocation and is not a guarantee that a project will be executed.

Figure 4.1. TPL Process.




4.2. Annual Call for Tests. See Figure 4.2 Call for Tests.
ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                      21


   4.2.1. Each year, HQ ACC/A5T will e-mail a “Call for Test” memorandum to all HQ
   ACC/A5/8/9/A2/A3/A4/A6/A7 divisions, USAFWC/CC, AATC/CC and other MAJCOMs,
   Services and Agencies, as appropriate, requesting their respective staffs and subordinate test
   units provide their next FY T&E proposed test requirements list(s) to HQ ACC/A5TT. This
   “Call for Test” memorandum is the first step in the annual TPL Process. Specific to TD&E,
   HQ ACC/A3T will hold a CAF Tactics Review Board to review the TIPs submitted and a
   Weapons and Tactics Conference to approve the TIPs. Approved TIPs become the basis for
   the following FY TD&E list submitted to A5TT.
   4.2.2. HQ ACC/A5/8/9 sends the “Call for Test” memorandum concurrently to specific non-
   ACC USAF MAJCOM and test agencies, requesting they provide their list, accompanied
   with a brief description for each of their test efforts requiring ACC assets and/or personnel
   support.
   4.2.3. Upon receipt of the all source test execution and support requirements, HQ
   ACC/A5TT will compile the test and evaluation candidate list, and begin to populate the TPL
   scoring matrices. HQ ACC/A5TT will coordinate the proposed FY test listing with ACC‘s
   test organizations; i.e., USAFWC and AATC. After completing their review, the ACC test
   organizations will use the FY test listing in their preparation for the February program review
   and prioritization scoring by the TPL Integrated Product Team (IPT). The effort will include
   the drafting and submission of a draft EPO for each of the FY test programs, as appropriate
   (Example at Attachment 3). For this reason, test center OPRs need to be identified at the
   earliest opportunity.

Figure 4.2. Call for Tests.
 22                                                            ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014


4.3. TPL IPT.
   4.3.1. The TPL IPT includes subject matter experts from the test centers and the program
   element monitors (PEM) from HQ ACC and other agencies as appropriate.
   4.3.2. The IPT’s charter is the review and prioritization of all proposed FY CAF T&E
   programs.
4.4. TPL IPT Program Review. The purpose of the program review is to:
   4.4.1. Make the TPL IPT members knowledgeable of each identified FY T&E candidate
   project. This is accomplished by allowing HQ ACC division chiefs/designated
   representatives, ACC test center personnel, and other MAJCOM or test organization
   personnel the opportunity to brief the IPT members about the details of proposed test
   projects. The HQ ACC/A3TW members will brief TD&Es approved by the CAF TRB and
   HQ ACC/A3. For all FY new start tests:
      4.4.1.1. A HQ ACC representative (i.e., HQ ACC PEM, action officer, or A5TT), in
      conjunction with the test center representative, will provide the IPT copies of the specific
      test request template (see Attachment 2) or draft EPO (see Attachment 3) if available,
      for each new FY test. The test request template or draft EPO must contain sufficient
      detail to convey the test purpose, scope, objectives and resources. A short program
      overview, based on either of the stated documents data, will be presented to the IPT.
      4.4.1.2. A5TT will pre-score tests to the maximum extent possible with ACC
      representatives. The IPT membership will review the pre-scoring and question the test
      program representative, if available. The information presented from the draft EPO or
      test request template will be used as a point of reference during the formal TPL scoring
      process.
   4.4.2. Allow the IPT to screen all identified FY T&E candidate projects for validity and
   supportability.
   4.4.3. Provide an information base so IPT members can generate a relevant score of each FY
   T&E effort against the criteria established in the test prioritization scoring worksheet to
   formulate a prioritized list of tests; i.e., a draft FY TPL.
      4.4.3.1. FY carry-over tests will be advocated by a test center representative with the IPT
      being provided copies of the approved EPO.
          4.4.3.1.1. Any change in objectives, scope or resources required must be addressed to
          the IPT.
          4.4.3.1.2. The IPT will prioritize the carry-over tests and determine if an amendment
          to the approved EPO is warranted. EPO will be re-scored by consensus of the TPL
          IPT.
4.5. TPL IPT Scoring Methodology. Following the review of each T&E candidate program,
the TPL IPT will:
   4.5.1. Apply the scoring analysis and matrices to provide a point score; i.e., all identified
   programs are validated/prioritized against an established linked matrices process, with
   imbedded values for operational payback, technical risk, user need date, and directed
ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                 23


   authority (Figure 4.3, Scoring Methodology). This process of review and score will be
   accomplished against the combined group of candidate T&E programs.

Figure 4.3. Scoring Methodology.




   4.5.2. The final output of the scoring matrix will produce the combined CAF draft priority
   list for the next FY from the TPL IPT QFD (Quality Function Deployment) (Figure 4.4 Test
   Priority List).

Figure 4.4. Test Priority List.




4.6. TPL Approval Process. After TPL IPT adjournment, HQ ACC/A5TT will finalize a FY
draft TPL:
   4.6.1. The proposed FY TPL will be distributed for review, comment and coordination via e-
   mail memorandum NLT 10 working days after the TPL IPT adjourns. All coordination must
   be funneled back through HQ ACC/A5TT for action. All tests listed in the proposed FY TPL
   will have a corresponding web-based EPO. During the coordination effort on the TPL,
   individual EPOs will be available for review, as necessary.
   4.6.2. TPL staff coordination and approval will be accomplished in three stages:
       4.6.2.1. HQ ACC division (3-letter), 53 WG/CC, AATC/CC, USAFWC/A3 and
       505CCW/CC coordination.
       4.6.2.2. HQ ACC directors (2-letter), USAFWC/CC, and AATC/CC coordination, as
       required.
       4.6.2.3. HQ ACC/A5/8/9 review and approval.
ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                      25

Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Project Officer—An
individual assigned to the ANG and AFRC Staffs, in the case of activities associated with
AATC, serving as a POC for coordination with the ACC project officer, who monitors the test
and provides command coordination and support as required.
CAF Test Priority List—An annual list approved by HQ ACC/A5/8/9 that identifies the
relative priority of all active and projected FY ―XX T&E projects for a given fiscal year. HQ
ACC/A5TT is the OPR for producing the priority list.
Electronic Project Orders—A formal headquarters document, hosted in a web-based system
that authorizes the test center to participate in a project. EPOs are issued for all T&E projects.
Force Development Evaluation (FDE)—The operational test and evaluation of fielded,
operational systems during the sustainment portion of the system life cycle after acceptance for
operational use. The focus is on maintaining or upgrading operational systems after the initial
acquisition process is complete. An FDE also supports acquisition on MAJCOM-managed
systems.
OT&E Project—An OT&E project supports a defense acquisition decision by evaluating the
operational effectiveness and suitability of a system, subsystem, or system modification;
identifying operational deficiencies; or identifying the need for modifications. An OT&E project
order is usually for MAJCOM-conducted operational testing and/or FDE.
Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE)—OUEs are evaluations of military capabilities
conducted to demonstrate or validate new operational concepts or capabilities, upgrade
ACCI99-101 27 AUGUST 2014                                                                     39


components, or expand the mission or capabilities of existing or modified systems. An OUE also
supports acquisition on MAJCOM managed systems.
Project Manager—An individual assigned to the USAF Warfare Center (USAFWC) or the Air
National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center (AATC) who is directly responsible
for the management and coordination of all activities associated with the planning, conduct, and

AFMC-conducted DT&E, other Service-conducted T&E projects, JT&E, and FCT.
Test Director—An individual responsible for directing an OT&E or Developmental T&E
(DT&E) test team respectively, or overseeing execution of the project according to the test plan.
Tactics Development and Evaluation (TD&E)—TD&E is specifically designed to further
exploit doctrine, system capabilities, tactics, techniques and procedures during the sustainment
portion of the system life cycle. TD&Es normally identify non-material solutions to tactical
problems or evaluate better ways to use new or existing systems.
Test and Evaluation (T&E)—The act of generating empirical data during the research,
development or sustainment of systems, and the creation of information through analysis that is
useful to technical personnel and decision makers for reducing design and acquisition risks. The
process by which systems are measured against requirements and specifications, and the results
analyzed so as to gauge progress and provide feedback.
Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP)—Conducted by MAJCOMs to provide an end-
to-end tailored evaluation of fielded weapon systems and their support systems using realistic
combat scenarios. WSEP also conducts investigative firings to revalidate capabilities or better
understand munitions malfunctions.

PROPOSED TEST NAME: _______________________________________________

1. In-Cycle Submission. If this request is in response to ACC A5/8/9’s FY Call for Tests, and
in compliance with its established suspense, continue to paragraph 3, and fill in the template’s
required information.

2. Out-of-Cycle Submission. If this request is not in response to the ACC A5/8/9 FY Call for
Tests, or failed to meet its established suspense, the submitting organization must provide
rationale in the request as to why test or test support was not submitted in-cycle.

3. Proposal

    a. DESCRIPTION: Provide brief summary, yet sufficient information for an ACC/A5TT
representatives to understand, of what the proposed item under test (i.e., SW / HW, etc.) brings
to the table over and above the current system’s capabilities; or, for brand new capability, what it
offers the warfighter.

                 EXAMPLE: Test will support integration of the combat-proven AGM-114
Hellfire II missile onto the A-10C aircraft. This initiative aims to demonstrate that the AGM-114
can fill the void for a very accurate laser-guided missile capable of rapidly targeting both fixed
and moving targets, with low collateral damage in urban areas or complex terrain. Based on the
results of this Initiative, ACC may make a recommendation to proceed with qualification of the
AGM-114 on the A-10C.
