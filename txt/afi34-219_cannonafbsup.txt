1.5.4. (Added) New Mexico has a Dram Shop Law imposing legal liability for serving alcohol to a person
who is intoxicated (New Mexico Statues, Chapter 41, Article 11-1). Facility managers will report individ-
uals involved in alcohol-related incidents; i.e., fights, destruction of property, etc., to the Security Forces

substance abuse clinic for evaluation of alcohol-related issues.

erages at wing events; e.g., wing picnics, air shows, etc.
2.1.6.3. (Added) Squadron commanders and Wing Staff Agency Chiefs are authorized to furnish alco-
holic beverages at squadron or Wing Staff Agency activities providing adequate safeguards have been

erage. The request must also include the date, time, duration and if food and nonalcoholic beverages will
be served.
