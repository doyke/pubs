SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Significant
revisions include guidance changes to standards for no notice and minimal notice inspections,
references to the AF eight step problem solving model leading to identification of root causes
and solutions to deficiencies, changes to inspection graded areas, and expands AFSOC self
inspection guidance. Other changes were made in reference to total force implications and
emergency management (EM), and the creation of standardized Headquarters Air Force (HAF)
inspection checklists, and the requirement to notify The Inspector General (TIG) when exceeding
inspection frequency. This instruction combines AFSOCI 90201, AF Special Operations

                       AFSOC INSPECTION PROGRAM GUIDELINES

2.1. General Guidelines. HQ AFSOC/IG will establish inspection programs to exercise
headquarters oversight of subordinate and gained units consistent with mission requirements and
inspection program guidelines outlined in AFI 90-201 and this instruction. HQ AFSOC/IG will
conduct independent inspections to assess unit efficiency, effectiveness, combat readiness, and
report results of such inspections to the AFSOC/CC and SAF/IG. AFSOC functional and
directorate staffs, working closely with their IG counterparts, will develop applicable guidelines,
procedures, criteria, checklists, and resolution requirements for conducting these inspections.
     2.1.1. Inspection Notification. For active duty (AD) units, notification for regularly
     scheduled inspections will be a minimum of six months for CIs and ORIs. ARC unit
     notification for regularly scheduled inspections will be forwarded to; the unit IG and/or
     Gatekeeper and the ARC Gatekeeper with a minimum one year notice.
        2.1.1.1. No-notice and minimal-notice inspections are conducted to assess the day-to-day
        compliance and operational readiness of units. No-notice and minimal-notice can be
        used for either full-scale or limited-scale inspections. Not applicable to ARC.
            2.1.1.1.1. For all units, no-notice is defined as 72 hours or less; minimal-notice is less
            than 45 calendar days. Gatekeepers will be included in the planning of these
            inspections and will be treated as trusted agents. Not applicable to ARC.
            2.1.1.1.2. HQ AFSOC/IG recognizes there may be limited availability of active duty
            and ARC unit personnel in some functional areas.
            2.1.1.1.3. HQ AFSOC/IG will make every effort to minimize notification to the 352
            SOG and 353 SOG when inspecting outside regularly scheduled inspections based on
            the host nation and NATO limitations.
     2.1.2. Inspection Footprint. The HQ AFSOC/IG will minimize the inspection footprint to
     the maximum extent practical. When deemed appropriate, HQ AFSOC/IG may give credit
     for unit activity in conjunction with exercises and contingencies, real world operations,
     combined inspections, other inspections/evaluations, and other measures of sustained
     performance to minimize footprints. These measures can be used to adjust the breadth,
     duration, and incidence of inspection activities. When practical, IG teams may deploy to
     forward locations and headquarters during exercises and contingency operations to evaluate
     processes and performance. Inspectors may observe, but will not interfere with, real world
     activities unless observed actions are in direct violation of AFIs, technical data, or injury to
     personnel and/or damage to equipment could occur.
        2.1.2.1. When scheduling inspections for ARC units gained by multiple MAJCOMs, HQ
        AFSOC/IGs will coordinate the inspection schedule in order to conduct concurrent
        MAJCOM inspections, to the maximum extent possible.
        2.1.2.2. It is AFSOC policy to schedule CIs, EESOHCAMPs, ASEVs, LCAPs, Safety
        inspections, and other formal inspections concurrently (or near concurrently) whenever
        possible to reduce the inspection footprint on the inspected units.
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                      9


  2.1.3. Inspection Alignment with deployment battle rhythm. Make every attempt to de-
  conflict inspections with deployment battle rhythm, enabler unit deployments, and out of
  cycle expeditionary support deployments. If possible, avoid inspecting units within 60 days
  before or after a major deployment (more than 20 percent of a unit’s assigned personnel
  deployed). Final determination with be with HQ AFSOC/IG.
  2.1.4. Inspection Frequency Deviations. AFSOC/CC approval is required to exceed any
  inspection frequency directed in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. HQ AFSOC/IG
  will notify SAF/IG when a unit will exceed the required inspection frequency and will
  provide the anticipated inspection date(s).
  2.1.5. HAF Checklists.
     2.1.5.1. HAF checklists standardize assessment criteria and facilitate AF and AFSOC
     inspection, evaluation, and unit self inspection programs. These checklists and templates
     will        be        available         on       the       AF       Checklist        site
     (https://www.my.af.mil/reservenetprod/talonsupport/home.aspx).
     2.1.5.2. Functional checklists are a tool available for use by AFSOC Headquarters and
     unit personnel when conducting assessments of programs or activities. The checklists do
     not constitute the order or limit the scope of any inspection or unit self inspection. The
     checklists do not limit the requirement to comply with any published DOD or AF
     policies, directives, or instructions.
     2.1.5.3. Once an applicable HAF checklist is published, AFSOC will supplement HAF
     checklists with AFSOC references, as required for command-specific responsibilities.
     AFSOC will not supplement HAF checklists with any guidance authored above the
     AFSOC level. Checklists will be coordinated with applicable HAF functionals, AFRC,
     and NGB. AFSOC functional will include a comprehensive list of references used in
     each checklist (AFIs, DODDs, etc) and identify the units listed in paragraph 3.1.2. to
     which each checklist applies.
     2.1.5.4. Checklist Currency. Checklists must be updated within 90 days of guidance
     changes being posted on the AF e-Publishing website. All checklists will be reviewed
     annually by the AFSOC functional staffs; HAF checklist review/update conducted NLT
     31 Jan with AFSOC supplement review/update NLT 31 Mar. All updates will be
     approved by HQ AFSOC/IG for AFSOC checklist updates.
     2.1.5.5. Until HAF checklists are published, HQ AFSOC/IG and FAMs will continue to
     use and maintain the AFSOCI 90-205 inspection checklists.
  2.1.6. Selection for Performance-based Evaluations. Inspection teams will randomly select
  individuals/teams for executing performance based evaluations in lieu of the inspected unit
  self identifying individuals/teams for evaluation (maintain team integrity as appropriate).
  2.1.7. Rating System. Inspection criteria serve as a guideline and are not a substitute for
  sound inspector judgment. For Total Force Integration initiative units, the association will be
  given an overall comprehensive rating to reflect how the integrated unit would have
  performed had the integrated units been presented to a combatant commander for
  employment.
10                                                              AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


  2.1.8. Validation. The AFSOC validation process provides the inspected unit the
  opportunity to clarify and/or rebut in a timely manner any potential deficiencies identified
  during the inspection as well as coordinate with the appropriate AFSOC FAM(s) on all
  critical and significant deficiencies identified during the inspection. Inspectors will validate
  all potential deficiencies at the lowest appropriate unit and AFSOC FAM level and resolve
  any policy interpretation differences with the appropriate FAM/OPR. All validated
  deficiencies will be documented in the report. This process also applies to deficiencies
  levied against other AFSOC units or HHQ organizations.
  2.1.9. Use of Contractors. Contractors are prohibited from acting in the capacity of an IG
  inspector; however, contractors may be consulted for their functional expertise. Use of
  contractors must be in compliance with DOD Instruction 1100.22, Guidance for Determining
  Workforce Mix.
  2.1.10. Contracted Functions. Assess and rate contracted functions against Performance
  Work Statements (PWS). Assess adequacy of PWS to meet mission requirements. Tailor
  functional checklists to address differences between AF checklists and PWS requirements.
  The contracting officer and/or quality assurance (QA) personnel should accompany the IG
  during inspections. Develop and implement safeguards to prevent contractor claims related
  to inspections activities.
     2.1.10.1. Rating and Report. Contracted functions will be rated; however, individual
     contractors will not. Sampling of contracted activity will be coordinated through QA
     personnel. Contractors may be provided with applicable portions of the report in
     accordance with (IAW) DOD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement, DOD Freedom
     of Information Act Program; and AFI 90201, Inspector General Activities.
     2.1.10.2. Validation of Contracted Functions. Validate observations related to contractor
     functions with the contracting officer and appropriate unit personnel. Track deficiencies
     IAW paragraph 2.6., Inspection Write-ups. Note: Only the Contracting Officer can take
     formal action against the contractor for noncompliance or direct contractors to correct
     deficiencies identified during inspections.
     2.1.10.3. Inspector Training. Inspectors and augmentees will complete Phase I QA
     personnel training or similar on-line training listed below prior to inspecting contracted
     functions. Phase I QA personnel training provides general knowledge of QA personnel
     responsibilities and procedures. On-line training shall consist of at least two of the
     following three courses:
         2.1.10.3.1. ―Seven Steps to Performance-Based Acquisition‖ training available on-
         line at: http://www.arnet.gov/comp/seven_steps/index.html.
         2.1.10.3.2. Defense Acquisition University (DAU) CLC106, ―COR (Contracting
         Officer Representative) with a Mission Focus‖, available online at:
         https://learn.dau.mil/html/login/login.jsp.
         2.1.10.3.3. The Air Force module on Performance-Based Services Acquisition
         available                             on-line                           at:

AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                         11


   2.1.11. Installation Exercise Program Office (IEPO).
       2.1.11.1. Organization. The wing/installation commander determines whether the
       exercise program resides under the vice commander (CV), plans and programs office
       (XP), IG, or other equivalent staff level office, unless otherwise directed by HQ AFSOC.
       2.1.11.2. Staffing. Staffing levels vary among units based on mission complexity, but
       adequate manning is essential to mission readiness. Successful IEPOs typically have
       three or more personnel assigned. Recommended staffing includes, as a minimum, one
       officer (field grade or civilian equivalent) and one enlisted (senior noncommissioned
       officer (SNCO) or civilian equivalent). IEPO offices typically include a blend of AF
       specialty codes (AFSC) and experience that complement the mission requirements.
       2.1.11.3. Training. Prior to evaluating wing/installation activities, exercise evaluation
       team (EET) members will complete the core training outlined in AFI 10-2501, Air Force
       Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. Additional training
       may be directed by the EET chief to enable EET members to meet specialized team,
       functional area, host nation, or local requirements or standards. EET members may
       attend the USAF Inspectors Course as outlined in paragraph 2.9., IG Inspector Eligibility,
       Training and Certification. IEPO personnel and wing-designated EET members should
       serve as HQ AFSOC/IG inspection team augmentees when requested by HQ AFSOC.
   2.1.12. Exercise Safety. During exercises where immediate distinction between non-
   participants (i.e., inspectors, evaluators, and observers) and participants (i.e., unit personnel,
   exercise players, and opposition forces (OPFOR)) is important to exercise safety, security,
   and/or success, nonparticipants will be clearly identified through the wear of safety/reflective
   vests or other clearly identifiable markings. Safety procedures and markings will be included
   in all exercise plans/scenarios and must be disseminated prior to the start of evaluations or
   exercises. Use appropriate operational risk management practices during planning and
   execution of exercise events.
2.2. Limited Inspections. Limited inspections are smaller, targeted inspections that assess
selected elements of operational readiness and/or compliance of inspected units. Limited
inspections have a smaller footprint than a full-scale inspection. Limited inspections will be
rated on the same scale as the associated full scale inspection.
2.3. Additional Inspections.
   2.3.1. Federal Recognition Inspection (FRI). AFSOC will conduct a FRI of a state unit
   when the unit is being considered for federal recognition or when asked to do so by the NGB.
   Conduct the FRI according to AFI 90-201 ANG Supplement, Inspector General Activities.
   As soon as an acceptable FRI is complete on a unit, the gaining command assumes the
   responsibility assigned in AFI 10-301, Responsibilities of the Air Reserve Component (ARC)
   Forces.
   2.3.2. Wounded, Ill, and Injured (WII) Facility Inspections. When applicable AFSOC/IGs
   will conduct WII Facility Inspections, as required by National Defense Authorization Act
   (NDAA) Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, House Record (H.R.) 4986, Section 1662, Access of
   Recovering Service Members to Adequate Outpatient Residential Facilities. WII Facility
   Inspections may be conducted in conjunction with other inspections (ORI, CI) but will be a
   separate, distinct inspection providing a separate inspection report. WII Facility Inspections
12                                                              AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


  will utilize a 3-tier rating scale: In Compliance, In Compliance with Comments, Not In
  Compliance.
     2.3.2.1. Frequency. IAW NDAA FY 2008, H.R.4986, Section 1662, WII Facility
     Inspections will be conducted on a semi-annual basis CY 2009, then annually thereafter.
     2.3.2.2. Scope. Criteria and actions IAW NDAA FY 2008, H.R.4986, Sec 1662, and
     DOD Housing Inspection Standards for Medical Hold and Holdover Personnel. WII
     Facility Inspections assess the condition of facilities for those Airmen currently on
     Medical Hold occupying AF-owned properties. Individuals recuperating in privately-
     owned housing fall outside the scope of these inspections.
     2.3.2.3. Responsibilities. When applicable, conduct WII Facility Inspections within
     AFSOC on schedule directed by SAF/IGI. Provide individual inspection reports to
     AFIA/SG NLT 60 days prior to OSD-established close-out date. Post individual
     inspection reports on AFSOC public website (or direct hyperlink to reports on AFW2
     public website).
  2.3.3. FAM evaluations, assessments, and other inspections. HQ AFSOC/IG may elect to
  use the results of command FAM evaluations, assessments, other inspections and/or audits in
  lieu of additional IG inspections in those areas provided the criteria used in those evaluations
  meet or exceed the requirements of this instruction. When utilized, the HQ AFSOC/IG will
  publish the results of the FAM evaluations, assessments, or other inspections in the
  appropriate section of the inspection report for that unit. The HQ AFSOC directorate
  administering the evaluation must coordinate ORI or CI credit prior to the evaluation and will
  provide the results of the evaluation to the HQ AFSOC/IG following the evaluation. If the
  evaluation, assessment, other inspection or audit does not occur as planned, a determination
  must be made on how the unit will be inspected in that area.
  2.3.4. Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Visit (ASEV). HQ AFSOC/A3 ensures
  subordinate units are in compliance with AF instructions, MDS-specific grading criteria and
  appropriate HHQ guidance IAW AFSOC Supplement to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
  Standardization/Evaluation Program.
  2.3.5. Air Traffic System Evaluation Program (ATSEP) is the HQ AFSOC/A3 evaluation of
  the air traffic system's safety, effectiveness and compliance with HQ USAF and FAA
  standards IAW AFI 13-218, Air Traffic System Evaluation Problem. ATSEP will use the
  Functional Area Checklists (FAC) available on the AFFSA Airfield Operations Directorate
  website to evaluate compliance with established guidance and standards.
  2.3.6. Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP). HQ AFSOC/A4 validates basic
  logistics assessment policy and procedures are being used throughout the AFSOC logistics
  community, and provide senior leadership and management direction for standardizing and
  verifying the accomplishment of the mission in accordance with policy IAW AFI 20-111,
  Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP). LCAP functional checklists are
  published by AF/A4L in coordination with Lead MAJCOMs and posted on the AF Checklist
  site (https://wwwmil.afrc.af.mil/afia/).
  2.3.7. Health Services Inspection (HSI) and Joint Commission on Accreditation of
  Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) Inspections. HQ AFSOC/SG will coordinate with the
  Air Force Inspection Agency (AFIA) for combined HSI and JCAHO inspections to assess the
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                   13


   ability of AFSOC medical units to fulfill peace/wartime missions, including medical care and
   support of the host wing mission as well as access health care quality. AFIA is responsible
   for conducting a HSI IAW AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Air Force Inspection
   Agency, Medical Operations Directorate (AFIA/SG), annually updates the inspection guide
   and posts it to the AFIA Community of Practice.
   2.3.8. Safety Inspection. HQ AFSOC/SE will conduct flight, ground, and weapons safety
   assessments and SAVs IAW AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
   AF Reserve Command will conduct safety inspections of AF Reserve units. Safety
   inspections for ANG units will be conducted by the NGB as part of the Environmental,
   Safety, and Occupational Health Compliance Assessment Management Program.
   2.3.9. Energy, Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health Compliance Assessment
   Management Program (EESOHCAMP). HQ AFSOC/CE is OPR and will coordinate with
   HQ AFSOC/SE and HQ AFSOC/SG the conduct of the EESOHCAMP assessments of
   AFSOC units. The EESOHCAMP is an assessment that monitors overall compliance with
   governmental and departmental directives that encompass Occupational Health,
   Environmental, and Ground and Weapons Safety. Flight Safety, though not part of
   EESOHCAMP, may take part in a combined inspection for units with a flying mission. IAW
   AFI 90-201, ANG Supplement, The Inspection System, the ANG conducts the
   EESOHCAMP inspections for ANG units. AFSOC/IG inspections will not duplicate ANG
   EESOHCAMP inspection elements. AFSOC/IG should arrange to receive a copy of the most
   recent ANG EESOHCAMP report and review the status of discrepancies noted in the ANG
   EESOHCAMP report.
   2.3.10. Self Inspection. Self inspection (SI) provides commanders with a tool for internal
   assessment of unit health and complements external assessments. AFSOC SI program
   guidance is in Chapter 5 of this instruction.
   2.3.11. Intelligence Standardization and Evaluation Visit (ISEV). HQ AFSOC/A2 ensures
   subordinate units are in compliance with AF instructions, MDS-specific grading criteria and
   HHQ guidance IAW AFSOC Supplement to AFI 14-202, Volume 1, Intelligence Training,
   and Volume 2, Intelligence Standardization/Evaluation Program.
2.4. The AFSOC/IG inspection team. For most inspections, the number of inspectors required
exceeds the manning of the AFSOC/IG directorate. Therefore, HQ AFSOC or field units will
augment the inspection team. HQ AFSOC/IG will normally provide the inspection team chief
and core support staff for IG conducted inspections.
   2.4.1. Augmenting the IG Team. HQ AFSOC directorates and field units will, as inspection
   or visit requirements dictate, provide qualified personnel to augment inspection teams.
   Qualified personnel are subject matter experts recommended by the appropriate HQ AFSOC
   functional director. HQ AFSOC/IG, as required, will provide Temporary Duty (TDY) funds
   for augmentees. Augmentation requests will be sent directly from HQ AFSOC/IG to other
   HQ AFSOC directorates. The minimum grade for an augmentee is master sergeant (E-7).
   On a case-by-case basis, a technical sergeant (E-6) assigned to HQ AFSOC can augment the
   inspection team upon approval from the HQ AFSOC/IGI. Once augmentation requirements
   have been tasked, HQ AFSOC/IG will coordinate directly with the supporting directorates or
   unit(s). Requested ANG and AFRC augmentation will be coordinated with HQ NGB-IG and
   HQ AFRC/IG respectively.
 14                                                             AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


   2.4.2. IG Team Clearances. HQ AFSOC/IG team orders contain each individual’s security
   clearance. At the start of each inspection, IG team entry access listings (EAL) are provided to
   the unit commander or base command post representative. It is the inspected unit’s
   responsibility to ensure adequate copies of the IG team EAL are distributed to appropriate
   offices and proper access is granted to IG team members.
   2.4.3. IG Support Requirements. Upon notification of an inspection, the inspected unit’s
   commander will provide HQ AFSOC/IG with a single Point of Contact (POC). The POC
   will contact the HQ AFSOC/IG inspection planner to determine detailed support
   requirements. Some requirements may not be identified until after team arrival; however,
   Attachment 2 provides basic information for planning purposes. The AFSOC IG planner(s)
   will define specific requirements for each inspection.
2.5. Inspector General Evaluation Management System (IGEMS).
   2.5.1. Description. An unclassified web based software program serving as an inspection
   tool comprised of planning, executing, reporting, and corrective action management. In
   addition, IGEMS provides HQ AFSOC/IG with the capability to gather trend data on a
   multitude of inspection variables. If the need arises for classified reporting, HQ AFSOC/IG
   will use classified reporting channels.
   2.5.2. Phased Implementation. IGEMS will be phased for implementation on a schedule to
   be determined in coordination with SAF/IGI and MAJCOM/IGs.
   2.5.3. Access management. Access to IGEMS will be administered by the HQ AFSOC/IG
   IGEMS Administrators.
   2.5.4. Trend Reports. HQ AFSOC/IG will use IGEMS to record trend data of inspection
   results that will be available for extract by SAF/IG.
2.6. Inspection Reports. At the conclusion of a formal inspection conducted by HQ
AFSOC/IG, a report will be provided to the AFSOC/CC and the inspected unit. Inspection
reports are posted on the HQ AFSOC/IG SIPRNET site and emailed to SAF/IGI. Inspection
reports for ANG units will be e-mailed via SIPR to NGB-IGD. Contact NGB-IGD at
ngbigd@ng.army.mil to obtain current NGB-IGD SIPR account. The HQ AFSOC/IG will
normally brief inspection results to the unit at the conclusion of the inspection. The HQ
AFSOC/IG will also normally brief the AFSOC/CC and staff after returning from the inspection.
The briefing will include repeat findings, ongoing problems, and other observations by the HQ
AFSOC/IG.
   2.6.1. Inspection reports will be maintained in accordance with the Air Force Records
   Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), T 90-02,
   Special Management – Inspection Records: Destroy 10 years after completion of subject
   inspection.
2.7. Inspection Write-ups. For CIs, ORIs and additional inspections, inspection reports will
only include write-ups categorized as Strengths, Deficiencies, and Recommended Improvement
Areas (RIA). RIAs will not be used to document procedural deviations or non-compliance; they
are only used to recommend a more efficient or effective course of action.
   2.7.1. Deficiency write-ups identified by the HQ AFSOC/IG will contain:
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                      15


     2.7.1.1. Deficiency Number. A unique tracking number developed by combining the
     inspected unit designation, type inspection (i.e. ORI, CI), year (i.e. 09), the AFSOC
     directorate responsible for the policy area, and two-digit sequence number of the
     deficiency for directorate (i.e. 1SOW-CI09-A601).
     2.7.1.2. Short Title (optional). A short (one-line) summary/description of the deficiency.
     2.7.1.3. Detail. Describe, in sufficient detail, the deficiency and contextual facts as
     necessary to clearly convey the defect requiring resolution. The written description alone
     should be adequate for the inspected party to begin corrective action planning.
     2.7.1.4. Severity. A deficiency severity of Critical, Significant, or Minor.
     2.7.1.5. Reference(s) to the applicable instruction, technical order, policy letter, or other
     source documentation.
     2.7.1.6. Impact. For critical deficiencies address impact of continued deviation or non-
     compliance.
     2.7.1.7. HQ AFSOC OPR. The AFSOC functional OPR responsible for policy related to
     the deficiency (three or four letter office symbol).
     2.7.1.8. OCR. Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR), if applicable. The AFSOC
     functional OCR, and/or external functional OCR responsible for collateral policy related
     to the deficiency (three or four letter office symbol). OCR use commonly occurs if a
     deficiency is cross functional in nature, impacts a host/tenant relationship, or has an ARC
     interrelated issue.
     2.7.1.9. Corrective Action OPR. The unit Corrective Action OPR office symbol
     (typically a squadron commander or equivalent) that is responsible for oversight of the
     corrective action, determining the deficiency code(s), and recommending closure when
     corrective action is complete. In instances where corrective action responsibility is
     assigned to both the host and tenant unit (or supported and supporting unit), HQ
     AFSOC/IG will also assign both a Corrective Action OPR and a Corrective Action OCR.
     A Corrective Action OCR also may be identified if a deficiency is cross functional and
     requires action by more than one organization within a unit.
     2.7.1.10. Closing Authority. The deficiency closing authority (typically the wing
     commander or equivalent for minor deficiencies or the HQ AFSOC/IG for major and
     critical deficiencies). The closing authority is responsible for reviewing deficiency
     corrective actions for appropriateness prior to closure.
  2.7.2. External/ HHQ/Support Agency deficiencies.
     2.7.2.1. Deficiencies that involve hosts/tenants outside the inspected unit’s chain-of-
     command, higher headquarters (HHQ), other MAJCOMs, or non-AF entities will be
     categorized as HHQ/Support Agency Deficiencies.
     2.7.2.2. Deficiencies External to Inspected Unit. When the HQ AFSOC/IG team assigns
     a deficiency to an organization outside AFSOC, the inspecting team will notify the
     owning MAJCOM/IG of the deficiency (or SAF/IGI for HAF or non-AF deficiencies)
     and courtesy copy both the tenant and host base units. Once notified, the owning IG is
     responsible for tracking status and notifying the HQ AFSOC/IG when closed IAW AFI
16                                                             AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


     90-201. In instances where the inspection involves associate units, coordination between
     the associated and associating MAJCOM/IGs on how deficiencies are assigned, assessed,
     and resolved will be essential to ensuring timely resolution.
  2.7.3. Reporting Instructions. The inspected unit will provide an initial corrective action
  plans/matrix (spreadsheet) NLT 60 days after the final inspection report is published to the
  HQ AFSOC/IG Analysis Team (AFSOC.IG.ANALYSIS@hurlburt.af.mil.) The inspected
  unit will provide status updates on open deficiencies (those not fully corrected and closed) to
  HQ AFSOC/IGI quarterly by 31 Jan, 30 Apr, 31 Jul, and 31 Oct until all deficiencies are
  closed. The minimum information covered in the corrective action matrix consists of the
  open deficiencies and the estimated completion date for each.
  2.7.4. Deficiency corrective action procedures.
     2.7.4.1. The HQ AFSOC/IG will track all deficiencies and provide the inspected unit
     with reply instructions as part of the final report.
     2.7.4.2. The AFSOC/IG, after coordinating review by the appropriate AFSOC FAM(s),
     will close all critical and significant unit-level and AFSOC-level deficiencies. These
     deficiencies will be inspected during the unit’s next scheduled inspection.
     2.7.4.3. The HQ AFSOC/IG will determine if Minor deficiencies assessed to the
     inspected unit will be closed at the unit-level or by the HQ AFSOC/IG. These
     deficiencies will be inspected during the unit’s next scheduled inspection. Minor
     deficiencies assessed to the AFSOC-level will be closed by the HQ AFSOC/IG.
     2.7.4.4. The HQ AFSOC/IG will forward all HAF-level actionable deficiencies to
     SAF/IGI for processing. SAF/IGI, after review and coordination by the responsible HAF
     functional(s), will close HAF-level deficiencies in collaboration with the HQ AFSOC/IG
     IAW AFI 90201.
     2.7.4.5. AFSOC FAMs and the HQ AFSOC/IG will review corrective actions for
     appropriateness prior to closure when the HQ AFSOC/IG is the Closing Authority. Units
     may request assistance from the HQ AFSOC OPR to determine/develop corrective
     actions. Units may be required to provide problem solving documentation for these
     deficiencies.
     2.7.4.6. Not in Compliance or Unsatisfactory Grade. The IG will conduct a reinspection
     of any graded area(s) found to be Not in Compliance for CIs or Unsatisfactory for ORIs
     once the unit has resolved and submitted a recommendation for closure to the IG for all
     deficiencies in the graded area(s). The re-inspection will be conducted NO EARLIER
     than 6 MONTHS after the initial inspection.
     2.7.4.7. The unit will correct deficiencies for which they are identified as the Corrective
     Action OPR. Deficiencies will be inspected during the unit’s next scheduled inspection.
     2.7.4.8. The unit Corrective Action OPR will assign a deficiency code(s) and determine
     appropriate corrective action(s) for each deficiency as part of the deficiency corrective
     action process. Use deficiency codes from AFI 90201, Table 2.1., Deficiency Codes and
     Explanations. Units are encouraged to coordinate their corrective actions with the
     appropriate wing FAM and/or HQ AFSOC FAM identified as HQ AFSOC OPR.
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                         17


     2.7.4.9. Basic responsibility for problem solving and the corrective action process resides
     at the lowest appropriate command level; normally the Corrective Action OPR. Problem
     solving should be applied through the AF eight-step problem solving model as outlined in
     the AFSO21 Playbook (or SAF/SO approved publication) to assist in identifying root
     causes and solutions to deficiencies.
     2.7.4.10. For each deficiency, use the AFSOC Form 18, Deficiency Corrective Action
     Staffing, to document the deficiency code(s) and corrective action(s) and route the
     deficiency for closure with the Closing Authority identified in the deficiency write-up.
  2.7.5. AFSOC Form 18, Deficiency Corrective Action Staffing, Procedures (corrective
  action process).
     2.7.5.1. The AFSOC Form 18 will be used to describe deficiency corrective actions and
     coordinate closure.
     2.7.5.2. The AFSOC Form 18 actions. The HQ AFSOC/IGI inspection support manager
     (ISM) will manage completion of Section I of AFSOC Form 18 with deficiency
     information from the inspection report. The ISM will also manage completion of the
     Section II, Corrective Action OPR (office symbol only), and all subsequent coordinating
     offices in Section III (office symbols only). The coordinating process will normally
     follow the chain of command until the highest commander in the inspected unit is
     reached. The next coordinating officer will be the AFSOC Director for the deficiency
     OPR. The final coordinating officer will be the HQ AFSOC/IGI for Minor deficiencies
     or the HQ AFSOC/IG for Significant and Critical deficiencies. For example, the lowest
     level deficiency action officer in section II would normally be a squadron commander.
     The coordinating officers in section III would then be the corresponding group
     commander, the wing commander, the appropriate AFSOC director (i.e. HQ
     AFSOC/A1), then the HQ AFSOC/IG. For minor findings closed by the inspected unit,
     the HQ AFSOC/IGI is for acknowledgment only (for tracking purposes).
     2.7.5.3. Units will designate a Corrective Action Coordinating POC(s) to facilitate
     coordination of corrective action plans and AFSOC Form 18 processing within the unit
     and between the unit and HQ AFSOC/IG. The Corrective Action Coordinating POC is
     normally the wing IG or XP, for units without an IG or XP, the inspected unit executive
     officer (or other individual designated by the unit).
     2.7.5.4. The HQ AFSOC/IGI Analysis Team will forward all AFSOC Forms 18 and
     handling instructions to the inspected unit for processing.
     2.7.5.5. Unit Corrective Action OPRs Form 18 actions. The deficiency Corrective
     Action OPR documents the corrective action(s) accomplished and identifies the
     deficiency cause code(s) from Table 2.1. in Section II and digitally signs the Form 18.
     2.7.5.6. The unit Corrective Action Coordinating POC(s) forwards all completed Forms
     18 (signed by the unit CC) to the HQ AFSOC/IG Analysis Team
     (AFSOC.IG.ANALYSIS@hurlburt.af.mil). The HQ AFSOC/IG Analysis Team will
     coordinate all Forms 18 within Headquarters AFSOC to close each deficiency.
  2.7.6. The deficiency codes listed in Table 2.1. apply to all inspections listed in this AFI.

2.8. AF Special Interest Item (SII) Program.
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                      21


   2.8.1. Purpose. SIIs provide a means to focus management attention and/or gather data to
   evaluate the status of specific programs and conditions in the field requiring AF senior leader
   attention. SIIs are used by HAF functional staffs to make policy adjustments and enhance
   decision making. Active SIIs should not exceed more than five at any given time.
   2.8.2. Responsibilities.
       2.8.2.1. SAF/IGI, IAW AFI 90-201, manages the AF SII program by coordinating AF
       SII topic proposals, obtaining SAF/IG approval, distributes approved AF SII to
       MAJCOM/IGs, compiles and forwards SII data to the sponsoring agency.
       2.8.2.2. SII Sponsors. Only HAF functionals may sponsor SIIs IAW AFI 90-201.
       Proposed SII topics may be initiated at any level but must be submitted by the
       appropriate HAF functional to SAF/IGI at safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. Submit
       SII topic proposals in the format provided on the SAF/IGI Community of Practice (CoP).
       2.8.2.3. HQ AFSOC/IG.
          2.8.2.3.1. SII Inspections.     Inspect all applicable active SIIs during formal
          inspections. Units need only be inspected and reported once during the SII’s active
          period. For AFSOC gained units, the HQ AFSOC/IG will coordinate with owning IG
          prior to conducting SII inspections on gained units. Document the results of SII
          inspections as a separate section of the final inspection report.
          2.8.2.3.2. SII Reports. Consolidate SII inspection results and report quarterly to
          SAF/IGI at safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. Provide a summary of units
          inspected, locations, dates of inspection, and electronic extract of the SII portion of
          the final inspection report. Include unit SII self inspection results NLT the third
          quarter report. IG remarks are important to the SII process and should be annotated
          IAW specific instructions attached to each SII.
       2.8.2.4. Wing/Unit. Obtain SII information via HQ AFSOC/IG portal page or SAF/IGI
       CoP. Wings/units not inspected during the active period of an SII will conduct a one-
       time self inspection and report results to HQ AFSOC/IG.
   2.8.3. Rating. If rating is required as part of the SII, the scale will be specified in the SII
   instructions.
   2.8.4. Command Interest Items (CII). The HQ AFSOC/IG will ensure that AFSOC CIIs do
   not conflict with AF SIIs.
2.9. IG Inspector Eligibility, Training and Certification.
   2.9.1. Eligibility. Officer inspectors should be senior captains (captains with more than 7
   years commissioned service) or above. Enlisted inspectors must be 7-level or above and be
   SNCOs (TSgts will be considered on a case-by-case basis only). All inspectors must have
   knowledge, experience, and maturity commensurate with the duties required to conduct
   inspections.
   2.9.2. Mandatory Training. All IG team members will complete the USAF Inspectors
   Course within 90 days of assignment to the HQ AFSOC/IG. While designed and required for
   newly assigned MAJCOM/IG team members, other HQ AFSOC inspectors and Exercise

      SAF/IGI NLT 01 September using the course request template on the SAF/IGI CoP.
      2.9.2.2. HQ AFSOC/IG-Specific Training. HQ AFSOC/IGI will develop and provide all
      required specialized team, functional area, host-nation, and MAJCOM-specific training.
      2.9.2.3. For required inspector training prior to assessing contractor functions see
      paragraph 2.1.10.3.
   2.9.3. Recurring Training. All AFSOC Inspectors will re-accomplish mandatory training
   NLT 48 months after certification.
   2.9.4. Certification. HQ AFSOC/IG, at a minimum, will certify all inspectors. Inspector
   certification to conduct inspections requires completion of mandatory and MAJCOM-
   specific training, as well as a field observation. Field observation requirement is a minimum
   of one over-the-shoulder inspection by a certified inspector.
2.10. Inspection Report Handling.
   2.10.1. Classification. Review all reports prior to publication to ensure they are properly
   classified and marked IAW DOD 5200.1-R, and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
   Management.

   Use Only (FOUO)" IAW DOD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement.
   2.10.3. Releasability. AF inspection reports, related materials and drafts are official
   government documents and the AF controls their distribution. DOD members, DOD
   contractors, consultants, and grantees are permitted access to inspection reports IAW DOD
   Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement. Non-DOD parties requesting inspection reports
   should be referred to the appropriate Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) office.
      2.10.3.1. Release Determination Authority. Before release outside DOD, FOIA offices
      will receive a final release determination from SAF/IGI for any inspection reports.
      2.10.3.2. Release Within DOD. HQ AFSOC/IG is authorized to release inspection
      reports, in whole or in part, within DOD. Courtesy copy SAF/IGI on any release outside
      the AF.
      2.10.3.3. Release of Inspection Summary to Media. An inspection summary may be
      released for inclusion in response to media queries or for internal information. The
      summary will be limited to the overall rating, inspection process/definition and, if
      desired, personal comments by the commander (e.g. general laudatory comments,
      perception of inspection process). The published summary will not contain detailed
      information (e.g. sub-area ratings, a list of individuals recognized by the IG, specific
      deficiencies, or specific ratings for inspection criteria).
      2.10.3.4. Releasability Statement. The following statement must appear on the cover and
      each page of the report as well as in any transmission, presentation, or document
      containing protected IG material: ―For Official Use Only. This report may be protected
      from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Do not release or publish, in
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                    23


      whole or in part, outside official DOD channels without express approval of the Director,
      SAF/IGI.‖ Include similar statements on reports of inspections conducted jointly with
      inspection teams from other DOD agencies.
      2.10.3.5. Inspection Outbrief. Unit outbriefs are considered a version of the inspection
      report and consequently fall within releasability restrictions. DOD members, DOD
      contractors, consultants, and grantees are permitted to attend inspection outbriefs at the
      discretion of the installation/wing commander. Community leaders and general public
      are not authorized access to inspection results, to include outbriefs, except as permitted
      by IAW DOD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement (see paragraph 2.9.3.)
   2.10.4. Distribution.    MAJCOM/IGs will send an UNCLAS email to
   safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil or a CLASSIFIED (up to SECRET) email to
   safigi@af.pentagon.smil.mil:
      2.10.4.1. NLT 15 days of IG team departing the inspected unit, send an executive
      summary of the inspection to include overall rating, MGA ratings, and all Critical
      deficiencies.
      2.10.4.2. NLT 30 days of IG team departing inspected unit, send an electronic version of
      the final IG inspection report. If the inspection report is produced in IGEMS, sending an
      electronic version is not required. Availability of reports on AFSOC internet sites does
      not satisfy this requirement.
2.11. Gatekeeper Functions.
   2.11.1. AF Gatekeeper. IAW AFI 90-201, AFIA Gatekeeper, in coordination with SAF/IGI,
   serves as the AF focal point for notification of HAF and non-AF assessments and relays visit
   notifications. AFIA Gatekeeper assists MAJCOM Gatekeepers in de-conflicting schedules
   as required.
   2.11.2. The HQ AFSOC/IG Gatekeeper is the overall AFSOC Gatekeeper. The HQ
   AFSOC/IG Gatekeeper serves as the focal point for notification of visits designed to inspect,
   assess, or evaluate AFSOC units. The HQ AFSOC/IG Gatekeeper assists in de-confliction of
   visits to AFSOC units or AFSOC gained units with owning MAJCOM Gatekeeper, as
   required.     The AFSOC Gatekeeper does not have authority to deny access to
   inspectors/auditors from agencies outside AFSOC. If required, the AFIA Gatekeeper will
   assist with resolving conflicts.
      2.11.2.1. HQ AFSOC/IG Gatekeeper will submit an annual inspection schedule update to
      AFIA Gatekeeper NLT the last day of each quarter. Quarterly, the AFIA Gatekeeper will
      forward a consolidated inspection schedule to MAJCOM/IGs, SAF/IGI, and AFSC/SEW.
      HQ AFSOC/IG Gatekeeper will distribute inspection schedules on a need-to-know basis.
      2.11.2.2. HQ AFSOC/IG Gatekeeper will update and forward the 6-month Gatekeeper
      calendar for the AFSOC/CC staff meeting by the third Thursday of each month.
      2.11.2.3. HQ AFSOC/IG Gatekeeper will brief HQ AFSOC/IG during weekly staff
      meetings.
      2.11.2.4. HQ AFSOC/IG Gatekeeper will update the master Gatekeeper long-term
      calendar located on the unclassified HQ AFSOC/IG SharePoint site.

                               COMPLIANCE INSPECTION (CI)

3.1. Execution. CIs are conducted to assess areas mandated by law as well as mission areas that
are critical or important to the health and performance of organizations. Unit failure to comply
with the established directives in these areas could result in legal liabilities, penalties, or mission
impact. At a minimum, CIs will be conducted on all wing/wing equivalent units (over-seas
Special Operations Groups) at an interval of no more than 60 months. AFSOC/CC approval is
required to exceed the 60-month inspection interval. The HQ AFSOC/IG will notify SAF/IG
when a unit will exceed the inspection interval and will provide anticipated inspection date(s).
   3.1.1. The HQ AFSOC/IG intends to conduct CIs approximately every three years (four
   years for AFSOC-gained ANG units) and not normally in conjunction with an Operational
   Readiness Inspection (ORI). However, the AFSOC/CC can direct a CI of active units at
   anytime. HQ AFSOC/IG will coordinate visits of AFSOC-gained ANG units with National
   Guard Bureau (NGB) IG and the unit prior to the visit. AF Reserve Command (AFRC)
   conducts CIs of AFSOC-gained AF Reserve units. The CI schedule is published in the HQ
   AFSOC/IG Inspection/Gatekeeper calendar.
   3.1.2. Applicable Air Force SIIs, AFSOC CIIs, and ANG CIIs will be assessed during CIs,
   and will be incorporated into the CI report.
   3.1.3. AFSOC-specified compliance MGAs and Sub-areas. AFSOC directors may propose
   additional areas for inspection using the sample request at Attachment 3. The directorate will
   provide an inspection checklist for the proposed additional compliance MGAs and Sub-areas.
   All approved AFSOC-specific compliance areas will be included in this chapter.
   3.1.4. Inspection Out-brief. The IG will deliver the final inspection report and conduct an
   out-brief with the commander of the inspected unit and essential unit personnel upon
   completion of the inspection.
3.2. CI Rating. Three-tier rating (e.g., IN COMPLIANCE / IN COMPLIANCE WITH
COMMENTS / NOT IN COMPLIANCE) will be used to assess each compliance area. It is not
the intent of this inspection to specifically rate organizations; the intent is to rate programmatic
compliance.
3.3. AF Compliance MGAs and Sub-areas. Air Force Compliance MGAs represent key
processes, procedures, and requirements based on public law, executive orders, DOD, AF,
MAJCOM, and ARC directives and instructions. AFSOC may supplement the requirements of
AF MGAs and add AFSOC-specific MGAs. Air Force and AFSOC MGAs are organized
according to the AFSOC functional policy origin/oversight for each MGA. It is not the intent of
this instruction to inspect units according to the numbered Air Staff construct but rather to better
align inspection requirements with functional responsibilities and guidance. MGAs are
delineated with a bold font title and sub-areas are delineated with underline in this chapter.
AFSOC supplemental Compliance MGAs are delineated with (AFSOC) following the MGA
title.

                   OPERATIONAL READINESS INSPECTION (ORI)

4.1. Execution. ORIs evaluate and measure the ability of units to perform their wartime,
contingency, or force sustainment missions. For maximum effectiveness in assessing operational
readiness, all readiness MGAs should be assessed during the same visit. However, if required to
divide the inspection into separate visits, the inspection will consist of two phases. Phase I
evaluates the unit’s transition from peacetime readiness and the unit's ability to maintain and
sustain essential home station missions during and after the deployment of forces and includes
the MGA of Positioning the Force.              Phase II evaluates the unit’s ability to meet
wartime/contingency taskings through the MGAs of Employing the Force, Sustaining the Force,
and Ability to Survive and Operate (ATSO). Within the parameters set by the IG, wing
commanders may request appropriate unit activity be observed by the IG to receive credit for
Phase I or Phase II requirements. At a minimum, ORIs will be conducted on all wing/wing
equivalent units with a wartime, contingency, or force sustainment mission at an interval of no
more than 60 months. AFSOC/CC approval is required to exceed the 60-month inspection
interval. HQ AFSOC/IG will notify SAF/IG when a unit will exceed the inspection interval and
will provide anticipated inspection date (s). Every AFSOC unit with assigned Unit Type Codes
(UTC) is eligible for ORI tasking. Normally, AFSOC active duty units receive an ORI every
three years and AFSOC gained AFRC/ANG units every four years. When directed by
AFSOC/CC, units may receive an ORI regardless of their reported combat capability (coordinate
with NGB/IGD for ANG units reporting less than C-3 status). Units may receive full or partial
ORI credit when deployed to a Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) or theaterdirected contingency
operation. Refer to chapter five of this instruction for more information.
   4.1.1. Scenarios. IG teams will attempt to create a realistic environment for evaluation while
   ensuring safety is not compromised.          ORI scenarios evaluate garrison operations,
   contingency response (from both garrison and continuity of operations [COOP] location),
   and sustained performance. When possible, combine ORI scenarios with existing exercises,
   contingency events, or other AFSOC scenarios.
   4.1.2. Performance. The IG team will focus on mission performance. Academic testing will
   not be used as a primary measure of readiness unless it serves a specific inspection objective
   or hands-on performance cannot be observed.
   4.1.3. HQ AFSOC/IG evaluates unit readiness using Mission Essential Tasks, Design
   Operational Capability (DOC) statements, UTC mission capability statements, and governing
   instructions. Attachment 7 of this instruction contains common areas and tasks normally
   inspected during AFSOC ORIs. This information is provided for reference only does not
   limit the scope of the inspection. Functional area inspectors are encouraged to create
   inspection guides to aid in the conduct of the inspection. Inspected units should not use these
   functional area guides for inspection preparation, but should train to wartime tasking.
   Throughout the inspection, the decision-making process is observed. Commander, staff and
   individual decision making opportunities presented by the ORI should not be inhibited by an
   event-driven checklist.
40                                                            AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


  4.1.4. Inspected units will be evaluated on OPSEC, COMSEC, and COMPUSEC practices
  and use of available secure systems throughout the inspection. HQ AFSOC/IG may request
  outside agency support to assist this evaluation.
  4.1.5. Safety and operational risk management (ORM) awareness are evaluated throughout
  the ORI. Unit commanders may deviate from any part of the ORI if conditions compromise
  safety. Advise the functional area inspector of the reasons for the deviation and notify the
  inspection team chief in writing using AFSOC Form 19, Inspection Communication.
  4.1.6. ORI Vehicle. The ORI vehicle is the exercise chosen to host the ORI. The preferred
  ORI vehicle is a JCS sponsored exercise. In cases where a JCS exercise is not available, the
  IG may generate an IG exercise (IGX) to serve as the ORI vehicle. If the selected ORI
  vehicle does not engage required inspection activities, HQ AFSOC/IG may supplement the
  ORI by observing other unit exercises and/or deployments. The IG normally initiates ORI
  vehicle selection two years from the inspected unit’s projected ORI.
  4.1.7. ORI Planning. If the ORI vehicle is a JCS or equivalent exercise, IG planners will
  coordinate with the host agency to attend conferences and ensure ORI objectives are
  integrated into the exercise concept. If the ORI vehicle is an IGX, the IG will oversee the
  planning process through a series of exercise conferences. IG planners will attend these
  conferences to provide assistance; however, unit trusted agents are responsible for the
  conduct of detailed exercise planning. If elements of the inspected unit are not tasked within
  the exercise, the IG will determine the best method for their inspection. The IG will
  coordinate with the inspected unit to determine the conference schedule and required
  attendees. A typical planning timeline for an IGX is as follows:
     4.1.7.1. The Initial Planning Conference (IPC) normally takes place 12-10 months prior
     to the scheduled inspection. Primary objectives of the IPC are to establish planning
     relationships, define level-of-effort (i.e., inspectable UTCs/force package), identify
     support requirements, and establish planning milestones.
     4.1.7.2. The Main Planning Conference (MPC) normally takes place six months prior to
     the scheduled inspection. Primary MPC objectives include building detailed mission
     profiles for tasked operations (master mission matrix), developing the ORI timeline and
     schedule of events, defining Exercise Control Group (ECG) connectivity, tasks, and
     manning requirements, identifying inspected unit C2 processes and responsibilities, and
     reviewing the ORI ground rules and simulation package.
     4.1.7.3. The Final Planning Conference (FPC) normally takes place two prior to the
     scheduled ORI. Primary objectives of the FPC are to verify completion of planning
     milestones, ensure exercise support agreements are ready to execute, and to synchronize
     (wargame) the master mission matrix against the exercise scenario/timeline.
     4.1.7.4. The Pre-Deployment Site Survey (PDSS) normally takes place following the
     MPC. Primary objective of the PDSS is to map exercise play areas, define and
     coordinate for exercise support requirements, and identify infrastructure and support
     shortfalls that may impact.
     4.1.7.5. The Scripting Conference(s) normally takes place following the MPC. Primary
     objective of the Scripting Conference is to develop the exercise scenario and supporting
     intelligence message traffic, maps, and associated documentation.
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                      41


  4.1.8. Trusted Agents. The IG depends on inspected unit planners to conduct detailed ORI
  planning. Inspected unit planners are considered trusted agents due to the sensitive nature of
  the information they are exposed to during ORI planning. Trusted agents are normally made
  available to support the entire planning process. If required, they also assist during execution
  as members of the ECG. IG planners will coordinate trusted agent requirements with the
  inspected unit prior to the IPC. The IG provides training to ensure trusted agents understand
  their responsibilities to the IG and ORI planning process.
  4.1.9. ORI Initiation. In most cases, the ORI begins immediately following the formal in
  brief. ORI initiation may or may not coincide with exercise messages.
  4.1.10. Prior to ORI initiation, commanders should posture their forces based on the
  intelligence buildup and exercise development. Depending on the exercise scenario, units
  will normally receive scenario development messages approximately 30 days from
  execution. Positioning the Force is normally executed real-time using a short-notice
  contingency response scenario.
  4.1.11. All personnel assigned and available for duty are eligible for ORI tasking. Aircraft,
  equipment, and personnel away from home station on HHQ directed missions are considered
  deployed, but may be used for ORI tasking depending on the scenario and approval from the
  controlling agency. Units should simulate recall of personnel on leave or on TDY for an
  ORI.
  4.1.12. Communications:
     4.1.12.1. HQ AFSOC/IG expects units to demonstrate realistic use of C2 channels. In
     cases when the IG role-plays the HHQ element, units should take all preliminary steps
     necessary (e.g., draft messages, etc.) when relaying requests to the IG.
     4.1.12.2. During ORI execution the primary mode of communication between the IG and
     the inspected unit is via AFSOC Form 19, Inspection Communication,(see attachment 8).
     Normally, the IG team chief will act on coordinated requests from the unit. Submit the
     AFSOC Form 19 IAW procedures outlined in the applicable ORI ground rules.
  4.1.13. Do not compromise safety during IG-directed exercises. Do not take actions that
  may result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment, aircraft, or property. Actual
  emergencies take immediate precedence over any exercise event. Security forces will not be
  delayed, evacuated, or otherwise prevented from performing their real-world security mission
  or responding to actual situations. The IG will not confront unit members with situations that
  could be interpreted as actual hostile actions. Under no circumstances should any IG team
  member attempt to compromise real world security for the purpose of conducting exercises.
  4.1.14. Simulations or substitutions are approved only when it is impossible or impractical to
  perform actual procedures or use specified equipment. Coordinate all simulations not
  expressly authorized by exercise implementing instructions, ORI ground rules, or the
  simulation package with the IG prior to accomplishment. During ORI execution, submit new
  simulation requests via AFSOC Form 19, Inspection Communication. All requests for
  simulations should answer the following questions:
     4.1.14.1. WHAT? -- Describe the simulated task or equipment.
     4.1.14.2. HOW? -- Describe how you will simulate the task.
42                                                            AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


     4.1.14.3. WHY? -- Provide a brief explanation of the need for simulation and the impact
     if the simulation request is disapproved.
  4.1.15. Message Preparation and Handling.
     4.1.15.1. Deliver and transmit all exercise messages required by the supported exercise.
     Do not transmit messages that are solely for IG information.
     4.1.15.2. Provide a copy of all outgoing messages to the IG Team Chief.
     4.1.15.3. Send the CAT activation, deactivation, Situation Report (SITREP) and real-
     world Operations Report (OPREP-3) messages to all appropriate agencies.
     4.1.15.4. Simulate and log all required off base communication. Preface all
     communications with the words, "EXERCISE, EXERCISE, EXERCISE" and refer to
     events as "simulated."
  4.1.16. ORI Outbrief. Depending upon the unit and scope of the inspection, the ORI
  outbrief can range from a table-top briefing with the inspected unit commander and key staff,
  to a more formal presentation open to the entire inspected unit population. If the more
  formal platform is selected, the HQ AFSOC/IG will debrief the inspected unit commander
  prior to the presentation.
  4.1.17. Responsibilities.
     4.1.17.1. HQ AFSOC will:

4.2. ORI Rating. Overall inspection performance, readiness MGAs, and sub-areas will be rated
using the five-tier scale Outstanding, Excellent, satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory.
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                     45


   4.2.1. The ORI grading process emphasizes safe mission accomplishment in accordance
   with established tactics, techniques, and procedures. Major safety violations will negatively
   impact the readiness MGAs/sub-area grade. In addition, safety violations may result in the
   IG declaring a sortie unreliable when a safety violation occurs during aircraft operations.
   Aircraft, personnel, and equipment may be declared out-of-play if involved in a major safety
   violation.
   4.2.2. When an inspected unit is rated unsatisfactory, provisions of Joint Pub 1-03.3, Joint
   Reporting System (JRS), Status of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS), apply.
4.3. AF Readiness MGAs and Sub-areas. Units with a wartime or contingency mission will
be rated in four MGAs: Positioning the Force, Employing the Force, Sustaining the Force, and
ATSO in a hostile environment and/or contaminated Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
Nuclear (CBRN) environment. Conduct Special Operations Liaison Element (SOLE) ORIs
using applicable guidance in Attachment 6.
4.4. Positioning the Force. Positioning the force is defined as the deployment, reception, and
beddown of tailored and prioritized forces. Includes all actions required to transition from
peacetime to contingency operations or wartime posture, and applies to all units unless otherwise
specified. Evaluate the unit's ability to command, control, and execute assigned tasks while
continuing its home station mission (when applicable). Evaluate readiness posture changes,
aircraft generation, and deployment operations, to include the handling, storage, authorization,
and transportation of material, weapons, munitions, and classified information.
   4.4.1. Command and Control (C2). Evaluate the effectiveness of the initial response
   actions performed by the Installation Control Center (ICC) and other wing C2
   agencies/elements (command post, Installation Deployment Readiness Center (IDRC) and
   Unit Control Centers (UCC), etc).
       4.4.1.1. Evaluate CP's and Commander's Senior Staff procedures for receiving
       processing and disseminating emergency action messages (EAM) IAW HHQ
       requirements as applicable.

       201.
       4.4.1.3. For all C2 functions consider; decision making, direction, coordination, and
       reporting. Consider the interaction between unit command functions, subordinate units,
       and HHQ organizations. Consider coordination between unit, base, and tenant
       organizations (when applicable). Consider the unit's protection of classified information,
       operational plans and capabilities. Evaluate overall C2 of deployment actions. See
       Attachment X for C2 subareas and commonly inspected tasks.
   4.4.2. Preparing for Operations.
       4.4.2.1. Evaluate weapon system generation and deployment. Tasked units must
       demonstrate the ability to generate/launch UTC authorized or possessed aircraft;
       whichever is less, within the times specified in their DOC statement or most stringent
       tasking as specified by the IG. The IG evaluates units without an aviation mobility or
       generation requirement during employment operations only. Aircraft generation timing
       begins at X-hour unless otherwise specified by the IG. Aircraft will be inspected to
 46                                                             AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011

       management, immunizations, prophylaxis distribution, and medical intelligence briefing.
       4.4.3.5. Evaluate the unit's ability to implement the local deployment plan in response to
       the deployment tasking. This process covers planning and all necessary actions for air or
       surface movement of personnel, equipment, and consumables deploying in support of an
       OPLAN or contingency tasking. Deployment timing begins upon the establishment of an
       X-hour by the IG which normally coincides with the receipt of the Deployment Order.
       Inspected units will use Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES) and
       Deliberate Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) to the maximum
       extent practical. Units should be prepared to deploy any UTC identified in the AFSOC
       portion of the Air Force-Wide UTC Summary (AFWUS). See Attachment 7 for
       Deployment Planning/Processing sub-areas and commonly inspected tasks.
   4.4.4. Reception and Beddown. Assess unit’s ability to receive and beddown forces for
   personnel accountability, equipment accountability, and adequacy of services provided.
4.5. Employing the Force. Employing the force is defined as the conduct and support of air
and space operations from garrison or forward location to include: generating forces to combat
or operational levels; providing timely information and intelligence dissemination; launching,
recovering, or regenerating operational elements; planning for force replacement to continue
operations; preserving installation security; wartime materiel support (WMS). Evaluates the
unit’s capability to employ tasked capabilities IAW procedures and standards described in

     4.5.4.6. See Attachment 7 for Maintenance subareas and commonly inspected tasks.
  4.5.5. Operations.
     4.5.5.1. Evaluate unit’s ability to integrate deployed location procedures and
     requirements into unit’s plans. Evaluate if the unit has a COOP plan which it exercises
     for contingency operations for incidents at the garrison location IAW AFI 10-208,
     Continuity of Operations (COOP) Program. Evaluate if all unit individuals know what
     actions to take during potential incidents. Inspected units normally receive mission
     tasking in-accordance with procedures outlined in JP 3-05.1, JSOTF Tactics, Techniques,
     and Procedures. Typically, more than one graded event is tasked per aircraft
     sortie/special tactics mission (e.g., air refueling, airdrop, airland). Graded events are
     averaged to produce an overall rating for the mission sortie. Operations include assigned
     weapon systems, aircrew flight equipment, airfield operations, and personnel

                          AFSOC SELF INSPECTION PROGRAM

5.1. General Guidelines. Self inspections are conducted by units to assess their compliance
with AF policy. SI provides commanders with a tool for internal assessment of unit health and
complements external assessments. SI prepares units for and complements other inspections.
The SI program outlined in this chapter is a basic framework for units to use in constructing their
program.
   5.1.1. Unit functional and crossfunctional elements should work with their self inspection
   manager to develop guidelines, procedures, criteria, checklists, and resolution requirements
   as required.
   5.1.2. The AFSOC and AFSOC-gained units in Table 5.1. will have a self inspection
   program and are responsible for their sub units. Smaller units may integrate with their parent
   wing/host unit SI program.

Table 5.1. Units That Will Have a Self Inspection Program.

 AFSOTC
5.2. Execution.
   5.2.1. The HQ AFSOC/IG superintendent is the AFSOC self inspection monitor and will
   interface with unit self inspection managers.
   5.2.2. Units identified in Table 5.1. will appoint/designate a SI manager and/or SI team to
   manage the unit SI program. Wings/units with IGs are encouraged to appoint/designate their
   SI manager/team from within their IG and augmentation (similar to the EET construct).
   Units may consider using their EET and the EET process to conduct their SI.
   5.2.3. The unit self inspection manager conducts the self inspection at least annually. Report
   estimated date of completion by 1 July each year to the HQ AFSOC/IGI Analysis Team. Do
   not send self inspection results to the HQ AFSOC/IG. After self inspection has been
   accomplished, send an email reporting completion from the 2-digit level (IG, XP, DO, etc.)
   to AFSOC.IG.ANALYSIS@hurlburt.af.mil.
   5.2.4. Although encouraged, the SI does not have to be accomplished at one time (some
   functionals may accomplish their portions independently).
   5.2.5. Units are encouraged to have a cross tell relationship with the HQ AFSOC/IG,
   AFSOC FAMs and with similar units to develop and execute their SI program. Units may
   consider having functional experts from other units assist with their self inspection.
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                    57


  5.2.6. When able, unit self inspection mangers should organize execution of their SI program
  along functional lines. Functional managers should inspect all elements in the wing/unit that
  are obligated to comply with Air Force instruction(s) that govern their subject matter (linear
  and/or crossfunctional). For example, the wing Communications and Information Systems
  Officer (CSO) should inspect all wing organizations for compliance with AFI 33-112,
  Information Technology Hardware Asset Management.
  5.2.7. Anytime the intent of an AFI is unclear the unit should seek clarification from the
  installation program owner (ex: the Communications Squadron for information technology
  asset management questions) or from the appropriate AFSOC OPR.
  5.2.8. AF CI MGAs/sub-areas and other major inspections. Identify which Air Force CI
  MGAs and sub-areas apply to the unit as well as other major inspections that apply to the
  unit (i.e. ASEV, ATSEP, LCAP, HSI, JCAHO, EESOHCAMP, etc).
  5.2.9. Units should use/tailor all available published inspection checklists for formal
  inspections (CI, HSI, LCAP, IAAP, etc.) to include MAJCOM and/or NGB supplements as a
  basis for organizing and conducting self inspections. Unit supplemental checklists may be
  developed, as appropriate. Checklists do not limit the requirement to comply with any
  published DOD or AF policies, directives, or instructions.
     5.2.9.1. Units will use AFSOC CI checklists and HAF CI inspection checklists (once
     established) to conduct self inspections. AFSOC CI checklists are posted as checklists to
     AFSOCI 90-205, AFSOC Inspection Checklist Program (on the AFSOC Command
     Publications webpage) until superseded by HAF CI checklists that will be posted on the
     AF Checklist site when available (https://wwwmil.afrc.af.mil/afia/). HQ AFSOC OPR
     is HQ AFSOC/IGI.
     5.2.9.2. Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Visit (ASEV) checklists are posted on
     the AFSOC Command Publications webpage as checklists to AFSOCI 90-205, AFSOC
     Inspection Checklist Program. HQ AFSOC OPR is HQ AFSOC/A3V.

Inspection Deficiency Write-ups may contain:
   5.3.1. Deficiency Number. A unique tracking number.
   5.3.2. Short Title. A one line summary/description of the deficiency.
   5.3.3. Detail. Describe, in sufficient detail, the deficiency and contextual facts as necessary
   to clearly convey the defect requiring resolution. The written description alone should be
   adequate for the inspected party to begin corrective action planning.
   5.3.4. Severity. A deficiency severity of Critical, Significant, or Minor.
   5.3.5. Reference(s) to the applicable instruction, technical order, policy letter, or other
   source documentation.

   5.3.9. Corrective Action OPR. Basic responsibility for problem solving and the corrective
   action process resides at the lowest appropriate command level. The unit Corrective Action
   OPR office symbol (typically a squadron commander or equivalent) that is responsible for
   determination and oversight of the corrective action, determining the deficiency code(s)
   (Table 2.1.), and recommending closure when corrective action is complete. In instances
   where corrective action responsibility belongs to both the host and tenant unit (or supported
   and supporting unit), a Corrective Action OPR and a Corrective Action OCR may both be
   assigned to correct the identified deficiency. A Corrective Action OCR also may be
   identified if a deficiency is cross functional and requires action by more than one
   organization within a unit.
      5.3.9.1. Unit corrective action OPRs are encouraged to coordinate their corrective
      actions with the appropriate wing OPR and/or HQ AFSOC OPR. Problem solving should
      be applied through the AF eight-step problem solving model as outlined in the AFSO21
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                     59


       Playbook (or SAF/SO approved publication) to assist in identifying root causes and
       solutions to deficiencies.
   5.3.10. Closing Authority. The deficiency closing authority may be the wing/unit self
   inspection monitor for minor deficiencies or the wing/unit commander (or designee) for
   major and critical deficiencies. The closing authority and the corrective action OPR should
   not be the same individual for deficiency. The closing authority is responsible for reviewing
   deficiency corrective actions for appropriateness prior to closure.
5.4. Deficiency corrective action procedures.
   5.4.1. The unit self inspection monitor will track all deficiencies.
   5.4.2. Corrective action plans may be developed to resolve/close deficiencies.

                                             Chapter 6

                         READINESS OBSERVATION VISITS (ROV)

6.1. Purpose. The Readiness Observation Visit (ROV) provides the AFSOC/CC and staff with
readiness feedback for any AFSOC or AFSOC-gained unit. ROVs also provide direct feedback
to commanders for items solely within their purview, regarding IG perceptions of readiness,
quality implementation, compliance, etc. ROVs can be requested by a unit commander or can be
directed at any time by the AFSOC/CC.
   6.1.1. The IG team may observe unit performance using criteria defined in Chapter 4,
   however, no overall grade will be assessed. ROVs may also be used for new units as an
   introduction to AFSOC and to identify any problems developed as a result of the transition.
       6.1.1.1. An ROV will be tailored in size and purpose as needed. Normally it will be
       limited to a tailored version of one of the four major graded areas of an ORI. The ROV
       will be documented in a manner consistent with the breadth and depth of the visit.
       6.1.1.2. The following areas may be observed during a ROV:
          6.1.1.2.1. Positioning the Force.
          6.1.1.2.2. Employing the Force.
          6.1.1.2.3. Sustaining the Force.
          6.1.1.2.4. Ability to Survive and Operate (ATSO) activities.
       6.1.1.3. IG members may fly on missions when the situation allows.
       6.1.1.4. If an ROV is conducted in conjunction with an actual contingency, the IG will
       observe on a non-interference basis.
6.2. Policy. This chapter applies to all active duty AFSOC units and AFSOC-gained ANG and
AFRC units. HQ AFSOC/IG will coordinate with HQ AFRC/IG and NGB-IG for ROVs of
AFSOC gained AFRC and ANG units.
   6.2.1. Primary areas of focus during ROVs are unit leadership, functional or directorate area
   management, mission accomplishment, and risk management. Scheduled ROVs are
   published in the HQ AFSOC/IG inspection calendar.
   6.2.2. Special Interest Items (SII). Applicable SIIs will be inspected during ROVs.
   6.2.3. Visit Outbrief. The IG will conduct an outbrief with the commander and essential unit
   personnel upon completion of the visit.
   6.2.4. Frequency. ROVs may be conducted any time deemed appropriate by the AFSOC/CC
   or requested by unit CC. ROVs may be requested by a unit commander at any time, but the
   generally expected window would be between 18 months and 6 months prior to an ORI.
6.3. Responsibilities:
   6.3.1. HQ AFSOC Directorate Responsibilities:
       6.3.1.1. Provide qualified augmentees for the IG team.
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                      61


     6.3.1.2. Assist units in correcting issues/findings identified during ROVs. Inform the
     unit when corrective actions are taken.
  6.3.2. HQ AFSOC/IG Responsibilities:

     6.3.2.2. Maintain a record of issues forwarded to the HQ AFSOC staff and the final
     resolution of the issues.
     6.3.2.3. Inform units of directed visits in the inspection schedule. However, the nature of
     an ROV in conjunction with a contingency dictates that the observed unit may have
     extremely limited notification.
     6.3.2.4. Inform directorates of scheduled ROVs and request/task augmentation as
     required.
     6.3.2.5. Coordinate with the observed unit for mission support.
     6.3.2.6. Coordinate with the NGB and/or AFRC Inspector General as required.

                                            Chapter 7

                   OPERATIONAL READINESS ASSESSMENT (ORA)

7.1. Policy.
   7.1.1. This chapter describes the ORA. The ORA may grant full or partial ORI credit to
   AFSOC or AFSOC-gained Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command
   (AFRC) units deployed to a Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) or theater-directed contingency
   operation.
   7.1.2. A unit receiving ORI credit through the ORA process will be scheduled for a full ORI
   within approximately three years (four years for AFSOC-gained ANG units) from the date of
   the ORA initial assessment report.
   7.1.3. The ORA or portions of it may be conducted during the contingency operation or after
   the unit redeploys to home station.
7.2. Administration:
   7.2.1. The OPR for the ORA is the HQ AFSOC/IG. Assessments will be based on ORI
   criteria in this instruction and modified by HQ AFSOC/IG and HQ AFSOC directorates to
   reflect the unit and contingency.
   7.2.2. The AFSOC/CC and HQ AFSOC/IG will determine if a unit is eligible for an ORA
   using the following guidelines:
       7.2.2.1. The unit deploys in support of a JCS or theater-directed contingency operation
       within 6 months of, or within their inspection window.
       7.2.2.2. The unit deploys a significant portion of its assigned forces.
       7.2.2.3. The unit received a standard ORI within the last three years. A unit should not
       receive back-to-back ORA credit.
   7.2.3. Definitions:
       7.2.3.1. Full Credit. A unit receiving full credit has met the establish criteria of that
       major graded area or subarea and will not be inspected in that area or subarea during any
       follow-up training or inspection.
       7.2.3.2. Partial Credit. A unit receiving partial credit has met some of the requirements
       of that major graded area or subarea but not enough to receive full credit. The unit must
       conduct specified follow-up training or be inspected during a tailored ORI to receive full
       credit.
       7.2.3.3. No Credit. A unit receiving no credit has not met any of the requirements of that
       major graded area or subarea. They will conduct follow-up training or be inspected in
       that area to receive credit.
   7.2.4. Follow-Up Training. Training used to validate a unit’s skills or capabilities. This will
   include items required by the AFSOC directorates and will be approved and monitored by
   HQ AFSOC/IG.
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                         63


   7.2.5. Tailored ORI. An ORI designed by HQ AFSOC/IG to inspect specific areas not given
   ORA credit.
7.3. Implementation:
   7.3.1. Initiating the ORA. HQ AFSOC/IG will inform HQ AFSOC and the unit being
   assessed via message that an ORA will be conducted. The message will identify the
   operation being assessed, the dates of the assessment, an HQ AFSOC/IG Point of Contact
   (POC), and direct the unit to save any data or material related to the operation.
   7.3.2. Scheduling ORA activities. The HQ AFSOC/IG POC will coordinate with the unit to
   gather requested data and schedule interviews with requested unit personnel.
      7.3.2.1. The assessed unit will make requested data available at the IG work center the
      morning of the first day of the assessment. A safe for storing classified material will be
      required in the work center.
      7.3.2.2. The HQ AFSOC/IG POC will work with the unit to build a schedule allowing
      approximately one to two hours per interview period.
   7.3.3. Customer Support. HQ AFSOC/IG will conduct interviews with organizations
   working with the assessed unit (i.e. higher headquarters, SOF components, etc.). The results
   of these interviews will be included in the Employment section under a subarea titled
   Customer Support.
   7.3.4. Assessment Outbrief. The IG will conduct an outbrief with the commander and
   essential unit personnel upon completion of the assessment.
7.4. Grading:
   7.4.1. The IG will write a memorandum after an ORA specifying the type of ORI credit the
   assessed unit received. Any findings noted will be documented in the memorandum and will
   be handled IAW AFSOCI 90-201, AF Special Operations Command Inspection Program.
   For ANG units, forward final memorandum to NGB-IGD at ngbidg@ng.army.mil for NGB
   tracking purposes.
      7.4.1.1. The ORA memorandum will contain an overall assessment, ORI credit received,
      required follow up training or tailored inspections, and the timeframe for the next
      inspection.
      7.4.1.2. If a major graded area receives partial credit, each subarea in that area will
      receive a grade of full, partial, or no credit to further define the specific area that did not
      meet requirements.
      7.4.1.3. If required, an addendum to the original memorandum will be published after the
      assessed unit completes required follow-up training.
   7.4.2. A unit given Full Credit for all ORI major graded areas will be credited with having
   completed an ORI and will normally be given a new projected ORI date of approximately 3
   years (4 years for AFRC/ANG) from the date of the ORA memorandum. In the case of a
   unit earning Full Credit for all ORI major graded areas, the period between actual ORIs will
   not exceed 6 years (8 years for AFRC/ANG).
 64                                                              AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


   7.4.3. A unit given Partial Credit in any major graded area or subarea will either conduct
   follow-up training or be inspected in those areas not given full credit. HQ AFSOC/IG will
   determine if the unit will conduct follow-up training or receive a tailored ORI.
       7.4.3.1. Follow-up training. HQ AFSOC/IG will be the HQ AFSOC POC for follow-up
       training. The appropriate HQ AFSOC directorate will serve as OPR. The assessed unit
       will schedule and conduct training in designated areas. HQ AFSOC/IG will monitor and
       validate the unit’s performance during the training. The training will include items and
       events required by HQ AFSOC/IG to ensure unit readiness.                   The follow-up
       training/inspection will be completed within 6 months of the initial assessment.
          7.4.3.1.1. If the unit’s performance is unsatisfactory during the follow-up training,
          the unit will receive a tailored ORI on those areas deemed unsatisfactory, using
          criteria in AFSOCI 90-201, no later than 12 months after the ORA.
       7.4.3.2. Tailored ORI. HQ AFSOC/IG will design and coordinate an area-specific ORI.
       The inspection will be conducted IAW AFSOCI 90-201.
       7.4.3.3. Upon successful completion of follow-up training or a tailored ORI, units will be
       given a projected ORI date approximately 3 years (4 years for AFRC/ANG) from the date
       of the ORA memorandum. The next ORI date may be set up to 3 years from completion
       of the tailored ORI if the HQ AFSOC/IG determines that the tailored ORI was of
       significant enough scope to validate readiness of the majority of the unit’s combat
       capabilities.
   7.4.4. A unit given No Credit overall will receive an ORI; normally 3 years from the last
   accomplished ORI.

                                            Chapter 8

                              QUIET RESPONSE INSPECTION

8.1. Policy.
   8.1.1. The HQ AFSOC/IG conducts QUIET RESPONSE inspections with the primary focus
   on the Installation Emergency Management (EM) Program. Incident command and response
   capabilites will be emphasized rather than strict accomplishment of quick reaction checklists.
   QUIET RESPONSE inspections may be no notice (no notice is N/A for ARC and N/A for
   ANG).
   8.1.2. Functional area inspectors are encouraged to to create their own inspection guides to
   aid in the conduct of the inspection. Inspected units should not use these functional area-
   generated guidesfor inspection preparation, but should train to EM standards outlined in AFI
   10-2501 and AFMAN 10-2502.
8.2. Exercise Concept.
   8.2.1. HQ AFSOC/IG will conduct QUIET RESPONSE inspections of AFSOC units IAW
AFI 90-201. The inspection will be focused on the wing’s ability to to provide an integrated
response to a full spectrum of physical threats. These threats include but are not limited to major
accidents, natural disasters, enemy attacks, and terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction
(WMD). Commanders must be prepared to confront the threats and provide for the protection of
personnel and installation resources while ensuring mission continuation. The following areas
may be inspected during QUIET RESPONSE: emergency and crisis action plans (to include
Incident Action Plans); command, control, and communications; Disaster Response Force (DRF)
elements (Installation Control Center, Crisis Action Team, Emergency Operations Center, Unit
Control Centers, First Responders, and Emergency Responders); response actions; and support
and recovery teams.
8.3. Exercise Conduct.
   8.3.1. QUIET RESPONSE inspections may be no-notice (no notice is N/A for ARC). HQ
   AFSOC/IG will direct execution of a QUIET RESPONSE inspection. The IG will normally
   only evaluate those areas required to mitigate the emergency.
   8.3.2. QUIET RESPONSE communications: HQ AFSOC/IG-driven inspections are initiated
   by verbal or written exercise inputs. The initiation input will start with ‖this is a HQ
   AFSOC/IG QUIET RESPONSE Inspection.‖ After initial notification, all communications
   will be preceded by the phrase ‖ Exercise Message‖ and/or ‖Exercise, Exercise, Exercise.‖
       8.3.2.1. QUIET RESPONSE scenarios: QUIET RESPONSE inspections will be
       structured to test the unit’s integrated responses to a full spectrum of threats. Scenarios
       will be developed around an EM event and have a duration of approximately 4 to 8 hours.
       8.3.2.2. HQ AFSOC/IG inspectors will not confront unit members with scenarios that
       could be interpreted as an actual hostile action. Under no circumstances will any HQ
       AFSOC/IG team member attempt to compromise security for the purpose of conducting
       an inspection.
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                    67


     8.3.2.3. Inspections will not compromise the safety of unit members.                Actual
     emergencies will take immediate precedence over the inspection activities.
  8.3.3. The HQ AFSOC/IG team will serve as Higher Headquarters (HHQ) for all inspection-
  associated events. Any reports, messages, or inquiries normally directed to HHQ will be
  presented by the inspected unit to the AFSOC IG Team Chief or designated representative.
  Units should aniticipate a response to such messages in a time frame commensurate with the
  scenario.
  8.3.4. Safety.
     8.3.4.1. Responsibilities. Unit commanders and supervisors at all echelons are
     responsible for ensuring flight, ground and weapons safety directives are followed.
     Aircrews will adhere to all directives, rules of engagemnt, and air traffic control
     clearances. If deviation from the QUIET RESPONSE scenario becomes necessary in the
     interest of safety, inform the IG Team Chief or an appropriate inspector of the condition
     or hazard and the deviation. Unsafe and/or potentially unsafe operations or conditions
     will be immediately stopped. The IG Team Chief or Wing Commander may temporarily
     halt the inspection for uncontrollable factors that may adversely affect safe operations.
     The unit commander is the final authority for launching missions and is responsible for
     the safety of unit aircraft, aircrews, support personnel and equipment.
     8.3.4.2. Safety Violation. HQ AFSOC/IG inspectors will assess safety throughout the
     inspection. Violation of safety standards could impact ratings in those areas in which the
     violation is observed. Impact on ratings depends on the severity of the violation, and the
     impact and potential impact on unit readiness.
     8.3.4.3. Major Safety Violation. A major safety violation is an unsafe act or condition,
     which results in or in the judgment of an inspector, could result in, serious damage to
     equipment or disabling injury to personnel.
     8.3.4.4. Minor Safety Violation. A minor safety violation is an unsafe act or condition
     which results in, or in the judgment of an inspector could result in, damage to an aircraft
     that does not render it unsafe for flight, damage to equipment that does not render it
     unsafe for use, or less than disabling injury to personnel.
  8.3.5. Security. The HQ AFSOC/IG will publish an Entry Access Listing (EAL) of
  inspectors. The EAL will be delivered to the Wing’s Command Post upon commencement
  of the QUIET RESPONSE inspection.

              SPECIAL OPERATIONS LIAISON ELEMENT (SOLE) ORI

A6.1. General. SOLE Inspection criteria is derived from assigned Mission Essential Tasks
(METs), AFSOCI 13-101, Operational Procedures SOLE, AFSOCI 90-202, Operational
Readiness Inspections, and AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Ability to Survive and
Operate (ATSO) inspection criteria is derived from ACCI 90-201, Addendum H, Air and Space
Operations Center Operational Readiness Inspections.
   A6.1.1. This document does not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or
   assessment. ORI objective is to validate readiness and identify deficiencies that preclude
   attainment of required capabilities. Inspection authority resides in AFI 90-201 and SOCOM
   Directive 525-7, SOLE Program Management.
   A6.1.2. The IG will assign an overall grade to the highest level of organization based on
   performance in four readiness major graded areas: Positioning the Force, Employing the
   Force, Ability to Survive and when applicable, Sustaining the Force. The IG will identify
   and report problem areas with root causes outside SOLE control as extract findings or
   observations.
   A6.1.3. ORI Grading. The inspected unit will be evaluated on its ability to successfully
   integrate SOF into AOC operations IAW established tactics, techniques and procedures.
   Extenuating circumstances should be considered before awarding a grade. The IG Team
   Chief may assign a grade that more appropriately reflects observed performance regardless of
   statistical results. In such cases, the IG will provide an explanation in the written report.
      A6.1.3.1. When applicable, the IG will apply the following five-tier grading scale to rate
      overall unit performance:
          A6.1.3.1.1. OUTSTANDING. Employment ―Outstanding‖, Mission Support and
          Initial Response at least ―Excellent‖ and ATSO at least ―Satisfactory.‖
          A6.1.3.1.2. EXCELLENT. Employment plus one graded area ―Excellent‖ with
          remaining at least ―Satisfactory.‖
          A6.1.3.1.3. SATISFACTORY.           Employment plus two graded areas at least
          ―Satisfactory‖ with remaining at least ―Marginal.‖
          A6.1.3.1.4. MARGINAL. Employment plus two graded areas at least ―Marginal.‖
          A6.1.3.1.5. UNSATISFACTORY. Does not meet criteria. Note: Overall grade
          should be no higher than the Employment grade.
      A6.1.3.2. Readiness major graded areas sub-areas will receive a rating in accordance
      with the performance scale described below:
          A6.1.3.2.1. Mission Ready (MR): Organization is properly trained, organized, and
          equipped to conduct assigned missions. No deficiencies noted.
          A6.1.3.2.2. Mission Ready with Deficiencies (MRD): Organization is properly
          trained, organized, and equipped to conduct assigned missions. Minor deficiencies or
          process improvements noted.
 98                                                            AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


          A6.1.3.2.3. Not Mission Ready (NMR): Unit has significant shortfalls that will
          negatively impact ability to conduct assigned missions.
A6.2. Inspection Overview. SOLE inspections normally take place in conjunction with AOC
ORIs. The AOC is organized to centrally plan, direct, control and coordinate JFACC assigned
assets in support of Joint Force Commander (JFC) objectives. While the SOLE is integral to
AOC operations, it is owned by the JFSOCC and is not subject to AOC inspection criteria.
   A6.2.1. The IG will schedule, coordinate and conduct inspection planning conferences with
   assistance from other participating units. Inspection planning conferences and associated
   exercise planning activities should clearly outline inspection requirements, concept of
   operations, and responsibilities of participants. Careful consideration must be given to
   ensure full integration of inspection objectives into the exercise construct.
   A6.2.2. Small Sample Size. Situations may exist where components of the SOLE are not
   fully employed by the exercise scenario and/or available to participate in the exercise. Under
   these conditions the IG Team Chief may declare an area "Not Rated" due to limited sample
   size/level-of-effort. This determination is normally made prior to the inspection.
   A6.2.3. Limiting Factors (LIMFACs). When approved LIMFACs affect an area rating, the
   IG Team Chief will take extenuating circumstances under advisement. The IG Team Chief
   will fully explain the impact of unclassified LIMFACs on combat capability in the written
   report.
A6.3. Inspection Concept. SOLE ORIs evaluate interoperability between the SOLE and the
AOC, JSOTF, and JSOAC in accordance with governing instructions and concepts established
by theater Operation Plans. The SOLE is responsible for managing/utilizing augmentation in the
most efficient manner. The IG will report training deficiencies or degraded augmentee
performance as extract deficiencies to the appropriate organization.
   A6.3.1. When possible, conduct the ORI as part of a joint computer-assisted exercise in
   order to model realistic Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information
   (C4I) environments. When possible, base the exercise scenario on planning factors and
   concepts of operations outlined in theater Operation Plans.
   A6.3.2. HQ AFSOC/IG will work closely with the host MAJCOM IG to ensure the ORI
   vehicle supports efforts to validate SOLE readiness. HQ AFSOC/IG will normally integrate
   into host IG inspection processes. The IG Team Chief will align/deconflict AFSOC
   inspection processes with the host IG battle rhythm.
   A6.3.3. Inspection Team Composition. Inspection team composition is based upon exercise
   requirements and projected SOLE manning and level-of-effort. A fully manned SOLE
   conducting 24/7 operations will drive the following inspection team requirement:
       A6.3.3.1. Team Chief. Responsible for managing inspection process; AFSOC and host
       MAJCOM/IG interface; AFSOC Inspection Report; inspecting Command and Control
       (C2) processes.
       A6.3.3.2. Inspection Support Manager. Responsible for team support and inspection
       report development and publication.
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                   99


     A6.3.3.3. C2 Subject Matter Expert (SME). Responsible for evaluating overarching C2
     processes and serves as primary interface between the exercise control group and the IG
     Team.
     A6.3.3.4. SOLE SME (Day). Responsible for evaluating Strategy/Plans and Combat
     Operations. Works with C2 SME to ensure continuity of inspection.
     A6.3.3.5. SOLE SME (Night). Responsible for evaluating Strategy/Plans and Combat
     Operations. Works with C2 SME to ensure continuity of inspection.
     A6.3.3.6. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) SME. Responsible for
     evaluating ISR Plans and Operations. Works with C2 SME to ensure continuity of
     inspection.
     A6.3.3.7. Logistics SME. Responsible for evaluating SOLE logistics support to theater
     SOF.
     A6.3.3.8. Communications SME. Responsible for evaluating SOLE Communications
     support to ongoing mission requirements.
     A6.3.3.9. Information Management SME. Responsible for evaluating SOLE IM support
     to ongoing mission requirements.
  A6.3.4. Exercise Control Group (ECG): The ECG is the formal organization tasked with
  oversight and management of the exercise during execution. Exercise control is a process
  that guides and directs the exercise toward achievement of desired training objectives. HQ
  AFSOC/IG participates in this process to secure inspection objectives. Exercise control
  ensures the training/inspection audience receives a coherent, seamless presentation of
  scenario activities through the management of simulation models and Master Scenario
  Events List (MSEL) execution.
     A6.3.4.1. The overall purpose of exercise control is to:
         A6.3.4.1.1. Ensure that simulation and scripted scenario events remain technically
         and operationally synchronized.
         A6.3.4.1.2. Track the accomplishment of critical scenario events and training
         objectives.
         A6.3.4.1.3. Steer the scenario by means of control intervention in the models or
         scripted events.
     A6.3.4.2. Effective exercise control may require exercise controller intervention to
     facilitate required outcomes or to refocus training/inspection audience objectives. The IG
     normally has representation on/or will establish liaison with the ECG to ensure ORI
     objectives are integrated and considered during execution. The IG must engage the
     planning process during concept development for this relationship to be effective.
  A6.3.5. MSEL.
     A6.3.5.1. The MSEL is used by the ECG to drive execution of pre-planned exercise
     objectives and to sequence exercise events. The IG participates in exercise planning to
     ensure the MSEL complements/supports the inspection construct. In cases where the
     exercise does not engage required inspection activities the IG may develop internal, self-
100                                                             AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


      contained scenarios to ensure adequate coverage of all inspected areas. Close
      coordination between the IG and the ECG is critical to ensure deconfliction of
      events/minimize the risk of disrupting the exercise or inspection.
      A6.3.5.2. Exercises governed by the Joint Exercise Program use the CJCS MSEL Tool
      for building and executing the MSEL. IG planners must be familiar with this tool to
      effectively integrate ORI requirements into the host exercise. The IG can influence or
      add MSEL events during execution provided they do not adversely impact the exercise.
      For example, the IG can introduce a PR or an emergency exfiltration scenario to drive
      desired inspection activities.
  A6.3.6. Part Task Evaluation (PTE). PTEs are self-contained events that do not interfere
  with the exercise. Use PTEs to generate SOLE activity not driven by the exercise
  scenario/MSEL. For example, the IG can request SOLE personnel describe the process for
  coordinating time sensitive targets to demonstrate procedures.
  A6.3.7. Report Writing. HQ AFSOC/IG will normally provide inputs to the host MAJCOM
  IG for inclusion into the AOC ORI report. Inputs focus on interoperability and AOC support
  to the SOLE. HQ AFSOC/IG will also publish a separate report for the SOF chain of
  command.
  A6.3.8. Delays. If conditions force a delay/interruption of ORI events, the IG Team Chief in
  coordination with the host MAJCOM IG may suspend the inspection until conditions warrant
  continuation.
  A6.3.9. Safety. The SOLE Director is responsible for ensuring safety directives are
  followed. If safety issues drive deviations in the exercise scenario the IG Team Chief will
  ensure AFSOC inspectors are aware of changes/impacts.
  A6.3.10. Security. IG will provide an Entry Authority List (EAL) as prescribed in AFI 31-
  101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, to the host MAJCOM IG for publication
  and distribution. Authenticate the EAL in accordance with AFI 31101.
  A6.3.11. IG personnel will not present situations that could be interpreted as hostile action.
  A6.3.12. ORI Termination. The IG Team Chief will terminate the ORI by written
  correspondence, or a pre-determined time/event. Following ORI termination, inspected units
  can anticipate an additional two days of validation/report writing prior to the ORI out-brief.
  A6.3.13. Photography. Coordinate all requirements for photography through the host
  MAJCOM IG. Under no circumstances should photographs be taken without proper
  authority.
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                  101

                        ORI COMMONLY INSPECTED TASKS

A7.1. Positioning the Force.
   A7.1.1. Command and Control (C2).
      A7.1.1.1. CAT/Battlestaff.
          A7.1.1.1.1. Readiness Action Management. Evaluate CAT management of readiness
          posture changes IAW AFSOC or theater directives. Determine the impact of
          incomplete actions. Evaluate subordinate UCCs on their ability to complete local
          actions and comply with directives.
          A7.1.1.1.2. Direction and Coordination. Evaluate the mission impact of CAT
          direction and coordination. Evaluate CAT ability to identify problems, reach
          effective solutions, and provide positive direction to execute those decisions.
          A7.1.1.1.3. Command Post (CP). In some cases, AFSOC units do not manage the
          CP and rely on host unit support for this function. In AFSOC, the commander’s
          representative (COMREP) is the focal point for C2 issues in the CP. For units that do
          not manage the CP, the unit COMREP will provide a copy of the host/tenant C2
          Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to the C2 inspector. When AFSOC units do not
          manage the CP, evaluate actions using the support agreement and other directives and
          regulations governing CP operation. In all cases, evaluate the CP with respect to its
          support of and its impact on the unit's mission.
          A7.1.1.1.4. Direction and Coordination. Evaluate CP effectiveness and ability to
          coordinate and manage applicable processes.
          A7.1.1.1.5. Emergency Action Procedures. The IG will not evaluate non-AFSOC
          managed CP emergency actions except for the timeliness and support given to the
          unit CAT. The IG will evaluate AFSOC emergency action messages by considering
          the currency of emergency action checklists, emergency action checklist discipline
          and execution, and the timeliness of unit notification of emergency action messages.
          A7.1.1.1.6. Readiness Action Procedures (RAP). Evaluate readiness posture changes
          with respect to required actions and procedures outlined in Major Command
          (MAJCOM) or theater directives. Evaluate procedures utilized to monitor RAP
          status, completion, and attainment reporting. Determine the mission impact of
          incomplete actions and timeliness.
          A7.1.1.1.7. Operational Reports. Evaluate the timeliness and accuracy of operational
          reporting.
      A7.1.1.2. Subordinate Level Coordination (Applies to functional control centers below
      the CAT level, excluding the CP, as well as key personnel at squadron level and below).
      Evaluate implementation or execution of instructions issued by higher authority.
      Evaluate timeliness and quality of feedback.
      A7.1.1.3. Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS). Each AFSOC unit with an
      AFSOC/CC approved Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement is responsible
102                                                              AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


      for implementation of combat readiness reporting IAW Joint Pub 1-03.3, AFI 10-201,
      Status of Resources and Training System, AFSOC Supplement 1 to AFI 10-201, host-
      tenant agreements, and local procedures. Evaluate SORTS reported capabilities for
      accuracy and timely submission to the host CP. Ensure identified Limiting Factor
      (LIMFAC) are reported in SORTS remarks and reflected in the overall unit rating.
  A7.1.2. Preparing for Operations.
      A7.1.2.1. Takeoff Time. The first takeoff of each generated aircraft validates or
      invalidates generation of that aircraft and all unit preparatory actions required during the
      initial response phase. This applies to both generation and mobility forces. Units may
      continue to perform maintenance on aircraft selected for generation to include all launch
      procedures leading to takeoff. The timeline between X-hour and takeoff for each aircraft
      will be used to validate aircraft generation effectiveness.
      A7.1.2.2. Closure and Inplace Reliability. Each aircraft is reliable if it:
         A7.1.2.2.1. Is properly configured and loaded for the tasked mission prior to takeoff.
         A7.1.2.2.2. Completes all mission tasks. Aircraft aborting or diverting are reliable
         for maintenance considerations if they meet the other conditions of this paragraph.
         A7.1.2.2.3. Accomplishes a reliable air refueling, if scheduled.
         A7.1.2.2.4. Unless otherwise directed, arrives at its designated destination no later
         than closure or inplace time. In the absence of a closure or in-place time, aircraft
         arriving in excess of 2 hours after scheduled time are unreliable.
      A7.1.2.3. Operations. Evaluate operational unit deployment activities and preparations
      for employment. Consider unit-level mobility preparation and processing; flight and
      mission planning; preparation for employment flying, mission and operational activities.
      A7.1.2.4. Information Operations.
         A7.1.2.4.1. Evaluate the effectiveness of all areas of IO integration and planning.
         Evaluate Wing or Group-level Intel’s ability to provide pre-deployment situation
         awareness and threat status, to include potential adversary IO threats, and target status
         to IO planners.
         A7.1.2.4.2. Influence Operations (IFO).       Evaluate, where appropriate, the
         effectiveness and integration of Operations Security (OPSEC), Military Deception
         (MILDEC) Psychological Operations (PSYOP), CounterIntelligence, and Public
         Affairs (PA).
             A7.1.2.4.2.1. MILDEC. Determine if primary and alternate MILDEC Officer
             and NCO have been appointed for all program levels within the inspected unit
             (i.e. Wing, group, and/or squadron level as appropriate). Determine whether unit
             deployment requirements are consistent with the unit’s ability to execute
             MILDEC taskings. Determine if the unit has developed and maintained generic
             MILDEC execution checklists for the five techniques as identified in AFI 10-704.
             Determine if all checklist have been pre-coordinated and integrated with other IO
             functions. Determine if MILDEC participants are adequately educated and
             trained in MILDEC TTPs.
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                 103


           A7.1.2.4.2.2. OPSEC. Determine if primary and alternate Program Managers
           (PMs)/coordinators have been appointed for all program levels within the
           inspected unit (i.e. Wing, group, and/or squadron level as appropriate). Ensure
           personnel understand and follow OPSEC policies, guidelines and
           countermeasures as appropriate. Determine if the unit has an OPSEC Plan pre-
           coordinated and integrated with other IO functions and ready to implement.
           Determine whether unit deployment requirements are consistent with the unit’s
           ability to plan and execute OPSEC taskings.                Determine if OPSEC
           PMs/coordinators are adequately represented in all applicable working groups
           (i.e. Threat, Force Protection, Anti-Terrorism, etc.). Evaluate the application and
           effectiveness of the units efforts to protect critical information with respect to
           OPSEC, Information Assurance (IA), communications security COMSEC,
           computer security (COMPUSEC) and Information Protection (IP) procedures
           through the use of applicable security programs, units and methods to include the
           AF’s Electronic Systems Security Assessment (ESSA) program, 57th Information
           Aggressor Squadron and red teaming tactics, techniques and procedures.
           A7.1.2.4.2.3. PA operations.
              A7.1.2.4.2.3.1. Ensure PA staff responds rapidly to appropriate recalls and
              locations (CAT, battlestaff, DCG) and mans the PA office as required. The
              senior PA should be near the commander to provide trusted council. Ensure
              Public Affairs Officer (PAO) develops appropriate work/rest cycle for PA
              staff.
              A7.1.2.4.2.3.2. The PAO and staff should be ready and trained to deploy with
              adequate equipment, reference material and supplies to provide effective PA
              support to the unit commander, theater, Joint Task Force (JTF) and Operation
              Plan (OPLAN) taskings. Typical PA deployment equipment includes digital
              camera, laptop, deployment bags, and issued weapon.
              A7.1.2.4.2.3.3. The PA staff should disseminate host nation sensitivities,
              cultural information, basic deployment tips and media training to deploying
              members through briefings or other command/internal information tools.
              A7.1.2.4.2.3.4. Ensure PA contacts the MAJCOM or theater command PA for
              most current guidance in a timely manner.
              A7.1.2.4.2.3.5. Ensure PA staff assists in protecting critical information and
              applies the principles of OPSEC prior to, during, and after any deployment or
              employment of forces into the area of operations.
              A7.1.2.4.2.3.6. Determine if PA Officers are adequately represented in all
              applicable working groups.
              A7.1.2.4.2.3.7. Ensure PA develops and maintains an appropriate internal
              information program and provides trusted council to leaders to enhance
              morale and readiness.
              A7.1.2.4.2.3.8. Ensure commander uses PA to get necessary information to
              deploying troops.
104                                                        AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


             A7.1.2.4.2.3.9. Ensure PA attends the commander's or battlestaff meeting to
             impart and gather pertinent information.

      shown in Table 2.3 On Time Takeoff standards for Departure Timing Grade
         A7.1.3.5.1. On-Time Takeoff departures will be determined using the following
         criteria:
             A7.1.3.5.1.1. Simulated Airlift: For simulated airlift, the following items must be
             available for the inspector's review at cargo load start time IAW the unit's DSOE:
                 A7.1.3.5.1.1.1. All cargo/equipment sequenced IAW the aircraft load plan
                 (load plan must have actual weights, except for baggage/PAX totals), load
                 team (to include required Material Handling Equipment (MHE), and all
                 required documentation (e.g., DD Forms 1387-2, Special Handling
                 Data/Certification (if used), DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record,
                 cargo waivers, etc.). A planned PAX count will be used to compute the
                 aircraft center of balance station.
                 A7.1.3.5.1.1.2. All PAX and actual baggage weights must be available at
                 PAX load start time with final copies of the PAX manifest and the aircraft
                 load plan.
             A7.1.3.5.1.2. Actual Airlift/Organic: For actual airlift movements or organic
             movements, the following items must be available for aircraft
             commander’s/inspector’s review prior to loading the aircraft:
                 A7.1.3.5.1.2.1. All cargo/equipment identified from the aircraft load plan
                 (load plan must have actual weights, except for baggage/PAX totals).
                 A7.1.3.5.1.2.2. All required documentation (e.g., DD Forms 1387-2, DD
                 Form 2133, etc.). A planned PAX count will be used to compute the aircraft
                 center of balance. Documentation errors identified during this review should
                 not preclude cargo from being accepted for loading, unless these errors
                 jeopardize load safety or alter aircraft cargo load sequencing. Documentation
                 errors must be corrected prior to aircraft departure. Adjustments to aircraft
                 load plans after load start will not adversely affect the rating for departure
                 timing, provided the inspector determines that the changes would not affect
                 aircraft departure time for a simulated load, or changes do not impact actual
                 departure times of real world support airlift or organic movements.
                 A7.1.3.5.1.2.3. Actual Mission Departures: Timing is dictated by unit DOC
                 statements or applicable OPLAN instructions.

         A7.2.4.3.3. Evaluate the accurate identification and proper processing of material
         management requests.
         A7.2.4.3.4. Evaluate established work schedules for their effectiveness in achieving
         maximum capability with assigned personnel.
         A7.2.4.3.5. Evaluate the effectiveness of efforts to cross-utilize skills in handling
         surges and priority requirements.
         A7.2.4.3.6. Evaluate the adequacy of supervision and assignment of personnel tasks
         commensurate with skill level and training.
         A7.2.4.3.7. Evaluate the serviceability, accountability, availability, and, in the case of
         Precision Measurement Equipment (PME), proper calibration of support equipment,
         to include deployed powered Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE), non-powered
         AGE, PME, tool kits, and special tools (e.g., engine change kits), as well as the
         support equipment furnished by the host at the deployed operating location.
         A7.2.4.3.8. Evaluate the accurate control and documentation of cannibalization
         actions.
      A7.2.4.4. Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR)/Battle Damage Assessment (BDA).
      ORI tasked units with organic ABDR capability are evaluated on the effectiveness of the
      ABDR program. As a minimum, the IG will review the following areas: readiness of
      ABDR kits to deploy and availability of the ABDR trained technicians and assessors.
         A7.2.4.4.1. Effective Use of ABDR on Damaged Aircraft. Evaluate serviceability of
         deployed ABDR kits, and effectiveness of personnel to properly assess and repair
         damaged aircraft using ABDR techniques. Assessment should include all facets,
         which aid in determining aircraft status, estimated repair times, and mission
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                     119


        degradation. ABDR repairs will only be accomplished on designated ABDR training
        aircraft or hulks.
        A7.2.4.4.2. Units Without Organic ABDR Capability. Those units without organic
        ABDR programs will at a minimum perform initial BDA. Assessment will include
        the ability to effectively save a suspected or actual battle damaged aircraft for
        potentially unexploded ordinance as well as provide initial information required to
        request Combat Logistic Support Squadron (CLSS) repair team support IAW T.O.
        0025107. Note: Ratings for management deficiencies will be determined by the
        mission impact of the specific deficiency in each category. For example, minor
        deviations in radio discipline may have little or no impact on the mission. However,
        poor radio discipline or OPSEC/COMSEC procedures that adversely impact the unit's
        ability to generate and launch aircraft may have a major effect on the mission.
     A7.2.4.5. Munitions Storage and Handling:
        A7.2.4.5.1. Evaluate unit ability to properly store and handle munitions in a dynamic
        environment. Evaluate unit ability to properly secure and safeguard stored assets.
        A7.2.4.5.2. Munitions handling.      Evaluate unit munitions control functions,
        munitions accountability, munitions inspections, personnel training, and delivery
        procedures to ensure compliance with applicable directives.
        A7.2.4.5.3. Munitions control. Evaluate security of munitions assets. Evaluate
        control of key, lock and access inventories. Evaluate emergency action procedures.
        A7.2.4.5.4. Munitions accountability. Evaluate asset balance, condition and code
        shelf/service life of on hand assets. Evaluate issue, receipt, and document
        transactions of inventories.
  A7.2.5. Operations. Mission sorties are graded in four areas: Command and control (unit
  level), Mission Planning, Mission Employment and Mission Results.
     A7.2.5.1. Mission Planning. Evaluate proper analysis/application of capabilities,
     mission requirements, and threats. Units should plan for realistic and appropriate route
     lengths, but in no case will the route be shorter than 5 minutes prior to the first in-flight
     warning. Do not plan excessive delays for timing purposes. Examples of excessive
     delays include unrealistic alternate timing legs, holding for time control purposes (unless
     approved by the IG), and slower than normal airspeeds.
        A7.2.5.1.1. Units will fly low level navigation routes at altitudes specified in their
        applicable Air Force or AFSOC Instructions, minimum published low level route
        altitudes, or altitudes commensurate with the scenario threat, whichever is highest.
        A7.2.5.1.2. Weather minimums are IAW applicable Air Force Instructions.
        Minimums and conditions may be simulated for ORI purposes. These will be briefed
        by the IG prior to the event or be specified in the exercise ground rules.
        A7.2.5.1.3. Units will provide the IG inspector copies of the complete aircrew folder,
        including flight orders, computer flight plans, charts with route of flight, threats, and
        target descriptions, prior to the mission back-brief/briefing for each employment
        event.
120                                                           AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


         A7.2.5.1.4. Airdrop events will utilize actual loads and personnel whenever possible.
         If drop zone (DZ) or other conditions preclude their use, the IG Team Chief may
         approve the use of standard airdrop training bundles (SATB).
      A7.2.5.2. Mission Employment.
         A7.2.5.2.1. Low Level. Aircrew will fly (if applicable) a preplanned low level
         profile IAW their associated 11-series instructions. In-flight, aircrew may modify the
         preplanned flight path when required for time control, weather, Air Traffic Control,
         or simulated threats and associated threat maneuvers.
         A7.2.5.2.2. Formation. Evaluate IAW AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 3, T.O. 11C120,
         Flight Crew Air Refueling Procedures, and 1-1C-1-29, Flight Crew Air Refueling
         Procedures with KC-135 and KC-10.
         A7.2.5.2.3. Electronic Warfare/Self-Defense Capability (EW/SDC). Use guidelines
         in CJCSM 3212.02 and AFTTP 3-1, Volumes 2, 31, 32, 33, and 34.
         A7.2.5.2.4. Units equipped with electronic warfare systems must identify mission
         essential (ME) systems and ensure they are installed and operational. If the ME
         system is not operational, then the aircrew must explain how they will negate threats.
         A7.2.5.2.5. Actual or simulated airborne or ground threats will be used to develop
         the mission scenario and plan. The IG may observe crew response and planning
         against such scenario-driven threats or initiated threats to evaluate self-defense
         capability. The rating in the area is a function of observed tactical awareness and the
         employment of appropriate countermeasures.
         A7.2.5.2.6. Mission Results.
            A7.2.5.2.6.1. Airdrop. Airdrops will be evaluated. The majority of instrument
            meteorological condition (IMC) or simulated-IMC (electronic) drops will be to
            unmarked DZs.
            A7.2.5.2.6.2. DZ Size. IAW AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone
            Operations, minimum DZ size will be mutually agreed upon by the Air Force and
            the using unit commander having control of the operation/exercise. DZ size will
            vary and should be based on mission requirements, aircraft/aircrew capabilities,
            and items to be airdropped.
            A7.2.5.2.6.3. Scoring. For successful airdrop event credit, the equipment or lead
            jumper of a stick must land within a 300 meter radius of the agreed upon point of
            impact or within the surveyed boundaries of the drop zone, whichever is less;
            90% of personnel and equipment must land on the surveyed drop zone for credit
            as a successful airdrop. IG personnel will attempt to determine the cause of each
            unsuccessful drop. If an unsuccessful drop is the result of an aircrew error (crew
            coordination, incorrect release point or coordinates, etc.) or is caused by other
            functions of the evaluated unit (incorrect load rigging, C2, etc.), the event will be
            scored as unreliable. If an unsuccessful drop is caused by an equipment or load
            malfunction, or for a reason that cannot be determined, the event will not be
            scored.
            A7.2.5.2.6.4. Time over target (TOT). Score TOT as successful if within plus or
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                   121


           minus 30 seconds. A TOT of 31 seconds or more is considered unsuccessful.
           A7.2.5.2.6.5. Leaflet Drops PSYOP (MC-130). Normally, one leaflet drop is
           tasked for each leaflet capable unit operating MC-130 aircraft. Evaluate either
           actual or simulated leaflet drops, and specifically evaluate aircraft preparation and
           crew duties (at altitude) for leaflet dissemination. Consider the employment
           successful if aircrew performance results in a leaflet drop meeting mission
           requirements.
           A7.2.5.2.6.6. Infiltration and Exfiltration (infil/exfil). Success is determined
           based on accomplishment of the mission objective according to mission tasking
           and the following criteria:
           A7.2.5.2.6.7. The approach, hover/landing, infil/exfil, and departure are graded
           as one event. If a Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP) event is conducted, it
           will be graded separately from the infil/exfil.
           A7.2.5.2.6.8. Time of Arrival (TOA). Score TOA as successful if within plus or
           minus 30 seconds. A TOA of 31 seconds or more is unsuccessful.
           A7.2.5.2.6.9. For fixed wing aircraft, record TOA based on the time during the
           initial approach that the aircraft passes abeam/over the touchdown zone in a
           position to safely land.
           A7.2.5.2.6.10. For rotary wing aircraft, record TOA based on the time the aircraft
           is in a position to land.
           A7.2.5.2.6.11. Overt Airland Events (fixed wing). Runway criteria are IAW AFI
           11-2MC/HC-130 specific, Vol. 3. Consider an event successful if:
              A7.2.5.2.6.11.1. For Airfield Marking Pattern 1 (AMP 1) or Airfield Marking
              Pattern 2 (AMP 2) marked landing zones, touchdown is in the AMP 1 or AMP
              2 touchdown zone and the aircraft slows to taxi speed within the available
              runway.
           A7.2.5.2.6.12. Covert Airland Events (fixed wing). Runway criteria are IAW
           AFI 11-2MC/HC-130, Vol. 3. Consider an event successful if:
              A7.2.5.2.6.12.1. For Night Vision Goggle (NVG) landings to either marked
              or unmarked runways, the aircraft is able to safely turn off at the appropriate
              taxiway, or stop abeam the planned onload/offload point.
           A7.2.5.2.6.13. Airland or Hover (rotary wing). Conduct landing/hovers on
           properly surveyed landing zones (LZ) IAW applicable AFIs. Hover at the
           minimum safe altitude to accomplish the mission. Crews may initiate go around
           prior to or after touchdown. Score any touchdown prior to the touchdown zone as
           unreliable. Do not score goarounds due to factors beyond the control of the
           aircrew (personnel or equipment on the landing zone, etc.)
           A7.2.5.2.6.14. FARP. (Units qualified in FARP operations). The IG will task
           a tanker for a minimum of two receivers using covert lighting and radio silence.
           The primary success criteria for hot refueling operations are a safe and successful
           fuel transfer. Immediately discontinue fuel transfer for any leaks or other
122                                                      AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


      potentially dangerous situations. Procedures outlined in AFI 11-235, Forward
      Area Refueling Point (FARP) Operations, AFI 23-201, Fuels Management, T.O.
      00-25-172, Ground Servicing Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding, AFI 11-
      2MDS specific, Volume 3, and aircraft technical orders will be followed when
      conducting hot refueling/FARP operations. A FARP operation (tanker) may be
      considered successful if no fuel transfer occurs due to reasons beyond the control
      of the tanker aircrew (e.g., receiver aircraft fail to show). In this case, the tanker
      aircrew must meet the remaining criteria listed below to consider the event
      successful. If a leaking hose can be safely and efficiently removed/repaired/shut-
      off, refueling operations may continue. An additional 10 minutes is allowed to
      replace/repair a leaking hose or piece of equipment. For grading, consider a
      FARP operation reliable if the tanker:
         A7.2.5.2.6.14.1. Briefs and is aware of emergency procedures, escape routes,
         and crew rendezvous areas.
         A7.2.5.2.6.14.2. Taxis to the briefed location and follows marshaller signals
         (if available) to properly position for the refueling operation (if one is
         established).
         A7.2.5.2.6.14.3. Properly deploys the required equipment (properly checked
         and tested) in the appropriate pattern for the number of receivers.
         A7.2.5.2.6.14.4. Conducts refueling under NVG conditions and is ready to
         accept a receiver within 20 minutes from setting the aircraft brakes.
         A7.2.5.2.6.14.5. Safely transfers the pre-briefed/required fuel to the receivers
         using proper procedures.
         A7.2.5.2.6.14.6. Properly removes residual fuel from hoses and equipment
         and stows equipment aboard the tanker aircraft within 30 minutes from
         disconnect from the last receiver.
      A7.2.5.2.6.15. FARP (helicopter). In addition to the criteria specified in
      paragraph A7.2.5.2.6.14., evaluate helicopter FARP operations using the
      following guidance:
         A7.2.5.2.6.15.1. Receivers arrive at the FARP location plus or minus two
         minutes from scheduled arrival time.
         A7.2.5.2.6.15.2. Receivers taxi to proper refueling location following
         marshaller signals (if available).
         A7.2.5.2.6.15.3. During FARP operations, personnel display proper
         procedures for manning refueling nozzles and hoses, bonding and transfer of
         fuel.
         A7.2.5.2.6.15.4. Fire Protection plan: Provide the Senior IG Fire Inspector a
         copy of the site specific Fire Prevention/Fire Protection plan and any
         applicable ORM's.
      A7.2.5.2.6.16. Air to Air Refueling (AAR), Helicopter Air to Air Refueling
      (HAAR), and Tilt-Rotor Air to Air Refueling (TAAR).
AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011                                                                 123


              A7.2.5.2.6.16.1. Fixed wing receiver. Task appropriate units to demonstrate
              air to air refueling capability. The primary inspection criteria are a safe and
              successful transfer of fuel. For a single aircraft or the lead aircraft in a
              formation to be successful, that aircraft must:
                A7.2.5.2.6.16.1.1. Accomplish a successful rendezvous.
                A7.2.5.2.6.16.1.2. Transfer the pre-planned fuel load, updated fuel
                requirement, or limit the transfer to not exceed maximum gross weight.
                A7.2.5.2.6.16.1.3. The pre-briefed or required fuel load is transferred to all
                aircraft prior to the end point.
                A7.2.5.2.6.16.1.4. Score TOA at the rendezvous initial point (RVIP) or
                rendezvous control point (RVCP) as appropriate for the type rendezvous.
                TOAs may change in-flight. Use the coordinated new TOA agreed to by the
                tanker, receiver, and C2 plus or minus one minute, as appropriate.
              A7.2.5.2.6.16.2. Fixed wing tanker/helicopter or tilt-rotor receiver. Evaluate
              IAW AFI 11-2MDS specific, Volume 3, aircraft flight manuals, and ATP-
              56(B). Evaluate air refueling capability as an employment event. The
              primary requirement is a safe and successful fuel transfer to support helicopter
              requirements.
                A7.2.5.2.6.16.2.1. SOF TOA scoring will be based on event aircraft
                arriving at or abeam the ARCP at the air refueling control time (ARCT).
                Tanker TOA will be on time to one minute late. Receiver TOA will be one
                minute early to on time. TOA may change in-flight. Use the coordinated
                TOA agreed to by tanker, receiver, and C2 plus or minus one minute, as
                appropriate. CSAR tanker TOA will be on time to two minutes late.
                Receiver TOA will be two minutes early to on time.
                A7.2.5.2.6.16.2.2. External factors beyond the control of the tanker or
                receiver will not impact the event rating.            For example, receiver
                malfunctions or other associated events beyond the control of the tanker will
                not impact on the event rating of the tanker. Similarly, tanker malfunctions
                will not reflect on the event rating of the receiver.
           A7.2.5.2.6.17. Weapons Employment, Live/Dry Fire. Weapons employment
           should support the framework of the exercise scenario. Each sortie evaluated
           must properly identify the target and select weapons and munitions appropriate
           for target destruction.
              A7.2.5.2.6.17.1. Record TOT based on the time the aircraft first enters the
              area, range, or other specified point approved by the IG.
              A7.2.5.2.6.17.2. The primary consideration for weapons employment is target
              destruction and timely mission accomplishment. This is a subjective
              evaluation based on effectiveness of fire.
           A7.2.5.2.6.18. AC-130 Call for Fire. No TOT should be used. AC-130 call for
           fire is an offensive maneuver with primary considerations being adherence to the
           call-for-fire briefing, team identification, target identification, and target
124                                                           AFSOCI90-201 15 JUNE 2011


             engagement.
             A7.2.5.2.6.19. Psychological Operations EC-130 Weapons Systems. This
             paragraph outlines specific ORI employment criteria for special operations EC-
             130 units. Rate subareas IAW basic regulation except where specified otherwise.
                A7.2.5.2.6.19.1. Mission Planning. Evaluate effective use of the mission
                planning cycle.
                A7.2.5.2.6.19.2. Mission Flight Profile. Aircrews must demonstrate adequate
                navigation to meet on-station requirements. Evaluate aircrew effectiveness
                against the assigned tactical electronic combat mission.
                A7.2.5.2.6.19.3. PSYOP Effectiveness. Evaluate on-station time based upon
                the time actually supporting the tasked mission versus the scheduled
                transmission time. On-station time includes the period while crews may be
                characterizing and analyzing the signal environment or conducting Electronic
                Countermeasures (ECM). Evaluate safe and effective transmitter usage and
                operation. Transmissions may be radiated on an approved or assigned
                frequency, or transmitted into "dummy load" if no frequency is available. If
                the aircraft is not in its assigned orbit, but is in a position from which the
                aircrew can effectively perform its electronic combat mission, count this time
                as effective on-station time. The flight profile may involve an orbit, track, or
                penetration route.
      A7.2.5.3. Special Tactics.
         A7.2.5.3.1. Evaluate performance in the joint/combined arena in support of a task
         force commander’s scheme of maneuver. The ORI will evaluate areas from the unit
         Mission Essential Task (MET) listing, which is based on the DOC statement, and
         OPLAN force listings. Sub-tasks associated with each MET area will be evaluated
         IAW conditions and standards. The 720 Special Tactics Group (STG) will publish
         METs and Tasks, Conditions, and Standards (TCS).
             A7.2.5.3.1.1. In addition to the criteria in this section, evaluate combat weather
             units utilizing the criteria in Sections A7.2.5.7.
             A7.2.5.3.1.2. Units should be rated on their ability to execute realistic mission
             scenarios consistent with the most probable contingencies for their theater of
             operations. Unit commanders are responsible to ensure planners integrate as
             many MET related events as possible into the exercise scenario. Note: There is
             no minimum number of events required during an inspection; however, an
             inspection that does not include multiple events covering a wide array of a unit’s
             capabilities may be extended or continued at IG discretion.
