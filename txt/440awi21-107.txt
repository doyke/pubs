1. General Information.
   1.1. The 440 AW FOD Prevention Program is based on awareness and training with
   continuous individual and supervisory involvement. Professionalism and discipline are the
   keys to any successful program. The overall program objective is “ZERO FOD”.
   1.2. Remove all foreign object (FO) debris prior to aircraft or system operation and upon
   completion of any maintenance, support or operations task.
   1.3. Ensure aircraft flight decks are free of FOD prior to identifying aircraft as crew ready.
 2                                                        440AWI21-107 16 SEPTEMBER 2010


     1.4. Do not store trash or FOs in a toolbox. A FO bag will be part of each flight line
     dispatchable toolbox. Inspect and clean the FO bag each time the toolbox is checked in or
     out.
     1.5. Attach lanyards of sufficient strength (wire, rope, cable, etc.) to the tool/equipment and
     to the user or fixed secure object when working in an area where falling objects may damage
     the aircraft, support equipment or injure personnel.
     1.6. Attach safety pins, lock pins, small parts, etc., to the parent equipment with a lanyard or
     pin-bag.
     1.7. Perform a thorough inspection to remove rocks and other debris from wheel wells if
     aircraft have operated on unimproved landing zones before the next flight.
     1.8. Ensure the area is free of FO debris and secure or remove loose items (maintenance
     stands, support equipment, tool boxes, etc.) from the aircraft danger area before engine start.
     1.9. Wear identification tags (dog tags) only when mission requirements dictate.
     1.10. A metal clip may be added for positioning of area badge or passes, provided a cord is
     passed through the eye of the clip for security. Do not wear clips near energized electrical
     circuits. Cords will be of a breakaway design if worn around the neck.
     1.11. Ball cap type hats are not authorized on the flight line. Exception:            3/53 APS
     personnel may wear red ball caps when escorting passengers/jumpers to aircraft.
     1.12. Transient aircraft will have plugs and covers installed (if applicable) unless access is
     required for maintenance.
2. Engine Maintenance.
     2.1. Tools and loose hardware will not be placed on engine nacelles or components. Use
     tool and hardware trays, bags, bins, etc.

     coveralls are in good repair, worn properly and removed upon exiting the intake.
     2.3. Aircraft intakes and exhausts will be inspected using a composite tool kit (CTK) issued
     flight light.
     2.4. Document all structural engine intake maintenance using a RED X symbol in the AFTO
     Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, or engine work package and
     G081.
3. Tool and Equipment Control.
     3.1. The Composite Tool Kit (CTK) program is outlined in 440 AWI 21-143, Composite
     Tool Kit Procedures for AFRC units and 43 OG Maintenance Instruction 21-1, Aircraft and
     Equipment Maintenance Management for AMC units.
     3.2. During "red ball" maintenance, account for all tools/items prior to leaving the aircraft.
     3.3. Tool kits will be immediately inventoried upon completion of each maintenance task or
     prior to operational checks (engine start, landing gear operation, etc.)
4. Hardware Control.

   4.1. Issue bench stock items on a one-for-one basis to the maximum extent possible;
   scrounging is not authorized. Return all excess items to the bench stock location.
   4.2. Use cloth bag(s) with draw strings or any container that can be sealed, securely attached
   to the component and labeled with aircraft/equipment serial number to store hardware and
   small parts. Components removed and stored on approved storage racks/shelves during
   Isochronal or "home station check" inspections meet the intent of this requirement.
   4.3. Document loose and missing fasteners found in or forward of the engine intake on the
   AFTO Form 781A with a RED X. For missing fasteners, inspect the engine for FOD IAW
   paragraph 15 of this instruction.

      6.2.2. Initial responders, responding to an actual emergency (fire trucks, police cars, etc.)
      are not required to stop and remove FO. When the emergency is terminated, canvas the
      area and route for FO debris.
      6.2.3. Use a locally manufactured tool to facilitate the removal of FO from vehicle tires.
      Etch tool with the vehicle identification number and attach to key ring.
