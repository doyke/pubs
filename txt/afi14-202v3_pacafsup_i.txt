their staffs, combat crews, weapon system developers and other customers are provided the
best available information and materials to enhance readiness, facilitate planning , execute
assigned Missions and build warfighting capability. Intelligence supports strategic,
operational, and tactical operations by providing information and services to a divergent set of
customers, ranging from national to unit-level decision makers.
1.2. Office of Primary Responsibility. AF/A2 delegates office of primary responsibility
(OPR) for this instruction to AF/A2F.
1.2. (PACAF) Office of Primary Responsibility. PACAF/A2 delegates Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) for this Supplement to PACAF/A2O.
1.3. Senior Intelligence Officer Authority. The Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO) is
responsible for and is the final authority for intelligence functions and operations within an
organization.

                                           Chapter 3

                                MAJCOM INTELLIGENCE

3.1. MAJCOM Intelligence. MAJCOM Intelligence exercises day-to-day responsibility for
intelligence support to the MAJCOM commander and plans and programs for intelligence
required at the operational level to meet theater commander’s objectives. The MAJCOM SIO
(referred to as the MAJCOM/A2) is responsible for all intelligence operations at the MAJCOM
level. MAJCOM Intelligence is responsible for managing resources and ensuring training and
personnel are available to subordinate intelligence organizations. AFRC Intelligence may
delegate its MAJCOM responsibilities to AFRC NAF Intelligence as appropriate. Due to the
varied nature and size of MAJCOMs, intelligence responsibilities too large for organizations

Aircrew— The total complement of crewmembers (primary crewmember, Mission crewmember)
required to operate an aircraft and to complete an assigned Mission.
Air Tasking Order (ATO)— A document containing specific Mission tasking and relevant
data by unit and aircraft.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)— The status of intelligence personnel who have satisfactorily
completed Mission Qualification Training, are qualified in the unit Mission, but do not
maintain MRICMR status. Personnel must be able to attain MRICMR currency status within30
days, or as otherwise specified in the applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)v1.
Basic Qualification (BQ)— The status of intelligence personnel who have satisfactorily
completed iQT and are qualified to perform basic duties, but may not perform Mission duties
unsupervised. BQ is a prerequisite for all personnel to enter MQT. The member must perform at
a minimum level as established in the applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)v1. BQ is not a long term
qualification status.
Changeover Briefing— A briefing to provide incoming personnel a synopsis of events and
issues to prepare them for their shift. include issues needing immediate attention, pending
tasks, personnel and equipment problems, work center status and briefing times
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)— The status of intelligence personnel who have
satisfactorily completed MQT and maintain qualification and currency in the appropriate tasks
and knowledge required by their respective AFI 14-2(MDS)v1. See Mission Ready (MR).

to deny unauthorized persons information of value that might be derived from the
possession and study of telecommunications, or to mislead unauthorized persons in their
interpretation of the results of such possession and study. Communications security includes:
cryptosecurity, transmission security, emission security, and physical security of
communications security materials and information. a. cryptosecurity--The component
of communications security that results from the provision of technically sound cryptosystems
and their proper use. b. transmission security--The component of communications security that
results from all measures designed to protect transmissions from interception and
exploitation by means other than cryptanalysis. c. emission security--The component of
communications security that results from all measures taken to deny unauthorized persons
information of value that might be derived from intercept and analysis of compromising
emanations from crypto-equipment and telecommunications systems. d. physical security-
-The component of communications security that results from all physical measures necessary
to safeguard classified equipment, material, and documents from access thereto or observation
thereof by unauthorized persons.
Computer Security (COMPUSEC)— The protection resulting from all measures to deny
unauthorized access and exploitation of friendly computer systems.
Concept of Operations (CONOPS)— A verbal or graphic statement, in broad outline, of a
commander’s assumptions or intent in regard to an operation or series of operations. The
concept of operations frequently is embodied in campaign plans and operation plans; in the
latter case, particularly when the plans cover a series of connected operations to be carried
out simultaneously or in succession. The concept is designed to give an overall picture of
AFI14-202V3_PACAFSUP_I 18 NOVEMBER 2009                                                     33


the operation. it is included primarily for additional clarity of purpose. Also called
commander’s concept.
CONPLAN— An operation plan in an abbreviated format that would require considerable
expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the
combatant commander’s strategic concept and those annexes and appendixes deemed necessary
by the combatant commander to complete planning. Generally, detailed support requirements are
not calculated and time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) files are not prepared. A
CONPLAN with TPFDD is the same as a CONPLAN except that it requires more detailed
planning for phased deployment of forces.
Continuation Training (CT)— CT provides the volume, frequency and mix of training
necessary for intelligence         personnel to maintain proficiency in their assigned
qualification level. The Ready Intelligence Program (RIP) outlines the minimum CT
requirements. RIP is designed to focus training on capabilities needed to accomplish a unit’s
core tasked Missions. Continuation Training (CT) is separate from skill level upgrade training,
although CT may fulfill some skill level upgrade training requirements. CT and RIP are
discussed further in Chapter 4 of the MDS-specific AFI 14-2(MDS)v1.
Currency— A measure of how frequently and/or recently a task is completed. Currency
requirements should ensure intelligence personnel maintain a minimum level of proficiency in a
given event.
Debriefing— The process to convert Mission information into intelligence for dissemination to
affected parties. The intelligence specialist will extract relevant Mission intelligence from
pilots/aircrew, ask amplifying questions relevant to the Mission, identify time-sensitive
information and disseminate appropriately and expediently.
Deployment Briefing— A briefing to provide intelligence information to pilots/aircrew, key
staff, and deploying personnel prior to deployment. intelligence information is tailored to
the unit’s specific Mission, roles and combat profiles in accordance with the unit
OPLAN/OPORD tasking.
Electronic Intelligence (ELINT)— Technical and geolocation intelligence derived from
foreign non-communications electromagnetic radiations emanating from other than
nuclear detonations or radioactive sources.
Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFIs)— Key questions to be asked by
adversary officials and intelligence systems about specific friendly intentions, capabilities,
and activities, so they can obtain answers critical to their operational effectiveness.
Essential Elements of Information (EEIs)— Critical items of information about the enemy
and the battlespace required by the commander and planners to successfully prosecute an
operation. Have aircrews review established EEIs and prepare them to observe and report
any significant information during debrief.
Formal Course— Training courses listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course
Announcement (ETCA).
Geospatial Information and Services (GI&S)— The concept for collection, information
extraction, storage, dissemination, and exploitation of geodetic, geomagnetic, imagery

littoral, cultural, and toponymic data accurately referenced to a precise location on the earth’s
surface. These data are used for military planning, training, and operations including
navigation, Mission planning, Mission rehearsal, modeling, simulation and precise targeting.
Geospatial information provides the basic framework for battlespace visualization. it is
information produced by multiple sources to common interoperable data standards. it may be
presented in the form of printed maps, charts, and publications; in digital simulation and modeling
databases; in photographic form; or in the form of digitized maps and charts or attributed
centerline data. Geospatial services include tools that enable users to access and manipulate
data, and also includes instruction, training, laboratory support, and guidance for the use of
geospatial data.
Human Resources Intelligence (HUMINT)— A category of intelligence derived from
information collected and provided by human sources.
Imagery Intelligence (IMINT)— intelligence derived from the exploitation of collection
by visual photography, infrared sensors, lasers, electro-optics, and radar sensors such as
synthetic aperture radar wherein images of objects are reproduced optically or electronically on
film, electronic display devices, or other media.
Initial Situation Briefing— A briefing to provide the commander and key staff with
intelligence pertaining to the current crisis, and the events that have led to it. The briefing will
usually be presented following recall or alert notification.
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)— Training needed to qualify intelligence personnel for
basic duties in an assigned position for a specific MDS, weapons system, intelligence function
or activity, without regard for a unit’s specific Mission.
Intelligence— information relating to the capabilities, intentions and activities of foreign
powers, organizations or persons, but not including CI (except for information on international
terrorist activities). intelligence collects and analyzes information in order to forewarn
decision makers, commanders and operators (aircrews, security forces, etc.) before an act
occurs.
Intelligence Formal Training Unit (FTU)— Formal intelligence training to support a specific
Mission design series weapons system or specific intelligence function. intelligence
personnel will complete intelligence FTUs, where available, as part of initial Qualification
Training.
Intelligence Read File (IRF)— A collection of publications and material determined by the
MAJCOM and unit as necessary for day-to-day intelligence operations.
Intelligence Requirement— A requirement for intelligence to fill a gap in the command’s
knowledge and understanding of the battlespace or threat forces. intelligence requirements are
designed to reduce the uncertainties associated with successful completion of a specific friendly
course of action (COA); a change in the COA usually leads to a change in intelligence
requirements. intelligence requirements that support decisions which affect the overall Mission
accomplishment are designated by the commander as priority intelligence requirements (PIR).
Less important intelligence requirements are designated as IR.
Master Question File (MQF)— Question bank used to construct closed book exams.
AFI14-202V3_PACAFSUP_I 18 NOVEMBER 2009                                                            35


Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT)— Scientific and technical intelligence
obtained by quantitative and qualitative analysis of data (metric, angle, spatial, wavelength,
time dependence, modulation, plasma, and hydromagnetic) derived from specific technical
sensors for the purpose of identifying any distinctive features associated with the target. The
detected feature may either be reflected or emitted.
Mission Briefing— A briefing to provide the pilots/aircrew with the latest intelligence
affecting the Mission. Accurate and timely intelligence information should be provided on
targets, Mission areas, en-route threats, evasion and recovery, and any other factors essential to
Mission success.
Mission Planning Cell (MPC) Initial/Feasibility Briefing— A briefing to provide the MPC
with a review of the tactical Mission(s) to include overall battle situation, threats, & target
considerations.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)— Training needed to qualify intelligence personnel to
perform their specific unit Mission in an assigned position. AFI 14-2(MDS)v1 prescribes
minimum MQT requirements.
Mission Ready (MR)— The status of intelligence personnel who have satisfactorily completed
MQT and maintain qualification and currency in the appropriate tasks and knowledge required
by their respective AFI 14-2(MDS)v1. See Combat Mission Ready (CMR).
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)— Any headquarters, agency, or activity having the
primary functional interest in, and responsibility for, a specific action, project, plan, program, or
problem.
Operational Control (OPCON)— Command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational
control is inherent in combatant command (command authority) and may be delegated within
the command. When forces are transferred between combatant commands, the command
relationship the gaining commander will exercise (and the losing commander will relinquish)
over these forces must be specified by the Secretary of Defense. Operational control is the
authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving
organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and
giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the Mission. Operational control
includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training
necessary to accomplish Missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be
exercised through the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is
exercised through subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional
component commanders. Operational control normally provides full authority to organize
commands and forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational control
considers necessary to accomplish assigned Missions; it does not, in and of itself, include
authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization,
or unit training.
Operations Order (OPORD)— A directive issued by a commander to subordinate
commanders for the purpose of effecting the coordinated execution of an operation.
Operations Plan (OPLAN)— Any plan, except for the Single integrated Operational Plan,
for the conduct of military operations. Plans are prepared by combatant commanders in response
36                                       AFI14-202V3_PACAFSUP_I 18 NOVEMBER 2009


to requirements established by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and by commanders of
subordinate commands in response to requirements tasked by the establishing unified
commander. Operation plans are prepared in either a complete format (OPLAN) or as a concept
plan (CONPLAN). The CONPLAN can be published with or without a time-phased force and
deployment data (TPFDD) file. An operation plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be
used as a basis for development of an operation order (OPORD). An OPLAN identifies the
forces and supplies required to execute the combatant commander’s strategic concept and a
movement schedule of these resources to the theater of operations. The forces and supplies are
identified in TPFDD files. OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked operation. The
plan is prepared with the appropriate annexes, appendixes, and TPFDD files as described in the
Joint Operation Planning and Execution System manuals containing planning policies,
procedures, and formats.
Operations Security (OPSEC)— A process of identifying critical information and
subsequently analyzing friendly actions attendant to military operations and other activities to:
a. identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems; b. determine
indicators that hostile intelligence systems might obtain that could be interpreted or pieced
together to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries; and c. select and
execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of friendly
actions to adversary exploitation.
Order of Rattle (OR)— The identification, strength, command structure and disposition of
personnel, units and equipment of any military force.
Production Requirement (PR)— An established intelligence need considered in the
allocation of intelligence resources to fulfill the essential elements of information and other
intelligence needs of a commander.
Proficiency— The quality of having competence and a command of the fundamentals
derived from practice and familiarity. A measure of how well a task is completed. An
individual is considered proficient when helshe can perform tasks at the minimum acceptable
levels of speed, accuracy, and safety.
Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO)— The SIO is the highest-ranking Air Force officer holding
the 14N3 or 14N4 Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) and serving in an Air Force intelligence
position. The SIO’s authority extends to all directly subordinate units. installations with
intelligence activities in different chains of command will have separate SIOs. in this
capacity, the SIO provides senior guidance on all policy development, interpretations, and
applications. Further, the SIO serves as the chief advisor and mentor for AF intelligence
officers, enlisted and civilians (as appropriate) in terms of career development and progress.
Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)— 1. A category of intelligence comprising either
individually or in combination all communications intelligence, electronic intelligence, and
foreign instrumentation signals intelligence, however transmitted. 2. Intelligence derived from
communications, electronic, and foreign instrumentation signals.
Situation Briefing— A briefing to provide the commander and key staff and pilots/aircrew with
the latest intelligence to assist in decision-making.
Situation Map— A map showing the tactical or the administrative situation at a particular time.
AFI14-202V3_PACAFSUP_I 18 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          37


Specialized Training— Training in any skill necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned Missions
that is not required by every intelligence unit member. Specialized Training is
accomplished after Mission Qualification Training and after the member is assigned
MR/CMR or BMC status, and is in addition to MR/CMR or BMC requirements. For
example, as outlined in AFI 14-2F-16, F-16 Unit intelligence Training, an External
intelligence Trainer (EIT) requires Specialized Training and certification to conduct intelligence
training for pilots. EITs have additional qualification and currency requirements to maintain
proficiency in conducting intelligence training.
Special Tactics Squadron (STS)— A task-organized squadron of special tactics that may
include combat control, pararescue, and combat weather personnel. Functions include austere
airfield and assault zone reconnaissance, surveillance, establishment, and terminal control;
terminal attack control; combat search and rescue; combat casualty care and evacuation
staging; and tactical weather observations and forecasting.
Staff Assistance Visit (SAV)— A visit from higher headquarters intelligence personnel usually
to review subordinate unit processes and procedures to evaluate and improve programs
and overall combat readiness.
Step Briefing— A briefing given to pilots/aircrew immediately prior to departure for tasked
Mission. The step briefing provides the pilots/aircrew with last minute intelligence affecting their
Mission.
Training Command— The MAJCOM assigned responsibility for formal school training in
each MDS/ weapons system-specific intelligence function or activity.
Target Materials— Graphic, textual, tabular, or other presentations of target intelligence
primarily designed to support operations against designated targets by one or more
weapons systems. Target materials are suitable for training, planning, executing, or evaluating
such operations.
Threat Update Codes (TUC)— Codes used to communicate significant new threat
information to aircrew and Mission planners as rapidly as possible. TUCs are tracked by
alphabetical or numerical codes, which will enable units and aircrew to track these significant
changes to ensure they have the most current information before stepping to a Mission. This
also will assist in providing airborne updates through airborne controllers. TUCs are reserved
for new and critical information that may have a direct impact on the Mission. Specific TUC
criteria will be JFACC-developed. For example, at the first Mission briefing of the day the threat
code is zero or A (according to JFACC-developed criteria). in this example, a SAM site is
relocated and the unit receives new coordinates. Because this will impact the unit’s Missions, a
threat update is issued and the letter/number is changed- to 1 or B, for example. if a pilot/aircrew
asks what the TUC is and it is different than the last one the pilot/aircrew had, the
pilot/aircrew knows the threat intelligence needs to be updated with whatever changed since
the last update.
Trend Program— Analysis designed to identify areas requiring attention, monitoring or
correction.
Unit— A level of organization under HHQs (MAJCOM) required to establish an intelligence
function.
