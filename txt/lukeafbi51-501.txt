            (Attachment 2 for active duty and reserve military personnel, Attachment 3 for

            2.1.1.2. Seize subject’s DD Form 1173, Uniformed Services Identification and
            Privilege Card, if subject is a dependent or non-military-affiliated civilian. ID cards

     2.2. Forward all shoplifting case files to 56 FW/JA within seven working days. Case files

   3.4. When an individual applies for a new identification card reinstating AAFES and DeCA
   privileges, check the 56 SFS listing and DEERS database to ensure the suspension period has
   elapsed (usually one year). If suspension period has not elapsed, ensure the individual has
   presented a written waiver from 56 MSG/CC reinstating the privileges.
      3.4.1. If an individual lost their Base Exchange, Commissary, and/or Shoppette
      privileges at another installation, not Luke AFB, reinstate their privileges one year from
      the date privileges were removed in DEERS.
4. 56 MSG/CC Responsibilities.
   4.1. Conduct all hearings on Base Exchange, Commissary, and Shoppette privileges
   suspension, if requested by the subject of the shoplifting incident. Review all the evidence,
   to include witnesses, videos, legal status, and any other pertinent information, to determine if
   the subject is guilty of civil theft from AAFES or DeCA. The legal standard for all hearings
   will be a preponderance of the evidence, which simply means that 56 MSG/CC must find it
   “more likely than not” that the subject committed the shoplifting. If 56 MSG/CC does not
   find the subject guilty—under a preponderance of the evidence standard—then withdraw the
   suspension of privileges. If 56 MSG/CC does find the subject is guilty by a preponderance
   of the evidence, then the subject shall receive one of the following:
      4.1.1. Suspension of subject’s privileges to Base Exchange, Commissary, and Shoppette,
      with automatic reinstatement at the expiration of one year.
      4.1.2. Permanent revocation of privileges to Base Exchange, Commissary, and
      Shoppette, if the subject has committed another on-base shoplifting offense within the
      past five years. 56 MSG/CC may reinstate privileges after 24 months upon the subject’s
      request.
   4.2. Review all AAFES and DeCA shoplifting cases involving subjects who have committed
   another shoplifting offense within the past five years. The subject shall receive permanent
   revocation of privileges with reinstatement possible after 24 months, provided any claim for
   damages is fully paid.
5. 56 FW/JA Responsibilities.
   5.1. Advise 56 MSG/CC on the shoplifting case prior to Base Exchange, Commissary, and
   Shoppette privileges suspension hearing.

SUBJECT: Suspension of Base Exchange, Commissary, and Shoppette Privileges of Active
         Duty and Reserve Military Personnel

1. You have been apprehended for shoplifting at the Base Exchange, Commissary, or Shoppette.
Therefore, your Base Exchange, Commissary, and Shoppette privileges are suspended.

2. You have the right to request an administrative hearing before me. At such hearing, you will
be provided an opportunity to offer evidence on your own behalf. A decision will then be made
whether to terminate this suspension or revoke your privileges. A copy of the evidence against
you may be obtained at the Reports and Analysis Section of the Luke Security Forces Squadron,
Building 179.

3. The administrative hearing is separate from any criminal violations that may be charged from
this incident. You will still be subject to criminal charges. The hearing only determines the
status of your Base Exchange, Commissary, and Shoppette privileges.

4. If you do not request a hearing within 30 days, your privileges will be automatically
suspended for one year, or revoked permanently depending on the circumstances.

5. Suspension is for a temporary length of time: At the end of any suspension period, your
privileges will be automatically reinstated. Revocation is permanent. However, during the
suspension/revocation period, you may request, in writing, to the 56 MSG/CC through
56 SFS/SFAR, that your Base Exchange, Commissary, and Shoppette privileges be reinstated.

6. While under suspension or revocation, you are ordered not to enter any Base Exchange,
Commissary, or Shoppette at any military installation for any purpose EXCEPT the following:

   a. You may use eating establishments in the Base Exchange facility lobby for eating
purposes only;

   b. You may use Base Exchange hair cutting facilities for a haircut only; and

    c. You may enter Base Exchange shopping facilities for the sole purpose of purchasing
military clothing.

In all cases, you must first provide this memorandum to a Base Exchange employee at the
facility you are entering.

7. Violation of this order may result in extension of the period of suspension, permanent
revocation, or other appropriate judicial, non-judicial, or administrative actions.
