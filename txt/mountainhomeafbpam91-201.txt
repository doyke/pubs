         3.3.2. Hexachlorethane (HC) smoke is highly toxic in concentration. Prolonged
         exposure to light concentration will also produce toxic effects. Do not initiate in
         unventilated or enclosed areas. All personnel will have a protective mask immediately
         available before HC smoke is used and should mask if in the vicinity of any
         concentration of smoke.

       4.1.5. (Required for M116A1 only) Kevlar Helmet, Flack Vest/Jacket and eye
       protection (goggles/face shield).
    4.2. General:
       4.2.1. M115A2 GBS contains 2 ounces of photo flash powder and a whistle assembly.
       4.2.2. M116A1 grenade simulators contain 1.25 ounces of photo flash powder.
    4.3. Safety precautions:
       4.3.1. Do not use in enclosed areas.
       4.3.2. Initiate simulators on a surface free of rocks and debris that could become
       projectiles.
       4.3.3. Make every attempt to ensure end caps of simulators are facing 90 degrees away
       from any item that may be damaged, or use a pit or barricade for deployment. End caps
       may become a projectile hazard upon detonation.
       4.3.4. Do not remain in the area of a damaged simulator longer than necessary after it has
       been exposed to excessive moisture. Filler can react with moisture, creating hydrogen
       gas this reaction may generate sufficient heat or pressure to cause the munition to
       detonate.
       4.3.5. Comply with safety distances as identified in paragraphs 2.2 through 2.2.7.
    4.4. Drop criteria: If item is dropped, see specific item TO (Attachment 1) for drop
    criteria. Consult EOD or Munitions personnel for instructions.
    4.5. Pre-use inspection:
       4.5.1. Safety clip missing or not engaged--notify EOD immediately.
       4.5.2. Any damage or defect capable of affecting safe handling of grenade, or which will
       reduce proper functioning--turn in to Ammo.
    4.6. Preparation and use:
       4.6.1. Remove and retain safety clip, grasp plastic cap and gently extend the cord from
       the tube.
       4.6.2. Pull the cord straight back sharply, and throw, observing the safety distances
       referenced in paragraphs 2.2 through 2.2.8. Note: Do not pull at an angle from the tube.
       4.6.3. Walk away quickly keeping 90 degrees from the end caps and your back to the
       simulator.
       4.6.4. M115A2 - After 6-10 seconds, the whistle will sound for 2-4 seconds, followed by
       an explosion and a flash.
       4.6.5. M116A1 - After a 5-10 second delay, there will be an explosion and a flash.
       4.6.6. Police the area of debris.
