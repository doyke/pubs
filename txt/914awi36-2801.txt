SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changes have been made in the criteria that will be evaluated when scoring the nominations.
Award submissions are now permitted for work performed in significant additional duties.
Requirement has been added that when using acronyms they must be explained on a separate
sheet of bond paper and submitted with the AF 1206. This will help those voting on the award
package to better understand the meaning of each bullet. Nominations cannot contain
accomplishments that were performed in strictly a military status. Makes use of headings on the
AF 1206 optional.

1. General. The success or failure of any recognition program depends on the enthusiasm and
personal support provided by commanders and supervisors. The prestige and honor associated
with an individual’s selection are major contributing factors to this success. With high levels of
competition and resultant quality selection, this program can be an effective tool for enhancing
morale.
2. Responsibilities.

     2.3. The office of secondary responsibility for conducting these programs is 914 FSS/FSMC.

        procedures or composition as deemed appropriate by unique circumstances.

        appropriate suspense dates.

        achievement certificates for 914 AW/CC signatures.
        2.3.7. Provide the names of all semi-annual/annual winners to the Public Affairs Office
        so they can arrange for the engraving of awards and can publicize the semi-annual and
        annual award nominees/ceremonies in all applicable medium.
        2.3.8. Convene the Civilian Selection Board and brief members on board procedures.
3. Selection Board.

     annual awards will be held in conjunction with the 2nd half semi-annual awards board.
     3.2. 914 FSS/FSMC will notify group commanders to provide a board member. Group
     commanders will provide 914 FSS/FSMC with the name, organization/office symbol, and
     duty phone of each board member.
