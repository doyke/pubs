and Job Performance in Primary Duties heading, a maximum of three lines under the Training, Education,
and Self Improvement Efforts heading, and a maximum of three lines under the Other Accomplishments
heading. All references to EPRs and or Enlisted Performance Reports have been deleted. In addition, all
boards will be records only. A bar (|) indicates changes since the last edition.

3. Promotion Quota. The number of promotion stripes allocated to each large unit (squadron), and those
for the combined small units who will meet the Central Base Board, will be based on a promotion oppor-
tunity rate of 15 percent. The quota will be calculated by the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) and
approved by the MPF Commander. Once the quota computations are approved, the MPF will notify each
large unit of their quota. The eligibles of all the small units will be consolidated to compete for available
Central Base Board quotas.

4. Small Unit/Central Base Board Procedures. Commanders of units with less than seven eligibles are
considered “small units (squadron)” and will not earn their own quota of promotions to award. The MPF
will provide commanders of small units with a list of all eligible A1Cs. Commanders of small units must
consider all A1Cs identified by the MPF. The MPF will suspense small units to submit all eligible nomi-
nees to the Central Base Board. For each nominee selected to appear before the Central Base Board, the
unit commander will submit five copies of the nomination package consisting of a cover letter (Attach-
ment 2) and an AF Form 1206 (Attachment 3). A maximum of fifteen lines excluding headings in the
AF Form 1206 (front side only) will be allowed with the mandatory nine lines of leadership and job per-
formance in primary duties, three lines of training, education, and significant self-improvement efforts,
and three lines of other accomplishments. Any AF Form 1206 submitted in improper format will be
returned to the unit for corrections, if time permits.
    4.1. Central Base Board Composition. The Central Base Board will consist of five Chief Master Ser-
    geants (CMSgt) and a board recorder (from the Promotions Office). The 6th Air Mobility Wing,
    Command Chief Master Sergeant (6 AMW/CCC), will appoint five CMSgts, one as the board presi-
    dent. Within reason, it is preferable to have one CMSgt from each of the four groups. If needed due
    to nonavailability of required number of CMSgts, 6 AMW/CCC is authorized to substitute a Senior
    Master Sergeant (SMSgt). Once appointed, board members will be committed to serve unless other-
    wise excused by 6 AMW/CCC.
    4.2. Nominee Evaluations. All nominees will be evaluated by a records only BTZ board. The board
    president ensures the fair and equitable consideration of each nominee. Since the objective of the
    BTZ program is to select only truly outstanding personnel for early advancement, the promotion
    board is not obligated to select the full quota. Each nominee’s selection folder, duty performance,
    knowledge, and leadership qualities are evaluated and compared with other nominees.
    4.3. Selection Folder. For the Central Base Board, the MPF will prepare selection folders for each
    nominee and a score sheet for each board member (Attachment 4) and a score sheet for the Board
    President (Attachment 5). Selection folders will contain a BTZ report of individual personnel (RIP),
    citations for decorations, and the AF Form 1206.
MACDILLAFBI36-101 8 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                      3


5. Large Unit (Squadron) Procedures. Commanders of units with seven or more eligibles are consid-
ered “large units” and will have their own quota of promotions to award. Large units will consider all
A1Cs identified by the MPF as being eligible for promotion consideration to SrA BTZ. The MPF will
provide commanders of large units with a list of all eligible A1Cs and a suspense for identifying the
selected Airmen to be promoted. Commanders of large units are the promotion authority and their deci-
sion to promote is final. There is no requirement for the large unit BTZ board to use the entire quota of
stripes.
   5.1. Large Unit (Squadron) Board Composition. Commanders of large units will convene a unit
   selection board. The board will consist of at least two Senior Noncommissioned Officers (SNCO) and
   a CMSgt. If a CMSgt is unavailable, then another SNCO can be appointed instead. The board presi-
   dent will establish a time and place for the board to convene and inform the unit commander of their
   nomination. Board members will evaluate each eligible Airman in the same manner as the Central
   Base Board for small units. Cover letters for nominations will be for “SRA BTZ LARGE UNIT
   BOARD” and signed by the flight or squadron commander of the individual being nominated. Nom-
   inations will be on the AF Form 1206 (Attachment 3). A maximum of fifteen lines excluding head-
   ings in the AF Form 1206 (front side only) will be allowed with the mandatory nine lines of leadership
   and job performance in primary duties, three lines of training, education, and self-improvement
   efforts, and three lines of other accomplishments.
   5.2. Selection Folder. For the large unit selection boards, the commander’s designated representative
   will prepare a selection folder and a ballot for each board member. Selection folders will contain a
   BTZ RIP, citations for decorations, and the AF Form 1206. The MPF will provide BTZ RIPs to large
   units for each of their eligible Airmen.

6. Reporting the Board Results. The board recorder will tabulate the results of the Central Base Board,
prepare a summary for the board president’s signature, and forward the results to the wing commander for
approval. Included with the summary will be the board members’ ballots, a tabulation of the ballots, the
AF Forms 1206, and the BTZ RIPs of the selected Airmen. Also included, for reference only, will be the
names of the large unit selectees listed on a separate sheet. Once the board results have been approved,
the MPF will notify the respective squadron commanders of each selectee. The MPF will update the per-
sonnel records of each selectee.

7. Supplemental BTZ Consideration. Commanders (“large” and “small” units) may request supple-
mental BTZ consideration for individuals who should have been considered by a previous board and the
error is not discovered until after promotions are announced. After obtaining the squadron commander’s
recommendation, the MPF will forward the supplemental request to Headquarters, Air Force Personnel
Center, Directorate of Personnel Program Management, Airman Promotions Branch (HQ AFPC/DPP-
PWM), for consideration.
