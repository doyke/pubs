1.6.1. (Added) At Robins AFB, the 778th Civil Engineer Emergency Management Flight (778

Office of EM.
1.6.2. (Added) Staff Assistance Visits (SAV) for Tier 1 units will be conducted annually. Tier
2 unit SAVs will be conducted every twenty-four months or as requested. Tier 3 units do not
require a SAV.
2.4. (Added) At Robins AFB, the core functions of the Installation Readiness Board (IRB) are
combined within the Mission Partners, Operational Review Forum (MPORF) to reduce
duplication of effort. The MPORF is the senior-level advisory committee responsible for inter-
disciplinary operational readiness and support performance on the installation. The MPORF
meets bi-weekly and is chaired by the Installation Commander (78 ABW/CC). Installation
readiness and EM topics are addressed every twelve weeks.
2.4.1. (Added) Emergency Management Working Group (EMWG). The 78 MSG/CC and 78
CEG/CL co-chair the EMWG and determine installation briefing topics to be included for the
MPORF.
2.4.1.5. (Added) Installation Exercise and Evaluation Working Group (IEEWG).      As a
minimum, the IEEWG briefs the MPORF on installation exercise schedule, trends, exercise
results and exercise related topics from HQ AFMC.

para 3.b and vulnerability assessment (to include terrorist use of CBRNE) IAW AFI 10-245.
3.10.1.1.1. (Added) The Robins EM Program is tailored to best support the local command
structure and mission partnerships. Units have been assigned tier levels to define program
support requirements. The Installation EM Office will manage the program with regard to
installation partnerships and focus manpower and sustainment requirements on units having a
greater response roll, establish process improvement and serve to foster installation partnerships.
3.10.14. (Added)      Unit commanders will prepare unit personnel and mission sustainment
against threats identified within the Robins AFB Installation Emergency Management Plan
(IEMP) 10-2.
3.10.14.1. (Added) Robins AFB is an industrial complex. Due to the industrial design of many
worksites, and population density, some facilities have minimal locations suitable and available
for sheltering against hazardous material (HAZMAT) and tornado threats. Unit Commanders
will support preparedness against identified threats through awareness and education of assigned
personnel.
3.10.14.2. (Added) Unit EM Representatives, with assistance from Facility Managers, will
identify best available space and necessary actions within their worksites for personnel to shelter
in-place. Unit Commanders will ensure occupants are aware of shelter procedures. Consult 778
CES/CEXM if assistance is needed.
3.10.15.1. (Added) Unit Commanders/Directors or Staff Agency Chiefs will use the RAFB
Evacuation and Shelter In-Place Guide for conducting a facility assessment to determine SIP kit
feasibility. If procurement of SIP equipment kits is determined feasible after the facility
assessment, expedient SIP equipment kits will be provided for each safe room identified. Unit
EM Representatives will identify expedient sheltering kit contents to the Commander/Director or
Staff Agency Chief for budget planning as needed.
3.11.1. (Added) Unit Commanders/Directors will appoint a primary and alternate unit EM
Representative to manage/coordinate unit requirements of the Robins AFB EM program. Each
organization on Robins AFB is assigned a tier level to define program support requirements.
Consult the EM Flight for current tier level representation requirements. Units without specific
support tasks, or deployment requirements, may serve only as a conduit to pass EM information
to their unit personnel.
3.11.1.2.1. (Added) Unit EM Representatives for Tier 1 units will submit unit quarterly
reports no later than fifteenth day of the month following each calendar quarter; January, April,
July and October. The quarterly reports must be digitally or ink signed by the unit commander.
Robins Form 100 will be used for this report. Unit EM Representatives will use the unit
quarterly EM report to update current team assignments and training dates for all unit assigned
EM positions (i.e., Unit EM Rep, CAT, EOC/ESF, UCC, EET members, etc.).
3.11.1.2.1.1. (Added) Jan-Mar: Due NLT 15 Apr.
3.11.1.2.1.2. (Added) Apr-Jun: Due NLT 15 Jul.

3.11.11.1. (Added) Unit Control Centers (UCCs) are established to support the Robins Air
Force Base Command Post (CP), CAT and EOC. Refer to Robins AFB Plan 17 for a list of unit
control centers on Robins AFB and procedures.

minimum; current Robins Military Grid Reference System map, unit specific checklists
supporting the Robins AFB IEMP 10-2, operational land-line communications, written guidance
for activation, de-activation, relocation, evacuation, and shelter in-place procedures.
3.11.13. (Added)     Facility Managers will contact 78 CEG Customer Service to survey
applicable Air Handler Systems to determine shut-off procedures.
3.11.21. (Added) Unit EM Representatives for Tier 1 units will use the Robins AFB Unit EM
SAV checklist to conduct and document self-inspections semi-annually and will be completed in
January and July. Unit Commanders/Directors will review and approve EM self- inspections
before submission to the Installation Office of EM. Once completed forward a copy to 778
CES/CEXM for review and coordination.
9.2.2. (Added) AFVA 10-2510, USAF Emergency Notification Signals for the United States
will be posted on bulletin boards in each occupied building. Unit EM Representatives will
ensure that information boards include their name and contact information. Facility specific
shelter locations will be identified by display of a visual graphics provided by 778 CES/CEXM.
