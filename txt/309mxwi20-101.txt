1. General Information. NWRM is a separately defined materiel classification. The
successful application of these procedures requires the full cooperation of all 309 MXW
personnel associated with the delivery, induction, repair, and selling of NWRM items. The
control of NWRM is a joint responsibility between the 309 MXW, supply chain management,

and the Nuclear Storage Facility (NSF). This instruction addresses tasks that 309 MXW
personnel must use to maintain positive inventory control of NWRM items.
     1.1. Any NWRM item undergoing depot maintenance, that is not in the Maintenance
     Information System (MIS), must be reported by the maintenance technician or any
     production support personnel, as soon as the discrepancy is noticed to the immediate
     supervisor, group NWRM responsible officer (RO), and 309 MXW NWRM RO.
     1.2. Systems: NWRM in the MRO process will be managed using multiple MISs and tools.
     Systems used by 309 MXW personnel include, but are not limited to: Exchangeable
     Production System (EPS/G402A), Job Order Production Master System (JOPMS/G004L),
     Maintenance Business System Modernization (MABSM) known as Maintenance Overhaul
     and Repair System (IMPRESA), Inventory Tracking System (ITS/G337), and Automated
     Bill of Material (ABOM)/ Naval Air System Command Industrial Material Management
     System (NIMMS).
     1.3. NWRM Training.
        1.3.1. General Training Requirements: Prior to handling NWRM, the 309 MXW
        Commander/Director and supervisors at all levels must ensure personnel (military,
        civilians, and contractors) assigned NWRM duties must complete the NWRM
        fundamentals course. The 309 MXW training flight provides information concerning
        individual training records.
        1.3.2. At a minimum, individuals must complete the NWRM fundamentals course prior
        to performing NWRM duties, and every 12 months thereafter until no longer performing
        NWRM duties.
        1.3.3. All 309 MXW personnel will have appropriate NWRM courses added to
        individual training plans in their Production Acceptance Certification (PAC) folder.
        1.3.4. Individuals overdue NWRM training will not perform tasks associated with
        NWRM, until the individual‘s training is current and documented in the system.
2. Roles and Responsibilities.
     2.1. 309 MXW Group Commanders/Directors will:
        2.1.1. Exercise custody, care, safekeeping, and security over NWRM in MRO processes
        performed by squadrons/units under their functional control.
        2.1.2. Ensure all personnel performing NWRM related duties complete the NWRM
        fundamental course. If performing RO duties, the NWRM accountable officer (AO)
        course must be completed.
        2.1.3. Designate in writing, a group RO to provide NWRM oversight over all assigned
        NWRM workloads. Update letter annually, or as changes occur, and provide to 309
        MXW NWRM RO.
        2.1.4. Ensure maintenance technicians packaging NWRM as a completion of a
        maintenance action are PAC certified on that task.
        2.1.5. Ensure 309 MXW personnel (schedulers, AF expediters, production support
        technicians [PST], etc.) handling, verifying quantities, receiving, and turning in NWRM
309MXWI20-101 2 NOVEMBER 2011                                                               3

3. Maintenance Holding Area Management.
   3.1. All NWRM items placed in the holding area, will have a MIS generated work control
   document (WCD) with the item.
4. Depot-Level Maintenance Processing.
   4.1. Tracking: Ensure serial number (SN) tracking and accountability is maintained for all
   NWRM through the entire MRO process; from the time NWRM items are accepted from
   NSF, until the same NWRM items are turned into the NSF or to Defense Logistics Agency
   (DLA) Disposition Services, formerly known as Defense Reutilization and Marketing
   Service (DRMS). All NWRM in the 309 MXW undergoing a maintenance or DEMIL
   action, will be documented and accomplished using a WCD.
      4.1.1. All WCDs involving NWRM will be clearly distinguished from other work
      orders/WCDs by electronically annotating, hand scribing, or stamping in red ―NWRM‖ at
      the top of the document.
4                                                      309MXWI20-101 2 NOVEMBER 2011


       4.1.2. Embedded NWRM subject to a maintenance action will be recorded on their own
       ‗child‘ WCD.
       4.1.3. AF NWRM items in possession of the 309 MXW, and used for maintenance bench
       checks, will be accounted for using Special Purpose Recoverable Authorized
       Maintenance/Equipment Accounts IAW AFMAN 23-110.
    4.2. Items No Longer Undergoing MRO Processes: All completed repair actions, including
    harvested items, will be properly identified with the appropriate materiel condition tag. The
    tag will be annotated with the item nomenclature, SN, part number (PN), and national stock
    number (NSN) of the item being returned to the NSF.
       4.2.1. A turn-in transaction will be processed in the applicable MIS within 24-hours, and
       scheduled for pick up by the NSF.
    4.3. Documentation: Ensure all completed maintenance documents for NWRM are
    maintained. Documentation can include: build-up sheets, AFMC Form 105, Workload
    Record; AFMC Form 959, Work Control Document; MIS generated WCDs; DD Form 1907,
    Signature and Tally Record; Daily End-Item Production Account Visibility and Cross-
    Reference Listing (G004L-L2A) with transactions that increased or decreased the work order
    balance; DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document; Air Force Technical Order
    (AFTO) Form 95, Significant Historical Data; and DRMS Form 145, Demilitarization
    Certificate.
       4.3.1. 309 MXW schedulers will maintain the appropriate documentation in the work
       order jacket file for 2 years.
    4.4. Cannibalization or Reclamation: All cannibalization or reclamation maintenance
    actions of NWRM will be accomplished at the direction of the item manager (IM) using
    AFMC Form 206, Temporary Work Request.
       4.4.1. Non-NWRM kits containing NWRM subcomponents that are ordered for complete
       disassembly, will not be ordered using due-in from overhaul (DIOH) procedures. If the
       kit is not completely disassembled and will be returned to supply, DIOH procedures will
       apply. NOTE: Turn in all subcomponents using found-on-base procedures.
    4.5. End Item Repair: All NWRM end items will be ordered in the MIS. NOTE: When the
    scheduler is ordering condition codes A, B, or C items, ensure the order priority is changed
    from C3 to B3. Wholesale and Retail Receiving and Shipping System (WARRS/D035K)
    will not automatically generate a requisition for priority C3s. Change the demand code to N
    (non-recurring) to prevent creating a stock level in WARRS/D035K.
       4.5.1. The expeditor/scheduler will review data elements documented on the DD Form
       1348-1; DD Form 1907; DD Form 1574, Serviceable Tag - Materiel; DD Form 1574-1,
       Serviceable Label - Materiel; DD Form 1575, Suspended Tag – Materiel; DD Form
       1575-1, Suspended Label – Materiel; DD Form 1576, Test/Modification Tag – Materiel;
       DD Form 1576-1, Test/Modification Label – Materiel; DD Form 1577, Unserviceable
       (Condemned) Tag – Materiel; DD Form 1577-1, Unserviceable (Condemned) Label –
       Materiel; DD Form 1577-2, Unserviceable (Reparable) Tag – Materiel; and DD Form
       1577-3, Unserviceable (Reparable) Label – Materiel, for accuracy. If the NSN, quantity
       and SN match, accept the item.
309MXWI20-101 2 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 5


         4.5.1.1. In the event there is a discrepancy associated with the receipt process (i.e.,
         overages, shortages, damaged shipments, misidentified property), the
         expeditor/scheduler will not accept the item. The scheduler will notify the NWRM
         retail item manager (RIM) to delete or clear the in transit records for DIOH balances.
         If the discrepant item is an issue to the PST, the PST will process a turn-in through
         ABOM/NIMMS before giving the item to the NSF.
         4.5.1.2. The 309 MXW Scheduler will:
             4.5.1.2.1. Ensure the item is placed on work within 24-hours of receipt from the
             NSF. Place a signed copy of the DD Form 1907 in the work control jacket.
             4.5.1.2.2. Ensure WCDs are properly annotated with the SN and PN of the item.
             4.5.1.2.3. Review all NWRM transactions; clear or correct rejects and exceptions
             that appear on the G004L-L2A daily listing.
             4.5.1.2.4. Ensure any wash-post transactions, inventory adjustments, or reversal
             transactions affecting the accountable balances in WARRS/D035K for NWRM
             items in the MRO process, are reviewed by the scheduling supervisor,
             exchangeable production support chief, 309 MXW Group NWRM ROs and 309
             MXW NWRM RO prior to completing the transaction.
             NOTE: This is to ensure all research and analysis has been completed; prior to
             the transactions being processed.
     4.5.2. All NWRM SNs removed or installed during a maintenance action, will be put
     into the Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) no later than the
     end of the next duty day after completion of the maintenance action.
     NOTE: Until REMIS is updated to allow tracking of embedded subcomponents that are
     installed or uninstalled, maintenance actions will be document or captured in
     MABSM/IMPRESA by 309th Missile Maintenance Group and 309th Commodities
     Maintenance Group.
  4.6. NWRM Turn-In Process. The scheduler and PST will use normal turn-in processing for
  NWRM.
  NOTE: If an erroneous transaction is processed, (i.e., wrong condition code) contact
  NWRM RIM to correct it before continuing with the next transaction.
     4.6.1. The scheduler creates the DD Form 1907. The SN of the NWRM will be
     annotated on the DD Form 1907. The SN must match the item and the information on
     DD Form 1574; DD Form 1574-1; DD Form 1575; DD Form 1575-1; DD Form 1576;
     DD Form 1576-1; DD Form 1577; DD Form 1577-1; DD Form 1577-2; and DD Form
     1577-3. Coordinate via email with NSF for pick-up of the NWRM item. Follow up with
     NSF in 24-hour intervals until item is picked up, and notify the 309 MXW group RO
     when circumstances impact the turn-in process.
     4.6.2. The scheduler will file a copy of the signed/completed DD Form 1907 (the return)
     in the completed work order jacket file.
     4.6.3. Turn-in of NWRM items by the PST will be accomplished in ABOM/NIMMS.
 6                                                      309MXWI20-101 2 NOVEMBER 2011


        4.6.4. The PST will:
            4.6.4.1. Prepares DD Form 1907, and ensure the SN on the NWRM item matches the
            turn-in document and the DD Forms stated in 4.5.1.
            4.6.4.2. Coordinate via email with NSF for pick-up of the NWRM item.
            4.6.4.3. Forward a copy of the signed DD Form 1907 to the scheduler for filing in the
            work order jacket.
        4.6.5. For NWRM items packed by the 309 MXW, ensure NSF personnel are present,
        prior to packing for SN verification.
     4.7. Missing Components. When an inducted higher level assembly (HLA) has missing
     NWRM components, or an NWRM HLA is missing any components, the technician will
     cease work and immediately report it to the shop supervisor. The supervisor will notify (via
     email), and provide the scheduler with the details of the missing item.
        4.7.1. The scheduler will:
            4.7.1.1. Notify (via email) the IM and the program manager for disposition
            instructions.
            NOTE: Include the 309 MXW NWRM RO, 309 MXW group NWRM ROs, and
            shop supervisor on all email correspondence.
            4.7.1.2. . Follow up with the IM in 24-hour intervals until disposition instructions
            are received.
        4.7.2. If disposition instructions are not received in 72-hours, document the missing
        items on the back of the DD Form 1577, and return the item to the NSF in condition ―F‖.
        Notify the IM via email of the turn-in.
     4.8. Aircraft Repair. Aircraft arriving for MRO process will be inspected and inventoried to
     verify NWRM was removed prior to arrival at the depot. If NWRM was not removed, notify
     the 309 MXW NWRM RO and await instructions.
5. Inventory and Reconciliation.
     5.1. The shop scheduler will perform a monthly physical inventory of all NWRM in the
     shop. The NSN, SN, physical count, work order, and document number will be documented
     on an AF IMT 3132 V2, General Purpose Form, or AF IMT 3126 V1, General Purpose
     Form.      Retain for 1 month, and discard when the next monthly physical
     inventory/reconciliation is conducted.
     5.2. The physical count will be reconciled against the appropriate MIS, and the AFMC Form
     105 (scheduler‘s workbook).
     5.3. If there is a discrepancy between any of the MIS records, AFMC Form 105, or physical
     counts, causative research will be performed by the scheduler.
        5.3.1. Causative research can include, but is not limited to: reviewing transactions on the
        G004L-L2A listing that did not pass edits in the MIS, if there is an overage in the shop,
        were the items ordered by a PST to be installed in the next higher assembly (NHA), or
309MXWI20-101 2 NOVEMBER 2011                                                               7


     was the overage a result of a reclaim or save action and the item has not been turned in.
     Ensure MIS records match WARRS/D035K records.
  5.4. When discrepancies affecting balances in WARRS/D035K are found during the
  reconciliation, contact the NWRM RIM for corrective actions.
6. DEMIL of NWRM.
  6.1. All DEMIL actions performed on NWRM will be IAW technical orders, and/or detailed
  special instructions documented on an AFMC Form 206 or project directive. If instructions
  are not sufficient, submit an AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request
  and Reply.
  6.2. The scheduler orders NWRM items for DEMIL using the MIS, and creates the WCD.
  The WCD will contain as a minimum: SN, PN, and NSN of the NWRM item.
  6.3. A child WCD will be created for NWRM subassemblies subject to maintenance actions
  (i.e., check and test prior to turn in).
  6.4. All NWRM items removed from the NHA will be documented by SN and PN on an
  AFTO IMT 95. All completed DEMIL actions will be recorded in the MIS by the end of the
  next duty day.
  6.5. The completed DRMS Form 145 will be filed in the schedulers work order jacket. The
  scheduler will send an electronic copy of the DRMS Form 145 to the IM when no scrap
  material is generated from the DEMIL actions, or a copy of the DRMS Form 145 to DLA
  Disposition Services, if scrap material is generated during the DEMIL actions.
     6.5.1. All turn-ins to DLA Disposition Services will be accomplished using the DRMS
     Electronic Turn-In Document System. The original DEMIL code will be annotated on
     the turn-in document.
