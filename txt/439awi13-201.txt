        1,015 feet from the landing threshold.

2.13. Precision Approach Critical Areas (See Attachment 4).
     2.13.1. Airfield Operations is responsible for the protection of the ILS critical areas. These areas are
     defined as follows:
        2.13.1.1. Localizer – A rectangular area parallel and perpendicular to the antenna array extending
        from the antenna array 2,000 feet towards the approach end of the runway and 150 feet on each
        side the centerline of the approach course. It includes a 50-foot extension behind the antenna.
        2.13.1.2. Glide Slope – A fan-shaped area that extends from the glideslope antenna 1,300 feet
        toward the approach end of the runway (or to the end of the runway, whichever is greater.) It cov-
        ers an area 40 degrees each side of a line drawn through the glide slope antenna and parallel to the
        runway centerline.
     2.13.2. ILS Critical Areas are protected by means of establishing a controlled area or physically sep-
     arating the critical areas from vehicular travel routes in order to prevent vehicles of all types from
     interfering with the radiation pattern emitted by the antennae. Even the smallest interference can cause
     a significant deviation in the radiation pattern and affect the course of flight for landing aircraft.
     2.13.3. Pad 5 is marked with an instrument hold line plus an INST sign and Pad 23 is marked with a
     VFR hold line plus an INST sign. Tower will direct/hold aircraft outside the precision approach criti-
     cal area when ceilings are below 800 feet and visibility is less than 2 miles and in accordance with
     FAA Order 7110.65.
NOTE: Regardless of weather conditions, the Tower will hold all Group IV heavy aircraft short of Taxi-
way P on Taxiway S when any aircraft is established on an ILS approach to Runway 05 in accordance
with AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures. The vertical stabilizers of Group IV aircraft become controlling
obstructions and therefore affect the instrument landing minima when these aircraft are allowed to hold at
the instrument hold line.

2.14. Servicing Radar Approach Control (FAA, Bradley TRACON). Bradley Approach Control is
the Federal Aviation Administration Air Traffic Control facility at Bradley International Airport, Windsor
Locks, Connecticut, servicing a 40NM radius up to 10,000 feet MSL. It provides basic radar service to
Westover ARB. An air traffic control (ATC) clearance is required for all aircraft entering the Windsor
Locks Class C Airspace. The Westover 439 OSS/OSAA is the base liaison to FAA, Bradley TRACON.
439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005                                                                        13

   2.15.1. Pad 23: TACAN MAG Bearing 017°/197° DME 0.4NM.
   2.15.2. Pad 05: TACAN MAG Bearing 054°/234° DME 1.5NM.
   2.15.3. Taxiway Y: VORTAC MAG Bearing 135°/315° DME 0.9NM.

2.16. Airspace Definitions.
   2.16.1. Westover Air Traffic Control Tower is responsible for control of all Instrument Flight Rules
   (IFR) and VFR traffic in the Westover Class D Airspace. The Westover Class D airspace is defined in
   the Code of Federal Regulations and FAA Order 7400.9, Airspace Designations and Reporting
   Points. It is depicted on the sectional charts and at Attachment 5, Westover ARB Class D Airspace,
   as that area of airspace from the surface to 2,700 feet MSL and bounded by a circle with a radius of
   5.7 SM originating at the Westover Airport Reference Point (ARP).
   2.16.2. Operationally and by letter of agreement with FAA Bradley TRACON, the Class D airspace
   exists during Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) during the hours the Westover airport is open
   (normally 0700L through 2300L, 7 days per week).
   2.16.3. During periods of Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) or when the Westover Aero-
   drome is closed, the Westover Class D airspace reverts to Class E airspace extending upward from
   700 feet above the surface within a 7.4-mile radius of Westover ARB excluding that airspace within
   the Westfield Class E airspace area.
   2.16.4. The airspace between 2,700 feet MSL and 3,200 feet MSL shall not be utilized by either
   Westover Tower or Bradley Approach Control without advance interfacility coordination.
   2.16.5. The Westover Class D airspace abuts the Westfield Class D airspace to the west.

2.17. Air Traffic Control Frequencies. Westover Tower frequencies are 348.75/134.85 MHz and
Westover Ground frequencies are 275.8/118.35 MHz. All other frequencies are listed in the DoD FLIP.

2.18. Flight Services Available. Full Service B flight services are available from Westover Airfield
Management Operations. Refer to the General Planning (GP), IFR Supplement, Airfield Suitability/
Restrictions Report (ASRR) or contact Westover Airfield Management Operations (DSN 589-2951/372.2
MHz) for more information.

2.19. Waivers to Airfield/Airspace Criteria. All waivers will be coordinated through the Westover
Airfield Operations Flight.

2.20. Arm/De-Arm Quick Check Areas. The Arming/Quick Check area for Runway 05 is located on
Pad 5; the De-Arming area for Runway 05 is located on Pad 23; the Arming/Quick Check area for Run-
way 23 is located on Pad 23; and the De-Arming area for Runway 23 is Pad 5. Weapons carrying aircraft
requiring arming or de-arming shall use Runway 05/23 whenever possible.

2.21. Aircraft Parking Plan. The Westover aircraft parking plan is available in 439 Maintenance Oper-
ating Instruction 21-127, Aircraft Parking Plan.
14                                                                  439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005


     2.21.1. Normal Aircraft Parking (See Attachment 14, East Ramp Aircraft Parking). Westover
     assigned C-5s will normally be parked on the east ramp. There are currently 16 marked spots on the
     east ramp. Fourteen of these spots have adequate clearances for C-5 parking. The remaining two
     spots, Echo 15 and Echo 16, are also marked but do not have optimum wingtip clearances for C-5s.
     These spots are more appropriate for non-wide body aircraft. Additionally, there is room for one (1)
     C-5 aircraft near the northwest corner of the DC Hangar (building 7000). This spot is typically
     reserved for aircraft designated as parts donor aircraft and is referred to as Echo Point 5.
     2.21.2. Alternate Parking Locations (See Attachment 15, North Ramp Aircraft Parking). Home sta-
     tion aircraft are not normally parked on the north ramp; however, up to five C-5 aircraft may be
     parked in a nose-to-tail configuration, parallel to Runway 15/33 if required. Parking spots for this con-
     figuration are not permanently marked and therefore require prior coordination with base operations.
     2.21.3. Additional Maintenance Parking Areas (See Attachment 16, Additional Maintenance Air-
     craft Parking). There are three additional C-5 parking spaces (Sierra 1, Sierra 2 and Sierra 3) available
     on the south end of the Pull-Through and DC Hangars. When parking aircraft on these spots, care
     must be taken not to block emergency egress routes from these buildings when other aircraft are han-
     gared.

2.22. Hot Pit Refueling Areas. There are no hot pit refueling areas at Westover ARB.

                       FLIGHT PLANNING AND GROUND OPERATIONS

3.1. Aircrew Information.
   3.1.1. Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) will brief all transient aircraft commanders on
   aerodrome hazards, status of navigational aids (NAVAIDS), noise abatement, bird watch conditions
   and hazards, and rescue/fire-fighting capability. Westover-based flying units will develop their own
   briefing procedures to ensure aircrews are advised of airfield status and applicable base flying instruc-
   tion requirements.
   3.1.2. Notices to Airmen (NOTAM). AMOPS is the designated NOTAM Dispatch Facility. Tower is
   the designated NOTAM monitor facility. AMOPS will provide pre-coordinated NOTAMs to the
   Tower for inclusion on the ATIS broadcast. Additionally, base agencies may obtain NOTAM infor-
   mation by calling AMOPS or by checking one of the following web sites: https://www.not-
   ams.jcs.mil or https://www.notams.faa.gov.
NOTE: AMOPS also receives and disseminates NOTAM information from Westover Metropolitan Air-
port for areas controlled by the Director, Civil Aviation.
   3.1.3. Weather. A complete weather brief for non-Integrated Flight Management (IFM) originating
   missions is available at the base weather station (Building 7091). All other briefings must be procured
   from the 15 OWS Weather Hub or TACC at Scott AFB.
   3.1.4. Storage of Classified Materials. Aircrew can store all classified material at the Westover Com-
   mand Post (Building 7091). Base assigned COMSEC will be stored and issued at AMOPS.
   3.1.5. Prior Permission Required (PPR) Procedures. PPR information and procedures are published in
   the DoD IFR Supplement and in 439 OSAA OIs 13-01 and 13-02.

3.2. Flight Planning Responsibilities.
   3.2.1. Departing Aircraft.
       3.2.1.1. All military aircraft departing Westover ARB military ramp with a flight plan listing
       KCEF as the initial departure station must file either an IFR or VFR flight plan with AMOPS in
       accordance with flight information publication (FLIP) General Planning (GP) and AFI 11-202,
       Vol. 3.
       3.2.1.2. Aircrews are encouraged (if not directed by regulatory guidance) to check the Avian Haz-
       ard Advisory System (AHAS) and Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) for the latest bird activity for
       enroute, departure, and arrival locations. Computers and current print outs are available in the
       flight planning room at AMOPS.
   3.2.2. Entering Flight Plans.
       3.2.2.1. AMOPS has the primary responsibility for entering flight plans into AIS-R. Tower may
       also enter flight plans via the FDIO on a workload permitting basis provided they coordinate with
       AMOPS and ensure a flight plan is on file for departing, originating aircraft.
       3.2.2.2. When advised by Tower that the flight data system (FDIO) is inoperative, AMOPS will
       forward flight plan information as requested on all inbound and outbound aircraft to the tower.
16                                                                  439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005


3.3. Ground Operations.
     3.3.1. Ground Control. Aircraft shall monitor Westover ground control frequency during all ground
     operations from initial engine start to shutdown. Before taxiing, pilots of all aircraft will contact
     Ground to indicate their intentions and receive taxi clearance. Ground will not permit military aircraft
     to taxi until AMOPS has received a filed DD Form 175, Flight Plan, Military, or DD Form 1801,
     International Flight Plan, DoD, and notified Tower. Military aircraft will not be cleared for takeoff
     without a flight plan on file in Base Operations.
     3.3.2. Transient Alert Procedures. When notified by Airfield Management Operations that a transient
     is inbound, the Transient Alert dispatcher will dispatch a "follow-me" vehicle to assist the aircraft to
     parking. AMOPS shall make every effort to afford Transient Alert at least 30-minutes advance notifi-
     cation. Westover Transient Alert provides standard transient services as defined by the base operating
     services contract and published in the DoD IFR Supplement. Transient aircraft not familiar with
     routes will be provided progressive taxi instructions by the tower and "follow-me" assistance from
     transient alert.
     3.3.3. Taxiing with Live Ordnance. All aircraft loaded with armed forward firing ordnance will taxi
     so as to avoid pointing their ordnance at any passenger-carrying aircraft. Aircrew shall advise Tower
     when operating with armed forward firing ordnance prior to taxiing.
     3.3.4. During periods of low ceiling and visibility (specifically when the ceiling is below 800 feet and
     the visibility is less than 2 miles), aircraft will be held outside the precision approach critical areas
     (see Attachment 4).

3.4. Distinguished Visitor (DV) and Other Special Mission Notification Procedures.
     3.4.1. Airfield Management Operations shall notify the following agencies for all DVs or other spe-
     cial missions inbound to Westover ARB:
        3.4.1.1. Tower.
        3.4.1.2. Transient Alert.
        3.4.1.3. Command Post.
        3.4.1.4. Wing Protocol (Does not apply after duty hours).
        3.4.1.5. Air Transportation Operations Center (ATOC).
        3.4.1.6. Central Security Control (CSC).
        3.4.1.7. This notification will include the appropriate VIP code and name of DV, the agency the
        DV is visiting, the call sign and type aircraft, the aircraft parking location, the estimated time of
        arrival, and the actual time of arrival.
     3.4.2. For other special mission aircraft, AMOPS should utilize the DV inbound checklist and provide
     any information required for that type mission.
     3.4.3. AMOPS shall inform tower of the requirement for a 15-mile call in time for the information to
     be useful.
     3.4.4. The Tower will notify AMOPS concerning DV or other special mission inbounds when the air-
     craft is 15 flying miles from the runway in use unless other otherwise specified.
439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005                                                                             17


   3.4.5. Westover is not an alternate landing site for the space shuttle or space shuttle carrier.

3.5. Flight Information Publications (FLIP). 439 OSS/OSAA is the wing DoD FLIP publications
monitor. All requests/changes to FLIPs will be submitted through Westover AMOPS.

3.6. Bird/Wildlife Control Program. A bird hazard exists at and around Westover ARB due to resident
and migrating bird species. Daily and seasonal bird movements create varying degrees of hazardous con-
ditions. Other wildlife such as deer, coyote, and beaver also present a hazard to aircraft in and around the
airport environment.
   3.6.1. The Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. The BASH program is maintained by the
   wing flying safety office (439 AW/SE) and jointly executed through a cooperative effort between
   Safety, the US Department of Agriculture, AMOPS, flying units, and maintenance personnel. Person-
   nel involved in the BASH program and any aircrew operating at Westover ARB are to be familiar
   with 439th Airlift Wing Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan 91-212. 439 AW/SE is the OPR for this plan.
   3.6.2. US Air Force Safety Center Tools. Access to the Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) and the Avian
   Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) is available in the flight planning room at AMOPS.
   3.6.3. Determining Bird Watch Conditions (BWC). Airfield Management and/or the Tower watch
   supervisor will determine the BWC. Agencies spotting wildlife on the aerodrome shall report activity
   immediately to AMOPS or the Tower. The AM, DAM, AMOS, and Tower Watch Supervisor have
   the authority to raise the BWC. Only the AM, after coordinating with appropriate agencies (AOM,
   OG/CC, Safety, etc), can lower the BWC.
   3.6.4. Increase in BWC. A BWC of moderate or severe shall be included on the ATIS broadcast and
   posted in Airfield Management Operations.

3.7. Flightline Vehicle and Pedestrian Operations. All flightline wheeled vehicles and pedestrian
operations shall be conducted in accordance with 439 AWI 13-202, Vehicle Operations on the Airfield. A
complete list of call signs can be found in Table A2.3 of this instruction.

3.8. Control of Ramp Areas. In addition to duties listed in AFI 13-213, the Chief, Airfield Management
(CAM) is responsible for assigning transient aircraft parking locations. Parking space priorities are based
on mission requirements. Transient Alert and Maintenance Job Control may make recommendations to
the CAM for transient parking, however the CAM will make the final determination.

3.9. Control of Vehicular Ground Traffic.
   3.9.1. Movement Area Definition. A movement area at an Air Force installation is any airport area
   where aircraft can be taxied including ramp and apron areas. At Westover ARB, the movement area
   shall be defined as all runway, taxiways, aprons, and ramps with the exception of Taxiway Delta
   (which is closed). Refer to the diagram at Attachment 3, Movement Area/Controlled Movement
   Area.
       3.9.1.1. Personnel requiring access to any portion of the movement area must coordinate with Air-
       field Management prior to entry.
       3.9.1.2. Vehicles, pedestrians, and aircraft operating in the movement area, but outside the con-
       trolled movement area, shall monitor the Tower/Ramp Net or air traffic control frequencies to the
18                                                                  439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005


        maximum extent possible to maintain situational awareness. Tow operators shall monitor the
        Tower/Ramp Net and receive tower approval prior to towing in this area. Personnel shall be con-
        tinually aware of their surroundings and periodically observe the tower for light gun signals.
     3.9.2. Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Definition. At Westover airport, the portion of the move-
     ment area where tower control/communication is mandatory (hereafter referred to as the Controlled
     Movement Area) is defined as: Runway 05/23, Runway 15/33, overruns, Taxiways A, C (including
     the Compass Rose), F, G, L, N, Y, Pad 5 and Pad 23 west of the instrument hold lines, Pad 19, Pad 33,
     and the infield areas parallel to the runways on both sides out to and including 100 feet from the pave-
     ment’s edge. Refer to the diagram at Attachment 3.
        3.9.2.1. Westover Tower controls all ground traffic in the CMA. Vehicles and pedestrians operat-
        ing in this area shall establish and maintain 2-way radio communication with the Tower or be
        escorted by another vehicle or pedestrian that possesses this capability.
NOTE: Radio contact with the tower and permission to enter is mandatory prior to crossing any bound-
ary of the controlled movement area.
        3.9.2.2. Before entering a runway surface for any reason, permission must be obtained from the
        tower even if the runway is temporarily closed or operations are temporarily suspended. When
        escorting non-radio equipped vehicles on runway surfaces, the escort agency must provide enough
        escorts to enable them to stay with non-radio equipped vehicle. At no time will non-radio
        equipped vehicle be left without an escort on a runway surface.
        3.9.2.3. Vehicles operating in the movement area must stop at all intersecting taxiways and run-
        ways. Final responsibility for avoidance of taxiing aircraft rests with vehicle operators. Extreme
        caution should be used when driving on the airfield.
        3.9.2.4. Personnel shall use the FM (LMR) Ramp/Tower Net as the primary method to contact the
        tower. Secondary means of communication with the Tower shall be via the CE LMR Net. Cellular
        telephones are not an appropriate means of communication with air traffic control while operating
        in the CMA. Personnel operating in this environment shall avoid the use of air traffic control
        UHF/VHF frequencies.
     3.9.3. When tower personnel wish to direct a vehicle off the runway and cannot establish radio con-
     tact, flashing the runway edge lights several times will constitute a runway exit command. Vehicle
     operators on the runway observing the flashing runway lights will immediately depart the runway.
     When recalled from the runway, vehicle operators will exit the runway at the nearest taxiway and
     position themselves behind the runway hold lines at least 100 feet from the runway edge. A good
     visual reference for 100 feet from the runway edge is outside the distance remaining markers. Vehicle
     operators will continuously watch the tower for light gun signals.
     3.9.4. Westover Tower is authorized to approve altitude restricted low approaches over vehicles,
     equipment, or personnel operating on the runway. A restriction of not less than 500 feet (1,000 for
     heavy jet aircraft) above ground level (AGL) may be authorized.
     3.9.5. During evacuation of the Tower, vehicles on the runway will be instructed to exit the runway.
     While the Tower is unmanned, vehicle operations on the controlled movement areas will be limited to
     emergency response operations only.
439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005                                                                              19


  3.9.6. All vehicles, except Drop Zone Control Vehicles, are restricted from operating within the lat-
  eral boundaries of any active drop zone (see Attachment 6, Westover ARB Beanbag Drop Zone).
  Drop Zone activities are published daily in the NOTAM/AIRAD Advisory Sheet.
  3.9.7. 439 OSS/OSAA is the OPR for the Flightline Driving Program. All personnel driving on the
  flightline must be qualified in accordance with AFJMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle
  Driver, Chapter 25, AFI 13-213, and 439 AWI 13-202 and possess a valid AF IMT 483, Certificate
  of Competency. All contractors must receive an airfield briefing from Base Operations before operat-
  ing on the flightline. (If AF IMT 483 is lost or misplaced by the user, outside of one year from the
  original pass date, individuals will be re-tested. Inside of one year, individuals will produce their doc-
  umentation of training and certification form to justify the issuance of a new AF IMT 483).
     3.9.7.1. Westover ARB does not allow POV access to the flight line except for special events (e.g.
     airshows) and for personnel required to transit flightline areas in their POV. In these cases, person-
     nel must display a flightline driving permit (in either placard or sticker form) issued by 439 OSS/
     OSAA and must possess a current and valid AF IMT 483, Certificate of Competency, endorsed
     for driving on the Westover flightline.
     3.9.7.2. Only power production and airfield electrician personnel and their respective vehicles
     may operate within 100 feet of the runway edge during aircraft operations. All vehicles must con-
     tact the tower prior to entering this area. These individuals will maintain 2-way radio communica-
     tion with the Tower and will remain off the paved surfaces. Airfield Management will notify the
     Tower of all such individuals. Men and equipment within 100 feet of the runway edge will be
     removed for arrivals/departures of large or heavy weight class aircraft. Air Traffic Control is
     responsible for advising inbound/outbound aircraft of men and equipment within 100 feet of the
     runway edge.
     3.9.7.3. All vehicles (including contractor vehicles) will be equipped with markings and lighting
     in accordance with T.O. 36-1-191 and FAA Advisory Circular 150/5210-5. Vehicles operating in
     the controlled movement area will activate their flashing lights/beacons if available. If not avail-
     able, headlights and emergency flashers shall be used.
     3.9.7.4. Flightline Driving Violations and Penalties (see 439 AWI 13-202). Gross or repeated vio-
     lations of safety or flightline driving rules, or an overall demonstrated lack of ability on the part of
     the certificate holder will result in a suspension of flightline driving privileges, surrender of the
     certificate, or revocation of the certificate.
         3.9.7.4.1. The Airfield Manager, or designated representative is authorized to confiscate AF
         Form 483 and/or flightline POV passes or decals.
         3.9.7.4.2. The Airfield Manager, or designated representative is authorized to revoke air-
         field-driving privileges of individuals violating the provisions of this instruction and/or 439
         AWI 13-202 or performing unsafe acts on the airfield.
         3.9.7.4.3. Any supervisor in the driver’s chain of command may suspend a driver’s certificate.
         All suspensions will be reported to the flightline driving program manager and airfield man-
         ager. Failure to complete annual refresher training (or if there is no documentation of annual
         training) is cause for competency card suspension.
20                                                                439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005


           3.9.7.4.4. All certificate holders will surrender their AF Form 483 upon request by the unit
           flightline driving program manager and/or Airfield Management personnel. Surrendered cer-
           tificates will be forwarded to Airfield Management.
           3.9.7.4.5. Revocation. AF Form 483 may be revoked by the unit flightline driving program
           manager, airfield manager, AOM, or designated representative. Once revoked, another certifi-
           cate will not be reissued without the explicit approval of the airfield manager.
           3.9.7.4.6. Violations of the airfield driving instruction within a 12-month period will carry the
           following penalties:

3.19. Aircraft Towing Operations. Procedures for towing aircraft are described in 439th Maintenance
Operating Instruction 21-116, Towing and Hangaring of Aircraft. In addition to the requirements of para-
graph 3.9.1.2. of this instruction, aircraft tow teams shall adhere to the following:
     3.19.1. Aircraft towing operations will normally be conducted on “D” (Tower) Net.
     3.19.2. Prior to aircraft movement, the tow supervisor will request tow clearance through the MOC,
     who in-turn requests tow clearance through the Command Post (CP). Once tow clearance is granted
     through the CP, MOC will relay the clearance to the tow supervisor. The supervisor will then switch
     to “D” Net and request clearance from ground control to move the aircraft. The tow team will remain
     on “D” Net throughout the tow (except as specified above). Once the tow is complete, the tow super-
     visor will inform ground control that the tow is complete.
     3.19.3. Prior to aircraft movement, the tow team supervisor will ensure the towpath and destination is
     clear and free of obstructions.
     3.19.4. Any ground emergency discovered by maintenance personnel will be relayed to the tower via
     LMR radio for activation of the Primary Crash Alarm System in addition to any emergency reporting
     required by Maintenance operating procedures.
439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005                                                                              25


                                                Chapter 4

                                    AIR TRAFFIC OPERATIONS

4.1. Local Aircraft Priorities. Priorities are supplemental to those directed in FAA Order 7110.65. Pri-
orities listed in FAA Order 7110.65 take precedence over those listed below.
   4.1.1. Aircraft with hung/misfired live or inert ordnance.
   4.1.2. Priority missions to include banner missions.
   4.1.3. Controlled departure time aircraft.
   4.1.4. Distinguished visitor arrivals/departures (code 1- 7).
   4.1.5. Full-stop arrivals.
   4.1.6. IFR departures on a DD 175 or DD 1801 flight plan.
   4.1.7. IFR/VFR practice approaches.
   4.1.8. Deviations may be granted only after 439 OG/CC approval.

4.2. Departures.
   4.2.1. Aircraft will be assigned departure routes of flight consistent with the Yankee Hub preferred
   routing program.
   4.2.2. VFR Departures. Aircraft departing VFR and desiring flight following will make their request
   through Westover Ground Control prior to switching to Tower.
   4.2.3. Intersection Departures (See Attachment 7, Intersection Departure Distances). There are no
   restrictions for intersection departures.
   4.2.4. Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA). MARSA procedures
   are not applied for base assigned aircraft. Transient aircraft use of MARSA must be defined in a Letter
   of Agreement.

4.3. Protection of the 360º Overhead Pattern. Aircraft departing or performing a go around, missed
approach or low approach will not climb above 2,000 MSL until beyond the departure end of the runway.
If the overhead pattern is active, Tower will advise all aircraft of the departure restriction.

4.4. Opposite Direction Traffic.
   4.4.1. Opposite direction departure or arrivals will not be authorized when the certified tower radar
   display (STARS) is inoperative. The tower or Bradley Approach will coordinate opposite direction
   departures or arrivals on an individual basis. Coordination will include the phrase "OPPOSITE
   DIRECTION DEPARTURE (ARRIVAL),” in addition to the numerical designation of the runway
   used for the opposite direction operation. The tower and Bradley Approach will jointly have approval/
   denial authority for all opposite direction operations (i.e. either facility may deny the request based on
   existing/projected traffic).
   4.4.2. Opposite direction operations will be approved when an operational necessity exists (traffic
   permitting). Opposite direction operations will not impede full stop arrivals or any departure.
26                                                                   439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005


     4.4.3. The following separation standards for opposite direction operations shall be used:
        4.4.3.1. Arrival versus Arrival. The succeeding aircraft will be no closer than 10 mile final until
        the proceeding aircraft passes the landing threshold.
        4.4.3.2. Arrival versus Departure. Opposite direction departures (including opposite direction
        arrivals completing other than a full-stop landing) will not be approved if an arriving aircraft is
        within 10 flying miles on final to the runway in use.
        4.4.3.3. Departure or Low/Missed Approach versus Arrival. Opposite direction arrivals will not
        be permitted to approach within 10 flying miles on final of the runway until departing aircraft is
        airborne and has turned at least 45 degrees from runway heading or approved vertical separation is
        attained.
        4.4.3.4. If either aircraft is VFR, the opposite direction cutoff is 10 flying miles.
        4.4.3.5. Aircraft in the VFR traffic pattern will not turn base until departing IFR/VFR aircraft are
        airborne and beyond the VFR pattern base leg.

4.5. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) Standards. RSRS separation shall not be applied to
any aircraft operating at Westover ARB.

4.6. Unusual Maneuvers.
     4.6.1. Approving Unusual Maneuvers. Air Traffic Control shall not approve pilot requests to conduct
     unusual maneuvers unless the maneuver is essential to the performance of flight. Unusual maneuvers
     include unnecessary low passes, unscheduled fly-bys, practice instrument approaches to altitudes
     below specified minima, fighter demonstrations, etc.
     4.6.2. Requests for Unusual Maneuvers. All requests to conduct an unusual maneuver, specifically
     maneuvers where an FAA or USAF waiver is required, must be coordinated through 439 OSS/OSA
     and approved by the wing commander (439 AW/CC) or designated representative not later than 60
     days prior to the event.
     4.6.3. Communications. All communications during approved unusual maneuvers will be on Tower
     frequencies unless otherwise previously coordinated.

4.7. VFR Terminal Area Procedures. (See Attachment 7 through Attachment 13 and Attachment
19)
     4.7.1. Westover ARB VFR Terminal Area consists of the Class D airspace depicted in Attachment 4.
     Any planned deviation from the Westover ARB terminal area both lateral and vertical (as defined in
     paragraph 2.16.) shall be coordinated through Westover Tower to ensure adequate aircraft separation.
     4.7.2. Weather requirements:
        4.7.2.1. Rectangular Pattern - Ceilings at or above 2300 feet MSL and visibility of 3 miles or
        greater.
        4.7.2.2. Initial/Overhead Pattern - Ceilings at or above 2800 feet MSL and visibility of 3 miles or
        greater.
439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005                                                                              27


       4.7.2.3. Light Aircraft/Helicopter Pattern – Ceilings at or above 1800 feet MSL and visibility 3
       miles or greater.
   4.7.3. Pattern descriptions.
       4.7.3.1. Rectangular Pattern - Downwind leg to the east or north of the runway. Pattern altitude
       will be 2000 feet MSL for heavy aircraft and 1000 feet MSL for light aircraft or helicopters.
       4.7.3.2. Initial/Overhead Pattern - Pattern altitude is 2500 feet MSL and all turns are made to the
       east (i.e.: Runway 05 – right turns, Runway 23 – left turns). Aircraft shall enter initial at 3-5 NM
       from the runway. The overhead/initial pattern is normally entered from IFR vectors to initial. The
       IFR flight plan for aircraft conducting an overhead maneuver is automatically cancelled at the ini-
       tial point or when the aircraft is instructed to contact tower.
   4.7.4. Unless otherwise directed by the tower, closed traffic shall be made at departure end. The alti-
   tude specified will correspond to the altitude of the pattern for which the closed traffic is established
   (i.e. rectangular pattern – 2000/1000 feet MSL, overhead pattern – 2500 feet MSL).
   4.7.5. Local Area Restrictions. All aircraft except emergencies shall avoid overflight of the base
   proper.
   4.7.6. Visual Reporting Points.
       4.7.6.1. Holyoke Range. Mountains 7NM north of Westover.
       4.7.6.2. Quabbin Reservoir/Windsor Dam. The south end of the reservoir 10NM northeast of
       Westover.
       4.7.6.3. Springfield Reservoir. The reservoir 6NM east-northeast of Westover.
       4.7.6.4. Ludlow, Town of. Town 4NM southeast of Westover.
       4.7.6.5. Springfield, City of. City 5NM south-southwest of Westover.
       4.7.6.6. Holyoke, City of. City 4NM west of Westover.
       4.7.6.7. Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90). Major roadway 2NM south of Westover running
       east-west.
       4.7.6.8. Connecticut River. River 3NM west of Westover running north-south.
       4.7.6.9. Approach and Landing from VFR Reporting Points. At entry points outside the Class D
       airspace, pilots shall remain clear of Class D airspace and contact tower with call sign, entry point,
       flight size, and intentions. When using entry points inside the airspace, pilots shall contact Westo-
       ver Tower prior to entering the airspace and express intentions to proceed to a VFR entry point.
   4.7.7. Initial Re-entry Procedures. When instructed by ATC to re-enter, aircrew shall exit the pattern
   to the east (remain clear of the VFR traffic patterns), climb to 2500 feet MSL and report initial as
   instructed by ATC. Initial reentry will be flown at 2500 feet MSL. There are no published breakout
   procedures at Westover. Breakout instructions will be issued by air traffic control based on current
   traffic conditions.
   4.7.8. Simulated Flame Out (SFO) Approaches. SFOs are not authorized at Westover ARB.

4.8. Tactical Procedures. These procedures apply to Westover assigned C-5 or McGuire assigned
KC-10 tactical operations (hereafter referred to as tactical aircraft) when the Tower is operating. All air-
28                                                                  439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005


craft conducting tactical training will cancel IFR with the appropriate ATC facility prior to commencing
tactical training, but shall keep the current squawk for flight following and pattern sequencing and, as
required, request to keep their IFR flight plan open for subsequent approaches.
NOTE: Using their judgment and experience, controllers shall attempt to give first priority to aircrew
conducting initial tactical training. Initial training is where crews are being certified to perform tactical
maneuvers. Routine tactical proficiency sorties shall be afforded VFR practice approach priority as listed
in paragraph 4.1.
     4.8.1. Tactical aircraft aircrew shall:
        4.8.1.1. Southwest Arrivals. Tactical aircraft arriving from the southwest between the CEF VOR
        135 to the 315 radials should plan to cross the 30 DME arc between 9,500' and 5,500' MSL. This
        will allow Bradley approach control to more readily coordinate air traffic in a very congested area.
        If arriving from the southeast realize that due to Bradley Class C airspace and Westfield/Barnes
        Class D airspace a low altitude arrival may require routing to the northeast side of the tactical
        arrival airspace.
        4.8.1.2. Northeast Arrivals. Tactical aircraft arriving from the northeast between the CEF VOR
        315 to the 135 radials should plan to cross the 30 DME arc below 9,500' and above 1,000'AGL.
        Due to radar coverage limitations below approximately 2,500' MSL radar coverage may be limited
        especially primary targets. This may be a factor if you are using flight following for traffic adviso-
        ries. Additionally, Boston center controls the airspace to within 18nm of Westover on the north-
        east side of the airfield. Therefore, flight following hand offs to Bradley will be closer in than
        those from the southwest.
        4.8.1.3. Tactical Local Sorties. Pilots will file a local IFR flight plan and add “TACTICAL
        OPERATIONS” in the flight plan remarks. The pilot will remain VFR on all tactical approaches.
        On tactical local sorties where multiple patterns are flown pilots will attempt to maintain a ground
        track similar to a normal radar pattern flown to the Northwest side of Westover. Climbout to
        LOUSE then SPRUCE and PINE for Rwy 23 or LOUSE then BIRCH and ELM for Rwy 05. Fly
        the downwind at or above 2,500’MSL. NOTE: Aircrew should be cognizant of the proximity of
        the Westfield Class D airspace. If necessary, crews shall coordinate with Westover Tower to pre-
        vent airspace conflicts. If the tactical ground track was going to be other than LOUSE, SPRUCE,
        and PINE for runway 23 or LOUSE, BIRCH, and ELM for runway 05 the pilot will have to pro-
        vide the routing. Example: "RODD 34 will be tactical for runway 23 via MITE, WILLOW, and
        PINE".
     4.8.2. Westover Tower shall:
        4.8.2.1. Adhere to procedures outlined in the Bradley TRACON/Westover ATCT Letter of
        Agreement.
        4.8.2.2. Assist tactical aircraft aircrew in tactical training to the maximum extent possible.
     4.8.3. Cut Off Points/Protection of airspace and other VFR traffic. Controllers and aircrew should be
     aware that tactical profiles may be discontinued only prior to 2 NM from the center of the Westover
     Class D airspace. Tactical aircraft within 2 NM shall be allowed to continue their maneuver.
     4.8.4. Pilot/Controller Communications.
439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005                                                                               29


       4.8.4.1. Tactical Arrivals: When planning a tactical arrival to tactical aircraft will remain with
       Boston ARTCC and/or Bradley Approach for VFR traffic advisories. When canceling IFR with
       Boston ARTCC crews shall simply inform them of intended altitude and intention to proceed to
       Westover VFR. Example: "BOSTON, REACH 9013, CANCEL IFR, DIRECT WESTOVER,
       DESCENDING TO 2,500'." When canceling IFR with Bradley Approach, or when already VFR
       and are handed off to Bradley from Boston ARTCC, crews shall inform Bradley of arrival inten-
       tions, routing and altitude. Example: "BRADLEY, REACH 9013 VFR FOR A TACTICAL
       APPROACH VIA CORNELL, HEMLOCK AND TICK, DESCENDING TO 1,500'." When
       handed off to tower crews shall inform the tower of: location; altitude; the type of pattern to be
       flown; to which runway; and if a touch and go then the type of the subsequent approach. Example:
       "RODD 34, 10nms Northeast, at 1,200' MSL, FOR ABEAM TO RUNWAY 15, CLIMBOUT
       FOR ANOTHER TACTICAL APPROACH".
       4.8.4.2. Tactical Departures: When requesting clearance crews shall inform the tower of the tacti-
       cal departure repeating the tactical routing. Example: "Reach 9013 request IFR clearance to
       Dover, Tactical departure via TICK, HEMLOCK". The pilot will receive his normal IFR clear-
       ance from Westover tower. When ready for takeoff the pilot will again inform tower of the tactical
       departure and route. Example "WESTOVER TOWER, REACH 9013, TACTICAL DEPAR-
       TURE, TICK, HEMLOCK, READY FOR TAKEOFF'.
       4.8.4.3. Tactical Local Sorties: On a tactical local the pilot will inform Westover tower (or radar
       controller for subsequent approaches) of the type of pattern to be flown. Example: "RODD 34 will
       be Tactical for runway 23/05". If an IFR pattern is required during a tactical local sortie (or after a
       tactical approach) the radar approach will be requested and the pilot will be properly cleared prior
       to entering IFR conditions. Example: "RODD 34 request radar vectors for ILS 23/05". When
       handed off to tower the pilot will inform the tower of your: location; altitude; the type of pattern to
       be flown; to which runway; and if a touch and go then the type of the subsequent approach. Exam-
       ple: "RODD 34, 10nms Northeast, at 1,200' MSL, FOR ABEAM TO RUNWAY 15, CLIMBOUT
       FOR ANOTHER TACTICAL APPROACH".
   4.8.5. Tactical Operations Within the Westover Class D Airspace. Attachment 7 through Attach-
   ment 12 depict the different profiles for each runway/tactical arrival. Westover Tower personnel shall
   be familiar with each profile.

4.9. Supervisor of Flying (SOF). The SOF shall conduct operations in accordance with 439th Opera-
tions Group Operating Instruction 11-401, Supervisor of Flying and Launch Coordinator. When present
in the Air Traffic Control Tower, the SOF must not perform ATC functions or transmit ATC instructions
or clearances because a person who transmits on an ATC frequency assumes responsibility for separation
of aircraft.

4.10. Runway Selection/Change Procedures.
   4.10.1. The Tower Watch Supervisor/Controller-in-Charge is responsible for selecting the active run-
   way. The Tower will coordinate with Bradley Approach Control and, if necessary, the Supervisor of
   Flying (SOF) prior to changing the runway in use. Tower will advise AMOPS, Bradley TRACON,
   and Weather when the runway change is complete.
30                                                                   439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005


     4.10.2. Runway 23 is designated the primary instrument, calm wind, and alert force runway. This is
     to comply with stringent noise abatement procedures. Runway 23 will normally be used for all flying
     operations at Westover airport when the tailwind component is 10 knots or less.

4.11. Control of Aircraft Ground Traffic.
     4.11.1. Maintain Contact with Ground Control. Aircraft not requiring de-arm after landing will estab-
     lish and maintain contract with ground control after exiting the runway. Aircraft requiring de-arm will
     coordinate with Tower prior to exiting the runway and then contact ground control.
     4.11.2. Preferred Taxi Routes. Taxi from the East Ramp will be accomplished via Taxiways Tango,
     Lima, and Golf. Aircraft parked on the East Ramp will not exit the back side of the East Ramp onto
     Taxiway Golf unless pre-coordinated with Airfield Management (e.g., aircraft parked facing the run-
     way on E-9 for launches during snow events).
     4.11.3. Maintenance Operations. All maintenance engine starts, tows, and taxi operations will be
     coordinated with Airfield Management prior to maintainers contacting the tower. Coordination
     through the 439 AW/CP is acceptable as long as 439 AW/CP contacts Airfield Management. Tower
     will report unauthorized engine starts, tows, and taxi operations to Airfield Management immediately.
     If air piracy is suspected, Tower will immediately initiate a Stop-Alert.

4.12. Clearance of Other than Air Force Aircraft/Civil Aircraft Use of USAF ATCALS.
     4.12.1. Westover Tower may provide service to civil aircraft requesting practice approaches as long
     as it does not interfere with scheduled wing flying operations. Civil aircraft utilizing the facilities at
     Westover Metropolitan Airport shall comply with the standards outlined in the Joint Use Agreement
     and AFPD 10-10, Civil Aircraft Use of United States Air Force Airfields. Other civil aircraft may uti-
     lize Westover airfield for only low approaches unless it conflicts with scheduled wing flying. Civil
     Air Patrol (CAP) aircraft shall be considered military aircraft when using the CAP call sign.
     4.12.2. Civil Aircraft. Civil aircraft using ATC facilities may conduct practice low approaches at
     Westover ARB on a non-interference basis. Low approaches will be at the discretion of the Tower
     Watch Supervisor, depending on the current Force Protection Condition and traffic workload.
     4.12.3. Civil aircraft tenants of Westover Metropolitan airport. Aircraft housed at or transient to
     Westover Metropolitan Airport are governed by the Westover Joint-Use Agreement and will be given
     only full-stop landing clearances. These aircraft will exit the runway and taxi to the FBO terminal via
     the most direct route possible avoiding all military areas of the airport.
     4.12.4. Civil aircraft are cleared in accordance with FAA Regulations, AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft
     Landing Permits, AFI 10-1002, Agreements for Civil Aircraft Use of Air Force Airfields, and the
     Westover Joint-Use Agreement.
     4.12.5. Operating Owned or Leased Aircraft. AFI 10-1001 and AFI 10-1002 establish procedures for
     government personnel, operating their own or leased aircraft, to use Air Force airfields. Airfield Man-
     agement will maintain and disseminated the current list of owned or leased aircraft authorized to land
     or conduct practice approaches at Westover ARB.
     4.12.6. Aircraft Landing without Permission. When civil aircraft land without permission, Tower will
     immediately initiate a Stop-Alert.
439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005                                                                               31


   4.12.7. Unscheduled Military Aircraft Arrivals. Tower will query AMOPS regarding the acceptabil-
   ity of all military aircraft arriving at Westover without a flight plan (FPNO).

4.13. LMR Select Call Feature (Private Line). The base LMR system does not have an electronic or
mechanical select call feature that allows air traffic controllers to ‘mute’ the FM Nets in the tower to elim-
inate transmissions not directed to the tower, therefore transmissions on the Ramp/Tower Net are limited
procedurally. Only agencies requiring contact with the Tower or Airfield Management are authorized to
transmit on the Ramp/Tower Net.
   4.13.1. The following agencies operate routinely on the Ramp/Tower Net:
       4.13.1.1. Tower.
       4.13.1.2. Airfield Management.
       4.13.1.3. Transient Alert.
       4.13.1.4. Civil Engineering.
       4.13.1.5. Fire Department.
       4.13.1.6. Security Forces.
   4.13.2. The Tower has the capability to monitor and transmit on the Fire Department and Security
   Forces Nets if necessary.

4.14. Interruptions to Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS).
   4.14.1. Scheduling Interruptions to ATCALS. Preventive maintenance of ATCALS performed during
   other than published maintenance periods must be coordinated with the Airfield Operations Manager,
   who will perform required coordination with USAF and FAA air traffic control and affected base
   agencies. The identification feature of ATCALS released to maintenance will be turned off when nec-
   essary in accordance with AFI 13-203/AFRC Supplement 1. The following table is the official
   NO-NOTAM Preventive Maintenance Schedule including required weather conditions.
   4.14.2. NO-NOTAM Preventive Maintenance Schedule:

4.15. Dual Operation of Instrument Landing System (ILS). The remote status indicator (RSI) in the
Tower is equipped with an interlock mechanism that cannot be disabled in the tower. Since the ILS com-
ponents for Runways 05 and 23 operate on the same frequency, at no time shall both systems operate
simultaneously. The following are exceptions to this rule: After coordination with the AOM, maintenance
personnel may bypass the ILS interlock to allow simultaneous Localizer and/or Glideslope operations to
accommodate facility installation, maintenance restoration, preventive maintenance, or flight inspection
as long as both facilities are taken off the air. The AOM shall inform the tower and AMOPS of the
planned operation and ensure NOTAMs are sent if applicable. Maintenance personnel will ensure at least
a 3,000 foot ceiling and/or 5 miles visibility exists prior to requesting dual mode operation. Maintenance
will notify the AOM when the system is returned to normal operational status.

4.16. Radar Service/IFR Operations.
     4.16.1. Normal IFR Procedures. Maximum use of the IFR system will be utilized on all flights. Air-
     craft departing IFR from Westover airport will normally receive a radar departure with Bradley
     Approach/Departure.
     4.16.2. Runway 05 Operations.
        4.16.2.1. Initial departure clearance for Runway 05. Tower controllers shall issue the following
        IFR clearance for Runway 05 departures: “(Aircraft Callsign) Cleared (Clearance and/or amend-
        ment, as applicable), on departure maintain 3000, expect (filed altitude) 10 minutes after depar-
        ture, departure frequency will be 125.35 or 325.8, squawk (assigned code).” NOTE: Pilots should
        expect additional departure instructions (initial turns or change to initial altitude) after an IFR
        release is obtained from Bradley TRACON and prior to takeoff clearance.
        4.16.2.2. IFR releases for Runway 05 are valid for 3 minutes.
        4.16.2.3. Standard Climbout for Runway 05. Aircrew can expect to fly and air traffic control shall
        issue: “(Aircraft Callsign) After completing (touch-and-go, low approach, stop-and-go), fly run-
        way heading, climb and maintain 3000”.
     4.16.3. Runway 23 Operations.
        4.16.3.1. Initial departure clearance for Runway 23. Tower controllers shall issue the following
        IFR clearance for Runway 23 departures: “(Aircraft Callsign) Cleared (Clearance and/or amend-
        ment, as applicable), on departure maintain 3000, expect (filed altitude) 10 minutes after depar-
        ture, departure frequency will be 125.35 or 325.8, squawk (assigned code).” NOTE: Pilots should
        expect additional departure instructions (initial turns or change to initial altitude) after an IFR
        release is obtained from Bradley TRACON and prior to takeoff clearance.
        4.16.3.2. IFR releases for Runway 23 are valid for 3 minutes.
        4.16.3.3. Standard Climbout for Runway 23. Aircrew can expect to fly and air traffic control shall
        issue: “(Aircraft Callsign) After completing (touch-and-go, low approach, stop-and-go), fly run-
        way heading, leaving 1200 turn right heading 360, climb and maintain 3000”.
     4.16.4. Radar Approaches: Multiple touch and go, stop and go, and low approaches may be accom-
     plished at the discretion of Bradley TRACON and Westover Tower based upon work load and traffic/
     weather conditions. Pilots shall inform tower on initial contact of intentions to return to the radar pat-
     tern to give the controllers enough time to coordinate with Bradley Approach.
439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005                                                                               33


   4.16.5. Protection of the 360 Overhead Pattern. Anytime aircraft are in the overhead pattern, tower
   shall restrict departures to 1500 feet MSL until departure end of runway.
   4.16.6. Unless multiple approaches have been previously coordinated, an instrument approach nor-
   mally terminates in a full-stop landing or a low approach followed by entry into VFR pattern.
   4.16.7. The Westover radar traffic pattern is controlled by Bradley Approach and falls outside the
   confines of the Bradley Class C airspace. The pattern is bi-directional and is defined as a rectangular
   pattern with the downwind leg approximately 4 NM west of the runway centerline. The normal down-
   wind headings are 050º for Runway 23 and 230º for Runway 05 (See Attachment 18, Radar Pattern
   Diagrams).
   4.16.8. Circling Approaches. On initial contact with Bradley Approach, pilots shall request “CIR-
   CLING APPROACH STAY WITH TOWER/BACK TO RADAR”. Pilots may initiate an approach to
   any runway, but shall only circle to Runways 23, 33, or 15. Practice training circling approach mini-
   mums are 1,200 feet MSL.
       4.16.8.1. For approaches to Runway 23:
           4.16.8.1.1. Circling to Runway 23: Initiate circling maneuver at the approach end of Runway
           23 and circle northeast for a left base to Runway 23.
           4.16.8.1.2. Circling to Runway 33: Initiate circling maneuver at 3 DME with a left break for a
           right base to Runway 33. Circling approaches to Runway 33 are approved northeast of the
           base only.
           4.16.8.1.3. Circling to Runway 15: Initiate circling maneuver at 3 DME with a right break for
           a left base to Runway 15. Circling approaches to Runway 15 are approved northeast of the
           base only.
       4.16.8.2. For approaches to Runway 05:
           4.16.8.2.1. Circling to Runway 23: Initiate circling maneuver at the intersection of the run-
           ways and circle northeast for a left base to Runway 23.
           4.16.8.2.2. Circling to Runway 33: Pilots shall fly down Runway 05 and initiate circling
           maneuver prior to 3 DME northeast of the base making a right break for a right base to Run-
           way 33.
           4.16.8.2.3. Circling to Runway 15: Pilots shall fly down Runway 05 and initiate circling
           maneuver prior to 3 DME northeast of the base making a left break for a left base to Runway
           15.

4.17. Landing Lights. Landing lights will be displayed by all aircraft making approaches and/or land-
ings at Westover with the exception of wingmen on night formation low approaches.

4.18. Controlled Departure Times. Aircraft requesting a controlled departure time will identify the
controlled departure time in the remarks section of their flight plan and advise ground control prior to taxi.
Fighter aircraft shall inform ground control 5 minutes prior to exiting the arming areas.

4.19. Noise Abatement. To minimize the impact of aircraft noise on the local community, the most strin-
gent noise abatement procedures, compatible with safety, will be employed.
34                                                                  439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005


     4.19.1. Afterburner equipped aircraft will terminate use of afterburners as soon as practical after
     departure.
     4.19.2. Intersection/formation departures will not be permitted if aircraft cannot reach 1000 feet MSL
     prior to the airfield boundary.

4.20. Standard Go-Around Procedures.
     4.20.1. Under Visual Flight Rules, aircraft will offset from the runway as directed by ATC to avoid
     overflying the runway.
     4.20.2. Under Instrument Flight Rules, aircraft shall execute published missed approach procedures
     (DoD Approach Plates) unless directed otherwise by air traffic control.
     4.20.3. Controllers shall state the reason for the go-around (i.e., vehicle/personnel on runway) as soon
     as possible after the instruction is issued.

4.21. Protection from Ground Jet Blast.
     4.21.1. Pilots or aircraft maintenance personnel are required to advise the Tower prior to commencing
     any engine run to ensure arriving/departing/other taxiing aircraft are not affected.
     4.21.2. Engine runs on the taxiways are not authorized if any arriving, departing, or taxiing aircraft is
     less than 1000 feet behind the aircraft conducting the engine run. Pilots or aircraft maintenance per-
     sonnel are responsible for ensuring adequate clearance from other aircraft while conducting engine
     run operations on the ramp or in parking areas. Only idle power engine runs on parking spots E-7 and
     E-8 are authorized.
     4.21.3. After coordinating with Base Operations, aircraft maintenance personnel shall contact the
     tower to request an engine run using the following phraseology: “Westover Ground, (Aircraft Tail
     Number), request engine run on (Parking Location)”. Maintenance personnel shall inform the tower
     of the type of engine run, including the number of engines to run and whether it will be an idle or full
     power run. Maintenance personnel must remain in constant radio communication with the tower dur-
     ing the course of the engine run.
     4.21.4. During idle power engine runs on parking spots E-1 through E-8, tower shall use the follow-
     ing criteria for permissible operations:
        4.21.4.1. Operations on Runway 05/23 are authorized for all aircraft.
        4.21.4.2. Taxi operations on Taxiway G are authorized for all aircraft.
     4.21.5. During above idle engine runs on parking spots E-1 through E-6, tower shall use the following
     criteria for permissible operations:
        4.21.5.1. Operations on Runway 05/23 are only authorized for weight class large or greater air-
        craft.
        4.21.5.2. Engine running aircraft must be brought back to idle for weight class small or small plus
        aircraft operations on Runway 05/23 or for any aircraft operation of Taxiway G.
     4.21.6. During idle power engine runs on parking spots E-9 through E-14, tower shall use the follow-
     ing criteria for permissible operations:
        4.21.6.1. Operations on Runway 05/23 are authorized for all aircraft.
439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005                                                                              35


       4.21.6.2. Taxi operations on Taxiway G are only authorized for weight class large or greater air-
       craft.
   4.21.7. During above idle engine runs on parking spots E-9 through E-14, tower shall use the follow-
   ing criteria for permissible operations: No aircraft operations are permitted on Runway 05/23 or Taxi-
   way G unless the engine running aircraft is brought back to idle. Once idle power is confirmed with
   maintenance, the provision of paragraph 4.21.6. apply.

4.22. Continuity of Air Traffic Services/Air Traffic Control Facility Evacuation.
   4.22.1. The 439 OG/CC has determined that alternate air traffic control facilities are not required.
   4.22.2. In the event Tower personnel evacuate the facility, the airport will be closed. Aircraft flight
   operations are restricted and aircraft shall divert. Evacuating controllers will rally at Airfield Manage-
   ment Operations IAW Tower Operating Instruction 13-1, General.
   4.22.3. The Tower can withstand winds up to 100 knots or 115 miles per hour. Tower personnel will
   evacuate when winds reach 70 knots (steady or gusting).
   4.22.4. Auxiliary Power Requirements. All Air Traffic Control and Meteorological and Navigational
   Aid facilities will be equipped with auxiliary power sources complete with automatic start capability.
   These facilities must meet or exceed the requirements in FAA Order 6950.2, Electrical Power Policy
   Implementation at National Airspace System Facilities.

4.23. Runway 05 and Runway 33 Departure Phraseology. IAW FAAO 7110.65, para 4-3-2 c. 2. and c. 3.
NOTE: controllers shall issue the following additional instructions for IFR aircraft departing Runway 05
or Runway 33:
   4.23.1. Runway 05 Departures: Minimum climb of 250 feet per NM to 900 MSL
   4.23.2. Runway 33 Departures: Minimum climb of 320 feet per NM to 1400 MSL
   4.23.3. Example Phraseology:
       4.23.3.1. If Runway 05 is in use: “N12345 cleared to (Airport Name) airport as filed, on departure
       maintain at least 250 foot per nautical mile climb gradient until 900, climb and maintain 3000,
       expect (enroute altitude) 10 minutes after departure, departure frequency (freq), squawk (assigned
       beacon code)”
       4.23.3.2. If Runway 33 is in use: “N12345 cleared to (Airport Name) airport as filed, on departure
       maintain at least 320 foot per nautical mile climb gradient until 1400, climb and maintain 3000,
       expect (enroute altitude) 10 minutes after departure, departure frequency (freq), squawk (assigned
       beacon code)”
   4.23.4. These instructions will be issued until pictorial ATC departure procedures are published for
   Runways 05 and 33.
36                                                                    439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005


                                                  Chapter 5

                 SPECIAL OPERATIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Dropped Objects. Aircrew suspecting an object was dropped from their aircraft shall report the
event immediately to Air Traffic Control and CASINO at DSN 589-3571 or 252.1 MHz. Command Post
shall confirm information with the tower and airfield management operations.

5.2. Drag Chutes. Drag chutes will normally be retained with aircraft until parked. AMOPS or transient
alert will recover chutes inadvertently jettisoned on the airfield. In all instances, tower will advise the
recovering agency of the location of the chute and its impact to operations and the recovery agency will
notify tower when jettisoned chutes have been removed from the active surfaces.

5.3. Aircraft Security/Stop Alert Procedures. In conjunction with the procedures contained in AFI
13-207, Preventing and Resisting Air Piracy (FOUO), Stop Alert procedures are designed to prevent and
stop unauthorized engine start, taxi, takeoff, and landing at Westover ARB. The Tower will maintain sur-
veillance of all taxiing aircraft and aircraft tows. Tower will attempt to establish radio/light gun contact
with any suspect aircraft and issue appropriate instructions. If unable to contact the aircraft or if instruc-
tions are ignored, the tower will declare a “Stop Alert” using the following procedures:
     5.3.1. Westover Tower shall:
        5.3.1.1. Activate the primary crash alarm system (crash phone) indicating the words “Stop Alert,”
        the aircraft type, position, direction of movement, and any other pertinent information.
        5.3.1.2. Direct all taxiing aircraft to hold their present position until the stop alert is terminated or
        they are otherwise directed.
     5.3.2. Security Forces Control Center shall:

       5.3.4.2. Respond to the scene (CAM or designated representative) as necessary.
       5.3.4.3. Notify the AOM immediately and prepare all appropriate paperwork, including DD Form
       2402, Civil Aircraft Hold Harmless Agreement, and any applicable payment voucher.

5.4. Fire Protection Support to Flying Operations.
   5.4.1. Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting Index (Capability). Westover ARB normally meets the crite-
   ria for ARFF Index E. When crash or rescue capability, as determined by the fire department, falls
   below levels required to sustain specific types of aircraft operations, the Westover Fire Department
   will immediately notify Airfield Management via hotline.
   5.4.2. Curtailment of Operations. During periods of reduced ARFF capability, the Fire Department,
   using their guidelines, shall determine which activities, if any, will be curtailed and immediately brief
   AMOPS. AMOPS will brief the AOM who will brief the 439 OG/CC. Airfield Management will
   notify all other concerned agencies and send NOTAMS as required.
   5.4.3. Resuming Normal Operations. As crash or rescue capabilities are upgraded, Fire Department
   will immediately notify Airfield Management. AMOPS shall ensure all agencies are notified and can-
   cel NOTAMS as required.

5.5. Quiet Hours. In addition to quiet hours published in the US IFR Supplement, the following proce-
dures apply:
   5.5.1. All requests for quiet hours will be forwarded to 439 OSS/OSA not later than three weeks prior
   to the event. 439 OSS/OSA shall coordinate with the 439 OG/CC and will pass approval information
   to AMOPS, command post, scheduling, and tower. AMOPS will prepare and disseminate airfield
   advisories as appropriate.
   5.5.2. Operations Procedures. Actual quiet hour times will be passed by airfield operations to 439
   AW/CP and tower, who will post them on their operations boards. When required, the schedule will
   reflect a 15-minute "pad" for planned takeoffs and landings before and after the quiet period in order
   to accommodate unavoidable delays. However, ground operations may continue until 2 minutes prior
   to the actual quiet period. The tower will make two blanket broadcasts on tower and ground control
   frequencies at least 10 minutes prior to and at the beginning of quiet hours using the following phrase-
   ology: "Quiet hours commence in XX minutes/are in effect at this time."
   5.5.3. Time period and restrictions may vary depending on the type and location of the event requir-
   ing quiet hours. Units should check the daily advisory sheet published by Airfield Management Oper-
   ations.

5.6. Aircraft Turns on Runway. To preclude abrasions and deterioration of the surface, single tandem
wheeled (C-130) or larger aircraft will not be allowed to make 180° turns on the asphalt portions of the
runway.

5.7. Weather Information/Severe Weather Procedures.
   5.7.1. Weather observations shall be transmitted via the N-TFS system to 439 AW/CP, Tower, and
   Airfield Management Operations at least hourly.

     5.7.2. Pilot Weather Reports (PIREP). Westover Air Traffic Control personnel will relay to the Base
     Weather observer all PIREPs received from aircrew. Pilots may report PIREPs directly to METRO/
     PMSV (274.75 MHz). Base Weather shall ensure tower is informed of PIREPs transmitted via
     METRO/PMSV (this may be done via automated means).
     5.7.3. Hazardous/Severe Weather Notification. When weather watches and warnings for the follow-
     ing events are issued by the 15 OWS (Weather Hub), Westover Weather Team personnel shall notify
     AMOPS, Tower, Command Post, and the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC):
        5.7.3.1. Weather Watches:

     ing for lightning within five miles of the airfield, the following procedures apply:
        5.7.4.1. All personnel, including civilians, contractors, and transient/deployed personnel, must
        seek shelter in a vehicle, aircraft, or structure immediately after notification until the lightning
        warning has expired.
439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005                                                                              39


       5.7.4.2. Arriving aircraft shall be allowed to land, but the crew and passengers must remain on
       board the aircraft until the lightning warning has expired. Crews should not expect any ground
       support during the warning period.
       5.7.4.3. Departing aircraft, given that the crew is already on board and no further ground support
       is required, shall be allowed to taxi and depart at their discretion.
       5.7.4.4. All agencies in receipt of the warning shall relay the warning to personnel operating on
       the aerodrome to the maximum extent possible.

craft incidents, accidents, or operations to unauthorized agencies (in accordance with AFI 13-203/AFRC
Supplement 1 and AFI 13-213/AFRC Supplement 1). Personnel requesting information shall be referred
to 439 AW/PA during normal duty hours and to 439 AW/CP after duty hours.

5.10. Midair Collision Avoidance (MACA) (See AFI 91-202, paragraph 7.10).
   5.10.1. 439 AW/SE is the primary OPR for MACA. Airfield Operations provides support for this pro-
   gram whenever possible.
   5.10.2. Due to the complexity and volume of civil, general aviation, military air traffic, and paradrop
   operations in the Pioneer Valley area, it is imperative that all operators be aware of the flight patterns
   of aircraft operating at or around Westover ARB.

5.11. Airfield Facilities/Equipment and Aerodrome Surface Maintenance.
   5.11.1. Any maintenance performed on facilities or equipment which affects air traffic control shall
   be coordinated with the Air Traffic Manager (439 OSS/OSAT).
   5.11.2. Any maintenance on other facilities or equipment, or aerodrome surfaces (i.e., repair, resur-
   facing, painting, etc.) shall be coordinated with 439 OSS/OSAA .

5.12. Paradrop Operations.
   5.12.1. The Beanbag DZ is located on the Westover airport northwest of the runway intersection.
   5.12.2. Jump agencies shall ensure 439 OSS/OSAA has current Drop Zone surveys on file.
40                                                                 439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005


     5.12.3. Scheduling of paradrop operations shall be accomplished with Westover Airfield Manage-
     ment Operations via the normal PPR process. Scheduling must be accomplished not later than
     72-hours in advance of the operation.
     5.12.4. Aircraft operations may be conducted simultaneously with paradrop operations as long as
     FAAO 7110.65 separation standards are applied.
     5.12.5. DZ Safety Officers (DZSO) shall ensure that the point of impact (PI) is placed in a location on
     the DZ that minimizes impact to aircraft and personnel operations
     5.12.6. Vehicle operations in active Drop Zones shall be conducted in accordance with paragraph 3.9.

plemental to that plan and specific to Air Traffic or aerodrome operations.

6.2. Aerodrome Closure/Suspension of Runway Operations.
   6.2.1. Airfield Management Operations is the primary authority for closure and reopening of the aero-
   drome and suspension/resumption of runway operations as it relates to the condition of the airfield.
   6.2.2. The Tower Watch Supervisor can suspend runway operations when there is a reason to believe
   that a hazard exists on or near the runway or in the immediate approach area. Once runway operations
   are suspended, only the tower watch supervisor, after consultation with airfield management, may
   resume runway operations.

6.3. Activation of the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS).
   6.3.1. The PCAS will be activated by the Tower for all aircraft emergencies, airfield accidents, or for

   document.
   6.5.4. Response vehicles shall be positioned in an area that will not impede aircraft movement.
   6.5.5. Procedures for designation and responsibilities of the On-Scene Commander (OSC) are defined
   in 439 AW FSTR Plan 10-2.

6.6. Responsibilities During Emergencies.
   6.6.1. Aircraft Commander (AC):
      6.6.1.1. The AC will declare an emergency with the controlling agency (Bradley Approach/
      Westover Tower) as soon as practical.
      6.6.1.2. The AC will inform the controlling agency of emergency termination as soon as practical
      during airborne phases of flight.
      6.6.1.3. The Fire Chief is the only agency authorized to terminate an emergency on the ground.
      6.6.1.4. Due to the fact that Fire Chief vehicles are only equipped with VHF radios, UHF only air-
      craft will maintain contact with Tower throughout the emergency. Tower will relay information
      between the aircraft and the fire chief.
   6.6.2. The Tower shall:
      6.6.2.1. When advised of an emergency, activate the PCAS and broadcast on all available ATC
      frequencies that an emergency is in progress. The broadcast shall include any anticipated runway
      closure time.
      6.6.2.2. When an emergency aircraft enters the Class D airspace, this aircraft become number one
      for landing. All other aircraft will be given instructions so they will not impede the recovery of the
      emergency aircraft or the emergency response vehicles or personnel.
      6.6.2.3. Relinquish control of the runway to the Fire Chief as required or as requested by the Fire
      Chief.
      6.6.2.4. Suspend runway operations when the emergency aircraft lands until the emergency air-
      craft and response vehicles/personnel have exited the runway and airfield management has com-
      pleted a FOD check.
44                                                                 439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005


        6.6.2.5. Monitor the emergency frequency.
        6.6.2.6. Broadcast on all available frequencies that the emergency has terminated and the airfield
        has returned to normal operations.
     6.6.3. Airfield Management shall:
        6.6.3.1. Respond to all emergencies on the aerodrome.
        6.6.3.2. Perform a FOD check after any emergency aircraft lands and after termination of a
        Ground Emergency.
        6.6.3.3. If the runway/aerodrome is closed for a prolonged period of time, transmit a NOTAM
        after coordination with the OG/CC via the AOM.
     6.6.4. The Base Fire Chief will:
        6.6.4.1. Act as the initial on-scene commander until arrival of primary (or appointed alternate)
        on-scene commander. Upon taking control of the situation, the on-scene commander (if other than
        the fire chief) will advise the Tower.
        6.6.4.2. During emergency operations, position fire apparatus at designated locations.
        6.6.4.3. Maintain fire protection responsibility for the crashed or distressed aircraft and release
        the aircraft to the on-scene commander when appropriate.
        6.6.4.4. Keep all fire fighting apparatus not required to support the distressed aircraft positioned
        as to not impede aircraft movement.
     6.6.5. EOD personnel will:
        6.6.5.1. Respond to aircraft emergencies/accidents as directed by the on-scene commander. In the
        event EOD personnel are not readily available due to higher priority requirements, the on-scene
        commander will take action to obtain personnel to perform de-arm operations.
        6.6.5.2. De-arm/remove hazardous explosive items before the aircraft is released to the investiga-
        tion team or removed from the runway.
     6.6.6. The Crash Recovery Crew will respond to the runway to expeditiously remove disabled aircraft
     at the direction of the on-scene commander.

6.7. Emergency Bailout/External Stores Jettison Procedures.
     6.7.1. If emergency bailout/external stores jettison is required, aircrew should ensure stores and/or
     aircraft impact in an uninhabited area.
     6.7.2. When stores are jettisoned, the pilot will report the location of the stores to CASINO, who will
     pass this information to all applicable agencies.

6.8. Controlled Bailout Procedures. Time permitting, aircrew planning a controlled bailout shall con-
tact the 439 AW/CP (CASINO, 252.1). The primary bailout area is heading 040° from Westover between
15 and 30 DME. Air traffic controllers shall, to the best of their ability using visual references and the
TDW, determine the location of the downed aircraft, plot those coordinates on the crash grid map or suit-
able chart, and relay the information via the PCN.
439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005                                                                              45


6.9. Controlled External Stores/Cargo Jettison Procedures. The primary external stores jettison area
is Beanbag Drop Zone (an area approximately 5000’ x 900’ adjacent to Runway 15/33). This area will
only be used in VMC conditions. If weather precludes jettison of external stores in visual conditions,
pilots will contact Bradley Approach Control on 325.8 for alternate instructions.

6.10. Fuel Dump Procedures. 439 AW aircrew will use the phrase “adjusting gross weight” to indicate
the need for fuel dumping after obtaining 439 OG/CC permission.
   6.10.1. After obtaining permission, the aircraft will proceed to the PSM 140/14 and establish them-
   selves in a holding pattern. Fuel should be jettisoned above FL200 and the crew will record time, posi-
   tion, winds, and outside air temperature at the time of jettison.
   6.10.2. Should an emergency preclude the use of the above procedure, aircrews must use good judg-
   ment and record the time, position, and amount of fuel jettisoned and report the information to the
   wing safety office after landing.

6.11. Hot Brake Procedures. A hot brake condition is a suspect, potential, or actual hazardous situation,
attributed to overheating of the wheel brake systems.
   6.11.1. A hot brake condition will be treated as an aircraft ground emergency and the PCAS will be
   activated.
   6.11.2. Aircrew or ground personnel will immediately notify tower/ground control of a hot brake
   condition providing call sign, location, and aircraft tail number. The aircrew will taxi the aircraft as
   instructed to the designated areas at either end of the runway or clear to the side of the taxi route (See
   Attachment 2). Engines will not be shut down until fire fighting equipment is in place.
   6.11.3. When a hot brake condition is verified, all nonessential personnel will evacuate the area
   within 300 feet of the aircraft.

6.12. F-16 EPU/Hydrazine Procedures. The F-16 EPU uses a highly toxic fuel called hydrazine
(H-70). If the EPU is activated, a check must be made to ensure there is no hydrazine leak.
   6.12.1. When the EPU is used or a hydrazine leak is suspected, the aircraft must be isolated until a
   safety check can be made to determine if there has been an actual leak.
   6.12.2. The designated hydrazine inspection area is collocated with the primary hot brake area at
   either end of the runway (see Attachment 2). If it is not feasible to taxi the aircraft to the hydrazine
   inspection area, the air crew will attempt to clear the runway and main taxi routes.
   6.12.3. The air crew or ground personnel will immediately notify the Tower/ground control of an
   EPU activation and/or a hydrazine leak. The tower will activate the PCAS.

6.13. Emergency Landing of Civil Aircraft at Westover ARB. Civil aircraft making an emergency
landing at Westover ARB will be processed in accordance with AFIs 10-1001 and 10-1002. The aircraft

        ous (HOT) cargo area.

6.15. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Procedures.
     6.15.1. The reception of an ELT signal by the Tower or any agency will be treated as a possible air-
     craft accident/pilot ejection and will be handled accordingly except the tower will not activate the
     PCAS.
NOTE: ELT signals received during the first five minutes of the hour and lasting no more than three
audio sweeps will be considered tests and no action is required.
     6.15.2. When an ELT signal is received or reported, the Tower will immediately notify Airfield Man-
     agement Operations.
439AWI13-201 1 DECEMBER 2005                                                                           47


   6.15.3. Airfield Management Operations will take action to locate and determine the source of the
   ELT signal, and will advise the Tower of any results.

6.16. Rescue Protection for Aeromedical Airlift Aircraft. Tower will notify Airfield Management
Operations of any inbound medevac aircraft requesting to land on the installation with the exception of
aircraft landing at Westover Metropolitan Airport. Airfield Management Operations is designated as the
single base agency for relaying information on arriving/departing aeromedical aircraft. Airfield Manage-
ment Operations will disperse applicable information to the following base agencies:
   6.16.1. Fire Department.
   6.16.2. Security Forces.
   6.16.3. Transient Alert.

6.17. Hot Gun/Hung Ordinance. Pad 23 is designated as the Hot Gun/Hung Ordnance clearing area.
All aircraft with forward firing ordnance will be parked on the North Ramp with the nose of the aircraft
on a heading of 050°. Aircraft arriving with a hot gun or hung ordnance will notify both Bradley
Approach Control and Westover Tower as soon as possible and follow the following procedures:
   6.17.1. Landing Runway 05:
       6.17.1.1. Upon landing, the aircraft will continue on the runway to Pad 23.
       6.17.1.2. When parking, the aircraft will establish a heading of 050° before engine shutdown.
       6.17.1.3. Hung ordinance removal and gun clearing will be performed in accordance with estab-
       lished procedures.
   6.17.2. Landing Runway 23:
       6.17.2.1. Upon landing, the aircraft will execute a 180° turn to the left and taxi down the runway
       to Pad 23.
       6.17.2.2. When parking, the aircraft will establish a heading of 050° before engine shutdown.
       6.17.2.3. Hung ordinance removal and gun clearing will be performed in accordance with estab-
       lished procedures.

6.18. Evacuation of Airfield Management Operations Facilities. The alternate AMOPS facility will
be the Air Traffic Control Tower. All mission systems (including the Pilot-to-Dispatch frequency and Pri-
mary Crash Alarm System) are available at the Tower except for the Secondary Crash Net. AMOPS per-
sonnel will relay SCN information to the Command Post via hotline and Command Post will activate the
SCN from their location. If the Tower is also evacuated (see paragraph 4.22.), the airport will be closed,
therefore no additional alternate facilities are required for AMOPS.

6.19. Aircraft Lost Communications Procedures. If communication is lost with the air traffic control
agency, aircrew will squawk NORDO (7600). ATC facilities shall apply the procedures detailed in FAA
Order 7110.65, Chapter 10 and any applicable Air Force Instruction.

     ILS PRECISION APPROACH CRITICAL AREAS




                             Localizer Critical Area. This rectangular
                             area extends from the localizer transmitting
                             antenna 2,000 feet toward the approach end
                             of the runway and 150 feet on each side of the
                             runway centerline. It includes a 50-feet
                             extension behind the localizer antenna.




                             Glide Slope Critical Area. This is a
                             fan-shaped area that extends from the
                             glideslope antenna 1,300 feet toward the
                             approach end of the runway or to the end of
                             the runway, whichever is greater. It covers an
                             area 30 degrees each side of a line drawn
                             through the glideslope antenna and parallel to
                             the runway centerline.
