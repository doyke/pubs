    ported operations which can be resolved by cash reimbursement, service, or replacement in kind.
    30.2. Examples of Customer Complaints:
       30.2.1. Sales or service claims by customers, such as breach of warranty, defective service and
       shortages.

       sonal injury or for property damage to other than the article involved.
    30.5. Legal Involvement. Legal involvement does not change a customer complaint into a liability
    claim.

31. Federal Tort Claim Act (FTCA). NAFIs are instrumentalities of the Federal Government and enjoy
its privileges and immunities. A tort committed by a NAF employee, acting within the scope of his or her
employment or duties, may give rise to NAF liability under the FTCA.
    31.1. Do not use appropriated funds to pay an award, compromise, or judgment of a claim for which
    a NAFI is liable.

32. Commercial Insurance. If a special liability risk arises, such as the purchase of "rain-out/cancella-
tion" insurance for a special one-time event, the SV Commander, Director, or Deputy must contact HQ
AFSVA/SVXC and request approval to purchase commercial insurance.
    32.1. Broad Coverage. Because of the broad coverage of the NAF Liability Program, NAFIs must
    not purchase commercial public liability insurance except when it is required by a Status-of-Forces
    Agreement or other country-to-country agreement.

are expected to pay for these losses using local APFs. If the installation commander determines that such
APFs are not available to cover the losses, the installation should request APFs from the MAJCOM.
