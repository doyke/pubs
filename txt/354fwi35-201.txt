Affairs will document complaints and forward them to the 353 Combat Training Squadron Current Oper-
ations office (353 CTS/DOO). 353 CTS/DOO will research the noise complaint and provide PA with a
proposed answer within 24 hours of the complaint. PA will then provide information to the caller and for-
ward completed form to Alaska Command Public Affairs (ALCOM/PA), 11th Air Force Operations Sup-

1. Responsibilities:
   1.1. 354 FW Public Affairs:
       1.1.1. Document and initiate the review process of all noise/low-level-flying complaints from
       civilians pertaining to reported aircraft noise complaints or sonic booms.
       1.1.2. Complete entire 11 AF Noise Complaint worksheet so complaint can be investigated.
       Ensure all questions on the noise complaint worksheet are answered to the best of the caller’s abil-
       ity. Ask callers to provide ground references and/or coordinates if possible. Nuisance complaints
       without adequate information will be handled accordingly by the chief of PA.
       1.1.3. Be responsive and professional to all callers. Record the complaint, even if the aircraft
       involved are not from Eielson. Keep the complaint at the local level if possible.
           1.1.3.1. Do not refer to another office, base, or command. Tell them the incident will be inves-
           tigated and they will get a personal response back within two business days.

       include the complaint record number (i.e. EI-02-05-10-01 -- Eielson, year, month, date, number of
       complaints that day) and the caller’s last name
       1.1.6. Evaluate all responses to determine the need for commander involvement.
       1.1.7. Provide caller with an official response NLT two business days after the complaint is taken
       (unless complaint is taken after duty hours or on a weekend). Complaints not resolved within the

       forwarded to a flying squadron without detailed information, location and time (i.e., latitude/lon-
       gitude). If complaint is during a Cope Thunder exercise, thoroughly investigate all complaints
       received involving unit aircraft, to include immediate review of flight tapes, and interviewing of
       flight leads and other flight members. All attempts will be made to determine the reason for the
       alleged infraction within the prescribed time limit.
       1.2.2. Attempt to answer the noise complaint before involving the flying units.
       1.2.3. Forward the 11 AF Noise Complaint worksheet to the applicable squadron director of oper-

       gation/coordination.
