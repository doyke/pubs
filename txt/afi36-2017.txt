   Standards, to take part in any pay or point-gaining activity.

and coordination with the primary unit.

                      TRAINING AND ORIENTATION REQUIREMENTS


7.1. ALO Orientation. New ALOs must attend a 5-day initial ALO orientation tour at USAFA as soon
as possible after initial assignment. USAFA/RRP schedules required refresher training, every 5 years
after initial orientation. New ALOs must attend a 1-day active duty tour at a host AFROTC detachment
as soon as possible after assignment and every once every 3 years thereafter. All ALOs should periodi-
cally attend an AFROTC training encampment orientation. ALOs should forward requests for USAFA
training tours through the LOC to USAFA/RRPR. The USAFA Reserve Personnel Division prepares or
coordinates administrative orders and TDY requests.

7.2. Annual Training Exceptions. ALOs assigned to 9001st ARS will not perform annual training
(AT). Primary duty units will establish AT requirements for ALOs assigned to other USAFR or ANG
units. On occasion, ALOs may perform their AT at USAFA, if authorized by their command or assign-
ment. (See AFI 36-8001 concerning waiver for AT.)

7.3. Professional Military Education. ALO personnel assigned as primary duty reservists with the
9001st ARS may not attend Professional Military Education (PME) in residence, but may attend National
Security Seminars in a nonpay status for points only, if quotas allow.

                                         COMMUNICATIONS


8.1. General. LOCs must annually contact congressional members and staff to maintain communications
liaison. Each LOC should offer ALO support or assistance; i.e., congressional selections panels, brief-
ings, and other related USAFA and AFROTC recruiting and screening activities. ALOs may communi-
cate by personal visit, telephone, or written correspondence, but must not solicit nominations, committee
interview ratings, rankings or selection results. ALOs who have contact with a Member of Congress must
notify the Academy concerning the date and substance of the contact. A congressional contact form is
available for such purposes.

8.2. Communication with Admissions Staff. ALOs may coordinate directly with the appropriate
USAFA admissions staff regarding USAFA applicant problems and status. They should direct ALO Pro-
gram administration and management inquiries to the respective USAFA/RRPR.

8.3. Communication with Cadets and their Commanders. ALOs should correspond directly with
USAFA or AFROTC Cadets and their USAFA Air Officers Commanding (AOC) or AFROTC Comman-
dant of Cadets to offer encouragement, maintain support, and monitor progress if they recruited and
assisted them in obtaining USAFA appointments or enrolling in AFROTC. ALOs and USAFA AOCs or
AFROTC detachment staff may mutually communicate with one another to maintain support of their
respective cadets.

8.4. Communication with Senior Staff. ALOs communicate with the USAFA Superintendent, Dean of
Faculty, Commandant of Cadets, Director of Athletics, AFROTC Commandant, or AFROTC Vice Com-
mandant through the USAFA or AFROTC chain of command.

8.5. Communication with Primary Duty Unit. USAFR and ANG ALOs must coordinate and commu-
nicate directly with their primary duty units on personnel, administration, career, and other unit matters.

8.6. Communication with USAFRS Personnel. LOCs, DLOCs, and ALOs normally communicate
with USAFRS personnel through the USAFRS chain of command. Depending on the nature of the com-
munication, ALO personnel at any level may directly address any echelon within USAFRS. They must,
however, inform their counterparts in the USAFA chain of command of such communications.

                                        RETENTION POLICY


9.1. Retention. Retention in the ALO Program is contingent upon satisfactory performance of duty.
ALOs failing to maintain the standards outlined in AFI 36-2612, Air Force Reserve Reenlistment, chapter
3, risk removal from the program. USAFA/RRPR and LOCs may recommend removal from the ALO
Program for unsatisfactory conduct, performance, and lack of participation, or other cause. USAFA/RRP
makes the final decision.

9.2. Training and Currency. ALOs must satisfy initial and periodic USAFA, AFROTC, and local train-
ing requirements to maintain currency.

9.3. Transfers to Other LOC Areas. ALOs support a specific LOC area. Transferees to another LOC
area must obtain approval of the gaining LOC to serve as an ALO in the new area.

9.4. Points for Primary Duty ALOs. Primary duty ALOs assigned to the 9001st ARS must annually
earn at least 48 points for performing ALO duties. Credit for the 15 or more points earned for being in the
primary duty training category does not count towards the 48 ALO duty-points requirement.

9.5. Appearance and Weight Standards. All primary and additional duty ALOs must meet the uniform
requirements and weight and dress standards set forth in AFI 36-2903 and AFI 40-502, Air Force Weight
Management Program.

9.6. Probationary Status. USAFA/RRP may retain an ALO who is deficient in some area in probation-
ary status not to exceed 1 year. At the conclusion of the year, the LOC will submit an evaluation of the
ALO’s performance with a recommendation for continuance or deletion from the program.

9.7. Other. Additional duty ALOs removed from the USAFR, ANG, or active duty for cause lose their
eligibility for ALO duty status.
