SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and requires a complete review. Major changes reflect
recent updates to new DOD continuity related instructions and incorporates guidance for
business continuity as a subset of continuity. This rewrite reflects the transfer of HAF continuity
program, planning and execution responsibilities and associated Pentagon emergency
management and incident command responsibilities to the Air Force District of Washington
(AFDW). It also outlines HAF organizational responsibilities for continuity, personnel
accountability and emergency evacuation. It implements requirements for Balanced Survivability
Assessments in the Air Force. It establishes AF responsibilities for emergency management and
incident command of the Pentagon facilities and authorities for Raven Rock Mountain Complex.

 DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE CONTINUITY AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY
                           GUIDANCE

1.1. Air Force Continuity.
   1.1.1. It is Air Force guidance to maintain a comprehensive and effective continuity
   capability to preserve Air Force functions, missions and capabilities in support of DOD and
   Air Force Primary Mission Essential Functions (PMEFs).
   1.1.2. All levels of command will plan, budget and be prepared to execute their Mission
   Essential Functions (MEFs), support execution of the Air Force and DOD PMEFs, project
   forces supporting Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), and when directed by the Secretary of
   Defense (SecDef), support civil and humanitarian requests.
   1.1.3. Continuity requirements must be incorporated into the daily operations of
   organizations to ensure seamless and immediate continuation of essential functions during
   and after a wide range of emergencies, including local or regional natural disasters, health-
   related emergencies, man-made disasters, accidents, technological limitations or attack-
   related emergencies.
   1.1.4. Air Force military, civilian and contract personnel with continuity responsibilities
   should know what actions to take without warning, across a wide range of potential
   emergencies.
   1.1.5. Continuity is a primary enabler of operational capability.
      1.1.5.1. Continuity is focused on maintaining the capability to perform the mission and
      the essential functions which comprise the mission.
      1.1.5.2. Continuity is best achieved through integration with the suite of programs that
      enable operational capability to continue with limited or no impact to mission execution,
      should an event or other disruption occur. Organizations and installations should develop
      integrated solutions among all programs that most effectively and efficiently enhance
      mission execution. These include integrated defense/force protection, anti-terrorism,
      critical infrastructure program (CIP)/critical asset risk management (CARM) and
      emergency management.
      1.1.5.3. Continuity planning should consider all-hazards, but emphasize events or other
      disruptions which will most likely degrade operations.
      1.1.5.4. Risk management methodologies, focused on the continuation of mission
      capability, should be used to identify and develop mitigation solutions, which should in-
      turn be used to prioritize and justify the allocation of budgetary resources.
   1.1.6. Continuity requires unity of effort between the mission owner and the installation to
   establish protection priorities on the installation.
   1.1.7. Business continuity is a collaborative effort among continuity, integrated defense,
   anti-terrorism and emergency management programs. Business continuity must comply with
   military and civilian personnel policies, to include telework guidance established by Deputy
 6                                                       AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013


     Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1) and computer system security
     requirements established by Chief of Warfighting Integration and Chief Information Officer
     (SAF/CIO A6).
1.2. Continuity Guidance. COOP planning should remain operationally focused on command
and control and prioritized through contingency and crisis planning.
1.3. Continuity Preparedness Objectives.
     1.3.1. Ensure the Air Force can continue its essential functions under all conditions.
     1.3.2. Ensure availability of personnel, critical assets, essential facilities, equipment, records
     and other assets necessary to continue MEFs in the event of a disruption.
     1.3.3. Execute a successful order of succession and/or delegation of authority in the event a
     disruption renders leadership unavailable or incapable of executing their responsibilities
     and/or exercising their authorities.
     1.3.4. Execute return to normal operations upon termination of a continuity event.

                                           Chapter 3

                               COOP PLAN DEVELOPMENT

3.1. Writing COOP Plans. COOP plans should use planning factors contained in this
instruction and War & Mobilization Plan, Vol 1 (WMP-1), Basic Planning. To ensure fully
integrated response operations, commanders should include COOP plans with other installation
plans, such as the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP), Integrated Defense
Plan (IDP), Antiterrorism (AT) Plan, Disease Containment Plans or other plans as long as all
COOP planning factors, risks and controls are addressed. If Commands combine COOP plans
with their other plans, such as CEMP, title the plan "CEMP/COOP- (organization designation)."
Although AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, Planning Formats and Guidance, is the recommended
plan format, organizations can adopt any format that best achieves their planning goals or as
directed by the MAJCOM.
3.1. (AMC)Writing COOP Plans. AMC COOP plans/planning guidance will be focused on
the performance of the critical tasks directly supporting AMC MEFs (See AMC-added
Attachment 7). The second priority of AMC COOP planning is to reconstitute MEFs in primary,
permanent operating locations as quickly as possible, and the third priority is the performance of
business continuity functions (BCFs). Unit COOP planning must address the performance of
critical tasks directly supporting AMC MEFs. BCFs can be addressed IAW paragraph 2.4.6.
and/or be included in other unit planning documents (installation, emergency response, etc.).
   3.1.1. COOP plans should comply with guidance in the following documents:
       3.1.1.1. AFDD 3-10, Force Protection
       3.1.1.2. AFI 10-2604, Disease Containment Planning Guidance – plan for continuation
       of MEFs during a pandemic or other contagious biological event or outbreak.
       3.1.1.3. AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
       Operations – plan for continuation of MEFs during or following a major accident, natural
       disaster, conventional attacks (including high-yield explosives), or terrorist use of
       Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) materials. Incorporates CEMP
       10-2.
       3.1.1.4. AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting – comply with reporting requirements upon
       COOP activation and movement to alternate locations.
       3.1.1.5. AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution – comply with
       reporting requirements.
       3.1.1.6. AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC) – comply with security requirements.
       Develop OPSEC standards based on the priority of the MEF.
       3.1.1.7. AFPD 10-24, Air Force Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP) – implements a
       mission-focused, Air Force Task Critical Asset (TCA) identification and Critical Asset
       Risk Assessment (CARA) process. All CIP critical assets are designated as TCAs, with a
       subset of this list being designated as Defense Critical Assets (DCAs).
       3.1.1.7.1. War Mobilization Plan I (WMP-1) – contains additional factors to assist with
       planning efforts.
AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013                                                             17


       3.1.1.8. AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism
       3.1.1.9. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense.
3.2. Classifying COOP Plans. Classify COOP plans according to content, as required by
applicable overarching program security guidance, MEFs, mission criticality, capabilities, key
personnel movement, compilation of data revealing additional associations or relationships and
the specific plan(s) supported. COOP plans directly supporting the national essential functions
or DoD or AF primary MEFs will be not be marked lower than secret. Other COOP plans will
not be marked lower than For Official Use Only (FOUO).
   3.2.1. Use DoD Defense Continuity Program (DCP) Security Classification Guide, (15 Dec
   05) for details and to determine specific classification decisions ambiguity exists and/or no
   original classification authority (OCA) is available.
   3.2.2. Refer to the “Continuity of Operations (COOP) /Continuity of Government (COG)”
   Community of Practice for the Defense Continuity Security Classification Guidance
   (SIPRNet) or contact coop@pentagon.af.mil or coop@af.pentagon.smil.mil for a copy.
3.3. COOP Plan Review. Organizations are required to validate and update their COOP plan
every two years.
3.4. Elements of a Continuity Plan. COOP plans should be executable with and without
warning, during and after duty hours and should include the following elements:
   3.4.1. Mission Essential Functions. Prior to writing continuity plans, organizations should
   thoroughly analyze their organization’s mission, functions, supporting activities,
   communication and vital records/data necessary for successful mission execution. Refer to
   Attachment 3 for further guidance.
   3.4.1. (AMC) Mission Essential Functions. AMC units will align their critical supporting
   tasks to the AMC Mission Essential Functions as defined in the AMC COOP Plan and
   Attachment 7 to this supplement. See Attachment 7 for the list of AMC MEFs and HQ/18
   AF direct, critical, supporting tasks to the AMC MEFs. These critical supporting tasks are
   the basis for AMC unit COOP planning and must be performed or mitigated under all
   circumstances. See AMC-added Attachment 9 for additional guidance.
       3.4.1.1. Identify MEFs. Prioritize MEFs based on the impact of interruption and degree
       of acceptable interruption.
          3.4.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) AMC units will validate critical supporting tasks to the
          AMC MEFs using the AMC Validating Worksheets (AMC-added Attachment 8) or
          similar process to ensure all MEF critical supporting tasks are captured and non-
          critical tasks that will drive additional costs are eliminated. Unit commanders must
          approve unit MEF critical supporting tasks.
       3.4.1.2. Identify leadership, personnel, facilities, equipment, computer and
       communication technologies, supplies and/or other resources necessary to execute each
       MEF.
   3.4.2. Orders of Succession and/or Delegation of Authority.
18                                                  AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013


     3.4.2.1. Plan for order of succession and/or delegation of authority in the event a
     disruption renders leadership unavailable or incapable of executing their responsibilities
     and/or exercising their authorities.
     3.4.2.2. Commanders will establish, promulgate, and maintain orders of succession and
     delegation of authority for key positions. Orders of succession are an essential part of
     organizations’ continuity plans and should have sufficient breadth, depth and geographic
     dispersal, where feasible.
     3.4.2.3. Procedures and conditions for delegation of authority must be documented in
     COOP plans and should indicate the extent and limits of the delegated authority. The
     description of the conditions for implementation should include specific ‘triggers’ for
     when the permission to act for the principal may be used as well as when that permission

          are not pre-positioned at alternate facilities.
       3.4.6.4. MEFs can be transferred to another organization provided execution timelines
       are met. When MEFs are transferred, COOP plans should include provisions for
       resumption of MEF by the primary staff from an alternate location. Establish
       memorandum of agreement/understanding between organizations.
       3.4.6.5. Disease containment may require other strategies, such as social distancing
       which can be achieved through split shifts, telework, AWS and/or dispersing personnel
       within available work space or to alternate facilities.
   3.4.7. Return to Normal Operations and Reconstitution. Establish plans for return to normal
   operations and/or reconstitution.
       3.4.7.1. For PMEFs and MEFs, plan options for return to normal operations and
       reconstitution regardless of the level of disruption that originally prompted COOP
       execution. This may include moving operations from the continuity or devolution
       location to either the original operating facility or, if necessary, to a new operating
       facility.
       3.4.7.2. Verify that all systems, communications, and other required capabilities are
       available and operational and that the facility is fully capable of accomplishing all
       essential functions and operations.
3.5. Risk Mitigation.
3.5. (AMC)Risk Mitigation. The two primary mitigation strategies innately incorporated into
Mobility Air Forces (MAF) force structure and operating philosophies which ensure AMC MEFs
continue in all environments are: (1) AMC MEF capabilities are redundant and widely dispersed
within active duty and Air Reserve Component (ARC) units based not only throughout the U.S.,
but are operating daily throughout the world; and (2) MAF active duty and ARC units are totally
integrated and equally capable of performing AMC MEFs.
   3.5.1. Apply risk mitigation methodologies during the Readiness and Preparedness/Normal
   Operations Phase to mitigate risk to MEF execution. Refer to Attachment 4 of this AFI for
   further information.
   3.5.2. Plans should place increased planning emphasis on the events most likely to occur and
   which will most likely degrade operations beyond acceptable limits.
3.6. Planning Phases: The COOP implementation process will include the following planning
phases:
   3.6.1. Readiness and Preparedness / Normal Operations Phase. During normal daily
   operations, COOP readiness should ensure identification and protection of
   successors/military authority, accuracy of personnel accountability and readiness of
   relocation sites. As information and intelligence increase the likelihood of an event or other
   disrpution, every effort should be made to plan or implement pre-emptive relocation or
   establish an initial operating capability for critical missions and assets at alternate sites. This
   could also include sending non-essential personnel home as a means of dispersal.
AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013                                                             21


  3.6.2. Activation and Relocation Phase (0-12 hours). This phase begins when operations at
  the primary facility can no longer support MEF execution. During this phase, give priority to
  military operations (including logistical support), continuing Command, Control,
  Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4 ISR) functions,
  transferring personnel and computer data/applications necessary to support operations,
  personnel accountability and damage and residual resource assessment and reporting.
  3.6.3. Alternate Operating Facility Operation Phase. This phase commences with full MEF
  execution with a focus on military operations, communications, transportation, performing
  other essential functions, resource recovery and reconstituting forces. Affected organizations
  should notify command and control agencies of manpower and capability at alternate
  locations.    Refer to AFI 10-206, for reporting requirements. Address the restoration of
  command staffs, capabilities, and functions as resources and operational tasks permit.
  3.6.4. Return to Normal Operations Phase. This phase begins when an appropriate authority
  directs the return to normal operations. During this phase, begin implementing plans to
  resume normal operations. Supervise an orderly return to the normal operating facilities, or
  movement to a temporary or permanent facility. Maintain communication with Command
  and Control (C2) agencies during transition and report mission manpower and capability.

Terms
Antiterrorism (AT)—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and
property to terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military and
civilian forces. AT is one element of Force Protection. (JP 1-02).
Command and Control (C2)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command
and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment,
communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing,
coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
Command and Control Systems (C2 Systems)—The facilities, equipment, communications,
procedures, and personnel essential to a commander for planning, directing, and controlling
operations of assigned and attached forces pursuant to the missions assigned.
Continuity of Government—A coordinated effort within each Branch of Government ensuring
the capability to continue Branch minimum essential responsibilities in a catastrophic crisis.
Continuity of Government is dependent on effective continuity of operations plans and
capabilities. DOD Continuity of Government activities involve ensuring continuity of DOD MEF
through plans and procedures governing succession to office; emergency delegations of authority
(where permissible, and in accordance with applicable law); the safekeeping of vital resources,
facilities, and records; the improvisation or emergency acquisition of vital resources necessary
for the performance of MEF; and the capability to relocate essential personnel and functions to,
and sustain performance of MEF at, alternate work site(s) until normal operations can be
resumed.
Continuity of Operations (COOP)—An internal effort within individual components of the
Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Branches of Government assuring the capability exists to
continue uninterrupted essential component functions across a wide range of potential
emergencies, including local or regional natural disasters, health-related emergencies, accidents,
 30                                                    AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013


and technological and/or attack-related emergencies. COOP involves plans and capabilities
covering the same functional objectives of Continuity of Government, must be maintained at a
high level of readiness, and be capable of implementation both with and without warning. COOP
is not only an integral part of Continuity of Government and Enduring Constitutional
Government (ECG), but is simply "good business practice" - part of the Department of Defense's
fundamental mission as a responsible and reliable public institution.
Crisis—An incident or situation involving a threat to the United States, its territories, citizens,
military forces, possessions, or vital interests that develops rapidly and creates a condition of
such diplomatic, economic, political, or military importance that commitment of U.S. military
forces and resources is contemplated to achieve national objectives.
Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP)—USAF CIP/CARM is a mission assurance, risk
management program. The goal is to assure availability of assets/infrastructure critical to DoD
and AF missions. These include both operational and Title 10 missions and capabilities. The
Program identifies critical assets inside and outside the fence line, mission “impact” caused by
critical asset loss/degradation, and focuses on theater/global impact vs. local impact. It supports
risk management –identifies risk to the asset and impact to the mission.
Defense Continuity Executive Steering Group (Continuity ESG)—Senior representatives
from designated OSD Components, Joint Staff, Military Services, and Defense Agencies that
serve as the "board of directors" for the DCP to provide guidance and oversight for DOD
continuity-related activities, while developing and implementing a DOD-wide continuity strategy
for the twenty-first century threat environment. The Continuity ESG also adjudicates functional
disputes concerning the use of common DOD continuity resources that support the Secretary of
Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Defense Continuity Program (DCP)—An integrated program comprised of defense policies,
plans, procedures, assets, and resources that ensures continuity of DOD Component MEF under
all circumstances, including crisis, attack, recovery, and reconstitution. It encompasses the DOD
Components performing Continuity of Operations, Continuity of Government, and Enduring
Constitutional Government functions across the spectrum of threats to continuity.
Devolution— is the capability to transfer statutory authority and/or responsibility for essential
functions from an agency’s primary operating staff and facilities to other agency employees and
facilities, and to sustain that operational capability for an extended period.
Force Protection (FP)—Members Actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against
DOD personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information.
These actions conserve the force‘s fighting potential so it can be applied at the decisive time and
place and incorporate the coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive measures to
enable the effective employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy.
Force protection does not include actions to defeat the enemy or protect against accidents,
weather, or disease. Also called FP (JP 1-02). Note: The Air Force defines FP as the process of
detecting threats and hazards to the Air Force and its mission, and applying measures to deter,
pre-empt, negate or mitigate them based on an acceptable level of risk.] (AFDD 3-10)
{Italicized definition in brackets applies only to the Air Force and is offered for clarity.}
Emergency Relocation Staff (ERS)—Members directly supporting uninterrupted operational
capability and COOP execution.
AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013                                                                31


Information Assurance (IA)—Information operations that protect and defend information and
information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and
non-repudiation. This includes providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating
protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.
Integrated Defense (ID)—Integrated Defense is the application of active and passive defense
measures, employed across the legally-defined ground dimension of the operational
environment, to mitigate potential risks and defeat adversary threats to Air Force operations.
Also called ID. (AFPD 31-1)
Integrated Defense Council (IDC)—A cross-functional governing body responsible to the
Installation Commander for oversight of installation ID issues. Also called IDC. (AFPD 31-1)

body chaired by the Mission Support Group Commander or designee and is composed of subject
matter experts from multiple functions across the installation, including major tenants and
supported units. The IDWG conducts and coordinates the IDRMP and accomplishes tasks for
the IDC. (AFI 31-101)
Mission Essential Functions (MEF)—The specified or implied tasks required to be performed
by, or derived from, statute or Executive order, and those organizational activities that must be
performed under all circumstances to achieve DOD Component missions or responsibilities in a
continuity threat or event. Failure to perform or sustain these functions would significantly
impact DOD ability to provide vital services, or exercise authority, direction, and control.
National Capital Region (NCR)—The geographic area located within the boundaries of the
District of Columbia; Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties in the State of Maryland;
Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William Counties and the Cities of Alexandria, Fairfax,
Falls Church, Manassas, and Manassas Park in the Commonwealth of Virginia; and all cities and

emergency. These functions must directly support the NEFs and must be submitted/approved by
OSD.
Reconstitution—The rebuilding of an organization by relocating selected personnel from
subordinate organizations to a designated location to assume the mission essential functions
performed by the higher-level organization.
Reconstitution Site—A location selected by the surviving organization as the site at which a
damaged or destroyed function can be reformed by survivors of the event/emergency and
personnel from other sources, designated as replacements.
Relocation Site—The site selected by an organization that is capable of supporting the logistics
and communications necessary to continue an organization’s mission essential functions.
Vital Records—Records essential to the continued functioning or reconstitution of an
organization during and after an emergency and also those records essential to protecting the

rights and interests of that organization and of the individuals directly affected by its activities.
Sometimes called essential records. Include both emergency-operating and rights-and-interests
records. Vital records considerations are part of an agency’s records disaster prevention and
recovery program.

                 DEVELOPING AF MISSION ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS

Prior to writing continuity plans, organizations should complete a thorough analysis of the
mission and functions of the organization, supporting activities, communications, and vital
records/data necessary for successful mission execution.
A4.1. Identify the Mission Essential Function(s). Mission Essential Functions are derived
from, but not limited to, the following sources: DOD directive or instruction, AF policy
directives or instruction, MAJCOM or locally developed instructions, CCDR plans, i.e. concept
plans (CONPLAN), operational plan (OPLAN), tasks assigned through the Defense Readiness
and Reporting System (DRRS) in support of CCDRs or HAF, any memorandum of
understanding (MOUs) or memorandum of agreements (MOAs) or other agreements, and the
organization’s mission statement. MEFs should provide overarching answers to questions, such
as, what function or service does this organization provide to the Air Force and/or DOD?
A4.1. (AMC)AMC MEFs and MEF critical supporting tasks will be validated using the
AMC MEF validation worksheets or a similar validation process. See AMC-added
Attachment 8.
   A4.1.1. Mission Essential Tasks do not readily equate to MEFs. Functions should generally
   describe an activity required to achieve a desired goal, mission or organizational
   responsibility. The responsibility has been designated or delegated by higher authority.
   Tasks usually are more specific and may generally contribute to the performance of a
   function.
   A4.1.2. An example of a MEF may be, “Ensure Air Force forces are continuously available
   to conduct CONUS air superiority.” This function implies a series of tasks, some which may
   not be readily defined in readiness reporting systems. Response times should be derived
   from higher headquarters.
A4.2. Identify interdependencies necessary to support MEF execution. Interdependencies
can be within and/or outside an organization or installation. Additionally, break the MEF into
subordinate elements or tasks necessary to accomplish the function. For example, an
organization may be tasked to launch F-22s to assist in maintaining air superiority. This task
requires aircraft with crews and maintainers, logistics, security and extensive mission support. A
headquarters staff function may need to provide situational awareness and analysis of the data to
a commander in support of decision-making.
   A4.2.1. Identify the subordinate elements or tasks/services necessary to execute the function.
   Some additional supporting elements may include situational awareness, computer and
   information support staff, and administrative management.
   A4.2.2. Identify any service, equipment, leaders and staff, facilities, communication
   capability, data/information, or other supporting infrastructure necessary to perform the
   function. Areas to consider, but not limited to, include: command and control, command
   decisions and strategies, crisis communications (including alerts and notifications), crisis data
   storage, retrieval and security, legal obligations, fiscal and contractual obligations, and
   personnel.
AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013                                                             41


A4.3. Identify the impact and consequences over time should these functions not be
performed. This should establish the acceptable degree of interruption in the MEF execution
during a crisis.
   A4.3.1. Determine what higher order MEF and/or organization this function supports.
   A4.3.2. Assess the impact and consequences over time if these functions fail.
       A4.3.2.1. Assess the maximum time period a function can be suspended without
       consequences.
       A4.3.2.2. Assess the minimum functional level that must be achieved upon resumption.
       A4.3.2.3. Assess the length of time normal functional levels must be achieved.
       A4.3.2.4. Contact the organizations which the function supports for guidance in
       determining the acceptable degree of interruption. For example, contact Wing Plans
       offices for response requirements outlined in OPLANS. MAJCOMs should provide
       guidance to subordinate organizations on OPLAN response requirements.
A4.4. Prioritize organizational MEFs, based on information above.
   A4.4.1. MEFs – broader set of essential functions – must be continued throughout or
   resumed rapidly after normal activities are disrupted. These enable the Air Force to execute
   vital missions and services, maintain safety, and sustain the industrial/economic base during
   disruption of normal operations. This includes incident management responsibilities.
       A4.4.1.1. Primary MEFs (PMEFs) must directly support the National Essential
       Functions (NEFs), execute before, during and in the aftermath of an emergency and be
       performed continuously or resumed within 12 hours of an event and maintained up to 30
       days after an event or until normal operations can be resumed. PMEFs must be submitted
       and approved by OSD.
       A4.4.1.1.1. MEFs must be performed continuously or resumed within 12 hours of an
       event and maintained up to 30 days after an event or until normal operations can be
       resumed.
   A4.4.2. Business Continuity MEFs – Support activities that should be continued or resumed
   whenever practical after a disruption of normal activities, but can accept a delay or minimal
   operating capability.
A4.5. Identify the connection between the higher headquarters MEF this organization
MEF supports.

                           RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

A5.1. Apply risk management principles to all continuity planning elements. Risk
management identifies, controls and minimizes the impact of uncertain events. This process
supports the overarching Continuity Program Management Cycle by identifying (1) the critical
risks to organizational readiness and (2) the strategies that best mitigate the risks. Commanders
should apply risk management principles to guide decisions about when, where, and how to
invest in resources that eliminate, control or mitigate mission risk. Continuity strategies should
seek to improve resilience to mission disruption by ensuring critical MEFs continue at, or are
recovered to, an acceptable minimum level and within acceptable timeframes.
   A5.1.1. Risk assessments performed through other mission assurance programs, such as the
   Critical Asset Risk Assessment (CARA) may be applied to build a COOP risk assessment.
   A5.1.2. Risk as a function of threats, vulnerabilities and consequences is a permanent
   condition.
   A5.1.3. Reviewing an organization’s risks and risk management programs must consider
   additional factors such as mission/function impact, threat/hazard, and vulnerability
   assessments.
   A5.1.4. Further, cost may also be a factor to consider, because informed decisions about
   acceptable and unacceptable risk levels will ultimately drive the resources expenditures (i.e.,
   money, people, and time) to mitigate risk.
   A5.1.5. Risk can never be fully mitigated; no organization can afford to counter every threat
   to its mission. Successful continuity planning demands an intelligent analysis and
   prioritization of where and when to focus resources and apply funding or other assets.
   A5.1.6. A continuity threat assessment integrates a historical review of past events that have
   affected normal operations (e.g., natural disasters; disruptions of communication, power, and
   other utilities; threats to public safety) with a dynamic analysis of other potential threats,
   such as acts of terrorism (from both foreign and domestic agents) and war.
   A5.1.7. This process supports the overarching Continuity Program Management Cycle by
   identifying (1) the critical risks to organizational readiness and (2) the strategies that best
   mitigate the risks.
   A5.1.8. The recommended risk management cycle is made up of four analytical and
   management phases. The following sections describe the key elements that an organization’s
   analysis team should address in each of the phase.
A5.2. Phase 1 – Risk Assessment. Answer the following three questions: (1) what can go
wrong, (2) what is the likelihood that the undesired event might occur, and (3) what would be the
impact should it occur? Critical steps in this phase include:
   A5.2.1. Prioritize the organizational MEFs. Fundamental to this evaluation is the criteria
   used to measure MEF value or the consequence of loss. Consequences should be evaluated
   as an inability to execute the MEF, consider both short- and long-term impacts as well as
   intended and unintended effects from threats/hazards.
AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013                                                                 43


   A5.2.2. Identify the threat-hazards that can impact delivery of the critical functions. Threat is
   the likelihood that an event or other disruption will occur. This step would include exploring
   potential natural events, intentional man-made events, and unintentional man-made events
   that could adversely affect the ability of the organization to perform MEFs. Natural hazards
   are those where the occurrence is beyond the control of the organization, including
   earthquakes, floods, ice storms, winter weather, and external fires. Intentional man-made
   hazards are also beyond the direct control of the organization and could include events such
   as external sabotage, and terrorism. Unintentional man-made events, such as power outages,
   fires, explosions, equipment failures, or human errors may or may not be within the
   organization control.
   A5.2.3. Assess the Vulnerability. Develop the vulnerability assessment. Vulnerability is the
   likelihood that an event or other disruption would succeed, or that the event will result in the
   expected level of consequence.               To identify vulnerabilities assess existing
   safeguards/countermeasures in place to reduce either the likelihood (e.g., security
   countermeasures) or consequence (e.g., redundant capabilities) of the hazard. Identify
   existing safeguards/countermeasures. Identify the existing safeguards that are in place to
   reduce either the likelihood (e.g., security countermeasures) or consequence (e.g., redundant
   capabilities) of the hazard. Utilize CARA after-action reports, vulnerability assessments or
   IDRMP reports and the impact of other mission assurance plans.
A5.3. Phase 2 – Strategic Goals, Objectives, and Constraints. This phase involves
establishing the scope and structure of the risk-informed decision making process. Critical steps
in this phase include:
   A5.3.1. Understand and define the decision. For this effort, the critical question is: How
   should I invest my limited resources across the four continuity pillars – leadership, staff,
   facilities and communications – to ensure that my organization satisfies its continuity
   requirements?
   A5.3.2. Determine who should be involved. Incorporate those who should be involved in the
   decision-making and those who will be affected by actions resulting from the process. Input
   from higher headquarters and commanders are essential to a sound risk management process.
   A5.3.3. Identify the factors that will influence the decisions. The decision to invest resources
   for meeting continuity requirements is not based on only one factor. Decision makers must
   simultaneously weigh multiple factors, including costs, timelines, and risks.
A5.4. Phase 3 – Evaluation of Alternates. For many events, the current risk may be
considered to be at an acceptable level. For those events where the current level of risk is deemed
to be unacceptable, take risk mitigation action. Critical steps in this phase include:
   A5.4.1. Develop alternate risk management strategies. Engage the appropriate decision-
   makers to determine how the risks for each event can be managed most effectively. These
   alternate strategies should be completely developed and documented by addressing all
   critical factors (e.g., cost, schedule).
   A5.4.2. Assess the risk impact of the proposed strategies. The analysis team should reassess
   the risk of each event based on the implementation of each alternative strategy. This step will
   provide the risk reduction value of each of the alternate strategies.
 44                                                    AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013


A5.5. Phase 4 – Management Selection.
   A5.5.1. Once the alternative strategies are fully developed and their risk reduction value has
   been quantified, the process moves to the selection phase. During this phase, decision
   makers choose alternatives for implementation. The alternatives will be evaluated based on
   consideration of all of the previously identified critical factors, including effectiveness (risk
   reduction), efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
   A5.5.2. Another critical factor that should be considered is the confidence or belief that the
   alternative will achieve the projected level of performance. The effect of many of the
   alternative strategies may be well understood by the organization. For instance, these
   alternatives may have a proven track record of performance within other similar
   organizations, or they may have been extensively studied, as part of another program, such as
   CIP/CARM through a completed CARA.

        AMC MISSION ESSENTIAL FUNCTION VALIDATION WORKSHEETS

Purpose: Comply with DODI 3020.26 and AFI 10-208 MEF selection direction to identify those
organizational activities that must be performed under all circumstances to achieve DoD and
component missions or responsibilities during a continuity threat or event. Failure to perform these
functions would significantly affect the DoD capability to provide vital services or exercise authority,
direction, and control. Supporting tasks to AMC MEFs that do not meet the Table 1 source,
criticality assessment and time sensitivity tests should not be considered a COOP critical supporting
task and therefore should not be considered a “must perform” task under COOP. If the tasks do not
meet the tests in Table 1, they should be considered business continuity functions and completed
based on unit priority and capability to perform (personnel, equipment, supplies available).
Instructions for completing worksheet:
Worksheet intent: Organizations to list and validates its MEF critical supporting tasks under each of
the AMC MEFs.
Organization Column. List organization associated with the MEF critical supporting task.
MEF Critical Supporting Task. List unit MEF critical supporting task under the applicable C2,
Direct, or Support headers.
Task Source Columns. List the applicable source(s) requiring the unit to accomplish the task.
Provide the source(s) under the applicable column headings. If the source comes from one of the
“Task Source” headers, then the task meets the “Source Test.” Place a “Y” under the “Source Test
Met” column. If the source does not come from the one of the “Task Source” headers, then place an
“N” under the “Source Test Met” column. If the task does not meet the Source Test, then careful
consideration should occur before confirming as a Critical Supporting Task to an AMC MEF.
Requirements Column. Identify requirements to accomplish the task. This includes people,
equipment, information technology (IT) systems, databases, etc.
Criticality Assessment Test Column. Identify products, operations, and organizations impacted if the
task is not performed. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest criticality, identify the impact
on AMC ability to perform associated MEF.
Time Sensitivity Test Column. Identify how long a task can go without being performed. The
longer a task can go without having a significant negative impact on AMC accomplishing a MEF, the
less likely it is a critical supporting task. If a task can go greater than 30 days without being
performed and has little impact on AMC being able to accomplish its MEFs, then the task is probably
not a critical supporting task. Place a “Y” in the “Time Sensitive” column if the task cannot go
longer than 24 hours without being performed and has significant negative impact on AMC ability to
perform a MEF. Careful thought should occur before placing a “Y” in the “Time Sensitive” column
if the “30 day” column is marked.
Note: Some examples have been placed in the columns to provide examples of what is expected.

                               Attachment 9 (Added-AMC)
                      AMC COOP PLAN / PLANNING GUIDANCE

A9.1. (AMC) Purpose. To clearly communicate the MAJCOM requirements for AMC COOP
Plans.
A9.2. (AMC) SITUATION. The Mobility Air Force (MAF) enterprise is designed with built-
in continuity of operations (COOP) concepts which minimizes single points of failure and
maximizes its capability of performing its MEFs under all circumstances.
   A9.2.1. (AMC) Redundancy. Providing airlift, air refueling (AR), aeromedical evacuation
   (AE), and global air mobility support system (GAMSS) capabilities are the cornerstones to
   AMC performing MEF #1 (executing the USTRANSCOM air component mission). AMC
   airlift, AR, AE, and GAMSS forces have redundancy built into its force structure.
      A9.2.1.1. (AMC) Airlift. AMC has three organic airlift (C-5, C-17, and C-130) and two
      organic tanker (KC-135 and KC-10) aircraft capable of performing the airlift mission
      operating from numerous CONUS locations. The CONUS capability is augmented with
      OCONUS airlift capability from PACAF and USAFE. The airlift capability can also be
      augmented through AMC and AETC training assets, volunteerism from airlift/tanker
      forces in the Air Reserve Component (ARC) from numerous CONUS locations, and
      through contracting commercial passenger and cargo carriers, both foreign and US
      carriers. SecDef can also mobilize the ARC and/or activate CRAF to ensure AMC can
      provide airlift forces during any COOP event. This force structure ensures when a
      decreased capability occurs from a specific location or aircraft that the remaining
      locations and aircraft can continue to perform the airlift function.
      A9.2.1.2. (AMC) Air refueling (AR). AMC has two model design series (MDS)
      organic aircraft and five active duty AR units (3 KC-135, 2 KC-10) from five separate
      CONUS locations. The AMC AR capability can be augmented by using AMC and
      AETC training assets, PACAF and USAFE AR assets, ARC volunteerism, and/or
      mobilization of over 20 tanker ARC units stationed throughout the US. There is also
      some limited commercial AR contract capability.
      A9.2.1.3. (AMC) Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). AMC has two active duty CONUS
      AE squadrons that are augmented by 28 ARC units (through volunteerism and/or
      mobilization) and two OCONUS squadrons.
      A9.2.1.4. (AMC) Global air mobility support system (GAMSS). AMC GAMSS
      consists of a CONUS based Contingency Response Wing with deployable forces
      (comprised of 4 Contingency Response Groups and two Contingency Operations Support
      Groups) and two OCONUS based Air Mobility Operations Wings (one in the Pacific
      theater and one in the European theater) each comprised of seven fixed ports.
   A9.2.2. (AMC) The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) and contingency force tasking
   processes enable units to reclama tasking due to an inability to meet the requirement. AEF
   taskings are generally forecasted at least 18 months in advance and normally tasked 6 – 8
   months in advance to the required combatant command in-place date. Contingency taskings
   are generally just-in-time taskings that do not allow units to plan. During a COOP scenario
 60                                                   AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013


   where an AMC unit is not capable of providing an AEF or contingency expeditionary combat
   support (ECS) force tasking, it will shortfall/reclama the tasking via the normal ECS reclama
   process. The normal process is the unit shortfalls/reclamas the requirement back to the
   MAJCOM FAM, the FAM will validate the reclama, and then either task another AMC unit
   for the requirement or reclama the tasking back to AFPC. Unit COOP plans will address its
   capability to communicate shortfalls/reclamas.
       A9.2.2.1. (AMC) USTRANSCOM operational or operational support force tasking
       shortfalls. During a COOP scenario where an AMC unit is not capable of providing an
       operational or operational support force (aircraft, aircrew, aircraft maintenance…)
       tasking, the unit shortfalls or reclamas the tasking back to the MAJCOM FAM, the FAM
       will validate the reclama, and re-task the requirement to another unit, if possible. If the
       circumstances prevent the FAM from re-tasking the requirement, due to time constraints,
       the 618 AOC (TACC) may redirect the tasking to another unit, if possible. For COOP,
       each unit must ensure it is capable of communicating the shortfall/reclama to TACC
       and/or the applicable MAJCOM FAM.
   A9.2.3. (AMC) GAMSS COOP mitigating CONOPS. Redundancy is the primary COOP,
   built-in concept of the GAMSS. Lines of communication for the AMC fixed GAMSS’
   location during contingency operations are described in various OPLANS. During the
   execution of these OPLANS if a COOP event occurs at a location, the USTRANSCOM
   AFFOR, in conjunction with the applicable theater, will reroute the lines of communication
   to avoid the COOP event area, as necessary, to ensure combatant commanders force
   requirements are met. The same concept holds true for non-contingency sustainment
   requirements. If a GAMSS location MEF capability is impacted due to a COOP event, then
   the AMC MAJCOM staff, in conjunction with, the USAF EC, 18 AF and 618 AOC (TACC)
   staffs, as applicable, will adjust the airflow (decrease the airflow to the affected location
   and/or reroute the airflow through other fixed locations to avoid the affected location) to
   most effectively and efficiently meet the GAMSS and theater sustainment requirements.
   This capability can also be enhanced through the use of contingency response forces (CRF).
   The CRF will deploy and stand up in a location which will enhance the overall delivery of
   cargo/personnel.
A9.3. (AMC) AMC COOP Plan Intent. Continuity of operations is most effective when
integrated with other unit programs and plans, including emergency management plans, anti-
terrorism plans, disease containment plans, critical asset risk management (CARM)
programs/plans, aircraft evacuation plans… Since unit continuity of operations concepts already
exist in these programs/plans, the overall intent for AMC unit COOP planning is for units to tie
these COOP concepts in other unit planning documents together. This can be accomplished in
four ways: (a) developing a stand-alone COOP Plan and referencing the COOP concepts/courses
of action in other documents; (b) including a COOP section or sections within existing plans or
documents; (c) incorporating an appendix or annex into an existing unit plan, such as the
Installation Emergency Management Plan (currently known as the CEMP); or (d) a combination
of (b) and (c). COOP plans/sections/appendixes/annexes must be operationally focused and
based on how the unit’s MEF supporting capabilities support AMC MEFs and the overall
capabilities of the MAF enterprise. The unit COOP plans/sections/appendixes/annexes will
focus on its critical capabilities directly supporting AMC MEFs, including its command and
control functions, and how the unit and/or the MAF enterprise will mitigate these capabilities
AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013                                                               61


during a COOP event or the threat of a COOP event. Unit COOP plans/CONOPS will cover
local and remote courses of action/mitigation strategies to maximize the unit’s AMC MEF
critical supporting capabilities (unit/smaller picture) and to verbalize MAF enterprise strategies
to minimize the negative impact to the overall MAF enterprise MEF capabilities (MAF big
picture). Unit COOP planning should not duplicate information in other plans, directives,
policies or guidance, but should refer to the information.
A9.4. (AMC) AMC Unit Specific Plan Requirements.
   A9.4.1. (AMC) 18 AF, USAF EC, and 618 AOC (TACC) will each develop a stand-alone
   COOP Plan or develop an appendix to Annex C of the AMC COOP Plan.
   A9.4.2. (AMC) Flying units. Flying wings and other operational wings, that are installation
   host units, should incorporate its COOP planning into the Installation Emergency
   Management (IEM) Plan (currently called the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan
   (CEMP). The name of a combined plan will be IAW AFI 10-208 guidance. Each unit must
   address how it will ensure the continuity of its AMC MEF supporting capabilities during a
   COOP event or the threat of a COOP event, including its command and control and other
   operational functions. COOP planning should include: (a) sheltering in-place, (b)
   evacuation/relocation, (c) transferring responsibility, (d) disease containment, (e) alternate
   work locations, (f) MAJCOM/MAF enterprise mitigation strategies, (g) aircraft evacuation,
   etc., as applicable.
   A9.4.3. (AMC) Joint Base (JB) Supporting Component Organization (Lead JB units). In
   addition to complying with the requirements for flying units, an AMC JB supporting
   component organization will ensure it coordinates with tenant units on its
   capabilities/responsibilities to support tenant unit COOP MEFs. Develop MOAs with the
   Joint Base Supported Components, as necessary and within constraints of the OSD Joint
   Base MOA and Common Output level Standards (COLS), to address any gaps.
   A9.4.4. (AMC) AMC tenant units. AMC tenant unit, including tenant flying units, are
   responsible for its mission capabilities directly supporting AMC MEFs. Tenant units, not
   geographically separated from parent wings, must develop COOP Plans or incorporate
   COOP planning in other unit plans. Other unit plans can include support agreements, MOAs,
   annexes/appendixes in host unit plans, etc. Tenant units geographically separated from
   parent wings may incorporate COOP planning in the parent wing’s COOP Plan. Support
   required from host units to ensure continuity of its supporting capabilities to AMC MEFs
   must be addressed in host-tenant COOP planning, agreements or other memorandums of
   agreement (MOAs).
   A9.4.5. (AMC) Joint Base (JB) Supported Component Organizations. AMC Joint Base
   supported organizations are responsible for the COOP planning for its mission capabilities
   directly supporting AMC MEFs. AMC supported units on Joint Bases will ensure its
   continuity of operations by one of following methods: (a) developing a stand-alone COOP
   Plan for supporting AMC MEFs under their direct control, (b) including a COOP section or
   sections within existing unit plans or documents; (c) incorporating an appendix or annex into
   an existing unit plan; or (d) a combination of (b) and (c). Develop MOAs with the Joint Base
   Supporting Component, as necessary and within constraints of the OSD Joint Base MOA and
   COLS, to address any gaps. AMC Joint Base supported organizations will coordinate its
   COOP planning with the Joint Base supporting organization.

   A9.4.6. (AMC) Global Air Mobility Support System (GAMSS) COOP units. Air Mobility
   Operations Wings (AMOWs) will develop COOP Plans or incorporate COOP planning into
   other unit contingency plans/CONOPS. AMOW geographically separated units may be
   included in parent AMOW COOP plans/planning.
   A9.4.7. (AMC) AMC units should address critical unit business continuity functions. This
   may be accomplished through referencing other unit plans or issued guidance.
   A9.4.8. (AMC) Local (current base/location) and remote (out of local area) relocation sites,
   if applicable, will be addressed in unit COOP plans/planning. If a unit’s AMC MEF critical
   supporting tasks are transferred to other units, then relocation to remote sites may not be
   required.
A9.5. (AMC) Unit MEF supporting capabilities that must be addressed in unit COOP
plans/CONOPS.
   A9.5.1. (AMC) Command and Control (C2). Each unit will address connectivity with its
   forces and the AMC/CC, TF-294/CC (if applicable), and other C2 functions, as applicable.
   A9.5.2. (AMC) Airlift, AR and AE capabilities, as applicable, to AMC MEFs.
   A9.5.3. (AMC) GAMSS supporting functions, as applicable, to AMC MEFs.
   A9.5.4. (AMC) Ability to provide forces to combatant commanders, as applicable, to AMC
   MEFs.
   A9.5.5. (AMC) Any critical organize, train, and equip capability that meets the MEF impact
   criteria and time sensitivity tests IAW the AMC MEF validation worksheets in AMC-added
   Attachment 8.
   A9.5.6. (AMC) Unique capabilities directly related to AMC MEFs…special ops, etc.
   A9.5.7. (AMC) Integrated Network Security Center (I-NOSC) and/or Enterprise Service
   Desk support should be addressed with local host or local Air Force Space Command
   (AFSPC) support organizations. Any support issues that are not able to be resolved at the
   local level will be elevated to MAJCOM.
A9.6. (AMC) Unit COOP Plan assumptions.
   A9.6.1. (AMC) Operational command and control is key to COOP. Connectivity with
   AMC/AF and subordinate forces is a unit’s first responsibility during a COOP event, after
   life-saving emergency response actions.
   A9.6.2. (AMC) Units can expect AMC MEF related taskings to be adjusted by the tasking
   authority, based on the unit’s capability to perform.
   A9.6.3. (AMC) Emergency response, force protection, anti-terrorism, force health
   protection are IAW with other unit/installation plans and should not be duplicated in COOP
   plans/planning.
AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013                                                           63


  A9.6.4. (AMC) Alternate facilities/locations should be selected based on their capability of
  performing the unit’s critical supporting tasks to the AMC MEFs, i.e., a C-17 airlift wing
  should relocate to another location with C-17s…the infrastructure to support the aircraft is

                    AMC UNIT COOP PLAN/PLANNING TEMPLATE

Note: COOP Plans when completed or when relocation sites are listed are classified
“SECRET.” Do not add relocation sites to this template on a NIPR computer.


Note: This template is designed for a unit to complete and to be used as a basis for stand-alone
COOP Plan or to be completed and incorporated into another unit planning document, such as
the CEMP or IEM Plan.
A10.1. (AMC) References. See AMC COOP Plan (https://eim.amc.af.smil.mil/sites/a3o/COOP/
default.aspx) in the AMC COOP Plan 2012 folder.
A10.2. (AMC) Purpose. Support the execution of the AMC mission essential function (MEFs)
during a COOP event or the threat of a COOP event, whether naturally occurring or manmade,
when unit personnel are significantly degraded or not capable of performing AMC MEF critical
supporting tasks using normal operating locations and/or methods. AMC MEFs are:
   A10.2.1. (AMC) MEF Priority #1: Execute the USTRANSCOM air component mission of
   rapid global mobility (airlift, air refueling (AR), aeromedical evacuation (AE), and global air
   mobility support system (GAMSS)).
   A10.2.2. (AMC) MEF Priority #2: Provide forces to combatant commanders (other than
   USTC) as directed by SecDef and CJCS taskings, and in line with national objectives and
   military strategy.
   A10.2.3. (AMC) MEF Priority #3: Organize, train and equip forces.
A10.3. (AMC) Applicability. This plan applies to (list unit, including geographical separated
(if applicable) that the unit’s COOP Plan applies).
A10.4. (AMC) SITUATION. The (unit’s name) supports AMC MEFs 1, 2, and 3 (as
applicable) by providing (select applicable forces) airlift/air refueling (AR)/aeromedical
evacuation (AE)/global air mobility support system (GAMSS) forces and training/equipping
MAF personnel. The Mobility Air Force (MAF) enterprise is designed with built-in continuity
of operations (COOP) concepts which minimizes single points of failure and maximizes its
capability of performing its MEFs under all circumstances.
   A10.4.1. (AMC) Redundancy. The MAF enterprise has redundancy built into its force
   structure to insure its capability to perform MEFs 1, 2, and 3. (Select sub paragraphs that
   apply and delete others)
       A10.4.1.1. (AMC) Airlift. AMC has three organic airlift (C-5, C-17, and C-130) and
       two organic tanker (KC-135 and KC-10) aircraft capable of performing the airlift mission
       operating from numerous CONUS locations. The CONUS capability is augmented with
       OCONUS airlift capability from PACAF and USAFE. The airlift capability can also be
       augmented through AMC and AETC training assets, volunteerism from airlift/tanker
       forces in the Air Reserve Component (ARC) from numerous CONUS locations, and
       through contracting commercial passenger and cargo carriers, both foreign and US
       carriers. SecDef can also mobilize the ARC and/or activate CRAF to ensure AMC can
AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013                                                             65


     provide airlift forces during any COOP event. This force structure ensures when a
     decreased capability occurs from a specific location or aircraft that the remaining
     locations and aircraft can continue to perform the airlift function.
     A10.4.1.2. (AMC) Air refueling (AR). AMC has two model design series (MDS)
     organic aircraft and five active duty AR units (3 KC-135, 2 KC-10) from five separate
     CONUS locations. The AMC AR capability can be augmented by using AMC and
     AETC training assets, PACAF and USAFE AR assets, ARC volunteerism, and/or
     mobilization of over 20 tanker ARC units stationed throughout the US. There is also
     some limited commercial AR contract capability.
     A10.4.1.3. (AMC) Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). AMC has two active duty CONUS
     AE squadrons that are augmented by 28 ARC units (through volunteerism and/or
     mobilization) and two OCONUS squadrons.
     A10.4.1.4. (AMC) Global air mobility support system (GAMSS). AMC GAMSS
     consists of a CONUS based Contingency Response Wing with deployable forces
     (comprised of 4 Contingency Response Groups and two Contingency Operations Support
     Groups) and two OCONUS based Air Mobility Operations Wings (one in the Pacific
     theater and one in the European theater) each comprised of seven fixed ports.
  A10.4.2. (AMC) Flexible force tasking process. Flexibility in the AF and MAF tasking
  process allows the MAF enterprise to better accomplish AMC MEFs 1 and 2.
     A10.4.2.1. (AMC) The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) and contingency force tasking
     processes enable units to reclama tasking due to an inability to meet the requirement.
     AEF taskings are generally forecasted at least 18 months in advance and normally tasked
     6 – 8 months in advance to the required combatant command in-place date. Contingency
     taskings are generally just-in-time taskings that do not allow units to plan. During a
     COOP scenario where an AMC unit is not capable of providing an AEF or contingency
     expeditionary combat support (ECS) force tasking, it will shortfall/reclama the tasking
     via the normal ECS reclama process. The normal process is the unit shortfalls/reclamas
     the requirement back to the MAJCOM FAM, the FAM will validate the reclama, and
     then either task another AMC unit for the requirement or reclama the tasking back to
     AFPC.
     A10.4.2.2. (AMC) USTRANSCOM operational or operational support force tasking
     shortfalls. During a COOP scenario where an AMC unit is not capable of providing an
     operational or operational support force (aircraft, aircrew, aircraft maintenance…)
     tasking, the unit shortfalls or reclamas the tasking back to the MAJCOM FAM, the FAM
     will validate the reclama, and re-task the requirement to another unit, if possible. If the
     circumstances prevent the FAM from re-tasking the requirement, due to time constraints,
     the 618 AOC (TACC) may redirect the tasking to another unit, if possible.
  A10.4.3. (AMC) GAMSS COOP CONOPS. Redundancy and flexibility are the two
  primary COOP, built-in concepts of continuity for the GAMSS to ensure accomplishment of
  MEF 1. AMC has numerous fixed GAMSS locations in the CONUS, Pacific and European
  Theaters and its contingency operations/lines of communication are described in various
  OPLANS. During the execution of these OPLANS if a COOP event occurs at a location, the
  USTRANSCOM AFFOR, in conjunction with the applicable theater, will adjust the lines of
 66                                                    AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013


   communication to avoid the COOP event area, as necessary, to ensure combatant
   commanders force requirements are met. The same concept holds true for non-contingency
   sustainment requirements. If a GAMSS location MEF capability is impacted due to a COOP
   event, then the AMC MAJCOM staff, in conjunction with, USAF EC, 18 AF and 618 AOC
   (TACC) staffs will adjust the airflow (decrease the airflow to the affected location and/or
   reroute the airflow through other fixed or mobile locations to avoid the affected location) to
   most effectively and efficiently meet the GAMSS and theater sustainment requirements.
   This capability can also be enhanced through the use of contingency response forces (CRF).
   The CRF will deploy and stand up in a location which will enhance the overall delivery of
   cargo/personnel.
A10.5. (AMC) Execution. The (unit’s name)/CC is responsible for unit COOP execution.
COOP execution actions should be coordinated with the chain of command, including AMC/CC,
18 AF/CC or USAF EC/CC (as applicable) and 618 AOC (TACC). OPREP requirements apply.
   A10.5.1. (AMC) Concept of Operations (CONOPS). This COOP Plan/planning courses of
   action will ensure that (unit’s name) is able to best perform its critical supporting tasks to the
   AMC MEFs during a COOP event or the threat of a COOP event.. (Unit’s name) will ensure
   performance of its critical supporting tasks through relocation, transfer of responsibilities,
   disease containment procedures, or other mitigation strategies, as dictated by the COOP
   situation and mitigating strategies listed in Table 1.
   A10.5.2. (AMC) Unit Key Assumptions and Planning Factors:
      A10.5.2.1. (AMC) First and foremost (unit’s name) will focus on the performance of its
      critical tasks listed in Table 1 that directly support AMC MEFs. The second priority
      during COOP is to reconstitute the critical tasks in primary, permanent operating
      locations as quickly as possible, and the third priority is the performance of business
      continuity functions, as resources allow.
      A10.5.2.2. (AMC) This COOP Plan may be executed with or without warning and in
      either a permissive or non-permissive environment.
      A10.5.2.3. (AMC) AMC MEF related taskings will be adjusted by the tasking authority,
      based on the (unit’s name) capability to perform.
      A10.5.2.4. (AMC) Emergency response, force protection, anti-terrorism, and force
      health protection are IAW with other unit/installation plans.
      A10.5.2.5. (AMC) Risk management is IAW the unit’s Installation Emergency
      Management Program, Disease Containment, Anti-Terrorism, and other unit operational
      plans; unit threat working group guidance, operational risk management (ORM) and
      other DoD/AF/AMC/unit risk management requirements. Risk mitigation for unit critical
      assets is IAW unit’s Critical Asset Risk Management (CARM) Program and AMCI 10-
      2402, Critical Asset Risk Management (CARM) Program.
   A10.5.3. (AMC) Mission essential function (MEF) critical tasks. Table 1 lists the (unit’s
   name) critical supporting tasks to the AMC MEFs (in priority order) and the primary
   methods/mitigation strategies to be used to maximize the unit’s capability to support AMC
   MEFs. Table 2 lists (unit’s name (JB lead unit or host wing)) critical supporting
   tasks/responsibilities to tenant/supported organizations MEFs.
AFI10-208_AMCSUP_I 17 APRIL 2013                                                               67


Note: Methods include relocation to local/remote site, and/or transfer of tasking/responsibility.
For a pandemic influenza and infectious disease (PI&ID) outbreak scenario, methods include
telework, social distancing, and sanitation practices, etc.).

                              Attachment 11 (Added-AMC)
   COOP PLANNING TEMPLATE FOR UNIT DISEASE CONTAINMENT PLAN

A11.1. (AMC) CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS (COOP).
  A11.1.1. (AMC) General. Ensuring a unit is able to perform its AMC mission essential
  function (MEF) critical supporting tasks is the number one priority after saving lives. MEF
  continuity of operations actions are different during a Pandemic Influenza and/or Infectious
  Disease (PI&ID) outbreak than a COOP event that affects the infrastructure of an
  organization. During a COOP event, such as a tornado or terrorist bombing attack that
  affects an organization’s infrastructure, the organization will relocate its capability to
  perform mission essential functions (MEFs) to another location conducive to performing the
  MEFs. This may be a location on the same base or a more remote location depending on the
  severity of the damage to the local infrastructure and the threat. During a PI&ID outbreak,
  an organization’s infrastructure is usually not directly impacted. The availability of an
  organization’s personnel is the limiting factor in accomplishing MEFs. COOP actions will
  be based on workload and function prioritization, personnel availability/management, and
  disease containment vice infrastructure strategies.
  A11.1.2. (AMC) COOP PI&ID Assumptions.
     A11.1.2.1. (AMC) Influenza Outbreaks. PI outbreak waves will last for 6-12 week
     periods, or longer, and will re-occur for 12-24 months. Expect a 40% absentee rate
     (military, civilian, and contractors) for two weeks during peak periods. Effects of PI&ID
     on family members will also affect the availability and performance of personnel. Use
     two waves as planning baseline, but multiple waves can occur, due to the ability of the
     influenza virus to mutate.
     A11.1.2.2. (AMC) Vaccine. An effective vaccine will not be available for up to six
     months after clinical confirmation of sustained human-to-human transmission.
     Competing health requirements will limit the DoD initial supply of the vaccine and
     antivirals.
     A11.1.2.3. (AMC) Infrastructure. Communication and physical infrastructure will be
     in-place and any reduction in capability will be the result of a lack of personnel (absent
     due to illness or taking care of family) to properly sustain the infrastructure.
     A11.1.2.4. (AMC) Work Force. A properly prepared, educated, trained, and equipped
     work force will more effectively accomplish the unit MEF tasks during a PI&ID
