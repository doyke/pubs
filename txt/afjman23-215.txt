    SUMMARY of CHANGE
AR 735–11–2/DLAI 4140.55/SECNAVIST 4355.18A/AFJMAN 23–215
REPORTING OF SUPPLY DISCREPANCIES

This publication of 6 August 2001 modifies multiple areas of SDR guidance as
follows--

o   Management Evaluation. The management evaluation responsibilities are
    strengthened to include a semi-annual reporting requirement and specific
    report content and measurements.

o   Credit Adjustments on SDRs. Additional instruction is provided for SA follow-
    up on credit adjustments.

o   Requests for Reconsideration. The “SDR reply date” which is used as a basis
    for the submission timeframe for SA customer requests for reconsideration is
    clarified as the date of the ILCO reply to the customer following receipt of
    disposition from the inventory control point/distribution depot. A timeframe
    is established for the ILCO to forward the customer’s request for
    reconsideration to the responsible action activity. In addition, a timeframe
    is established for the ILCO to notify the action activity that extenuating
    circumstances will necessitate additional time for the customer or ILCO to
    complete/process the request. This will allow the action activity to retain
    applicable records that might otherwise have been purged during an extensive
    delay.

o   Contested Reconsideration Decisions. A timeframe is specified for ILCO to
    forward customer’s contested reconsideration decision to their Service focal
    point.

o   SA Time Standards. Timeframes for actions associated with requests for
    reconsideration and contested reconsideration as reflected in this change are
    summarized in table 1, in paragraph 1d(5).

This regulation has been revised to--

o   Establish a standard 75-day timeframe for action activities to respond to all
    RODs;

o   Require submission of an ROD for all discrepancies which involve a sealed
    vendor pack;

o   Revise procedures for unresolved or contested reports.

2. PURPOSE.
This instruction:
   a. Supersedes references DLAI 4140.55/SECNAVIST 4355.18/AFR 400.54, Reporting of Supply Discrepancies, 21
Jan 99, (superseded); and DLAR 4140.60/AR 12 –12/SECNAVIST 4355.17A/AFJI 16 –106, Processing Discrepancy
Reports Against Foreign Military Sales Shipments, 17 Dec 91, (cancelled).
   b. Implements DoD 4140.1 –R, DoD Material Management Regulation.
   c. This instruction provides procedures governing the methods and conditions under which shipping (item)          discrep-
ancies and packaging discrepancies, collectively referred to as supply discrepancies, are reported and replies furnished.
For shipments to Security Assistance customers these procedures also include reporting of product quality deficiencies,
including services, and billing errors. The purpose of preparing supply discrepancy reports is to determine the cause      of
discrepancies, effect corrective action, and prevent recurrence. Such reports provide support for adjustment of property
and financial inventory accounting records; information as a basis for claims against contractors; notification             to
shippers; visibility of preservation, packing, marking, and unitization discrepancies; required corrective actions; disposi-
tion instructions; and information for management evaluations. Guidance specific to discrepant Security           Assistance
articles or services is provided in appendix G and reference DoD 5105.38 –M, Security Assistance Management Manual
(SAMM).
   d. Significant Changes. This change modifies multiple areas of SDR guidance as follows.
   (1) Management Evaluation. The management evaluation responsibilities are strengthened to include a semi-
annual reporting requirement and specific report content and measurements.
   (2) Credit Adjustments on SDRs. Additional instruction is provided for SA follow-up on credit adjustments.
   (3) Requests for Reconsideration. The “SDR reply date” which is used as a basis for the submission timeframe for
SA customer requests for reconsideration is clarified as the date of the ILCO reply to the customer following receipt
of disposition from the inventory control point/distribution depot. A timeframe is established for the ILCO to
forward the customer’s request for reconsideration to the responsible action activity. In addition, a timeframe is
established for the ILCO to notify the action activity that extenuating circumstances will necessitate additional time
for the customer or ILCO to complete/process the request. This will allow the action activity to retain applicable
records that might otherwise have been purged during an extensive delay.
   (4) Contested Reconsideration Decisions. A timeframe is specified for ILCO to forward customer’s contested
reconsideration decision to their Service focal point.
   (5) SA Time Standards. Timeframes for actions associated with requests for reconsideration and contested
reconsideration as reflected in this change are summarized as follows in table 1;

3. APPLICABILITY AND SCOPE
   a. This publication is applicable to the Headquarters, Defense Logistics Agency (HQ DLA) and all DLA                    field
activities, Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), other DoD agencies, and the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine
Corps, Coast Guard, and General Services Administration (GSA) activities, shipping and receiving material through the
military or GSA supply and distribution systems. It applies to shipments made from Working Capital Funds                 (WCF)
(formerly Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF)) and non-WCF funded activities, Security Assistance                 shipments
made under the International Logistics Program, personal property shipments, and shipments received from commercial
sources. This document was developed by agreement among the Military Services, DLA, Coast Guard, and GSA.                  This
publication will be implemented by GSA in the Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DoD Shipments, Material,                or
Billings Guide for the above cited purposes.
   b. The reporting of the following types of discrepancies is excluded from the provisions of this publication:
   (1) Shipping discrepancies found while material is in storage with the exception of short shipment and wrong            item
discrepancies discovered upon opening a sealed vendors pack (exception applicable to U.S. Government only).
   (2) Discrepancies involving local base or station deliveries to or return from internal or satellite activities. However,
this exclusion is not applicable to on-site Defense Distribution Depot shipments.
   (3) Discrepancies involving shipments of privately-owned vehicles.
   (4) Discrepancies involving shipments on requisitions or purchase orders from personnel services activities            which
cite nonappropriated funds.
   (5) Transportation discrepancies to the extent covered by DoD 4500.9 –R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part
II, Cargo Movement, except as specifically permitted under Security Assistance procedures.
   (6) Product quality deficiencies to the extent covered by DLAD 4155.24/AR 702             –7/SECNAVIST 4855.5A/AFI
21–115, Product Quality Deficency Report Program, and DLAR 4155.28, Reporting and Processing Medical                    Material
Complaints, except as specifically permitted under Security Assistance procedures.
   (7) Shipping discrepancies involving personal property shipments with the exception of packaging               discrepancies.

4. DEFINITIONS.
See Glossary.

5. PROCEDURES
   a. General.
   (1) SDRs and associated responses may be reported on the SF 364, ROD; by electronic means, to include automated
discrepancy reporting system and electronic data interchange (EDI); customer service help lines; e-mail; or any other
manner acceptable to the submitter and recipient. All manner of reporting must meet the criteria described in            this
document. DoD Components are encouraged to maximize the use of electronic reporting/response with the goal of
paperless processing of supply discrepancies. Refer to DoD 4000.25          –M, Defense Logistics Management System
(DLMS), Vol 2, for use of EDI Transaction Set Implementation Convention 842D, Nonconformance Report (Material
Discrepancies/Deficiencies).
   (2) Shipping or packaging discrepancies attributable to the responsibility of the shipper (including contractors/
manufacturers or vendors) will be reported via SDR by the receiving activity. Transshipment activities noting packag-
ing deficiencies on shipments in transit will prepare an SDR. For multistop shipments/deliveries, each consignee         will
report shipping discrepancies pertaining only to their receipt. When both item discrepancies and packaging discrepan-
cies are noted on the same shipment, both types of discrepancy should be included on the same report. The              report
initiator will indicate on the SDR what action is requested. Typical requested actions are listed by code on the SF      364
and an expanded list is provided at appendix E.
   (3) Multiple requisitions received under a consolidated shipment cannot be combined for reporting purposes.
   (4) Billing, accounting, and financial adjustments for supply discrepancies errors will be processed under DoD
4000.25–7–M, Military Standard Billing System (MILSBILLS) or DLMS, Vol 7, Finance.
   (5) U.S. Government activities returning material are cautioned that the returning activity may be held responsible
for costs incurred by the receiving activity when discrepancies are reported and validated in accordance with            this
publication. This includes returns made in violation of prescribed procedures, returns exhibiting packaging discrepan-
cies, and returns of reparable items unaccompanied by required technical data. Recoupment action by the ICP against
the initiator may include all cost reimbursable actions performed by the receiving activity such as            repackaging,
marking, and disposal.
   (6) The SF 364 or the equivalent electronic SDR will be used to support inventory accounting and                 financial
adjustments. Maintain the SDR (electronic or hard copy) including the action activity response to support formal
adjustment of the DFAS –DE/I, DoD Inventory Control Point/Integrated Material Manager (ICP/IMM), GSA, distribu-
tion depot, and/or consignee accountable inventory and financial accounting records, as appropriate.
   (7) By agreement, contractors receiving GFM will comply with U.S. Government SDR procedures provided herein.
Discrepancies related to GFM which do not meet minimum dollar value criteria below may be reported as a means              of
notifying the shipper/material manager of the discrepant condition.


2                 AR 735–11–2/DLAI 4140.55/SECNAVIST 4355.18A/AFJMAN 23–215 • 6 August 2001
   b. U.S. Government Reporting Criteria. Guidance specific to SA is provided in appendix G and reference DoD
5105.38–M, Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM).
   (1) General.
   (a) Dollar Value: Report shipping discrepant shipments from contractors/manufacturers or vendors regardless              of
dollar value according to the conditions indicated below. Recipients of DLA and GSA directed shipments may report
shipping and packaging discrepancies for action regardless of dollar value at their option.
   (b) SDRs are required when the conditions and dollar value criteria cited below apply. Typical discrepancies are
listed by code on the SF 364 and an expanded list of discrepancies is provided at appendix D.
   (c) Incorrect item SDRs should not be submitted for authorized substitution. DoD Components and GSA will follow
the policy of automatic shipment of an interchangeable item unless the requisition contains an appropriate advice code,
in accordance with DoD 4000.25 –1–M, Military Standard Requisitioning and Issues Procedures (MILSTRIP), appendix
B–15, or DLMS, Vol 2, Supply, limiting the request to a specific item. Similarly, quantities may be adjusted to the unit
pack quantity, when appropriate, unless restricted by the appropriate advice code in the customer requisition. Such
adjustments resulting in quantity variance are not reportable as discrepant.
   (d) An SDR should not be submitted for nonreceipt of shipments made by traceable means, e.g., Government Bill of
Lading (GBL), Commercial Bill of Lading (CBL), unless nonreceipt is for other than a transportation discrepancy, or
for damaged items shipped via modes other than U.S. Postal Service (USPS). Such nonreceipts or damages                     are
reportable as transportation discrepancies reportable under the Joint Regulation referenced above. Also, an SDR should
not be submitted for nonreceipt of shipments made by traceable USPS registered, insured, certified mail                  until
appropriate tracer action has been completed. If tracer action results confirm nonreceipt, then submit an SDR and
include results of the tracer action in Block 12 and attach pertinent documentation. Customers without             automated
access to in-transit visibility information should contact the ICP/depot to determine which shipments are traceable.
   (2) Shipping Discrepancies. The following categories of shipping discrepancies apply. See Glossary for definitions.
   (a) Cancelled Material. An SDR is required when material received is valued in excess of $100 per line item for
canceled requisitions. Confirmation of the cancellation must be on file. Exception: An SDR must be submitted             when
controlled inventory items are received on previously canceled requisitions regardless of dollar value.
   (b) Condition Misrepresented. Report when the condition of an item which exceeds $100 per line item is found to
be other than that shown on the shipping document, or, in the case of subsistence, on supporting               inspection/test
certificates or records.
   (c) Documentation. Report when supply documentation is missing, incomplete, or improperly prepared, regardless of
dollar value.
   (d) Duplicate Shipment. Report duplicate shipments regardless of dollar value.
   (e) Expired Shelf Life. Report receipt of material for which the shelf life has expired regardless of dollar value. Prior
to filing an SDR, access the DoD Quality Status Listing or Materiel Quality Control Storage Standards to determine if
Type II (extendible shelf life) items may be extended. Additionally, reporting activities on GSA-managed items should
contact the Shelf-Life HOTLINE at 1 –209–946–6333, prior to filing an SDR to determine if the expiration date has
been extended.
   (f) Incorrect Item. Report incorrect or misidentified material or unacceptable substitutes regardless of dollar value.
Incorrect item discrepancies discovered while opening a sealed vendor pack will be reported regardless of dollar value
or shipper. These reports must contain the contract number from the packaging and, if available, the lot number and the
original document number. When the original requisition number cannot be identified for discrepancies in sealed
vendor packs the reporting activity must include a constructed document number as described in the Glossary. Where
two separately managed items are involved, e.g., an electronics item was ordered and a construction item was received,
the SDR initiator will forward the report to the shipping depot or manager of item ordered, in accordance                 with
appendix C. It is the responsibility of the SDR receiver to ensure full and appropriate resolution by coordinating with
the other involved ICP or transferring the SDR, so that the initiator receives both financial resolution and material
disposition instructions from the responsible party.)
   (g) Misdirected. Report when material, regardless of value, is improperly addressed and shipped to the wrong
activity.
   (h) Missing Part. Report material received for repair which has been cannibalized or nonexpendable parts or
components (including cannibalization of nonexpendable Basic Issue Item (BII) or a nonexpendable Supply                System
Responsibility Item (SSRI) without the authorization of the inventory manager when the total value of the missing
item(s) exceeds $100). Expendable BII and SSRI are not subject to these procedures.
   (i) Overage/Shortage Report overages or shortages valued in excess of $100 per line item, except                 controlled
inventory items which will be reported regardless of dollar value. Quantity variances on receipts from           procurement
which are authorized by the terms of the contract are not reportable as discrepant. Report shortage or overage due          to
incompatibility of unit of issue between documentation and material received. Shortages/overages discovered             while
opening a sealed vendor pack will be reported regardless of timeframe, dollar value, or shipper. These reports must
contain the contract number from the packaging and, if available, the lot number and the original document            number.
When the original requisition number cannot be identified for discrepancies in sealed vendor packs the reporting


                 AR 735–11–2/DLAI 4140.55/SECNAVIST 4355.18A/AFJMAN 23–215 • 6 August 2001                                  3
activity must include a constructed document number as described in the Glossary. When using a constructed document
number in an SDR, include the fund code and credit-to/bill-to DoDAAC, if different from that in the document
number, to ensure credit or billing is handled appropriately.)
   (j) Technical Data. Report missing and/or incomplete item technical data, e.g., name plate, operating            handbook,
logbook, precautionary markings, warranty data, engineering drawings and associated lists, specifications,            standards
process sheets, manuals, technical reports, and catalog item identifications, and related information, regardless of dollar
value. When reparables are returned and the appropriate historical information/ documentation, operator/maintenance
log books, engine oil analysis, etc., as required by Government regulations and/or technical manuals are not          included,
the receiving activity will submit an SDR regardless of dollar value. Any additional costs incurred by the            repairing
depot/arsenal because of the missing data will be charged to the originating activity.
   (k) Total Nonreceipt. Report nonreceipt of items shipped via traceable means, e.g., GBL or CBL, registered, insured,
certified USPS, or small package carrier shipments only when determined the nonreceipt is not a transportation
discrepancy. U.S. Government customers may not submit an SDR for nonreceipt prior to receipt of a Military Standard
Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) Supply/Shipment Status transaction, or the equivalent under DLMS
2.0. and/or employing Military Standard Transaction and Recording Procedures (MILSTRAP)/DLMS Material Follow-
up procedures.
   (l) U. S. Postal Service. An SDR is required when items valued in excess of $100 per line item, reported shipped by
nontraceable U.S. Postal Service (i.e., not shipped registered, insured, certified mail) are not received or are received in
a damaged condition.
   (m) Unauthorized Customer Returns (Not IMM/ICP-Directed). D i s t r i b u tdi eo pn o tws i l lr e p o rrte c e i po tf u n -
authorized returns to the ICP, regardless of condition of material. The SDR should reflect receipt in condition code          K
when the actual condition cannot be determined. Material returned without its associated technical data will be reported
as indicated under Technical Data, above. Unauthorized returns are subject to recoupment action for disposal                  or
repackaging costs incurred by the distribution depot.
   (n) No Advance Record of Shipment. Retail activities may report receipt of material for which the activity shows no
record of the document number cited in the supply document.
   (o) Lumber. Supply discrepancies related to the receipt of lumber may be reported according to the                   specific
conditions listed for lumber by discrepancy code.
   (p) Repetitive Shipping Discrepancies. Report shipping repetitive discrepancies regardless of dollar value.
   (q) Other Discrepancies. Report other discrepant conditions not described above unless specifically excluded by this
publication.
   (3) Packaging Discrepancies.
   (a) Improper Packaging. Report any unsatisfactory condition resulting from improper packaging which causes                 or
renders the item, shipment, or package to be vulnerable to any loss, delay, or damage according to the specific
conditions cited below. Unless otherwise indicated herein the following minimum dollar value reporting criteria applies
when: (1) the estimated or actual cost of correction exceeds $100 or (2) the value of the item, shipment, or           package
exceeds $2500 (regardless of the cost to correct the packaging discrepancy). This may include loss or damage to the
item, shipment, or package except when a report is otherwise required under DoD 4500.9            –R, Defense Transportation
Regulation, Part II, Cargo Movement. Where encoded information on the discrepancy report is not sufficient, the
submitter should provide detailed descriptions of how the material was packaged, as well as the actual                 damages
incurred to the material.
   (b) Improper Customer Returned Material. Defense Distribution Depots will submit an SDR to the material owner
for packaging discrepancies related to customer returned material or interdepot transfer of material. The material owner
is responsible for funding packaging costs associated with preparing material for storage and reissue.              Packaging
discrepancies occurring in material returns are subject to recoupment action at the discretion of the receiving material
owner. If the packaging is so bad that the item must be forwarded to DRMO, the shipper may be required to            reimburse
the receiver for packing required to effect the shipment and the cost of turning in to DRMO.
   (c) Improper Packing. Report any type of inadequate or improper packing to include incorrect blocking or bracing,
oversized or incorrect container, and inadequate closure, resulting in an unsatisfactory condition or damage.            Report
material shipped without a required reusable container regardless of dollar value.
   (d) Improper Preservation. Report any type of inadequate or improper preservation or physical protection resulting
in an unsatisfactory condition or damage. Report improper preservation of any material identified as being electrostatic/
electromagnetic (ES/EM) sensitive, regardless of the dollar value.
   (e) Improper Markings. Report any omitted, incomplete, illegible, or misplaced markings, packing documentation,
or other identification. Report improper identification of containers or items which requires opening the container or
results in improper storage of the material, regardless of cost.
   (f) Improper Unitization. Improper unitization including inadequate wrapping/strapping or lack of unitization where
appropriate, resulting in an unsatisfactory condition or damage. Report multiple consignees in a single              consignee
consolidation container as improper unitization.
   (g) Mission or Life Endangering. Report packaging discrepancies regardless of dollar value resulting in            damaged


4                AR 735–11–2/DLAI 4140.55/SECNAVIST 4355.18A/AFJMAN 23–215 • 6 August 2001
material which may endanger life, impair combat or deployment operations, or affect other material immediately to the
shipping activity, contracting office, or control point by the quickest communication medium to enable the shipper             to
take immediate corrective action. Submit a formal SDR within 24 hours of the initial report.
   (h) Hazardous Material (includes ammunition and explosives). Report any packaging discrepancy, regardless of
dollar value, if a potentially hazardous condition could result or if damage or an unsatisfactory condition has         occurred
involving any hazardous material. This includes improper identification marking of items and packaging and/or of
unitized loads.
   (i) Excessive Packaging. Report excessive packaging by contractors resulting in additional costs to the Government,
regardless of dollar value.
   (j) Personal Property. Report packaging discrepancies involving shipments of personal property not conforming to
specifications. Packaging discrepancy reports on personal property shipments will be prepared at ocean and                 aerial
terminals only.
   (k) Delay or Additional Costs. Report packaging discrepancies resulting in delay or additional packaging costs              at
aerial or water terminals or at consolidation and containerization points (CCPs). The activity responsible for         operating
the terminal or port of embarkation/debarkation will be responsible for the preparation of the discrepancy report             for
shipments moving through the activity.
   (l) Latent Packaging Discrepancies. Prepare a late SDR for material found in storage with latent preservation and
packaging discrepancies. Confine these reports to stocks which constitute a problem resulting from a                   particular
specification, preservation, or packaging method. Reports relative to packaging discrepancies found in storage will be
annotated “not incident to shipment ” in remarks.
   (m) Repetitive Packaging Discrepancies. Report repetitive packaging discrepancies which impose a significant
burden on receiving or transshipment activities. Total costs to correct packaging should be annotated in block 12 of the
SF 364.
   (4) Discrepancies in Material Returns. Continental United States (CONUS) and overseas activities receiving returns
(excess, redistributed, or reparable material, including returns from SA customers) will submit an SDR for            discrepan-
cies as specified above regardless of the condition when the dollar value exceeds $100 per line item. SDRs                    for
discrepant returns from SA customers will be submitted to the appropriate ILCO. EXCEPTIONS:                      Discrepancies
pertaining to controlled inventory items will be reported regardless of dollar value or condition. When material return
shipments between U.S. activities are classified as unserviceable and uneconomically reparable upon receipt,                  the
receiving activity may submit an SDR. Also see specific guidance above for unauthorized returns. For packaging
discrepancies associated with material returns see specific guidance provided for packaging discrepancies.
   (5) Discrepancies in Reutilization and Marketing Shipments. An SDR will be submitted for discrepancies                      as
specified above in shipments to and from Defense Reutilization and Marketing Activities when the dollar value exceeds
$100 per line item. Exception: Defense Reutilization and Marketing Activities will submit an SDR for shortages                 or
overages in shipments of controlled inventory items regardless of dollar value.
   c. SDR Distribution and Supporting Documentation. (Not Applicable to SA.) Guidance specific to SA is provided in
appendix G and reference DoD 5105.38 –M, Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM). The SDR initiator will
forward the SDR to the appropriate action activity ( “To” address on the SF 364) and provide distribution copies based
upon the type of SDR and the origin of the shipment as directed in appendix C. Include shipping/billing documents,             as
appropriate. Where access to the electronic SDR and associated supply information is available, hard-copy            documents
will not be mailed unless requested by the action activity. The submitter will provide a copy of the Serious            Incident
Report (SIR), or other component-required report, regarding controlled inventory items believed to be stolen, lost, or
unaccounted for. When available, photographic/pictorial evidence of the discrepancy should also be provided. The
action activity will initiate resolution of the SDR, i.e., validating and investigating the discrepancy according to         this
instruction. Responsibility may be transferred or action coordinated with another organization in order to             complete
SDR processing, e.g., request financial adjustments or determine material disposition. The action activity identified by
the initiator will coordinate, as needed, with the owner/manager or other party to obtain resolution. Where available, an
automated discrepancy reporting system will be used to facilitate this process. Where the initiator has misidentified the
action activity, the receiving activity will forward the SDR to the appropriate action activity and notify the submitter of
this action. Appendix C provides in-the-clear address and communications information for many specific locations such
as the GSA National Customer Service Center, and DLA ICPs.
   d. Action Activity Response to an SDR.
   (1) Disposition. The reverse side of the SF 364 or electronic/automated response will be used to provide informative
data to the initiator and as an action reply for discrepant conditions. For Service ICP directed shipments, the ICP is
responsible for providing an SDR reply to the submitter, except as such responsibility has been specifically           delegated
to the shipping depot by the ICP. If acceptable to the U.S. Government submitter only, a verbal response is considered
adequate when supported by an automated discrepancy reporting system. The response will indicate the                appropriate
disposition, e.g., acknowledgment of the report; disposition of the material for those discrepant conditions           requiring
disposition instructions to the reporting activity, such as, overages or receipt of an incorrect item; validation of the
report with authorization to grant a financial adjustment; instructions for repair; or other types of corrective action. The



                  AR 735–11–2/DLAI 4140.55/SECNAVIST 4355.18A/AFJMAN 23–215 • 6 August 2001                                    5
action activity may cite the appropriate disposition/status code as provided in appendix F or annotate the SF 364           using
the appropriate blocks. The action activity may request credit be authorized for customer-reported packaging discrepan-
cies using the fund cite annotated on the SDR (block 13 of the SF 364) for reimbursement of corrective                 packaging
costs incurred by the initiator. For return of discrepant material, the action activity will direct the submitter to use the
same document number under which the material was originally shipped where possible and for SA only, provide the
Service/Agency transportation account code chargeable to return the discrepant material to the appropriate                   U.S.
Government activity or other designated location. When appropriate, the action activity may direct the submitter to
retain or return an exhibit of the discrepant material. The activity requesting this action will pay for exhibit        shipment
costs. Action activities will furnish DD Form 1348 –1A (Issue Release/Receipt Document) for material to be returned.
A copy of the SDR and DD 1348           –1A should be included with returned material and annotated SDR RETURN.
   (2) Corrective Action for Packaging Discrepancies. Shipping activities will, upon receipt of a packaging                 SDR,
immediately investigate the reported discrepancies and take action to prevent their recurrence. Shipping activities will
prepare statements of corrective action in all cases. Corrective action statements will be included in the SDR          response.
If the reverse side of the SF 364 does not provide adequate space, use continuation sheets. Statements will normally            be
made within the time limits specified for SDR replies and be addressed to the initiator of the report with an information
copy to the appropriate control point. Also, for contractor-originated shipments, investigating activities will furnish an
information copy of the results of their investigation to the responsible procurement activity or commodity           command.
Where access to the electronic SDR and associated investigation is available, hard-copy documents will not be              mailed
unless requested by the receiving activity. Reports of corrective action will not be delayed pending final         determination
of the contracting officer when reimbursement (from the contractor/vendor) is warranted. Final actions will be reported
when completed. When a Contract Administration Office investigating activity finds corrective or preventive action is
outside the scope of contract administration and requires action by the procuring activity, the SDR and the investigation
report will be forwarded to the procuring activity for action, with information provided to the appropriate control         point
and SDR initiator.
   (3) For packaging discrepancies on shipments from GSA shipping activities or directed by GSA from a contractor/
vendor (regardless of dollar value), GSA will investigate and, when appropriate, credit the account cited on submission
of SF 1080 (Voucher for Transfer Between Appropriation and/or Funds) with the corresponding SF 364 or equivalent
SDR as supporting documentation.
   (4) Consignor (shipper) replies on Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE) packaging deficiencies which Defense               Supply
Center Richmond has previously funded for packing, crating, and handling (PC&H), should provide necessary                   docu-
ments/information to transfer or reimburse funds for any required corrective action. Handling for PC&H is based on
specified requirements for IPE in MIL        –HDBK 701, Military Standardization Handbook, Blocking, Bracing,                 and
Skidding of Industrial Plant Equipment, and MIL –STD 107, Military Standard Preparation and Handling of Industrial
Plant Equipment.
   (5) The SDR response may be employed by the action activity to provide disposition to contractors reporting GFM-
related discrepancies.
   e. Time Standards.
   (1) Submission of an SDR. Guidance specific to SA is provided in appendix G and reference DoD                     5105.38–M,
Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM). An SDR will be submitted by receiving activities and/or transship-
ment activities as soon as possible but not later than the time standards listed below. Time limits for reporting of
discrepancies relating to contractor warranties are prescribed in individual warranty clauses and/or contracts.            These
time limits override other time limits specified here. For U.S. customers, time limits do not apply to short shipment and
wrong item discrepancies discovered upon opening a sealed vendor pack. SDRs which do not meet the reporting
criteria or timeframes specified in this guidance and do not present sufficient justification will be denied.
   (a) For shortages or overages in shipments of controlled inventory items arms, arms parts, ammunitions,                    and
explosives: report within 24 hours of discovery.
   (b) All other discrepancies.
   1. CONUS destinations: 90 calendar days from date of shipment.
   2. U.S. Government overseas destinations: 150 calendar days from the date of shipment.
   (c) Late Submission. When circumstances prevent compliance with the above time standards (e.g., response to                   a
tracer action reveals a supposed transportation discrepancy to be a shipping/packaging discrepancy), the reasons for
delay will be annotated or identified by discrepancy code and action activities will honor the discrepancy report.
Reporting activities are required to send SDRs to report a shipping or packaging discrepancy even after the above
submission time standard has elapsed. If lacking justification, action activities will normally use such SDRs in               the
system evaluation and correction process.
   (2) SDR Response Timeframes. Action activities will reply to all SDRs within the following timeframes:
   (a) Thirty calendar days from date of receipt of reports by the action activity when associated with shipments               of
controlled inventory items.
   (b) Thirty calendar days from date of receipt of reports by the action activity (distribution depot) for total nonreceipt
discrepancy reports forwarded by the ILCO for SA customers.


6                 AR 735–11–2/DLAI 4140.55/SECNAVIST 4355.18A/AFJMAN 23–215 • 6 August 2001
   (c) Otherwise, 55 calendar days from date of receipt of report by the action activity.
   f. Followup and Unresolved SDRs.
   (1) Followup on Delinquent SDRs. When an action activity does not reply to an SDR within the prescribed
timeframe, the reporting activity or the ILCO, acting on behalf of the SA customer, will send a follow-up inquiry using
hard-copy or automated means. If there is any change to the point of contact information originally provided, the                                       new
information should be included in the follow-up. If applicable, reporting activities should allow for the mailing time                                    of
the original report before following up on action activities. See apendix B for instructions on preparing a SF                                          364
follow-up inquiry.
   (2) Nonresponses to U.S. Government SDRs. After appropriate follow-up, should the reporting activity still                                            not
receive reply to an SDR as prescribed herein, it will notify and forward a copy of the SDR and                                                supporting
correspondence/information to their Service/Agency SDR processing focal point (or designated activity) for assistance.
Their focal point will notify and forward, if necessary, all the information related to the SDR to the appropriate                                   action
activity for review and appropriate disposition. When the discrepancy involves another Service/Agency, the                                       reporting
activity will send the appropriate data to their focal point, who will coordinate with the focal point of the other Service/
Agency to attain a response from the appropriate action activity. The action activity will provide a response to the
reporting activity, with information copy(s) to all concerned, within 45 calendar days from the date of notification.
   g. Contested Reports.
   (1) When a U.S. Government reporting activity does not concur with a reply/disposition received in response to an
SDR, it will notify and forward, if necessary, a copy of the report and all supporting correspondence/documentation,
identifying the points of conflict or concern, to their Service/Agency SDR processing focal point office for assistance.
When the discrepancy involves another Service/Agency, the focal point will review all data/documentation and, if the
appeal is valid, will forward it on to the responsible Service/Agency designated focal point office. The                               aforementioned
activity will review all data relating to the problem and provide a response to the reporting activity with information to
all concerned parties. The decision will be rendered within 45 calendar days from the date of focal point                                   correspond-
ence is received. This decision will be final.
   (2) Security Assistance Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Reconsideration Decisions. Guidance specific to
SA is provided in appendix G.
   (3) The DoD ICP/IMM or GSA will review all correspondence/information relating to the SDR, initiate any required
a c t i o na ,n d r e p l yt o t h e I L C Ow i t h i 6n 0 c a l e n d da ar y sf r o mt h e d a t et he a c t i o an c t i v i rt ey c e i v te hs e I L C O
correspondence.
   h. Invalid/Incorrect Reports. When an SDR is later discovered to be invalid, it will be cancelled or corrected using
hard-copy or automated means. Forward cancellations and corrections to the same distribution list as the initial SDR.
See appendix B instructions for the preparing SF 364 cancellation and correction.
   i. Transfers of Item Management Responsibilities. Under the Logistics Reassignment Program (LRP), item manage-
ment responsibility for an item may have been transferred to another component after the date of shipment. In these
instances, a single discrepancy reported on a requisition line item may require action and/or reply from two different
components. For example, the component that billed the item, the losing item manager (LIM), is the activity that                                       must
provide billing adjustment, when appropriate, and another component, the gaining item manager (GIM), would be
responsible for the investigation of problem items, providing disposition instructions and directing reshipments.                                       The
SDR initiator or ILCO acting on behalf of the SA customer, will identify the action party (                            “To” address) based upon
the origin of the shipment as indicated in appendix C without regard for the LR. It will be the responsibility of                                        the
shipping depot or LIM to coordinate with the GIM for an appropriate response/disposition to the submitter.
   j. Credit Adjustments on SDRs.
   (1) When an action activity has indicated that a credit adjustment has been authorized, reimbursement is normally
provided to the fund code and bill-to address cited on the original requisition. When concerned about an                                          apparent
nonreceipt of credit, the SDR submitter should consult with his bill-to finance office for verification. Allow a minimum
of 60 days from the date of the SDR response before initiating a follow-up action.
   (2) When nonreceipt of credit is confirmed, the financial office will submit a request for billing adjustment                                          as
prescribed by MILSBILLS (Document Identifier Code FAE and billing advice code 26) or the DLMS, Vol 7, Finance.

6. MANAGEMENT EVALUATION
   a. The supply discrepancy reporting program is designed to promote evaluation, correction, and improvement of
logistics operations. To accomplish this objective, discrepancies as specified in this publication must be reported and
investigated in accordance with established policies and procedures. DoD Components will institute SDR quality
programs that will include periodic reviews to assess the accuracy and quality of work processes applicable to supply
discrepancy processing. In addition, Components will require, as a minimum, semi-annual summary reporting to an
appropriate headquarters for review and analysis. Components unable to support the full scope of the required data
collection under legacy systems will incorporate this reporting requirement under business system modernization
efforts. Data collected must be sufficient to enable monitoring activities to:
   (1) Identify trends



                     AR 735–11–2/DLAI 4140.55/SECNAVIST 4355.18A/AFJMAN 23–215 • 6 August 2001                                                           7
   (2) Establish volume and dollar values of SDRs
   (3) Bring management attention to problems with shipping activities as necessary
   (4) Prevent recurrence of discrepancies
   b. As a minimum, the IMM/ICP and shipping activities must have visibility of detail/summary reports that reflect:
   (1) The number of SDRs received during a particular timeframe by shipping activity, dollar value, and discrep-
ancy type. Reports will measure compliance with SDR submission timeframes.
   (2) The number of SDRs responses processed during a particular timeframe by action activity, dollar value, and
discrepancy type. Reports will reflect a breakdown of SDR actions taken to include dollar value of credit authorized
and reshipped material. Reports will measure compliance with SDR processing timeframes and reflect age of
ongoing investigations.
   c. As a minimum, the U.S. Government receiving activity must have visibility of detail/summary reports that
reflect:
   (1) The number of SDRs prepared during a particular timeframe by shipping activity, dollar value, and discrep-
ancy type. Reports will measure compliance with SDR submission and followup timeframes.
   (2) Responses received from the responsible action activity, and dollar values recovered, either in the form of
reshipped materiel or credit received.

7. RESPONSIBILITIES
   a. The Director, Defense Logistics Management Standards Office (DLMSO) will:
   (1) Serve as the DoD central point of contact.
   (2) Sponsor publication of this instruction, for the centralized receipt of proposals, and for the              development,
maintenance, and processing of changes to the publication in coordination with the participating Military Services,
DoD agencies, and GSA.

as final review authority for their respective Service/Agency on unresolved or contested reports, unless otherwise
indicated by the Service/Agency.
   (2) Coordinate inquiries received from field activities, with applicable principal Service/Agency staff elements and,
as required, with other Service/Agency counterparts.
   (3) Evaluate all suggested changes and additions to this instruction originating within their respective Service/
Agency. Suggestions will be evaluated initially by the focal point. If suggestions are received by DLMSO directly             for
evaluation, they will be forwarded to the appropriate Military Service/Agency focal point for review and evaluation.            If
the suggestion is considered worthy of adoption, the focal point will submit an official change proposal,             stipulating
specific narrative changes to the publication. Such proposed changes will be coordinated in the normal manner, with
awards determined by the focal points, under existing procedures.
   (4) Develop and submit official change proposals to DLMSO with justification and expected benefits.
   (5) Develop and submit to DLMSO a single, coordinated Service/Agency position on all system change                  proposals

Table B–1
Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) (also referred to as Reports of Discrepancy (RODs))—Instructions
Item 1       Date of Preparation. Use month, day, and four-position year format.

Item 2       Report Number. Provide the locally assigned report number. For Security Assistance shipments, this consists of one al-
             pha character to identify the initiating office in-country, four numeric characters for number control, two alpha characters
             for the foreign customer country and three to six alphanumeric characters for the master and line item case designator,
             i.e., A0010–JA–KBD/001. For any unnumbered reports received, the ILCO will assign number x9000 to x9999 and so ad-
             vise the foreign country customer on the receipted copy. Suffix code R added to the report number indicates the pur-
             chaser has asked for reconsideration of the report disposition. Suffix code C added to the report number indicates that the
             purchaser has contested the U.S. Government’s decision on a request for reconsideration.

Item 3       To. In-the-clear name, address, ZIP code and DoD Activity Address Code (DoDAAC) and/or Routing Identifier Code (RIC)
             (if assigned), and attention symbol/code of action activity. The action activity is based upon the origin of the shipment as
             indicated in appendix C. If forwarding to the ICP, the RIC of the ICP is located in positions 67–69 of the DD Form
             1348–1A. If forwarding to the Defense Distribution Depot, the RIC of the shipping depot is located in positions 4–6. When
             both shipping and packaging discrepancies are reported for the same item, enter “see item 15” and enter addresses/
             codes of both activities in item 15.
             For Security Assistance discrepancy reports, refer to appendix G for ILCO addresses.

Item 4       From. DoDAAC and/or RIC (if assigned), name, address and ZIP code of the reporting activity or Security Assistance cus-
             tomer (consignee). The in-the-clear address will be entered.

Item 5a      Shipper’s Name. Enter name, DoDAAC and/or RIC (for DoD activities) or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE)
             Code (if available, for commercial contractor facilities), and address of shipper (consignor) when different from item 3. If
             applicable, the RIC of the shipping depot is located in positions 4–6 of the DD Form 1348–1A.

Item 5b      Number and Date of Invoice. Enter number and date of vendor’s invoice or shipper’s bill number. Attach copy of invoice to
             SF 364. (Not applicable to packaging discrepancies.)

Item 6       Transportation Document. Enter the type of transportation document, GBL, CBL, manifest, waybill, insured/certified U.S.
             Postal Service, or transportation control and movement document (TCMD) and the identifying number assigned to such
             document. This is a mandatory entry when shipment received was made via traceable means, e.g., GBL, CBL. Further for
             U.S. SDRs, for discrepancies involving shortages, include following statement in item 12—“Shortage has been verified as
             not being transportation related.”

Item 7a      Shipper’s Number. Enter shipment number (when more than one shipment is made under a contract or requisition) and
             contract/contract line item number/document number (e.g., contract, purchase order). For SA, also include the shipment
             date to distinguish multiple shipments from a contractor source.

Item 7b      Office Administering Contract. Name, address, and ZIP code of the Contract Administration Office. (CAO activity which di-
             rected/arranged shipment.)

Item 8       Requisitioner’s Number. Enter the requisitioning activity’s number, e.g., requisition, purchase request, and suffix code, if
             applicable. Entry of the applicable requisition document number is mandatory in all instances, even though a contract/pur-
             chase order is involved. Only one document number will be included on each SF 364. For U.S. SDRs only, when the orig-
             inal requisition number cannot be identified for discrepancies in sealed vendor packs, the reporting activity must include a
             constructed document number as defined in the Glossary. When using a constructed document number in an SDR, use
             block 13 to cite the fund code and bill-to/credit-to DoDAAC, if different from that in the document number.

Item 9a      NSN/Part Number and Nomenclature. If item received is different from item shown on shipping documents, or different
             from item ordered, show each item on a separate line. For serial numbered principal items, sets, kits and outfits, list the
             item individual serial number first, followed by the discrepancies applicable to that serial number. (NOTE: Sets, kits and
             outfits showing an assembly order number, the assembly order number should also be listed.)

Item 9b      Unit of Issue. Enter unit of issue as billed or indicated on shipping document for each item listed in item 9a. (Not applica-
             ble to packaging discrepancies.)

TYPICAL SHIPPING AND PACKAGING DISCREPANCIES LISTED BY DISCREPANCY CODE

single report. Preprinted codes on the face of the SF 364 may be supplemented from this list of codes. These codes     are
authorized for use in all formats of SDR reporting. Use of the expanded list of codes is encouraged to clearly    identify
the discrepant situation and reduce the need for narrative descriptions.

Appendix G
Security Assistance Guidance
G–1. PURPOSE
  a. The purpose of this appendix is to provide specific procedural guidance relevant to the processing of Security
Assistance (SA) Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) (formerly referred to as Reports of Discrepancy (RODs)).          Based
upon United States of America Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) agreements, SA customers will use SDRs to
report all supply, billing, and product quality discrepancies associated with SA shipments. International       Logistics
Control Offices (ILCOs) should also refer to reference DoD 5105.38          –M, Security Assistance Management Manual
(SAMM) of the basic instruction for overall policy related to SA.
  b. This appendix provides information previously contained in DLAR 4140.60/AR 12 –12/SECNAVINST 4355.17A/
AFR 67 –7, Processing Discrepancy Reports Against Foreign Military Sales Shipments.

G–2. PROCEDURES
   a. Typical discrepancies are listed by code on the SF 364 and an expanded list of discrepancies is provided at
appendix D. The Glossary provides definitions. Additional guidance for SA-unique discrepancies follows.
   (1) Product Quality (Item) Deficiencies. The SA customer must provide evidence that a receipt inspection was
performed and the defect could not be detected at that time and that the defect is present for reasons other than
deterioration or damage incurred during storage or handling. Quality deficiencies include deficiencies in          design,
specification material, manufacture, and workmanship. The submitter may identify latent defects and quality       deficien-
cies which result in a safety hazard. A detailed description of the complaint may be provided if needed to supplement
discrepancy codes. In addition provide photographs, test data, and related documentation, if available.
   (2) Billing Discrepancies. In accordance with DoD 4000.25 –7–M, Military Standard Billing System (MILSBILLS)
or the DLMS, Vol 7, Finance, billing discrepancies will be converted to MILSBILLS Document Identifier                 FAE
Transactions and submitted to the billing office.
   (3) Financial Discrepancies (Administrative and Accessorial). These discrepancies will be forwarded to the Defense
Finance and Accounting Service – Denver, Deputate for Security Assistance (DFAS              –DE/I) (formerly SAAC) for
processing.
   b. All SA SDRs will be submitted directly to the ILCO identified below for initial screening and processing in
accordance with this publication and reference reference DoD 5105.38 –M, Security Assistance Management Manual
(SAMM). SDRs may be forwarded via SF 364, Report of Discrepancy, or authorized electronic/automated               formats.
   (1) Army
Commander, U.S. Army Security Assistance Command
54 M Avenue, Suite 1
New Cumberland, PA 17070 –5096

  (2) Navy
Commanding Officer, Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP)
ATTN: Code P753112
700 Robbins Avenue, Building 4B
Philadelphia, PA 19111 –5095

  (3) Air Force
Air Force Security Assistance Center
5490 Pearson Road
Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 –5332

   c. As appropriate, SDRs will be forwarded for further processing to DoD ICP/IMM, shipping depot, or GSA. Total
nonreceipt SDRs will normally be forwarded directly to the shipping depot. All responses to discrepancy reports will
be returned to the ILCO.
   d. ICP/IMM or depot action activities will ensure the reverse side of the original SF 364 is fully completed and the
original copy of the report returned to the ILCO bearing the original signature of the individual responsible for
preparation of the reply. Authorized electronic/automated format equivalent to the SF 364 may also be used to include,
at a minimum, the requisition document number, the report number (item 2 of the SF 364), point of contact,               and
pertinent information from the data blocks on the reverse side of the SF 364 or the expanded code lists found             in
appendixes D, E, and F of this instruction.
   e. Whenever materiel is directed for return to U.S. custody, the purchasing country will be instructed to reship the
materiel using the same document number under which the materiel was originally shipped. The country will                 be
advised that they must return the material to U.S. Government custody within 180 days from date of                 approval/
instructions. In those instances when materiel is to be returned to the United States at U.S. Government expense,      every



                 AR 735–11–2/DLAI 4140.55/SECNAVIST 4355.18A/AFJMAN 23–215 • 6 August 2001                               33
effort will be made to utilize the Defense Transportation System (DTS) for the return movement. Provide the           Service/
Agency transportation account code chargeable to return the discrepant material to the appropriate U.S. Government
activity or other designated location. When appropriate the action activity may direct the submitter to return an       exhibit
of the discrepant material. The activity requesting this action will pay for exhibit shipment costs. Action activities will
furnish DD Form 1348 –1A for material to be returned. A copy of the SDR and DD Form 1348 –1A should be included
with returned material and annotated as an SDR RETURN. Upon evidence of material being returned, a                       credit
adjustment will be processed for the return of the discrepant material if previously authorized. This evidence         releases
the SA customer of liability for the material.
   f. SA materiel not returned to the stocks of DoD or GSA, or retained or disposed of by the foreign government               at
the direction of the applicable ILCO, will be turned in to the nearest U.S. accountable military activity (regardless         of
Military Service responsible for the materiel). This publication will be authority for a turn-in and the material will be
processed in accordance with U.S. procedures.
   g. The shipping activity will retain paper copy of the SA shipping documentation (signed carrier            ’s receipt and
shipping document) at the shipping site for a period of 2 years following the shipping date. After this point, the        paper
records will be retired to the appropriate Federal Records Center for a period of 28 years. The stored records must be
segregated by country and the container marked accordingly. Billing documentation will be retained by the Military
Departments and DoD agencies as specified in MILSBILLS and DoD 7000.14                 –R, Vol. 15, Department of Defense
Financial Management Regulation (Security Assistance Policy and Procedures).
   h. Incorrect item SDRs are not permitted for authorized substitution, unless the substitute item does not meet            fit,
form, or function standards. DoD Components and GSA follow the policy of automatic shipment of an interchangeable
item unless the requisition contains an appropriate advice code, in accordance with DoD 4000.25              –1–M, Military
Standard Requisitioning and Issues Procedures (MILSTRIP), appendix B –15, or DoD 4000.25 –M, Defense Logistics
Management System (DLMS), Vol 2, Supply, limiting the request to a specific item. Similarly, quantities may be
adjusted to the unit pack quantity, when appropriate, unless restricted by the appropriate advice code in the        customer
requisition. Such adjustments resulting in quantity variance are not reportable as discrepant.
   i. When an SDR is initiated for nonreceipt, the SA customer is required to provide documentation from the freight
forwarder indicating that no material has been received on the requisition and transportation control numbers               that
apply. The ILCO will deny any nonreceipt SDRs received that do not have this documentation attached. The ILCO will
return these SDRs to the customer as incomplete.
   j. The report initiator will indicate on the SDR what action is requested. Typical requested actions are listed by code
on the SF 364 and an expanded list is provided at appendix E of this instruction.
   k. Time Standards
   (1) SDR preparation and submission time by the SA customer will be limited to the provisions of the LOA as
explained in reference DoD 5105.38 –M, Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM).
   (2) ILCOs are permitted 15 calendar days from the time of receipt for processing discrepancy reports prior to
forwarding to the appropriate ICP/IMM, shipping depot, or GSA action activity and again upon return from the             action
activity. Upon return of the SDR response from the action activity, ILCOs are permitted 15 calendar days for
processing and forwarding to the SA customer.
   (3) Response time frames for the action activity are as specified in the basic instruction.
   l. Followup and Unresolved SDRs. See basic instruction.
   m. Invalid/Incorrect SDRs. See basic instruction.
   n. Requests for Reconsideration. The SA customer may ask the U.S. Government to reconsider the final status               for
an SDR. Customers must send written requests, to reach the ILCO within 90 calendar days from the date            of the ILCO
reply to the customer concerning disposition as provided by the responsible action activity. When the customer asks
for reconsideration, the ILCO will add a suffix code R to the SDR number (item 2, SF 364). The ILCO will add                  its
comments and send the SDR, together with all applicable correspondence/information, to the appropriate DoD                 ICP/
IMM or GSA action activity for reconsideration within 30 days of receiving the request for reconsideration from the
customer. The action activity will review to determine if the request should be honored, initiate any required          action,
and reply to the ILCO within 60 calendar days from the date of the ILCO correspondence. ILCOs will notify the ICP/
IMM or GSA when extenuating circumstances require additional processing time beyond the 120 days allowed for
submission and ILCO research. This will allow the ICP to retain applicable documentation for SDR resolution.
   o. Contested Reconsideration Decisions. SA customers may contest the DoD ICP/IMM or GSA decision on                          a
request for reconsideration. To do so, the customer must send written request to reach the ILCO within 90             calendar
days from the date of the ILCO reply to the request for reconsideration. The customer must explain why the DoD             ICP/
IMM or GSA decision is not satisfactory. When the customer contests a DoD ICP/IMM or GSA decision, the ILCO
will add a suffix code C to the SDR report number. The suffix code will be used in all references to the SDR. The
SDR and all supporting documentation will be forwarded by letter          within 15 calendar days to the ILCO ’s Military
Service/Agency focal point who will review all the information relating to the problem, see that any needed action             is
taken, and send the ILCO the final decision within 60 calendar days from the date of the ILCO correspondence. Copies

of all information/ documentation relating to the request shall be included with all correspondence exchanged  between
the parties involved.
   p. Transfer of Item Management Responsibilities. See basic instruction.
   q. Credit Adjustments on SDRs.
   (1) When an action activity has indicated that a credit adjustment has been authorized, reimbursement is
normally provided to the fund code and bill-to address cited on the original requisition. When concerned about an
apparent nonreceipt of credit, the ILCO should consult with the appropriate finance office for verification. Allow a
minimum of 60 days from the date of the SDR response before initiating a follow-up action. To facilitate research of
supply and financial records, it is suggested that follow-up action for nonreceipt of credit associated with the return
of discrepant material occur within a reasonable period (e.g., not longer than 45 days after the ILCO provides the
action activity the initial notice with evidence of discrepant material return).
   (2) When nonreceipt of credit is confirmed, the ILCO will submit a request for billing adjustment as prescribed
by MILSBILLS (Document Identifier Code FAE and billing advice code 26) or the DLMS, Vol 7, Finance. Do not
send a hardcopy of the SDR or reply, as this may create duplicate work for the finance centers and may cause
improper processing of your request.
   r. Management Evaluation. General guidance is provided in the basic instruction at paragraph F.1. Components
unable to support the full scope of the required data collection under legacy systems will incorporate this reporting
requirement under business system modernization efforts. As a minimum, the ILCO must have visibility of detail/
summary reports that reflect:
   (1) The number of SDRs received during a particular timeframe by customer with breakdown by shipping activity
reflecting dollar value and discrepancy type. Reports will measure customer compliance with SDR submission
timeframes and ILCO compliance with SDR processing timeframes.
   (2) Reports will reflect a breakdown of SDR action activity response reflecting actions taken to include dollar
value of credit authorized and reshipped material.

G–3. RESPONSIBILITIES
   a. The ILCO will:
   (1) Complete initial SDR screening in accordance with this instruction and reference DoD 5105.38            –M, Security
Assistance Management Manual (SAMM).
   (2) Reject discrepancy reports which do not contain required data, unless such data is readily available, at the ILCO.
   (3) Reject duplicate SDRs, except those which are resubmitted to contest a previous decision.
   (4) Review all requests for reconsideration which contest the decision on such requests. Reject those requests which
lack sufficient justification or which were not received within the established time standards in this appendix.
   (5) Review all SDRs received for processing and determine proper course of action based on available case history
data.
   (6) Process to the SA customer initial acknowledgment of receipt of SDR replies and/or denials.
   (7) Forward SDRs to the appropriate ICP/IMM, shipping depot, or GSA action activity.
   (8) Report the disposition of SDRs applicable to materiel and services to the DFAS        –DE/I as required in the DoD
7000.14–R, Vol 15.
   b. The DoD ICP/IMM, shipping depot, or GSA will:
   (1) Review all SDRs received for processing and determine proper course of action based on available              supply
records and the results of investigation.
   (2) Furnish properly completed SDRs to the ILCO for further processing to the SA customer. The action activity
may cite the appropriate disposition/status code as provided in appendix F or annotate the SF 364 using the appropriate
blocks.
   (3) Based upon validated SDR, request that DFAS authorize adjustment/credit in accordance with MILSBILLS.
   (4) Provide disposition instructions to the ILCO as required.
   (5) Provide signed evidence of shipment (see definition in the Glossary) to the ILCO when nonreceipt of materiel is
involved. If this documentation cannot be provided, appropriate credit is required.
   (6) Provide documentation which is matched to the quantity shipped for concealed shortages. Examples of             such
documentation are those which contain size, total weight, and cube accepted by the carrier. Credit is denied if         the
documentation, in conjunction with the unit weight, supports shipment of the total quantity billed. Otherwise, appropri-
ate credit for the difference is required.

Section II
Terms

Action Activity.
Any activity required to take action as a result of an SDR (ROD), e.g., distribution depot, inventory control point/
integrated material manager (ICP/IMM), contract administration office, packaging control point, International Logistics
Control Office (ILCO), or a shipping activity.

Basic Issue Item (BII).
Those essential auxiliary items that are required to operate the equipment and to enable it to perform the mission and
function for which it was designed or intended.

Billing Discrepancy.
The following definition applies to Security Assistance discrepancy reporting only: A discrepancy related to duplicate
or multiple billing per individual shipment or a single billing with no ship line. Such billing discrepancies                                      are
reportable to the ILCO on a SDR (ROD) by Security Assistance customers. Price verification or challenges are                                      not
r e p o r t a bo lne a n S D R .W i t h i U
                                          n . S .G o v e r n m ec nh ta n n e lt sh,e b i l l i ndgis c r e p a n cwi ei lslb e p r o c e s s ue nd d e r
MILSBILLS. This means the ILCO will convert the discrepancy to a MILSBILLS FAE Transaction.

Constructed Document Number.
A number created by a U.S. Government SDR initiator to be used as a pseudo-requisition number when the               original
number cannot be determined. This is used only to report incorrect item and shipment quantity discrepancies discov-
ered upon opening a sealed vendor pack and is not applicable to Security Assistance purchasers. It is essential that      the
original contract number be reflected on the SDR to expedite ICP/IMM/depot research. The 14-position            constructed
document number will contain the reporting activity ’s Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC) as
the first 6 positions, followed by the current date (YDDD), and a serial number beginning with U as the last                4
positions. When using a constructed document number in an SDR, include fund code and credit-to/bill-to DoDAAC,              if
different from the document number DoDAAC. Under DLMS, the U in the serial number is reported separately as                  a
Utilization Code.

Controlled Inventory Items.
Those items designated as having characteristics which require that they be identified, accounted for,            secured,
segregated, or handled in a special manner to ensure their safeguard or integrity. Controlled inventory items in
descending order of degree of control normally exercised are:
   a. Classified Items. Material which requires protection in the interest of national security IAW DoD 5200.1          –R,
Information Security Program.
   b. Sensitive Items. Material which requires a high degree of protection and control due to statutory requirements     or
regulations, such as narcotics and drug abuse items; precious metals; items which are of a high value, highly technical,
or hazardous nature; and small arms, ammunition, explosives, and demolition Material.
   c. Pilferable Items. Material having a ready resale value or application to personal possession and which is,
therefore, especially subject to theft.

Damage.
(Applicable to U.S. Postal Service and SA shipments only.) Partial or total marring of the appearance or usability                                 of
the materiel for its intended purpose. For Security Assistance a condition creating impaired item functionality.

Defense Logistics Management System (DLMS).
A system governing logistics functional business management standards and practices to include management         policy,
responsibilities, procedures, rules, and electronic data communication standards. These standards support the DoD in
the conduct of logistics operations in the areas of supply (to include discrepancy reporting), transportation,   contract
administration, and finance. The DLMS is not an automated information system, rather it provides an infrastructure for

the participative establishment and maintenance of procedural guidance to implement the Department ’s logistics policy
by its user community. For additional information refer to the DoD 4000.25      –M, DLMS.

Duplicate Shipment.
A shipment which corresponds exactly to a previous shipment.

Evidence of Shipment.
Any legible movement document or receipt, duly signed by a carrier representative, which shows the shipping activity
has shipped or released the material in question to a carrier for shipment. Such documents generally show the        quantity,
NSN, mode of shipment, date of shipment, TCN, notice of availability number/bill of lading/parcel post                insured,
registered, or certified number, addresses, vessel, or flight number (to the extent possible), name of shipper, carrier,    to
include weight and cube information and number of pieces, etc.

Financial Discrepancy.
The following definition applies to Security Assistance discrepancy reporting only: A discrepancy related to adminis-
trative and/or accessorial charges. These discrepancies will be processed by the Defense Finance and          Accounting
Service – Denver, Deputate for Security Assistance (DFAS –DE/I).

Foreign Military Sales (FMS).
That portion of U.S. Security Assistance authorized by the Arms Export Control Act, as amended, and conducted              on
the basis of formal contracts or agreements between the United States Government and an authorized recipient
government or international organization.

Grant Aid (Military Assistance Program).
That portion of Security Assistance rendered under the authority of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1968, as          amended,
which provides defense articles and services to recipients on a nonreimbursable (grant) basis.

Hazardous Material (includes ammunition and explosives)(DOT definition).
A substance or material which has been determined by the Secretary of Transportation to be capable of posing an
unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property when transported in commerce, and which has been so        designated.

Incorrect Item.
An item received in lieu of the item requisitioned. This is an erroneous item shipped due to shipper error and not an
intended interchangeable/substitute item. Also referred to as wrong item.

Interchangeable Item.
Interchangeability is a condition which exists when two or more items possess such functional and physical characteris-
tics as to be equivalent in performance and durability and are capable of being exchanged one for the other    without
alteration of the items themselves or of adjoining items, except for adjustment, and without selection for fit     and
performance. It includes capability of two or more items or components of equipment to replace each other in          a
physical or functional environment with negligible modification or loss of efficiency.

International Logistics Control Office (ILCO).
The organization in the Military Departments which administers the Security Assistance programs. The ILCOs for     the
Army, Navy, and Air Force, respectively, are the U.S. Army Security Assistance Command, New Cumberland, PA; the
Naval Inventory Control Point, Philadelphia, PA; and the Air Force Security Assistance Center, Wright-Patterson AFB,
OH.

Item Deficiency.
See SF 368 (Product Quality Deficiency Report).

Latent Defect.
This definition is provided for supply discrepancy reporting of product quality deficiencies against Security Assistance
shipments. A latent defect is defined as a deficiency in an article which effects the operability and is not normally
detected by examination or routine test, but which was present at time of manufacture. Receipt inspection does not
necessitate initial operation or extensive testing, disassembly, or other extraordinary receipt inspection.

Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA).
The U.S. document by which the U.S. Government offers to sell to a foreign government or international           organization




                 AR 735–11–2/DLAI 4140.55/SECNAVIST 4355.18A/AFJMAN 23–215 • 6 August 2001                                 37
defense articles and defense services. The LOA lists the items and/or services, estimated costs, the terms and    conditions
of sale, and provides for the foreign government     ’s signature to indicate acceptance.

Misdirected Materiel.
Materiel is improperly addressed and/or shipped to the wrong destination. Properly addressed material which                is
incorrectly shipped to the wrong activity while under U.S. Government-controlled transportation is a transportation
discrepancy reportable under DoD 4500.9 –R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part II, Cargo Movement.

Misidentified Item.
When the label on the container is different than the item in the container, or tag attached to the item (also           see
Incorrect Item).

Overage
   a. Item overage is when the quantity received is greater than shown on shipping document. This type of overage          is
not evident on delivery but is discovered when the article of freight, as described on the transportation document,        is
opened and the contents are checked. This includes overages found in a SEAVAN/container that is source loaded and
moves under a shipper ’s load and count, and arrives at destination with original seal(s) intact. The Defense Personnel
Support Center uses the average net weight lotting system when shipping perishable specification freeze and chill
items. Actual weight received may differ from the supply documentation. If the number of cases/containers           received
agree with number shown on supply documentation, the actual weight received is within weight range variation;             an
SDR will not be submitted for an overage.

Packaging Discrepancy.
Any unsatisfactory condition due to improper or inadequate packaging (including preservation, packing, marking,      or
unitization) and which causes the item, shipment, or package to be vulnerable to loss, delay, or damage, or unnecessary
expense to the U.S. Government, as in excessive packaging.

Personal Property.
(Applicable to Packaging Discrepancies Only – Not Applicable to SA) Includes household goods and unaccompanied
baggage defined as follows:

Product Quality (Item) Deficiency.
A defect or nonconforming condition which limits or prohibits the product from fulfilling its intended purpose.
Included are deficiencies in design, specification, material, manufacturing, and workmanship. Reportable as an             item
deficiency on an SDR by SA customers only.

Proof of Delivery (Defense Transportation Regulation definition).
A legible date and signature of the designated receiver listed on the delivery manifest, certifying the item was received.
Proof of delivery must also reflect the number of cases/containers received to agree with number shown on          supply
documentation and actual weight received within weight-range variation. The proof of delivery establishes transfer of
custody and liability to the receiver. In the case of nonreceipt SDRs, the DoD ICP/IMM/shipping depot and GSA          are
required only to provide evidence of shipment.

Report of Discrepancy (ROD).
See Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR).

Security Assistance.
A group of programs, including Grant Aid and FMS, authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as                   amended
and the Arms Export Control Act, as amended, or other related statutes by which the United States provides defense
articles, military training, and other defense related services, by grant, credit, cash sale, lease, or loan, in furtherance  of
national policies and objectives.

Shelf Life.
The total period of time beginning with the date of manufacture, cure, assembly, or pack that an item may remain        in
the combined wholesale (including manufacture) and retail storage system and still remain suitable for issue and/or use
by the end user. Shelf life is not to be confused with service-life, which is a measurement of anticipated average or
mean life of an item; an SDR cannot be submitted for service-life.

Shelf-Life Item.
An item of supply having deteriorative or unstable characteristics to a degree that a storage time period must be
assigned to ensure that it will perform satisfactorily in service. See DoD 4140.27 –M, Shelf-Life Management Program,
for details.

Shipment.
The movement of material from point of origin to destination by any mode.

Shipper.
Any organization/activity that furnishes/delivers material to a carrier for movement. The shipper may be a             military
organization or activity, other Government agency, or a manufacturer or vendor.

Shipping (Item) Discrepancy.
Any variation in quantity or condition of material received from that shown on the covering authorized        shipping
documents, e.g., DD Form 1348 –1A, or purchase order. This includes incorrect and misdirected material, receipt     of
canceled requirements, improper, inadequate technical or supply documentation, or other discrepancies as   enumerated
in this instruction and not the result of a transportation error or product quality deficiency.

Shortage.
   a. Item shortage is when the quantity received is less than the quantity shown on the shipping document. Shortage is
not evident on delivery but is discovered when the article of freight, as described on the transportation document,          is
opened and the contents are checked. This includes shortage found in a SEAVAN/container that is source loaded and
moves under shipper ’s load and count, and arrives at destination with original seal(s) intact. The Defense        Personnel
Support Center uses the average net weight lotting system when shipping perishable specification freeze and chill
items. Actual weight received may differ from supply documentation. If the number of cases/containers received          agree
with number shown on supply documentation, and actual weight received is within weight range variation, an SDR will
not be submitted for a shortage.
   b. Transportation shortages as described below are reportable for SA customers only under this publication and           for
all others under DoD 4500.9 –R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part II, Cargo Movement:
   (1) Shortages of boxes, packages, or loose articles of freight in a SEAVAN, MILVAN, MSCVAN, RORO trailer, or
a CONEX (except as noted above).
   (2) Shortages in quantity of packages or loose freight as recorded on the applicable bill of lading and/or freight bill.

requisition; invoice/shipping document; authorized procurement delivery document or vendor ’s packing list; or other
authorized shipping document) which is not the result of a transportation discrepancy or product quality deficiency.
Supply discrepancies encompass variations in condition or quantity, incorrect and misdirected material, receipt          of
canceled requirements, improper or inadequate technical data or supply documentation, and any unsatisfactory         condi-
tion due to improper packaging which causes the material to be vulnerable to loss, delay, or damage, or which     imposes
unnecessary expense to the U.S. Government, e.g., excessive packaging.

Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR).
A manual form (SF 364) or its electronic equivalent used to report a supply discrepancy or other type of discrepancy
specifically authorized by this guidance e.g. specific types of product quality (including quality of service) or  billing
discrepancies in Security Assistance shipments. Also referred to as Report of Discrepancy (ROD).

Supply System Responsibility Item (SSRI).
These items are furnished by the supply system when the end item is issued and will be transferred with the end      item
during redistribution or other changes of custody unless otherwise specifically directed by the appropriate     authority.
This term equates to Components of the End Item (COEI).

Total Nonreceipt.
Complete nonreceipt of item(s) shipped.

Transportation Discrepancies.
Any variation in quantity or condition of material received from that shown in the piece count by type of pack on     the
bill of lading or governing transportation document and other deficiencies in transportation when discrepant material is
not involved; e.g., improper or inadequate carrier handling. Definitions for overage and shortage contain       exception
criteria. Security Assistance astray freight shipments and transportation discrepancies in shipments to U.S. Government
activities are reportable under DoD 4500.9 –R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part II, Cargo Movement, otherwise
not applicable to SA.

Weight Range Variation.
The weight variation between the lightest and heaviest container within each weight range of a lot. Weight              range
variations are the same within each lot. There are specified weight ranges for all chilled and frozen meat and           meat
products; i.e., 41 –45 lbs., 46 –50 lbs., etc. As long as the variation between the highest and heaviest container is   within
the specified range, a discrepancy does not exist.
