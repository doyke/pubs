                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. Conduct all evaluations in accordance with (IAW) the provisions of AFI 11-401,
Aviation Management, AFI 11-202V2, and this volume.
     1.1.1. Air Combat Command, C2ISR Operations Division (ACC/A3C), has overall
     responsibility for administration of this AFI.
     1.1.2. Copies will be current and available to planning staffs from headquarters to aircrew
     level.
1.2. Recommended Changes/Waivers. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this
AFI under normal circumstances. If an urgent requirement or aircraft emergency dictates
otherwise, the pilot in command, or instructor, will take the appropriate action to safely recover
the aircraft.
     1.2.1. Submit proposed changes to this AFI through appropriate channels to ACC/A3CH
     according to AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP). Use AF Form 847,
     Recommendation for Change of Publication.
     1.2.2. When a controlling source publication changes, that publication takes precedence until
     the change is incorporated herein. After a change is made to a controlling source, a change to
     this AFI will be distributed in a timely manner.
     1.2.3. Waiver authority for this publication is the MAJCOM/A3, IAW AFI 11-202 Volume
     2. Waivers will be requested from the parent MAJCOM Stan/Eval through appropriate
     channels. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement
     and approved through the higher level coordination authority.
1.3. Procedures:
     1.3.1. Standardization/Evaluation Flight Examiners (SEFE) will use the evaluation criteria
     contained in Table 3.1 for conducting all flight and emergency procedures evaluations.
     1.3.2. U-2 pilots normally take their instrument evaluations in the Companion Trainer
     Program (CTP) T-38. Pilots not participating in the CTP will take instrument evaluations in
     the front seat of the TU-2S. Required items for U-2 instrument evaluations are listed in
     paragraph 2.2 and Table 2.1.
     1.3.3. To complete Qualification and Mission evaluations all required areas must be
     successfully accomplished. Required areas are shown in Table 2.1. When conditions such as
     equipment malfunction, operational requirements, or weather preclude evaluation of a
     particular event in-flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method and will be documented
     in the Additional Comments portion of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
     1.3.4. U-2 mission and qualification evaluations are normally flown separately due to limited
     transition duty day and high flight time requirements. The evaluatee has the option of
     completing a combined Qualification/Mission Evaluation during the Mission Evaluation. If
     the evaluatee wishes to take this option, it must be approved by the evaluatee’s Squadron CC
     or DO and briefed in advance (before takeoff) with the SEFE. To receive credit, all required
AFI11-2U-2V2 30 MAY 2012                                                                      5


   items must be accomplished. At any point in the flight, the evaluatee may elect not to
   complete the Qualification portion; however, all items already accomplished must be graded
   by the SEFE.
   1.3.5. The SEFE will brief the evaluatee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be
   conducted prior to flight. The evaluatee will accomplish all mission planning for
   Qualification Evaluations. For Mission Evaluations, the mission planner will provide a
   mission kit for study and review. Do not grade the individual for those products computed by
   others. The individual is responsible to ensure the data used in the aircraft is accurate and
   effective for mission accomplishment. Higher Headquarters (HHQ) flight examiners (and
   unit flight examiners as determined locally) will be furnished a copy of necessary charts,
   flight logs, and any additional items they deem necessary.
   1.3.6. For non-instructor evaluations in the TU-2S, the SEFE will occupy the rear cockpit.
   For Instructor Pilot (IP) evaluations, the SEFE will occupy the front cockpit.
   1.3.7. Ground based video recorders and Global Positioning System (GPS) data may be used
   to reconstruct and evaluate the mission.
   1.3.8. The SEFE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. This debrief will include
   the evaluatee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than
   qualified) and any required additional training. To the maximum extent possible, evaluations
   will be debriefed with the SQ/CC or evaluatee’s supervisor.
1.4. Grading Instructions:
   1.4.1. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-202V2 and this
   instruction. The following criteria will be applied during all phases of flight except
   instrument finals and as noted for specific events:
 6                                                                AFI11-2U-2V2 30 MAY 2012


Table 1.1. General Criteria.

Standards/Performance Level                    Criteria

U                                              Exceeded Q- limits
     1.4.2. The flight examiner will compare the evaluatee’s performance for each area with the
     standards provided and assign an appropriate grade for each area. The overall flight
     evaluation grade is derived from the area grades and is based on a composite of the observed
     events and tasks IAW AFI 11-202V2 and this instruction. If the evaluatee receives an
     unqualified area grade in any of the CRITICAL areas identified in Table 2.1, an overall
     unqualified grade will be assigned.
1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). The EPE will be conducted as a Ground
Phase requisite of the Qualification Evaluation, Mission Evaluation, and Instrument Evaluation.
The EPE for the Qualification and Mission Evaluations should be conducted in the Mission
Procedures Trainer (MPT) when possible. If the MPT is not available, the EPE may be oral.
     1.5.1. The following items will be included on all EPEs:
        1.5.1.1. Aircraft General Knowledge.
        1.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures. For the Qualification Evaluation, evaluate a minimum
        of two emergency procedures per phase of flight (i.e., pre-takeoff, takeoff, cruise and
        landing) to include all BOLDFACE items.
        1.5.1.3. Instrument Unusual Attitude Recoveries. In-flight unusual attitude recoveries
        will not be evaluated in the U-2. Unusual attitude recoveries will be evaluated during the
        Qualification EPE. This “alternate” means of evaluation need not be documented on the
        AF Form 8.
     1.5.2. The following additional items should be included in the EPE given as a requisite to
     the Mission Evaluation. Mission Evaluation scenarios should be tailored to unit tasking and
AFI11-2U-2V2 30 MAY 2012                                                                       7


  include areas not normally evaluated in flight. EPEs for Mission Evaluations should
  maximize emphasis on mission-related tactics, procedures, and emergencies.
     1.5.2.1. Sensor and Datalink System Operation.
     1.5.2.2. Knowledge of threats and use of the Electronic Warfare System (EWS).
     1.5.2.3. Combat and Sensitive Reconnaissance Operations (SRO) primary and backup
     communication and navigation procedures.
  1.5.3. Evaluatees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
  until recommended additional training is completed and/or a reevaluation is successfully
  accomplished. Evaluatees receiving an overall unqualified grade due to an unsatisfactory
  performance of Bold Face Emergency/Critical Action Procedures will not be permitted to fly
  in their aircrew position until a successful reevaluation is accomplished. On EPEs graded as
  qualified with additional training, the SEFE will indicate whether the additional training need
  be accomplished before the next flight. Additional training and reevaluations will be
  accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2.

                                             Chapter 2

                               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General:
     2.1.1. Evaluation requirements for Qualification and Mission Evaluations listed in this
     chapter are generic. Specific areas required are listed in Table 2.1. Prior to the mission, the
     flight examiner will ensure the evaluatee understands which areas will be evaluated. The
     criteria in Table 3.1 will be used to evaluate the mission.
     2.1.2. Evaluation Requirements. Areas in Table 2.1 marked with an “R” are required
     items for that evaluation. A required area is a specific area that must be evaluated to
     complete the evaluation. All required areas must be included in the flight evaluation profile.
     However, if it is impossible to accomplish a required area in-flight, the SEFE may elect to
     evaluate the area by an alternate method (e.g., MPT, verbally, etc.), in order to complete the
     evaluation. If the SEFE determines the required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an
     alternate method, the evaluatee will require an additional flight to complete the evaluation.
2.2. Qualification Evaluation. Due to the limited numbers of U-2 aircraft and the majority of
U-2 pilots participating in the T-38 CTP, instrument evaluation requirements are normally
completed in conjunction with the T-38 Qualification/Instrument Evaluation. This requires the
U-2 Qualification Evaluation be administered as a separate event. To the maximum extent
possible, instrument evaluations will include approaches at airfields other than home or deployed
locations.
     2.2.1. The following items are requisites for initial and recurring evaluations.
        2.2.1.1. Qualification Exam (Closed Book).
        2.2.1.2. Bold Face Exam.
        2.2.1.3. Qualification Exam (Open Book).
        2.2.1.4. EPE.
        2.2.1.5. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) exam. (if also annual instrument
        qualification)
2.3. Mission Evaluation. Scenarios that represent unit Designed Operational Capability (DOC)
statement tasking and resemble operational missions satisfy the requirements of this evaluation.
Evaluations during exercises or deployments are permitted.
     2.3.1. An EPE is a requisite for initial and recurring evaluations.
     2.3.2. A handheld GPS may be used to reconstruct and evaluate the mission.
     2.3.3. Mission evaluations should include material from AFTTP 3-1.U-2 and the most
     current version of CJCSI 3250.01, and evaluators should ensure evaluatees have a working
     knowledge of both publications. Excerpts from actual OPLANs, CONPLANs, SPINs,
     CONOPs, or communications plans may be incorporated at the evaluator’s discretion.
     2.3.4. Evaluations during exercises or deployments are encouraged; however units should
     apply ORM principles to the scheduling of the evaluation. (Real world contingencies may
AFI11-2U-2V2 30 MAY 2012                                                                           9


   provide a unique opportunity to conduct evaluations; however factors beyond the control of
   the examinee and SEFE may preclude its successful completion.)
   2.3.5. Evaluations flown from the home station should utilize profiles resembling
   operational missions. Operational missions ( e.g. domestic imagery collections) are
   encouraged when available. If such a mission is not available, an INS Orbit Exercise will be
   planned and flown to simulate an actual operational mission and the evaluation will include a
   timing exercise, orbit change, simulated threat reactions, file transfer, and use of backup
   communications/navigation capabilities. INS orbit types are at the evaluator’s discretion, and
   should balance both utility of aircraft avionics capabilities and actual orbit techniques utilized
   on operational missions. Approximately one half hour of dead reckoning/pilotage navigation
   will be scheduled.
   2.3.6. For all mission evaluations, evaluatees must demonstrate working knowledge of all
   avionics pages, with specific emphasis on sensor/datalink employment, communications
   equipment/modes (e.g. secure voice and HAVE QUICK), and navigational capabilities (both
   INS and GPS).
2.4. Instructor Evaluations:
   2.4.1. All pilots selected for instructor duty must be evaluated to determine their judgment,
   technical knowledge, instructor ability (including error analysis of student activity), and use
   of grading documents as well as flying proficiency.
   2.4.2. Instructors must demonstrate timely, effective and efficient instruction to a student (or
   qualified individual acting as a student). The evaluator may require the evaluatee to present
   verbal explanations of equipment operations, procedures, and techniques. Evaluators must
   exercise sound judgment to ensure oral questions and instructions are clear, concise, pertinent
   to the individual’s crew duties, and do not interfere with normal mission accomplishment.
   The evaluator may forego additional demonstration or instruction based on time available
   and other factors.
   2.4.3. For scheduled Instructor Evaluations, an evaluator who desires a critique of areas not
   covered in the evaluatee’s prebrief will allow the evaluatee sufficient time to prepare the
   critique. For HHQ Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) administered evaluations, the
   evaluator will provide the evaluatee a performance critique as soon as possible following the
   evaluatee’s critique.
   2.4.4. Single seat U-2S (Phase II) instructor evaluations.
      2.4.4.1. Initial and requalification evaluations for single-seat U-2S instructors are
      administered in the mobile vehicle.
      2.4.4.2. Requalification evaluations will be documented on the AF Form 8. For
      Unit/CC-directed or syllabus-directed requalification programs which include a flight
      evaluation, document the mobile evaluation on the same AF Form 8 as the flight
      requalification.
      2.4.4.3. Recurring evaluations in the mobile vehicle are not required as long as IP duties
      are sampled on recurring Qualification and Mission Evaluations.
   2.4.5. Two-seat TU-2S (Phase III) instructor evaluations.
 10                                                                AFI11-2U-2V2 30 MAY 2012


       2.4.5.1. Initial and requalification evaluations for two-seat TU-2S instructors are
       administered in the TU-2S. Evaluations will include satisfactory demonstration of
       overhead, straight-in, and emergency patterns and landings performed from the rear
       cockpit. IP duties will be sampled on recurring Qualification Evaluations in the TU-2S
       (to include rear-cockpit patterns and landings) and on Mission Evaluations (normally
       flown in the U-2S).
       2.4.5.2. On an initial evaluation, the evaluatee may update the qualification expiration
       date if requisites are accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2.
       2.4.5.3. Requalification evaluations will be documented on the AF Form 8 and may be
       combined with a recurring Qualification Evaluation or Mission Evaluation (if flown in
       the TU-2S).
    2.4.6. Instructor Evaluation Grading.
       2.4.6.1. An instructor receiving an area grade of U in any instructor area will receive an
       overall Qual Level 3 for the Instructor Evaluation. The instructor may not perform

15A. Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Precautionary Pattern.

SFOs are graded from high key down to 10 feet. For the purpose of evaluating energy
management, do not plan on using the spoilers until reaching 10 feet. Use of spoilers is
authorized to ensure arrival at 10 feet within parameters. The evaluator may request to see the
maneuver repeated without the use of spoilers.

      Q          Airspeed +10/-2 knots. Arrived at 10 feet between the threshold and the first
                 1/3 of runway available. Smoothly maneuvered to target zone and in a safe
                 position to land upon reaching 10 feet.

      Q-         Airspeed +15/-5 knots. Crossed threshold below 10 feet. Arrived at 10 feet
                 between 1/3 and 1/2 of runway available. Unable to successfully perform the
