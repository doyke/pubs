   3.1.10. Communication dead spots.
   3.1.11. Jet Blast Hazards.
3.2. Vehicle Requirements.
   3.2.1. At a minimum, all vehicles that operate on the airfield will contain the following
   AFVA/decals and diagram: Note: Decals may be permanently affixed in plain view of the
   driver or clipped to the inside of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it can be
   flipped down for ready reference.
       3.2.1.1. AFVA 11-240.
       3.2.1.2. AFVA 13-222.
       3.2.1.3. A current Airfield Map (provided by Wing ADPM).
       3.2.1.4. A FOD container
3.3. Procedures for Gaining Access to the Airfield MRMA and CMA. All personnel
driving/working on the airfield will receive training, a briefing, or a qualified escort prior to
entry on the airfield.
   3.3.1. Mandatory Radio Monitor Area (MRMA). The MRMA is outlined in Attachment 9
   and is the area inside the airfield perimeter fence excluding ramp areas and the Controlled
   Movement Area (CMA). All vehicles operating in the MRMA shall be two-way radio
   equipped and capable to communicate with Tinker Ground. Vehicle operators shall monitor
   the FM Net frequency at all times in the MRMA and shall respond immediately to ground
   controls instructions. Vehicle operators shall request a radio check with the Tinker Ground,
   AM OPS, or another vehicle prior to entering the MRMA to ensure their radio is operating.
   No vehicle will operate in the MRMA unless the vehicle operator is airfield driver qualified
TINKERAFBI13-202 23 APRIL 2014                                                                 23


  and vehicle is equipped with an operable two-way radio or escorted by another vehicle that
  has operable radio capable to communicate with the ground control.
  3.3.2. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). The CMA is outlined in Attachment 9 and is the
  runway environment area outlined by runway hold short lines (200 ft from runway edge),
  mandatory signs and pavement markings, overruns, ILS glideslope, Precision Obstacle Free
  Zone (POFZ), localizer critical areas, and portions of runway clear zones.
     3.3.2.1. Airfield drivers must request and receive permission from Tinker Ground to
     enter the CMA. Using telephones or cell phones to communicate with Tinker Ground is
     prohibited. Permission cannot be relayed through another vehicle or dispatcher. While
     in the CMA, personnel must maintain direct two-way radio communications with Tinker
     Ground and monitor the radio at all times. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians must read
     back all Tinker Ground instructions verbatim. Personnel must inform Tinker Ground
     when exiting the CMA.
     3.3.2.2. For multiple vehicle operations, such as snow removal, maintenance, and/or
     construction crews, etc., at least one airfield driving qualified person shall maintain radio
     contact with Tinker Ground and accept responsibility for controlling all
     vehicles/personnel under their supervision.
  3.3.3. Base agencies that operate in the MRMA/CMA shall obtain a sufficient number of
  radios programmed for the FM Net radio frequency with the selective call feature channel
  guard capability. Radios must be programmed by the base land mobile radio (LMR) office to
  provide this capability. This will require two different radio channel numbers on the radio.
  The first channel allows two-way communication with Tinker Ground. The second channel
  number will be designated for channel guard; one-way communication with the Tinker
  Ground (receive only) and two-way communication with all other agencies on the FM Net
  radio frequency. Vehicle operators will use channel guard when conducting routine
  transmissions with agencies other than Tinker Ground. This reduces the amount of chatter on
  the FM Net radio frequency and allows Tinker Ground to make essential traffic calls. Vehicle
  operators must switch from channel guard to the second programmed channel in order to
  communicate with Tinker Ground.
  3.3.4. Short duration, non-recurring requirement (not to exceed seven days) may be satisfied
  by obtaining portable radios from AM OPS when available. Portable radios issued by AM
  OPS will be for a maximum of one day. Radio recipients must be airfield driving certified.
  TDY personnel must receive a radio/airfield refresher briefings. AM OPS personnel will
  provide these refresher briefings and a record will be kept. Upon turn-in, the radio condition
  and operation will be checked. If a radio does not operate correctly, the hand receipt will not
  be released, and AM will have the radio inspected for abuse.
  3.3.5. Contractors requiring access to the airfield for more than seven days must provide
  their own portable radios with access to communication on FM Net radio frequency.
  3.3.6. Radio operators shall acknowledge and respond to Tinker Ground instructions in a
  timely manner. In the event of radio failure by a vehicle, AM OPS will be notified by Tinker
  Ground to respond to the airfield to escort vehicle(s) off the MRMA/CMA.
  3.3.7. If radio communication is unsuccessful with Tinker Ground, point vehicle towards
  Tinker Control Tower and flash your lights. Tinker Ground will give instructions via light
24                                                     TINKERAFBI13-202 23 APRIL 2014


  gun signals (see paragraph 3.15 and Attachment 12). Reposition vehicle to a safe
  distance/location from the MRMA/CMA.
  3.3.8. If loss of radio contact occurs while vehicle is in the CMA, the operator shall
  immediately exit the CMA, hold short of all runways and reposition vehicle to a safe
  distance/location from the CMA.
  3.3.9. If Tinker Ground cannot communicate with a vehicle and the vehicle operator is
  unaware of this situation, Tinker Ground will raise and lower the intensity of the runway
  lights. At this point the vehicle should exit the runway, hold short of all runways, and

                 OUTLINE FOR UNIT ADPM CLASSROOM TRAINING

A2.1. Provide a copy of Tinker’s airfield driver training guide, Guide to Airfield Driving.
A2.2. Explanation of terms: refer to this instruction and training guide.
A2.3. No smoking on the airfield, unless in a designated smoking area, this includes inside a
vehicle.
A2.4. General Airfield Driving Procedures and Standards.
   A2.4.1. Airfield entry points. Entry points are shown in Attachment 9.2. Entry points are
   marked with warning signs stating you are entering the airfield. Only government or
   POV/contractor owned/ government leased vehicles with an airfield or ramp pass are
   authorized on the airfield. A FOD checkpoint is located at each airfield entry point.
   A2.4.2. All vehicles that operate on the airfield inside the FOD checkpoints must be
   equipped with a self-closing FOD container and a tool for removing FOD in tire treads.
   A2.4.3. FOD Control and Prevention. FOD checkpoints are black and white signs painted
   on the concrete located at airfield entry and at entry locations to areas where aircraft with
   engines running may be encountered. FOD checks must be done each and every time you
   enter these areas. Competency cards will be revoked for non-compliance. Proper
   procedures are:
       A2.4.3.1. Stop at FOD checkpoint.
       A2.4.3.2. Exit vehicle and check exposed areas of tires and undercarriage for loose
       debris. Remove debris imbedded in the tires.
       A2.4.3.3. Pull vehicle forward until the remaining area of the tire is visible and check for
       FOD.
       A2.4.3.4. Place all debris in the self-closing FOD container in the vehicle or in the FOD
       container located at the entry point. DO NOT THROW FOD ONTO THE AIRFIELD.
       A2.4.3.5. Secure loose items in vehicle cargo areas.
   A2.4.4. Vehicle Operations in Vicinity of Aircraft and Airfield Vehicle Traffic Flow.
       A2.4.4.1. Always approach parked aircraft with the driver’s side of the vehicle towards
       the aircraft and the vehicle pointed away.
       A2.4.4.2. Vehicles will not be driven or parked closer than 10 feet from a parked aircraft;
       25 feet to front, or beside an aircraft with engines running or about to be started and 50
       feet from an aircraft being (or about to be) fueled.
       A2.4.4.3. The distance behind an aircraft with engines running (or about to be started) is
       200 feet, except for heavy aircraft such as B-1, B-52, C-5, C-17, DC/KC-10, E-3, E-4, E-
       6 and KC-135 which is 600feet.
       A2.4.4.4. Vehicles shall not be backed toward, driven under or driven forward in the
       immediate direction of any aircraft except as authorized in certain loading, unloading, or
       refueling operations. In these cases, pre-positioned wheel chocks will be placed between

     the aircraft and the approaching vehicle to prevent the vehicle from striking the aircraft.
     Guides will be posted as a required safety measure.
     A2.4.4.5. Use taxiway centerlines as road dividers and remain immediately to the right.
     A2.4.4.6. Do a visual check before crossing an intersecting taxiway.
     A2.4.4.7. Traffic lanes on the aircraft parking ramps are normally the areas to the right of
     the aircraft or parallel to the noses of the parked aircraft with the driver’s side toward the
     aircraft. Some ramp areas have clearly marked vehicle traffic lanes.
     A2.4.4.8. Give way to aircraft taxiing, in-tow, or being led by a Follow-Me vehicle. Do
     not drive between a Follow-Me vehicle and the aircraft that it is guiding.
     A2.4.4.9. Organizations operating around aircraft must stress speed and procedures for
     your organization’s vehicle traffic flow.
  A2.4.5. Procedures for operating a vehicle on the Mandatory Radio Monitor Area (MRMA)
  and the Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
     A2.4.5.1. When in the MRMA/CMA, always be aware of your surroundings. There are
     always aircraft, vehicles and equipment moving on the airfield.
     A2.4.5.2. Airfield drivers must always monitor the Tinker Ground frequency while
     operating in the MRMA and comply with instructions from Tinker Ground as requested.
     Airfield drivers shall establish direct radio communications with Tinker Ground to obtain
     permission to enter the CMA. Use of a third party for communications with Tinker
     Ground is prohibited. The driver will provide Tinker Ground their radio callsign,
     location of entrance to the CMA, and intent. The airfield diagram in Attachment 9
     depicts the CMA boundary. Non-compliance with the instruction will result in a CMA
     violation. Airfield drivers shall read back all instructions by Ground Control to hold
     short of all runways or runway. Airfield drivers will maintain continuous radio contact
     with Tinker Ground while in the CMA and will advise Ground when off the CMA.
     A2.4.5.3. Vehicle’s four-way flashers/emergency lights or beacon will operate at all
     times (day and night) while operating in the MRMA, CMA and all RAMPS.
     A2.4.5.4. Authorized Airfield Vehicle Traffic/Runway Crossings. Runways will not be
     used for crossings for convenience. Only mission essential vehicle operations outlined in
     this instruction are authorized to enter or cross a runway. Vehicle use of the airfield will
     be monitored by AM to ensure compliance with airfield driving procedures. Use of the
     airfield for convenience shall not be tolerated.
     A2.4.5.5. Vehicles shall give way to taxiing or in-tow aircraft. If an aircraft is
     approaching your vehicle, exit at the nearest intersecting taxiway or reverse course. Do
     not drive off pavement, except as a last resort.
     A2.4.5.6. Vehicles will not operate or be left unattended within the lateral obstacle
     clearance zones of runways, taxiways and aprons unless mission essential and in
     continuous communication with Tinker Ground.
TINKERAFBI13-202 23 APRIL 2014                                                               47

       A2.4.5.7. If escorting another vehicle, discuss route to be taken with the other driver.
       Remain together until mission is complete and off the airfield. Ensure both vehicles have
       hazard or rotating beacon lights on while operating on the airfield.
       A2.4.5.8. When exiting the CMA, notify Ground Control with location of exit point.
       A2.4.5.9. Vehicle Breakdown. If for any reason the vehicle fails to operate under its
       own power while in the MRMA and CMA, immediately contact Ground Control of the
       nature of the problem and your position on the airfield. Ground Control will then contact
       appropriate personnel and reroute any taxiing aircraft.
   A2.4.6. Procedures for proper radio terminology/phraseology and discipline. Refer to
   Airfield Training Guide and this instruction.
       A2.4.6.1. Make clear and concise radio transmissions and use proper radio terminology.
       Do not use 10 code/series phraseology.
       A2.4.6.2. Ensure Tinker Ground’s instructions are understood and followed. Read back
       hold-short instructions received from Tinker Ground.
       A2.4.6.3. After making a request to Tinker Ground, make sure the next transmission
       from Tinker Ground is yours, listen for your call sign. Tinker Ground is in
       communications with other vehicles and aircraft, don’t assume the next radio
       transmission is yours.
       A2.4.6.4. Ensure the radio frequency is open before making a transmission, do not
       interrupt another radio transmission. Maintain good radio etiquette.
       A2.4.6.5. Using telephones or cell phones to communicate with Tinker Ground is
       prohibited. Permission cannot be relayed through another vehicle or dispatcher.
48                                                     TINKERAFBI13-202 23 APRIL 2014


     A2.4.6.6. Radios must be programmed by the base land mobile radio (LMR) office to
     provide selective call feature. This will require two different radio channel numbers on
     the radio. The first channel allows two-way communication with Tinker Ground. The
     second channel number will be designated for channel guard; one-way communication
     with the Tinker Ground (receive only) and two-way communication with all other
     agencies on the FM Net radio frequency. Vehicle operators will use channel guard when
     conducting routine transmissions with agencies other than Tinker Ground. This reduces
     the amount of chatter on the FM Net radio frequency and allows Tinker Ground to make
     essential traffic calls. Vehicle operators must switch from channel guard to the second
     programmed channel in order to communicate with Tinker Ground.
     A2.4.6.7. When in doubt, ask Tinker Ground to repeat instructions.
     A2.4.6.8. Vehicles with radios can escort vehicles without radios. When escorting,
     vehicles must remain together at all times in the MRMA and CMA.
     A2.4.6.9. Do not use the words CLEAR or CLEARANCE. These words are part of Air
     Traffic Control terminology. It may also cause another driver to mistake the radio
     transmission for his/her authorization. Example: “Tinker Ground, Ops-29, Off Runway
     18 at Taxiway Charlie.”
     A2.4.6.10. Radio Communications in the CMA will be closely monitored by AM.
     Individuals failing to use proper communications with Tinker Ground will be checked by
     AM. Proper communication includes using vehicle call signs on each and every
     transmission, repeating hold short instructions, monitoring the radio, and responding to
     radio calls promptly.
  A2.4.7. Speed Limits for vehicle parking areas/aircraft parking ramps/airfield access
  roads/taxiways/runways/towing operations. General purpose vehicle: 15 MPH; Special
  purpose: 10 MPH; EXCEPTION: Normal vehicle speed limit on the runway during non-
  emergency operations will be 30 MPH or as necessary to expedite exit at Control Tower
  direction. Speed limits for all emergency response vehicles responding to bona fide
  emergency situations will be a speed that is necessary to respond expeditiously and safely.
  No vehicle will operate in excess of 5 MPH when within 50ft of an aircraft. No vehicle will
  operate at a speed in excess of that deemed reasonable and prudent for existing traffic, road,
  and weather conditions. If Tinker Ground, AM personnel, unit driving program manager,
  commander, or anyone else on the airfield takes notice of your speed, then you are speeding.
  Normally, a warning via the radio will be issued unless driver is using unusually excess
  speeds. If the warning is not followed, then you will be instructed to either hold your
  position until AM responds or report to AM Operations.
  A2.4.8. Airfield and Instrument signs and markings, to include requirements to stop at INST
  holding positions.
     A2.4.8.1. Of primary concern are the HOLD SHORT LINE markings. This line marks
     the boundary of the runway. Look for multiple yellow lines on a black background 200
     feet from the runway edge. DO NOT CROSS this line without authorization from Tinker
     Ground.
TINKERAFBI13-202 23 APRIL 2014                                                               49


     A2.4.8.2. Co-located with the painted HOLD SHORT LINE marking is the RUNWAY
     HOLD POSITION SIGN, located to the left side of taxiway/runway boundary. This sign
     is on a red background with white numbers and is lighted for night/inclement weather
     operations. See Attachment 13.3 for example.
     A2.4.8.3. Boundaries for the Instrument Land System (ILS) areas are marked by
     INSTRUMENT (INST) HOLD LINES. When personnel or equipment are within the
     ILS area, it could seriously degrade the ILS performance. INST Hold Lines are painted
     with multiple yellow lines on a black background. Drivers will stop at INST Hold Lines
     and request permission from Tinker Ground to proceed across. CAUTION: Permission to
     proceed across an INST Hold Line is not authorization to cross a normal HOLD SHORT
     LINE.
     A2.4.8.4. Co-located with the painted INST HOLD LINE marking is the INST HOLD
     LINE SIGN. This mandatory sign, located to the left of the INST hold line, has a red
     background with the letters ILS in white. The INST sign is illuminated for nighttime and
     inclement weather operations. Roadways that enter an ILS critical area have unlit signs
     warning vehicle operators not to proceed without approval from Tinker Ground. See
     Attachment 13.3 for example.
     A2.4.8.5. Painted runway markings are depicted with white retro reflective paint,
     taxiways and ramps have yellow markings. See attachments 9 and 10 for location of
     INST, hold short lines, and critical areas.
     A2.4.8.6. Taxiway line markings are used as guides for taxiing aircraft. Vehicles will
     use the markings as a road divider.
     A2.4.8.7. Taxiway Guidance and Informative signs identify location, direction, and
     designations of taxiways. Taxiway signs have black background with yellow lettering or
     yellow background with black lettering. Yellow lettering identifies the taxiway you are
     own, and black lettering identifies the taxiway you are approaching. Informative signs are
     lighted for night/inclement weather. See attachment 13.4 for example.
     A2.4.8.8. Airfield lighting examples are depicted in Attachment 13.1 of this instruction.
  A2.4.9. Night and Inclement Weather Driving.
  A2.4.9.1. The airfield environment at night is different than the day. The night environment
  may not be as busy, but can be more hazardous due to impaired vision caused by the
  darkness and the confusion caused by the various lights on the airfield. When driving at
  night, use more caution.
  A2.4.9.2. Aircraft have the right of way on the airfield. Do not shine your vehicle
  headlights towards a moving aircraft. Turn vehicle headlights off, but always keep the four-
  way flashers or beacon on. Turning off headlights prevents temporary blindness in the pilot
  or tow operator. Leaving flashers or beacon operating lets the pilot/tow operator and Tinker
  Ground know your location at all times. Vehicles with day running lights will position
  vehicle where lights do not shine toward a moving aircraft.
     A2.4.9.3. The Tinker Base Weather Station disseminates weather advisories, watches,
     and warnings on the local LAN during periods of inclement weather. Unit Commanders
50                                                     TINKERAFBI13-202 23 APRIL 2014


     may impose additional airfield restrictions on their unit drivers. AFI 91-203 provides
     additional safety information and guidance.
  A2.4.10. Runway Entry/Crossing, Runway Incursion Prevention, and Reduce non-essential
  vehicle movements on the airfield and procedures to limit vehicle traffic crossing the runway
  to an absolute minimum.
     A2.4.10.1. Emphasize the possible consequences of crossing or entering the runway
     without authorization from Tinker Ground. Unauthorized vehicles on the runway cause
     a serious potential for death and destruction. Failure to obtain authorization prior to
     entering or crossing any runway is considered a runway incursion. Incursions are serious
     and all vehicle operators must be thoroughly trained in runway entry/crossing procedures
     to prevent such occurrences. Remember, the primary function of a runway is the landing
     and take-off of aircraft.
     A2.4.10.2. Emphasize and explain the Hold Short Line and Runway Hold Position
     Sign.
     A2.4.10.3. Stop at the Hold Short Line marking/Runway Hold Position sign and obtain
     authorization from Tinker Ground to cross a runway. Give Tinker Ground your location
     on the airfield.
     A2.4.10.4. If requesting to enter a runway, give location, and intent. Note: The only
     vehicles that have a mission requirement to be on the runways are Airfield Management,
     Airfield Lighting, CE, Pavements, SOF, Fire Department, FOD BOSS, and Safety.
     Remind potential drivers that only mission essential vehicle operations are permitted in
     the MRMA/CMA. Non-essential vehicle traffic must use perimeter roads.
     A2.4.10.5. The only area on the airfield that does not have Hold Short markings to define
     the runway is where the runways intersect; however, runway hold position signs are
     installed. To cross or enter the intersecting runway, stop 200 feet prior to the intersecting
     runway at the runway hold position sign before requesting authorization from Ground
     Control. To cross an extended runway centerline beyond the overrun, stop a minimum of
     200 feet from edge of runway environment and request authorization from Ground
     Control.
     A2.4.10.6. When authorization is given by Tinker Ground, read-back the instructions
     while doing a visual check of the runway in both directions, then cross or enter the
     runway.
     A2.4.10.7. As soon as the vehicle has passed the Hold Short Line at the exit location or,
     if no hold line, 200 feet from the runway, inform Tinker Ground that you are “OFF” the
     runway and name the exit location. Do not use the word clear to report off a runway.
  A2.4.11. Procedures for operating vehicles with daytime running lights. At night, vehicles
  with daytime running lights will not shine the vehicle lights towards a moving aircraft, but
  will park in a safe location that will allow lights pointing away from aircraft with parking
  brake set and emergency flashers on.
  A2.4.12. Vehicle Parking and Chocking Procedures.
     A2.4.12.1. POV are not authorized on the airfield without prior AM approval. There is
     no open POV parking on the airfield.
TINKERAFBI13-202 23 APRIL 2014                                                                51


     A2.4.12.2. Unless parked in a designated parking area, all unattended vehicles
     temporarily parked on the airfield will park so that they will not interfere with taxiing or
     towed aircraft and will not be pointed towards a parked aircraft. When parked, turn
     ignition off and leave keys in the ignition. If vehicle has a manual transmission, place it
     in reverse, or if automatic, place it in park. Then set parking brake and leave the doors
     unlocked.
     A2.4.12.3. Use chocks to secure all vehicles and wheeled equipment that do not have an
     integral braking system when they are left unattended on the aircraft parking ramp. Refer
     to procedures for special purpose vehicles. Vehicles parked on a designated parking area
     are exempt.
     A2.4.12.4. When parked on the airfield, leave emergency lights/four-way flashers or
     beacon operating unless parked in a designated parking area.
     A2.4.12.5. Never leave your vehicle while on the airfield without advising Tinker
     Ground of your intentions, unless parked in a designated parking area.
  A2.4.13. Airfield Violations and Consequences. Refer to chapter 4 of this instruction for
  detailed information.
     A2.4.13.1. Speeding, recklessness, ignoring FOD checkpoints, and improper vehicle
     operation are some examples.
     A2.4.13.2. AM personnel, unit commander, or program managers can revoke airfield
     driver privileges for any airfield driving violation.
     A2.4.13.3. Security Forces may stop you for an airfield driving violation, but will refer
     your violation to AM for action.
  A2.4.14. Airfield Driving and Incursion Prevention Video and/or CD’s. Show the airfield
  driving and Runway Incursion Prevention or CD’s to class. Copies of both video’s and/or
  CD’s are provided by AM.
  A2.4.15. Airfield Driving CBT. Candidates must complete the CBT as part of classroom
  training. (complete no earlier than 30 days of initial, refresher, or recertification training)
  The CBT is available on ADLS web page. The CBT test is not the final written test. The
  CBT will also be required as part of annual refresher training.
  A2.4.16. Unique unit requirements/operations and local restrictions.
     A2.4.16.1. Taxiways Bravo, Kilo, Hotel and Golf are restricted to vehicle/aircraft use
     during AWACS Live Fires. Tinker Ground will issue appropriate advisories.
     A2.4.16.2. Local terms. Around the Horn and Multiple Intersection are synonymous and
     are used when referring to the intersection at the north side of Runway 13/31 at Taxiways
     C, H and K. Use of either phrase is correct when requesting permission through this area.
  A2.4.16.3. Taxiway Golf, from taxiway Echo to taxiway Foxtrot, is a restricted area.
  Approval must be granted by 72 SFS.
     A2.4.16.4. Your unit requirements briefing.
  A2.4.17. Emergency vehicle operations. Drivers will give way/yield to all fire/crash
  vehicles, ambulances, and other vehicles (AM Ops, Security, Safety) responding to an
52                                                    TINKERAFBI13-202 23 APRIL 2014


  emergency. All emergency response vehicles must comply with airfield driving procedures
  for entry into and operation in the MRMA and CMA. EXCEPTION: Emergency response
  vehicles and AM vehicle procedures as outlined in TAFBI 13-201.
  A2.4.18. Tower or vehicle radio problem areas and visual blind spots. Areas for potential
  radio blind spots when communicating with Tinker Ground include the ALC ramp, TMF,
  Echo ramp, and southern and western portions of the airfield. Some of same areas cannot be
  seen from the Control Tower.
  A2.4.19. Procedures or restrictions for operating motorcycles, mopeds or scooters, bicycles,
  tricycles and other vehicles. Bi/Tricycle operations will be operated only within unit ramp
  areas and not in the MRMA/CMA. Bi/Tricycle operators must be airfield driver certified.
  Motorcycle/Moped operations on the airfield are prohibited except in designated vehicle
  parking areas and for the purpose of participating in the Motorcycle hands-on training class
  sponsored by Base Safety. Refer to chapter 3 of this instruction for additional guidance.
