SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This change
removes references to C-5 in drop zone and Special Operations Low Level (SOLL)
requirements. It adds landing zone criteria for the U-28A, updates Engineering Technical Letter
(ETL) references for landing zone surveys, adds requirement for determining runway friction
factors for C-17 operations, clarifies waiver and deviation paragraphs, and standardizes C-130
minimum runway length and turning criteria for night vision goggle (NVG) operations.
Standards for joint precision airdrop systems (JPADS) and improved-container delivery system
(I-CDS) drops were added. The requirements for safety-of-flight reviews were clarified.
Personnel authorized to perform landing zone safety officer (LZSO) duties away from their local
landing zone (LZ) were expanded to include United States Air Force Weapons School
(USAFWS) Weapons Officer airlift cadre. Provisions were included to allow
training/certification of non-USAF/Non-aircrew personnel to perform LZSO duties during
contingency operations. Low velocity / high velocity container delivery system (LV/HV-CDS)
and low cost airdrop systems (LCADS) were added to drop zones (DZ) criteria tables. Basic
guidelines for off DZ airdrops were added. This change also clarifies the requirements for
contractors controlling AF assault zones and mandates that all completed surveys be forwarded
to Air Mobility Command (AMC) for inclusion in the assault zone database. As an
administrative note, all Combat Control forces have been placed under Air Force Special
Operations Command (AFSOC) in the 720 Special Tactics Group (STG) and are now referred to
as Special Tactics (ST) forces, or Special Tactics Squadrons (STS). Requests for ST support
should be directed to 720 STG, Hurlburt Field FL. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the
previous edition.

(AFSOC) This document has been substantially revised and must be thoroughly reviewed. This
supplement adds expedited off-DZ incident investigations for military free fall (MFF)
operations; adds LZ criteria for AFSOC Light Tactical Fixed-Wing (LTFW) aircraft; and adds
steps to use random DZ procedures on current DZs. Tier requirements have been annotated.

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. General. This publication outlines drop zone size and marking criteria, aerial delivery
methods and parameters, operating procedures for qualified personnel, landing zone survey and
helicopter landing zone survey requests and review processes, and LC-130 skiway and ski
landing area criteria. Use this publication in conjunction with aircraft flight publications and
applicable USAF and MAJCOM directives.
1.2. International Agreements. The Air Force must abide by and implement certain
international military standardization agreements. This regulation implements Air and Space
Interoperability Council (ASIC) Air Standards (AIR STD), North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) Standardization Agreement (STANAG), and International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) agreements. These include but are not limited to AIR STD 44/35G, Drop Zones and
Extraction Zones: Criteria, Markings and Information Check Lists, AIR STD 44/37C, Criteria
for Selection and Marking of Landing Zones for Fixed Wing Aircraft, STANAG 3146, Planning
Procedures for Tactical Air Transport Operations, STANAG 3345, Data/Forms for Planning
Air Movements, STANAG 3570, Drop Zones and Extraction Zones, and 3601, Criteria for
Selection and Marking of Landing Zones for Fixed-Wing Transport Aircraft.
1.3. Deviations and waivers. For the purposes of this publication, the term MAJCOM also
applies to Direct Reporting Units (DRUs), Field Operating Agencies (FOA), and the National
Guard Bureau (NGB). Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI except in the
interest of safety or during contingency operations. Report deviations or exception without
waiver through channels to MAJCOM Stan/Eval function who, in turn, should notify the OPR
(lead command) for follow-on action, if necessary.
   1.3.1. Waivers will be requested through command and control channels. Unless otherwise
   directed in this AFI, waiver authority for the contents of this document is MAJCOM/A3.
   During contingency operations, waiver authority rests with the air component commander
   who currently has operational control (OPCON) of forces. Waiver authority may be
   delegated no lower than an O-6 (Colonel). MAJCOMs will provide HQ USAF/A3OS copies
   of approved waivers, and file waivers in the back of this instruction until rescinded.
   1.3.1. (AFSOC) The HQ AFSOC/A3 is the waiver authority for this publication. The HQ
   AFSOC/A3 may delegate waiver authority to a designated COMAFSOF for forces under
   their OPCON. The 24 Special Operations Wing (SOW)/Commander (CC) may be delegated
   waiver authority for special tactics issues concerning the 720 Special Tactics Group (STG)
   and 724 STG by memorandum from the HQ AFSOC/A3. AFRC units will forward waiver
   requests through standardization and evaluation office channels to HQ AFRC/A3V for
   coordination with HQ AFSOC.
       1.3.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of
       risk.
           1.3.1.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) "Tier 0"        (T-0) requirements are reserved for
           requirements that non-compliance is determined and waived by respective non-Air
           Force authority.

           1.3.1.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) "Tier 1"       (T-1) requirements are reserved for
           requirements that non-compliance may put airman, mission, or program strongly at
           risk, and may only be waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate with concurrence of
           publication approver. When multiple MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is
           appropriate.
           1.3.1.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) "Tier 2"            (T-2) requirements are reserved for
           requirements that potentially put the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission
           or program, and may only be waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate.
           1.3.1.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) "Tier 3"        (T-3) requirements are reserved for
           requirements that non-compliance has a remote risk of mission failure, and may be
           waived by the Wing/CC but no lower than the OG/CC.
     1.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) Any waivers issued under COMAFSOF authority will be
     forwarded through operational reporting channels to HQ AFSOC/A3V for tracking. (T-2)
1.4. Landing Zone Survey Requests. No later than 120 days prior to scheduled use, contact
the appropriate theater special tactics unit: NORTHCOM/SOUTHCOM/CENTCOM - 720th
Special Tactics Group, Hurlburt Field, FL; EUCOM - 352nd Special Operations Group, RAF
Mildenhall, England (DSN 314 238-4764); and PACOM - 353rd Special Operations Group,
Kadena AB, Japan (DSN 315 634-8545).
1.4. (AFSOC)Landing Zone Survey Requests. For United States European Command
(USEUCOM) requests contact 321 STS at Defense Switched Network (DSN) 3142382282.
1.5. Zone Availability Report. The Zone Availability Report (ZAR) is a comprehensive listing
of drop zones and landing zones available for use by the Department of Defense (DoD).
However, the information in the ZAR does not replace the need for a completed survey prior to
conducting LZ operations. Completed DZ/LZ surveys will be forwarded to HQ AMC/A3DT
(DSN 779-3148/1765) for inclusion in the ZAR. Completed surveys are available for military
(.mil)      users       on       the      ZAR          Web        Site       located       at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AM-40.

NOTE: Other MAJCOMs and contingency AOCs (Air Operations Center) may maintain their
own ZAR database (if desired). However, this does not alleviate them from the responsibility to
provide these surveys to HQ AMC/A3DT for inclusion in the worldwide ZAR database, unless
classification requirements dictate otherwise.
1.5. (AFSOC)Zone Availability Report. The ZAR Web Site is located at
https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AM-40/default.aspx. Talon Point, a web-based survey global
zone data-base, is an alternate source for surveys. The ZAR is the primary source and must
always be referenced to ensure the most current survey is used. Talon Point is currently only
located      on      the      secure     internet   protocol  network      (SIPRNET)       at
https://talonpoint.snlca.nro.smil.mil/TalonPoint/home.

                                 DROP ZONE OPERATIONS

2.1. General. This chapter outlines the basic criteria, markings, and procedures used in support
of airdrops. It describes the responsibilities of the Drop Zone Controller (DZC), the supported
unit's Drop Zone Safety Officer (DZSO), and the DZ survey process.
   2.1.1. Airdrop guidance may be visual or self-contained and may be directed by either the
   aircrew or the supported force. Computed air release point (CARP) airdrops are directed by
   the aircrew based upon visual references. Self-contained airdrops are directed by the aircrew
   using onboard navigation equipment, global positioning system (GPS), adverse weather
   aerial delivery system (AWADS), radar beacon, or ground radar delivery system (GRADS).
   Ground mark release system (GMRS), verbally initiated release system (VIRS), and
   jumpmaster directed (JMD) airdrops are directed by supported forces.
2.2. Responsibility. DZ size and selection are the shared responsibility of the supporting force
commander and the supported force commander. The supported force is responsible for DZ
establishment, operation, safety, and for the elimination or acceptance of ground hazards
associated with the DZ. The use of standard DZ sizes depicted in Table 2.1 and Figure 2.1 are
essential to safe operations. They are required for Air Force unilateral aircrew training, and
recommended for allied/joint training airdrops. The supported force will take responsibility for
injury of personnel and damage to equipment that could result from using a DZ that does not
meet the standard DZ size criteria.
   2.2.1. The airlift mission commander is normally responsible for airdrop accuracy and
   safety-of-flight for all aircrew directed airdrops at drop zones meeting the above size criteria.
   2.2.2. The supported force is normally responsible for airdrop accuracy when using GMRS
   or VIRS, or JMD release procedures.
   2.2.3. The jumpmaster is responsible for airdrop accuracy when using JMD release
   procedures.
2.3. Drop Altitudes. During contingency and wartime operations, the supported forces
commander, in conjunction with the supporting forces commander, will determine the drop
altitude for personnel and equipment drops. Additional guidance for personnel deployments may
be found in AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations, AFMAN 11-411(I), Military Free-
Fall Parachuting, AFMAN 11-420(I), Static Line Parachuting Techniques and Training, and
AFI 11-231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures.
2.4. Drop Airspeeds. Standard parachute airdrops are performed at the airspeed ranges
indicated in mission design series (MDS) specific aircraft AFI and AFI 11-231 (for CARP).

 Note          18 ft platforms: The number of platforms used to calculate the minimum
               size drop zone is determined by platform placement as well as the number of
               platforms actually on board the aircraft. The number of empty positions aft of
               an actual platform/pallet being dropped must be added to the overall number
               of pallets. For example: 1 platform in position 1L, and 1 platform in position
               4R would require calculations based on 5 platforms.

               463L or 8 ft training platforms: Minimum drop zone size is 1600 yds long
               by 600 yds wide for the 2 or 3 pallet/platform training configuration.

        Proving Grounds (YPG). DZ size requirements at YPG are at the discretion of
        AMC/A3D, NATICK and YPG as necessary for testing, development and evaluation of
        JPADS systems. JPADS upgrade training for aircrews may occur at YPG or DZ sizes
        smaller than stated above with the concurrence of AMC/A3D.
     b. During contingency use, recommended minimum JPADS DZ size is 200-300 meters
        (218 – 328 yards) radius circular. Ultimately, minimum JPADS DZ size restsmwith the
        user and the Joint Force Commander (or Director of Mobility Forces if so delegated).

Note: For AFSOC C-145A operations only, AFSOC/A3 revises standard drop zone size criteria
for Low Cost-Low Altitude (LCLA) and Standard Airdrop Training Bundles (SATB).
2.5. Drop Zone Criteria. DZ selection should be based on enemy threats, mission
requirements, aircraft and/or aircrew capabilities, parachutist capabilities, type parachutes used,
and type equipment to be airdropped. Airdrops of USAF personnel and/or USAF equipment
from USAF aircraft on DZs that do not meet AF minimum size requirements must be waivered
IAW paragraph 1.3.
   2.5.1. Military Free Fall (MFF) DZ (including operations utilizing MC-4, MC-5, SOV-3HH
   or approved equivalent parachutes deployed in freefall or by static line). The jumpmaster will
   determine the minimum size DZ based on the number of personnel to be dropped, jumper
   proficiency, and the prevailing winds. See paragraph 2.22.4 for demonstration DZ.
   2.5.2. Joint Precision Airdrop System/Improved Container Delivery System (JPADS/I-CDS)
   DZ. JPADS refers to both GPS guided systems and traditional ballistic airdrop loads utilizing
   Precision Airdrop System Mission Planner (PADS-MP) for more precise computed release
   points. Ballistic airdrop loads used in conjunction with the PADS-MP are referred to as
   Improved CDS (I-CDS). All airdrop sonde and JPADS guided system operations require that
   the aircraft a valid preflight weather file (1D or 3D) obtained from the Air Force Weather
   Agency (AFWA) and a GPS Figure of Merit (FOM) of 3 or less (to ensure proper component
   wind measuring and steering) inside 1 minute prior to the drop. Aircraft FOM release
   procedures and standards are found in AFI 11-2C-MDS-V3 publications. The crew should
   execute a sonde drop and merge the results with a valid AFWA wind file prior to dropping I-
   CDS or a JPADS guided system. For JPADS and I-CDS training drops, a NOTAM will be
   filed for all high altitude airdrops. The NOTAM’d airspace must be no smaller than the
   diameter of the largest failure footprint ellipse for the highest drop altitude. Guided system
   minimum drop altitude may be as low as 7,000 ft. AGL, but should be conducted no lower
   than 10,000 ft. AGL to allow time for GPS acquisition, load stabilization, and guidance to the
   drop zone point of impact.
       2.5.2.1. JPADS (Guided Systems) DZs. JPADS DZs are typically circular. The point of
       impact (PI) for JPADS DZs is located at the DZ center-point. PI placement should allow
       for a circular DZ of minimum size to be contained within the surveyed DZ boundaries in
       the event a circular DZ survey does not exist. Some JPADS multi-platform loads may
       drive elliptical DZs, approximated by rectangular surveyed boundaries. There is no
       rectangular AFI 13-217 minimum DZ size requirement for JPADS loads, however a
       rectangular DZ may be used if the circular DZ requirements are met within the
       boundaries of the rectangular DZ.
           2.5.2.1.1. During contingency operations, the supported force will determine the
           JPADS (guided systems) minimum DZ size under advisement of the supporting force
14                                                    AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


        aircrew using Table 2.1 Note 5.b. as a starting reference. During contingency
        operations, a JPADS DZ and Launch Acceptability Region should be located within a
        Restricted Operating Zone (ROZ). JPADS DZs will be selected to guarantee that all
        bundles land within its confines to the maximum extent possible.
        2.5.2.1.2. During training operations, GPS guided system drops are limited to DZs
        resident in restricted areas and airspace. The aircrew/supporting force must ensure
        through a collateral damage assessment IAW 2.5.2.4, that the load will impact the DZ
        or non-populated/built-up area within the restricted area in the event of a chute or
        guidance system malfunction. To ensure all loads land within the restricted airspace,
        success and failure footprints generated by the PADS-MP will be located within the
        restricted area. In addition to the guidance in paragraph 2.5.2, during training
        missions, guided systems will only be dropped when the aircraft is within the 70
        percent Launch Acceptable Region (LAR), the Airborne Guidance Unit (ABU) has a
        valid GPS lock, and the aircraft is at or above the system specific minimum release
        altitude.
        2.5.2.1.2. (AFSOC) JPADS training airdrops for which success and failure
        footprints fall outside of the lateral and vertical limits of a restricted area require an
        AFSOC/A3 waiver. (T-2)
     2.5.2.2. I-CDS. I-CDS DZs are typically normal rectangular CDS/HVCDS DZs IAW
     Table 2.1. However, unlike traditional CDS, I-CDS provides the ability to “target” a
     specific bundle for PI impact. For circular DZs, it may be appropriate to target the middle
     bundle in a stick. If targeting the first bundle, follow standard PI placement criteria in
     Table 2.2. For all I-CDS airdrop, independent of the targeted bundle, ensure that the 63%
     ellipse is entirely contained within the surveyed DZ boundaries.
        2.5.2.2.1. During contingency operations, I-CDS minimum DZ size is at the
        discretion of the supported force and the JFC. The user will accept responsibility for
        damage to structures, persons and equipment located on the surveyed DZ or the
        Table 2.1 minimum sized DZ, whichever is greater, as a result of the airdrop.
        2.5.2.2.2. During training operations, I-CDS airdrop operations DO NOT have to be
        within a restricted area. For high-altitude airdrop operations, a restricted area is highly
        recommended. Normal high-altitude CDS/HVCDS minimum DZ requirements in
        Table 2.1 will be used.
     2.5.2.3. Drop sondes. Drop sondes do not have a minimum DZ size and are deliberately
     manually released from the aircraft. During contingency operations, drop sondes may be
     released anywhere in the vicinity of the objective area and do not have to land on the DZ.
     If not dropping on a surveyed DZ, the aircrew must coordinate with the Air Mobility
     Division Tactics personnel to ensure the sonde will not cause injury to personnel or
     damage to facilities. During training operations, drop sonde release must be incorporated
     into the collateral damage assessment to ensure that the sonde will land on the DZ or
     within a restricted area.
     2.5.2.4. JPADS/I-CDS Collateral Damage Assessments. Collateral Damage Assessments
     (CDA) are required for all JPADS (guided systems) and I-CDS airdrop operations. CDAs
     are a necessary safety measure to mitigate as much damage risk as possible to aircraft,
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                             15


     people, buildings and equipment on the DZ and surrounding areas. The CDA must be
     accomplished for areas surrounding the DZ out to the furthest potential failure footprint
     points created by the PADS-MP with a valid AFWA wind file. The CDA must include a
     review of:
          63% I-CDS success ellipse

          Load malfunctions (fouled chute, broken guide lines, separated chute) that prevent
           I-CDS loads from falling according to published ballistic data

          Loss of GPS link on a guided load (3:1 glide ratio from drop altitude)

          Load malfunction (fouled chute, broken guide lines, etc) that prevents guided
           loads from navigating to the DZ
         2.5.2.4.1. During contingency operations, the surveying or controlling unit, the user
         and the JFC designated agency must accomplish a CDA. The user/supported force
         ultimately accepts responsibility for all damage to structures, persons and equipment
         as a result of the airdrop.
         2.5.2.4.2. During normal training, coordinate with the owning agency of the special
         use airspace and landowners (as necessary) with property surrounding the DZ for all
         JPADS/I-CDS operations. Examine the area in the vicinity of the DZ for potential
         damage in the course of normal operations or during extraordinary system failure
         events. CDA coordination with the owning agency(s) of the DZ, airspace and
         underlying ground space, must be accomplished prior to a DZ being approved for
         JPADS guided systems.
         2.5.2.4.3. Mission planners and aircrew must update the JPADS DZ CDA with the
         owning agency(s) for changes prior to each drop operation. If the CDA demonstrates
         potential airdrop load damage , restrict airdrop release (LAR), change drop altitude
         (lower), change airdrop run-in, change parachute/system type, accept the risk or
         cancel operations. Inform the controlling unit of the risk to their operations. The
         controlling unit, and the JFC designated agency are approving authorities for risk to
         the area surrounding the DZ. Intelligence personnel are responsible for providing the
         JFC-designated agency close-up and overview imagery to facilitate CDAs.
  2.5.3. Random Approach DZ. A random approach DZ is a variation of a previously surveyed
  DZ and of sufficient size to permit multiple run-in headings. Any axis of approach may be
  used as long as the resulting DZ meets the minimum criteria for the load/personnel being
  airdropped and remains within the boundaries of the original surveyed DZ (see Table 2.1 and
  Figure 2.1). In all cases, perform a safety-of-flight review IAW paragraph 2.22.1.2 prior to
  use.
     2.5.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) For personnel MFF operations, unit or mission commanders
     may permit the use of random approach DZ procedures on current DZs, except when
     specifically prohibited by the DZ survey or local procedures. Aircrews will thoroughly
     review the airspace, terrain, obstacles, etc. surrounding the DZ prior to conducting MFF
     operations using random approach DZ procedures. (T-2)
 16                                                     AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


   2.5.4. Area DZ. An area DZ (Figure 2.2) consists of a start point (point A), an endpoint
   (point B), and a pre-arranged flight path (line-of-flight) over a series of acceptable drop sites
   between these points. The distance between points A and B generally should not exceed 15
   nautical miles and changes in ground elevation within NM of centerline should not exceed
   300 feet. The reception committee may receive the drop at any location between point A and
   point B within NM of center-line. Once the pre-briefed signal or electronic NAVAID has
   been identified and located, the drop may be accomplished.

NOTE: Area DZs are not applicable to C-17 operations except SOLL II qualified crews.
   2.5.5. Circular DZ. The size of the DZ is governed by mission requirements and usable
   terrain. The PI of a circular DZ is normally at the DZ center to allow for multiple run-in
   headings (see Figure 2.1, Option 1). For specific missions, the PI location may be adjusted to
   allow for sequential heavy equipment (HE), mass container delivery system (CDS), etc., on
   circular DZs (see Figure 2.1, Option 2). However, this limits the run-in heading to only one
   direction. In all cases, the minimum DZ dimensions for the type and number of loads being
   dropped must completely fit into the surveyed circular DZ. Refer to Figure 2.1 to determine
   whether the minimum DZ fits into the surveyed circular DZ. For cases where the PI has been
   relocated, use Figure 2.1, Option 2.

NOTE: The circular DZ size recorded on drop zone survey forms will be calculated using
Figure 2.1 Option 1. This will prevent confusion and reduce the risk of off DZ drops if the circle
center point is used as the PI.

Figure 2.1. Circular Drop Zone Computation. (The new figure correctly shows the length
of both line segment Bs to the trailing edge of the DZ.)
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                   17


Figure 2.2. Area Drop Zone. (This new figure correctly depicts an Area Drop Zone)




   2.5.6. Random Points of Impact (RPI). When mission requirements dictate, the RPI
   placement option may be used. This option may be exercised in two ways. Option One: The
   mission commander will notify the DZC at least 24 hours in advance that RPI placement will
   be used. When the standard DZ is established, the DZC will randomly select a point on the
   DZ and establish that point as the PI for the airdrop. In this case, the DZC will ensure that the
   DZ minimum size requirements for the load being dropped are met and that the entire DZ
   falls within the surveyed boundaries. Option Two: The mission commander or supported
   force commander may request the DZ established with the PI at a specific point on the DZ.
   Requests should be made at least 24 hours in advance. The requester will ensure that the
   minimum standard DZ size criteria is met for the type load being dropped and that the entire
   DZ falls within the surveyed boundaries.
   2.5.6. (AFSOC) Aircrew will ensure all PIs meet requirements listed in Table 2.2. (T-2)
   2.5.7. Multiple Points of Impact (MPI). MPI airdrops are authorized if all personnel involved
   have been properly briefed. MPI airdrops are defined as an aerial delivery method that allows
   for the calculated dispersal, both laterally and longitudinally, of airdropped loads to
   predetermined locations on a DZ. The DZ must meet the minimum size requirements for
   each PI and the precise location of each PI must be provided to aircrews (see Table 2.1 and
   Table 2.2).
   2.5.7. (AFSOC) Aircrew will ensure all PIs meet requirements listed in Table 2.2 (T-2).
       2.5.7.1. Offset PIs are computed from the surveyed center PI. When used, a 250 yard
       left/right offset will be used for 3-ship operations and a 125 yard left/right offset will be
       used for 2-ship operations. The DZ width must be increased accordingly to meet the
       distance criteria from the DZ edge to the PI. This manner of placement reduces the
       effects of wake turbulence across the DZ (see Table 2.2).

NOTE: C-17 formation personnel airdrop may require offset (laterally displaced) PIs (See Table
2.2).
   2.5.8. Simulated Airdrop Training Bundles (SATB) DZ. When conducting day/night single-
   ship or day visual formation airdrops, crews may use a 300 yard radius circular DZ. Increase
   DZ radius by 20 yards for C-130 night/station keeping equipment (SKE) formations
   conducted during VMC. SATB airdrops conducted during actual instrument meteorological
 18                                                      AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


   (IMC) conditions must follow the standard DZ size criteria for the type SATB airdrop being
   conducted. To facilitate training, SATB airdrops conducted on military
   reservations/restricted areas can use standard CDS DZ size criteria.
   2.5.8. (AFSOC) See Table 2.1 Note.
   2.5.9. Water DZ Criteria. Water DZs are normally circular and should meet the minimum
   size criteria listed in Table 2.1 and Figure 2.1. Additional restrictions are at the discretion of
   the using unit.
       2.5.9.1. DZ water depth must be a minimum of 10 feet and the area must be free of
       underwater obstructions to that depth.
       2.5.9.2. Surface must be free of floating debris or moored craft. There should be no
       protruding boulders, stumps, pilings or other hazards within 400 meters of the center of
       the DZ.

 NOTES:
  1. For lateral placement, the PI must be located at least one-half the width of the
     minimum size DZ (based upon type airdrop and airdrop formation) from the closest
     side of the DZ. EXCEPTION: C-17 personnel drops may use an offset PI of 125 or
     250 yds left/right of planned PI, depending on formation size.
  2. The PI may be located anywhere within the surveyed DZ boundaries as long as the
     minimum required DZ size for that type airdrop and airdrop formation fits within the
     boundaries, and provided the distance from the leading edge and sides is complied
     with. All participants must be briefed when using this option.
  3. JPADS guided systems PI will be the DZ centerpoint unless otherwise coordinated by
     the supported forces commander as designated supported forces authority by
     respective Division Commander


NOTE: Test and demonstration jumps may utilize water DZs with obstacles within 400 meters
of the center of the target area. This exception will not be used to allow repetitive operations into
the same DZ encompassing hazardous obstacles.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                    19


       2.5.9.3. The DZ should not be located near swift currents. For personnel drops, the
       current should not exceed 2 knots. When current speed measuring equipment is not
       available, and oceanographic/ tidal charts depict currents in excess of 2 knots, a waiver is
       required prior to the drop IAW paragraph 1.3.
       2.5.9.4. For training, sea state limits are based on the ability of recovery assets to quickly
       locate and recover jumpers and their equipment. For contingencies, sea state limits are at
       the discretion of the jumpmaster. See Attachment 2 for wind/sea state observation chart.
       2.5.9.5. Unilateral training support requirements for water DZ operations - See AFI 11-
       410.
       2.5.9.6. Approved Flotation Devices. The following guidance applies to military free-fall
       (MFF) and static line parachutists.
           2.5.9.6.1. MFF. For day or night high altitude low opening (HALO)/high altitude
           high opening (HAHO) operations, US Air Force parachutists will wear AF and/or
           MAJCOM-approved flotation devices under these circumstances: when directed by
           AFMAN 11-411(I); when the jumper's planned flight path (from exit to impact point)
           is over a water obstacle for more than half the planned flight path distance; when a
           water obstacle is within 1,000 meters of the impact point.

NOTE: A water obstacle is defined as any body of water that has a depth of four feet or more,
length and width of more than 40 feet.
           2.5.9.6.1. (AFSOC) See AFMAN 11-411 (I) for additional guidance.
           2.5.9.6.2. Static Line. USAF parachutists will wear AF and/or MAJCOM-approved
           flotation devices when a water obstacle is within 1,000 meters of the intended jumper
           dispersal pattern (CARP to DZ), or when directed by AFMAN 11-420(I).
           2.5.9.6.2. (AFSOC) See AFMAN 11-420 (I) for additional guidance.
   2.5.10. Tactical DZ. Tactical DZs are primarily used during exercises or contingencies. They
   provide the supported forces commander with a means to rapidly respond to user requests
   through the rapid survey/approval process. Tactical DZs are normally restricted to missions
   supporting actual resupply and personnel infiltration airdrops (versus proficiency jumps,
   SATBs, etc.). Tactical DZ surveys are done in an abbreviated manner, but still require a
   physical survey of the DZ, by Special Tactics (ST) combat controllers, Air Mobility Liaison
   Officer (AMLO), or the supported force, to ensure DZ suitability. A safety-of-flight review is
   also required.

NOTE: If a tactical DZ survey is done to meet new run-in axis requirements on an existing
survey, then only a safety-of-flight review is required. Tactical DZ will not be used for routine or
repetitive training.
   2.5.11. Special Purpose DZs. Special purpose DZs are only approved for use by AF special
   tactics, combat rescue officers, pararescue, and RQS assigned or supporting SERE
   Specialists. Training jumps should closely duplicate conditions that could be encountered
   during operational missions, to include rough terrain, open sea and unfamiliar or unimproved
   areas. Care will be taken to ensure that all conditions, especially safety-related are identified
   to the JM and jumpers.
 20                                                     AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


       2.5.11.1. Coordination for Use. The OG/CC, or designated representative, will
       coordinate with agencies exercising control over sites selected for use and will publish
       directives describing necessary operating instructions including hazards and restrictions.
       Guidelines for selection and use are listed below:
           2.5.11.1.1. Open Field DZ. Caution will be exercised with respect to terrain and
           obstacles such as runways, lights, high tension lines, rocky terrain, etc., that could be
           hazardous to jumpers. Hazards must not be located within 100 meters of the center of
           the DZ (Exception: When conducting runway assault operations and demonstration
           jumps).
           2.5.11.1.2. Tree Jump DZ. The criteria for selecting open field jumps apply as well to
           tree jump areas; in addition, they will be selected to be relatively free of stumps and
           dead falls. Certain trees have hazardous features such as excessive height, sloping
           branches, or no branches, and should be taken into account when selecting the DZ.
           Complete tree jump equipment will be worn when conducting intentional tree jumps.
           2.5.11.1.3. Mission DZs. The OG/CC, or designated representative, will periodically
           select unimproved and unfamiliar jump areas for the purpose of conducting
           operational mission training. Areas selected must meet the above criteria however;
           shrub brush, thickets, small trees and tundra areas are not considered hazardous to
           jumpers. Tree stumps that would be considered hazardous will not be located closer
           than 50 meters from the center of the target. Risk management must be exercised by
           the JM when conducting operational mission training and an extensive evaluation
           should be performed prior to deployment.
           2.5.11.1.4. Water DZs. Hazardous obstacles such as buoys, channel markers, piers,
           and shoreline will be at least 400 meters from the center of the target area.
2.6. Instrument Meteorological Condition Airdrops. For U.S. Army training drops, a
minimum ceiling of 200 feet above ground level (AGL) is normally required. This may be
waived by the supported forces commander/user, but must be identified before the mission is
flown. Peacetime airdrops of actual personnel or equipment for unilateral training will not be
made when weather conditions over the DZ are less than a 300 foot ceiling and one-half mile
visibility. During operational missions, ceiling and visibility minimums are at the discretion of
the supported forces commander. For joint exercises, Air Force personnel are authorized to use
Army minimums. When the ceiling is less than 600 feet AGL, clear all personnel from the DZ
NLT 5 minutes prior to the scheduled airdrop time over target (TOT) and ensure they remain
clear until completion of the airdrop.
2.7. Aerial Power Line Restrictions. For the purpose of this publication, all restrictions apply
to aerial power lines operating at 50 volts or greater.
   2.7.1. Power lines present a significant hazard to jumpers. Jumpers can sustain life
   threatening injuries from electric shock and/or falls from a collapsed canopy.
   2.7.2. To reduce this hazard, first attempt to site DZs so no power lines are located within
   1000 meters of any DZ boundary.
   2.7.3. If power lines are located within 1,000 meters of any boundary, coordinate with the
   Power Company to shut off power NLT 15 minutes prior to TOT.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                21


   2.7.4. If power cannot be interrupted, the flying mission commander, aircrew, and
   jumpmaster must conduct a risk assessment of the mission. Include as a minimum; type
   jump, jumper experience, aircrew experience, ceiling, and surface/altitude wind limits
   required to approve, suspend, or cancel the operation. To further minimize risks, consider
   altering the mission profile to raise/lower drop altitudes, change DZ run-in/escape headings,
   or remove inexperienced jumpers from the stick. If possible, mark power lines with visual
   markings (lights, smoke, or VS-17 panels).

WARNING: At no time will military personnel attempt to climb power line poles to position or
affix markings to wires or poles.
   2.7.5. During USAF MFF operations, aircrews should ensure the Jumpmaster/Team leader is
   aware when aerial power lines are within 1,000 meters of the intended PI.
   2.7.6. Non-USAF personnel will comply with their service guidance for power line
   procedures and restrictions.
2.8. Airdrop Winds. DZ wind information is critical to airdrop accuracy and is used by
aircrews to compute the adjusted release point. It is imperative that accurate and timely wind
data be transmitted to the aircrew. This includes not only surface wind and the computed mean
effective wind, but also any unusual observations (i.e., wind shear or local phenomena that could
affect wind direction, speed or restrictions to visibility).
   2.8.1. Surface Wind. The surface wind at the DZ is normally measured using an anemometer
   or other calibrated wind-measuring device. Wind direction is reported in magnetic degrees
   and wind speed in knots. The direction reported is the direction the wind is coming from.
   Surface wind limitations are listed in Table 2.3 and Table 2.4.
   2.8.1. (AFSOC) When there are contradictions between AFI 13-217 and AFI 11-231,
   Computed Air Release Point Procedures, wind limits, the AFI 13-217 wind limits tables will
   take precedence. (T-2)
   2.8.2. Mean Effective Wind. The mean effective wind (MEW) is a theoretical wind of
   constant speed and direction that extends from the ground to a designated altitude. When
   required, the DZC determines the MEW by timing the ascension of a helium-filled balloon to
   a pre-determined altitude and measuring the angle of drift. The MEW is an indicator of the
   drift line and distance an airdropped object can be expected to travel. Table 2.5 is used to
   determine average wind speed from the surface to various drop altitudes.

 NOTE: During operational missions/contingencies, the airborne commander and/or team
 leader will coordinate wind restrictions with the air mission commander/aircraft commander
 based on operational requirements.

       2.8.2.1. Inflate the 10-gram balloon with helium to a circumference of 57 inches for day
       and 74 inches for night. This increase in size at night compensates for the weight of a
       small marking light attached to the balloon.
       2.8.2.2. Two types of marking lights can be used. One type is activated by immersion in
       water prior to attachment to the balloon. The other type is commonly known as a
       chemical light and measures 6 inches in length.

NOTE: Using a chemical light other than the 6-inch size will result in inaccurate mean effective
wind measurement.
       2.8.2.3. Once the balloon is released, its ascent to the required altitude is timed. The
       ascension tables reflect the ascent times required for the balloon to reach various
       altitudes. This method is also used to estimate the base altitude of cloud layers by
       determining the ascension time for the balloon until obscured by the cloud base.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                              23


     2.8.2.4. During ascent, unusual movement by the balloon is indicative of erratic wind
     conditions and should be noted. The altitude of these occurrences, if significant, should
     be included in the MEW report to the aircraft.
     2.8.2.5. When the balloon reaches drop altitude the elevation angle is measured with a
     pocket transit, theodolite, clinometer, or any other accurate means available.
     2.8.2.6. The magnetic azimuth to the balloon is measured and the reciprocal heading
     noted. This will give the MEW wind direction.
     2.8.2.7. Referring to the scale on the left side of Table 2.5, locate the angle that
     corresponds to the angle measured. Move horizontally across the table to the vertical
     column that corresponds to the drop altitude being used. The value at the intersection of
     these two lines is the MEW wind speed in knots.
     2.8.2.8. When transmitting the MEW, make sure it is identified as the “mean effective
     wind” and the altitude to which it was taken is included. Phraseology: “TALON ZERO
     ONE, MEAN EFFECTIVE WIND AT (DROP ALTITUDE AGL), ESTIMATED
     THREE FIVE ZERO AT ONE NINER.” Indication of erratic winds or wind shear should
     be reported at that time.
  2.8.3. Altitude Winds. There are no altitude wind restrictions for fixed wing airdrops. Refer
  to the appropriate MDS-specific aircraft AFI for altitude wind restrictions for rotary wing
  aircraft. If surface winds are not provided, altitude winds may influence the jumpmaster’s
  decision to drop personnel.

2.9. Drop Zone Markings. A marked DZ is defined as a DZ that has a PI or release point
marked with a pre-coordinated visual or electronic signal. Standard DZs may be marked with
raised angle markers (RAM), VS-17 marker panels, visible lighting systems, and light beacons.
Virtually any type of lighting or visual marking system is acceptable if all participating units are
briefed and concur. Night markings or visual acquisition aids may include a light gun, flares, fire
pots, railroad fuses, flashlights, chemlights, and infrared (IR) lighting systems. Electronic
NAVAID markings (ZM, SST-181, Tactical Aid to Navigation (TACAN), etc.) may be used for
either day or night operations and placed as directed by mission requirements.
NOTE:
Ground parties and aircrews must coordinate and brief NO-DROP markings for all types of DZs.
For C-17 and C-130J operations, all Point-of-Impact (PI) coordinates, if different than planned,
must be relayed to the aircrew no later than 15 minutes prior to the TOT. If PI coordinates are
not relayed 15 minutes prior, aircrew will advise earliest TOT feasible for new coordinates.
2.10. Standard Drop Zone Markings (Not required for CSAR assigned/gained aircraft or
AFSOC assigned/gained aircraft OPCON to USSOCOM, or a theater special operations
command).
   2.10.1. During day operations, the PI will be marked with a RAM or block letter. If
   authentication is required, a block letter will be used instead of the RAM. Authorized letters
   for PI markings are A, C, J, R, and S. The block letters H and O are authorized for circular
   DZs. The block letters should be aligned with the surveyed DZ axis or with the aircraft line-
   of-flight, if different from the survey. The minimum size for block letters is 35 feet by 35 feet
   (11 meters by 11 meters) and consists of at least nine marker panels (Figure 2.3).
   2.10.2. During night operations, the PI will be marked with a block letter. The apex of the
   block letter will be located on the PI. The minimum size for block letters is 35 feet by 35 feet
   (11 meters by 11 meters) and consists of at least nine white lights, with a recommended
   minimum output rating of 15 candela. When flanker lights are used, they will be white and
   located 250 meters left and right abeam the PI, unless precluded by obstacles or obstructions.
   If 250 meters is not used the aircrew will be briefed. A trailing edge beacon may be used
   during actual personnel airdrops. When used, the amber trailing edge beacon will be placed
   along the surveyed DZ centerline 1,000 meters from the PI, or at the DZ trailing edge, which
   ever is closer to the PI. During pre-mission coordination for personnel drops, aircrews will
   identify to the DZC their trailing edge beacon requirements. For all airdrops, the DZ
   identification must be coordinated and briefed to the ground party and aircrews (Figure 2.3).
   2.10.3. IR lighting systems. When mission requirements dictate and aircrews are trained,
   equipped, and qualified, IR lights may be substituted for overt lights using the DZ marking
   patterns specified in paragraph 2.10.2.

Figure 2.3. Standard Drop Zone Markings.




2.11. Non-Standard Drop Zone Markings
   2.11.1. The tactical situation may dictate the use of nonstandard DZ markings. When
   nonstandard markings or identification procedures are used, it is imperative that all
   appropriate participants be thoroughly briefed.
   2.11.2. Unmarked DZ. This type of DZ is not authenticated with any type of visual or
   electronic marking. Unmarked DZs are normally used for contingency operations and may
   not have a DZ party present. AF Special Tactics personnel, Combat Rescue officres,
   Pararescue, RQS assigned or supporting SERE specialists, and USSOCOM assigned forces
   are authorized to drop on unmarked DZs. During training missions, a DZC party must be on
   site for safety.
   2.11.3. MFF DZ Markings. The two DZ marking systems commonly used during MFF
   operations are the wind arrow and the two-light system (Figure 2.4).
      2.11.3.1. Wind Arrow. The arrow is formed by placing visual markers on the ground in
      the shape of an arrowhead. Align the arrow pointing into the wind. Place the arrow tip
      marker on the desired impact point. Jumpers fly their approach to land facing the
      direction of the arrow.
      2.11.3.2. Two-Light System. The two-light system consists of one red light and one
      green light. The red light is placed on the desired impact point and the green light is
      placed between 15 and 50 meters downwind. Jumpers will be briefed on the actual
      separation of lights. Jumpers fly their approach to landing from green light to red light.

Figure 2.4. Military Free-Fall Drop Zone Markings.




   2.11.4. Water DZ. Water drops can be conducted on marked or unmarked DZs. Marked DZs
   will have mutually agreed upon markings (visual or electronic). Select markings that do not
   mimic local maritime navigational aids (buoys, channel markers, etc.).
      2.11.4.1. Marked Water DZ. GMRS, VIRS, CARP, or JMD (including moving target)
      procedures may be used on marked DZ. For GMRS, the position of the recovery or safety
      boat usually marks the intended release point. For water JMD drops, use moving target
      procedures (Figure 2.5). Other options may be used to mark DZ; however, these
      markings must be pre-briefed.
      2.11.4.2. Unmarked Water DZ. Unmarked water DZs will have predetermined PIs.
      Include coordinates of the PI in the aircrew, DZC and jumpmaster briefings.
   2.11.5. Single Marked Multiple Points of Impact (MPI). Single marked MPI procedures are
   authorized for Heavy Equipment/Container Delivery System (HE/CDS) airdrops where only
   the first PI in a series of MPI is marked and all personnel involved have been properly
   briefed. Single -marked MPI are restricted to along the DZ axis (no lateral displacement) and
   to a maximum of 1500 yards between the first marked PI and the last unmarked PI. The DZ
   must meet the minimum size requirements for each PI and the precise location of each PI
   must be provided to aircrews (see Table 2.1 and Table 2.2).

Figure 2.5. Jumpmaster Directed Airdrop, Moving Target Procedures.




MOVING TARGET PROCEDURES.

   1. Step 1. Head directly toward the target, regardless of the wind direction.
   2. Step 2. Release the spotter chute or wind drift indicator (WDI) directly over the target.
   3. Step 3. Immediately upon release, make a left/right hand turn (see item A) to observe the
       descent and position of the spotter chute/WDI.
   4. Step 4. Establish rectangular drop pattern oriented so the final approach will be aligned
       with the spotter chute/WDI and the target, respectively. The pattern should be adjusted so
       that the aircraft will be over the target five to nine minutes after the spotter chute/WDI is
       deployed.
   5. Step 5. Turn on approach. Make minor changes in heading to pass over the spotter
       chute/WDI and the target on a direct line. Aircraft drift correction should be established
       prior to passing over the spotter chute/WDI.
   6. Step 6. Initiate a uniform count over the spotter chute/WDI.
   7. Step 7. Reverse count over the target.
   8. Step 8. Deploy jumpers when the last digit in reverse count is reached.
   9. Step 9. After the jumper clears the aircraft, turn to observe the accuracy of the drop.
   10. Deploy additional jumpers using the drop heading and count established in steps 5, 6, and
       7.
   11. Disregard the spotter chute/WDI for subsequent passes.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                    29


Figure 2.5. Jumpmaster Directed Airdrop, Moving Target Procedures (continued).

1. When the target drift rate is changed (drogue chute is installed on target, no wind shift occurs,
etc.) the entire spotter chute/WDI procedure must be re-accomplished and a new drop heading
and count established starting with step 1.

MOVING TARGET PATTERN. Deployment procedures to a moving target are similar to
those employed for a stationary target. The moving target procedures takes into consideration
target drift and will place the team on the downdrift line of the moving target and not necessarily
on target. Special attention should be paid to the following items:

1. The pattern must be adjusted so that the initial pass over the target after spotter chute/WDI
deployment is not less than 5 minutes and not more than 9 minutes, 7 minutes being ideal. If the
initial pattern requires more than 9 minutes, the team will be too far downdrift/downwind and
with a high target drift rate may not be able to locate the target visually.

2. On the initial pass after the spotter chute/WDI deployment, an accurate count can be obtained
by the JM and the heading noted by both the JM and pilot. All subsequent passes will be made
on this initial heading using the count obtained on the first pass. No attempt should be made to
recheck the count or change the initial heading because the target will have drifted.

NOTE: On subsequent passes requiring a change of heading to place the aircraft over the target,
ensure the pilot corrects back to original heading. Moving target procedures are normally
conducted from fixed-wing aircraft.
2.12. Airdrop Communications. To the maximum extent possible, airdrop operations should
be planned to operate with minimum radio transmissions. In general, all missions are flown as
planned with additional radio calls made “by exception” only. Authentication is accomplished as
required. Detailed mission planning and pre-briefed operating procedures can eliminate many
flight-following and formation-only transmissions. Radio contact with the drop aircraft should be
limited to safety of flight requirements or issues affecting airborne force employment. This
includes ATC directions, range clearance, unsafe surface conditions or mission changes. DZ
winds or other information may be broadcast in the blind at a coordinated time prior to the
scheduled TOT.
   2.12.1. Drop clearance to a marked DZ is normally inherent with mission clearance and is
   confirmed by the aircrew observing the pre-briefed visual DZ markings. Unless radio
   communications are specifically required, any coordinated markings, other than red smoke,
   red flares, or red lights indicate a clearance to drop.

NOTE: During NVG operations colored flares may still be used, but due to the delay in aircrew
recognition of color, star clusters or other obvious signals are recommended.
   2.12.2. Training airdrops (both unilateral and joint) conducted during IMC or to an
   unmarked DZ require the DZC to relay drop clearance, (i.e., “Cleared to Drop”), to the
   aircraft by way of radio communications or other pre-briefed method. Drop clearance is
   usually accomplished a minimum of 2 minutes prior to the scheduled TOT.
 30                                                    AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


   2.12.3. Mission clearance provides drop clearance on operational missions to DZs where no
   reception party is present.
   2.12.4. No-Drop Signals. A “NO-DROP” condition, closing of the DZ, or temporary closing
   of the DZ will be indicated in one of the following ways: an authenticated radio transmission,
   red smoke, red flares, red lights, scrambled panels, or another planned signal.

NOTE: During NVG operations colored flares may still be used, but due to the delay in aircrew
recognition of color, star clusters or other obvious signals are recommended.
       2.12.4.1. A “NO-DROP” situation during IMC operations will be indicated by the
       absence of pre-briefed electronic device(s), or an authenticated radio transmission.
       2.12.4.2. Use standard no-drop signals to communicate temporary closing of a drop zone
       or postponement of an airdrop. Aircrew should follow up with a radio call to the
       appropriate C2 facility as the situation dictates.
   2.12.5. When using radio communications, the following procedures apply:
       2.12.5.1. “NO DROP” advisories should be transmitted early enough to allow time for
       authentication; specifically, not later than 1 minute prior to actual TOT, unless an
       emergency arises.
       2.12.5.2. If last minute conditions preclude a safe drop and time for proper authentication
       is not available, the DZC will immediately and repetitively transmit cancellation of drop
       clearance, “NO-DROP, NO-DROP, NO-DROP.”
   2.12.6. Authorized Relays:
       2.12.6.1. Relay operational information to the aircraft as requested when abnormal
       conditions necessitate such requests. DZCs should not be required to handle such
       messages on a regular basis.
       2.12.6.2. If necessary, inform the aircraft of the source of any messages being relayed
       (DZSO, DZC, ground forces commander, etc.).
       2.12.6.3. Transmitting the reason for an aircrew initiated “NO-DROP” is not normally
       required. However, if time permits, the aircrew will pass the information to the DZC. For
       a ground initiated “NO-DROP” (if time and security requirements permit) the DZC will
       inform the aircrew of the reason and should coordinate any further action.
       2.12.6.4. During airborne operations, the ground forces commander may need to
       determine the number of personnel who did not jump (alibi jumpers) to properly account
       for all personnel. When requested by the DZSO/DZ Support Team Leader (DZSTL), if
       the tactical situation permits, the DZC obtains the total number of jumpers remaining on
       board from the aircrew. This should not be accomplished until after the last aircraft over-
       flies the DZ and at no time if it compromises safety or conflicts with aircrew or DZC
       duties. Should such a conflict occur, delay or cancel transmissions accordingly.
   2.12.7. Unauthorized Relays. Radio calls to determine order of flight, load information, and
   administrative details are normally not authorized.
   2.12.8. Only qualified DZ personnel will operate DZ communication equipment.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                 31


2.13. Control Point Location. The DZC establishes the control point taking into account
pertinent factors such as an unobstructed line of sight, winds, positive control of the DZ,
surrounding airspace, and security requirements. Safety factors must always be considered when
choosing a control point location. During actual IMC, HV CDS or HAARS, locate the control
point off the DZ. The control point for multi-ship HE and all CDS equipment airdrops will be
offset a minimum of 300 yards (HE) and 200 yards (CDS) from the intended PI.
2.14. En Route and Terminal NAVAIDS. A variety of electronic NAVAIDS are available to
support drop zone operations including the TACAN, ZM, or radar beacons. These NAVAIDS
are utilized at the discretion of the JFACC, JFSOCC, or mission commander.
   2.14.1. For airdrops, the normal placement for NAVAIDS is as follows:
       2.14.1.1. The ZM (TPN-27) should be placed within 1,500 yards of the PI. For
       maximum accuracy, the ZM should be as close to the PI as possible. If line-of-sight
       considerations preclude placement of the ZM at the briefed location, relocate it and
       advise the aircraft on initial contact of the new location relative to the PI. During night
       airdrop operations, the ZM should be visually marked with a light to identify it as a
       hazard to parachutists and to prevent accidental destruction of the ZM by vehicular
       traffic.
       2.14.1.2. Radar Beacon Operations. Special Tactics units maintain several different radar
       beacon systems to include the SST 181, SMP 1000, and PPN-19. Pre-briefed/pre-
       coordinated beacon use is required to ensure the proper beacon at the proper setting is
       established.
           2.14.1.2.1. For CARP airdrops, compute the wind drift distance for the load being
           dropped and displace the beacons the computed distance and direction into the wind
           from the PI.
           2.14.1.2.1. (AFSOC) AFSOC may place the radar beacon at the PI when using both
           the infrared (IR) strobe and beacon on the same DZ.
           2.14.1.2.2. For high altitude airdrop operations, place radar beacons on the PI.
           Aircrews and DZC must ensure that the PI coordinates are IAW Table 2.1 high
           altitude minimum DZ size requirements. High altitude airdrop PI’s will be greater
           than Table 2.2 standard point of impact placement after Table 2.1 minimum DZ size,
           length and width adjustments are made.
           2.14.1.2.3. For MFF airdrops, the beacons will be placed on the PI.
           2.14.1.2.4. The TACAN should not be placed on a DZ as an airdrop aid.
2.15. Ground Marked Release System. When controlling an airdrop, the DZC can mark a
point on the ground with a visual signal to designate the computed Release Point (RP) to the
aircrew. This signal may be a four marker “L”, six marker “T”, or seven marker “H” and is
placed abeam, and 100 meters (110 yds) left of the desired release point as depicted in Figure
2.6. The drop is executed when the aircraft is directly abeam, and 100 meters (110 yds.) right of
this marker on the pre-briefed inbound heading. A pre-briefed code signal or beacon may be
collocated with the markers to aid in DZ identification.
 32                                                   AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


Figure 2.6. Ground Marked Release System Day and Night Markings.




   2.15.1. Marking Considerations:
      2.15.1.1. The DZ markings must be clearly visible to the aircrew on approach as early as
      possible. If conditions preclude placing the markings at the computed point, the DZC
      may have to adjust the location of the intended PI, ensuring compliance with the
      requirements in Table 2.1, Table 2.2, and Figure 2.1, Figure 2.3, Figure 2.4, Figure
      2.5. Advise both the aircrew and user of the change in PI location.
      2.15.1.2. When conducting operations requiring security, night DZ markings should be
      visible only from the direction of the aircraft’s approach. If flashlights are used, they
      should be equipped with simple hoods or shields and aimed toward the approaching
      aircraft. Omni directional lights, fires, or improvised flares may be screened on three
      sides or placed in pits with the sides sloping toward the direction of approach.
      2.15.1.3. During daylight airdrops, the marker panels should be slanted at a 45-degree
      angle from the surface toward the aircraft approach path to increase the aircrew's ability
      to see them. If security permits, smoke (other than red) may be displayed at the release
      point or corner marker to assist in aircrew DZ acquisition.
   2.15.2. Determining PI Location.
      2.15.2.1. After selecting the DZ, calculate the dispersion distance, as stated below, and
      then select a PI that is compatible with the calculated point and the tactical situation.
      Once the PI has been determined, calculate the forward throw distance and wind drift
      effect to determine the release point.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                   33


      2.15.2.2. Dispersion distance is defined as the total distance within the impact area where
      troops or cargo will land. It is in a direct line with the aircraft’s line of flight and is
      dependent upon aircraft speed and load exit time (the length of time required for the first
      through the last object to clear the aircraft). The formula for calculating dispersion is; S x
      E = L, where S = aircraft speed in knots, E = exit time in seconds, and L = length of
      dispersion in yards. This calculation is normally used to help in placing the PI, rather than
      determining the release point.
      2.15.2.3. Wind drift is defined as the lateral movement of a parachute through the air
      caused by the wind. The distance of the wind drift is measured on a direct line from the
      parachute’s fully deployed opening point to its actual point of impact on the ground. This
      drift is calculated using the formula; D = KAV, where D = drift in yards, K = the load
      drift constant, A = drop altitude in hundreds of feet) i.e., (1,000 feet = 10), and V = wind
      velocity in knots. Table 2.6 depicts the constants for different airdrop loads.
      2.15.2.4. Forward throw distance is the distance along the aircraft flight path traveled by
      a parachutist or cargo container after exiting the aircraft, until the parachute fully opens
      and the load is descending vertically (Table 2.7).

       approach (reciprocal of DZ axis).
       2.15.3.2. Pace off the distance calculated for forward travel distance. Record the position
       coordinates as a GPS markpoint/waypoint.
       2.15.3.3. Face directly into the wind. Pace off into the direction of the wind the distance
       calculated for wind drift. This is the actual release point
       2.15.3.4. Face into the direction from which the aircraft will approach (reciprocal of DZ
       axis), turn 90 degrees to the right and pace off 100 meters (110 yards for the offset).
       Place the corner or first panel at this point.
       2.15.3.5. Adjust the release point for wind direction/velocity changes by returning to
       GPS markpoint/waypoint and following steps 2.15.3.3 and 2.15.3.4 above.
       2.15.3.6. Establish the ground markings as shown in Figure 2.6.
2.16. Verbal Initiated Release System. CCT, pararescue, and battlefield weather personnel use
this procedure when normal drop procedures are not tactically feasible. The ground party
determines the desired release point, gives verbal steering guidance to the pilot to align the
aircraft over that point, and then initiates the release. Instructions transmitted to the aircraft must
be concise.
   2.16.1. Transmit “Turn Left” or “Turn Right” to align aircraft on desired inbound heading.
   2.16.2. Transmit “Stop Turn” after alignment instructions when aircraft is on course.
   2.16.3. Transmit “Standby” to the aircraft approximately 5 seconds prior to the release point.
   2.16.4. Transmit “Execute, Execute, Execute” when the aircraft reaches the release point.
   Upon hearing the first "Execute", the navigator/pilot not flying calls "Green Light."
2.17. Drop Zone Personnel. The DZ Controller (DZC) is normally a USAF combat controller
(E-4 or above with a five skill level or higher) certified by the unit commander. Combat
controllers are authorized to control all airdrops for any US or allied military force.

NOTE: Combat Rescue Officers, Pararescue, RQS assigned or supporting SERE Specialists, and
Battlefield Weather personnel are authorized to act as DZC for unilateral AF and foreign national
rescue operations in which Pararescue is the controlling agency. DZC training and certification
for rescue parachute deployments may be accomplished by qualified Pararescue trainers/task
certifiers and certified by letter by the unit commander.
   2.17.1. The primary method of certification is to complete the HQ AFSOC DZC formal
   lesson plan and instruction by a qualified combat controller, qualified AMLO, DZC certified
   rated officer aircrew member, unit certified DZC personnel, or a sister service Drop Zone
   Support Team (DZST) IAW 2.17.4. All Air Force DZCs, other than combat control
   personnel and AMLOs, will be trained to attain proficiency (academic training and practical
   training involving day and night DZ operations) in DZC responsibilities, duties, and DZ
   establishment as outlined in this instruction and operations support squadron training
   procedures. Certification will be validated in a memorandum signed by the operations group
   commander (OG/CC) and maintained at the group tactics office. Air Force aircrew members
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                35


   functioning as DZCs are restricted to a 12-hour duty day waiverable to 16 hours by the
   OG/CC or higher (not applicable to AFRC crewmembers). AMLOs deployed/attached in
   support of US Army units get duty-day extensions from supported forces commander or as
   designated supported forces authority by respective Division Commander. The alternate
   method of DZC certification is to complete the training IAW the HQ AFSOC lesson plan
   provided by a qualified combat controller. However, due to the high ops tempo of special
   tactics teams, scheduling training through a special tactics squadron may require extensive
   lead time between the coordination process and the actual training commence date. The HQ
   AFSOC DZC lesson plan can be accessed through a link on the AMC/A3D – Combat
   Operations web-site at: https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a39/a39.htm.

NOTE: Authorized personnel, other than qualified combat controllers, qualified AMLOs and
DZC certified rated officer aircrew members, are restricted to formation airdrops of four or less
aircraft unless on a military range with active range control.
   2.17.2. USAF personnel other than ST.
       2.17.2.1. Air Mobility Liaison Officers (AMLO). AMLOs qualified IAW AMCI 13-101,
       Air Mobility Liaison Officers, are authorized to control airdrops for any U.S., allied or
       coalition military force.
       2.17.2.2. The OG/CC may approve active duty, ANG, AFRC members, and civilian
       contract personnel to perform DZC duties during unilateral training airdrops. The OG/CC
       should utilize air operations oriented personnel to act as DZCs. Although not all
       encompassing, aircrew, tactical air control party (TACP), battlefield weather personnel,
       air traffic control, aerial delivery support, pararescue, and jumpmasters (currently on
       jump status) are some of the AF specialties/qualifications that are routinely involved in
       air operations. See MAJCOM guidance for additional DZC eligibility and restriction
       criteria. Individuals may be certified after completion of the required training listed in
       paragraph 2.17.1.

NOTE: Properly trained USAFWS Weapons Officer airlift cadre may perform DZC duties at all
approved CONUS DZs. These personnel assume DZCO and DZSO responsibilities listed in 2.18
and 2.19. Weapons Officers will receive HQ AFSOC formal training from a 7-level combat
controller (preferred) or training from any appropriately trained DZC IAW para 2.17.1.
   2.17.3. Other DoD Authorized DZC Personnel.
       2.17.3.1. Civilian contract personnel must complete the HQ AFSOC formal lesson plan
       and receive instruction IAW paragraph 2.17.1 before they are authorized to control
       airdrop operations.
       2.17.3.2. U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) units. In addition to Air Force
       ST units, the following USSOCOM units have qualified personnel that may perform
       DZC duties during joint and unilateral USSOCOM training.
           2.17.3.2.1. U.S. Navy Sea Air Land teams and Explosive Ordinance Disposal units.
           2.17.3.2.2. U.S. Army Special Forces and Rangers.
 36                                                     AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


   2.17.4. Drop Zone Support Team (DZST) Personnel. DZSTs are qualified IAW the
   Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), “Airdrop Operations Without Air Force Combat
   Control,” and unit standard operating procedures implementing this MOA.
       2.17.4.1. U.S. Army/Marine Corps DZST personnel may perform DZC duties during
       joint and unilateral Air Force training airdrops.
       2.17.4.2. DZST controlled missions must have a qualified Drop Zone Support Team
       Leader (DZSTL) in charge of DZ operations.
   2.17.5. Non-USAF / Non-aircrew personnel. If combined exercises or contingency
   operations require USAF use of drop zones not defined within the scope of this AFI, or under
   the operational control of non-USAF / non-aircrew personnel, a combat controller or AMLO
   may train allied forces personnel (with ACC or DIRMOBFOR approval) to perform DZC
   duties IAW paragraph 2.18 of this instruction using approved HQ AFSOC formal lesson
   plans. The instructor will provide a letter certifying personnel to perform DZC duties limited
   to the drop zone trained on for a specified duration.
2.18. Drop Zone Controller Responsibilities.
   2.18.1. The DZC represents the appropriate commander as provided in the mission directive.
   2.18.2. The DZC ensures that adequate medical and evacuation coverage is available prior to
   personnel airdrops.
   2.18.3. The DZC observes and evaluates:
       2.18.3.1. All factors that may adversely affect the safety of the operation and ensures
       transmission of weather information when required.
       2.18.3.2. Condition of the DZ prior to the airdrop.
       2.18.3.3. Placement of personnel and equipment on the DZ. Only designated vehicles
       and personnel will remain on the DZ. Recovery and medical personnel and equipment
       must be positioned so that constant contact is maintained with the DZC. During joint
       operations, the DZC and the DZSO are responsible for their respective equipment and
       personnel.

NOTE: For actual equipment or personnel airdrops, if the ceiling is less than 600 feet, direct all
personnel and equipment off the DZ to ensure safety.
       2.18.3.4. The operation of other aircraft that could endanger the drop aircraft, equipment
       load, or parachutists.
       2.18.3.5. The DZC should have immediate access to ground-to-air communications
       equipment or sufficient signaling aids to operate the DZ. Ground-to-air communication is
       required for IMC airdrops.
       2.18.3.6. The DZC insures non-DZC personnel are aware of the “NO DROP” signal in
       order to prevent an inadvertent signal to the aircraft.
   2.18.4. In the event conditions are unsafe for airdrop operations, the DZC ensures that:
       2.18.4.1. "NO DROP” signals are displayed on the DZ.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                  37


       2.18.4.2. “NO DROP” or drop cancellation information is transmitted to the aircraft (see
       paragraphs 2.12.4 and 2.12.5).
       2.18.4.3. A drop is canceled when advised by the DZSO. During a joint mission, the
       DZSO is responsible for evaluating the winds and surface conditions for an airdrop
       operation. When only AF personnel are involved, it is the responsibility of the DZC to
       cancel the airdrop when conditions are unsafe.
       2.18.4.4. Ensures necessary reports to include AF Form 4304, Drop Zone / Landing Zone
       Control Log (Attachment 7), are properly filled out and submitted to the appropriate
       agencies.
2.19. Drop Zone Safety Officer. During training operations, the airdropped force furnishes the
Drop Zone Safety Officer (DZSO) who in turn is responsible for the following functions
(DZC/DZSO duties may be combined during unilateral USAF operations):
   2.19.1. Ensuring adequate medical coverage is available at the DZ prior to any personnel
   drops. The supported unit normally provides medical coverage for itself and Air Force
   parachutists during joint operations.
   2.19.2. Clearing the DZ of all personnel and equipment not required for control.
   2.19.3. Determining when surface conditions (i.e., winds, vehicles, etc.) on the DZ are
   hazardous to airborne operations, making the decision to proceed with, suspend or cancel
   airdrops, and informing the DZC not later than 2 minutes prior to the drop. Airdrops are not
   suspended or canceled based solely on aircraft alignment with the DZ.
   2.19.4. Coordinating all no-drop actions with the DZC.
   2.19.5. Ensures the conditions of the DZ will not affect operations or recovery of air items.
   2.19.6. Ensures the DZ meets operational and safety criteria for the type airdrop operations
   being conducted.
2.20. Drop Zone Scoring. Drop scoring is the responsibility of the DZC.
   2.20.1. Strike Reports. The strike report reflects the circular error (CE) or the distance that
   the first object (or parachutist) lands from the PI. Strike reports are given in yards or meters
   and relative clock position from the PI with 12 o’clock as the relative DZ axis heading.
       2.20.1.1. Score object impacting within a 25-yard radius of the PI as a “PI”.
       2.20.1.2. Score the accuracy of mass airdrops during joint training, exercises, SOF
       standardization / evaluations, and high velocity airdrops as “Satisfactory” if 90 percent or
       more of all airdropped personnel or equipment lands within the boundaries of the DZ.
       Score these drops as “Unsatisfactory” if less than 90 percent lands within these
       boundaries. Mass airdrops for personnel are considered approximately brigade size or
       larger. Both personnel and equipment airdrops may be scored using mass airdrop criteria
       if the accuracy is indeterminable.
 38                                                     AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


       2.20.1.3. MFF Airdrops. Do not score MFF airdrops. Annotate actual TOTs and
       information relevant to any mishap or off-DZ drops.
NOTE:
Waivered DZ drops are scored based on the AF minimum DZ size criteria. For example, a
waivered DZ is 100 yards short of AF minimum size. The drop is considered on the DZ if
personnel/ equipment land within the 100-yard difference between the minimum and wavered
DZ boundaries.
       2.20.1.3. (AFSOC) Aircrew conducting MFF training operations will coordinate with
       drop zone control personnel to obtain drop scores after each pass in order to make any
       necessary adjustments to follow-on passes. Crews will pass this information to
       jumpmasters for considerations prior to each subsequent pass. Crews will also ensure
       that all jumpers have landed safely within the surveyed drop zone. (T-2)
   2.20.2. Scoring Methods. There are three methods to score airdrops, and they are listed by
   preference.

NOTE: Score only the first load/parachutist exiting from each aircraft.
   2.20.2. (AFSOC) Note: When dropping multiple CDS bundles the crew will notify the DZ
   control party to score either the first bundle exiting the aircraft or the middle bundle in the
   stick. (T-3)
       2.20.2.1. Measuring. The distance from the PI to the load is measured when precise
       scores are required. The distance is measured using a precision measuring device
       (odometer, laser range finders, pre-measured length of cord, measuring tapes, cyclometer,
       GPS, etc.).
       2.20.2.2. Pacing. Score is measured by physically pacing the distance from the PI to the
       place where the parachutist or equipment load landed.
       2.20.2.3. Estimating. Used when there is insufficient time or personnel to pace. The
       distance from the PI to the load is visually estimated. To assist in scoring by this method,
       markers (visible from the PI) may be placed at desired locations from the PI at the 3, 6, 9,
       and 12 o’clock positions. If the markers are used, indicate this to the aircrew.
2.21. Off Drop Zone Reporting Procedures. In addition to the paragraphs below, users will
refer to AFJ 13-210(I), Joint Airdrop Inspection Records, Malfunction Investigations, and
Activity Reporting.
   2.21.1. When an off DZ airdrop has been confirmed or suspected, the aircrew involved will
   not attempt another drop for the remainder of the mission. In the case of an off DZ drop
   involving injury or death to personnel, the mission will be terminated and the aircraft will
   land as soon as possible. Retain all paperwork involved in the flight to aid in the
   investigation. Aircrews will immediately report information regarding off DZ airdrops to a
   USAF Command Post. Unit safety offices will be notified as soon as possible. Off DZ
   mishaps resulting in death or serious injury shall be referred to safety and accident
   investigation boards convened under the appropriate regulations.
       2.21.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) For MFF operations involving jumpers from special
       operations forces (SOF) units where aircrew and the jumpmaster have prebriefed
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                 39


     potential alternate landing sites, jumpers landing off the primary DZ potentially do not
     constitute an off DZ drop as defined by AFI 13-217. Drops may continue provided all of
     the following items apply (T-2):
         2.21.1.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) No injured personnel or aircraft damage.
         2.21.1.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) 100% accountability of jumpers.
         2.21.1.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) DZSO relays off primary DZ landing was due solely
         to jumper error or election, after confirming with the jumpers.
         2.21.1.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) Jumpmaster, DZSO, and the aircraft commander
         concur with decision to continue MFF operations. If the jumpmaster, DZSO, or
         aircraft commander do not agree that the requirements of Paragraphs 2.21.1.1.1-
         2.21.1.1.3 are met, follow procedures in AFI 13-217, Paragraph 2.21.
         2.21.1.1.5. (Added-AFSOC) The squadron and operations group commanders will
         be notified of aircrew’s intent to continue airdrop operations. (T-2)
  2.21.2. Units with DZC/DZSO/DZST responsibilities will develop local procedures and
  communications processes to obtain emergency assistance to preserve life and limb, secure
  the site, and notify the airlift and user's chain of command. The first notification step should
  be through the airdrop aircraft for relay to a USAF command post. Alternative means may
  include relay through any local US military installation. Local installations may also be able
  to assist with emergency response resources including, aircraft rescue and fire fighting, law
  enforcement, and public affairs.
     2.21.2.1. Wings/operations groups will develop guidance for aircrews and DZ personnel
     for the capture and reporting of in-flight data relating to an off-DZ airdrop and/or airdrop
     malfunction. This data must have enough detail to re-create the circumstances
     surrounding the incident for the aerial delivery review panel. Accurate and timely capture
     of data is critical and is the responsibility of the aircraft commander.
     2.21.2.2. Aircrews involved in an airdrop malfunction will not attempt another drop for
     the remainder of the mission until approved by the unit’s OG/CC, DIRMOBFOR, or
     USAF base OG/CC with airdrop expertise from which the mission was launched and
     returned.
  2.21.3. The aircrew’s OG/CC, or equivalent, shall appoint an aerial delivery review panel to
  investigate all off DZ airdrops. However, when performing off-station airdrop missions at an
  Air Force Base with airdrop expertise (e.g. Pope AFB), the aircrew’s OG/CC may authorize
  the host unit OG/CC to perform the aerial delivery review panel IAW paragraph 2.21.5.
  Panel members should include the Operations Support Squadron (OSS) chief of tactics
  (chairperson); a tactics pilot, navigator, and loadmaster; a stan/eval pilot, navigator, and
  loadmaster; airdrop inspector loadmaster, flying safety officer, and crewmembers from the
  incident. The chairperson may modify panel composition based on the nature of the situation
  under review.
  2.21.4. The Flying Safety Officer will determine if the airdrop incident is reportable in
  accordance with AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. The aerial delivery review
  panel will be prepared to provide information requested for a safety investigation and report,
  if warranted. Normally, the Air Force reports injuries and damage to their own personnel and
 40                                                     AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


   equipment. Other military services report injuries and damage to their own personnel and
   equipment. The Air Force takes part in these investigations when requested by the other
   service.
   2.21.5. Convene an aerial delivery review panel no later than the next duty day after the
   airdrop if the incident occurs in the local area. However, if the incident occurs away from
   home station at a location without Air Force airdrop expertise, convene the panel within 5
   duty days (10 days for ANG and AFRC units) after the aircrew returns to home station. The
   unit’s OG/CC is the approval authority to allow aircrew to continue airdrop operations away
   from home station at a location without USAF airdrop expertise. Unit commanders will
   ensure aircrew members involved in an off DZ airdrop are not scheduled for any event that
   would delay convening an aerial delivery review panel or for another airdrop until the
   incident is resolved. Upon completion of the aerial delivery review panel, the chairperson
   will submit recommendations to the OG/CC; if the option listed in paragraph 2.21.3 is used,
   then the host unit OG/CC will inform the aircrew’s OG/CC of the panel’s recommendations.
   The OG/CC will make the final determination regarding any panel recommended actions.
      2.21.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) Aerial Delivery Review Panel (ADRP) for MFF Off-DZ
      Drops. If MFF operations are continued after an off-DZ drop IAW Paragraph 2.21.1.1,
      an ADRP and all reporting requirements are still required and will be accomplished in
      accordance with AFI 13217 after mission termination. (T-2)
   2.21.6. HQ AMC/A3DT will be the repository for all Air Force off DZ reports. AMC units
   will send the results of their delivery review panel by memorandum, message, or e-mail to
   HQ AMC/A3DT within three duty days after the panel convenes. Non-AMC units will
   forward their report to AMC/ DOKT through their MAJCOMs NLT 30 calendar days after
   the incident. If the aerial delivery review panel judges the incident to be of immediate interest
   to other airdrop units, send an immediate message outlining significant details and
   recommendations to HQ AMC/A3DT with an information copy to the parent numbered Air
   Force (NAF).
   2.21.7. As a minimum, the delivery review panel results will include the following
   information in their final report: date of incident, type aircraft, unit, type load, DZ name and
   location, type drop (SKE, Visual, or Computer Drop), day/night, formation position, drop
   score (clock position and distance), and surface winds. The report will also include causes
   and recommendations.
2.22. Drop Zone Surveys.
   2.22.1. USAF aircrews require a DZ survey for training airdrop missions involving US
   personnel and/or equipment. Completing the DZ survey process involves both a physical
   inspection of the DZ, and documenting the information on AF IMT 3823, Drop Zone Survey.
   Surveys may be accomplished by the unit whose equipment or personnel are being
   airdropped. For exercises and joint training operations, users must ensure the survey is
   completed and meets the appropriate criteria for operational and safety standards. If
   requesting ST combat controllers to conduct the survey IAW paragraph 1.4 the user should
   identify this requirement during the initial planning conference but no later than the middle
   planning conference. The user must conduct a physical inspection of the DZ prior to use to
   identify and evaluate potential hazards to airdropped personnel/equipment, man-made or
   natural structures, and ground personnel. The nearest group tactics office will perform the
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                  41


  safety-of-flight review to ensure there are no obstructions prohibiting over-flight. If the
  survey was conducted using any other method than GPS-derived coordinates, provide the
  safety-of-flight reviewer with the raw coordinate data and the method of conversion. If a DZ
  survey is done on an existing surveyed DZ to meet new run-in axis requirements for a
  particular mission, only a safety-of-flight review is required.
     2.22.1.1. Host Nation (HN) DZ Surveys. When dropping HN military jumpers and/or
     equipment on a HN surveyed DZ, the mission can be performed using only a safety-of-
     flight review (see 2.22.1.2 below) of the HN survey. Users remain responsible for ground
     operational and safety criteria IAW 2.22.1 above. However, when US personnel and
     equipment are airdropped, HN surveys will not be used in lieu of a survey completed by
     US forces IAW survey procedures outlined in paragraph 2.22.
     2.22.1.2. Safety-of-Flight Review. A safety-of-flight review is completed by the nearest
     Air Force wing/group tactics office on all DZ surveys. During contingency operations,
     the safety of flight review may be accomplished by the tactics office in the Air Mobility
     Division (AMD) / AOC. The purpose of a safety-of-flight review is to ensure an aircraft
     can safely ingress and egress the DZ. A safety-of-flight review includes an in-depth chart
     study of the terrain features along the route of flight from the IP to a distance of
     approximately 4 nautical miles past the DZ trailing edge. For a complete list of Regional
     Group/Wing                       Tactics                    offices                   see:
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AM-40.
     2.22.1.2. (AFSOC) Replace link to regional group/wing tactics offices with:
     https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AM-40/default.aspx.Error! Hyperlink reference not
     valid.
         2.22.1.2.1. A 1:50,000-scale chart and satellite imagery (if available) should be used
         when available for the objective area and at least a 1:250,000-scale chart for the run-
         in and escape. If approved by the MAJCOM, Portable Flight Planning Software
         (PFPS) may be used instead of paper charts. The safety-of-flight review lists (Block
         11 of AF IMT Form 3823 IAW Attachment 4 paragraph A4.1.11) all obstructions
         such as terrain, towers, or power lines that may affect the aircraft’s ability to achieve
         drop altitude and airspeed. Also listed on the safety-of-flight review are any
         prohibited areas, noise sensitive areas, special use airspace, route of flight to avoid
         such areas, preferred routing, Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) requirements, etc.
         Evaluation of terrain/ obstructions should include service ceiling and climb
         performance for the particular aircraft involved, the ability of the aircraft to fly over
         the DZ at slow speeds and escape from the DZ using three-engine climb out rates. If
         these criteria cannot be met, the run-in must be modified, drop altitude raised, or the
         safety-of-flight review denied.
         2.22.1.2.1. (AFSOC) AFSOC crews may use PFPS for conducting safety of flight
         reviews. If obstacles/hazards, local area restrictions, or other concerns (i.e., airspace)
         exist in the vicinity of a DZ that would prevent random approaches for MFF
         operations, clearly annotate allowable sectors in the remarks section of the survey
         (e.g., “due to local area restrictions both north and south of the DZ, MFF random
         approaches are restricted to easterly or westerly run-ins [070-110/250-290]”). (T-2)

   2.22.2. When conducting operations on a DZ that was previously surveyed by another unit,
   the commander of the using unit is responsible for ensuring the DZ meets the criteria for that
   operation. In all cases, the using unit must accept responsibility for all personnel injuries,
   parachute or load damage, and property damage occurring on the DZ.
   2.22.3. Tactical DZ Surveys. During exercises and contingencies, when time or situation do
   not permit completion of a full DZ survey, a tactical DZ survey may be required to support
   highly mobile ground forces.
       2.22.3.1. Though preferable, the use of an AF IMT 3823, Drop Zone Survey, is not
       required for a tactical survey. Requests and surveys may be passed electronically. As
       much information as practical should be obtained and forwarded for review.
       2.22.3.2. Requests for tactical surveys will be forwarded to the designated
       exercise/contingency airlift or special operations component senior representative for
       final review.
       2.22.3.3. When using a tactical DZ, the airlift unit assumes responsibility for aircraft
       safety-of-flight and the receiving unit assumes responsibility for injury to personnel or
       damage to equipment/air items. The DZ size should be determined by the mode of
       delivery, load dispersal, and discussion with receiving unit regarding air item
       recoverability and load survivability.
   2.22.4. Parachute Demonstration Team DZ Surveys. The Air Force “Wings of Blue” and
   MAJCOM sponsored parachute demonstrations do not require a formal DZ survey for public
   affairs coordinated high altitude low opening (HALO) precision parachute demonstrations
   using Air Force aircraft. It is the responsibility of the demonstration team leader/jumpmaster
   to ensure all service, FAA, and hosting organization requirements are met on and around the
   DZ. It is the responsibility of the flying unit to ensure flight safety will not be compromised
   and that applicable NOTAMs are filed with the FAA. It is the responsibility of both the
   flying unit and the demonstration team leader/jump-master to ensure all aspects of the
   planned operation are briefed and understood by all parties involved.
   2.22.4. (AFSOC) The following parachute demonstration teams are considered MAJCOM
   sponsored and thus do not require a formal DZ survey for public affairs-coordinated HALO
   precision parachute demonstrations using AFSOC aircraft: US Army “Golden Knights,” US
   Navy “Leap Frogs,” US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) “Para-Commandos.”
2.23. Drop Zone Review Process. The following paragraphs outline the DZ review process
from performing the initial groundwork to the final incorporation of the DZ into the ZAR. Use of
the ZAR will expedite mission planning, enhance safety, and avoid duplication of surveys.
Information in the ZAR does not replace the need for a completed survey prior to conducting
drop zone operations. All completed surveys will be forwarded by the appropriate agencies to
HQ AMC/A3DT for inclusion in the worldwide ZAR database.
NOTE:
DZ surveys become obsolete 5-years after the date of MAJCOM approval (block 4E on AF Form
3822) and must be resurveyed prior to use. Surveys will also be reaccomplished when the user
and/or airlift provider determines changes in the ground or air aspects of the DZ data require a
new survey.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                 43


Other MAJCOMs and contingency AOCs may maintain their own ZAR database (if desired).
However, this does not alleviate them of the responsibility to provide these surveys to HQ
AMC/A3DT for inclusion in the worldwide ZAR database, unless classification requirements
dictate otherwise.
   2.23.1. The surveyor (AF IMT 3823, item 4A2) performs the actual ground portion of the
   DZ survey (i.e., measurements, coordinates, calculating size, obtaining maps and creating
   diagrams) and annotates results on the AF IMT 3823 . The surveyor may be a member of the
   unit that intends to use the DZ, a member of another unit, or a qualified civilian. A qualified
   civilian may be a GS employee, contractor, and/or temporary contractor hired by DoD to
   perform survey specific duties. All civilian qualified members will be trained IAW the
   current AFSOC survey training guidance. All surveyors must be capable of performing the
   required survey duties and be familiar with equipment and data computations necessary to
   complete the survey in order to ensure survey accuracy. To facilitate future use of surveyed
   DZs, initial surveys will encompass the largest area available and will not be limited by
   specific mission requirements. The surveyor will forward the completed survey to the ground
   operations review authority. Include recommended use, any deviations from DZ standards
   contained in service or MAJCOM directives, and other pertinent remarks. Throughout the
   review process, DZ survey packages will include all applicable maps, photos, charts and
   diagrams necessary to determine the safety and utility of the DZ.
NOTE:
Interested users may contact the Combat Control School, DSN 424-1406, to obtain slots in the
Survey Course. Slots will be on a space-available basis to all non-CCT personnel.
   2.23.2. The ground operations review authority (AF IMT 3823, item 4C) is normally the
   surveyor’s commander or designated representative. This review ensures the survey form is
   complete, accurate, and the DZ meets the criteria for planned ground operations.
   2.23.3. The safety-of-flight reviewer (AF IMT 3823, item 4D) performs the safety-of-flight
   review ensuring that the DZ can be safely used from a flight perspective. The safety-of-flight
   review is completed by the chief, group tactics, or as assigned by the OG/CC or equivalent.
   2.23.3. (AFSOC) Safety-of-flight reviewer in order of preference is the group tactics office;
   group stan/eval office, squadron operations officer or their representative.
   2.23.4. Air Operations Approval. (AF IMT 3823, item 4E). Prior to use, surveys will be
   approved for air operations by the OG/CC or the appropriate ACC, respectively. This
   approval assures that the safety-of-flight review has been accomplished and the DZ is
   considered safe for air operations.
   2.23.5. Once item 4E of the AF IMT 3823 is completed, the survey is ready for use. All
   completed surveys will be forwarded to HQ AMC/A3DT, 402 Scott Drive, Unit 3A1, Scott
   AFB, IL 62225-5302, to maintain the most current data in the ZAR database. Respective
   group tactics offices are the local area repositories for DZ surveys.

  2.23.5. (AFSOC) Once item 4C and 4D are signed, AFSOC, 193 SOW, 919 SOW and 24
  SOW units may commence operations without the signature in box 4E. If item 4E is not
  signed, the survey will be restricted in the “remarks” section as “For US Special Operations
  Forces Use Only.” This applies to aircrew and jumpers. If a Joint Special Operations Air
  Component (JSOAC) or Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) is established, the
  JSOAC/CC or JSOTF/CC may sign item 4E for inclusion in the Air Mobility Command
  (AMC) ZAR database (T-2).
  2.23.6. DZ surveys document the conditions that existed at the time the survey was
  accomplished. Recommended uses may be based on minimum requirements and should not
  be misconstrued to be all-inclusive; (i.e., a DZ recommended for personnel may be suitable
  for a single parachutist but not for 15, or it may be suitable for a C-130 but not a C-17). It is
  the responsibility of the supporting force and supported forces involved to ensure that any
  DZ being considered for use meets the requirements for their specific operation.

                               LANDING ZONE OPERATIONS

Section 3A—Landing Zone Operations

3.1. General. There are two types of airland operations that provide transportation within a
theater or joint operations area. Routine air movement is usually unopposed and uses secure
airfields or well-established landing zones (LZ); the majority of these missions involve the
administrative airlift of troops and equipment. Certain phases of any airlift operation, or the
entire operation, may be accomplished by air-landing troops and equipment directly into the
objective area. Combat control personnel normally provide landing zone surveys.
NOTE:
Combat controllers are authorized to use night vision goggles while controlling aircraft in
terminal areas. Pararescue, combat rescue officers, battlefield weather personnel and
crewmembers are authorized to use night vision goggles for marshalling of aircraft in terminal
areas if trained and certified in the procedure.
Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, the U-28A will follow the criteria identified for C-130
Operations.
3.2. Airlift Mission Commander Responsibilities. The airlift mission commander selects the
air tactics and designs the flow of air movement to comply with the delivery requirements. The
airlift mission commander establishes control through combat control personnel of all air traffic
movement (traffic pattern, landing, taxi, parking, and takeoff) at Air Force operated LZs.
3.3. Landing Zone Selection. The ACC with the other component commanders and the joint
force engineer determine the most suitable locations. JFSOCC forces determine their suitable
locations from JSOACC recommendations. In all cases, selected sites must meet AF operational
requirements, ground component requirements, and construction requirements.
3.4. Landing Zone Classification. The following general data is intended to correlate the
Army airfield classification system with the Air Force classification system. The correlation of
these airfields may not be exact and specifications are dependent upon aircraft gross weight,
utilization of aircraft arresting equipment, criteria for the particular instrument approach planned,
and model and type of aircraft.
3.4. (AFSOC)Landing Zone Classification. AFSOC, 193 SOW, and 919 SOW crews may
conduct air land operations at airfields that have: 1) approved LZ surveys; 2) landing zones
found in appropriate Flight Information Planning (FLIP) products (IFR, VFR supplements,
instrument approach procedures); or 3) favorable listings in AMC airfield suitability and
restrictions report for similar type or larger aircraft. After considering operating length,
runway/taxiway widths, weight bearing capacity, and host nation aircraft-type operations, etc.;
Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) group/CC’s may authorize (in writing)
landings at airfields not covered by items 1, 2, or 3 in this paragraph. For all operations, landing
zones/runways must meet AFSOC minimum requirements for the mission design series aircraft
used. Crews will complete a detailed safety of flight review prior to commencing operations.

   3.4.1. Air Force airfields are usually constructed to standards that are based primarily on the
   expected life of the airfield.
       3.4.1.1. Expedient airfields are those surfaced with dirt, membrane, landing mat, or any
       combination of these.
       3.4.1.2. The criteria in AFJPAM 32-8013, Volume II (FM 5-430-00-2), Planning and
       Design of Roads, Airfields and Heliports in the Theater of Operations - Airfield and
       Heliport Design, outlines construction criteria of airfields for aircraft operating under
       normal conditions and procedures. Combat control personnel are trained to perform
       tactical LZ surveys or assessments in support of airlift operations. They determine LZ
       suitability by using general criteria in AFJPAM 32-8013, Volume II (FM 5-430-00-2),
       and the specific tactical LZ criteria contained in MAJCOM supplements to this
       instruction. Table 3.1 shows the general peacetime minimum sizes for various USAF
       fixed-wing LZs. These LZs are based upon required use of maximum effort take-off/
       landing procedures by arriving/departing aircraft. These procedures are defined by
       applicable aircraft operating manuals.

4. Waiverable to computed ground roll plus (+) 500 ft by the MAJCOM/A3 or DIRMOBFOR



       3.4.1.2. (AFSOC) The term “Light Tactical Fixed-Wing” refers to fixed-wing aircraft
       smaller than C-130 (e.g., C-145A, C-146A, and PC-12). Survey potential LZs that do not
       meet minimum C-130 criteria to accommodate the largest possible LTFW category.
       AFSOC Table 3.3 lists the minimum LZ dimensions for LTFW categories. Potential
       LZs that cannot accommodate the dimensions for a generic LTFW category may be
       surveyed for a specific aircraft’s criteria (i.e., C-145A), however this may restrict use by
       other aircraft types and should be avoided whenever possible. Specific tactical LZ

Notes:
1. Maximize semi-prepared runway widths to allow LZ controllers/pilots to offset landing points and
reduce surface rutting on semi-prepared surfaces. If vertical obstacles exist near the edge of a
paved/prepared surface, reduce the published width to place these obstacles outside the A/B zones of
the surveyed LZ. (T-2)
2. Runway length should be as long as possible to accommodate multiple aircraft types and potential
need for displaced threshold for various glide slope ratio requirements. (T-2)

       3.4.1.3. Airfield construction is generally done following the guidelines in AFJPAM 32-
       8013, Volume II (FM 5-430-00-2). However, criteria to be utilized in a specific theater of
       operations is based on local conditions and determined by Army and Air Force staff
       engineers acting for the joint force commander.
   3.4.2. Potential LZ areas fall into two basic categories: prepared, and semi-prepared
   (unpaved). Prepared areas may include existing airfields, roads, highways, or other paved
   surfaces. Semi-prepared surfaces are natural areas such as deserts, dry lakebeds, and flat
   valley floors. These surfaces offer the ability to construct short airstrips for a limited use and
   may or may not have an aggregate surface.
   3.4.3. Contingency Response Group (CRG) airfield assessment teams include Air Force
   Civil Engineering Support Activity (AFCESA) personnel that are qualified to conduct
   surveys of prepared and semi-prepared LZs.
   3.4.4. Combat control personnel are trained and equipped with a full suite of surveying
   equipment that can satisfactorily assess obstructions, penetrations, and approach zone
   clearances. They are also trained and have equipment used to check weight-bearing
   capability of LZs for both semi-prepared and prepared surfaces.

NOTE: Although qualified combat control personnel can establish usability of hard-surface LZs
for temporary operations, it is recommended that Air Force Civil Engineering Support Activity
(AFCESA) or some other dedicated civil engineering agency with more robust equipment
(Electronic Cone Penetrometer, Heavy Weight Deflectometer, etc.) be utilized for sustained
operations. AFCESA contact information can be found in any Engineering Technical Letter.
   3.4.5. Combat control personnel who are graduates of the AFCESA Contingency Airfield
   Pavement Evaluation Course are qualified to perform structural evaluations of all types of
   pavement surfaces (hard or un-surfaced) and determine allowable number of passes and
   maximum weights of aircraft that can safely use these surfaces. When results of these
   structural evaluations exhibit uncharacteristic results, these personnel are trained to forward
   the data to the MAJCOM pavement engineer for final determination.
   3.4.6. Although combat controllers and AMLOs are not qualified to perform engineering
   surveys, they may be required to assist the supporting forces commander as a designated
   representative in selecting LZ sites.
   3.4.7. Semi-permanent runways are usually surveyed by engineering units and do not require
   a survey by combat control personnel. However, semi-permanent and permanent
   installations, such as captured enemy airfields, must be assessed for possible aircraft hazards
   and correct dimensions prior to use. Combat control personnel may be tasked to perform this
   type of assessment using criteria outlined in paragraph 3.4.1.2.
NOTE:
Combat control personnel normally only conduct hard surface assessments for the theater
commander during contingencies.
   3.4.8. The combat controller or CRG airfield assessment team gathers data from the on-site
   survey, prepares an LZ survey package using the AF IMT 3822, Landing Zone Survey, and
   recommends approval or disapproval to the appropriate agency for use.

   3.4.9. During the survey process, if there is any potential for impact or damage to the
   environment due to the construction or modification of new or existing LZs, follow the
   procedures within AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process.
3.5. General Landing Zone Criteria. Combat controllers may be required to assist in selecting
LZs. General guidelines are available in AFJPAM 32-8013, Volume 2 (FM 5-430-00-2) and
ETLs. Specific tactical LZ criteria for the type aircraft involved are contained in applicable
MAJCOM supplements to this instruction. Additionally, the following general data applies to LZ
criteria:
NOTE: ST units will use AFCESA ETL 04-7, C-130 and C-17 Contingency and Training
Airfield Dimensional Criteria, and ETL 02-19, Airfield Pavement Evaluation, Standards and
Procedures. Electronic copies are available at:
http://www.afcesa.af.mil/library/etl.asp?Category=Engineering%20Technical%20Letters.
3.5. (AFSOC)General Landing Zone Criteria. Specific tactical LZ criteria for AFSOC
LTFW aircraft are listed in AFSOC Table 3.4 – 3.10 and depicted in AFSOC Figure 3.7 – 3.11.
   3.5.1. Size and Terrain. LZs should be of sufficient size to permit rapid takeoff, landing, and
   loading operations. Terrain may be of soil, dirt, sand, or another suitable surface.
   Consideration must be given to the slope and elevation of the runway, aircraft capability,
   taxiways, and loading restrictions including their ability to support aircraft weight. Criteria
   for the layout of newly constructed LZs are listed in detail in AFJPAM 32-8013, Volume II
   (FM 5-430-00-2), Table 11-3. Table 3.1 shows the general minimum sizes for various fixed-
   wing LZs. For criteria that are more specific, see MAJCOM publications.
   3.5.1. (AFSOC) Minimum runway width for AFSOC LTFW is 200% of wheel track.
   Specific LTFW MDS may require wider runways for routine/normal operations or based on
   crew qualification; refer to AFSOC Table 3.4 – 3.10 for additional information.
       3.5.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) See AFSOC Table 3.4 – 3.10 for the minimum LZ
       dimensions for AFSOC LTFW aircraft.
       3.5.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC LTFW aircraft have published lateral obstruction
       clearance criteria based A and B Zones. The size (width) of these zones is based on
       aircraft wing span and wheel track and determined using the formulas provided in
       AFSOC Figure 3.10. Zone A extends outward from the edge of the surveyed runway
       width. Zone B extends outward from the outside edge of Zone A. Figure 3.11 depicts
       the Zone A/B location.
          3.5.1.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) It is acceptable to conduct operations on an LZ whose
          survey lists a Zone B width that is less than the aircraft’s stated requirement, provided
          the Zone A width listed on the survey exceeds the aircraft’s minimum requirement by
          an equal or greater distance. For example, a C-145A may operate on an LZ with a 31'
          Zone A and a 7' Zone B. In this case the Zone B is 3" less than required but the Zone
          A is 5" greater than required.
          3.5.1.2.2. (Added-AFSOC) Insufficient Zone A and/or Zone B survey distances
          may be expanded by reducing runway width by an equal amount, down to the
          minimum runway width requirement. For example, a C-146A aircrew desires to land
          at an LZ with a runway that is 40' wide, with Zone As of 28' and Zone Bs of 7'. The
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                59


          LZ Zone A is 11" less than the C-146A requirement of 28' and 11". The crew may
          land at the LZ by treating only 38' of runway width as useable and adding 1' to both
          Zones. The portion of the runway outside this adjusted width will be treated as
          unusable.
      3.5.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) Carefully report detailed information on any/all vertical
      obstructions located within Zones A and B (e.g., number/type of obstructions, distance
      from edge of surveyed LZ or runway centerline, height above cross-sectional runway
      edge elevation, etc.). Maximum Obstacle Height for AFSOC LTFW aircraft (T-2):
          3.5.1.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) For semi-prepared surface taxiways and runways,
          obstacles will not be higher than four inches unless the aircraft flight manual (AFM),
          pilot operating handbook (POH), or aircraft addendum to this instruction is more
          restrictive (T-2).
          3.5.1.3.2. (Added-AFSOC) Single-Engine Low-Wing Aircraft:             Zone A – 12",
          Zone B – 60".
          3.5.1.3.3. (Added-AFSOC) Single-Engine High-Wing Aircraft:            Zone A – 36",
          Zone B – 60".
          3.5.1.3.4. (Added-AFSOC) Multiengine Low-Wing Aircraft: Zone A – 4", Zone B
          – 60".
          3.5.1.3.5. (Added-AFSOC) Multiengine High-Wing Aircraft: Zone A – 36", Zone
          B – 60".

   3.5.2. Environmental Impact Analysis. The proponent of the survey request (i.e., the
   requesting office, unit, or activity) is responsible for completing the AF Form 813, Request
   for Environmental Analysis. AF Form 813 is used to document the need for environmental
   analysis of certain categorical exclusion determinations for proposed actions. This form helps
   narrow and focus the issues to potential environmental impacts.
60                                                     AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


  3.5.3. Soil Conditions. Before any short field training operations are scheduled from an
  unprepared strip, there must be a thorough investigation of soil conditions to determine
  whether the abrasive content could adversely affect aircraft operations. Whenever possible,
  the weight bearing capacity of the landing, taxiing, and parking areas must be determined.
  The weight bearing capacity is determined IAW AFJPAM 32-8013, Volume II (FM 5-430-
  00-2).
  3.5.3. (AFSOC) Landing Zone Survey Form will contain a controlling reading for each
  movement area depicted on the survey (i.e., Runway, Taxiways and Aprons). The runway
  information will be listed in the LZ surface data section with additional information in the
  remarks section (T-2).
  3.5.4. LZ Surface Tolerances and Clearances. Tolerance or roughness will depend upon
  sheer strength, hardness, and size of items that cause roughness. Roughness interrupts
  smooth rotation of aircraft tires and interferes with marginal aerodynamic lift of flight control
  surfaces at slow speed. Location and frequency of surface crests or wave tops are of
  paramount importance. The following items may be used as a guide in determining suitability
  of runway surface, shoulders, and clear areas. Exceeding these limits may result in structural
  failures of the aircraft. Roughness must be minimized for sustained operations.
  3.5.5. Traffic Area (Runway, Overruns, Taxiways, Parking Apron):
     3.5.5.1. Rocks. Rocks in traffic areas must be removed, embedded, or interlocked with
     each other so aircraft tires will traverse the area without causing displacements.
     3.5.5.2. Soil Balls (dried cohesive dirt clods). Soil balls or dry cohesive dirt clods (clay
     excluded) up to 6 inches in diameter that will burst upon tire impact are allowed.
     Hardened clay clods that have similar characteristics as rocks and exceed 4 inches in
     diameter must be pulverized or removed from the traffic areas.
     3.5.5.3. Tree Stumps. Remove all stumps; fill holes, and compact soil to the weight
     bearing capacity of the surrounding surface.
     3.5.5.4. Ditches. Eliminate ditches from traffic areas. When filled, the weight bearing
     capacity must be that of the surrounding area.
     3.5.5.5. Plowed Fields. Contours of dirt patterns established to reduce erosion, water
     drain-off, and for planting preparation which have been accomplished by agricultural
     plowing usually contain a soft core and normally will not require removal. However,
     such dirt patterns should be examined carefully to determine the need for removal.
     3.5.5.6. Depressions and Soil Mounds. Depressions and soil mounds do not have sharp
     corners and are recognized as oval or circular gradual sinks or rises. Level or fill
     depressions or mounds that exceed 15 inches across the top and 6 inches in depth or
     height until they meet grade tolerance criteria.
     3.5.5.7. Potholes. Potholes are circular or oval in shape and are distinguished from
     depressions by their smaller size and sharp corners. Potholes must be filled if they exceed
     15 inches across their widest point and 6 inches in depth.
  3.5.6. Shoulder. A graded and compacted area on either side of the runway to minimize the
  risk to aircraft of running off or landing off the runway. Shoulders should have tree stumps
  cut flush with the ground; rocks and objects, which could be ingested by engines or cause
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                61


  damage to the bottom of the aircraft should be removed. Shoulders are normally 10 feet wide
  with a maximum positive or negative grade of 3%.
  3.5.6. (AFSOC) Shoulders are not required for AFSOC LTFW aircraft.               See AFSOC
  Table 3.4 - 3.10 for LTFW aircraft LZ criteria.
  3.5.7. Graded Area (previously clear area). An area located adjacent to and outside of the
  runway shoulders. Grades may slope up or down to provide drainage, but may not penetrate
  the primary surface. The minimum grade is 2% and the maximum is 5%. Graded areas
  should not have any obstacles over 4 inches high except vegetation, runway edge markers,
  runway distance remaining markers, Mobile Aircraft Arresting Systems (MAAS), and/or
  other visual or electronic navigational aids which must be sited in this area due to their
  function. Width of graded area varies from 35 feet (10.7m) to 375 feet (114.3m) depending
  upon type aircraft the airfield is intended to support. Appropriate dimensions are contained in
  MAJCOM supplements to this instruction.
  3.5.7. (AFSOC) Graded areas are not required for AFSOC LTFW aircraft. See AFSOC
  Table 3.4 - 3.10 for LTFW aircraft LZ criteria.
  3.5.8. Clear Zone. A cleared area located at each end of the runway. Width is normally equal
  to runway, shoulders, and clear areas and length is normally 500 feet or 1,000 feet (152.4m
  or 304.8m).
  3.5.8. (AFSOC) See AFSOC Table 3.8 for LTFW aircraft clear zone requirements.
  3.5.9. Transitional Area (previously lateral safety zone). The normal width requirements are
  30 feet U-28A, 60 feet (C-130), or 70 feet (C-17), extending outward from the graded area
  with a maximum positive slope of 10% and a maximum negative slope of 20%. Transitional
  areas should meet the criteria for the most restrictive type of aircraft using the LZ.
  3.5.9. (AFSOC) Transitional Areas are not required for AFSOC LTFW aircraft.                See
  AFSOC Table 3.4 - 3.10 for LTFW aircraft LZ criteria.
  3.5.10. Approach Zones. A trapezoidal area extending outward from each clear zone within
  which no object may penetrate the glideslope angle. Approach zones should meet the criteria
  for the type of aircraft using the LZ. The normal clearance surface is established on a 35:1
  ratio for U-28A and C-130 operations and 20:1 for C-17 operations.
  3.5.10. (AFSOC) The Approach Zone may be segmented into Controlling and Reportable
  Regions, if required (see AFSOC Figure 3.9). If segmented into Controlling and Reportable
  regions, report the most conservative glide slope ratio based obstructions in the Controlling
  Region. The minimum width of the Controlling Region is the distance between the outer
  edge of the surveyed B Zones. The actual glide slope ratio will be reported (e.g., if the
  controlling obstacle is a 70’ tall tower 2,900’ from the end of the clear zone, the GSR will be
  reported as 41:1). Report all vertical obstructions in the Approach Zone that penetrate a 35:1
  GSR measured from the end of the clear zone. (T-2)
     3.5.10.1. (Added-AFSOC) If an LZ has vertical obstructions in the controlling region
     of the Approach Zone and is intended for use by LTFW aircraft with different glide slope
     requirements (e.g., 8:1 for C-145A and 35:1 for C-146A), annotate the threshold
     coordinates for the steepest glide slope (e.g., 8:1) as the approach end of runway in Block
     9 of the AF Form 3822 , Landing Zone Survey. Include the coordinates for a displaced
 62                                                     AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


      threshold location (e.g., 35:1) along with displacement distance (in feet) in the remarks
      section of the survey form. Ensure sufficient vertical obstruction information is provided
      (i.e., obstruction height, distance from end of clear zone, etc.) to allow crew members of
      other aircraft types to calculate displaced threshold locations based on the requirements
      of their platform. (T-2)
   3.5.11. Overrun. A graded and compacted portion of the clear zone, located as an extension
   to the end of the runway. An overrun is normally not considered part of the usable runway
   when establishing airfield markings. Do not include overrun distances to calculate the
   available LZ length required for operations. Overruns are used to minimize risk to aircraft
   due to overrun on takeoff or undershooting a landing. The width is normally equal to that of
   the runway and the type of aircraft involved determines length. See MAJCOM supplements
   to this instruction.
   3.5.11. (AFSOC) See AFSOC Table 3.7 for LTFW aircraft overrun requirements.
3.6. Landing Zone Markings.
   3.6.1. LZ Marking Equipment. LZs are normally marked with VS-17 marker panels secured
   to upright supports for day operations and omni-directional visible lighting systems with a
   minimum output rating of 15 candela, and strobe lights if required, for night operations. The
   C-17 uses the visual landing zone marker panel (VLZMP). Virtually any type overt lighting
   or marking system is acceptable, if all participating units are briefed, and concur with its use.
   ST units may also use specialized clandestine lighting systems.
   3.6.2. LZ Markings and Identification. Specific details must be determined concerning the
   type and location of LZ markings as well as airfield identification procedures. Consider
   existing international agreements. LZ markings and identification procedures must be briefed
   to all associated ground and aircrew members.
   3.6.2. (AFSOC) Special consideration must be given before using AFSOC, 193 SOW, and
   919 SOW “C130 only” or LTFW aircraft marking patterns to ensure operations will not
   include non-AFSOC aircraft. (T-2)
   3.6.3. Airfield Markings. Utilize conventional airfield markings consistent with flying
   safety. When landings can be anticipated at both ends of the LZ, ensure touchdown areas are
   marked at both ends.
   3.6.4. Airfield Marking Patterns (AMP). In general, there are four standard types of airfield
   marking patterns, designated AMP-1 through AMP-4. These correspond to the type airland
   mission being supported and are used to simplify mission tasking. A 300 foot underrun and
   overrun are required for all LZ operations. The four standard LZ marking types include:
      3.6.4.1. AMP-1. Normally used to support day or night VMC tactical airlift missions.
      See Figure 3.1 for day markings and Figure 3.2 for night/instrument markings. These
      markings also implement STANAG 3601 and ASIC AIR STD 44/37C requirements.
      When using the AMP-1 pattern, aircrew mission planners are authorized to reduce or
      eliminate panel markings for well-defined runways during day VMC operations. As a
      minimum, the touchdown zone must be marked.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                63


          3.6.4.1.1. AMP-1 (Instrument Approach). Instrument approaches for contingency
          landing zones require special configuration. This configuration is used to support day
          or night tactical airlift missions during times of reduced visibility. Aircrew mission
          planners are not authorized to reduce or eliminate panels, lights, or electronic
          navigational aids during limited visibility operations.
             3.6.4.1.1.1. Minimum requirements include the following: Special Tactics
             personnel, ground-to-air radio communications, AN/TRN-45 Mobile Microwave
             Landing System (MMLS) and the Contingency Airfield Night Lighting System
             (CANLS). CANLS consists of two sequenced flashing lights, either side of the
             approach end of the runway, and five sequenced flashing lights on extended
             runway centerline at 300 feet intervals, Standard AMP 1 (Night/Instrument)
             Landing Zone markings, and an IFR modified TRN-41 portable TACAN. See
             Figure 3.2 for placement and configuration of these components.

NOTE: Minimum requirements allow single direction approaches. An additional MMLS and
approach lights are required if bi-directional approaches are desired or required.
             3.6.4.1.1.2. Location of the MMLS is based on a Special Tactics Team LZ
             Survey (runway length, obstacles, and airfield layout are all considerations) but is
             ultimately based on final Terminal Instrument Procedures approach
             plates/approval. However, for planning purposes, for a runway 5,000 feet or less
             in length, position the co-located MMLS 300 feet from the threshold and 200 feet
             right of centerline. For a runway greater than 5,000 feet in length, position the
             MMLS 700 feet from the threshold and 200 feet right of centerline.
             3.6.4.1.1.3. A FAA flight check or military aircraft flyability check will be
             accomplished prior to using the landing zone/airfield for sustained operations.
      3.6.4.2. AMP-2. AMP-2 can also be used to support day or night tactical airlift
      requirements. AMP-2 requires fewer panels or lights than AMP-1. Overt or covert
      lighting may be used. See Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4.
      3.6.4.3. AMP-3. AMP-3 further reduces the number of panels/lights used to support day
      or night tactical airlift requirements. Overt or covert lighting may be used. The “Box and
      One” is for runway identification only, and the box length will be 500 feet. See Figure
      3.5 and Figure 3.6.
          3.6.4.3. (AFSOC) The box length may be 500' or 1000' for AFSOC C-130 aircraft
          depending on the tactical situation. The box length may be 200' for LTFW aircraft. If
          the box length is not 500', it is mandatory the LZ controlling authority ensures all
          participating aircraft are notified of the nonstandard box length. (T-2). See Figures
          3.5 and Figure 3.6.
      3.6.4.4. AMP-4. No markings are required.
   3.6.5. Marking Considerations:
      3.6.5.1. The LZ markings must be clearly visible to the pilot as early on the approach as
      possible.
 64                                                     AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


       3.6.5.2. If security requires, night LZ markings should be visible only from the direction
       of the aircraft’s approach. If flashlights are used, they may be equipped with simple
       hoods or shields and aimed toward the approaching aircraft. Fires or improvised flares
       may be screened on three sides or placed in pits with sides sloping toward the direction of
       approach.
       3.6.5.3. During daylight landings, marker panels should be erected upright, facing
       toward the aircraft approach, to increase the pilot’s ability to see them. Marker panels and
       supports must be reasonably frangible to avoid excessive damage if struck by an aircraft.
       3.6.5.4. Mark loading and taxi areas as determined during mission planning. For night
       operations, place suitable blue lights 500 feet apart on the straight portions, and when
       required, reflectors should be placed halfway between the blue lights. Light spacing may
       be reduced to 75 feet on curves and at corners or intersections.

3.7. Emergency Signals. Standard air traffic control light signals are normally used if radio
communications are not established. A go around may also be signaled by using either red flares,
a red light beam aimed directly at the pilot, or a radio call to the pilot. See Table 3.2.

NOTE: Emergency signals must be coordinated and thoroughly briefed. NVG equipped crews
may be unable to discern colored lights, and any light signal pointed at the aircraft may blind the
aircrew.

3.8. Communications. The OG/CC or ACC will determine communications requirements.
Standard Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radio procedures will be used unless otherwise
briefed. The Landing Zone Controller (LZC) and Landing Zone Safety Officer (LZSO) are the
only individuals authorized to communicate control instructions to aircraft operating near an LZ.
 68                                                     AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


3.9. Terminal NAVAIDS. ST units have the capability to tactically employ and operate a
variety of NAVAIDS in support of LZ operations. The units deploy NAVAIDS, such as the
TACAN, ZM, mobile microwave landing system (MMLS), or radar beacons as directed by the
ACC. Standard NAVAID placement procedures are listed below; however, the tactical
environment will frequently require modifications of these standard placements.
   3.9.1. TACAN. When used for instrument procedures, recommended placement is 150 feet
   right of runway centerline abeam the first set of approach lights in an area free of excessive
   aircraft, vehicle, and troop movements.
   3.9.2. Radar Beacons. Since radar beacons transmit signals via “line-of-sight,” terrain on the
   LZ and along the inbound course must be taken into consideration to allow the earliest
   possible acquisition. Ensure aircrews are briefed on beacon placement. For AMP-1 through
   AMP-3 Landings, place one radar beacon (code 2) 150 feet left of runway centerline abeam
   the first set of steady lights (panels) in the touch down zone. Place a second beacon (code 1)
   150 feet left of the departure end flashing strobe.
3.10. Landing Zone Personnel.
   3.10.1. Minimum Personnel. A Landing Zone Safety Officer (LZSO) is required and,
   depending on the operations, a Landing Zone Controller (LZC) may also be required.
   3.10.1. (AFSOC) Special Operations Group (SOG)/CCs (or COMAFSOF) may waive the
   requirement for an LZSO, as the minimum LZ personnel required. For training operations,
   aircrews will conduct a minimum of one clearing pass prior to the initial touch down at an
   unattended LZ. (T-2)
   3.10.2. The LZC's primary function is to provide air traffic control services.
   3.10.2. (AFSOC) Unit commanders may certify qualified government civilians or contract
   civilians who were previous combat controllers as a LZC/LZSO.
      3.10.2.1. The LZC will be a qualified combat controller certified by the unit commander
      as capable of performing unilateral or joint air traffic control duties. ST units are
      authorized to combine LZC/LZSO functions during VFR operations. When combined,
      LZSO skill level requirements must be met.
   3.10.3. The LZSO will normally be a qualified E-5 or above (seven or nine skill level)
   combat control NCO, special tactics officer, AMLO, or airlift aircrew officer (U-28A, C-130
   or C-17 aircrew officer for LZ operations) certified by the unit commander as capable of
   performing as a LZSO.
   3.10.3. (AFSOC) Unit commanders may certify government civilians or contract civilians
   with the listed experience and proper training as a LZCO. All AFSOC rated officers with the
   proper training may be LZCO certified by the unit commander.
      3.10.3.1. During visual flight rules (VFR) operations not requiring Air Traffic Control
      (ATC) services (Class G airspace), qualified Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Air
      National Guard (ANG), and AF active duty personnel designated by their commander
      may establish LZ markings. If the LZ is semi-prepared, they are restricted to operations
      on their local training LZ. These personnel assume the LZSO responsibilities listed in
      paragraph 3.10.4.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                               69


NOTE:
USAFWS Weapons Officer airlift cadre may perform LZSO duties at all approved CONUS LZs
not requiring an LZCO. These personnel assume LZSO duties and responsibilities listed in
3.10.4 provided they have received the HQ AFSOC formal training by a 7-level combat
controller or aircrew certified personnel formally trained by a 7-level combat controller.
Under no circumstances are personnel who fall under this category permitted to provide aircraft
with air traffic control services.
          3.10.3.1.1. Aircrew member certification will consist of training coordinated between
          the flying squadrons and ST. This training will be conducted using HQ AFSOC
          formal lesson plans. The flying squadron commander will review/authorize unilateral
          single-ship missions to landing zones without a LZC or an operating control tower
          (Class G airspace).
          3.10.3.1.2. Non-USAF / Non-aircrew personnel. If contingency operations require
          USAF use of landing zones not defined within the scope of this AFI, or under the
          operational control of non-USAF / non-aircrew personnel, a combat controller or
          AMLO may train allied forces personnel (with ACC or DIRMOBFOR approval) to
          perform LZSO duties IAW paragraph 3.10.4 of this instruction using approved HQ
          AFSOC formal lesson plans. The instructor will provide a letter certifying personnel
          to perform LZSO duties limited to the landing strip trained on and for a specified
          duration.
       3.10.3.2. Units listed in paragraph 2.17.3.2 are authorized to use qualified personnel to
       establish LZs supporting single-ship VMC operations that do not require air traffic
       control services (Class G airspace).
NOTE:
Under no circumstances are personnel who fall under this category permitted to provide aircraft
with air traffic control services.
          3.10.3.2.1. Civilian contract personnel who were previously qualified as a combat
          controller, or were a C-130 or C-17 aircrew officer, must complete the HQ AFSOC
          formal lesson plan and receive instruction IAW paragraph 3.10.3.1.1 before they are
          authorized to control landing zone operations. These personnel assume the LZSO
          responsibilities listed in paragraph 3.10.4. Previously qualified combat control
          personnel may perform LZC functions provided their statement of work requires
          those duties, they pass a flying class II physical and meet LZC currency requirements
          outlined in AFSOCI 36-2204.
   3.10.4. The LZSO represents the OG/CC or ACC as provided in mission directives and is
   responsible for the following:
       3.10.4.1. Ensuring required aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) coverage is at the LZ
       prior to beginning airland operations, and ensures continuous contact with ARFF is
       maintained.
       3.10.4.2. Maintaining close liaison with the using unit commander, or designated
       representative, during joint operations.
 70                                                     AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


       3.10.4.3. Observing and evaluating all factors that may adversely affect the safety and
       efficiency of the operation.
       3.10.4.4. Inspecting the LZ prior to use IAW paragraph 3.5, and validating the LZ meets
       criteria listed on the current LZ survey.
       3.10.4.5. Monitoring the conditions of the landing, taxi, and parking areas, and ensuring
       the runway is free of obstacles before advising aircraft they are cleared to land/takeoff at
       their own discretion.
       3.10.4.6. Ensuring LZ markings and NAVAID placement are correct and operating.
       3.10.4.7. Ground handling and marshaling of aircraft.
       3.10.4.8. Evaluating and reporting surface wind and meteorological phenomenon.
       3.10.4.9. Ensuring the dissemination of available altimeter settings.
       3.10.4.10. Formulating minimum safe altitudes and monitoring the deconfliction of
       artillery and close air support operations.
       3.10.4.11. Advising the LZC if conditions are unsafe for landing operations and ensures
       cancellation of operations is relayed to appropriate agencies.
       3.10.4.12. Supervising all Air Force personnel on the LZ.
       3.10.4.13. Maintaining contact with the LZC during the operation.
3.11. Rolling Friction Factor. When conducting operations on semi-prepared surfaces with C-
17 aircraft, the LZC/LZSO will determine the runway friction factor IAW ETL-97-9. C-17
mission planners optimally require this factor a minimum of 24hrs prior to airland operations.
   3.11.1. This value will be reported to each departing C-17 prior to taxi, and again prior to
   departure. This value will also be reported to arriving C-17 aircraft.
   3.11.2. After each C-17 departure, or whenever the LZ team notices a discernable
   deterioration of the LZ surface, they will re-determine the rolling friction factor. During
   sustained operations, consideration to the ability to gather data must be realized. If the new
   factor is not feasible, then C-17 aircraft will be given the last value noting the time it was
   taken and how many sorties have taken place since that reading.
3.12. LZ Control Point Location. The LZC locates the control point after considering
pertinent factors such as security, runway in use, and view of the airfield and surrounding
airspace. Separation of aircraft and the ability to detect hazards on or near the operating area
supersede other concerns.
3.13. Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Requirements. Specific requirements for ARFF are
contained in MAJCOM (i.e., AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations) publications. When
required, the user will preposition suitable equipment at the LZ prior to conducting operations.
3.14. Landing Zone Review Process. The following paragraphs outline the LZ survey process
from performing the initial groundwork to the final incorporation of the LZ into the ZAR
database. Use of the ZAR will expedite mission planning, enhance safety, and avoid duplication
of surveys. Information in the ZAR does not replace the need for a completed survey prior to
conducting landing zone operations. All completed surveys should be forwarded by the
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                  71


appropriate agencies to HQ AMC/A3DT for inclusion in the worldwide database. LZ surveys
become obsolete 5 years after date of MAJCOM approval (block 4C of AF Form 3822) and must
be resurveyed prior to use. Procedures for requesting an initial or re-survey of an LZ are
contained in paragraph 1.4.
NOTE:
Other MAJCOMs and contingency AOCs may maintain their own ZAR database (if desired).
However, this does not alleviate them of the responsibility to provide these surveys to HQ
AMC/A3DT for inclusion in the worldwide ZAR database, unless classification requirements
dictate otherwise.
   3.14.1. Combat control personnel or qualified civilians complete the AF IMT 3822,
   Landing Zone Survey (Attachment 5). Qualified civilians may be a GS employee,
   contractor, and/or temporary contractor hired by DoD to perform survey specific duties. All
   qualified civilians will be trained IAW the current AFSOC survey training guidance and
   meet AFSC 1C2X1, combat control, CFETP training requirements. Training will be
   validated in a memorandum signed by the 720 STG/CC and tracked at the 720 OSS.
   3.14.2. Following completion of the ground survey by combat control personnel or qualified
   civilians, the AF IMT 3822 is forwarded to the appropriate chief, wing/group tactics, or as
   designated by the OG/CC, for a safety-of-flight review. The MAJCOM/A3 or ACC or their
   designated representative is final approval authority.
   3.14.2. (AFSOC) Reviewing authority in order of preference is the group tactics officer;
   group stan/eval officer, squadron operations officer or their representative. Final approval
   authority is delegated to the OG/CC or COMAFSOF. (T-2)
      3.14.2.1. Safety-of-Flight Review. A safety-of-flight review is completed by the nearest
      Air Force wing/group tactics office on all LZ surveys. The purpose of a safety-of-flight
      review is to ensure an aircraft can safely ingress, egress and operate in the vicinity of the
      LZ. A safety-of-flight review includes an in-depth chart study of the terrain features,
      obstructions to flight, and airspace restrictions along the route of flight to and from an
      LZ. For a complete list of regional group/wing tactics offices see:
      https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AM-40.                          A
      1:50,000-scale chart and satellite imagery (if available) should be used when available for
      the objective area and at least a 1:250,000-scale chart for the ingress, egress and traffic
      pattern. If approved by the MAJCOM, Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS) may be
      used instead of paper charts. The safety-of flight review lists all obstructions such as
      terrain, towers, or power lines that may affect the aircraft’s ability to achieve ingress,
      egress, traffic pattern altitudes and airspeeds. The safety-of-flight review will also review
      any prohibited areas, restricted operating zones (ROZs), noise sensitive areas, special use
      airspace, route of flight to avoid such areas, preferred routing, NOTAM requirements,
      population areas etc. Evaluate terrain/obstructions within a radius of 5nm (minimum) and
      10nm (desired) from the LZ centerpoint. High altitude penetrations to the LZ may require
      evaluation of terrain/obstructions out to a 20nm radius. Evaluate likely avenues of
      ingress/egress along runway centerline and others as mission planning requirements
      dictate arrival/departure paths. Evaluation of terrain/obstructions should include service
      ceiling and climb performance for the particular aircraft involved, the ability of the
      aircraft to take-off/fly over the LZ at low speeds and escape from the LZ using 3-engine
 72                                                    AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


       climb out rates. If these criteria cannot be met, the ingress/egress routing must be
       modified, altitude raised, take-off/landing directions restricted to one-way operations, or
       the safety-of-flight review denied.
   3.14.3. The AF IMT 3822 is not valid for use until it has been reviewed and recommended
   for use by the appropriate MAJCOM/A3 or the ACC. The AF IMT 3822 is then forwarded
   for inclusion in the landing zone database.
   3.14.3. (AFSOC) HQ AFSOC/A3 designates OG/CC (Wing/CC for National Guard Bureau
   (NGB)) or COMAFSOF as final approval authority for landing zone surveys. If OG/CC or
   COMAFSOF is not an O-6, approval authority rests with the first O-6 in the operational
   chain of command.
   3.14.4. The AF IMT 3822 documents the conditions that existed at the time the survey was
   accomplished and may not account for changes to the LZ seasonal topography. The condition
   of the LZ should be confirmed prior to commencing operations.

Section 3B—Helicopter Landing Zone Operations

3.15. General. Helicopters require their own landing zone procedures to safely operate in areas
unsuitable for fixed-wing aircraft. HLZ surveys are required for all training and exercises and
highly recommended as part of the normal mission planning for contingencies. HLZ surveys are
not required if another survey is available (ie. fixed wing LZ survey or FARP survey). The
paragraphs below define the procedures.
3.15. (AFSOC)General. AFSOC Tiltrotor units do not require a HLZ surveys for
MAJCOM/Joint Chief of Staff (JCS)-directed exercises or contingency operations. The
requirement to complete an AF Form 4303, Helicopter Landing Zone Survey, for training
remains in effect. (T-2)
3.16. Helicopter Landing Zone Selection. Helicopter landing zones (HLZ) are dependent on
the aircraft type and size, and whether the HLZ will be used for takeoffs/landings or alternate
insertion/extraction (AIE). Selecting the HLZ location is the joint responsibility of the ACC and
the supported force commander. JFSOCC forces determine their suitable locations from
JSOACC recommendations.
   3.16.1. Weight Bearing Capacity. HLZs are dependent on the aircraft type or size. Weight
   bearing capacity is not required for helicopter operations, but care must be exercised to
   ensure the HLZ is cleared to prevent possible engine damage or personnel injury from flying
   debris due to hover operations.
3.17. Helicopter Landing Zone Markings. MAJCOMs may supplement this instruction with
their unique requirements. There are no USAF requirements to mark HLZs for day or NVG use.
HLZs flown to unaided at night must be clearly marked with a minimum of two overt lights that
either outline or target obstruction free areas compatible with the aircraft being used.
Additionally, overt spot or landing lights must be available and used by the aircraft during the
approach.
3.18. Helicopter Landing Zone Survey Requirements. The HLZ survey program is a group
tactics function or an office with an equivalent level of expertise. Group tactics must ensure
surveys are conducted IAW the procedures below.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                     73


3.18. (AFSOC)Helicopter Landing Zone Survey Requirements. The OG/CC may delegate
responsibility for the HLZ program to the squadron level (SOG Tactics will remain as the
repository of HLZ surveys, when accomplished, IAW Paragraph 3.19.4). (T-2)
   3.18.1. Completing the HLZ survey process involves a physical inspection of the HLZ,
   documenting the information on the AF Form 4303, Helicopter Landing Zone Survey, a
   safety-of-flight review, and final approval. MAJCOMs will determine their own requirement
   for HLZ surveys for AIE training. Surveys may be accomplished by the using units whose
   equipment or personnel are being landed or for an AIE. For exercises and joint training
   operations, users must ensure the survey is completed and meets the appropriate criteria for
   operational and safety standards. The user must conduct a physical inspection of the HLZ
   prior to use to identify and evaluate potential hazards to personnel/equipment, man-made or
   natural structures, and ground personnel. If the survey was conducted using any other method
   than GPS-derived coordinates, provide the reviewer with the raw coordinate data and the
   method of conversion.
   3.18.1. (AFSOC) The physical inspection/survey may be conducted via a high/low
   reconnaissance (high/low recon) by any current and qualified instructor pilot. A physical
   inspection/survey may also be accomplished during daytime by a current and qualified
   aircraft commander. LZ’s designated for AIE training should follow the same criteria as for
   regular HLZ’s, but should be annotated as “AIE Only” in the HLZ’s name and remarks
   section. (T-2)
      3.18.1.1. Host Nation (HN) HLZ Surveys. When conducting operations on or over a HN
      surveyed HLZ, a review of the HN survey will be accomplished before operations to the
      HLZ begin. Users remain responsible for ground operational and safety criteria.
      3.18.1.2. A 1:50,000 scale chart or less should be used when available for the objective
      area for the ingress and egress (Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS) may be used
      instead of paper charts if approved by the MAJCOM). The review lists all obstructions
      such as terrain, towers, or power lines that may affect the helicopter’s route of flight.
      Also listed on the review are any prohibited areas, noise sensitive areas, special use
      airspace, route of flight to avoid such areas, preferred routing, NOTAM requirements,
      etc. Evaluation of terrain/obstructions should consider the particular helicopter involved,
      and the ability to fly over and/or land on the HLZ unless OGE hover power plus 5-
      percent is available. If these criteria cannot be met, the ingress must be modified, or the
      review denied.
      3.18.1.2. (AFSOC) AFSOC crews may use PFPS for conducting HLZ survey reviews.
   3.18.2. When conducting operations on a HLZ that was previously surveyed by another unit,
   the commander of the using unit is responsible for ensuring the HLZ meets the criteria for
   that operation. In all cases, the using unit must accept responsibility for all personnel injuries,
   parachute or load damage, and property damage.
   3.18.3. Tactical HLZ Surveys. During exercises and contingencies, when time or situations
   do not permit completion of a full HLZ survey, a tactical HLZ survey may be required to
   meet the appropriate commander’s objective(s).
 74                                                   AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


       3.18.3.1. Though preferable, the use of an AF Form 4303 is not required for a tactical
       survey. Requests and surveys may be passed electronically. As much information as
       practical should be obtained and forwarded for review.
       3.18.3.2. Requests for tactical surveys will be forwarded to the designated
       exercise/contingency ACC for final review.
       3.18.3.3. When using a tactical HLZ, the rotary-wing unit assumes responsibility for
       helicopter safety-of-flight.
3.19. Helicopter Landing Zone Review Process. The following paragraphs outline the HLZ
review process from performing the initial groundwork to the final coordination. All completed
surveys will be forwarded to the group tactics office, or an office with an equivalent level of
expertise. Surveys will be reaccomplished when the user and/or provider determine changes in
the ground or air aspects of the HLZ data require a new survey.
   3.19.1. The HLZ surveys will be conducted during daylight by a qualified combat controller;
   survey qualified rotary wing aircrew member, Chief Group Weapons and Tactics, or a
   qualified civilian. Qualified civilians will meet the training and documentation requirements
   listed in para 3.14.1. AFSPC will establish requirements in their supplement for surveying
   Missile Alert Facilities (MAF) and Launch Facilities. The surveyor (AF Form 4303, item
   4A) performs the actual ground portion of the HLZ survey (i.e., measurements, coordinates,
   calculating size, obtaining maps and creating diagrams) and annotates results on the AF Form
   4303. The surveyor may be a member of the unit that intends to use the HLZ, or a member of
   another unit may perform the ground portion of a survey if requested and time permits. To
   facilitate future use of surveyed HLZs, initial surveys will encompass the largest area
   available and will not be limited by specific mission requirements. The surveyor will forward
   the completed survey to the group tactics office, or the OG/CC designated office, for review.
   Include recommended use, any deviations from HLZ standards contained in service or
   MAJCOM directives, and other pertinent remarks.
   3.19.1. (AFSOC) The physical inspection/survey may be conducted via high/low recon by
   any current and qualified instructor pilot. A physical inspection/survey may also be
   accomplished during daytime by a current and qualified aircraft commander.
   3.19.2. The reviewer, in order of preference, is the Chief, Group Tactics, Squadron
   Commander, or Squadron Operations Officer (AFSPC/A3 may designate the helicpter
   squadron commander and operations officer as reviewing officials). The reviewer (AF Form
   4303, item 4B) ensures the HLZ can be safely used from a flight perspective. Throughout the
   review process, HLZ survey packages will include all applicable maps, photos, charts and
   diagrams necessary to determine the safety and utility of the HLZ.
   3.19.2. (AFSOC) For AFSOC units the reviewer is waived to no lower than the assistant
   operations officer. (T-2)
   3.19.3. Approval Authority (AF Form 4303, item 4C). Prior to use, surveys will be approved
   for air operations by the OG/CC or appropriate ACC. This approval assures the review has
   been accomplished and the HLZ is considered safe for air operations.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                              75


   3.19.3. (AFSOC) If a JSOAC or JSOTF is established, the JSOAC/CC or JSOTF/CC may
   sign item 4C. The approval authority is waived to the squadron commander, or the first O-5
   in the chain of command. (T-2)
   3.19.4. Once item 4C of AF Form 4303 is completed, the survey is ready for use. Respective
   group tactics offices are the local area repositories for HLZ surveys. AFSPC/A3 will
   designate an office to serve as a repository for LZ surveys.
   3.19.5. HLZ surveys document the conditions that existed at the time the survey was
   accomplished, and may not account for changes to seasonal topography. Recommended uses
   may be based on minimum requirements and should not be misconstrued to be all-inclusive
   (i.e., a HLZ recommended for two MH-53s may not be suitable for a CV-22). It is the
   responsibility of the flying and ground units involved to ensure that any HLZ being
   considered for use meets the requirements for their specific operation.
3.20. Helicopter Landing Zone Survey Updates. HLZ surveys will be updated every six
months. HLZs that are not updated in the six months time period will be closed until resurveyed
using the above criteria (does not require a new AF Form 4303). AFSPC will establish
requirements in their supplement for updating MAF and Launch Facilities. The absolute
minimum to update a HLZ survey requires a qualified combat controller, qualified rotary wing
aircrew member, or Chief Group Weapons and Tactics to resurvey the HLZ during daylight. This
member must evaluate items 6 through 10 of AF Form 4303. Annotate date of update and
surveyor’s initials in remarks section. A HLZ survey that has not been updated for 12 months is

                 LC-130 SKIWAY AND SKI LANDING AREA CRITERIA

4.1. General. These procedures apply to all agencies involved in or supporting LC-130
operations and clarify Skiway and Ski Landing Area requirements.
4.2. Ski Landing Area Control Officer (SLACO). 109th Airlift Wing (ANG) develops and
maintains procedures to train and certify SLACOs.
   4.2.1. SLACOs will be designated before the deployment and will be either an experienced
   LC-130 pilot or combat controller experienced in LC-130 ski operations. The SLACO will be
   at the site and examine the results of the Ski Landing Area testing, preparation and marking.
   If the area meets requirements, and with the concurrence of the Camp Manager, the SLACO
   will advise the 109 AW Deployed Commander LC-130 ski landings/takeoffs may
   commence. A certified SLACO will remain at the Ski Landing Area during all initial LC-130
   Ski operations until complete or until relieved by the Deployed Commander.
4.3. Selection of Skiway or Ski Landing Area. Agencies planning scientific research or
military exercises must choose between construction of a Skiway or Ski Landing Area. Proposed
landing locations must be submitted IAW paragraph 4.3.1 so they can be evaluated in terms of
distance from hard surface staging bases, cargo requirements, meteorological conditions, number
of landings and takeoffs, duration of the operation and the amount of cargo to be
offloaded/onloaded. Agencies requiring landings and takeoffs on sea ice must also provide
information on ice depth and surface characteristics. Minimum thickness is discussed in Table
4.1.
   4.3.1. Submit proposed landing locations to 109 AW/139 AS Tactics (DOW), 1 Air National
   Guard Road, Scotia, NY 12302-9752. Phone: comm 518-344-2640/2650, or DSN 344-
   2640/2650.
4.4. Sea Ice Depth Testing and Evaluation Criteria. Extensive research and testing of ice
characteristics has been done by several agencies and a large body of scientific research and
testing data is available to agencies interested in ice field or sea ice operations. The following
paragraphs provide simple LC-130 ski operations limitations and procedures.
   4.4.1. The load bearing capacity of ice sheets varies with thickness, surface temperature, and
   weight of the aircraft and parking time. Minimum ice thickness required for LC-130
   operations is based on data derived from US Naval Civil Engineering Lab, Technical Report
   R860, Study of Related Properties of Floating Sea-Ice Sheets and Summary of Elastic and
   Visco-Elastic Analyses, and LC-130 aircraft field experience. The limits in Table 4.1 are
   established as minimum values for LC-130 aircraft. They may be applied up to the maximum
   ski landing/takeoff gross weight of 147,000 pounds. Operations with ambient temperature
   above freezing must be evaluated and approved by the commander.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                 77


Table 4.1. Ice Weight Bearing Capacity.
     SURFACE TEMPERATURE                         MINIMUM ICE THICKNESS
          -10 deg C or less                             55 inches
           -10 to -5 deg C                              60 inches
            -5 to 0 deg C                               85 inches

   4.4.2. Testing of sea ice depth at landing/takeoff areas should be done by drilling through the
   ice at 500-foot intervals on alternated sides for the entire length of the landing area.
   Minimum depth values may not include surface snow or slush. Additional drill tests should
   be performed weekly during continuous operations or prior to resuming landings/takeoffs
   after a period of non-use of more than one week. The area should be checked regularly for
   signs of cracking or surface deterioration.
   4.4.3. Surface evaluation of potential landing/takeoff areas is necessary to assure the area is
   suitable for LC-130 ski operations. The better the natural conditions the less preparation
   work will be necessary. The best condition is a relatively smooth ice surface with 2 or more
   years of snow accumulation to a depth of 12 inches (minimum acceptable depth is 6 inches).
   Conditions to be avoided are:
      4.4.3.1. Undulating or irregular ice sub-surface impacting the skis during landing or
      takeoff. The undulating sub-surface may be covered with snow that would be deformed
      by the skis during ski runs.
      4.4.3.2. Bare ice with little or no snow cover. Snow cover is required to cushion and
      distribute loads over the skis. Even small irregularities or cracks in bare ice can create
      stress points along the ski that can cause damage.
      4.4.3.3. Large irregularities in the snow surface (sastrugis, ridges, and humps) require
      extensive surface preparation before ski operations.
4.5. Skiway Marking.
   4.5.1. Skiways will be marked in accordance with Figure 4.1. These markings are intended
   to allow flight operations in instrument meteorological conditions. The length and width of
   the marked area may vary with field elevation, snow conditions, operating gross weight, and
   duration of use. Minimum length and width is 5,000 ft x 150 ft at sea level. Length and width
   up to 15,000 ft x 300 ft may be required at higher elevations. IAW paragraph 4.3.1, 109 AW
   will coordinate with the supported agency to determine length and width for development of
   a particular Skiway. In addition to Skiway markings, a cargo offload/onload area will be
   marked (Figure 4.2). It may be located adjacent to the Skiway or further removed according
   to camp requirements. Accumulated cargo or other structures must not be closer than 75 feet
   from any skiway edges. Skiway markers are made from nylon mesh and mounted on bamboo
   poles (Figure 4.3).
   4.5.2. Operations of a temporary nature requiring limited ski landings/takeoffs may not
   require an established Skiway. 109 AW, in coordination with the agency being supported,
   will determine whether a Ski Landing Area or Skiway will be established for a particular
   operation. Factors such as field elevation, density altitude and snow conditions will be
 78                                                    AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


   considered to determine minimum length and width of the Ski Landing Area. A Ski Landing
   Area will not be less than 5,000 ft x 150 ft. Ski Landing Areas shall be marked as shown in
   Figure 4.4. The primary differences between Skiways and Ski Landing Areas are the
   absence of lead-in flags and, for a Ski Landing Area, fewer skiway flags. A midpoint marker
   will be established by placing red flags at the halfway point (five flags for a Skiway, three
   flags for a Ski Landing Area).
4.6. Surface Preparation and Maintenance. The agency being supported is responsible for
preparing the surface.
   4.6.1. Arctic / Antarctica (other than sea ice) operations on Open Snow, Ski Landing Areas
   and Ski-ways will be authorized by the Deployed Commander in accordance with AFI 11-
   2C-130, Volume 3, C-130 Operations Procedures, and this Instruction.
      4.6.1.1. Dragging is required to remove surface irregularities created by wind action
      (sastrugis) and to promote ice crystal deformation to harden the loose surface snow.
      Various types of drag devices have been successfully used.
      4.6.1.2. The cargo offload/onload area (Figure 4.2) should also be groomed to harden
      the surface prior to supporting cargo offload/onload operations.
      4.6.1.3. Maintaining the Skiway or Ski Landing Area will require periodic dragging. The
      Skiway or Ski Landing Area should be dragged immediately after fresh snow
      accumulation, windstorms or when ski landings/takeoffs have disturbed the surface.
      Regular inspections by the ground party and pilot reports will determine if dragging or
      other maintenance action is required.
   4.6.2. Glacial/Sea Ice Ski Landing Areas must be certified by a SLACO and authorized by
   the Deployed Commander.
      4.6.2.1. Ice irregularities, often hidden by snow cover can do significant damage to skis
      when struck at any speed. An ice crack with an edge of more than 4 inches may do
      damage at taxi speeds as the ski bridges the crack and a stress point is applied to the ski.
      Surface preparation must include a thorough survey of the landing area to look for ice
      irregularities and study snow depths and characteristics. Any unacceptable irregularities
      must be removed. If the resulting surface is acceptable, ski operations can begin after
      appropriate marking and certification. Snow irregularities may be large enough to require
      the entire surface to be dragged or graded to fill low areas and remove high areas. All
      undulating surfaces must be graded to minimize the slope and prevent ski damage. Care
      must be taken not to remove the entire snow surface down to bare ice because snow
      cushions and distributes loads during ski takeoffs and landings.
      4.6.2.2. Cargo offload/onload areas and taxi routes to those areas should be groomed and
      marked as illustrated in Figure 4.2.
      4.6.2.3. Weather and repeated ski operations can deteriorate Skiway surface conditions.
      Daily inspections by the ground party and pilot reports will determine maintenance
      requirements. Daily dragging or grading may be required to maintain an acceptable
      surface. Maintenance of flags and the cargo on/offload area are also required.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                   79


4.7. Flagging Guidance.
   4.7.1. Minimum flagging for a Skiway should consist of the following (Figure 4.1).
      4.7.1.1. Lead-in Flags.
          4.7.1.1.1. A set of four (4) black flags arranged to make a “plus sign” (+) at each
          lead-in flag location.
          4.7.1.1.2. The first set of lead-in flags is located 1,000 ft from the skiway threshold
          along the extended skiway centerline.
          4.7.1.1.3. The second set of lead-in flags will be spaced 500 ft from the first set.
          4.7.1.1.4. The third set of lead-in flags will be spaced 500 ft from the second set.
          4.7.1.1.5. All other sets of lead-in flags will be spaced 1,000 ft apart out to 12,000 ft
          from the skiway threshold to form a two-mile lead-in.
          4.7.1.1.6. This spacing will require thirteen (13) sets of lead-in flags.
      4.7.1.2. Skiway Flags.
          4.7.1.2.1. Three (3) black flags at 400-foot intervals along the full length and on both
          sides of the skiway.
          4.7.1.2.2. Five (5) red flags at the threshold, midpoint, and departure end locations on
          both sides of the skiway.
          4.7.1.2.3. Three (3) “2,000 ft remaining” flags (black with a white number 2) on both
          sides of the skiway at the appropriate distance remaining from each skiway departure
          end.
   4.7.2. Minimum flagging for a Ski Landing Area should consist of the following (Figure
   4.4).
      4.7.2.1. Skiway Flags.
          4.7.2.1.1. Two (2) black flags along the full length of both sides of the ski landing
          area at 500-foot intervals.
          4.7.2.1.2. Three (3) red flags on both sides of the ski landing area at the threshold,
          midpoint, and departure end locations.
          4.7.2.1.3. Two (2) “2,000 ft remaining” flags (black with a white number 2) on both
          sides of the ski landing area at the appropriate distance remaining from each
          departure end.

Terms
Air Component Commander—The Commander Air Force Forces or Joint Force Air
Component Commander; Joint Force Special Operations Component Commander or Joint
Special Operations Air Component Commander.
Airlift Coordination Cell—A cell within the air operations center, which plans, coordinates,
manages and executes theater airlift operations in the area of responsibility or joint operations
 90                                                       AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014


area. Normally consists of an airlift plans branch, an airlift operations branch, and an airlift
logistics branch. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Air Mobility Element—The air mobility element is an extension of the Air Mobility Command
Tanker Airlift Control Center deployed to a theater when requested by the geographic combatant
commander. It coordinates strategic airlift operations with the theater airlift management system
and collocates with the air operations center whenever possible. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Air Mobility Liaison Officer—An air mobility expert permanently assigned to an Army/Marine
installation to support a specific Army/Marine ground maneuver unit.
Airfield Marking Pattern—A system of designations that differentiate between the various
types of airfield markings.
Class D Airspace—Category of controlled airspace, which generally consists of the area from
the surface to 2,500 feet above ground level surrounding airports with an operational tower.
Separation services are provided to visual flight rules aircraft on a workload-permitting basis.
Class G Airspace—Class G airspace (uncontrolled) is that portion of the airspace that has not
been designated as Class A, Class B, Class D, or Class E airspace.
Direct Air Delivery—The strategic air movement of cargo or personnel from an airlift point of
embarkation to a point as close as practicable to the user’s specified final destination, thereby
minimizing transshipment requirements. Direct air delivery eliminaes the traditional Air Force

AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                    91


Helicopter Landing Zone—A specified ground area for landing helicopters to embark or
disembark troops and/or cargo. A landing zone may contain one or more landing sites.
Joint Force Air Component Commander—The commander within a unified command,
subordinate unified command, or joint task force responsible to the establishing commander for
making recommendations on the proper employment of assigned, attached, and/or made
available for tasking air forces; planning and coordinating air operations; or accomplishing such
operational missions as may be assigned. The air component commander is given the authority
necessary to accomplish missions and tasks assigned by the establishing commander.
Joint Force Special Operations Component Commander—The commander within a unified
command, subordinate unified command, or joint task force responsible to the establishing
commander for making recommendations on the proper employment of assigned, attached,
and/or made available for tasking special operations forces and assets; planning and coordinating
special operations; or accomplishing such special operational missions as may be assigned. The
joint force special operations component commander is given the authority necessary to
accomplish missions and tasks assigned by the establishing commander.
Joint Special Operations Air Component Commander—The commander within the joint
force special operations command responsible for planning and executing joint special air
operations and for coordinating and deconflicting such operations with conventional nonspecial
operations air activities. The joint special air operations component commander normally will be
the commander with the preponderance of assets and/or greatest ability to plan, coordinate,
allocate, task, control, and support the assigned joint special operations aviation assets. The joint
special operations air component commander may be directly subordinate to the joint force
special operations component commander or to any non-special operations component or joint
force commander as directed.
Landing Zone—A prepared or semi-prepared (unpaved) airfield used to conduct operations in
an airfield environment similar to forward operating locations. Landing Zone runways are
typically shorter and narrower than standard runways. The amount of engineering effort required
to develop a semi-prepared Landing Zone depends on the planned operation, the service life
needed to support these operations, and the existing soil and weather conditions. Semi-prepared
construction/maintenance preparations may range from those sufficient for limited use to those
required for continuous routine operations. Options for surface preparation may include
stabilization, addition of an aggregate course, compaction of in-place soils, or matting. Since
training airfields are constructed for long-term operations, semi-prepared surface structural
requirements are more stringent than for contingency airfields.
Landing Zone Controller—Individual performing air traffic control duties during landing zone
operations.
Landing Zone Safety Officer—Qualified combat controller, officer aircrew, or qualified
civilian contractor personnel in charge of the landing zone operation.
Mean Effective Wind—A theoretical wind of constant velocity and direction, extending from
the surface to a predetermined altitude above the ground.
Military Free Fall—An employment concept encompassing both high altitude low opening and
high altitude high opening techniques of parachuting.

Military Grid Reference System—The Military Grid Reference System is designed for use
with the Universal Transverse Mercator and Universal Polar Stereographic grids.
Night—The time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil
twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac, converted to local time. (ref AFI 11-202,
Volume 3, General Flight Rules)
Obstruction (or Obstacle)—A natural or man-made object that violates airfield or heliport
clearances, or projects into imaginary airspace surfaces.
Operational Control—Command authority that may be exercised by commanders at any
echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in
combatant command (command authority) and may be delegated within the command. When
forces are transferred between combatant commands, the command relationship the gaining
commander will exercise (and the losing commander will relinquish) over these forces must be
specified by the Secretary of Defense. Operational control is the authority to perform those
functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands
and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary
to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of
military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the
command. Operational control should be exercised through the commanders of subordinate
organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through subordinate joint force commanders
and Service and/or functional component commanders. Operational control normally provides
full authority to organize commands and forces and to employ those forces as the commander in
operational control considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions; it does not, in and of
itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal
organization, or unit training.
Point of Impact—The point on the drop zone where the first parachutist or airdropped cargo
item lands or is expected to land.
Raised Angle Marker—A device used to mark the point of impact during airdrops. A triangular
shaped marker constructed of bright orange material, six feet wide at the base (minimum) and six
feet high (minimum), displayed at a 60-degree angle into the direction of flight.
Ram Air Parachute System—US Army equivalent of a High Glide Ratio Parachute.
Release Point—The point over the drop zone where personnel or equipment should exit the drop
aircraft.
Safety Zone—A distance established by agreement between the air mission commander and the
supported forces’ commander subtracted from the DZ trailing edge to reduce the potential for
off-DZ drops. For peacetime personnel airdrops, the safety zone will never be less than 200
yards. Do not compute safety zone distances for airdrops supporting unconventional warfare
forces as defined by the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plane Annex E, or high altitude low
opening/high altitude high opening airdrops.
Ski Landing Area—A designated area for LC-130 ski operations not meeting the criteria for a
Skiway, but marked and maintained in accordance with this instruction
Skiway—A designated area for LC-130 ski operations marked and maintained in accordance
with this instruction. Skiways must have a published instrument or visual approach procedure
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                  93


and be located near a surface camp with support facilities to include weather reporting, shelter,
first aid, food, communications and grooming on a continual basis.
Skiway Landing Area Control Officer—An experienced LC-130 pilot or combat controller
experienced in LC-130 ski operations responsible for certifying a Skiway Landing Area.

Services designated by the Secretary of Defense and specifically organized, trained, and
equipped to conduct and support special operations.
Special Operations Low Level—C-17 qualified aircrews that support special operations using
non-standard procedures and criteria, including operations using night vision goggles. Air
Mobility Command provides night vision goggle trained C-130 crews capable of using
procedures similar to special operations low-level aircrew.
Special Tactics Team—United States Air Force special operations consisting of combat control,
pararescue, and combat weather personnel who are organized, trained, and equipped to establish
and control the air-ground interface at an airhead in the objective area. Functions include assault
zone reconnaissance and surveillance, establishment, and terminal control; combat search and
rescue; combat casualty care and evacuation staging; special operations terminal attack; and
tactical weather observations and forecasting.
Tactical Air Control Party—A subordinate operational component of a tactical air control
system designed to provide air liaison to land forces and for the control of aircraft.
Trailing Edge of a Drop Zone—Represents the imaginary line extending between the left and
right rear corners of a surveyed drop zone.
Unilateral—Describes an Air Force only operation. A unilateral mission will not be considered
a joint operation merely because the parachutists or loads are from another service. Example: an
Air Force reserve airlift unit conducting training airdrop missions using Army paratroopers or
when Army paratroopers jump with Air Force personnel on an Air Force unit's operation.
Verbally Initiated Release System—A method of positioning aircraft for airdrop by verbal
instruction from the Drop Zone Controller.
Visual Meteorological Conditions—Weather conditions where visual flight rules apply;
expressed in terms of visibility, ceiling height, and aircraft clearance from clouds along the path
of flight. When these criteria do not exist, instrument meteorological conditions prevail and
instrument flight rules must be followed.

      alternate insertion/extraction.
      A6.1.8.2. Block 8C. Enter elevation in feet MSL taken from the HLZ center point.
         A6.1.8.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Use the following square dimensions to determine
         single-ship HLZs: Non-Dust Out CV-22 = 170' (85' rotor diameter), Dust Out CV-22
         = 240' (85' rotor diameter). (T-2)
      A6.1.8.3. Block 8D.
         A6.1.8.3.1. A minimum of two rotor diameters is required for single-ship training.
         Use the following square dimensions to determine single-ship HLZs: MH-53 = 150’
         (72’ rotor diameter); UH-1 = 100’ (48’ rotor diameter); CV-22=170’(85’ rotor
         diameter); HH-60 = 110’ (54’ rotor diameter).
         A6.1.8.3.2. For multiship operations, multiply single-ship dimensions by the number
         of aircraft to determine HLZ capacity (e.g., a 4-ship of MH-53s would require a 600
         ft x 150 ft long HLZ).
         A6.1.8.3.3. For contingency operations use the following dimensions to determine
         single-ship HLZs: MH-53 use 125 ft W x 140 ft L; CV-22 use 135 ft W x 110 ft L;
         HH-60 use 105’ W x 115’ L. UH-1 use 25-foot clearance from any portion of the
         helicopter to the nearest obstacle. For multiship operations, multiply the number of
         aircraft by 150 ft W x 150 ft L (i.e., a 4-ship of MH-53s would require a 600 ft W x
         150 ft L HLZ).
      A6.1.8.4. Block 8E. Annotate obstructions to approach and departure. Use block 9 for
      additional space, and illustrate those obstructions in block 10.
AFI13-217_AFSOCSUP 15 MAY 2014                                                                  105


       A6.1.8.5. Block 8F. Enter degrees of slope based on survey approach axis. Enter upslope
       as "+"; enter downslope as "-". Enter the HLZ right slope in the same manner. For
       example, a +2 to -.5 degrees HLZ indicates a 2-degree upslope and a negative .5-degree
       right downslope on the surveyed approach heading.
          A6.1.8.5.1. MH-53 slope limits: 10 degrees nose up, 8 degrees lateral, nose down
          slope not recommended.
          A6.1.8.5.2. UH-1 slope limits: 10 degrees.
          A6.1.8.5.3. CV-22 slope limits: IAW CV-22 Dash 1 (currently 9 degrees in all
          direction pending further testing).
          A6.1.8.5.3. (AFSOC) CV-22 slope limit: 9 degrees. (T-2)
          A6.1.8.5.4. HH-60 slope limits: 6 degrees nose-down, 15 degrees nose-up, 15
          degrees left/ right. Aircrew will subtract 2 degrees from each limit for each 5 knots of
          wind.
   A6.1.9. Block 9. Enter HLZ surface conditions (e.g. grass asphalt, fine dust, etc.). Exercise
   extreme care to document the possibility of brown/white out conditions, blowing grass, or
   any other flying debris that may restrict visibility or damage aircraft or personnel. Enter other
   remarks as required.
   A6.1.10. Block 10. Provide detailed diagram of the HLZ. A computer-generated diagram is
   desired but not required (See Figure A6.7). At a minimum, display all prominent landmarks
   and man-made or natural features that may help identify the HLZ (i.e. roads, rivers,
   buildings, etc.). Indicate the recommended approach axis and include an arrow designating
   true north. Document and describe all hazards both within the boundaries of the HLZ (e.g.
   rocks, tree stumps, holes, depressions, mounds, fences, poles, trees, wires, ditches, etc.) as
   well as hazards to the approach (e.g. wires, towers, poles, trees). A remark in bold letters
   must be included if the potential for brown/white out conditions exist. Unit HLZs used for
   day-to-day training should include aerial photography and/or imagery. Other HLZ surveys
   should be supplemented with aerial photography and/or imagery whenever possible.
   A6.1.11. Block 11. Annotate if photography is available and attach.

NOTE: When reviewing a foreign HLZ, as much information as possible should be filled in on
the AF Form 4303. At a minimum, the following items must be filled in: Items 4B, 6, 7, and 8. A
copy of the foreign HLZ should be attached to the review.
