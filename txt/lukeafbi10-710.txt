This instruction establishes procedures for implementation of Information Operations Condition
(INFOCON). Program policy and requirements for all information systems, and provides
responsibilities and guidance for establishing and managing the program. It applies to all military
and civilian personnel on Luke Air Force Base (Luke AFB). The INFOCON recommends actions
to uniformly heighten or reduce defensive posture, defend against computer network attacks, and
mitigate sustained damage to the Luke AFB information infrastructure, to include computer and
telecommunications networks and systems. Submit an AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication to the OPR to recommend changes to this publication. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance
with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds_series.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

1. RESPONSIBILITIES.

1.1. Wing Commander: During local INFOCON declaration, the 56th Fighter Wing Commander
(56 FW/CC) has the overall authority for INFOCON implementation on Luke AFB and declares
increases or decreases in INFOCON posture based on hostile network activity directed against the
56 FW and Luke AFB network resources.

1.2. Communications Squadron Commander: The 56th Communications Squadron Commander
(56 CS/CC) is the wing Communications Systems Officer (CSO) and, when appropriate, is
responsible for informing the 56 FW/CC of local or downward directed (AETC) INFOCON status
updates.

1.2.1. For local or downward directed (AETC) INFOCON status updates, the CSO receives
notification from the Communications Focal Point representative, and will contact the
56 FW/CC and 56th Fighter Wing Command Post (56 FW/CP) using reporting procedures
appropriate for the level of threat.

1.3. Communications Focal Point (CFP):

1.3.1. The CFP is the overall point of contact for INFOCON and ensures unit Functional System
Administrators (FSAs) and Client Support Administrators (CSAs) are kept informed of INFOCON
status and threats to Luke AFB systems.

1.3.2. The CFP will:

1.3.2.1. Be the primary focal point for all INFOCON status reporting and will keep the CSO and
561st Network Operations Squadron (561 NOS) Det 2 informed of compliance.

1.3.2.2. Prepare for round-the-clock operations when directed by the CSO.

1.3.2.3. Provide technical assistance to the group FSAs and CSAs.

1.3.2.4. Filter compliance and attainment status reports from FSAs/CSAs and document
compliance of INFOCON checklists.

1.4. Network Operations Center (NOC):

1.4.1. The NOC implements general actions and/or specific measures to increase the security of
the network. Additionally, the NOC provides technical advice and recommendations to the chain
of command.

1.4.2. The NOC will:

1.4.2.1. Provide operational assessment to the CSO during all INFOCON status changes so he/she
can properly brief the 56 FW/CC and obtain approval to release said changes.

1.4.2.2. Prepare for round-the-clock operations when directed by the CSO.

1.5. 56 FW/CP:

1.5.1. 56 FW/CP will inform base personnel of INFOCON status changes.
LUKEAFBI 10-710 4 MAY 2009                                                                 3


1.6. Functional System Administrator (FSA) and Client Support Administrator (CSA):

1.6.1. Network security is a collaborative effort that can impact all users. Through FSAs, CSAs
and network users, unit commanders are responsible for implementing appropriate portions of the
INFOCON checklists and/or any other security measures for their areas of responsibility. FSAs
and CSAs must familiarize themselves and comply with this instruction. In addition, FSAs, CSAs
and network users must understand that in times of increased threat, their ability to carry out
routine duties maybe impacted by the need to protect mission critical systems (Attachment 3).

1.6.2. When directed, FSAs and CSAs will use the INFOCON checklists located on the 56 CS
Share Point page:
https://luke.eis.aetc.af.mil/56MSG/CS/56%20SCO/INFOCON/Forms/AllItems.aspx and
implement immediately upon notification.

1.6.3. Upon notification of INFOCON status change, the FSA/CSA will notify the CFP of
acknowledgment of INFOCON status. When appropriate INFOCON checklist and/or any other
specific security measure is complete, unit FSA/CSAs will notify the CFP of attainment or provide
hourly updates until attainment is reached. In addition, FSAs/CSAs will notify unit Information
System Security Officers (ISSO) of any actions required.

2. NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES.

2.1. Technical reporting will be accomplished IAW INFOCON FSA/CSA checklists.

2.2. During Normal Duty Hours: The CFP and/or NOC will be notified by the Air Force Network
Operations Center/Network Control Division (AFNOC/NCD), 561 NOS Det 2, or exercise
official. The CFP will notify the CSO. The CSO will contact the 56 FW/CC and the 56 FW/CP.
For local INFOCON status, based upon the recommendation from the CSO, the 56 FW/CC will
determine the appropriate INFOCON level. After approval from 56 FW/CC to change INFOCON
level, the 56 FW/CP will notify all units of the INFOCON level. Once units receive notification
that an INFOCON level has been mandated, they will execute the appropriate checklist and/or
security measures.

2.3. During Non-Duty Hours: The CFP and/or 56 FW/CP will be notified by AFNOC or 561
NOS Det 2. The 56 FW/CP will notify the 56 FW/CC and CSO.

2.4. The following telephone extension will be used for INFOCON reporting:

2.4.1. Normal duty hours: 6-4400.

2.4.2. Non-duty hours: 6-4400, option 9.

                               BASIC INFOCON PROCEDURES

 A1.1. DESCRIPTION: The INFOCON system presents a structured, coordinated approach to
defend against and react to adversarial attacks on DoD computer and telecommunication networks
and systems. While all communications systems are vulnerable to some degree, factors such as
low-cost, readily available information technology, increased system connectivity, and standoff
capability make computer network attack (CNA) an attractive option to our adversaries at present.
The DoD INFOCON criteria and response actions may be expanded at a later date to include all
forms of information operations. CNA is defined as “operations to disrupt, deny, degrade, or
destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks
themselves.” INFOCON also outlines countermeasures to scanning, probing, other suspicious
activities, unauthorized access, and data browsing. DoD INFOCON measures focus on computer
network-based protective measures, due to the unique nature of CNA. Each level reflects a
defensive posture based on the risk of impact to military operations through the intentional
disruption of friendly information systems. INFOCON levels are 5 (normal activity), 4 (increased
risk of attack), 3 (specific risk of attack), 2 (limited attack), and 1 (general attack).
Countermeasures at each level include notifications, increased security practices, higher
headquarters reporting, and higher INFOCON review.

A1.2. DEFINITIONS:

A1.2.1. INFOCON 5. Indicates no significant activity.

A1.2.2. INFOCON 4. A heightened threat of a possible information system attack related to
regional events occurring that affect U.S. interests, or on-going or planned military
operations/contingencies, or increased information system probes, scans, or other activities
detected indicating a pattern of surveillance.

A1.2.3. INFOCON 3. Indications & Warnings (I&W) indicate the targeting of a specific system,
location, unit or operation, or a major military operation or contingency is planned or on-going, or
a significant level of network probes, scans or activities has been detected indicating a pattern of
concentrated reconnaissance. Other actions could include attempted or successful network
penetrations or denial of service attempts.

A1.2.4. INFOCON 2. Intelligence assessment(s) and reports indicate a limited attack has
occurred. Information system attack(s) was detected with limited impact to DoD operations.
Attack resulted in minimal success and was successfully counteracted with little or no data loss or
systems compromised. Information system is still mission capable.

A1.2.5. INFOCON 1. Successful information system attack(s) detected and in progress which
impact DoD operations. The attack(s) is widespread and undermines the ability of the targeted
system(s) to function effectively and poses a significant risk of mission failure. Primary efforts
must be focused on recovery and reconstitution of damaged mission critical systems and files.
