This instruction applies to all juveniles who commit offenses on Robins AFB or in privatized
military housing areas and their sponsors. It establishes procedures for disciplinary actions of
offenders who have reached age 13 and are under 18 (excluding spouses). Dependent children

meet the Juvenile Misconduct Review Board (JMRB) on a case-by-case basis as determined by
the Program Chairperson. This instruction is set up under the Installation Commander’s inherent
authority. The procedures established in this instruction do not limit authority otherwise
available under applicable statutes, regulations, instructions, and state law. Refer recommended

3. Juvenile Misconduct Review Board. When a juvenile offender is identified by Security
Forces, he/she will be turned over to his or her sponsor, or a responsible adult, and issued
information letters. (See Attachments 2 and 3 outlining the JMRB procedures.)
   3.1. The JMRB will meet as determined by caseload and type of offense in the WR-ALC/JA
   courtroom (or alternate site). The purpose of the JMRB is to deter future misconduct by the
   juvenile, to rectify any harm done to the Robins AFB community and/or victim(s) of the
   misconduct, and to recommend appropriate discipline if necessary.
       3.1.1. If a JMRB is convened, it will be closed to the public. The chairperson, board
       members, the juvenile’s sponsor, and the juvenile must be present to convene (unless a
       waiver is granted by the chairperson). The chairperson may invite the victim(s) and any
       other relevant guest to the JMRB. Information provided will not be under oath and will
       not be transcribed. The board is required to find that it is more likely than not that the
       alleged offense(s) occurred and to make a recommendation to the chairperson for
       disposition.
       3.1.2. On a case-by-case basis, the board may review videotapes of retail thefts or other
       incidents. In general, videotapes may be reviewed when requested by the parents of the
       juvenile, when the juvenile does not admit to the theft, or when the board is unclear as to
       what occurred. Videotape review is not necessary if the juvenile is found with stolen
       merchandise. The board chairperson will decide when it is necessary for parents to
       review videotapes. All tape reviews will be done in coordination with the legal office
       and Security Forces.

       3.1.3. Boards for shoplifting cases will include, but are not limited to, the chairperson
       (78 MSG/CD) and representatives from 78 SFS, WR-ALC/JA, AAFES or DeCA, and the
       sponsor’s unit. As directed by the chairperson, representatives from other base agencies
       will attend any board session and make recommendations to the chairperson.
       3.1.4. Required membership of all other juvenile misconduct reviews will consist of the
       chairperson, 78 SFS, WR-ALC/JA, and the sponsor’s unit representative. As directed by
       the chairperson, representatives from other base agencies will attend any board sessions
       and make recommendations to the chairperson.
    3.2. The 78 ABW/JA and 78 MSG/CC will review the cases. Cases may be transferred to
    civil authorities at any time. If not transferred, the sponsor will be made aware of the board
    date through command channels.
    3.3. Attendance at the JMRB is mandatory for sponsors, the juvenile in question, and the
    sponsor’s commander or first sergeant, unless an exception is granted from the board
    chairperson via WR-ALC/JA. In circumstances where the military member is unable to
    attend due to mission requirements (e.g., deployed, extended TDY), a non-military parent
    may attend on behalf of the member.         For families with dual military members, the
    sponsoring member is required to attend. The sponsor and the juvenile will have the
    opportunity to make statements if they desire at the board proceedings, and they may review
    the program options (see Attachment 3) that the board is authorized to recommend.
    3.4. The board will recommend to the chairperson actions to be taken and propose possible
    community service.
       3.4.1. Adult supervision for off-base activities directed by the board is the responsibility
       of the sponsor/parent.
       3.4.2. Caseworkers and sponsors will ensure youths are not exposed to hazardous
       environments, adult offenders (suspected or adjudicated), and areas where alcoholic
       beverages or controlled substances are available.
       3.4.3. The sponsor of a juvenile involved in shoplifting is responsible for restitution of
       all merchandise shoplifted.
       3.4.4. The sponsor of a juvenile involved in damaging either government or personal
       property is responsible for restitution for the dollar amount of the damage caused by the
       juvenile.
    3.5. The board chairperson will make the final determination on actions to be taken.
       3.5.1. If the action of the board includes community service or other conditions as the
       consequences of juvenile actions, the juvenile and sponsor/parent will sign the agreement
       (Attachment 4). Failure to accept the terms of the agreement or violating the agreement
       may result in recommendation for further administrative action and referral to civilian
       authorities.
       3.5.2. If community service is assigned on base, a caseworker from a base organization
       may be assigned to track the juvenile’s progress in the program. A sponsor can be
       assigned the responsibility to find the appropriate community service to be completed.
       The sponsor will have the nonprofit organization forward a letter on organizational
       letterhead to WR-ALC/JA, indicating the type of work and number of hours completed.
ROBINSAFBI51-101 13 MAY 2011                                                                    5


   3.6. Any open case, which is not successfully completed, will be reviewed by the board. If
   the juvenile moves out of state prior to completion of the program, the case may be referred
   to civilian authorities or to the sponsor’s gaining commander.
   3.7. The board will review open cases with violated agreements and make recommendations
   for further administrative action to the board chairperson.
4. Appeals. All persons subject to actions under this instruction may appeal final decisions.
   4.1. Submit all appeals in writing to WR-ALC/JA and then to 78 MSG/CC, IN TURN,
   within 10 calendar days of receipt of the board’s decision.
   4.2. The juvenile’s parent or sponsor must originate and sign all appeals. They may include
   supporting letters and other documentation.
   4.3. Appeals are reviewed by the 78 ABW/JA who makes a recommendation to the 78
   MSG/CC for a final decision. After 78 MSG/CC makes a decision, there is no further right of
   appeal.
   4.4. With the written approval of the 78 MSG/CC, the imposition of sanctions can be
   delayed pending resolution of the appeal. Automatic or minimum sanctions covered in other
   instructions, such as loss of driving privileges for DUI or revocation of exchange privileges
   for shoplifting, may not be appealed under JMRB procedures.

      [Building 905, Suite 262]
      Robins AFB GA 31098

SUBJECT: Juvenile Misconduct Review Board (JMRB)

1. As Deputy Mission Support Group Commander at Robins AFB, it is my responsibility to decide on
issues of juvenile misconduct that occur on this base. Air Force Instruction 36-3026, Identification Cards
for Members of the Uniformed Services, Their Eligible Family Members, and Other Eligible Personnel,
and RAFBI 51-101, Juvenile Misconduct Review Board (JMRB), dictate that juveniles who commit acts
of misconduct can have their base privileges suspended, curtailed, or revoked. In extreme or repeated
cases, the juvenile may be barred from Robins AFB, which could prevent the family from residing in base
housing.

2. The Robins Juvenile Misconduct Program is designed to assist in holding juveniles responsible for
their actions and to offer parents a more formal approach to discipline. Cases may be transferred to civil
authorities at any time. The program requires the full support of the parents to be effective. Unless
diverted, each juvenile accused of misconduct will meet the Juvenile Misconduct Review Board, which
will evaluate the case along with any voluntary input from the juvenile and the parents/sponsors. The
board is comprised of various base agencies and will recommend action. It is a rehabilitative program
and usually includes written essay assignments, community service, counseling, and/or loss of privileges
for the youth. Each sanction is based upon the circumstances of the misconduct and any previous history
of misconduct.

3. You will have the opportunity to make a presentation to the board. If a board meeting is scheduled to
review your dependent’s case, you will be notified by mail if civilian, or by your first sergeant or
commander if active duty military. You will be required to attend with your dependent, and if a board
presentation is not possible, you may direct your request for a waiver to the board through
WR-ALC/JA. Active duty members must be in uniform.

4. The Robins Juvenile Misconduct Program is not meant to take your place in disciplining your
dependent, but provides a more formal rehabilitative tool to help you and your dependent. Your active
involvement in this program can weigh heavily in your favor if further disciplinary actions are considered.
If you have any questions or comments concerning the Juvenile Misconduct Program, feel free to call the
legal office at (478) 222-0546.

SUBJECT: Juvenile Misconduct Program Options

1. The Juvenile Misconduct Program offers juveniles accused of misconduct the opportunity to
give back positively to the Robins AFB community. You may suggest the appropriate
consequences for your misconduct. The JMRB may support your request or recommend other
options based on the offense and any history of misconduct. I will make the final decision.
Available options include, but are not limited to:

     a. Community Service. (Examples: yard work or washing police cars.)

     b. Restitution. (Examples: repayment in cash or payment in kind.)

     c. Family counseling and/or individual counseling for family members.

     d. Writing essays or other personal statements.

2. The goal of the board is to help individuals and families deal positively with serious
situations. We want to help, but understand that you must decide help is needed. The choice is
yours!

Dear Mr./Ms. Juvenile

   On behalf of the 78th Air Base Wing Juvenile Misconduct Review Board (JMRB) members, I
