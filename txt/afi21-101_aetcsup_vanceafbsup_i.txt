SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. This revision
clarifies policy and corrects errors in the June 2006 edition. This version incorporates
requirements of PAD 07-13 and subsumes AFIs 21-107 and 21-112. It has been revised in an
effort to be more directive in nature providing the user a clear picture of responsibilities. The
duplication of many requirements listed in both the Combat Wing Organization (CWO) sections
and Air Logistics Centers (ALC)/Aircraft Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC)
sections of the 2006 version have been removed in order to reduce confusion and increase
standardization. Chapter 8 still contains a section applicable just to ALCs but is in addition to the
rest of the chapter. This revision is a complete rewrite.

(AETC) SUMMARY OF CHANGES

(AETC) This interim change includes organization option for Aerospace Ground Equipment
(AGE) flights; updated significant event reporting requirements to include FOD and DOP;
deleted paragraphs 4.2.12.2, 16.12.5 and reference to TO 14D1-2-411; updated parts forecasting
for phase/isochronal inputs; updated links and attachment references; revised E-Tool guidance;
clarified maintenance recovery team requirement to accomplish flight preparedness inspections
when recovering trainer aircraft; changed attachment 16 document file inspection requirement
and note 1; changed attachment 17, item 15 to structural maintenance and removed fabric as an
item.

(VANCEAFB) This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
Major changes include the revisions to Chapters 3, 8, 10, 14.10 and 14.11, and the addition of
Chapter 14.19. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention Program.

                                          Chapter 1

                      MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND POLICY

1.1. Introduction. This instruction prescribes basic aircraft and equipment maintenance policy
and procedures used throughout the USAF. Any deviations from this guidance are prohibited
without Lead Command review and HQ USAF/A4L waiver/variance approval. For the purpose
of this instruction and development of maintenance policy, Lead Commands are Air Combat
Command, Air Mobility Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, Air Education and
Training Command, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve Command, Air Force Space
Command, Air Force Global Strike Command and Air Force Materiel Command. As it pertains
to weapon system specific issues or requirements, AFPD 10-9 takes precedence. For the purpose
of this policy, the term AFMC Single Manager (SM) includes System Program Directors (SPD),
Product Group Managers (PGM) and Supply Chain Managers (SCM),
1.2. Organization. AF wings will organize according to AFI 38-101, AF Organization, or as
authorized by HQ USAF/A1M. Contractor and civil service maintenance functions are not
required to organize in accordance with (IAW) AFI 38-101, but will implement the organization
as outlined in their proposal as accepted by the government.
1.2. (AETC) Organization. Contractor and civil service organizations may delegate functional
program or task responsibility within their maintenance organization where the prescribing
directive states accomplishment by a specific functional area (e.g., Aerospace Vehicle
Distribution Officer, Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D), Maintenance Scheduling
Application Tool (MSAT) administrator). For contractor organizations, functional program and
task delegations shall be coordinated through the government QAE for acceptance or rejection
by the contracting officer (CO). At the discretion of the MXG/CC, Aerospace Ground
Equipment (AGE) flights may organize as a consolidated maintenance unit or may be broken
into teams for concentrated support efforts (see AFI 21-101, paragraph 5.6.1).
1.3. Aircraft and Equipment Readiness. Aircraft and equipment readiness is the maintenance
mission. The maintenance function ensures assigned aircraft and equipment are safe, serviceable,
and properly configured to meet mission needs. Maintenance actions include, but are not limited
to, inspection, repair, overhaul, modification, preservation, refurbishment, troubleshooting,
testing, and analyzing condition and performance. All levels of supervision must place emphasis
on safety, quality, and timeliness in the performance of maintenance. The concept of quality
maintenance must be fostered by each supervisor and technician to ensure the integrity and skill
of each maintainer is not degraded. To the greatest extent possible, maintenance is accomplished
on a preplanned scheduled basis. Planning provides the most effective and efficient use of
people, facilities, and equipment, reduces unscheduled maintenance, and allows for progressive
actions toward maintaining and returning aircraft and equipment to safe operating condition.
Conducting a bench check of components and proper control of repair cycle assets throughout
the maintenance cycle are also critical elements of the equipment maintenance program.
   1.3.1. Preventive Maintenance. AF units must implement and manage the tasks specified in
   the scheduled program for their assigned aircraft and associated support equipment (SE).
   Preventive maintenance concepts are described in TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment
   Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures.
 18                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   1.3.2. Mission Generation maintenance activities must have the capability to launch and
   recover aircraft and sustain the preventive maintenance program. Generally, this means most
   units must possess a complement of equipment and supplies to perform on-equipment and
   off-equipment maintenance.
       1.3.2.1. Off-Equipment Maintenance—Maintenance tasks that cannot be effectively
       accomplished on or at the weapon system or end-item of equipment, but require the
       removal of the component to a shop or facility for repair.
       1.3.2.2. On-Equipment Maintenance—Maintenance tasks that can be effectively
       performed on or at the weapon system or end-item of equipment.
1.4. Maintenance Concept. Maintenance is organized into two mutually supporting networks,
Mission Generation Network (MGN) and Repair Network (RN), The MGN is optimized for
mission generation at the wing level and contains the minimum capabilities required to launch,
recover, configure, inspect and repair aircraft. The RN supports the MGN by providing
serviceable components/equipment and conducting inspection, repair, and modification of
aircraft and equipment.
   1.4.1. Requests For Assistance (RFA). If a maintenance activity requires assistance for
   evaluation and/or repair beyond unit capability, the request must be made IAW AFI 21-103,
   Equipment Inventory, Status And Utilization Reporting, TO 00-25-107, Maintenance
   Assistance, and TO 00-20-14, AF Metrology and Calibration Program, or automated process
   as approved by the mission design series (MDS) specific system manager (e.g., C-130
   AIRCATS, F-16 TAR). All requests for assistance must be coordinated through the Quality
   Assurance (QA) office and Maintenance Operations Squadron (MOS) Plans, Scheduling and
   Documentation (PS&D).
   1.4.1. (AETC) Provide information copies to the MAJCOM functional manager. Note: Any
   request involving waivers, changes in technical data, or requiring MAJCOM funding must be
   routed to the MAJCOM functional manager for coordination and approval with appropriate
   MAJCOM offices.
1.4. (AETC) Maintenance Concept. The 33 Fighter Wing, F-35 aircraft maintenance concept
was procured as a Performance Based Logistics concept; therefore, not all operations or
functions will be managed the same as a typical Combat Wing Organization.
1.5. Maintenance Discipline. It is the responsibility of all maintenance personnel to comply
with all written guidance to ensure required repairs, inspections, and documentation are
completed in a safe, timely, and effective manner. Supervisors are responsible for enforcing and
establishing a climate that promotes maintenance discipline.
   1.5.1. Compliance Terminology. For the purposes of this instruction, the following
   definitions apply:
       1.5.1.1. Shall, Must, Will - Indicate mandatory requirements. (Will is also used to
       express a declaration of purpose for a future event.)
       1.5.1.2. Should - Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.
       1.5.1.3. May - Indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                19


1.5. (AETC) Maintenance Discipline. Aircraft maintainers are faced with many challenges to
include fewer people, merging career fields, increased mission requirements, older fleets and
new aircraft growing pains making maintenance discipline ever more important. Maintenance
discipline and/or basic maintenance practices, which include compliance with safety, technical
data/policy, documentation and training requirements, are essential to ensuring a sound
maintenance organization. All personnel must focus on an attitude of ―doing the job right, the
first time, even when no one is watching‖.
1.6. Use of Technical Orders (TO) and TO Supplements. Use of the prescribed technical
data to maintain aircraft and equipment is mandatory.
   1.6.1. Units/Supervisors will:
       1.6.1.1. Strictly enforce adherence to and compliance with TOs and supplements.
       1.6.1.2. Establish and manage TOs and supplements IAW TO 00-5-1, AF Technical
       Order System
       1.6.1.3. Establish procedures for shipping TOs, E-Tools, and support equipment
       associated with E-Tools to support mobility requirements.
       1.6.1.4. Ensure all authorized technical data variances are kept with aircraft/equipment
       historical records until no longer applicable.
   1.6.2. All personnel will:
       1.6.2.1. Recommend improvements or corrections for TO deficiencies IAW TO 00-5-1.
       The AFTO IMT 22 prescribed in TO 00-5-1 may be submitted as an attachment to an e-
       mail to report problems of a TO. Official TO updates are the only valid authority for
       correcting a technical deficiency and implementing change.
       1.6.2.2. Continually assess the currency, adequacy, availability, and condition of their
       TOs and supplements.
       1.6.2.3. Ensure waivers to, deviations from, or additional technical data procedures are
       issued using approved official communication methods (e.g., signed letter, organizational
       E-mail, AMHS message or authorized automated TO 00-25-107 technical assistance
       request system, or applicable guidance from ALC). Ensure all authorized technical data
       variances are kept with aircraft/equipment historical records until no longer applicable.
   1.6.3. Lead Command will ensure any new or modified configurations or maintenance
   conditions are coordinated with, and approved by, the designated Weapons System Lead
   Command IAW AFPD 10-9 and the System Program Manager (SPM) responsible for the
   operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness (OSS&E) of the systems and end-items prior
   to implementation.
1.7. Publications. Lead Commands will supplement this AFI. Units must tailor procedures to
the unique aspects of their own maintenance operation and publish directives (instructions,
supplements, and, for functional areas, operating instructions IAW AFI 33-360), for areas where
more detailed guidance or specific procedures will enhance operations. Units shall adhere to the
following procedures:
   1.7.1. Do not publish unit instructions or Operating Instructions (OI) to change or
   supplement TOs. Units must use procedures in TO 00-5-1 to update TOs.
 20                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   1.7.2. Coordinate directives with all appropriate unit agencies.
   1.7.3. Conflicts between administrative and technical publications will be resolved in favor
   of the technical publication.
   1.7.4. Conflicts between procedural technical publications and weapon system specific
   technical publications will be resolved in favor of the weapon system specific technical
   publication.
   1.7.5. Conflicts between Air National Guard/AF Reserve and AF publications are resolved
   IAW AFI 33-360.
   1.7.6. Develop, control, and maintain technical data checklists IAW Chapter 8 of this
   instruction, TO 00-5-1, and Lead Command instructions.
   1.7.7. Develop, control, and maintain functional checklists. Functional Checklists are not
   formatted IAW TO 00-5-1 and Chapter 8 of this instruction, but at a minimum are titled and
   dated. Functional checklists are required for use by functional area(s) during actions such as
   aircraft crash, mass loads, severe weather warning or evacuation, self-inspections, activity
   inspections, etc. Functional checklists shall not be used in place of or to circumvent
   technical data for operation, servicing, inspection or maintenance of aircraft, aircraft
   systems and all other equipment supporting aircraft and munitions maintenance. QA will
   ensure functional checklists are reviewed every two years for currency and document this
   review.
   1.7.7. (AETC) See paragraph 6.2.2.10.1 for additional requirements on functional
   checklists developed by the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC).
1.7. (AETC) Publications. AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, prohibits
contractors from serving as points of contact (POC) for Air Force instructions. For contract
maintenance units, the Wing/CC will appoint a military or civilian POC to develop wing
instructions required by AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management.
1.8. Waiver Request. MAJCOMs are not permitted to deviate from this instruction without
receiving written approval from HQ USAF/A4L. Units must submit waiver requests through the
Lead Command. Waivers should only be submitted when urgent or immediate action is required.
These circumstances are usually mission impacting and cannot be submitted as part of the
normal AFI change process. See Attachment 10 for template.
1.8. (AETC) Waiver Request. Units will submit waiver requests to the Maintenance Division
(HQ AETC/A4M), using AETC Form 1236, Request for Improving/Changing AETC
Maintenance Publications.
1.9. Operating Instructions (OI). OIs are not published to change AF instructions, policy or
TOs. Publish MX OIs IAW AFI 33-360. When crossing group lines, OIs must be coordinated
and approved by the affected commanders and published as wing instructions. Wing instructions
will be published when expanded guidance encompasses other group responsibilities, for
example: OG, MXG, MSG, etc. The MXG QA will be the OPR for maintenance policy guidance
and consolidation. IAW AFI 33-360, units may supplement this instruction in lieu of creating
individual OIs as mandated in this instruction.
   1.9.1. QA will review all OIs every 2 years for accuracy, intent and necessity and document
   this review. (ALC the MXW Management Operations Office will perform this function)
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 21


   1.9.2. The appropriate Safety activity will review OIs affecting munitions operations or
   safety; including all locally developed checklists, instructions, supplements, plans, or
   operating procedures relating to nuclear surety IAW AFI 91-101, AF Nuclear Weapons
   Surety Program.
   1.9.3. (Added-AETC) Contractor regulations (CRs) are developed by the contractor to
   implement requirements of the contract and they apply solely to the contractor. They are not
   published to change or supplement technical orders (TO). As a minimum, forward CRs to the
   chief quality assurance evaluator (QAE), functional director, or commander, and ACO for
   review and acceptance prior to publication.
1.9. (AETC) Operating Instructions (OI). Units are not required to develop OIs for programs
not applicable to their unit (e.g., high-speed taxi checks, emergency war orders (EWO) and
combat turnaround).
1.10. Performance-Based Activities. This section identifies the basic responsibilities for
managing performance-based activities (e.g., contract maintenance, Most Efficient Organization
(MEO), or High Performance Organization (HPO) except DoD High Performing Organization
Pilot program under section 337 of the NDAA 2004 (Public Law 108-136) which will follow
DoDI 4100). Additional guidance may be found in AFI 63-124, Performance-Based Services
Acquisition (PBSA) and AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program. Note: By definition, a
contractor, MEO, or HPO will be referred to as a service provider.
   1.10.1. Lead Command/MAJCOM Responsibilities:
       1.10.1.1. Designate focal points for organizational, functional, and technical questions
       pertaining to each performance-based activity program.
       1.10.1.1. (AETC) The Program Management Flight (HQ AETC/A4PM) and HQ
       AETC/A4M are AETC focal points for contract and civil service aircraft and trainer
       maintenance programs.
       1.10.1.2. Specify measurement areas and performance levels required for aircraft,
       systems, and equipment operated or maintained by performance-based activities.
       1.10.1.2. (AETC) The applicable contract will contain measurement areas and standards
       of performance.
       1.10.1.3. Specify the forms, methods of documentation, and frequency of reporting used
       to assess performance-based activities and ensures these requirements are included in the
       Performance Management Assessment Program (PMAP).
       1.10.1.4. Approve base-level requests that would permit a single Federal Aviation
       Administration (FAA) certified Airframe/Powerplant (A/P) contractor technician
       maintaining contracted logistics support (CLS) aircraft to repair and sign off their own
       Red X’s when sent to recover aircraft off-station.
       1.10.1.5. Identify the qualifications, training requirements, and responsibilities for QAE
       personnel assigned to surveil performance-based activities.
       1.10.1.6. Ensure units with assigned QAE personnel meet requirements of AFI 63-124
       along with other applicable guidance.
 22                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


       1.10.1.7. Ensure aircraft depot maintenance contracts, Statements of Work (SOW), and
       Performance Work Statement (PWS) are coordinated with the MAJCOM Munitions
       Functional to ensure munitions accountability and disposition requirements are adhered
       to.
   1.10.2. Unit Responsibilities:
       1.10.2.1. Designate a focal point for all functional, technical, and QAE matters
       pertaining to performance-based activities.
       1.10.2.2. Designate a MXG focal point (e.g., Environmental Coordinator) for all
       Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health requirements, compliance, and, as
       appropriate, worker protection issues affecting performance-based activities. The
       Environmental Coordinator will perform duties as outlined in AFPD 90-8, Environment,
       Safety, and Occupational Health/AFI 32-7080, Pollution Prevention Program and AFI
       32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management.
       1.10.2.3. In coordination with the contracting officer and the MXG/CC (or equivalent),
       provide specific guidance to the performance-based activity to ensure proper maintenance
       discipline and flight worthiness of aircraft and subsystems.
       1.10.2.4. Develop and publish contingency procedures for support of continuing
       operations in the event of disruption, termination, or default of contract. This includes
       the provision of contingency procedures for the accomplishment of critical mission
       operations in the aftermath of natural or man-made events such as natural disasters, major
       accidents, and terrorist attacks involving chemical, biological, or radiological materials.
1.11. Modification Management. A modification proposal is a recommendation to change the
operation, use, or appearance of AF equipment. Modifications (temporary, permanent, or safety)
to AF aircraft or equipment are expressly prohibited without SPM approval. Refer to AFI 63-
1101, Modification Program Management, for modification management procedures.
   1.11.1. In addition to requirements set forth in AFI 63-101, temporary modifications
   extending beyond a 12 month period will not be maintained by government employees unless
   verified red-line technical data is available.
   1.11.2. Modifications to Munitions. All proposed modifications to aircraft-carried munitions
   shall include SEEK EAGLE certification (per AFI 63-104, The SEEK EAGLE Program). All
   modifications to AF nuclear munitions or their associated support/training equipment shall be
   nuclear certified IAW AFI 91-103, AF Nuclear Safety Design Certification Program. All
   modifications to AF conventional munitions or their associated support/training equipment
   shall be certified IAW AFI 91-205, Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board.
1.11. (AETC) Modification Management. The Aircraft Maintenance Branch (HQ
AETC/A4MA) and Systems Support Branch (HQ AETC/A4MS) are the AETC focal points for
aircraft, engines, avionics and support equipment. Munitions/Weapons Section (HQ
AETC/A4MSW) is the AETC focal point for weapons, munitions and associated support
equipment.
1.12. Maintenance Information Systems (MIS). MIS refers to automated maintenance
information systems that support and enable maintenance business processes. MIS will be used
to document maintenance actions and determine fleet health. The information entered into the
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                   23


MIS must match the content of aircraft forms. MIS data entries do not have to be accomplished
by the same individual who documented the aircraft forms, but employee number/man
number/USERID of person accomplishing the actual work must be input into the MIS. Red Ball
maintenance will be documented IAW chapter 14 of this instruction.
   1.12.1. Units must use approved MIS portfolio which may be viewed by accessing the
   Enterprise Information Technology Database Repository located on the AF Portal. If a unit
   desires to use a system other than the authorized standard MIS the unit must submit a request
   to their Lead Command 3-digit Maintenance Management Division (i.e., A4M or A4Q).
   Lead Command 3-digit functional managers shall coordinate on all requests and forward
   through the Lead Command A4 to HQ USAF/A4L for final consideration/approval. Upon
   receipt of A4L approval request for MIS systems procurement must be done through the
   AF/A4RB process.
1.12. (AETC) Maintenance Information Systems (MIS). Although information entered into
the MIS must match the content of equipment forms, it does not imply that the information must
match word for word. The intent is that the information in equipment forms is consistent with
the information in the MIS.
1.13. Communications. Effective maintenance requires efficient communication. Radios must
be available to expedite personnel, equipment, material, and maintenance data throughout the
maintenance complex. Unit commanders shall develop communication plans according to
mission requirements.
   1.13.1. Lead Commands will develop guidance on the use and proper control of personal
   electronic and communication devices (i.e. cell phones, pagers, portable music/video players,
   electronic games) on the flightline, in munitions areas, hangars, and/or other industrial work
   areas.
   1.13.1. (AETC) Personal (non-government issue) electronic and communication devices
   (for example, cell phones, pagers, portable music/video players, electronic games) are not
   authorized on the flight line, munitions maintenance areas, hangars and (or) other industrial
   work areas unless the MXG/CC, or respective maintenance authority (MA) authorizes key
   personnel their use for the performance of official business.
1.14. Duty Shifts and Rest Periods. During normal operations, maintenance personnel will be
scheduled for duty based on a goal of a 40-hour work week. Maintenance personnel will have
their duty hours aligned to provide the best mission support. Consider climatic conditions when
determining work schedules; local work/rest schedules for extreme temperatures are
recommended by the Medical Group commander.
   1.14.1. Supervision at all levels will be equitably distributed to cover all duty periods.
   1.14.2. The following guidance establishes maximum duty periods and minimum rest
   periods for all personnel assigned to a maintenance activity. MXG/CCs may waive the
   following provisions during emergencies and advanced readiness conditions. Duty periods
   for crew chiefs and maintenance technicians traveling in their units’ aircraft are normally
   controlled by the aircraft commander.
   1.14.3. Duty time begins when personnel report for duty (this includes aircraft showtime)
   and ends when their supervisor releases them. A rest period is a block of time that gives a
 24                              AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   person the opportunity for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep in a 24-hour period. (Note:
   This rest period may not be waived for exercises or inspections.)
   1.14.4. Do not schedule personnel for more than 12 hours of continuous duty time. Provide a
   rest period after each shift. Time spent in exercise/contingency deployment processing lines
   and in-transit counts toward the total duty day, and may impact time available to perform
   maintenance at the destination.(This includes Flying Crew Chiefs (FCC), Mission Essential
   Personnel (MEP), Maintenance Recovery Teams (MRT), and normal deployment travel).
   MXG/CCs are final approval authority for exceeding 12-hour limit up to a maximum of 16
   hours. AC/Detachment CC assumes this responsibility in deployed/travel status.
   1.14.5. Personnel will not handle, load or perform maintenance on nuclear weapons,
   conventional munitions and/or egress explosives beyond a 12-hour continuous duty period.
   This requirement may not be waived for exercises or inspections; however, the 12-hour
   continuous duty period may be exceeded for shift turnover/administrative actions only and
   will be avoided to the maximum extent possible. The Group Commander or equivalent may
   waive this requirement during advance defense readiness conditions, actual emergencies as
   defined in DoD Directive 3150.2, DoD Nuclear Weapons System Safety Standards, or to
   resolve an unexpected event (e.g.; disabled vehicle, WS3 fault, hoist failure, etc…).
   1.14.6. In alert force or standby duty situations where facilities are available for resting,
   established norms may be exceeded. Adjust rest periods to allow for at least 8 hours of sleep.
   1.14.7. Ensure individuals are afforded adequate rest periods and breaks. Consider climatic
   conditions when determining work schedules. Stop anyone if fatigue may jeopardize safety.
   In all cases, aircraft commanders/supervisors ensure aircraft maintenance personnel are not
   required to perform duty when they have reached the point of physical or mental fatigue
   rendering them incapable of performing their assigned duties safely and reliably.
1.15. Maintenance Training. Maintenance training provides initial, recurring and advanced
proficiency, qualification, or certification skills needed by a technician to perform duties in their
primary AF Specialty Code (AFSC)/Civilian Job Series. Provide training in combat and sortie
generation skills not normally integrated into peacetime operations (e.g., munitions and external
fuel tank build-up, hot refueling). When balancing resources, (e.g., aircraft, support equipment,
facilities, tools, funding, personnel), maintenance training carries an equal priority with the
operational training mission. For maintenance training policy and guidance, refer to AFI 36-
2232, Maintenance Training and Lead Command directives.
   1.15.1. Cross-Utilization Training (CUT). CUT provides the unit internal flexibility by
   training individuals to perform tasks that are outside their primary AFSC. CUT is not a long-
   term fix or management solution for an AFSC shortfall. Ensure the training records of
   individuals receiving CUT are appropriately documented. Address questions regarding CUT
   to the applicable MAJCOM AFSC Functional Manager.
   1.15.1. (AETC) The Maintenance Requirements Section (HQ AETC/A4MMR) is the
   AETC office of primary responsibility (OPR).
   1.15.2. For emerging weapon systems, extensive CUT may be necessary until proper
   workforce AFSC balancing and assignment is achieved. MAJCOM Functional managers will
   closely monitor the effects of CUT for adverse trends. Note: Prohibitions in this guidance do
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 25


   not apply to UAS (Predator/Global Hawk) weapon systems or other weapon systems where
   the AF approved maintenance philosophy dictates the merger of AFSCs.
   1.15.3. Weapons Load Training (WLT). Weapons standardization provides initial and
   recurring weapons load training and certification.
   1.15.3. (AETC) Explosives Operations Training. Maintenance Training Flights (MTF) will
   provide training on the requirements of TO 11A-1-33, Handling and Maintenance of
   Explosives Loaded Aircraft, to all personnel involved in explosives-loaded aircraft
   operations. MTFs will provide initial training before personnel work on explosives-loaded
   aircraft and annually thereafter. Note: 2W0XX and 2W1XX personnel who have received
   weapons and explosives safety training from other sources (such as weapons academics or
   explosives safety training per AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program)
   are exempt from this training.
1.15. (AETC) Maintenance Training. See AETCI 21-103, AETC Military Aircraft
Maintenance Training Program, or AETCI 21-112, AETC Civil Service and Contractor Aircraft
Maintenance Training Programs, for AETC training instructions.
1.16. Maintenance Resource Management (MRM). MRM is a course designed to immerse
all personnel into the culture and knowledge of human factors philosophy focusing on the
importance, requirements, and implementation of MRM principles into daily maintenance
activities. Error reduction efforts through human factors will be used to improve processes,
reduce maintenance errors, decrease maintenance induced damage, and decrease on-the-job-
injuries. This will be done by integrating the technical skills of maintenance personnel with
interpersonal skills and basic human factors knowledge along with operational risk management
in order to improve communication, effectiveness, and safety in maintenance operations.
   1.16.1. To facilitate our common MRM culture, the Air Force’s Core MRM course will
   consist of a one-time, 4-hour block of instruction taught by a certified MRM facilitator using
   the mandatory course material currently documented at the MRM CoP,
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-AN-83. To meet the
   needs of our total force, MAJCOMS have the option of supplementing the course, in both
   frequency and duration, to meet unique unit and mission requirements. MAJCOMs can
   further delegate individual MXG/CCs the authority to supplement their MRM courses to
   address local, base-level requirements.
   1.16.2. MRM training is required at all stateside and overseas long-tour locations and will be
   taught to all military personnel serving in maintenance organizations. MAJCOMs will
   determine the applicability and requirement for MRM training for contractors, government
   civilians, and AF military personnel possessing a maintenance AFSC but performing duties
   in a non-maintenance role. Because of the challenges posed by wholesale manpower
   rotations, MRM training is not required at short-tour locations; however, these units will
   advocate MRM to the maximum extent possible in order to strengthen the cultural changes
   MRM requires to succeed.
   1.16.2. (AETC) Maintenance Resource Management (MRM). MRM is applicable to all 2A,
   2W, 21A, 21M, and 2P personnel (this includes personnel in QA, MTF, and other MXG staff
   agencies). MRM is not applicable to 3A0s, 3S2s and 2R0/2R1s. Contractors, MEO’s and
 26                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


    civil service organizations are not required to implement MRM, but may choose to
    accomplish the training at no additional cost to the government.
    1.16.3. The AF/A4L appointed OPR will:
       1.16.3.1. Conduct annual course reviews to ensure currency of MRM course content.
       1.16.3.2. Coordinate course updates with HQ AFSC (AF Safety Center)/SEFO and
       AFSC/SEFL for subject matter expertise, to include those areas such as human factors,
       fatigue, etc, and for current safety statistics.
       1.16.3.3. Ensure current course content is available on the MRM CoP.
    1.16.4. MAJCOM A4s will:
       1.16.4.1. Assign an MRM OPR and identify the OPR POC to AF/A4LM.
       1.16.4.1. (AETC) The office of responsibility for MRM is HQ AETC/A4MMR.
    1.16.5. MXG/CC
       1.16.5.1. Encourage training participation and attendance by other base agencies.
       1.16.5.2. When practical, ensure classes are populated with a mixture of AFSs, skill
       levels and ranks from across the MXG to maximize benefits of course discussions.
       1.16.5.3. Ensure course completion is tracked in the applicable MIS.
1.17. Maintenance Repair Priorities. Maintenance repair priorities are listed in Table 1.1.
This does not prohibit the Production Superintendent, in coordination with the Maintenance
Operations Center (MOC), from changing the maintenance repair priority when warranted.
Raising or lowering maintenance repair priorities does not necessarily require a corresponding
change in the Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) delivery priority. During Operational Plan
(OPLAN) 8010 or operational exercise, the preplanned maintenance flow determines job
sequence. The maintenance repair priority and LRS delivery priorities are normally identical.
However, the Production Superintendent may authorize the use of a less responsive LRS delivery
priority.

Table 1.1. Maintenance Repair Priority Designators.

1.18. AF Munitions Policy. AF Munitions Policies are contained in AFI 21-200, Munitions
and Missile Maintenance Management, AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance
Management and AF Nuclear Munitions Policy is contained in AFI 21-204, Nuclear Weapons
Maintenance Procedures. Lead Commands will develop and provide policy and guidance on
managing and limiting munitions use as necessary . This will ensure munitions remain available
 28                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


and in reliable condition and at the same time provide a realistic training environment and
support for exercise purposes.
   1.18.1. Live and inert missiles (or electrical simulators) of the same type must not be loaded
   or flown together on an aircraft for any purpose. Live and inert (to include training or
   practice) bombs must not be loaded in/on the same dispenser/rack or flown on an aircraft
   load together. Any request to deviate from or waiver to this policy must be coordinated
   through the WWM, and must be submitted via official message to the MAJCOM Munitions
   Division, Weapons Safety, and Operations Weapons and Tactics/Training Divisions. The
   MAJCOM Munitions Division is the sole approval authority for these deviations/waivers.
   Test organizations may load and fly live and inert munitions on the same aircraft for test
   missions only, as long as the flight profile is IAW an approved test directive that has been
   through a Safety Review Board process and flight clearance through the applicable System
   Program Office SPO/Seek Eagle office has been properly obtained.
   1.18.2. Request for waiver of, or deviation to, this policy will include as a minimum: 1).
   Operational Risk Assessment report and proposed controls to mitigate or eliminate hazards to
   personnel, damage to aircraft and support equipment or inadvertent employment of live
   ordnance, and, 2). A signed copy of the Test Requirement Plan, Test Plan, or Concept
   Employment Plan. Approved requests will remain valid only for the event requested and will
   not exceed 60 days.
   1.18.3. Captive Air Training Munitions (CATM): Safety pins/streamers for arming
   keys/safe-arm handles on CATMs may be removed for daily training/flying operations
   provided positive control and accountability is maintained for these items. (Note: AIM-9M
   CATM arming handles will be permanently removed). MXG/CC may authorize removal of
   additional components (i.e.; wings, fins, etc.) for daily training/flying operations provided
   CATMs are flown in an authorized flight configuration (Seek Eagle) IAW applicable MDS -
   1 flight manuals. These components are only removed for foreign or dropped object
   prevention. Any CATM missiles used for exercises, Load Crew Training and inspections will
   be configured to the maximum extent possible with all safety devices and components to
   mirror the parent tactical munitions.
1.18. (AETC) AF Munitions Policy. See AFI 21-201/AETC Sup 1, Conventional Munitions
Maintenance Management, for AETC guidance.
1.19. Unit Committed Munitions List (UCML), Test/Training Munitions List
(TTML). Operational units will use UCML’s, Test/Training (AETC and AFMC only (includes
ARC gained units in these commands)) will use TTML’s unless they already require a UCML
(i.e., NORAD Committed). The UCML/TTML is a list of primary munitions (PM), support
munitions (SM), and limited-use munitions (LM) necessary to meet unit operational/test/training
requirements and is published IAW this instruction. The list of PM cannot include more than 10
individual munitions or munitions family groups (MFG) combined per mission, design, and
series (MDS) aircraft assigned. The UCML/TTML also specifies the minimum certified load
crews required to meet unit requirements. MAJCOMS may supplement UCML/ TTML
processing, coordination and appendix requirements.
   1.19.1. As a minimum, UCML/TTML’s will be updated annually to identify all munitions
   tasked and/ or required to support test/training or OPLANs and Designed Operational
   Capability (DOC) statements. Additional munitions may be included on the UCML/TTML as
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                  29


   SM or LM munitions if required by the unit or designated by the MAJCOM (A4M performs
   this in the ANG) to support test, training, or deployment. The UCML/TTML is the base
   document for aircrew and load crew training munitions forecasts, authorizations and
   operations. Units will start their UCML/TTML validation in July, and have a coordinated
   input to the MAJCOM Munitions Division in August. MAJCOMs will supply approved
   UCML/TTML to the units in September. Note: Specified months not applicable to ANG
   process.
   1.19.1. (AETC) (Eglin, Luke and Tyndall AFBs only) The wing weapons manager will
   develop the unit committed munitions list (UCML) and test/training munitions list (TTML).
   1.19.2. Unit changes to the UCML/TTML will be justified by Wing Weapons and Tactics,
   coordinated and processed through the WWM, Munitions Flight, MXG/CC and OG/CC
   before sending it to higher headquarters and MAJCOM.
   1.19.2. (AETC) (Eglin, Luke and Tyndall AFBs only) Units will notify HQ
   AETC/A4MSW of any significant mission, contingency tasking, or munitions changes that
   may affect the UCML/TTML.
   1.19.3. Standard Conventional Load (SCL) lists are not part of the UCML/TTML. They are
   stand-alone documents.
   1.19.4. The WWM determines the minimum number of certified load crews depicted on the
   UCML based on Unit Type Code (UTC) requirements identified in applicable DOC
   statements. The WWM determines the number of load crews depicted on the TTML as
   required to meet training unit syllabus and/or test unit mission requirements. (Note: WWM
   specifies in writing the minimum number of load crews required in aggressor units when no
   UCML/TTML exists).
1.20. Associate Unit Program/Total Force Integration (TFI). The USAF employs the
Associate Unit/TFI program in some locations where active and ARC units are collocated and
share aircraft, equipment, facilities, and other resources IAW AFPD 90-10, Total Force
Integration Policy. Lead Command maintenance policy directives and enforcement as it pertains
to aircraft, equipment, and facilities. (i.e. ANG owns the aircraft in an active duty association,
ANG maintenance policy will be followed by AD personnel, AFRC owns the aircraft in an ANG
association, AFRC maintenance policy will be followed by ANG personnel, AD owns the
aircraft in an ANG/AFRC association, AD maintenance policy will be followed by ANG/AFRC
personnel)
1.21. Civilian Visitors. Units will not permit civilian visitors to operate any AF equipment,
specialized vehicles, and any other equipment that requires training to operate, unless they have
been specifically trained in the operation of such equipment. (see AFI 24-301 for AF vehicle
operation requirements.)
   1.21.1. Civilian visitors include:
       1.21.1.1. AF family members who are not employed by the AF or assigned to a military
       service.
       1.21.1.2. All civilians who are visiting another unit/installation and are not performing

                                              SAFETY

2.1. General Safety Guidance. Maintenance personnel are exposed to a large variety of
hazardous situations, machinery, equipment, and chemicals. Most hazardous situations can be
avoided by following procedures, asking for help when needed, and using personal protective
equipment (PPE). Supervisors must be knowledgeable of and enforce AFOSHSTDs, TOs, and
AFIs applicable to their operations and ensure personnel are educated on safety requirements
applicable to the job.
2.2. Air Force Occupational and Health (AFOSH) Guidance. Use AF functional directives
and technical data in conjunction with AFOSH STDs, see Attachment 1 for AFOSHSTDs
applicable to aircraft maintenance activities (this list is not all inclusive). If conflicting guidance
exists, the weapon system specific technical data will take precedence.
2.3. Hazards. All managers and supervisors must incorporate Operational Risk
Management (ORM) within the workplace. Identify, eliminate or control, and document
hazards to minimize risk associated with uncertainty in the decision-making process. Additional
guidance can be found in AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Management, and AFPAM 90-902,
Operational Risk Management Guidelines and Tools. When written directives are not available
for the task being performed, the supervisor, with safety staff help, completes a job safety
analysis (JSA) to ensure worker, equipment, and work environment compatibility. Procedures for
JSAs are contained in AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire
Protection, and Health (AFOSH).
2.4. Hazard Abatement Program. Implement and follow the AF Hazard Abatement Program
in AFI 91-301. Document safety plans, actions, hazards, and personnel training with the
appropriate AF forms listed below.
   2.4.1. AF IMT 3, Hazard Abatement Plan; AFI 91-301.
   2.4.2. AF IMT 55, Employee Safety and Health Record; AFI 91-301.
   2.4.3. AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report; AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
   Prevention Program.
   2.4.4. AF Form 1118, Notice of Hazard; AFI 91-301.
2.5. Safety Equipment. Ensure personnel are provided the appropriate PPE (when PPE is
required) for the hazard and are trained in its use, inspection and care. Contact the installation
ground safety or Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) for assistance in the selection of PPE.
Review AFOSH 91-501 for additional information on PPE.
2.6. AF Mishap Prevention Program. Implement and follow AFI 91-202 to protect AF
resources. Ensure all personnel receive safety, fire protection, and health on-the job training upon
initial assignment and whenever there is a change in equipment, procedures, processes or safety,
fire protection, and health requirements. Supervisors must document safety-related training on
AF IMT 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, equivalent form or electronic database.
2.7. Safety Inspections. Accomplish hazard assessment and identification through the
application of occupational safety, fire prevention, and health inspections, evaluations, and
 32                             AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


surveys. Supervisors will perform self-inspections to assess the safety environment of the unit.
Most AFOSHSTDs contain sample checklists for unit self-inspections. Also, use locally
developed checklists tailored to specific unit requirements.
2.8. Flightline Safety. Adhere to aircraft flightline safety guidance in AFOSHSTD 91-100;
Aircraft Flightline-Ground Operations and Activities, AFOSHSTD 48-20, Occupational Noise
and Hearing Conservation Program, TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static
Grounding/Bonding; and equipment TOs.
2.9. Flightline Driving. All operators of vehicles on the flightline must first obtain training and
possess a valid flightline driving permit. Follow the general safety requirements for flightline
vehicle operations found in AFOSHSTD 91-100 and AFJMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled
Vehicle Driver, AFI 13-213, Airfield Management, and local instructions. Supervisors will
familiarize all personnel authorized to operate vehicles on the flightline with the aircraft
marshaling signals found in AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground.
Note: see AFI 24-301 for AF vehicle operation requirements.
   2.9.1. Operators must receive flightline driver's training on driving conditions and hazards
   inherent to the flightline environment and obtain a flightline competency card prior to
   operating any vehicle or equipment operated like a vehicle (bomb lifts, club cars, gators,
   mules, golf carts, etc.) on the flightline, even though these equipment items do not require a
   driver’s permit or license.
2.10. Work Center Safety Guidance. Use the general work center safety guidance in
AFOSHSTD 91-66, General Industrial Operations and AFSOSHSTD 91-501, AF Consolidated
Occupational Safety Standard, equipment TOs, and local instructions.
2.11. Confined Spaces. A confined space is any area that is large enough to bodily enter; and
has limited/restricted means of entry or exit; and is not designed for continuous human
occupancy. CCs, functional managers, and supervisors must ensure all confined spaces that fall
under their purview are properly identified, and implement a confined spaces program as
outlined in AFOSHSTD 91-25, Confined Spaces. Also see AFOSHSTD 48-137, Respiratory
Protection Program, and TO 1-1-3, Inspection and Repair of Aircraft Integral Tanks and Fuel
Cells, for specific requirements. Supervisors will ensure all personnel required to enter a
confined space are properly trained, equipped, and qualified and the training is documented prior
to entry. For assistance in establishing an effective confined space program contact the
installation ground safety office.
2.12. Munitions Safety Guidance. Use munitions safety requirements found in AFMAN 91-
201, Explosive Safety Standards; 11A-, 11P-, and 13A-series TOs (explosive and egress
handling safety); Chapter 16; and specific equipment TOs. AFMAN 91-201 contains safety
topics, such as, explosive safety program elements, explosive facility licenses, quantity distance
criteria, handling of aircraft, remotely piloted vehicles and drones containing explosives, fire
protection, storage and compatibility standards, transportation, etc. The 11, 11A-, 11K-, 11P-,
13A-, and 21M- series TOs deal with the specifics of handling and maintaining explosive items
or components. Chapter 16 of this instruction pertains to the handling of egress and escape
systems and personnel training, certification, and decertification.
2.13. Lockout and Tagout Concept. Use procedures to isolate machinery or equipment (in off-
equipment areas) from all potentially hazardous energy. Instruct all personnel in the safety
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 33


significance of lockout or tagout procedures. Find complete guidance for instituting an effective
program in AFOSHSTD 91-501.
2.14. Warning Tags. See TO 00-20-1
2.15. Danger Tags. Will only be used when an immediate hazard exists and specific
precautions are required to protect personnel or property or as required by TOs, instructions, or
other directed requirements. Tags will be placed on damaged equipment and immediate
arrangements made for the equipment to be taken out of service and sent to the repair shop. Do
not use the AF Form 979, Danger Tag, for on-equipment aircraft maintenance.
2.16. Contracted Operations.
   2.16.1. Refer to AFI 91-301, AF Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection,
   and Health (AFOSH) and AFOSH 91-100, Air Force Occupational Safety and Health
   Standard, for guidance on AFOSH applicability to contractors.
2.17. Safety “Knock It Off. ‖ Due to the inherent danger to life, limb, and property associated
with maintenance operations, personnel require a means to pause or terminate an operation or
situation which they perceive is unsafe or too dangerous. When crew leaders become task-
focused, junior personnel are often better able to assess the danger; however, deferring to the
experience and judgment of the crew leader, they may choose to remain silent, missing an
opportunity to break the mishap sequence chain. Operators have long used the call words
―Knock it Off‖ in their profession; maintenance commanders and supervisors should foster the
same culture in their units so that a simple, but recognizable ―audible‖ from anyone can prevent
a potential mishap.
2.18. Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Management System (ESOHMS) or
Environmental Management System (EMS).
   2.18.1. All personnel shall complete Environmental Management System (EMS) awareness
   training. Commanders or EMS management personnel shall complete EMS Manager training

   estimated time in commission (ETIC), job completion) and configuration status IAW AFI
   21-103 with the MOC and the production superintendent.
   4.6.16. Ensure completed aircraft forms are provided to the debrief function by the end of
   the flying day if debriefs have been suspended due to surges.
4.7. Aircrew and Maintenance Debrief Section. Debriefing is conducted at the termination of
each sortie/mission or when a sortie/mission is aborted. Aircraft scheduled for turn-around
sorties/missions need not be debriefed if returned in landing status Code 1 or 2. However,
debriefing is required, regardless of landing status, after the last flight of the day for each
aircrew. Lead Commands will develop debrief procedures for Remote Split Operations for both
aircraft and ground control stations to adequately capture all maintenance discrepancies.
   4.7.1. Use aircraft fault reporting manuals and include fault codes when documenting
   discrepancies in the aircraft forms. Use automated debrief tools such as the Computerized
   Fault Reporting System.
       4.7.1.1. Develop aircrew debriefing guides. Debriefing guides are reviewed and
       approved by QA every two years.
       4.7.1.1. (AETC) Units may implement debriefing guides developed by the respective
       weapon system lead command.
       4.7.1.2. (Added-AETC) In the event of a T-38 flameout or stall condition, document
       the condition using AETC Form 290, Aircraft Flameout/Stall Debrief Checksheet. Other

  home station and deployed sorties/missions, are updated no later than the next duty day after
  occurrence.
  4.7.4. Check AFTO FORM/IMT 781H for Airframe Time and Block 13 Servicing Data.
  4.7.5. Input discrepancy and deviation information, utilization, and applicable flight data (to
  include landing status, system capability IAW AFI 21-103 and other applicable cause code)
  into the MIS. Unless using an automated 781 process do not send AFTO 781-Series
  IMTs/forms to Flying Operations before MIS updates. Use local backup procedures for
  recording data when the MIS becomes inoperable.
  4.7.5. (AETC) Maintenance debriefing is a critical element in the data integrity process.
  Complete and accurate debriefing must be accomplished to ensure all utilization, deviation,
  pilot reported discrepancies (PRD), and repeat/recur information is captured. Use the specific
  line/mission number published in the weekly schedule when inputting debrief data into the
  MIS. When code 1 and 2 aircraft are not debriefed until the end of the day, debrief will
  ensure AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, flight data
  information is updated in the MIS.
  4.7.6. Utilize MIS to identify and research discrepancies for Repeat/Recur trends, and
  document them accordingly in the AFTO Form/IMT 781A. Ensure previously documented
  discrepancies are reviewed and identified as repeat/recurs.
     4.7.6.1. All repeat/recurs are identified on automated debriefing sortie recaps and in the
     AFTO Form/IMT 781A by automated method, stamp, pen, marker, etc.
     4.7.6.2. (Added-AETC) When a TO requires an in-flight operational check to verify a
     maintenance action, or required test equipment is not available (inoperative), a repeat will
     not be counted if the operational check fails on the next sortie. Repeats are not recorded
     until a successful in-flight operational check has been documented.
  4.7.7. Use the appropriate landing status code (Table 4.1) and the appropriate system
  capability code (Table 4.2) for the completion of a sortie/mission.
  4.7.8. Provide the MOC with aircraft identification numbers and system WUCs for each
  aircraft debriefed with a landing status Code-3 using the MESL in the Lead Command Supp
  to AFI 21-103.
  4.7.9. Enter one of the deviation cause codes (Table 4.3) into the MIS to indicate the reason
  for the deviation and the agency that caused a deviation (AFCSM 21-574, Automated
  Debriefing).
  4.7.9. (AETC) Deviation cause code ―Xxx‖ (Table 4.3 of the basic publication) will not be
  used without prior approval from Maintenance Management Branch (HQ AETC/A4MM).
  4.7.10. Capture ASIP information for the Aircraft Structural Integrity Management
  Information System (ASIMIS) IAW AFI 63-1001, Aircraft Structural Integrity Program as
  directed by the Program Manager
  4.7.11. If MIS is not available, use blank printouts as manual documentation method. If
  deployed, send documents to home station for data transcribing by the most expeditious
  means available. Turn in, validate and reconcile all documents with the MIS when it becomes
  available

     4.7.12.1. Responsibilities:
        4.7.12.1.1. Launch and Recovery Element (LRE) debriefer - The LRE debriefer will
        use a standardized debrief checklist to debrief the LRE aircrew. The LRE debriefer
        will monitor the SIPRNET Skynet database maintenance log for aircraft debrief
        information. The LRE debriefer will also review the SIPRNET Skynet database
        maintenance log when notified by the Mission Control Element (MCE) debriefer and
        during the debrief after the final aircraft handback to the LRE. During SIPRNET
        communication outages, the CONUS and OCONUS debrief sections will use IMDS
        screen 837 Log Book to communicate aircraft discrepancies.
        4.7.12.1.2. LRE Pilot In Command (PIC) - Review applicable aircraft and
        Launch/Recovery Ground Control Station (LRGCS) AFTO Form 781 series forms
        prior to launch and relay pertinent configuration data to the MCE PIC. The LRE PIC
        may request the LRE debriefer and a system specialist to enter the GCS for on-the-
        spot debriefing and fault isolation. Perform face-to-face debrief with LRE debriefer
        at the completion of every handover and landing.
        4.7.12.1.3. MCE PIC - Review applicable aircraft AFTO Form 781As and Ground
        Control Station (GCS) AFTO Form 781 series forms prior to handover from LRE.
        MCE PIC may request the MCE debriefer and a system specialist to enter the GCS
        for on-the-spot debriefing and fault isolation. MCE PIC will annotate all aircraft
        discrepancies in Skynet database maintenance log in SIPRNET under the description
        block. Discrepancies will need to be as descriptive as possible and should be entered
        at the time they occur. MCE PIC will hand-carry GCS AFTO Form 781 series forms
        binder to MCE debrief and perform face-to-face debrief with MCE debriefer
        immediately after aircrew changeover, Ku-to-Ku handover, or final aircraft handback
        to LRE. MCE PIC will document GCS discrepancies on GCS AFTO Form 781A.
        MCE PIC will be available during debrief to answer question(s) from the LRE
        debriefer or deployed technicians.
        4.7.12.1.4. MCE debriefer - Print applicable aircraft AFTO Form 781A and 781K
        forms and place in front of AFTO Form 781F in GCS forms binder prior to MCE PIC
        receiving GCS AFTO Form 781 series forms. Review GCS AFTO Form 781 series
        after aircrew changeover, Ku-to-Ku handover, or final aircraft handback to LRE.
        Enter GCS discrepancies into IMDS and notify affected work center. MCE debriefer
        will not enter aircraft discrepancies in IMDS since this is an LRE debrief
        responsibility. Instead, the MCE debriefer will verify that aircraft discrepancies are
        accurately entered in the Skynet database maintenance log by reviewing maintenance
        log entries with the MCE PIC and/or sensor operator. MCE debrief will fill out a
        standardized debrief checklist for each in-flight discrepancy and forward checklists to
        the LRE debriefer. If additional maintenance log entries are required the MCE
        debriefer will make them at this time. The MCE debriefer will then notify the LRE
        debrief section via phone or e-mail to review Skynet database maintenance log and
        ensure checklists for each in-flight discrepancy were received. If no Skynet database
        maintenance log entries have been made by the aircrew during flight or at final
        debrief, the MCE debriefer will make a Skynet database maintenance log entry to
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                61


          include ZULU date/time, aircraft tail number, ID number of GCS used to control the
          aircraft and narrative stating ―No defects Noted during flight segment.‖ The MCE
          debriefer will then notify the LRE debrief section via phone to review Skynet
          database maintenance log. The MCE debriefer will keep a log of all contacts made
          with the LRE debrief section after every debrief. Log entries will include as a
          minimum ZULU date/time of phone call, rank/name of person contacted, and whether
          they acknowledged the aircraft discrepancy. If contact is made by e-mail, the e-mail
          address of the person contacted will be entered. During SIPRNET communication
          outage conditions, the CONUS and OCONUS debrief sections will use IMDS screen
          837 Log Book to communicate aircraft discrepancies. As a minimum the following
          information will be included: ZULU debrief date/time, aircraft tail number, ID
          number of GCS used to control the aircraft, code of discrepancy, description of
          discrepancy, first name initial and last name of MCE debriefer, and first name initial
          and last name of MCE PIC or sensor operator who provided the aircraft debrief
          information. MCE debriefer will return GCS AFTO Form 781 series forms binder
          with aircraft AFTO Form 781A including newly debriefed aircraft discrepancies to
          the respective GCS after aircrew changeover or Ku-to-Ku handover debrief.

          applicable aircraft and MAC GCS station face-to-face debrief with MCE debriefer
          after aircrew changeover, Ku-to-Ku handover, or final aircraft handback to LRE.
          This is necessary as MAC GCS PIC is normally in control of more than one aircraft
          and remains in MAC GCS until relieved.
          4.7.12.1.6. Predator Operations Center Production Superintendent will review 20%
          of aircraft debriefs at least once daily to compare the debriefs with the discrepancy
          entered in IMDS and verify CONUS debrief information is being entered in
          OCONUS IMDS debriefs. Variations between OCONUS IMDS debrief entries and
          CONUS debrief information will be resolved by the respective Production
          Superintendents.

frequency (UHF) radio transmission according to local procedures. (Note: Undergraduate pilot
training (UPT) or specialized undergraduate pilot training (SUPT) units need not relay code 1
and 2 status to maintenance prior to arrival.) In case of a ground abort, the aircrew will document
an AFTO Form 781A discrepancy concerning the abort and move to the spare aircraft, if
available. Maintenance debrief personnel will debrief the aborted aircrew/aircraft. If a spare
aircraft is not available, the aircrew will debrief the aircraft with the debrief personnel. When
debriefing an aircrew after the last flight of the day, ensure all previous sorties and missions not
debriefed earlier due to a landing status code of 1 or 2 are included in the ―last flight of the day‖
debrief. All sorties regardless of landing status will be entered in the MIS.

5.7. Armament Flight.
   5.7.1. The armament flight normally performs off-equipment maintenance for assigned
   fighter aircraft armament systems, guns, pylons, racks, launchers and adapters. For B-52/AC-
   130 gunship units, the armament flight shall perform weapons system on-equipment periodic
   phase inspections. An AFSC 2S0X1 Materiel Management journeyman/craftsman may be
   assigned to the flight if mission dictates and respective 2S Functional Manager concurs. The
   flight normally consists of three sections: maintenance, AME, and support. The WWM, with
   MXG/CC concurrence, determines when armament systems personnel are required to
   perform load crew duties or related certifiable tasks. MAJCOM must determine applicable
   portions of the weapons and armament responsibilities for contract and civil service
   organizations. ANG: The above responsibilities are performed by the weapons section. Note:
   Armament flights are not normally formed in MQ-1 Predator units.
   5.7.1. (AETC) The armament function at Tyndall AFB is contracted; their armament
   responsibilities are contained exclusively in paragraph 4.10.6 (Added) of this supplement.
   Note: Only military units are bound to the organizational requirements of AFI 21-101 and
   this supplement. Contract units will organize according to their respective contract.
   5.7.2. When more than one AMU is supported, combat armament support teams (CAST)
   may be formed. If the maintenance section is organized into CASTs, each will be aligned
   with a specific AMU. CASTs provide exclusive support (to the maximum extent possible) to
   the AMU with which they are aligned. If applicable, show CAST alignment on UMDs and
   establish separate MIS work centers for each. Divide tools and equipment proportionally and
   jointly use scarce or one-of-a-kind items; do not exceed Allowance Standards (AS)
   quantities. Equally divide maintenance responsibilities for joint-use equipment between
   CASTs. As a minimum, CAST chiefs will be 7-skill level NCOs and are responsible to the
   maintenance section NCOIC for all maintenance actions performed by their respective team
   (flight chief may waive CAST chief requirements). The CAST maintenance concept is not
   intended to prohibit a unified or consolidated armament flight effort to meet the overall
   production goals.

      commission. Calculate rates by the type of equipment in their functional configuration;
      for example, a pylon with a bomb rack installed and a missile launcher with a remote
      interface unit installed are considered one item for measuring purposes. Equipment is
      considered in commission if there are no discrepancies or parts required (to include
      TCTOs) that would hinder performance of the intended function. Note: Equipment is not
      considered out of commission just because it is undergoing scheduled, preventative, or
      minor maintenance.
      5.7.4.15. (Added-AETC) Develop plans and schedules separately for each operations
      squadron or other customers supported. Note: Plans and schedules may be developed on

       5.7.6.10. Manage residual and bench stock.
       5.7.6.11. Manage HAZMAT and ESOH items IAW ESOH guidance.
       5.7.6.12. Refer to Chapter 11 of this instruction for maintenance supply support.
5.8. Avionics Flight
   5.8.1. Managers prioritize work to meet current and projected mission needs. MICAP parts
   receive priority repair (P1), Readiness Spares package (RSP) requirements are considered
   next and are prioritized by their demand rates and stock levels (P2). Peacetime operating
   stock restock items are normally worked as priority three (P3) , prioritized by the demand
   rates and item stock levels. All other items will be considered priority four (P4).
   5.8.2. Two-Level Maintenance (2LM). 2LM restricts the level of repair authorized for
   avionics line replaceable units (LRUs). The following guidelines apply to organizations
   operating under 2LM. Refer to AFI 21-129 for further guidance.
       5.8.2.1. Avionics sections are authorized to perform the following maintenance actions if
       the required support equipment is authorized and on-hand. Repairs above and beyond
       those listed require approval from the appropriate approval authority (e.g., Lead
       Command, depot). 2LM flights will limit repairs to:
          5.8.2.1.1. CND or bench check serviceable (BCS) screening.
          5.8.2.1.2. TCTOs performed at wing level.
          5.8.2.1.3. LRU operational flight program (OFP) loads.
          5.8.2.1.4. Shop-replaceable units (SRU) cross-CANNs.
          5.8.2.1.5. Replacement of minor bits and pieces.
          5.8.2.1.6. High priority TCTOs or other circumstances may result in more workload
          than can be accommodated under 2LM. In the event the section cannot accomplish
          the special workload as well as normal CND/BCS screening, the following formula
          may be used to identify those 2LM LRUs that could be temporarily ―direct Not
          Repairable This Station (NRTS)‖ without screening. The formula may also help
          determine LRU priorities in order to adjust workload to meet production. Index
          formula: Index Number = Percent of Base Repair (PBR) * EXCHG PRICE * Daily
          Demand Rate (DDR).
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                105


              5.8.2.1.6.1. LRUs with higher index numbers have a higher priority for repair
              compared to those with lower numbers. In the example below, the PSP would
              have the highest priority, followed by DMT. DFLCC may be a candidate to
              temporarily ―Direct NRTS‖ until workload permits CND/BCS screening.

                       MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS SQUADRON

6.1. General. The MOS is directly responsible to the MXG/CC for the administration, analysis,
training management, and programs and resources necessary to support the group production
effort. The MOS is comprised of the following flights, Maintenance Operations, Maintenance
Training, and Programs and Resources. The planning, controlling, scheduling, and executing
responsibilities of the MXG/CC will be met through the actions of these functions.
6.2. Maintenance Operations Flight (MOF). The flight is comprised of the following
sections: Maintenance Operations Center; Engine Management; Maintenance Data Systems
Analysis; Plans, Scheduling and Documentation; and Maintenance Supply Liaison (assigned to
LRS but may physically reside in Maintenance). This flight is the central agency for monitoring
and developing long-range strategies to sustain the health of the fleet. Fleet management is
defined as the effective utilization of available resources to accomplish the aircraft support cycle
from planned maintenance events to flying schedule execution. It is a disciplined and prioritized
scheduling effort that optimizes support to aircraft requirements such as flying events, ground
training events, scheduled maintenance inspections, aircraft configuration control, aircraft
modification schedules and aircraft recovery maintenance. Effective fleet management results in
consistent availability of quality aircraft to meet operational requirements. The MOF
superintendent position will be filled by senior NCO 2RXXX personnel, if available. (N/A to the
ARC.)
   6.2.1. MOF/CC/Chief (MOF/SUPT). In addition to general responsibilities in chapter 3 will:

      6.2.6.16.6. Data Integrity Teams (DIT). All units will establish a DIT. The purposes
      of the DIT include: (1) ensuring the unit has complete and accurate data in the MIS
      and aircraft forms, (2) identifying and quantifying problems within the unit
      preventing complete and accurate documentation, and, (3) identifying and correcting
      the root causes for poor data integrity. The DIT is established to
      evaluate/isolate/eliminate documentation problems in IMDS-CDB/G081. MMA is the
      OPR for the team, but is not responsible for correcting errors. The DIT will include at
      least one representative from each squadron that repairs aircraft. It will include
      participation from PS&D, MOC, MSL/LRS, EM, debrief, and QA on an as needed
      basis, as determined by analysis. Lead Command will determine the frequency of DIT
      meetings. Representatives will be at least 5-levels and familiar with the unit’s
      assigned weapon system(s). As a minimum, the following weekly functions will be
      performed by the DIT:
         6.2.6.16.6.1. Ensure MIS accurately reflects AFTO Form/IMT 781 entries. A
         minimum of one aircraft per flying squadron, per week will be checked. Rotate
         selected tail numbers to ensure of all aircraft’s forms are reviewed at least once
         each year. For the selected aircraft, 100% of the previous weeks IMT-AFTO form
         781As will be reviewed against MIS. When the two differ, the responsible work
         center will be charged with an error and have it included in the error rate. Records
         checks do not cover this requirement.
         6.2.6.16.6.2. Compare all NRTS actions and turnarounds in IMDS-CDB/G081
         with those in the ILS-S to ensure they match. G081 users will request these
         reports from LRS. Work with supply to resolve conflicts.
         6.2.6.16.6.3. Run maintenance action review background reports for all work
         accomplished by squadron and work center.
             6.2.6.16.6.3.1. Audit the report by JCN/WCE to verify the corrective action
             narratives match the action taken codes used and the WUC utilized most
             accurately identifies the affected system.
             6.2.6.16.6.3.2. Identify suspected errors on the report by circling or marking
             on the report and give report to appropriate squadron for corrections. Identify
             and count the documentation errors. Use of automated processes is authorized.
         6.2.6.16.6.4. Develop a system to track the number of errors by work center and
         squadron.
         6.2.6.16.6.5. Establish a 5 day suspense to correct errors and report back to the
         DIT.

management section and the development and instructor section. The MTF assists SQ/CCs by
providing Unit Training Managers (UTM) to manage the enlisted specialty training program.
The MTF Chief maintains administrative responsibility for UTMs whether UTMs are centralized
or decentralized.
   6.3.1. Organizations that do not have a MTF must complete skill training in the individual
   work centers.
   6.3.2. Maintenance training is an essential element of improving and sustaining unit
   capability; it must receive priority treatment by SQ/CC and MOO/MX SUPT. When
   balancing resources (e.g., aircraft, support equipment, facilities, tools, funding, personnel),
   maintenance training carries an equal priority with the operational training mission.
   Accomplish maintenance training away from the production/test environment (whenever
   possible) to eliminate/minimize distractions.

   Training Centers (RTC), Maintenance Qualification Centers (MQC), Advanced Distributed
   Learning Service (ADLS), the Environmental, Safety, and Health Training Network
   (ESOHTN),or any combination thereof.
      6.3.3.1. AETC TDs will be utilized as the primary maintenance training resource at all
      bases with an assigned TD. The TD will not be responsible to conduct ancillary training.
      The MTF will develop courses and supplement training when the training requirements
      are beyond the capability and timely response of the TD. The MTF will not duplicate
      training provided by the TD.
   6.3.4. For maintenance training policy and guidance, refer to AFI 36-2232 and Lead
   Command directives. Civil service and contract organizations shall perform training IAW
   their training plans as accepted by the government, their respective performance work
   statement (PWS) and Lead Command directives.

      MAINTENANCE PLANS, SCHEDULING AND DOCUMENTATION (PS&D)

7.1. General. Maintenance documentation maintains historical documents and maintenance
data essential for the development of wing plans and schedules and is an integral part of all
PS&D functions. PS&D sections maintain historical maintenance data within the MIS. The
accuracy of maintenance document entries is a basic responsibility of the initiator and
supervisors. PS&D sections develop wing maintenance plans using MIS aircraft historical data
input by all maintenance personnel. Maintenance schedulers are centralized (physically) in the
MOF PS&D section. Exception: Engine Management, Nuclear Munitions, AFSOC units will be
centrally managed with decentralized execution. Units publish written guidance in an
OI/supplement to ensure standardized core scheduling practices across the wing to include:
   7.1.1. Automated and AFTO IMT 95 documentation requirements.
   7.1.2. Standardized aircraft jacket files. Develop and maintain a standardized master aircraft
   jacket file for use throughout the wing. Wing assigned aircraft jacket files must mirror the
   standard in organization and appearance. Slight variations in composition are allowed
   between different MDSs.
   7.1.3. Missing IMTs policy requirements and annual jacket file review checklists.
   7.1.4. Pre-dock and post-dock inspection meeting guidance to supplement this chapter and
   identify minimum required attendees. PS&D will attend meetings and notify the appropriate
   SQ/CC and flight supervisors of any recurring problems.
   7.1.5. Inspection requirements for historical documents at all decentralized scheduling
   activities IAW this chapter and Lead Command guidance.
   7.1.6. Management of the wing’s SI, TCI, TCTO and Aircraft Configuration Management
   (ACM) programs IAW this chapter and Lead Command guidance. Assign specific
   responsibilities for each work center involved (e.g., egress, aircrew AFE, and PS&D) and
   establish procedures to ensure configuration data is maintained during routine maintenance
   actions. TCI and TCTO procedures must outline the requirements for ordering hazardous
   materials (e.g., batteries). Units using MIS will not delegate suspense validation processing
   for TCIs installed on aircraft to the performing work center unless the written procedures
   include: a list of work centers and specific technicians authorized to process suspenses, a list
   of the specific suspenses authorized to be cleared and the method for notifying PS&D of the
   work completed (an audit trail). EM will process all MIS suspense validations for engines
   and engine components.
   7.1.7. Common formats for TCTO folders and monthly/weekly utilization and maintenance
   schedules across the wing. Folders and schedules will be standardized among the same MDS,
   but may vary slightly between MDSs.
   7.1.8. Freezing and consolidating aircraft and equipment records in the event of an accident,
   mishap or impoundment.
   7.1.9. Aircraft and equipment transfer inspections IAW this chapter.

   7.1.10. Accomplishment of an Aircraft Documents Review (ADR) checklist for home
   station and deployed units. This checklist will identify who initiates the ADR, reviewing
   agencies (to include the OAP lab), AFTO Form/IMT 781 entry requirements, agency
   responsible for completing the AFTO Form/IMT 781/MIS entry, and outline any
   configuration verification requirements.
       7.1.10.1. Maintenance personnel will correct all documentation discrepancies discovered
       during the ADR, prior to updating the ADR JCN.
   7.1.11. Verifying configuration items during aircraft phases.
   7.1.12. Procedures to update manual products in the event Maintenance Scheduling
   Application Tool (MSAT) and/or the MIS are not available for an extended period of time
   (more than 48 hours). Paper MIS products are not required when using MSAT (IMDS users
   only) or the most current AF standardized Aircraft Maintenance Scheduling Mission Support
   Application to facilitate the management of MIS data. The back-up plan will ensure access to
   the most current paper or electronic version of MIS products used in MSAT. The MSAT
   administrator will be assigned to PS&D.
7.1. (AETC) General. Comply with the requirements in AETCI 21-104, AFI 21-101, and this
supplement. MSAT or future Air Force standardized aircraft maintenance scheduling mission
support application tools may be used to facilitate the management of MIS data for TCI,
scheduled and special inspection (SI), TCTO, and flying hour programs. ALIS Prognostics and
Health Management System is used to manage and monitor life expectancy and cycles for the F-
35 aircraft to include deferred discrepancy management within ALIS.
7.2. Manage the following programs for assigned aircraft and equipment using the
following guidelines:
   7.2.1. Aircraft Document Reviews. ADRs validate and correct any errors on airframe and
   engine operating times and cycles, TCTO documentation, TCI component operating times,
   time remaining to the next inspection, backordered supply document numbers and open and
   deferred discrepancies. Aircraft AFTO Form/IMT 781-series for possessed aircraft, are
   reviewed by flightline maintenance functions (DCC or alternate), PS&D, EM and supply to
   ensure the accuracy and validity of entries.
       7.2.1.1. The MIS background product ―Automated Records Check (ARC)‖ or on-line
       MIS products may be used to perform the ADR, however, ensure use of MIS products is
       standardized for all assigned units. Units using MDS specific MIS systems (i.e. IMIS)
       must develop procedures to ensure implement the intent of Aircraft Document Review.
       7.2.1.2. An ADR is accomplished at least every 60 days for units using fully automated
       AFTO 781-series (AFTO FORMs 781A, 781J, 781K, and 95 generated by the MIS will
       constitute fully automated series). Units without access to a MIS and authorized to use
       manual AFTO 781-series IMTs, must accomplish an ADR at least every 30 days. Also
       accomplish an ADR when an aircraft is transferred (including Queen Bee), deployed for
       more than 30 days, before and after scheduled inspections (PH or ISO), before and after
       storage and after fatigue tests. For CANN aircraft, conduct ADRs at least every 30 days.
       7.2.1.2. (AETC) Accomplish an ADR before and after a scheduled PE and HPO and
       upon removal from CANN status. EXCEPTION: ADRs are not required before and after
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                161


     an HPO on the ―T‖ designated aircraft that fall under the phase concept and the HPO on
     the H-1 helicopter unless the ADRs are on the normal cycle.
     7.2.1.3. ADR Procedures:
         7.2.1.3.1. PS&D creates a JST for ADRs and ensures it is loaded against all assigned
         aircraft.
         7.2.1.3.2. Schedule the ADR in maintenance plans. An ADR is a scheduled
         maintenance action and counts in MSE computations.
         7.2.1.3.3. PS&D and EM validate applicable inspection, TCI, TCTO data for correct
         due dates or expiration dates, airframe and engine operating times (or flight times if
         applicable) and appropriate symbol entry IAW TO 00-20-1.
         7.2.1.3.3. (AETC) The maintenance technician will clear the ADR JCN in the
         AFTO Form 781A and in MIS. PS&D will ensure the next due date is correct before
         clearing the suspense.
         7.2.1.3.4. AMU/AMXS supply runs a tail number inquiry to validate backorders and
         corrects any discrepancies discovered.
         7.2.1.3.4. (AETC) In units where the supply function has been contracted and/or
         isn’t available within the maintenance unit, the supporting supply function is required
         to provide the necessary supply information.
  7.2.2. Pre-Dock Meetings. PS&D will review planned aircraft inspection schedules and
  initiate an AF IMT 2410, Inspection/TCTO Planning Checklist, or locally developed AF
  2410 for each aircraft prior to the pre-inspection meeting. Lead Commands may determine if
  the pre-/post dock requirement for inspections with less than a 200 hourly cycle is required.
  If it is determined that a pre and post dock meeting is not required, an AF IMT 2410 is also
  not required. PS&D personnel will:
  7.2.2. (AETC) Pre-Dock Meetings. Units will determine locally if pre- and post-dock
  meetings are required according to guidance provided in AFI 21-101, paragraph 7.2.2. If pre-
  and post-dock meetings are required, PS&D will conduct the meetings with the inspection
  section NCOIC and crew chief (flight line representative) to review inspection packages and
  ensure they are accomplished appropriately. Paragraphs 7.2.2.3 (Added) through 7.2.2.4
  (Added) provide additional responsibilities of PS&D.
     7.2.2.1. Prior to the pre-dock meeting
         7.2.2.1.1. Review and list all known aircraft and equipment TCTO, TCI, SI and other
         major requirements to be accomplished during the inspection on the AF IMT 2410, or
         locally developed product
         7.2.2.1.2. Identify requirements for kits or parts
         7.2.2.1.3. List all DDs to be accomplished during the inspection on the AF IMT 2410
         keeping the original JCNs.
         7.2.2.1.4. Incorporate all requirements against the aircraft into a work package.
         7.2.2.1.5. List the agencies required to attend the meeting and any discussion items to
         be presented in Block 14.
162                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


         7.2.2.1.6. List specialist tasks required in addition to normal inspection needs in
         Block 15.
         7.2.2.1.7. Develop a list of items identified as out-of-configuration for
         verification/correction during the inspection. PS&D will request IMDS DBM process
         screen 942, Actual Configuration Set-up, using the ID number of the aircraft. Once
         accomplished, PS&D must run an IMDS screen 990. For G081 users, view screen
         8110. For non-configuration tracked aircraft, compile a list of missing serially
         controlled items and coordinate/forward them to dock chief for verification.
      7.2.2.2. At the pre-dock meeting, inform representatives of the inspection schedule and
      scope, including TCTOs, TCIs, SIs, DDs and special requirements to be accomplished.
      Agency representatives inform PS&D of limiting factors that might affect the schedule.
      Discuss aircraft configuration during all aircraft pre-dock meetings. Provide a copy of the
      IMDS screen 990 or G081 screen 8110 to the Dock NCOIC in the pre-dock package for
      verification/correction. The responsible work center will correct verified erroneous data
      and out-of-configuration items in IMDS prior to the post-dock meeting. Use the AF IMT
      2410, or locally developed AF IMT 2410 to record additional information discussed
      during the pre-dock meeting. Maintain the original AF IMT 2410, or locally developed
      AF IMT 2410 on file in the aircraft jacket file for use as a guide when conducting the
      post-dock meeting. Give a copy to the dock NCOIC or equivalent.
      7.2.2.3. (Added-AETC) Prior to the pre-dock meeting, accomplish an aircraft document
      review. Schedule the pre-dock meeting so the aircraft AFTO 781 series forms are
      available for review during the meeting, and conduct the meeting before starting the
      inspection. As a minimum, representatives from PS&D, inspection, flight line functions,
      egress function (when CAD and PAD TCIs or TCI verifications are scheduled) and
      supply (if needed to validate part availability) will attend the pre-dock meeting.
      7.2.2.4. (Added-AETC) after the meeting, schedule all actions listed on the original AF
      Form 2410 in the MIS.
  7.2.3. Post-Dock Meetings. PS&D will hold a post-dock for all inspections that required a
  pre-dock meeting. At the meeting, the Dock NCOIC, PS&D, DCC or alternate and other
  attendees discuss open discrepancies, review any significant inspection events and identify
  any problems that may adversely affect future scheduling. PS&D will request the DBM to
  process screen 942 or a new screen 990 for the same aircraft and bring that product to the
  post dock to review/ verify corrections with annotated IMDS 990 given to the Dock NCOIC
  at the pre-dock.(screen 8110 for G081 users). The Dock NCOIC gives the completed
  inspection work package to PS&D for filing until it is replaced by the next similar inspection
  work package. (For example, an HPO1 will be replaced by the next HPO1 and the HPO2 will
  be replaced with the next HPO2, etc…, and the completed/verified copies of the output
  product (screen 942 or 990) must be maintained in PS&D until the next scheduled PH/ISO
  inspection for that aircraft. PS&D files a computer-printed listing of completed on-line work
  orders in the aircraft jacket file.
  7.2.3. (AETC) Post-Dock Meetings. PS&D will chair the post-dock meeting. Attendees will
  include PS&D, the inspection section NCOIC, the crew chief (flight line representative) and
  any other functional area needed to ensure a productive meeting. The post-dock will be held
  as soon as possible after completion of the inspection and prior to normal flight. Newly
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               163


  printed or transcribed AFTO 781 series forms will be used to accomplish the post-dock. Prior
  to the post-dock, the inspection function manager will:
     7.2.3.1. (Added-AETC) Ensure all discrepancies discovered during the look phase of
     the inspection have been entered into the MIS according to TO 00-20-1.
     7.2.3.2. (Added-AETC) Review the MIS to ensure corrected discrepancies and
     inspection card items are properly documented.
     7.2.3.3. (Added-AETC) Ensure scheduled actions listed on AF Form 2410 are properly
     documented.
     7.2.3.4. (Added-AETC) Change the delivery destination for parts ordered but not yet
     received during the inspection.
     7.2.3.5. (Added-AETC) At the post-dock, PS&D will:
         7.2.3.5.1. (Added-AETC) Review the work package for completeness and perform
         a document review (DR). Attendees must be prepared to discuss any significant
         factors that had an effect on the inspection and could adversely impact future plans,
         including items on AF Form 2410 not completed.
         7.2.3.5.2. (Added-AETC) In coordination with the EM section, review or process
         all suspense’s and verify TCTO status, TCIs, and inspection due dates for accuracy.
         Correct errors immediately and update historical records as required.
         7.2.3.5.3. (Added-AETC) After a complete validation of all records, make the final
         entries on AF Form 2410 and file the original and all products in the aircraft jacket
         file with the inspection work package.
  7.2.4. Aircraft Configuration Management. ACM provides unit managers the capability to
  determine the actual versus approved configuration of an aircraft. The intent of configuration
  management is to ensure selected serially controlled and/or TCIs are properly loaded to the
  MIS database. Of major concern are accurate, approved part numbers, quantity per assembly
  (QPA) and next higher assembly (NHA) items by WUC/LCN. PS&D has overall
  responsibility for the ACM subsystem of the MIS and will provide assistance to maintenance
  personnel. The performing work center supervisor and PS&D must conduct supervisory
  reviews of configuration change, TCTO, SI and TCI events using MIS on-line capabilities.
  Individual work centers accomplishing TCIs are responsible for changing configuration
  information in MIS. Unless otherwise specified in local procedures, schedulers must process
  IMDS screen 128 for all removal, installation, TCI, SI and TCTO compliance updates for
  any items installed on the aircraft. EM must process IMDS screen 128 for engines and engine
  components
     7.2.4.1. The configuration tables (F-15s, F-16s, F-22As, CV22B, B-1s and B-2s) are
     electronically pushed to each unit from REMIS as aircraft configuration changes occur.
     Items not accessed or visible during routine field-level maintenance should be identified
     to Lead Command and ALC managers for removal from the configuration management
     table.
     7.2.4.2. Maintenance personnel discovering an item with a missing data plate, or one
     which does not have a serial number, will contact the Lead Command system functional
     manager and ALC item manager for disposition.
164                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


      7.2.4.3. For those aircraft that do not currently have an established configuration table,
      use IMDS screen 810 to validate the installed items against the data in the MIS.
      7.2.4.4. PS&D will coordinate the daily resolution of configuration management notices
      utilizing screen 690 or applicable MIS screen. Discrepancies must be briefed at the daily
      production/scheduling meeting and forwarded to the appropriate maintenance section for
      corrective action.
      7.2.4.4. (AETC) Accomplish configuration verification during PE/PH/ISO inspections
      on those installed part number and serial number items identified in the aircraft specific
      dash-6 TO that are accessible or visible during inspection. Do not remove components or
      open panels for the sole purpose of verifying part/serial number data during PE/PH/ISO
      inspections.
      7.2.4.5. When out of configuration items or missing serially tracked items are
      discovered, establish a single DD for out-of-configuration condition. Add an IMDS WCE
      for each WUC/LCN and part/serial number item requiring verification to that single DD.
  7.2.5. Major Maintenance Work Processing. PS&D will:
      7.2.5.1. Coordinate on all TO 00-25-107 requests for AFI 21-103 reporting. The work
      center discovering the discrepancy is responsible for drafting the TO 00-25-107 request
      and forwarding the request to QA for coordination and release. PS&D is responsible for
      making the appropriate possession code changes in MIS when AFI 21-103 messages have
      been released. Depot level assistance provided by contractor support is accomplished
      IAW contract specifications.
      7.2.5.2. In conjunction with QA, develop procedures for routing all major maintenance
      requests to ensure all affected parties are informed.
      7.2.5.3. Upon arrival of the DFT, PS&D will conduct an initial meeting to validate
      maintenance support requirements are in place. Meetings will be documented on an AF
      IMT 2410, or locally developed product.
      7.2.5.4. Once work is completed, PS&D will ensure appropriate possession codes are
      changed and a completed copy of the work package is placed in the aircraft historical file.
      Document significant historical data on the appropriate AFTO IMT 95 IAW 00-20 series
      TOs.
  7.2.6. TCTO Management. PS&D administers and manages the overall wing TCTO
  program. TCTOs and AF, Lead Command or NAF-directed modifications and inspections
  provide units with instructions for doing a one-time change, modification, or inspection of
  equipment, (includes applicable FAA air worthiness directives, original equipment
  manufacturer service bulletins and service instructions, after concurrence by Lead
  Command). Use the MIS to process Lead Command and NAF OTIs or modifications in the
  same manner as TCTOs with compliance periods, remove from service dates and rescission
  dates IAW TO 00-5-15. Lead Command, NAF and local inspections are referred to as OTIs.
  TCTOs, with the exception of immediate and urgent action, are considered scheduled
  maintenance and integrated into maintenance planning cycles. Consider concurrent
  accomplishment of TCTO work with other scheduled or unscheduled maintenance (e.g., PH,
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                              165


  ISO, HSC, HPO). Manage TCTOs using the MIS, TO 00-5-15 and specific Lead Command
  instructions.
     7.2.6.1. General Management of TCTOs. PS&D manages aircraft, AGE and commodity
     TCTOs. Munitions scheduling manages munitions-related TCTOs, and EM manages
     engine-related TCTOs. Armament and PMEL TCTOs will be managed by the owning
     agency however; PS&D still has the overall responsibility to monitor the effective
     management of the entire wing TCTO program. The parent technical training center
     manages and schedules all TCTOs for training equipment assigned to a TD or MTT.
        7.2.6.1.1. PS&D reviews MIS products weekly to ensure proper documentation and
        management by owning and managing TCTO agencies. When errors are detected,
        PS&D advises affected workcenters and provide assistance when necessary to correct
        the discrepancies. PS&D coordinates with MMA to ensure the MIS TCTO
        synchronization program is run at least monthly.
        7.2.6.1.2. Significant problems or potential delays in TCTO accomplishment will be
        brought to the immediate attention of the SQ/CC and MXG/CC. PS&D will brief the
        MXG/CC weekly on unaccomplished TCTOs that are within 60 days of grounding.
        7.2.6.1.3. PS&D will chair a TCTO review meeting attended by all TCTO owning
        and managing agencies after the monthly supply TCTO reconciliation meeting. These
        meetings may be combined. PS&D will discuss the supply reconciliation, supply
        status, scheduling factors, current TCTO status and anticipated problems for all active
        TCTOs. PS&D will produce minutes from the meeting and distribute to all affected
        agencies.
        7.2.6.1.4. Depot-level TCTOs, excluding commodities, are loaded and tracked in the
        MIS for auditing compliance and applicability. Depot-level engine TCTOs are loaded
        in CEMS only. Units shall ensure dual reporting of completed depot TCTOs is
        prevented. All field-level companion TCTOs for commodities must be loaded in the
        MIS.
        7.2.6.1.5. The reprogramming of passive/active ECM equipment is administered as a
        commodity TCTO for configuration management purposes. PS&D will coordinate
        with the operations electronic combat pilot/EWO before implementing any CPIN
        changes.
        7.2.6.1.6. When TCTOs are directed for items without serial numbers, assign
        permanent serial numbers IAW TO 00-20-2. If it is not feasible or impractical to
        assign a serial number (e.g., air chucks and pilot clipboards), use bulk quantity
        numbers. For example, if there are 50 air chucks, use serial numbers 1 through 50 in
        the MIS.
        7.2.6.1.7. Control and Transfer of TCTO Kits. Transfer aircraft or equipment, with
        any TCTOs still pending completion, with their applicable TCTO kits. Retain engine
        TCTO kits for engines installed on aircraft at depot locations if the aircraft is
        returning to that unit for TCTO compliance. Transfer TCTO kits IAW AFMAN 23-
        110, TO 00-5-15 and TO 00-5-1.

             and performing work centers and FSC/LRS. Minutes of this meeting will be
             recorded on AF IMT 2410 (or locally-developed product) and provide an overall
             plan to implement the TCTO. Minutes will include TCTO applicability by ID
             number (or applicable part number or serial number for commodity TCTOs),
             purpose of the inspection or modification, performing work centers, serial number
             or ID number of equipment, training requirements, scheduling parameters,
             remove from service date, a review of the TCTO procedures, IMT entries and any
             supply requirements identified before the TCTO can be scheduled for
             accomplishment. All attendees sign the AF IMT 2410, or locally developed
             product at the conclusion of the planning meeting indicating agreement with the
             conditions.
             7.2.6.2.2.3. Establish and maintain a TCTO folder for each active TCTO. The
             folder will include the basic TCTO and any supplements, completed AF IMT

             Requirements (if required), messages and the supply cover memorandum from
             QA. Once the TCTO has reached its rescission date, print a MIS product showing
             the current status of equipment and place it in the TCTO folder. Move the folder
             to an inactive TCTO file. The TCTO managing agency will maintain the folder
             until the TCTO is rescinded in the applicable TO index, MIS TCTO records will
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                            167


          be deleted at that time. TCTOs will not be deleted from the MIS prior to the
          rescission date.
          7.2.6.2.2.3. (AETC) Contractor operated and maintained base supply (COMBS)
          contracts do not require compliance with AFI 21-101; therefore, they are not
          required to complete the AF IMT 2001, Notification of TCTO Kit Requirements.
          7.2.6.2.2.4. If an initial TCTO load is not received from REMIS, notify the ALC
          to attempt a second REMIS push. If a second attempt is not successful, load the
          TCTO into the MIS. Lead Command will load TCTOs for G081 users.
          7.2.6.2.2.5. Use the ILS-S to order required kits/parts/tools IAW MIS manuals.
          When ILS-S is not available, initiate three copies of the AF IMT 2001. Forward
          two copies of the IMT with a copy of the TCTO to the supply TCTO monitor. For
          locally obtained parts, prepare an AF IMT 2001 listing each item by NSN, noun
          and quantity required. Assign ID numbers to kits as they are received. Use Part II
          of the AF IMT 2001 to manage kit/part assignment and track individual end
          items, date issued, document numbers and the number of kits remaining. The
          supply TCTO monitor will ensure kits and/or parts are assembled prior to release.
          The performing work center will order/maintain all HAZMAT required to comply
          with TCTOs and provide document numbers to the TCTO managing agency and
          supply TCTO monitor.
          7.2.6.2.2.6. Control and release TCTO kits from LRS.
          7.2.6.2.2.7. Notify appropriate Lead Command and NAF functional managers, by
          message, when local managers anticipate a problem with TCTO compliance
          within prescribed time limits. The message should include the TCTO number and
          narrative, total units affected, total units complete, kits on hand, kits on order,
          estimated delivery date, requisition number and a narrative of the problem.

             meeting and request clarification of any requirements from QA and the
             appropriate TCTO managing agency during the meeting.
             7.2.6.2.3.3. Inventory TCTO kits for completeness prior to starting work. If a
             discrepancy exists, contact the TCTO managing agency to resolve shortages.
             7.2.6.2.3.4. Perform the inspection or modification procedures outlined in the
             TCTO and document results or findings in the MIS.
             7.2.6.2.3.5. If an inspection TCTO generates a requirement for parts, the
             performing work center creates a new JCN and enters the discrepancy in the
             AFTO Form/IMT 781A or applicable equipment record and orders the required
             parts. Inspection TCTOs are complete when the inspection is finished.
             7.2.6.2.3.6. Order and maintain all HAZMAT required to comply with TCTOs
             and provide document numbers to the TCTO managing agency and supply TCTO
             monitor.
             7.2.6.2.3.7. Validate technical instructions and data on AFTO IMT 82,
             Certificate-Proofing TCTOs/Kits, when performing TCTO kit proofing IAW TO
             00-5-15.
             7.2.6.2.3.8. (Added-AETC) Perform an initial evaluation of TCTO compliance
             on TCTOs determined to need an initial evaluation. Work centers, in coordination
             with QA, determine the need for an initial evaluation based on the complexity of
             the TCTO as well as the criticality of the system or component modified.
  7.2.7. TCIs. PS&D has over-arching responsibility for the wing TCI program. Schedulers
  identify, monitor, forecast and schedule only those selected items specifically identified in
  TO 00-20-9, Forecasting Replacement Requirements for Selected Calendar and Hourly Time
  Change Items; applicable commodity TOs; the aircraft Dash-6 TO, AFI 21-201 or identified
  as FSG 13 and Materiel Management Code AQ Items.
      7.2.7.1. PS&D personnel will:
         7.2.7.1.1. Establish a JST for both the DOM and DOI for Cartridge-Actuated Devices
         (CAD), Propellant Actuated Devices (PAD), life sustaining, and other TCI items
         listed in the aircraft Dash-6 TO and applicable commodity TOs.
         7.2.7.1.2. Load only the DOI or DOM JST, that comes due first, in the MIS against a
         specific part or serial number. As a minimum, when the DOI and DOM frequencies
         are identical, maintain the JST for the DOM. (N/A for G081 units)
      7.2.7.2. TCI Forecasting. Forecasting of CAD/PAD items for long-term CAD/PAD spare
      requirements will be accomplished by OO-ALC through use of the Requirements
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                              169


     Determination Module (RDM) to extract installation and due dates from the REMIS
     aircraft maintenance data collection system. Items not visible in a maintenance data
     system will continue to be forecasted by the using organization IAW TO 00-20-9,
     Forecasting Replacement Requirements for Selected Calendar and Hourly TCIs.
        7.2.7.2.1. When CAD/PAD items or forecast requirements are not visible within the
        maintenance data system (e.g., CLS managed components), units forecast for TCIs
        IAW TO 00-20-9 and AFI 21-201. In these cases, validate and consolidate TCI
        forecasts for items listed in TO 00-20-9, commodity TOs, and aircraft specific Dash-6
        TOs. Submit consolidated forecasts to the appropriate Lead Command representative
        with an info copy to munitions operations. Forward any quarterly updated forecasts to
        munitions operations.
        7.2.7.2.1. (AETC) Validation will include, as a minimum, ensuring all items are
        accounted for and quantities needed are correct. Submit a copy of annual consolidated
        forecasts to HQ AETC/A4MS.
     7.2.7.3. Initiate, validate, and submit TCI extension requests to the ALC item manager
     (IM) with info copy to munitions operations. Maintain and monitor a suspense copy of
     the extension request and follow up prior to the grounding date of the TCI. Refer to
     Technical Orders 00-20-1 and 00-20-9 for additional guidance on TCI extensions.
     Maintain a copy of the ALC/System Program Director (SPD) approved message until the
     item is replaced.
     7.2.7.3. (AETC) Identify the item in the MIS as ―extended.‖ For example, IMDS-CDB
     units may establish a new JST with the part number and serial number of the extended
     item reflecting the new due date. The intent is for the unit to maintain the original due
     date and the approved extended due date. The extension period becomes the new due
     time.
        7.2.7.3.1. EM section will generate engine TCI extension requests and send requests
        directly to the ALC.
        7.2.7.3.2. Monthly, perform aircraft resynchronization for each aircraft that had TCIs
        accomplished
     7.2.7.4. The IM will either satisfy demand for parts by directing shipment (depot or
     inter-command RDO) of assets or approve TCI extensions as appropriate. IMs are
     authorized to direct inter-command redistribution of CAD/PAD parts as required.
     7.2.7.5. Participate in a monthly reconciliation of all TCIs with FSC. The reconciliation
     will consist of 100 percent validation of existing due-outs and a complete physical
     inventory of all issued TCIs. Inform FSC of any "mark for" changes or items no longer
     required.
     7.2.7.5. (AETC) Units supplied by COMBS are not required to accomplish a complete
     physical inventory.
     7.2.7.6. Monitor and requisition TCI requirements based on projected equipment
     utilization. Order parts using ILS-S, if available. Unless otherwise specified in Dash-11,
     Dash-14 and Dash-6 TOs. TCIs are considered due for replacement at the HPO, PH, PE,
     HSC or ISO inspection nearest to the replacement date.

         7.2.7.6.1. Notify the Munitions Flight of the need to order munitions items IAW TO
         00-20-9 and AFI 21-201. CAD/PAD TCIs with 9 months or less service life
         remaining may be turned into munitions operations and must not be reissued.
         Maintenance plans must reflect replacement dates to coincide within the 9-month
         parameter.
         7.2.7.6.2. Order non-CAD/PAD or engine TCIs IAW AFMAN 23-110.
      7.2.7.7. Schedule the time change in the MIS and incorporate it in the monthly/weekly
      maintenance plan.
      7.2.7.8. Review the data entered by the performing work center and update the suspense
      validation in the MIS when the time change is completed (N/A to units using G081).
         7.2.7.8.1. (Added-AETC) Each performing work center supervisor will ensure
         every TCI component is input into the MIS by part number, serial number (if
         applicable), lot number, date of manufacture and (or) installation, and position
         installed. In those cases where the lot number and the date of manufacture do not
         match, refer to TO 11A-1-10, Air Force Munitions Surveillance Program and
         Serviceability Procedures, for guidance. Delete items replaced from the data base
         after the not repairable this station (NRTS) action has been documented or XB3-
         coded TCIs are replaced. When replacing components, ensure each new item is
         properly identified. Pay particular attention to CAD and PAD items and engine
         modules where replacement frequency or type make series modification (TMSM)
         may vary for different part numbers or for designated dash-6 TO components for
         which historical documents are maintained.
      7.2.7.9. Coordinate management of respective TCIs with egress, and AFE sections.
      7.2.7.10. Schedule drogue chute TCIs, except chute harnesses, for replacement during
      the drogue chute repack before the expiration of the component service or shelf life.
      These components will not be over flown without an approved waiver from the
      appropriate item manager.
      7.2.7.11. Prepare TCI forecasts IAW TO 00-20-9. Provide squadron MOO/SUPTs a
      forecast for non-munitions items for their supply section.
      7.2.7.12. Validate TCI requirements 45-60 days prior to the next quarter with the
      MASO. Validate current requirements against the annual forecast and make corrections
      based on aircraft utilization.
      7.2.7.13. (Added-AETC) PS&D will verify the availability of TCIs with the munitions
      accountable systems officer (MASO) according to AFI 21-201/AETC Sup 1. Once
      notified the part is available, incorporate the replacement in the weekly schedule. Update
      AF Form 68, Munitions Authorization Record, for the MASO according to AFI 21-201.
  7.2.8. Aircraft Generation Planning. The AF IMT 2408, Generation Maintenance Plan; AF
  IMT 2409, Generation Sequence Action Schedule, (GSAS); or Lead Command approved
  automated equivalents will be used to manage aircraft generation sequence actions for
  various unit taskings. The AF IMT 2408 reflects the hour sequence of all actions necessary to
  launch aircraft and contains a locally established legend indicating the type aircraft and
  tasked mission. The AF IMT 2409 shows the actions necessary to generate a specific line
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               171


  number. Use locally established codes for maintenance shown in the action column blocks
  and to report maintenance actions during generation. The AF IMT 2408 and AF IMT 2409
  are not required for AETC/AFMC units without a mobility tasking. PS&D personnel will:
     7.2.8.1. Develop, coordinate and prepare all aircraft maintenance flow plans in
     conjunction with Maintenance Operations, WWM and MUNS personnel.
     7.2.8.2. Prepare the GSAS in sufficient detail to satisfy all generation actions. A
     completed GSAS requires only the aircraft serial number assignment and the 24-hour
     clock time annotation. Each plan must not exceed unit resources (i.e., load crews,
     equipment, convoys per hour, supervision, etc.).
     7.2.8.3. Forward the completed GSAS IMT to affected activities at the beginning of the
     generation sequence.
     7.2.8.4. Compare GSAS plans semi-annually with the unit DOC statement to ensure
     compatibility with the mission.
     7.2.8.5. Attend post exercise/contingency ―hot wash‖ meetings to evaluate flow plans for
     changes or improvements.
     7.2.8.6. Classification Guidance. If classified data is used to populate the 2408/2409s,
     classify the 2408/2409 IAW the guidance of the originating document (i.e. Warning
     Order, ATO, etc.). In general, using real world/exercise mission numbers, take-off times,
     and tail numbers may lead to conditions where the 2408/2409 contains classified
     information.
  7.2.9. Transfer Inspections. Units perform gaining/losing transfer inspections IAW TO 00-
  20-1, Lead Command guidance and this instruction.
     7.2.9.1. In conjunction with QA, develop a local JST/work package for both gaining and
     losing aircraft and equipment transfer inspection. This JST/work package must meet all
     00-20-1, 2J-1-18, applicable aircraft Dash-6 and Dash-21 TOs, as well as AFI 21-103 and
     Lead Command specific transfer requirements. Include historical records (e.g., NDI
     records, Egress records, W&B records, OAP records, strut records) and other items.
     7.2.9.2. Losing PS&D ensures all actions are completed in the MIS prior to permanently
     transferring an aircraft to another unit.
     7.2.9.3. Losing PS&D conducts a transfer pre-dock meeting one duty day prior to start of
     the aircraft transfer inspection. All items to be accomplished during the transfer
     inspection will be documented on an AF IMT 2410, or locally developed product, and
     scheduled in the MIS.
     7.2.9.4. Losing PS&D completes a total verification of all TCIs installed on the
     transferring aircraft. Verify the correct computation of all due dates/hour/cycles based on
     DOM, DOI, installed times, etc.
     7.2.9.5. For IMDS units only:
         7.2.9.5.1. Ensure the IMDS - REMIS synchronization programs are processed and
         errors are corrected prior to transfer.
172                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


         7.2.9.5.2. Ensure an up-to-date Transfer of Equipment (TRE) report and an AFTO
         IMT 95 with current engine trend and performance data are placed in the aircraft
         jacket file. A backup copy will be maintained by the losing unit until receipt is
         verified by gaining unit.
      7.2.9.6. Losing PS&D ensure an ADR is performed and conduct a transfer post dock
      meeting to ensure all required actions have been completed and all forms are
      current/accurate.
  7.2.10. Acceptance Inspections. Units perform acceptance inspections IAW TO 00-20-1,
  Lead Command guidance and this instruction.
  7.2.10. (AETC) Refer to TO 00-20-1, AETC Supplement for acceptance and transfer
  inspection requirements.
  7.2.11. Aircraft Jacket Files.
      7.2.11.1. Establish jacket files for aircraft and maintenance historical documents IAW
      AFMAN 33-363 and TO 00-20-1. Aircraft jacket files will be maintained in PS&D and
      standardized IAW the master aircraft historical file developed by PS&D NCOIC.
      Documents decentralized to sections maintaining installed-on equipment (e.g., fuel cell
      records at fuel systems section, landing gear strut records at hydraulics section) are filed
      by, and the responsibility of, the OWC. PS&D will list all historical records, including
      those decentralized in their file plan or office of record. The DD Form 2861, Cross-
      Reference, will be used to cross-reference documents decentralized from PS&D to other
      sections. PS&D personnel will:
         7.2.11.1.1. Ensure individual documents are kept for end items, subsystems and
         components IAW 00-20 series TOs, this instruction, AFMAN 33-363, AF Records
         Disposition        Schedule         located       at      https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
         af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm and applicable Dash-6 TOs. MIS automated history is
         used in place of AFTO IMT 95 to document significant historical events on aircraft,
         engines, AGE and armament equipment. A copy of a MIS automated history must be
         down loaded (on a CD) annually and be available at all times. Documents for non-
         powered AGE, training equipment and common equipment items requiring very little
         maintenance documentation may be grouped together in a single folder or area to
         eliminate keeping a record folder on each individual item. When this is done,
         documents for similar items should be grouped together and the recorded information
         should be identifiable to particular pieces of equipment.
         7.2.11.1.2. When aircraft are temporarily moved to operating locations away from
         the unit of assignment, send only those documents necessary to ensure safety of flight
         and current aircraft status. Units will develop written procedures for records taken to
         deployed locations based on duration of TDY and peculiar operating requirements.
         When pertinent documents are not sent with the aircraft, accumulated airframe hours,
         TCTO status, TCI status data on installed engines and critical components are sent
         from the operating location to the parent unit as specified by Lead Command
         instructions.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                              173


       7.2.11.1.3. Review aircraft jacket files and associated decentralized records annually
       using the PS&D-developed checklist. The last completed checklist must be kept on
       file in each aircraft jacket file.
       7.2.11.1.3. (AETC) Units may attach an AF Form 2411, Inspection Document, to
       the front of each historical jacket file to record the completion of each jacket file
       review. If AF Form 2411 is not used, completion of jacket file review will be
       documented on the AFTO Form 95.
          7.2.11.1.3.1. (Added-AETC) During aircraft jacket file annual review, P&S will
          accomplish the following minimum requirements:
              7.2.11.1.3.1.1. (Added-AETC) Ensure all items requiring an AFTO Form 95
              (or automated version) according to the applicable dash-6 TO are complete,
              accurate and filed appropriately. (AFTO Form 95 is prescribed by TO 00-20-
              1. Refer to this publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
              7.2.11.1.3.1.2. (Added-AETC) Ensure the egress planning requirement
              (PRA) on file is current, accurate, and contains a signature from egress. When
              TCIs are changed between inspections, PS&D will update the aircraft PRA on
              file with the information taken from the suspense using red ink. This updated
              PRA may remain on file until replaced by an updated, verified, and signed
              PRA or until the next completed CAD and PAD verification.
              7.2.11.1.3.1.3. (Added-AETC) Review TO 00-20-1 for a list of required
              forms and ensure they are on file.
              7.2.11.1.3.1.4. (Added-AETC) Ensure there is a copy of the last records
              check. Ensure there are copies of the last inspection packages. Refer to AFI
              21-101, paragraph 7.2.3.
       7.2.11.1.4. Maintain inactive (pulled) AFTO Form/IMT 781 series IAW AFMAN
       33-363 and dispose of IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule located at
       https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. If forms are missing,
       send a missing form letter to the appropriate section NCOIC with a 5 duty-day
       suspense. If a response is not returned within 5 duty days, notify maintenance
       supervision. If the forms cannot be located, file the missing form letter, endorsed by
       the section NCOIC and maintenance supervision, in the aircraft jacket file in place of
       the missing forms. See TO 00-20-1 for missing form procedures. Units using fully
       automated forms will maintain the last 7 copies of the aircraft forms. When the 8th
       report is received, destroy the earliest record. Units not required to use MIS, will use
       aircraft forms maintaining the current and last 3 month’s worth of closed aircraft
       forms .Note: Units that are utilizing laptop forms only (i.e.. Integrated Maintenance
       Information System (IMIS), Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS)) do not
       need to maintain 7 sets of 781 forms.
       7.2.11.1.5. Because PS&D is centralized in MOF, Debrief may maintain the last
       seven pulled sets of 781s from the aircraft forms binder in a consolidated file. The
       debrief records will be inspected quarterly by MOF PS&D to ensure effective control
       and organization. MOF PS&D will annotate in the aircraft jacket file the 781s are in a
       decentralized location and reference file plan location.

7.3. Operations and Maintenance Planning Cycle. Lead Commands shall develop procedures
to ensure the intent of the operational planning cycle is met. The objective of the operational
planning cycle is to execute the wing flying hour program consistent with operational
requirements and maintenance capabilities. The operational planning cycle begins with the
annual allocation of flying hours and UTE rates. Maintenance and operations schedulers will
propose an annual flying plan balancing both operational requirements and maintenance
capabilities. The annual plan, detailed by month, will evaluate the capability of maintenance to
support the annual flying hour program. The plan will be developed, coordinated and
consolidated jointly by Operations Support Squadron (OSS) Current Operations Flight
Scheduling, and PS&D. The printed wing plan will include an assessment of the wing’s ability
to execute the flying hour program. The plan will be coordinated with the OG/CC and MXG CC
before being approved by the WG/CC. Commit the fewest number of aircraft possible to meet
programmed UTE rate standards and goals.
   7.3.1. If applicable, Lead Commands shall develop scheduling procedures for units involved
   in Operational Test and Evaluation, Developmental Test and Evaluation, or Initial
   Operational Test and Evaluation to ensure the intent of the flying and maintenance planning
   cycle is met.
7.4. First Look Requirements. The First Look report is an internal wing document intended to
highlight potential maintenance-capacity and operational-requirement disconnects in the
upcoming year. Every year, on or about 15 March, PS&D will task MMA to provide PS&D with
an airframe capabilities assessment. This assessment will take into account personnel, facilities,
and airfield infrastructure for each aircraft maintenance organization NLT the last workday of
March.
   7.4.1. PS&D will provide copies of the capability study to each OS scheduling section and
   maintenance supervision. PS&D will provide first look maintenance capability projections in
   a monthly format IAW Lead Command procedures. Projections include operational
   requirements, an assessment of maintenance’s ability to support the monthly requirement and
   an overall assessment of the unit’s maintenance capability to meet the annual flying hour
   program. (N/A for MAF units).
   7.4.2. OS and maintenance responses are sent to PS&D and OSS Current Operations Flight
   Scheduling and are consolidated into a comprehensive package that includes a breakdown of
   the following items by OS:
       7.4.2.1. Sortie UTE Rates (N/A to MAF units). Compute UTE rates by month for the
       entire fiscal year for contracted (required) sorties and scheduled sorties using the formula:
       (number of sorties per month) divided by (number of PAI aircraft).
       7.4.2.1. (AETC) Refer to AETCI 21-105 for additional information on computing
       utilization (UTE) rates.
       7.4.2.2. Sorties contracted/scheduled per day (N/A to MAF units). Compute the number
       of sorties required per operations and maintenance (O&M) day to meet the operational
       requirement using the formula: (Number of sorties required) divided by (number of O&M
       days in a given month). Sorties per day will be computed by month for the entire fiscal
       year.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               175


       7.4.2.3. Monthly scheduled sorties (N/A to MAF units). Compute monthly scheduled
       sortie requirements using the formula: (Number of sorties or hours required) divided by
       (1 minus the attrition factor). Example: (1,000 sorties or hours required) divided by (1
       minus 0.15) equals 1,177 sorties or hours to schedule. Remember to round any part to the
       next whole sortie or hour.
       7.4.2.4. Inspection dock capability. Compute the number of PH/ISO inspections to be
       accomplished for each maintenance unit, by month, for the entire fiscal year in order to
       meet operational requirements. Compute dock capability using the formula (number of
       O&M days) divided by (number of PH/ISO days) times (inspection cycle). Inspection
       dock capability is provided at the wing level and provided by the squadron performing
       inspections.
   7.4.3. Once compiled, packages shall be presented to the OG and MXG/CCs before being
   presented to the WG/CC.
7.4. (AETC) First Look Requirements. First look requirements will be due to HQ
AETC/A4MMA by 31 October of each year. For example, requirements would be due on 31
October 2011 (the first month of FY 12) for consideration in the FY 13 flying hour program.
This will ensure maintenance capabilities are considered at both the unit and headquarters prior
to PFT conferences each year. Although there is no PFT conference for the ―T‖ designated
aircraft, MMA must provide historical data to PS&D in order to begin the development of future
plans.
7.5. Annual Maintenance Planning Cycle. Lead Commands shall develop procedures to
ensure the objectives of the annual maintenance planning cycle are met. At a minimum, Lead
Command procedures will produce an annual flying and maintenance plan that allocates sorties
and hours into quarters, is approved by the wing commander, and published prior to the
beginning of the fiscal year.
   7.5.1. Flying Hour Allocation. Using the Lead Command Baseline Allocation message,
   PS&D and OS/OSS scheduling provide affected work centers the following planning factors
   NLT 20 August each year, or within 10 working days after receipt of the flying hour
   allocations:
       7.5.1.1. Updated capabilities computed by MMA, provided by PS&D.
       7.5.1.2. Required flying hours and estimated sorties and missions, provided by OSS, in
       monthly increments.
       7.5.1.3. Flying days in each month, provided by OSS.
       7.5.1.4. Aircraft and aircrew alert requirements, provided by OSS.
       7.5.1.5. Known and projected TDY and special mission requirements, provided by OSS.
       7.5.1.6. PDM schedule, provided by PS&D.
       7.5.1.7. Configuration and munitions requirements, provided by OSS.
   7.5.2. NLT 1 September, or within 10 working days after receipt of the planning factors,
   maintenance supervision provides PS&D, SQ/CCs, and OSS operations scheduling the
   following planning factors:
 176                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


       7.5.2.1. Estimated number of aircraft available by month, taking into consideration
       aircraft required for training.
       7.5.2.2. A projected airframe capability statement.
       7.5.2.3. Forecasted personnel capability, taking into consideration required annual
       training for maintenance personnel. (Not applicable to contract maintenance
       organizations).
       7.5.2.4. The number of supportable sorties for each month.
       7.5.2.5. An estimated monthly attrition factor (N/A to MAF units) provided by MMA.
       This factor combines operations, weather and materiel (maintenance and supply) factors.
       Maintenance is responsible for adding the attrition factor to operational requirements.
       7.5.2.6. A recommended block scheduling pattern.
       7.5.2.7. A statement of limitations.
7.5. (AETC) Annual Maintenance Planning Cycle. AETCI 21-104 provides procedures for
the annual maintenance planning cycle. Planning is a four-phase process. The first phase is to
develop a quarterly plan beginning with the current month and reaching out 2 months into the
future. The second phase is to refine the quarterly plan into a monthly plan. In the third phase,
each weekly portion of the monthly plan is further refined to produce a weekly schedule. The last
phase of the planning process is to verify maintenance, training, and operational requirements
and finalize the daily portion of the weekly schedule.
7.6. Quarterly Maintenance and Operations Planning. Lead Commands will develop
procedures to ensure the objectives of the Quarterly Planning cycle are met. Quarterly planning
starts with the operational requirement for flying hours, UTE rate, airframe availability, alert and
other related scheduling data. The OS operations officer provides these requirements to
maintenance supervision and PS&D NLT 25 days before the beginning of the quarter.
Maintenance supervision and the OS operations officer discuss these requirements at the
scheduling meeting before the quarter being planned.
   7.6.1. Schedulers ensure quarterly plans are as detailed and accurate as possible. Include
   known special missions, PDM schedules, HHQ commitments and lateral command support
   requirements. All maintenance requirements will be consolidated into a single quarterly plan
   using AF IMT 2401, Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedule or computer
   generated form. As a minimum, the quarterly plan shows the current month and the next 2
   months planned sorties and known maintenance requirements. Known maintenance
   requirements include all maintenance events that impact aircraft availability and other
   maintenance events which require management attention to ensure smooth flow of
   scheduling/completion. Maintenance events should be consolidated during a single down
   period to the greatest extent possible. As a minimum, include calendar inspections that
   prevent operational utilization for that day(s) flying schedule, calendar TCIs, TCTOs in
   workable status, PDM schedules, training aircraft, cannibalization aircraft and aircraft
   ISO/PE/PH inspections. Specific locally developed codes will be used to identify each
   different SI, TCI and TCTO on the AF IMT 2401. Other maintenance requirements, such as
   engine changes, hourly requirements, acceptance/transfer inspections, training aircraft and
   cannibalization aircraft will be posted as they become known or planned. Add AME
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 177


   inspections to the quarterly plan if the aircraft is scheduled to stay in that configuration to
   ensure the inspections are included in the monthly and weekly schedules. Refine monthly and
   weekly schedules to ensure the quarterly plan objectives are met while staying within the
   maintenance capability. Use the following priority to determine which objectives to support
   if a lack of resources prevents meeting requirements:
       7.6.1.1. Alert commitments
       7.6.1.2. HHQ directed missions.
       7.6.1.3. Training.
   7.6.2. The OG/CC and MXG/CC chair a quarterly meeting NLT 14 days before the next
   quarter. OSS Current Operations Flight scheduling compiles, coordinates and briefs the
   unit’s quarterly plan and includes operational requirements, support capability and any
   difficulties expected. Once an approved quarterly plan is established, OSS Current
   Operations Flight Scheduling will forward a copy to OS, AMXS, OG and MXG/CCs along
   with all scheduling agencies. The plan will be posted so it may be viewed by both
   maintenance and operations.
7.7. Monthly Maintenance and Operations Planning. Lead Commands will develop
procedures to ensure the objectives of the monthly planning cycle is met. Forecast and monitor
requirements for the current and next 2 months. Include predictable maintenance factors based
on historical data along with other inputs, such as flow times for maintenance, turnaround times
and parts replacement schedules. Include all known operational events (e.g., exercises,
deployments, surges) to determine maintenance’s capability to meet operational needs. The OS
operations officers and maintenance supervision shall review their applicable portion of the
monthly maintenance plan and weekly schedule prior to submission to PS&D. To optimize
aircraft and munitions support, MXS, AMXS, and OS shall ensure the number of aircraft and/or
munitions configurations are minimized and standardized. The monthly schedule refines the
quarterly plan:
   7.7.1. NLT the first weekly scheduling meeting of the month, the OS operations officer
   provides maintenance supervision and PS&D with the estimated operational needs for the
   following month in as much detail as possible. Include known takeoff times, landing times
   and flying hour windows. Note: Landing times are not required if the unit has an established
   and constant average sortie duration.
   7.7.2. NLT the second weekly scheduling meeting of the month, maintenance supervision
   tells the OS operations officer whether requirements can be met or limitations exist. Make
   adjustments to the proposed schedule to satisfy maintenance and operational requirements.
   7.7.3. NLT the third weekly scheduling meeting of the month, formalize next month’s plan
   prior to presenting it to the WG/CC for approval. During the Wing/CC’s monthly meeting,
   OS scheduling outlines past accomplishments, status of flying goals, problems encountered
   and detailed needs for the next month. PS&D outlines projected maintenance capability and
   aircraft/equipment availability. If conflicts arise between operational requirements and
   maintenance capability, present alternatives and limitations. MXG/CC, OG/CC and WG/CC
   decide what portion of the mission to support and to what degree.
178                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


  7.7.4. When the WG/CC approves the proposed monthly flying plan, PS&D includes it as a
  portion of the monthly flying and maintenance plan. Monthly plans may be published
  electronically provided local security requirements are met.
  7.7.4. (AETC) The plan may be published as a monthly plan or as an annex to the last
  weekly schedule on the preceding month.
  7.7.5. The monthly flying and maintenance plan combines all aspects of aircraft utilization
  and includes:
      7.7.5.1. A detailed monthly operations utilization calendar that specifies total aircraft
      flying hours, total sorties and missions, alert requirements, scheduled sortie or mission
      requirements and daily turn plans for each MDS by squadron, group or wing. Do not
      assign attrition sorties to a specific aircrew/mission for the monthly planning process.
      7.7.5.2. Monthly maintenance requirements (as required)
      7.7.5.3. Transient work schedule, if applicable.
      7.7.5.4. Scheduled inspections, TCTOs, engine changes, time changes, DDs, contract or
      depot maintenance, washes, corrosion control, training aircraft and all other known
      maintenance requirements.
      7.7.5.5. SE scheduled inspections, contract or depot maintenance, TCTOs, time changes,
      DDs, washes and corrosion control.
      7.7.5.6. Avionics and other off-equipment maintenance scheduled inspections, TCTOs,
      assembly or repair operations.
      7.7.5.7. Engine/module 6-month removal forecast and in-shop inspection requirements.
      7.7.5.7. (AETC) In-shop maintenance requirements will be published. Completing the
      AETC Form 520, Engine Maintenance and Inspection Forecast, fulfills engine
      requirements.
      7.7.5.8. Munitions, photo, ECM and other mission loading or configuration
      requirements, including ammunition changes.
      7.7.5.9. Total ordnance requirements for aircraft support.
      7.7.5.10. Tanks, racks, adapters and pylons (TRAP) and WRM scheduled inspections,
      TCTOs, assembly or repair operations.

           7.7.5.13.7. Airfield operations.
       7.7.5.14. (Added-AETC) Other items as directed by the wing commander.
7.8. Weekly Scheduling. The weekly schedule is the final refinement to the monthly plan and
results in the weekly flying and maintenance schedule. Lead Commands will develop procedures
to ensure the objectives of the weekly scheduling process are met. The OS operations officer and
maintenance supervision will review and coordinate on the proposed weekly flying and
maintenance schedule with OS, AMXS and MXS prior to presenting it to OG and MXG CCs.
The group-approved schedule will be submitted to PS&D for compilation and a complete copy
provided to the WG/CC. At the weekly scheduling meeting, evaluate the past week's
accomplishments (to include flying and MSE) and negotiate/approve refinements to the coming
week's schedule. (The AF IMT 2402, Weekly Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedule,
is used to summarize the upcoming week’s schedule.) The AF IMT 2403, Weekly Aircraft
Utilization/Maintenance Schedule; and AF IMT 2436, Weekly/Daily Aircraft Utilization
Schedule; are more finite in the depiction of aircraft utilization and maintenance. The AF IMT
2403 and AF Form 2436 may be used together or individually. Electronic versions of the above
IMTs/forms are authorized. Whatever IMTs/forms are used, all requirements will be entered.
Weekly schedules may be published electronically provided local security requirements are met.
   7.8.1. NLT 2 workdays before the weekly scheduling meeting, the OS operations officer
   gives maintenance supervision the following information (as required):
       7.8.1.1. Aircraft takeoff and landing times.
       7.8.1.2. Configuration requirements.
       7.8.1.3. Munitions requirements.
       7.8.1.4. Fuel loads.
       7.8.1.5. Special or peculiar mission support requirements.
       7.8.1.6. Alert requirements.
       7.8.1.7. Exercise vulnerability.
       7.8.1.8. Deployments.
       7.8.1.9. Off-base sorties.
       7.8.1.10. On equipment training requirements.
       7.8.1.11. Other special requirements.
       7.8.1.12. (Added-AETC) Scheduled utilization and maintenance actions by aircraft and
       equipment serial number, to include sortie line number.
       7.8.1.13. (Added-AETC) Estimated requirements for petroleum, oil, and lubricants
       (POL) when required, to include number of trucks, refueling pits, and times required.
       7.8.1.14. (Added-AETC) Aircraft and equipment required to support ground-training
       requirements.

  7.8.2. Once the weekly schedule is reviewed and signed by the OG/CC, MXG/CC and
  WG/CC it becomes the final planning guide for both operations and maintenance and the
  basis for deviation reporting. The schedule will be followed as printed or as amended by
  coordinated changes. Coordinated changes do not negate reporting deviations IAW Lead
  Command guidance. PS&D distributes the schedule to each appropriate activity and work
  center NLT 1200 (1400 for AETC) Friday preceding the effective week. Weekly flying and
  maintenance schedules may be transmitted electronically provided local security
  requirements are met.
  7.8.2. (AETC) The weekly schedule will also be reviewed and signed by the wing
  commander. File the original signed copy in PS&D, and maintain it according to the Air
  Force RDS.
      7.8.2.1. Tanker/Airlift Control Center (TACC) tasked units (MAF units) will use the
      daily flying schedule as the basis for deviation reporting.
  7.8.3. Home and deployed units will publish a weekly schedule. Include the following in the
  weekly flying and maintenance schedule:
      7.8.3.1. Sortie sequence numbers, aircraft tail numbers (primary and spares), scheduled
      takeoff and landing times, aircraft or equipment scheduled use times, configurations and
      special equipment requirements. Units tasked by TACC need not include aircraft tail
      numbers. Units that fly a published and constant average sortie duration need not publish
      land times.
      7.8.3.2. Spare aircraft requirements. Spare requirements are printed by day for each
      maintenance unit. Generate only the absolute minimum of spare aircraft.
      7.8.3.3. Scheduled maintenance actions, by aircraft and equipment serial number, to
      include inspections, TCTOs, time changes, contract and depot inputs, engine changes,
      washes or corrosion control, document reviews and DDs.

      if available.
      7.8.3.9. Lead Commands will develop specific procedures to record and coordinate
      changes to the weekly schedule using an AF IMT 2407. Include minimum approval
      levels for approving changes to the weekly schedule.
      7.8.3.9. (AETC) See AETCI 21-104 for additional requirements when using AF Form
      2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination.
      7.8.3.10. Any change to the printed schedule will require an AF IMT 2407 with the
      following Note: a change to the original printed takeoff or landing time of 15 minutes or
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               181


       less; a change of aircrew names, ranges, or airspace; or a change arising after the first
       crew ready time for the squadron’s current day’s scheduled flying window.
          7.8.3.10.1. Changes made during the daily scheduling meeting also require an AF
          IMT 2407.
          7.8.3.10.2. The agency requesting the change initiates the AF IMT 2407 and
          coordinates it through the affected Pro Super, Operations Officer/MX SUPT, and
          required group staff agencies (i.e., MOC, PS&D, etc.) IAW Lead Command
          procedures.
          7.8.3.10.3. (Added-AETC) Units will load flying schedules in the MIS by 1500 on
          Friday of the week preceding the effective week or prior to the daily scheduling
          meeting for the next day. Loading the schedule in the MIS makes status and deviation
          reporting easier and more accurate.
7.8. (AETC) Weekly Scheduling. PS&D will produce and deliver a reproducible or electronic
copy of the weekly utilization and maintenance schedule, on Friday of the week preceding the
effective week. Use an Air Force general purpose form, locally approved form, or locally
developed spreadsheet to build the weekly schedule.
7.9. AMU/AMXS dedicated scheduler AMU dedicated schedulers are assigned to the
MOF PS&D provide dedicated support to the AMUs . AMU element schedulers will:
   7.9.1. Attend and actively participate in daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly flying
   scheduling programs and meetings IAW this chapter and:
       7.9.1.1. Inform AMU supervision of maintenance capabilities or limiting factors that
       could affect maintenance production.
       7.9.1.2. Coordinate with AMU supervision and OS operations schedulers when
       scheduling AMU aircraft to meet flying requirements.
       7.9.1.3. Coordinate the scheduled use of shared resources. Changes during the affected
       week will be documented on an AF IMT 2407.
       7.9.1.4. Provide a listing of JCNs for next week’s scheduled maintenance to the PS&D
       NCOIC by 1600 Friday if JCNs are not listed in the weekly flying and maintenance
       schedule. This list will be used to track MSE. AMU PS&D element will assist in
       determining causes of missed maintenance for reporting MSE.
   7.9.2. Manage the following programs for aircraft assigned to their appointed AMU:
   TCTOs, TCIs and SIs (including installed engine inspections) IAW guidance in this chapter.
7.10. Wing Aerospace Vehicle Distribution Officer (AVDO). PS&D performs the AVDO
function IAW AFI 21-103 and maintains the inventory portion of the MIS Inventory, Status and
Utilization subsystem. AVDO will:
   7.10.1. Generate AFTO IMT 103, Aircraft/Missile Condition Data, to record certified
   maintenance needs for aircraft PDM IAW TO 00-25-4, Depot Maintenance of Aerospace
   Vehicles and Training Equipment, coordinate it with AMXS supervision

  7.10.3. Maintain a PDM schedule by tail/serial number for all aircraft and equipment in
  support of AFMC and Lead Command plans and requirements. This listing will contain all
  Lead Command directed modification and maintenance programs. Publish these schedules in
  monthly and quarterly maintenance plans.
  7.10.4. Manage the aircraft transfer/depot program. Coordinate any changes to the
  transfer/depot/ DFT/CFT programs with AMU and all affected agencies.
  7.10.5. Coordinate with PS&D and QA on all AFTO IMT 103s and submit them IAW TO
  00-25-4. Coordinate any resulting changes to the depot program with affected scheduling
  functions.
  7.10.6. Comply with Dash-21 equipment accountability requirements in AFI 21-103 and
  Lead Command supplements.
  7.10.7. Job Standard Master Listing (JML) Management. PS&D maintains (load, change,
  and delete) the JML for all inspections and time changes listed in the applicable aircraft
  Dash-6 and commodity TOs. The EM section maintains the portion of the JML for engine
  inspections and time changes. Maintain JMLs for off-equipment items in the OWC. Provide
  written guidance and training for JML management of off-equipment Job Standards (JSTs)
  when PS&D authorizes OWCs to maintain it. For units using G081, Lead Command weapon
  system managers must maintain master inspection and time change requirements. Once
  Master Job Standard Numbers (MJSNs) are fielded for a weapon system, local PS&D must
  review TO 00-20-2 for MJSN procedures. PS&D must load, change and delete JSTs in the
  MIS as soon as possible after receipt of any Dash-6, or other TO, TCI or inspection change
  and promptly notify all affected PS&D sections for action. PS&D shall:
      7.10.7.1. Load JSTs for all aircraft Dash-6 special/scheduled inspections with
      frequencies greater than 30 days or 50 hours in the MIS. PE, PH, engine changes and
      other event type inspections as they occur (e.g., hard landing) are loaded as a JST in the
      MIS. Provide training for maintaining JSTs as necessary.
      7.10.7.2. Perform a semi-annual review of the JML and all JSTs for accuracy and
      currency. Reconcile TCI and SI JSTs with the aircraft Dash-6 and applicable commodity
      TOs. Document the semi-annual review on AF IMT 2411. Units may create JSTs in the
      MIS to automate required documentation of repetitive complex tasks (e.g., engine
      change, phase inspection, flight control maintenance).
      7.10.7.2. (AETC) The MXG/CC may approve locally developed job flow packages,
      forms or lists, or SE forms to record recurring maintenance tasks for aircraft and trainers.
      Job flow packages created in the MIS will provide fully integrated and annotated
      electronic preprints to these recurring tasks. If used:
         7.10.7.2.1. (Added-AETC) Locally developed maintenance packages or job flow
         packages will be developed in the MIS for recurring maintenance tasks where the
         requirements of the action are normally constant. Examples of such tasks include, but
         are not limited to, PE, PH, and ISO inspections; engine removal and reinstallation;
         aircraft wash and lubrication; aircraft complete strip and paint; and wing removal and
         reinstallation. These automated job flow packages will be scheduled in the MIS and
         new AFTO Forms 781A will be printed as needed.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                              183


         7.10.7.2.2. (Added-AETC) Locally approved forms or lists may be used to record
         removal of access panels from aircraft or SE undergoing scheduled inspection or
         extensive recurring maintenance; for example, wing removal and replacement, flight
         control rigging, TCTO compliance, etc. Locally approved forms or lists will have a
         date on each page so previous versions can be easily identified and purged.
         7.10.7.2.3. (AETC) QA will publish guidance in an OI to ensure proper use, control,
         and documentation of locally developed profile job flow packages, forms, and lists.
         As a minimum, QA will review all profile job flow packages before they are used and
         before PS&D inputs them into the MIS. QA will maintain an inventory of forms and
         lists used within maintenance.
     7.10.7.3. Develop a matrix/chart depicting the total number of SI and TCI requirements
     to be loaded in the MIS for each assigned aircraft and verify against the MIS totals
     weekly. Overdue and uncorrected discrepancies must be briefed weekly during a wing
     daily production/scheduling meeting.
     7.10.7.3. (AETC) MSAT may be used to maintain the SI and TCI matrix.
     7.10.7.4. Monitor the inspection and time change subsystems in the MIS. Perform a
     comprehensive quarterly review of all inspections, SIs and TCI JSTs for each assigned
     aircraft. Look for missing and/or excess inspections and TCIs loaded to the aircraft.
     Ensure the accuracy of all due dates/ times for TCIs and verify the date of manufacture
     (DOM) and date of installation (DOI). Document the review, establish a suspense date
     and follow-up to ensure corrections are received. Maintain the report on file with
     corrective actions until the next review. The use of automated verification tools is
     encouraged provided MIS data is the source for verification.
  7.10.8. Maintenance Schedules. PS&D builds, coordinates, publishes and distributes an
  integrated aircraft schedule to support required maintenance and flying operations. Plans and
  schedules may be published via electronic means (e.g., web pages, CoP, or E-mail) provided
  operations security is not compromised. Normal daily operations and training schedules are
  FOUO and should not be restricted to classified systems. PS&D personnel will:
  7.10.9. In conjunction with MMA, provide planning factors for aircraft availability and
  maintenance capability to operations and maintenance managers and inform them of
  deviations from maintenance schedules.
  7.10.10. Coordinate development of the wing’s annual flying and maintenance program.
  7.10.11. Participate in the wing quarterly, monthly and weekly scheduling meetings.
  7.10.12. Participate in the daily production/scheduling meeting. Representatives from PS&D
  and EM must attend the wing daily production/scheduling meeting.
  7.10.12. (AETC) PS&D will review the MIS before each daily scheduling meeting to
  ensure scheduled maintenance actions have been completed and updated, to include verifying
  new inspection and TCI due times.
  7.10.13. Monitor aircraft utilization and maintenance resources to ensure wing programs and
  commitments are met and that shared resources and schedules are de-conflicted. Ensure
  aircraft and equipment are scheduled to meet all training needs. Review weekly and monthly
  training schedules prior to publication to minimize impact on production and facilities.
 184                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   7.10.14. Compute MSE IAW Lead Command instructions and forward data to MMA.
   7.10.14. (AETC) Maintenance scheduling effectiveness (MSE) will be computed and
   reported according to AETCI 21-104 and AETCI 21-105.
7.11. The PS&D is the wing 2R1XX functional manager. In this role, the PS&D NCOIC
will ensure the following duties are performed:
   7.11.1. Visit sections semiannually where schedulers are not centralized . During the visit,
   ensure historical documents are properly maintained. Discuss 2R1X1 rotation plan with each
   section OIC/NCOIC, and provide formal written reports of deficiencies found during the
   visits to MOF/Supt, MOS/CC, and applicable section OIC/Chief. Deficiencies will not be
   closed until validated by the MOF/SUPT (N/A ANG except for 116 ACW)
   7.11.2. Establish and coordinate plans for rotating 2R1XX personnel through various duty
   positions within MOF to increase field knowledge and experience every 24 months, not to
   exceed 36 months. This rotation plan applies to TSgts and below as well as 3- or 5-skill level
   personnel of any rank. Rotating civil service and contractor maintenance personnel is a
   local/contract management decision. (N/A to the ARC except for the 116 ACW)
   7.11.3. Perform initial evaluations for all incoming 2R1XX personnel. Initial interviews will
   be documented on the ITP journal in TBA or on an AF IMT 623A, On-the-Job Training
   Record Continuation Sheet, and filed in the individual’s training record IAW AFI 36-2201
   and Lead Command supplements.
   7.11.3. (AETC) 1 Establish a master training plan for PS&D personnel. See AFI 36-2201,
   Volume 3, Air Force Training Program On the Job Training Administration, and AETCI 21-
   103 to establish minimum requirements.
       7.11.3.1. Develop and periodically review training programs for all 2R1XX personnel.
       The training plan must include familiarization with assigned weapons systems, core task
       training/certification procedures and continued proficiency in scheduling and
       documentation techniques.
          7.11.3.1.1. Ensure personnel receive weapon system familiarization training, if not
          already familiar, through the MTF/TD within 3 months of assignment. If courses are
          not available, coordinate with the appropriate maintenance activity for familiarization
          training. Document familiarization training in the individual’s training record. For
          ARC, PS&D will attend the course within 6 months of assignment to the unit.
          7.11.3.1.2. Civil service and contractor maintenance organizations must comply with
          training plans established in the PWS, PRS or SOW.
       7.11.3.2. Provide functional expertise on all maintenance scheduling issues and
       equipment historical document (AFTO IMT 95) management to QA during
       inspection/evaluations.
       7.11.3.3. (Added-AETC) Participate in all wing scheduling meetings representing
       maintenance operations flight (MOF) PS&D responsibilities. For contract and civil
       service units, the DOM will determine appropriate representation at wing scheduling
       meetings.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                   185


7.12. Responsibilities of Contingency/Expeditionary (Cont/Exp) units (i. e. maintaining
non-assigned aircraft). Note: this does not include AMC established en-route stations
   7.12.1. Most planning and scheduling is the responsibility of units with assigned aircraft and
   is provided through reachback support to homestations. Contingency units have fewer
   responsibilities as described below. Commanders of expeditionary units will ensure the
   intent of the guidance is met, when dynamic nature of a contingency/expeditionary
   organizations make strict adherence possible.
   7.12.2. Cont/Exp PS&Ds will conduct the following programs as modified below:
   7.12.3. ADR, Pre- and Post-dock meetings, Acceptance inspections (from DFT/CFTs) and
   the Major Work Program. Cont/Exp PS&D will use the procedures developed by the aircraft
   owning organizations, they do not have to be standardized.
   7.12.4. Ensure discrepancies Noted by the aircraft owning PS&D for the ACM, TCI and SI
   programs are corrected. Cont/Exp PS&D will not develop programs independent of the
   aircraft owning organization.
   7.12.5. Develop local procedures for Aircraft Immediate and Urgent Action TCTOs. When
   notified by the aircraft owning organization of an I/UA TCTO, Cont/Exp PS&D will host a
   TCTO meeting.
      7.12.5.1. Purpose of the meeting is to determine if the Cont/Exp unit has the
      maintenance capability to perform the TCTO. Invite AMU, QA and affected work
      centers. Notify the E-MXG/CC of the unit’s capability to perform the TCTO. Develop
      and implement local tracking methodology to track TCTO completion. Update MIS when
      the aircraft owning PS&D loads the requisite JST/JCNS.
      7.12.5.2. Cont/Exp PS&D will only maintain aircraft urgent/immediate action TCTO
      files while active. Once TCTOs are completed and loaded in MIS send records to
      homestation for filing. A TCTO meeting is not necessary for Routine Action aircraft
      TCTOs.
      7.12.5.3. A full TCTO program IAW this chapter is required for AGE and other SE
      which is assigned to the contingency unit. This is intended to cover equipment that does
      not rotate with aviation packages.
      7.12.5.4. Monthly and weekly maintenance planning. Cont/Exp PS&D will produce
      maintenance plans detailing all known maintenance requirements for the upcoming
      month/week.
          7.12.5.4.1. This plan will detail by tail number, Due date, JST and a description of
          the scheduled maintenance required for the time period; use of the AF IMT 2401 is
          not required. The list will be published 2-days prior to the covered time period,
          coordinated through maintenance supervision, and approved by the MXG/CC.
          7.12.5.4.2. The weekly list will additionally identify those actions which will be
          deferred. It will specifically identify if the action is deferred for mission requirements
          or due to lack of capability. Actions which are not identified as ―pre-deferred‖ are
          expected to be accomplished during the upcoming week.
 186                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


           7.12.5.4.3. MSE will not be calculated for Cont/Exp units. It is anticipated that
           Cont/Exp unit require a great deal of flexibility to meet mission requirements.
   7.12.6. Cont/Exp organizations will not be responsible for Aircraft Generation Planning,
   Transfer Inspections, Flying Maintenance Planning Cycle, First Look, Annual/quarterly Mx
   Planning, AVDO and 2R1 functional management responsibilities.
   7.12.7. Contingency/expeditionary PS&D will develop procedures with homestation
   AVDOs to communicate and ensure AVDO responsibilities are performed.
7.13. (Added-AETC) Inspection Management. PS&D will identify, monitor, project, and
schedule aircraft inspection requirements into maintenance plans. EM will identify, monitor,
project, and schedule engine life limited component inspection requirements into maintenance
plans. Solid long-range plans with accurate inspection forecasting, limits aircraft downtime and
minimizes out-of-commission time.
   7.13.1. (Added-AETC) Inspection Recording:
       7.13.1.1. (Added-AETC) PS&D will load and monitor all aircraft scheduled and SI
       requirements in the MIS. PS&D will create a JST for each scheduled and SI requirement
       listed in applicable TOs.
       7.13.1.2. (Added-AETC) EM will load all engine inspection requirements listed in
       aircraft TOs and applicable engine TOs onto the JML.
       7.13.1.3. (Added-AETC) AGE         and   armament     schedulers   will   maintain   their
       appropriate JML.
       7.13.1.4. (Added-AETC) Inspection requirements with a frequency greater than 30
       days or 50 hours will be loaded by a JST into the MIS and included in all maintenance
       planning cycles. For those inspection requirements with a frequency equal to or less than
       30 days or 50 hours, determine locally if a JST is required. Inspection requirements not
       listed in the aircraft specific dash-6 TO will be loaded and tracked in the MIS regardless
       of the frequency.
       7.13.1.5. (Added-AETC) The inspection function will coordinate with PS&D or EM to
       ensure changes to inspection work cards are updated in the JML. For SIs accomplished
       on selected components and assemblies requiring entry on AFTO Form 95, work center
       supervisors will ensure the accuracy of MIS inputs prior to PS&D or EM processing the
       suspense validation.
   7.13.2. (Added-AETC) Inspection Scheduling. Input aircraft into inspection according to
   the + (plus) or – (minus) standards designated in the appropriate dash-6 TO.
   7.13.3. (Added-AETC) Inspection Requirements. Due to the type, variety, and frequency
   of scheduled and SIs, PS&D or EM must monitor, project, and schedule accomplishment
   while paying particular attention to aircraft returning from PDM. PS&D is the focal point for
   scheduled maintenance actions and is responsible for developing unit schedules that merge
   operational requirements and maintenance capabilities. Accurate schedules assist units in
   meeting UTE rates and maintaining mission capable (MC) rates.
   7.13.4. (Added-AETC) Forecasting and Preplanning Scheduled Inspections. At least 30
   days before the start month of an aircraft inspection and on a cycle equal to or greater than
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 187


   the HPO or home station check (HSC), PS&D will initiate an AF Form 2410, completing
   blocks 1 through 13 and 15 through 17 (EXCEPTION: KC-135 HSC). Use the following
   sequence of events to forecast and preplan scheduled inspections:
      7.13.4.1. (Added-AETC) PS&D will forward the AF Form 2410 to EM.
      7.13.4.2. (Added-AETC) EM will:
          7.13.4.2.1. (Added-AETC) Annotate all engine-related TCTOs, TCIs, inspections,
          or any major or minor maintenance action required during the aircraft’s scheduled
          downtime.
          7.13.4.2.2. (Added-AETC) Return the AF Form 2410 to PS&D after completion.
      7.13.4.3. (Added-AETC) PS&D will:
          7.13.4.3.1. (Added-AETC) Review all known aircraft TCTOs, TCIs, SIs, and
          delayed discrepancy data (planned or workable), and incorporate this data into the
          inspection work package.
          7.13.4.3.2. (Added-AETC) Identify known availability of parts and (or) kits
          required to complete scheduled actions on AF Form 2410.
7.14. (Added-AETC) Fleet Time Management:
   7.14.1. (Added-AETC) Goal. The goal of fleet time management is to ensure a balanced
   inspection dock flow that will support the AETC programmed allocation (PA) (the official
   flying hour allocation document) of flying hours without over or under tasking resources.
   Fleet time management is only applicable to aircraft using hourly-based phases or PE
   inspection programs. All aircraft can benefit by balancing the flying commitment across the
   entire fleet regardless of the inspection method.
      7.14.1.1. (Added-AETC) The keys to successful fleet time management are managing
      individual aircraft flying hours, ensuring a balanced mix of long and short duration
      inspections, and using realistic planning factors.
      7.14.1.2. (Added-AETC) Spreading and bunching flying hours between aircraft creates
      the potential for several aircraft to run out of inspection hours at close to the same time.
      This will cause a PE dock backlog or not having any aircraft with low enough PE hours
      remaining until inspection, leaving the dock empty for a period of time and causing the
      average fleet time to drop.
   7.14.2. (Added-AETC) Fleet time is the average number of flying hours per aircraft
   remaining until the next scheduled inspection. Plan the annual inspection dock flow to
   parallel the annual flying hour program as closely as possible, using the total PE or PH
   inspection required for the fiscal year.
      7.14.2.1. (Added-AETC) A prudent plan considers current fleet time posture and
      number of required inspections based on the flying hour program and the unit’s desired
      fleet time posture. Balance large month-to-month fluctuations in the annual flying hour
      program with inspection hours produced over a 2- or 3-month period to eliminate the
      accordion effect of spreading and bunching aircraft PE hours on the MIS TDI report.
 188                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


       7.14.2.2. (Added-AETC) Compute and report average fleet time according to AETCI
       21-105. Compute PE or PH inspections by dividing the PA flying hours by the inspection
       interval. To identify the total number of PE or PH inspections required for the coming
       year, take the annual PE or PH inspections required to support the PA flying hour
       program, plus or minus the inspections required to align the average fleet time at the
       beginning of the fiscal year with the AETC required minimum average.
7.15. (Added-AETC) Deferred Discrepancy Management:
   7.15.1. (Added-AETC) A deferred discrepancy is a minor discrepancy on an aircraft or
   item of aircraft equipment that cannot be corrected within 5 duty days. This includes non-life
   sustaining TCIs past their due date and overdue dash-6 TO inspections to include washes.
   Deferred discrepancies are separated into three distinct categories: awaiting maintenance
   (AWM), awaiting parts (AWP), and awaiting depot (AWD), as follows:
       7.15.1.1. (Added-AETC) AWM discrepancies are deferred discrepancies awaiting
       funds, manpower, facilities, or equipment. Schedule and correct AWM deferred
       discrepancies as soon as possible, but NLT the next PE, ISO, PH, or HSC (C-17 aircraft
       only) inspections, unless an extension is approved by the AMXS and MXS operations
       officer or CO for contract maintenance units. If further clarification is required to specify
       discrepancies that are AWM, make an entry in the discrepancy block in the MIS.
       7.15.1.2. (Added-AETC) AWP discrepancies are discrepancies deferred due to non-
       availability of assets. Establish a valid dueout date for all AWP discrepancies.
       7.15.1.3. (Added-AETC) AWD discrepancies are beyond unit capability and are
       deferred AWD input. Develop an AWD work center code in the MIS so AWD
       discrepancies are separated from AWM and AWP write ups, and are not counted in
       AWM and AWP rates.
   7.15.2. (Added-AETC) AWM Discrepancy Management. The owning flight or section will
   ensure all deferred discrepancies are input in the MIS and updated, completed, or scheduled
   through PS&D. If scheduled maintenance actions are not completed prior to the next
   scheduled flight or by the end of the 24-hour forecast period, the owning flight or section will
   reschedule the event. During ADRs, the owning flight or section will resolve any differences
   between the aircraft forms and the deferred listing.
   7.15.3. (Added-AETC) AWP Discrepancy Management. The performing flight or section
   will:
       7.15.3.1. (Added-AETC) Ensure a demand is made on supply for all assets needed to
       complete AWP deferred discrepancies and discrepancy data is input in the MIS.
       7.15.3.2. (Added-AETC) Ensure the supply data is loaded into the MIS by the MSL,
       forward asset support training (FAST), or authorized maintenance function.
       7.15.3.3. (Added-AETC) Ensure assets ordered have the same equipment identification
       designator (EID) as the original maintenance discrepancy.
7.16. (Added-AETC) Verification Procedures for CADs and PADs:
   7.16.1. (Added-AETC) CAD and PAD verification and validation will ensure the data
   recorded in the MIS corresponds with the items installed on the ejection seat, canopy, and
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                  189


  aircraft. An optional method of maintaining CAD and PAD verifications is to provide P&S
  and egress a shared drive where read-only, password-protected PRAs are posted. The focus
  of the CAD and PAD verification is to ensure the MIS is always correct.
  7.16.2. (Added-AETC) As a minimum, CAD and PAD components and harnesses installed
  on non-Advanced Concept Ejection Seat II (ACES II) egress systems will be validated
  during major PEs. Validate ACES II CAD and PAD components during the 36-month seat
  inspection. Limit verification of ACES II and non-ACES II CAD and PAD installed
  components to visually accessible items; however, the full extent of physical CAD and PAD
  inspections is left to the discretion of the respective egress section chief/foreman. The
  survival equipment function will perform drogue chute verifications during chute repacks. T-
  38 inertia reels do not require removal for the sole purpose of obtaining information from the
  rotary actuator.
  7.16.3. (AETC) Egress will correct any discrepancies discovered in the MIS during the
  verification procedures outlined in paragraph 7.16.4 (Added-AETC) – 7.16.8 (Added-
  AETC). Egress will request a current MIS egress-only PRA from the data base manager and
  provide PS&D a signed, verified, and updated copy of the PRA. Egress sections using
  IMDS-CDB may utilize screen 257, Egress Configuration Listing, in place of the PRA.
  7.16.4. (Added-AETC) Egress personnel will reconcile the data listed on their CAD and
  PAD verification sheet (extracted from the installed components) with the data listed on the
  existing PRA filed in the work center file. The minimum data requiring verification include
  the component part or serial number, lot number, position installed, date of manufacture, date
  of installation, date of expiration, egress indicator, and time change frequency listed in
  applicable 11A- or 11Pseries TOs.
  7.16.5. (Added-AETC) If the data matches (no errors or omissions are noted), egress will
  request an updated MIS egress-only PRA from the data base manager to ensure the accuracy
  of CAD and PAD components and harnesses recorded in the MIS. The egress technician or
  supervisor performing the verification will sign all copies of the current PRA and forward
  one copy to PS&D to file in the aircraft jacket file. File the original in the egress work center
  for subsequent verifications.
  7.16.6. (Added-AETC) If errors or omissions are noted before the aircraft’s next scheduled
  sortie, the egress technician or supervisor performing the verification will update the MIS to
  match what is actually installed. Annotate the correct data in red on the existing PRA and
  place the PRA in a suspense file. Request an updated MIS egress-only PRA, ensure the
  corrections have been made to the MIS, sign all copies, forward a copy to PS&D, and
  dispose of the suspense copy. Retain the original in the egress work center for subsequent
  verification.
  7.16.7. (Added-AETC) PS&D will review the corrected PRA for any TCI due dates that
  may change as a result of an incorrect data base. Current TCI forecasts will be for accuracy
  and an adjusted forecast submitted as required. PS&D will file the signed PRA in the aircraft
  historical record file.
  7.16.8. (Added-AETC) When egress components are replaced between major PEs, egress
  will update the existing PRA or equivalent online IMDS-CDB product (in red ink) with the
  new information and complete the event ID in the MIS creating a suspense for PS&D to
190                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


  clear. At a minimum, maintain this manually updated egress product until the next scheduled
  36-month inspection for ACES II seats, major PE, 2-year inspection, and acceptance
  inspection. At the next inspection cycle, request a current updated MIS egress-only product,
  ensure all red entries and updates have been made to the data base, sign all copies, forward a
  copy to PS&D, and dispose of the suspense copy. Retain the original in the Egress work
  center for subsequent verifications.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               191

                               QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA)

8.1. General. Maintenance quality and equipment reliability is the responsibility of all
maintenance personnel. The combined efforts of QA personnel, maintenance leaders, and
technicians are necessary to ensure high quality maintenance production and equipment
reliability. The QA staff evaluates the quality of maintenance accomplished and performs
necessary functions to manage the wing/group’s Maintenance Standardization Evaluation
Program (MSEP). The MSEP provides an objective sampling of the quality of equipment, the
proficiency of maintenance personnel, and the compliance of Lead Command and Unit MSEP
focus areas, programs, and processes. QA personnel are not an extension of the work force and
shall not be tasked to perform production inspections. QA serves as the primary technical
advisory agency in the maintenance organization, assisting maintenance supervision at all levels
to resolve quality problems. The evaluation and analysis of deficiencies and problem areas are
key functions of QA that highlight and identify underlying causes of poor quality in the
maintenance production effort. Aircraft and equipment condition and personnel proficiency are
validated through the MSEP and shall be recorded using a Lead Command-approved QA
database. Civil service and contracted organizations to include MEO/HPO shall follow the
requirements established in their respective contract and accepted quality program.
8.1. (AETC) General. Units are authorized to use a QA data base of their choice providing the
data base meets the minimum requirements of AFI 21-101, paragraph 8.11.

inspection at least every 2 years (not applicable to contractor or civil service units).
8.10. Maintenance Standardization and Evaluation Program (MSEP). The MSEP is the
Maintenance component of the Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP) and is
designed to provide unit maintenance managers with a method of evaluating compliance with
AF, Lead Command and local maintenance directives and policies. The LCAP, AFI 20-111,
Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP), is the Air Force evaluation program that
establishes the Lead Command Logistics Compliance Assessment Team (LCAT). Its purpose is
to provide a HHQ validation of maintenance organization compliance with AF, Lead Command
and unit directives.
   8.10.1. Unit Responsibilities . Units are responsible for developing their MSEP and
   conducting local inspections to ensure their programs, processes, maintenance technician
   proficiency, equipment condition and other focus areas are in compliance with AF, Lead
   Command and local directives.
   8.10.2. Types of MSEP Evaluations and Inspections. The following types of evaluations,
   inspections and observations support the MSEP: PEs, QVIs, SIs, MIs, DSVs, TDVs, UCRs
   (see para 8.10.13-17 for explanations of each) and when directed, other inspections. These
   inspection terms may differ based on Lead Command-approved QA databases.
   8.10.3. Applicability to Contract Maintenance Activities. The unit level MSEP is not
   applicable to contract maintenance activities unless required by the SOW/PWS/PRS/contract.
   8.10.4. Executing the Unit MSEP. The MSEP is executed by QA, which permits the
   MXG/CC to focus the unit program on problem areas where improvements are needed. Units
   may develop a local system to track inspection reports until closed.
   8.10.5. Unit MSEP Evaluation Criteria. Units will use AF-Level Functional Checklists, Lead
   Command supplements and local supplements if applicable. For evaluations of technician
   proficiency and equipment condition, applicable technical data is the evaluation standard.
   Local directives will also be used.
   8.10.5. (AETC) Standard functional checklists are available at the following url:
   https://eis.aetc.af.mil/hq/A47/A4M/A4MM/A4MMP/MAJCOM%20CHECKLIST/For
   ms/AllItems.aspx.
   8.10.6. Unit MSEP Grading. Units must grade their MSEP evaluations using objective
   ratings (Outstanding, Excellent, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory). The unit MSEP
   shall publish a final report of findings, problem areas, and recommended improvements (as
   required), from the evaluation for distribution to MXG/CC and all inspected organizations
   monthly.
       8.10.6.1. Inspections and evaluations performed (e.g., PE, SI, QVI) will be rated
       ―PASS/FAIL‖. Exception: see AFI 21-204 for additional information on Nuclear
       Weapons PE’s and certification program.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                197


     8.10.6.2. Units will use the following five tier rating system:
         8.10.6.2.1. Outstanding 95-100%
         8.10.6.2.2. Excellent 90-94.99%
         8.10.6.2.3. Satisfactory 80-89.99%
         8.10.6.2.4. Marginal 70-79.99%
         8.10.6.2.5. Unsatisfactory 0-69.99%
     8.10.6.3. Ratings are calculated by dividing the total number of inspections passed by
     total completed. For example, QA inspects 10 aircraft preflights with the following
     results: 9 ―passes‖ and 1 ―failure‖. Divide the total ―passes‖ by the total inspections
     (9/10=0.90) 90 percent for an ―Excellent‖ rating.
         8.10.6.3.1. Deduct 0.5 percentage points for each TDV, DSV, and UCR from overall
         percentage grades except at Group level. For example, a squadron earns an overall
         rating of 90 percent, ―Excellent‖. However, QA observed 4 TDVs and 3 DSVs. The
         sum of the TDVs and DSVs is 7, (4+3=7). Multiply the sum (7) by 0.5, (7x0.5=3.5)
         and subtract the product (3.5) from the original 90 percent, (90-3.5=86.5). The
         adjusted total is 86.5 percent; therefore, the squadron is rated ―Satisfactory‖.
  8.10.7. The results of the total number of inspections accomplished will be rolled up to
  create a cumulative rating by flight and squadron. Group totals will be reflected as an average
  of squadron totals.
  8.10.8. Unit MSEP Focus Areas. The purpose of the MSEP is to measure how well units
  meet or exceed standards. QA shall assess how well units are meeting compliance goals and
  look for areas of opportunity for improvement. The results of the evaluations and inspections
  are organized into a summary, in addition to the focus areas listed in AFI 20-111 the
  following areas must be addressed:
     8.10.8.1. Compliance with and currency of TOs and directives. Personnel at all levels are
     responsible and accountable for enforcing this mandatory standard. Ensure all applicable
     TOs and directives are complete, current and used.
     8.10.8.2. Aircraft and equipment forms documentation. Ensure forms used to document
     any maintenance related action for aircraft or equipment are documented according to 00-
     20 series TOs, specific equipment TO requirements and applicable command directives
     and supplements.
     8.10.8.3. Aircraft and Equipment Inspections. Inspect aircraft and equipment (including

      8.10.8.7. Key Task List (KTL). The KTL is an AF, Lead Command or Unit developed
      list of required inspections. The KTL must cover tasks that are complex and those
      affecting safety of flight. All maintenance actions/functions listed on the KTL require
      mandatory call-in to QA each time the maintenance action/function is accomplished. QA
      evaluators will respond and perform an evaluation, but on a limited basis may waive the
      inspection. QA must review and update the list at least every 2 years to ensure it
      encompasses those maintenance actions/functions directly affecting quality of
      maintenance. Lead Commands may identify minimum KTLs for each MDS.
      8.10.8.7. (AETC) QA will develop the key task list (KTL) with inputs from the
      Operations Officer/MX SUPT. The MXG/CC will approve the KTL.
      8.10.8.8. Routine Inspection List (RIL). The RIL is an AF, Lead Command or Unit
      developed list of routine inspections that must be performed. Frequency is determined by
      MXG/CC. QA shall consolidate Operations Officer/MX SUPT inputs/suggested changes
      and obtain MXG/CC approval. Additional requirements for nuclear capable units are
      located in AFI 21-204. Tasks shall not be removed from the RIL without issuing
      authorities approval (i.e. AF, Lead Command, MXG/CC). The RIL must contain the
      following if applicable to the unit:
      8.10.8.8. (AETC) The MXG/CC will identify additional routine inspection list (RIL)
      actions and tasks as necessary.

         8.10.8.8.18. Aircraft corrosion inspections.
         8.10.8.8.19. Equipment washes
         8.10.8.8.20. Equipment corrosion inspections.
         8.10.8.8.21. Environmental compliance
         8.10.8.8.22. NWRM Accountability and forms documentation
     8.10.8.9. QA must coordinate with Munitions Activity to ensure all required inspections
     are performed IAW AFI 21-200 series publications. Additionally, QA, in coordination
     with the Munitions Flt CC/Chief (or Operations Officer/ MX SUPT in a MUNS), must
     develop quarterly standards for the following areas:
         8.10.8.9.1. Munitions accountability.
         8.10.8.9.2. Munitions storage practices, security and safety.
         8.10.8.9.3. Munitions inspections.
         8.10.8.9.4. Munitions materiel handling and test equipment.
         8.10.8.9.5. Munitions stockpile management.
         8.10.8.9.6. Tactical missiles records system.
         8.10.8.9.7. Munitions infrastructure (e.g., adequacy of lightning protection and
         grounding systems, bonding of facility doors, adequate power conversion equipment).
         8.10.8.9.8. Munitions training programs.
  8.10.9. Unit MSEP Evaluation and Inspection Plan. QA develops an evaluation and
  inspection plan showing areas, types and numbers of inspections and evaluations that must be
  conducted. The inspection plan will be coordinated through each squadron MOO/Supt. When
  developing the plan, QA OIC/SUPT (MXW QA Chief) will:
     8.10.9.1. Address areas of concern identified by maintenance managers and the WWM.
     8.10.9.2. Tailor the plan for each squadron, flight or section.
     8.10.9.3. Review, formalize and distribute the inspection or evaluation plan.
  8.10.10. Discrepancy Categories. (ALC use different terms based on MIS)
     8.10.10.1. Category I (CAT I). A required inspection/TO procedural item missed or
     improperly completed. This category is a specific work card item or TO step, Note,
     caution or warning for a specific condition or action. Use sub-classifications of major or
     minor to indicate the discrepancy’s relative severity.
     8.10.10.2. Category II (CAT II). An obvious defect, which could have been readily
     detected by a technician or supervisor, but is not a specific work card item or TO step,
     Note, caution or warning for that specific evaluated task. Use sub-classification of major
     or minor to indicate the discrepancy’s relative severity.
  8.10.11. Definitions of major and minor.
     8.10.11.1. A major finding is defined as a condition that would endanger personnel,
     jeopardize equipment or system reliability, impact safety of flight or warrant
200                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


      discontinuing the process or equipment operation. Any Major discrepancy will result in
      an automatic inspection failure. Note: The inspector can/should declare a major finding
      when one additional action ―would‖ result in one of the following; endanger personnel,
      jeopardize equipment or system reliability, impact safety of flight or warrant
      discontinuing the process or equipment operation. To clarify the inspector should
      intercede to prevent one of the above occurrences from happening but may still write up a
      major finding even though the jeopardizing action was never taken due to their
      intercession.
      8.10.11.2. A minor finding is defined as an unsatisfactory condition that requires repair
      or correction, but does not endanger personnel, impact safety of flight, jeopardize
      equipment reliability or warrant discontinuing a process or equipment operation. CAT II
      minors shall be documented for trends, but must not be counted against the AQL. Note:
      FO contained in tool kits or found in cargo areas of aircraft which pose no FOD threat are
      classified as a minor finding since it would require more than one additional action to
      meet the definition of a major finding.
  8.10.12. Discrepancy Reporting. Report the discrepancy to the applicable work centers. QA
  must provide a reference for identified discrepancies using work cards, job guides, WUC
  manuals, checklists, AFOSHSTDs, TOs, and other directives.
  8.10.13. Detected Safety Violations, Technical Data Violations, and Unsatisfactory
  Condition Reports (DSV, TDV and UCR). This category represents observed events or
  conditions with safety implications or technical violations not related to an inspection or
  evaluation and are considered unsafe, not IAW established procedures, or in the case of
  equipment, unfit to operate. The Lead Command-approved QA database will be used to
  document any of the following conditions:
      8.10.13.1. DSV. An unsafe act by an individual. The inspector must stop the unsafe act
      immediately. Do not document a separate DSV on an individual undergoing a personnel
      evaluation since the unsafe act automatically results in a "Fail" rating on the PE. Use the
      word "Safety" when a safety violation is committed during a PE.
      8.10.13.2. TDV. An observation of any person performing maintenance without the
      proper technical data available, available but not in use or not following the correct
      sequence of steps (if directed). The technician must have knowledge of all general
      directives associated with the job prior to performing the task. However, those directives
      need not be present at the job site. Do not document a separate TDV on an individual
      undergoing a PE, since failure to use technical data automatically results in a "Fail"
      rating.
      8.10.13.3. UCR. An unsafe or unsatisfactory condition, other than a DSV, chargeable to
      the work center supervisor. UCRs will be documented even when it is not possible to
      determine who created the condition.
  8.10.14. Personnel Evaluations (PE). A PE is an over-the-shoulder (direct) evaluation of a
  maintenance action or inspection by an individual or team. Use PEs to evaluate job
  proficiency, degree of training and compliance with technical data. Individuals performing,
  supervising or evaluating maintenance tasks are subject to a PE. Rate PEs ―Pass‖ or ―Fail‖
  based on established AQLs/standards. Document the PE in the Lead Command-approved
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 201


  database. Ensure a PE is accomplished on all technicians that perform maintenance. Lead
  Commands will determine the frequency of PEs.
  8.10.14. (AETC) Personnel Evaluations (PE) will be accomplished on an 18-month cycle
  (not applicable for contract or MEO/civil service organizations). NDI PEs are applicable to
  all organizations and will be conducted IAW AFI 21-101, paragraph 8.10.14.1.3.
     8.10.14.1. Performing a PE. When performing a PE, the QA inspector briefs the
     individual or team on the evaluation and how it will be rated. QA inspector will
     determine what task will be evaluated. This will not drive additional work loads. The PE
     will include an evaluation of, the individual’s training records, SCR(if task requires), tool
     box, TMDE and TOs. The evaluation starts when the individual or team begins the task,
     or portion of the task to be evaluated, and is completed when the job or previously
     determined portion of the task is finished. Provide feedback to the individual or team and
     supervision upon completion. The types of PEs are:
         8.10.14.1.1. Individual Evaluations. This is a QA over-the-shoulder (direct)
         evaluation of a technician or supervisor performing a job. PEs may be performed on
         individuals working alone or as part of a team.
         8.10.14.1.2. Team Evaluations. This is a QA over-the-shoulder (direct) evaluation of
         technicians and supervisors performing a team task. A team task is one requiring
         more than one person to complete the task (i.e. refueling, ECM pod up/down loading,
         bomb build-up, towing, weapons maintenance, pylon installation). Evaluations must
         accurately assess the proficiency of each individual under evaluation. Refer to AFI
         21-204 for nuclear weapons maintenance and handling evaluations.
         8.10.14.1.3. QA will conduct PE’s on each NDI technician, for each NDI method
         annually (Reservisit will be every 2-years, 18 months for full-time Guardsmen and 36
         months for Drill Status Guardsmen), to ensure effective trending on NDI methods.
     8.10.14.2. Rating Personnel Evaluations. QA rates each evaluation based on
     AQLs/standards (see paragraph 8.10.18 for AQL definitions/standards). The rating
     applies only to the specific task evaluated and not to other tasks that a technician or
     supervisor is qualified to perform. Upon completion of a failed evaluation, the evaluator
     must provide on-the-spot feedback. Determine ratings as follows:
         8.10.14.2.1. Pass: Number of discrepancies does not exceed AQL/standards.
         8.10.14.2.2. Fail: An evaluation that results in any of the following:
            8.10.14.2.2.1. Number of discrepancies exceeds the established AQL/standards.
            8.10.14.2.2.2. A technician fails to detect a major discrepancy while complying
            with an inspection or TO requirement.
            8.10.14.2.2.3. A technician fails to comply with a technical data step that could
            affect the performance of the equipment involved or cause injury to personnel. Do
            not document a separate Technical Data Violation (TDV) on an individual
            undergoing a PE, since failure to use technical data automatically results in a
            ―Fail‖ rating.
            8.10.14.2.2.4. A technician demonstrates a lack of technical proficiency or
202                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


             system knowledge.
             8.10.14.2.2.5. Training/certification not documented.
             8.10.14.2.2.6. A technician commits a safety violation. Use the word ―Safety‖
             when a safety violation is committed during a PE. Do not document a separate
             Detected Safety Violation (DSV) on an individual undergoing a personnel
             evaluation since the unsafe act automatically results in a ―Fail‖ rating on the PE.
             See definition of DSV in this chapter.
             8.10.14.2.2.7. A technician fails to document maintenance actions in appropriate
             equipment records.
             8.10.14.2.2.8. For nuclear weapons maintenance, an unsatisfactory rating must be
             given when any of the deficiencies or applicable unsatisfactory conditions in TO
             11N-25-1, Nuclear Weapon Technical Inspections, or AFI 21-204 exist.
  8.10.15. Quality Verification Inspections (QVI). A QVI is an inspection of equipment
  condition, or a maintenance process, an assessment following a maintenance inspection,
  servicing or repair action, or verification that a technician or supervisor properly completed
  an inspection or repair action. QVIs shall not be conducted after equipment operation when
  such operation could invalidate indications of proper job accomplishment. Limit QVIs to the
  same inspection card deck or technical data required for the job. This inspection does not
  require disassembling parts, removing stress panels or like actions. A QVI for required Dash-
  6 TO inspections may be accomplished by checking a portion of the required card or area.
  The QVI report should reflect deficiencies by the individual who accomplished the task and
  identify specific discrepancies. Document discrepancies in active equipment records and
  forms (i.e., AFTO Form/IMT 781A, AFTO IMT 244 and AF IMT 2420, Quality Assurance
  Inspection Summary for ALCs, AFMC IMT 343, Quality Assurance Assessment or in the
  Quality Information Management Standard System (QIMSS)).
      8.10.15.1. Rating QVIs. Rate QVIs ―pass‖ or ―fail‖ by comparing the number of
      discrepancies with the established AQLs/standards.
         8.10.15.1.1. Pass:   Number     of   discrepancies    does    not   exceed    established
         AQL/standard.
         8.10.15.1.2. Fail: An inspection that results in any of the following:
             8.10.15.1.2.1. A technician fails to detect a major discrepancy while complying
             with an inspection or TO requirement.
             8.10.15.1.2.2. Number of CAT I minor discrepancies exceeds the established
             AQL/standard.
             8.10.15.1.2.3. A technician is not signed off in training records as task qualified.
         8.10.15.1.3. Document the QVI in the Lead Command-approved QA database. Each
         QVI is chargeable to the technician or supervisor who signed off/cleared the
         ―corrected by‖ block or ―inspected by‖ block of the applicable maintenance form or
         equipment record. When evaluating the technician who signed off the ―inspected by‖
         block, evaluate only the items normally verified by signing off the ―Red-X‖. Only
         one evaluation shall be scored for each inspection.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                203


  8.10.16. Special Inspections (SI). SIs are inspections not covered by QVIs, PEs or MIs. SIs
  may include, but are not limited to, aircraft and equipment forms inspections, document file
  inspections, CTKs, TO files, vehicle inspections, housekeeping, safety practices, FOD
  Program, etc. SIs may be condition, procedural or compliance oriented. The Lead Command-
  approved QA database will be used to document special inspections. SIs can be non-rated. If
  rating a SI, rate as ―Pass‖ or ―Fail‖ based on established AQLs/standards.
  8.10.16. (AETC) Do not correct discrepancies discovered during document file inspections
  unless they are of a historical nature.
  8.10.17. Management Inspection (MI). Perform these inspections to follow-up on trends,
  conduct investigations or conduct research to get to the root cause of problems. GP/CC,
  SQ/CC or work center supervisors may request MIs. MIs may encompass PE/QVI trends and
  other inspection data; NMC causes; aborts and trends; in-flight emergency trends; high
  component or system failure rates; suspected training deficiencies, and tasks outlined in
  aircraft Dash-6 TOs. Report MI results to the requester. MIs can be non-rated and may be
  counted in QA trends. The Lead Command-approved QA database will be used to document
  management inspections.
  8.10.18. Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL). An AQL deNotes the maximum allowable
  number of minor findings that a process or product may be charged for the task to be rated
  ―Pass.‖ It must be strict enough that the task, process or product meets an acceptable level of
  quality, but isn’t so strict that a ―pass‖ rating is unattainable. The AQL is derived/revised
  from QA performance-based data.
     8.10.18.1. Lead Commands may develop standardized AQLs by weapon system and
     establish procedures to review at least annually.
     8.10.18.1. (AETC) The MXG/CC will determine and approve AQLs and ensure they
     are reviewed annually.
     8.10.18.2. GP/CCs will establish AQLs for tasks/inspections not included on the Lead
     Command AQL.
     8.10.18.3. AQLs/baselines for nuclear maintenance, cruise missile maintenance and
     nuclear weapons handling tasks are defined in AFI 21-204.
     8.10.18.4. AQLs will be published in the unit’s evaluation and inspection plan IAW para
     8.10.9.
  8.10.19. Monthly Summary (quarterly for the ARC). The MSEP summary advises the
  WG/CC and GP/ CCs of the quality of maintenance. The monthly summary shall be
  published and distributed to the WG/CC, GP/CC and appropriate activities in the
  maintenance complex. To ensure the greatest visibility possible for MSEP summaries,
  classified parts must be published separately from the main summary. Compile the summary
  from inspection data and load crew evaluation statistics (provided by WS). The MSEP
  summary will include visual information, graphs, narratives, quality trends identified through
  inspections and evaluations, discussion of common problem areas and descriptions of
  successful programs or initiatives. The following areas must be addressed in the summary:
     8.10.19.1. Compliance with and currency of TOs and directives to include unit.
     8.10.19.2. Aircraft and equipment forms documentation.
 204                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


       8.10.19.3. Compliance and Management of Safety, Environmental, Housekeeping, and
       FOD Programs.
       8.10.19.4. Training Program.
       8.10.19.5. Key Task List (KTL).
       8.10.19.6. Routine Inspection List (RIL).
       8.10.19.7. Munitions Program.
       8.10.19.8. High-missed carded items.
          8.10.19.8.1. A high-missed carded item is defined as any work card item missed at
          least three times during a one-month period. Units should use the high-missed carded
          items to enhance maintenance-training programs, detect trends and improve the
          quality of maintenance. MMA will review items to identify any relationships with
          repeat, recur and CND trends.
       8.10.19.9. Narrative Report: The monthly narrative report must contain an analysis of the
       MSEP results, a summary of significant CAT I and II discrepancies, technical inspections
       and recommendations for improvement. Prior to preparing the narrative report, QA must
       conduct a study of trends.
       8.10.19.10. Trend Analysis. Review previous reports to determine if inspected areas
       have improved or declined. Consistent high scores in any category may indicate the
       programs emphasis is not focused on the unit’s actual problem areas. Low scoring areas
       may require a reassessment of the corrective actions taken by management. Continuous
       communication between MMA, unit leadership, maintenance supervision, and QA
       personnel is essential. Highlight trends and root causes in the summary.
   8.10.20. MSEP Meetings. The GP/unit must conduct quarterly meetings to review MSEP
   data. The MXW/MXG/CC shall chair the meeting. Attendees must include, as a minimum,
   SQ/CCs, MOO/MX SUPTs, WWMs, Chief Inspector, and senior analysts.
8.11. Lead Command-approved QA database. Units will use their Lead Command approved
data base to capture MSEP data. Lead Commands will ensure the data fields contained in the
database include:
   8.11.1. Work center: Input the shop code whose process was inspected.
   8.11.2. Inspector: Enter the employee number of the inspector.
   8.11.3. Employee: Enter the employee number or equivalent of the person inspected.

   8.11.14. Remarks: The narrative of inspector findings.
8.12. QA Product Improvement Programs (PIP). The MXG QA runs PIP for the
maintenance complex (ALC MXW/CC will assign PIP management responsibilities). QA must
establish/appoint the following:
   8.12.1. Product Improvement Program (PIP). Combined with daily maintenance data
   reporting, the PIP provides an effective means to improve the R&M and support PIWG of
   aircraft and equipment. PIP includes the following programs:
      8.12.1.1. Deficiency Reporting.
      8.12.1.2. AFTO IMT 22.
      8.12.1.3. Source, Maintenance, Recoverability (SMR) change code request.
      8.12.1.4. R&M as applicable.
      8.12.1.5. Configuration Management Program; AF IMT 1067 and TCTOs.
   8.12.2. Product Improvement Manager (PIM). The MXW/MXG CC will assign Product
   Improvement Manager (PIM) duties within their organizations. The PIM promotes
   deficiency reporting and provides a sound PIP based on inputs from maintenance activities.
   The PIM emphasizes and promotes product improvement and ensures maintenance personnel
   are familiar with them by circulating flyers/newsletters, visiting commander’s calls,
   presenting the program at maintenance orientation briefings and making routine visits to
   maintenance areas.

         appropriate precedence and category.
         8.12.2.1.6. Screen reported deficiencies for possible unit-unique contributing factors.
         Initiate management action on unsatisfactory conditions resulting from local
         procedures or a lack of technical capability.
         8.12.2.1.7. Perform/coordinate a technical review of DRs returned to the unit without
         an adequate response. Determine whether to resubmit with additional information.
         8.12.2.1.8. Perform exhibit-processing oversight by coordinating with the ALC and
         the LRS to ensure proper exhibit control and handling.
      8.12.2.2. Technical Order Improvement Program (AFTO IMT 22). The PIM will:
         8.12.2.2.1. Ensure proper evaluation is performed and forms are properly filled out
         and processed IAW TO 00-5-1. Note: WS reviews and approves all AFTO IMT 22
         for weapons loading TOs. WS must fill in Block 9 and indicate
         ―Approval‖/―Disapproval‖ in Block 1.
         8.12.2.2.2. Ensure control numbers are assigned and forward all AFTO IMT 22s via
         e-mail transmission or Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition Logistics Support (JCALS)
         to the appropriate action agency.
         8.12.2.2.3. Maintain an AFTO IMT 22 suspense file. Note: An Approved AFTO
         Form 22 does not provide authority to deviate from current TO procedures. TO
         changes must be posted to implement approved AFTO IMT 22s.
         8.12.2.2.4. Conduct a technical review of disapproved AFTO IMT 22 to determine
         whether to resubmit with additional information. Consider for submission to technical
         working groups (e.g., PIWG, MDS maintainer’s conferences). Dispose of
         disapproved AFTO IMT 22 IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule located at
         https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
      8.12.2.3. Source, Maintenance, and Recoverability Code (SMR) change request. The
      AFTO 22 process must be used to submit an SMR change request. The PIM will:
         8.12.2.3.1. Track the status of SMR change requests.
         8.12.2.3.2. Conduct a technical review of SMR change requests returned from depots
         and item managers with an unsatisfactory answer to determine whether to resubmit
         with additional information. Consider for submission to technical working groups
         (e.g., PIWG, MDS maintainer’s conferences).
         8.12.2.3.3. Coordinate repair evaluation meetings when approved SMR change
         requests affect several agencies.
         8.12.2.3.4. Serve as focal point for base level repair and manufacturing capability.
      8.12.2.4. Reliability and Maintainability (R&M). At the core of R&M efforts are
      technical working groups (e.g., PIWG, MDS maintainers’ conferences). Assessing unit
      R&M concerns involves several processes. The PIM will:
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                207


          8.12.2.4.1. Forward inputs IAW AFI 21-118.
          8.12.2.4.2. Review all reported R&M deficiencies and determine those caused by
          unit factors and local conditions versus those beyond the unit's control.
          8.12.2.4.3. Review available maintenance and supply trends and high work hour
          consuming repairs. Analysis provides the majority of this information.
          8.12.2.4.4. Consolidate R&M deficiency reports/functional area reports for each
          system (e.g., AGE, weapons, PMEL, avionics, engines, commodities and airframe)
          and prioritize proposed items for a particular system IAW weighted factors in AFI
          21-118.
          8.12.2.4.5. Conduct R&M working group meetings with supervisors and technicians
          when it is determined beneficial to ensure quality inputs to technical working groups.
          Note: Meeting will be chaired by the MXG/CC.
          8.12.2.4.6. Distribute technical working group minutes and ALC corrective actions to
          appropriate base agencies.
          8.12.2.4.7. Maintain a file for all R&M deficiencies (non-quality) but not meeting the
          criteria for submission to AFMC. If required, these deficiencies are tracked for future
          PIWG action on a product improvement worksheet IAW AFI 21-118.
          8.12.2.4.8. (Added-AETC) Maintain a product improvement working group
          (PIWG) file, if applicable, to include a locally devised logbook, ledger, or computer
          program to record agenda items, meeting minutes, PIWG agenda input reports, and
          MAJCOM correspondence. The product improvement manager (PIM) will:
             8.12.2.4.8.1. (Added-AETC) Develop a PIWG input report for each system
             (such as AGE, PMEL, avionics, engines, and commodities) and the primary
             weapon system that has an established PIWG.
             8.12.2.4.8.2. (Added-AETC) Conduct unit-level PIWG meetings with
             supervisors, technicians, and QAEs when these meetings are determined to be
             beneficial to ensuring quality inputs to PIWGs or when ideas are solicited to
             enhance product improvement. (Note: The PIM will chair these meetings, prepare
             an agenda, keep meeting minutes, and forward a copy of the minutes to the
             appropriate unit agencies and HQ AETC/A4M within 45 days of the meeting.)
             8.12.2.4.8.3. (Added-AETC) Forward agenda items to HQ AETC/A4M on
             request.
             8.12.2.4.8.4. (Added-AETC) List items requiring out-of-cycle input to HQ
             AETC/A4M. Submitted agenda items must include item nomenclature, WUC,
             part number, NSN, defect or improvement statement, reason for submission
             (including number of failures, man-hours consumed, and estimated costs to repair
             or the cost if left uncorrected), and recommended actions.
8.13. Configuration Management (CM) and Modification Management. QA is responsible
for CM and Modification management. This includes reviewing, submitting and tracking unit
modification proposals being worked by Lead Commands and ensuring proper implementation
 208                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


of approved modification instructions or TCTOs. Follow procedures outlined in Chapter 7 of this
instruction for specific QA responsibilities in the TCTO process.
   8.13.1. QA reviews TCTOs, OTIs and command modifications to determine their
   applicability to unit maintained equipment, notifies the MOC, monitors expended man-hours
   consumption and the quality of unit compliance actions. Munitions and special weapons
   TCTOs are reviewed by their respective sections.
   8.13.2. QA ensures command-directed modifications are documented in the same manner as
   TCTOs. QA must maintain a copy of command modification instructions on file until they
   are formally rescinded or removed from the equipment.
8.14. Technical Order Distribution Office (TODO). The TODO ensures TOs are managed
IAW AFPD 21-3, AFI 63-101 and TO 00-5-1. Establish the PMEL TODO under the control of
the TMDE Flight. TO 00-5-1 provides criteria for establishing levels of TO distribution
activities. Additionally, TODO offices shall control electronic technical data configuration IAW
Chapter 10 of this instruction. TODO will.
   8.14.1. Coordinate with QA subject matter expert (SME) (or production planning team and
   QA representative for ALC) for each incoming TCTO to determine applicability. Note: All
   TCTOs received from outside agencies must be routed through QA for the review process.
       8.14.1.1. Determine TCTO applicability by aircraft serial number for aircraft, engine
       serial number for engines, and by part number or other specific criteria for commodities.
       8.14.1.2. Date stamp TCTOs to reflect the date the hard copy is received. Date stamping
       all TCTOs with the date received indicates QA has reviewed the TCTO and that it is
       applicable. Only date stamped TCTOs are authorized for use. Note: The compliance
       period start date for an inspection TCTO is upon receipt of the TCTO itself and it must be
       completed entirely within the stated time frame or the affected system/equipment must be
       removed from service.
       8.14.1.3. Provide copies of the TCTO to the work centers doing the work. Mark these
       TCTOs as ―working copy/destroy when complete‖. Do not place these working copies in
       a formal TO file.
       8.14.1.4. Provide a file copy of the TCTO to PS&D or weapon system support center for
       ALC.
       8.14.1.5. Ensure personnel assigned as a TODO/Technical Order Distribution Account
       (TODA) managers meet requirements set forth in TO 00-5-1, AFI 63-101 and applicable
       directives.
   8.14.2. Manage the QA Central TO File. As a minimum, the QA file must contain copies
   (paper copies for paper-only TOs or local access to digital TOs) of general and procedural
   TOs and copies of all TCTOs pertaining to the equipment owned, operated or maintained by
   the GP/CC. The file is kept to meet QA requirements, not to duplicate TOs held by
   maintenance work centers.
   8.14.3. Manage TO accounts IAW TO 00-5-1. In addition to its designed purpose as
   established in TO 00-5-1, Enhanced Technical Information Management Systems (ETIMS)
   serves as a locator for maintenance TOs. Updates are based on information from squadron
   TODA requisitions.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                              209


  8.14.4. TODOs must use ETIMS to establish and maintain records for all TO accounts IAW
  TO 00-5-1.
  8.14.5. Local Work Cards, Job Guides, Page Supplements and Checklists. Limit use of local
  work cards (LWC), local job guides (LJG), local page supplements (LPS) or local checklists
  (LCL) to accomplish maintenance on AF equipment. Locally prepared technical instructions
  must not be used to circumvent AFMCs inherent responsibility for technical data (see TO 00-
  5-1). The TODO must review and manage all locally developed products IAW TO 00-5-1
  and Lead Command supplements for safety and adequacy of procedures. Ensure LWCs,
  LJGs, LPSs and LCLs are reviewed for currency when source reference data changes.
  Develop OIs to comply with these policies.
  8.14.5. (AETC) Ensure all locally developed work cards, job guides, page supplements, and
  checklists are reviewed and validated by QA/QC and approved by the MXG/CC or
  functional director (or commander and QAE). Distribute approved work cards, job guides,
  page supplements, and checklists to all applicable maintenance activities. When TOs have
  not been published for equipment assigned to the maintenance complex, QA or the
  maintenance function where maintenance is actually done may set up a file of commercial
  off-the-shelf (COTS) manuals or publications relating to this equipment (TO 00-5-1, AF
  Technical Order System). This file must be collocated with the TO file.
  8.14.6. TO Change Notification. The TODO must prepare a list of all changes and revisions
  to indexes, TOs, inspection work cards and checklists. This list must include TO number and
  date received. This list must be included in the wing’s weekly maintenance plan and flying
  schedule or electronically linked. Supervisors must review the list of changes and ensure all
  personnel are aware a change or revision has been received. Additionally, ―Immediate‖
  action TCTOs must be dealt with upon receipt, and ―Urgent Action‖ TCTOs, safety
  supplements and interim supplements must be brought to the attention of supervisors within
  24 hours of receipt.
  8.14.7. TO File Inspections. The QA TODO shall inspect other maintenance
  TODOs/TODAs in the maintenance complex at least annually along with performing spot
  checks of TO files. As a minimum, the TODO will develop an inspection checklist or use the
  ―TODO and TO Account Checklist‖ provided in TO 00-5-1. As part of this inspection, the
  TODO should evaluate and ensure whether the TODO/TODA has received the proper
  training.
  8.14.8. TODOs must effectively control the electronic data configuration on applicable E-
  Tools IAW Chapter 10 of this instruction.
  8.14.9. TODOs shall maintain records of Automated Computer Program Identification
  Number System (ACPINS) using TOs 00-5-1, 00-5-16, and 00-5-17. TODOs shall set up
  software sub-accounts with each appropriate shop/section and ensure each shop/section has
  the most current software on hand. Additionally, TODOs shall include ACPINs in the routine
  and annual checks required by TO 00-5-1. Note: TODO will have access to Authorized
  Software Configuration Matrix (ASCM) to ensure assigned CV-22 units have the most
  current software.

8.15. One-Time Inspections (OTI) program. The OTI program will be managed by the MXG
IAW TO 00-20-1. OTIs are normally look-only actions to verify the existence of suspected
equipment conditions or malfunctions.
8.16. Functional Check Flights (FCFs) to include Operational Check Flights (OCFs).
   8.16.1. Check Flights are performed to ensure an aircraft is airworthy and/or capable of
   accomplishing its mission. FCFs are not normally flown when the airworthiness of the
   aircraft can be determined by maintenance operational checks prescribed by a technical
   directive. Additional guidance may be found in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management; AFI 11-
   202V3, General Flight Rules; AFI 13-201, AF Airspace Management; TO 1-1-300,
   Acceptance/Functional Check Flight and Maintenance Operational Checks; TO 00-20-1; and
   applicable Dash-6 and Dash-1 TOs. The OG/CC is responsible for appointing an FCF OIC.
       8.16.1.1. OCFs must be kept to a minimum and are not used to replace Dash-6 FCF
       requirements. OCFs must be flown by experienced aircrews (not required to be an FCF
       qualified aircrew), must be briefed by QA for aircraft condition, and accomplished
       following the same maintenance criteria as FCFs.
       8.16.1.1. (VANCEAFB) REQUIREMENTS for OCFs:
          8.16.1.1.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) FCF pilots will accomplish all OCFs. The first
          flight on T-38 aircraft will be local and include a rated pilot when maintenance
          actions listed below are:
          8.16.1.1.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Anytime a moveable flight control surface has
          been replaced and/or removed and reinstalled for major repairs.
          8.16.1.1.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) When flight control cables or rods have been
          rerouted, rigged, or flight control mechanisms have been readjusted, excluding

(The 71 OG/CC, individual MDS SQ/CC, Chief of FCF Section, Aircraft Maintenance
Commander, Director of Maintenance, or designated representative will determine additional
requirements generating an OCF.)
* OCF is required for any two of these maintenance actions. For single system maintenance,
forms will be signed off limiting the first flight to a rated pilot only. See following paragraph for
additional requirements generating rated pilot operational checks.
   8.16.2. The FCF OIC and QA FCF manager will:
       8.16.2.1. Establish local FCF procedures and checklists for any specific local aircraft
       requirements to include configuration, administration, control, and documentation of the
       FCF, program. Coordinate them with OG Standardization/Evaluation. Procedures will be
       published in the wing supplement/OI to this instruction.

      8.16.2.1.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Manning. IAW AFI 11-2T-1/-6/-38 Vol 1, the
      Chief of the FCF section (FCF Officer in Charge (OIC)) will be assigned to the 71st
      Operations Group (OG). The Lead FCF Pilot from each aircraft will be assigned to
      the 71st OG at the discretion of the 71 OG/CC. 71 OG/FCF will maintain an FCF
      letter of X’s indicating current manning and qualification levels of the FCF section.
      8.16.2.1.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Reporting Official. The 71 OG/CC is the
      reporting official for the Chief of FCF Section and the Lead Pilots (exception: 5 FTS
      personnel will remain under the administrative control of the 5 FTS). Additional FCF
      pilots will be assigned to their respective squadron commanders.
      8.16.2.1.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) FCF Policies.
         8.16.2.1.3.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) FCF Pilot Training and Certification. All
         71 FTW FCF pilots will be trained and maintain currency IAW applicable AFI
         11-2T-XX Volume 1 requirements. Training syllabi and training folders will be
         maintained at the 71 OG/FCF section. Letters of appointment and a current FCF
         letter of X’s will be provided to each MDS squadron training office. A letter of
         X’s will also be provided to Maintenance and Dispatch as required.
         8.16.2.1.3.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Weather Minimums. IAW T.O. 1-1-300
         FCF/OCF missions will normally be conducted in daylight under Visual
         Meteorological Conditions (VMC).
         8.16.2.1.3.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) If the reported or forecast weather
         precludes maintaining VMC for the entire mission, a weather waiver must be
         obtained from the 71 OG/CC prior to flying the mission. Aircraft flown under the
         provisions of the weather waiver must adhere to the following:
             8.16.2.1.3.3.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) The weather on takeoff must be at or
             above a 1500 foot ceiling and 3 miles visibility. If the aircraft is operating
             properly in VMC, pilots may proceed into IMC to penetrate cloud cover and
             complete the FCF/OCF while IFR ―VMC on Top.‖ All checks will be
             completed in VMC.
             8.16.2.1.3.3.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Aircraft flown under the provisions of
             this waiver will be prudently selected on the basis of existing and forecast
             weather, reason for the FCF, and necessary support of scheduled mission
             requirements. If a sortie is to be flown under the provisions of this waiver,
             approval will be obtained from the 71 OG/CC or designated representative
             prior to takeoff. Exception: T-38 and T-1 aircraft completing high altitude
             checks, above FL 250, do not need to contact the 71 OG/CC as long as it is
             possible to remain VMC during high altitude checks.
             8.16.2.1.3.3.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) When a check flight is flown under a
             weather waiver, annotate the remarks section of the AF Form 4290.
         8.16.2.1.3.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) When a flight is required to check only the
         operation of auxiliary systems or components, the flight may be initiated during
         daylight hours under IMC provided:

       used to monitor the day-to-day status of the wing’s assigned aircraft. Procedures for
       QOFs will be the same as ordinary FCFs except for the following:
          8.16.2.1.5.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Aircraft selected for QOF flights will be on
          a no-notice basis, with respect to maintenance personnel. QOF sorties will be
          scheduled in coordination with each of the flying squadrons, so as to minimize
          adverse impact on normal flying operations.
          8.16.2.1.5.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) QOF flights will be flown as full profile.
          8.16.2.1.5.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) A minimum of one QOF sortie should be
          accomplished each quarter for each aircraft type. More QOF sorties may be
          flown when required for training purposes. These sorties will be coordinated
          through the respective squadron operations officer.
          8.16.2.1.5.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) QOF sorties will not count toward the FCF
          release/non-release rate.

  8.16.4. The AMU will configure the aircraft for FCF IAW technical data and local
  directives.
  8.16.5. Flight Requirements. The mandatory requirements for FCF are outlined in TO 1-1-
  300 and the applicable Dash-6 TO. FCF profiles are determined by the maintenance
  requirement causing the FCF. The decision to fly a full profile FCF is the decision of the
  MXG/CC (AMXG/CC’s (AMARG/CC’s) and OG/CC’s discretion for ALC). Tailor the FCF
  profile for the discrepancy causing the FCF applying the following guidance:
  8.16.5. (AETC) Fly FCFs for a single-engine change on a two-engine aircraft if the aircraft
  will next fly an extended over-water flight (for example, oversea deployment). Note: This
  applies to engines with no operating time since major maintenance. It does not apply to
  engines obtained from a donor aircraft with an established operating time.
      8.16.5.1. Require a clean configuration whenever FCFs are flown for flight controls, fuel
      controls or engine changes. Do not remove fixed wing pylons, fixed wing tip tanks and
      fixed external stores unless they interfere with fuel scheduling, aerodynamic reaction, air
      loading, signal propagation, etc.
      8.16.5.1. (VANCEAFB) REQUIREMENTS for FCFs:
         8.16.5.1.1. Do not fly FCFs in conjunction with other missions or training
         requirements, unless authorized in TO 1-1-300.

        8.16.5.3.12. (Added-VANCEAFB) IAW T.O. 1-1-300, under circumstances other
        than those specified in the aircraft –6 inspection manual, the need for an aircraft FCF
        following maintenance or repair work is an engineering decision to be exercised by
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                              221


         commanders. Such decisions will be based upon the scope of work accomplished and
         consideration of the affected components relative to safety of operation.
         8.16.5.3.13. (Added-VANCEAFB) The 71 OG/CC, individual MDS SQ/CC, Chief
         of FCF Section, Aircraft Maintenance Commander, Director of Maintenance, or
         designated representative will determine additional requirements generating an FCF.
  8.16.6. FCF Release. An FCF release occurs upon the successful completion of all
  requirements as determined by the FCF aircrew. The final decision to release rests solely
  with the aircraft commander. An aircraft may be released for flight if a malfunction occurs
  during an FCF, which is not related to the condition generating the FCF and the original
  condition checks good.
     8.16.6.1. An FCF conditional release may occur when the aircraft does not successfully
     complete FCF requirements due to a specific system malfunction. The FCF aircrew, in
     coordination with maintenance, determines a FCF conditional release if the malfunction
     may be corrected without generating another FCF. If on review of the corrective action
     the FCF aircrew accepts the maintenance action as a satisfactory repair of the
     malfunction, they may release the aircraft from FCF.
     8.16.6.1. (AETC) An example of a FCF conditional release is one where the FCF is for
     engine low power and all engine systems check out with the exception of an engine oil
     pressure fluctuation. Maintenance troubleshoots this fluctuation and determines the cause
     as a defective oil pressure transmitter or gage. In this example the aircraft may be
     released.
         8.16.6.1.1. (Added-AETC) When rotary-wing aircraft encounter certain FCF
         requirements, such as blade balancing, that require multiple sorties to accomplish a
         single FCF, these sorties can be considered as one attempt, provided the need for
         multiple sorties to accomplish the FCF was identified in either the unit’s FCF OI, the
         aircraft’s dash-6 TO, or specified during the FCF briefing. The following exceptions
         apply:
         8.16.6.1.2. (Added-AETC) A multiple-sortie FCF attempt that changes its aircrew
         (all crewmembers) is terminated and coded as a non-release. A new aircrew will be
         debriefed and a new attempt initiated.
         8.16.6.1.3. (Added-AETC) A multiple-sortie FCF attempt that does not release by
         the end of the flying day is terminated and coded as a non-release. A new attempt will
         be initiated the next day.
            8.16.6.1.3.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Release vs. Non-Release:
                8.16.6.1.3.1.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) All FCF ground aborts will result in a
                non-release.
                8.16.6.1.3.1.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) An aircraft is considered a non-
                release if the system(s) for which the FCF was required fails while on the
                ground or in the air.
                8.16.6.1.3.1.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) Any FCF generated by a periodic
                inspection that terminates early due to an in-flight emergency will result in a
                non-release.
222                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


                 8.16.6.1.3.1.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) An aircraft may be released for flight
                 if a malfunction occurs during an FCF, which is not related to the condition
                 generating the FCF, and the original condition checks good.
                 8.16.6.1.3.1.5. (Added-VANCEAFB) An aircraft is considered a release if
                 the system(s) for which the FCF was required performed properly during the
                 FCF.
                 8.16.6.1.3.1.6. (Added-VANCEAFB) An FCF release occurs upon the
                 successful completion of all requirements as determined by the FCF aircrew.
                 Other malfunctions may be discovered during the course of the FCF that
                 would generate another FCF, however as long as all requirements generating
                 the sortie are met, the aircraft will be considered a release. The final decision
                 whether the flight was indeed an FCF attempt and counted as a release or non-
                 release rests solely with the Aircraft Commander.
                 8.16.6.1.3.1.7. (Added-VANCEAFB) OCF and QOF sorties are not
                 considered an FCF, for purposes of release rate calculations, regardless of the
                 results of the flight.
             8.16.6.1.3.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Conditional Release:
                 8.16.6.1.3.2.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) IAW AFI 21-101, an FCF conditional
                 release may occur when aircraft do not successfully complete FCF
                 requirements due to a specific system malfunction if the FCF aircrew (in
                 consultation with maintenance) determines the malfunction may be corrected
                 without generating another FCF.
                 8.16.6.1.3.2.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) If in the opinion of the FCF pilot the
                 aircraft can be conditionally released the following statement will be written
                 in the discrepancy block: ―Aircraft is Conditionally Released from FCF.
                 Forms review required by FCF pilot prior to returning the aircraft to
                 operational status.‖
                 8.16.6.1.3.2.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) For release rate calculations, the
                 aircraft is not considered a release until the forms review by the FCF pilot is
                 completed following all required maintenance actions. If in the opinion of the
                 FCF pilot the maintenance actions were insufficient to verify completion of
                 the original write-up`, the aircraft is considered a non-release at that point and
                 a subsequent FCF attempt is accomplished.
                 8.16.6.1.3.2.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) Following all required maintenance
                 actions for the conditional release and upon final forms review by the FCF
                 pilot, the FCF pilot will sign off the ―Inspected by‖ block. If the FCF pilot is
                 not available to sign off the conditional release, then the FCF Chief or lead
                 pilot qualified in that aircraft type will sign off release in the AFTO Form
                 781A and H.
      8.16.6.2. FCF Aborts. All ground aborts result in a non-release.
      8.16.6.2. (VANCEAFB) Abort vs. Non-Attempt:
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 223


           8.16.6.2.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Aircraft terminating an FCF early (on the ground
           or in the air) will be considered a non-attempted FCF and will not be considered in
           the calculation of the release rate, so long as the mission termination was not due to
           failure of the specific system(s) which generated the FCF.
           8.16.6.2.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) The final decision whether the flight was indeed
           an FCF attempt and counted as a release or non-release rests solely with the Aircraft
           Commander.
   8.16.7. Units must refer to Lead Command instructions for FCF procedures away from home
   station.
   8.16.7. (AETC) Units will develop guidance for FCF procedures away from home station
   using guidance provided in AFI 21-101 and this supplement as required.
8.17. Inflight Operational Checks. Inflight operational checks are accomplished at the request
of maintenance to validate a maintenance action that cannot be fully verified on the ground.
   8.17.1. Document inflight operational checks IAW TO 00-20-1.
8.18. High Speed Taxi Checks. High speed taxi checks may be utilized IAW TO 1-1-300
instead of FCFs with MXG/CC (AMXG/CC for ALC) and OG/CC authorization, high speed
taxi checks may be utilized when a maintenance ground operational check requires aircraft
movement at higher than normal taxi speeds (with qualified FCF aircrews) to operationally
check completed maintenance. Process aircraft forms through QA using FCF procedures. QA
will develop an aircrew briefing checklist specifically for high speed taxi checks, to include the
required FCF briefing items and pertinent warnings, cautions, etc.
8.18. (VANCEAFB)Responsibilities and Procedures for Accomplishing High Speed Taxi
Checks. High speed taxi checks may be utilized when maintenance operational checks require
that the aircraft be taken to higher-than-normal taxi speeds. High speed taxi checks require 71
OG/CC approval.
   8.18.1. To minimize brake and tire wear, configure aircraft with the minimum Dash-1
   operational fuel requirements. Ensure aircraft is prepared for flight and the
   Exceptional/Conditional release is signed off.
   8.18.1. (VANCEAFB) To minimize brake and tire wear, the aircraft must be configured
   with the minimum fuel required to accomplish the check, but not less than the –1 operational
   minimum on board.
   8.18.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) FCF pilots will accomplish high Speed Taxi Checks.
   8.18.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) Aircraft forms requiring a high-speed taxi check will be
   processed using normal FCF procedures. The aircraft will be completely airworthy prior to a
   high-speed taxi check. A qualified FCF pilot will perform high speed taxi checks.
   8.18.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) The FCF pilot will sign out on AF Form 4290 using normal
   FCF procedures.
   8.18.5. (Added-VANCEAFB) The pilot will notify the Squadron Supervisor, Vance
   Tower, Vance SOF, and if necessary, appropriate ground personnel prior to performing the
   check. The pilot may request the barrier be raised.
 224                          AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   8.18.6. (Added-VANCEAFB) The high-speed taxi check will only be performed during
   daylight hours and on a dry runway. Crosswinds will not exceed 15 knots for the T-38 and
   T-1 aircraft, and should not exceed 10 knots for the T-6. The following maximum speeds
   will not be exceeded:
       8.18.6.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) T-1:         100 KIAS or Vrot, Vref, Vmb whichever is
       lowest.
       8.18.6.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) T-6: 85 KIAS
       8.18.6.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) T-38: 120 KCAS or RS-BEO, whichever is lowest.
   8.18.7. (Added-VANCEAFB) All high-speed taxi checks will be performed on the center
   or outside runway. High-speed taxi checks using less than full runway length will require
   OG/CC approval.
   8.18.8. (Added-VANCEAFB) Prior to stepping, each FCF pilot will compute TOLD for
   the highest speed expected, review the abort procedures, associated warnings, cautions and
   notes in Section III of the applicable flight manual.
8.19. Weight and Balance (W&B) Program. Manage this program IAW TO 1-1B-50, Basic
Technical Order for USAF Aircraft Weight and Balance.
   8.19.1. The W&B program NCOIC/Manager (appointed by the MXG/CC (AMXG/CC or
   MA for ALC)) Responsibilities: NCOIC/Manager will ensure:
       8.19.1.1. Sufficient personnel are qualified on assigned aircraft IAW TO 1-1B-50.
       MXG/CC is the approval authority to waive W&B Course training requirements.
       8.19.1.2. All assigned aircraft are weighed IAW applicable directives. Keep W&B
       documents required by TO 1-1B-50 for each assigned aircraft. Use the Automated
       Weight and Balance System (AWBS), and keep a back-up copy of all W&B documents.
       8.19.1.3. Procedures are written for routing completed TCTO and modification
       information for W&B changes.
       8.19.1.4. A QA W&B qualified technician inspects W&B documents before flight when
       locally accomplished modifications affect the basic aircraft weight and moment. Review
       computations for accuracy.
       8.19.1.5. Essential W&B data and changes to the basic weight and moment are available
       for appropriate mission planning (e.g., Standard Configuration Loads, updates to
       supplemental handbook).
       8.19.1.5. (AETC) Units will establish local methods for documenting T-1A
       configurations, Form F filing locations and provide operations group schedulers with
       current aircraft configuration status.

       developing a W&B Preparation Checklist if the aircraft Dash-5 TO is not comprehensive
       enough for the task.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 225


       8.19.1.8. W&B manuals are maintained for Class I and II aircraft in a central file.
       Maintain and store Class I and Class II aircraft W&B handbooks IAW TO 1-1B-50. The
       method of supplemental handbook storage and physical location must be standardized by
       the lead command for like MDS. (Manage commercial derivative aircraft IAW this
       instruction, FAA procedures, contract specifications and the manufacturer’s maintenance
       manuals.) The contract logistics support (CLS) contractor is responsible for managing
       W&B programs on these aircraft.
       8.19.1.8. (AETC) Store the supplemental handbook for T-1 and T-6 aircraft as follows:
           8.19.1.8.1. (Added-AETC) On the aircraft for T-1 aircraft.
           8.19.1.8.2. (Added-AETC) At the operations desk for T-6 aircraft.
       8.19.1.9. The SCR (appointment letters for ALC) reflects W&B certification.
   8.19.2. W&B Technicians Responsibilities. Will verify scale readings and
   accomplish/oversee the actual computations. Supervise the preparation, leveling and
   weighing of the aircraft IAW MDS specific –2 and –5 series TOs and TO 1-1B-50. Inspect
   W&B documents before flight when locally accomplished modifications affect the basic
   aircraft weight and moment. Review computations for accuracy.
8.20. Chafing Awareness Program. This program is mandatory for fighter aircraft units and
other MDS IAW applicable MDS technical data. QA must monitor and track instances of wire,
harness and metal line/tube chafing. A randomly selected 10 percent of assigned aircraft are
inspected when notification is received of a potential chafing problem involving like model, lot
number or block of aircraft.
   8.20.1. The chief inspector shall recommend initiating an OTI if the sampled aircraft
   indicates a chafing problem or the detected chafing is an operational safety hazard.
   8.20.2. QA must develop local chafing inspection work cards if there are no requirements in
   the Dash-6 TOs, for periodic, pre-flight, thru-flight and basic post-flight inspections. Ensure
   local work cards cover at least 50 percent of accessible areas, focusing on known chafing
   areas.
   8.20.3. QA must utilize a database for the purpose of tracking wire and harness chafing
   problems identified through OTIs and maintenance cross-tell reports. Consult the database
   before expending man-hours performing inspections.
8.21. Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE)/Quality Assurance Representative (QAR). If a
CLS aircraft or CFT is assigned, a QAE/QAR must be appointed and trained IAW AFI 63-124.

Section 8B—ALC in addition to section 8A the following guidance applies

8.22. QA Responsibilities. QA to include safety and environmental personnel will be centrally
aligned under the MXW/CC. Responsible to the MXW/CC to perform as the primary technical
advisory agency, assisting maintenance supervision at all levels to resolve quality problems,
jointly develop corrective action strategies and enhance the overall quality of maintenance.
Although centrally aligned at the wing level, a knowledgeable and well qualified QA work force
will be dedicated to, and collocated within the production groups to ensure continuous, seamless
and enduring customer support is provided as required.
 226                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   8.22.1. MXW/CC/CL/CD must provide the required resources to ensure effective quality
   assessments of the products, services, programs and processes. The chain of accountability
   and responsibility for quality products, services, programs and processes is directly
   to/through the Commanders, Directors, Division Chiefs, Flight Chiefs, Production
   Superintendents, and maintenance employees and will not be levied on quality organizations.

                             IMPOUNDMENT PROCEDURES

9.1. Aircraft and Equipment Impoundment. Aircraft or equipment is impounded when
intensified management is warranted due to system or component malfunction or failure of a
serious or chronic nature. Refer to AFI 91-204 for aircraft and equipment involved in accidents,
mishaps or incidents.
9.2. Specific Guidance. MXG/CCs (or equivalent) will appoint Impoundment Authorities and
Impoundment Release Authorities. QA is the OPR for the Impoundment Program and develops
local checklists. Impounding aircraft and equipment enables investigative efforts to
systematically proceed with minimal risk relative to intentional/unintentional actions and
subsequent loss of evidence. MXG/CCs will develop and publish (if required) an impoundment
program in a local supplement to this instruction or OI and ensure compliance with the
procedures in this chapter. ALC: MXW/CC will assign an OPR who manages the impoundment
program, creates an impoundment checklist and ensures compliance with the procedures in this
chapter.
9.3. Impoundment Terms:
   9.3.1. Authorized Personnel. Individuals directly involved in the management, safing,
   troubleshooting, or repair of impounded aircraft or equipment.
   9.3.2. Impoundment. Impoundment is the isolation or control of access to an aircraft or
   equipment item and applicable historical records so an intensified investigation can be
   completed.
   9.3.3. Impoundment Authority. Individual authorized to impound aircraft or equipment.
   MXG/CCs (or equivalent) will designate Impoundment Authorities and they will be tracked
   on the SCR. The Impoundment Authority will select the Impoundment Official.
   9.3.4. Impoundment Release Authority. Individuals authorized to release aircraft or
   equipment from impoundment. The MXG/CC and MXG/CD (or equivalents) have authority
   to release aircraft and equipment. In the event of a dual MXG/CC and CD absence, the
   MXG/CC or CD will appoint an individual in writing as the designated impoundment release
   authority for the period of the dual absence. This authority will not be delegated in ALC.
   9.3.4. (VANCEAFB) Impoundment release authority is limited to the DOM or his/her
   designated representatives. This designation will be in writing.
   9.3.5. Impoundment Official. The Impoundment Official will hold the minimum rank of
   MSgt (First line supervisor for ALC). Impoundment Officials are the single point of contact
   for the affected aircraft or equipment item and are responsible for controlling, monitoring,
   and investigating the impounded aircraft or equipment.
   9.3.6. Isolation Area. An area designated by the Impoundment Authority to locate
   impounded aircraft or equipment. Aircraft may be isolated on the flightline or in hangars.
   The isolation area will be marked off using cones, ropes, or placards indicating the
   impoundment condition and isolation area.

   equipment. They are responsible for controlling and monitoring the investigation of
   impounded aircraft or equipment. The Impoundment Official ensures only authorized
   personnel have access to the impounded aircraft or equipment.
9.6. Impoundment Process and Procedures.
   9.6.1. When the Impoundment Authority directs impoundment, a Red X symbol will be
   placed in the applicable AFTO Form/IMT 781A/electronic equivalent or AFTO IMT 244
   with a statement indicating the reason for impoundment and the name of the assigned
   Impoundment Official.
   9.6.1. (VANCEAFB) To maintain continuity of the maintenance actions, absolutely no
   maintenance or servicing actions are performed on the impounded aircraft until released for
   maintenance by the Impoundment Official. This release is documented in the same
   discrepancy block of the AFTO 781A as the impoundment entry and will read, "Aircraft
   Released for Maintenance.‖ Also include the time, date and signature of the Impoundment
   Official.
   9.6.2. The MOC/Maintenance Control Center will be notified when an impoundment
   decision has been made.
   9.6.3. The Impoundment Official will use established checklists to guide the sequence of
   actions.
   9.6.3. (VANCEAFB) All completed checklists will be filed in the QA office.
   9.6.4. The Impoundment Official will control access to impounded aircraft or equipment.
   Establish an Entry Control Point (ECP) if required.
      9.6.4.1. If an ECP is established, the Impoundment Official will ensure an access control
      log (manual or electronic) is maintained at the ECP of the impounded aircraft, equipment
      or storage facility to track personnel entering and leaving the area.
          9.6.4.1.1. The log will contain the following information as a minimum: individual’s
          name, rank, and employee number/stamp, date arrived/departed, and reason for entry.
          9.6.4.1.2. The log will be maintained and reviewed on a daily basis until the

          after the aircraft is successfully repaired.
   9.6.5. Aircraft or equipment records will be controlled at the discretion of the Impoundment
   Official. When required, the Impoundment Official will:
      9.6.5.1. Obtain and secure the current aircraft forms and the aircraft jacket file for
      aircraft or the AFTO IMT 244 for equipment.
      9.6.5.2. Notify the MIS DBM (PDMSS, MAXIMO, etc) to isolate the aircraft or
      equipment serial number in order to prevent any changes and maintain the integrity of the
      historical data until the aircraft or equipment is released.
 232                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


          9.6.5.2.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Ensure aircraft records are impounded for an
          accident or incident that may require a safety investigation. The records are collected
          and picked up by the COR office. The Impoundment Official picks up all other
          impounded records.
       9.6.5.3. Request any personnel records required to complete the impoundment
       investigation. These records may include, but are not limited to, individual training
       records.
       9.6.5.4. On aircraft impounded for potential safety related incidents, ensure the
       CVR/FDR circuit breakers are pulled immediately after engine shutdown or before
       applying external power to safeguard CVR/FDR data.
   9.6.6. Maintenance will be limited on impounded aircraft or equipment until the cause is
   determined. The Impoundment Official will determine what maintenance can be performed
   in conjunction with the maintenance required to release the aircraft or equipment from
   impoundment. Limit maintenance actions to those required to make the aircraft safe.
       9.6.6.1. Parts removed from impounded aircraft or equipment will be carefully
       controlled. This is to ensure that parts, once confirmed as the cause for impoundment, are
       available to be processed as DR exhibits.
   9.6.7. The Impoundment Official selects a team of qualified technicians dedicated to
   determine the cause of the problem that led to the impoundment. Impoundment team
   members will be relieved of all other duties (not applicable to ARC) until released by the
   Impoundment Official.
   9.6.8. The Impoundment Release Authority determines the need for a one-time flight and
   requests appropriate authorization IAW TO 00-20-1.
   9.6.9. Once the cause of the malfunction or failure has been positively determined, the
   Impoundment Official briefs the Impoundment Release Authority on findings, corrective
   actions, and requests release of the aircraft or equipment from impoundment.
   9.6.10. If the cause of the discrepancy could potentially affect other aircraft or equipment in
   the fleet, QA (MXG production for ALC) will provide cross-tell information for up-
   channeling to the MAJCOM weapon system functional manager, lead command and the
   designated Weapon System Lead Command IAW AFPD 10-9.
   9.6.11. Clear impoundments from forms/MIS IAW TO 00-20-1.
   9.6.12. If the cause of a reported malfunction cannot be determined or a positive corrective
   action cannot be confirmed, the Impoundment Release Authority will determine if further
   actions are required (e.g., requesting depot assistance, further troubleshooting, FCF/OCF).
   9.6.13. When an aircraft is away from home station and encounters a problem warranting
   impoundment, the following procedures must be followed:
       9.6.13.1. Established impoundment procedures must be followed. The MXG/CC or
       designated representative may temporarily delegate Impoundment and Release Authority
       to the deployed MOO/MX SUPT.
9.6. (AETC) Impoundment Process and Procedures. See Attachment 13 (Added) for an
aircraft and equipment impoundment checklist. For impounded transient aircraft, the supporting
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                233


organization is responsible for releasing the aircraft from impoundment in coordination with the
owning unit (see AFI 21-101, paragraph 9.6.13.1).
9.7. Rules of Impoundment Specifically for Explosive-Related Mishaps. When an
inadvertent/uncommanded release or an explosive mishap is reported, the following procedures
apply:
   9.7.1. In-flight:
       9.7.1.1. When the involved aircraft returns to the de-arm or parking area, the aircraft is
       impounded. Limit maintenance actions to those required to make the aircraft safe.
       9.7.1.2. Inform the MXG/CC, MOC, Munitions Control, WWM, QA and the wing/base
       safety office of the impoundment action.
       9.7.1.3. Park and isolate aircraft with unsafe munitions in an area approved by weapons
       safety and airfield management.
       9.7.1.4. Investigate and report the incident IAW AFI 91-204.
       9.7.1.4. (AETC) Also refer to AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and
       Reports, AETC supplement for additional requirements.
   9.7.2. Ground:
       9.7.2.1. The senior ground crew member is in charge of the aircraft or equipment until
       relieved and ensures involved persons remain at the scene.
       9.7.2.2. Protect other aircraft or equipment located near the incident if an explosive
       hazard exists.
       9.7.2.3. Do not change the position of any switches except as needed for safety. Limit
       maintenance actions to those actions required to make the aircraft or equipment safe.
   9.7.3. Preserve mishap evidence to the maximum extent possible. An example would be
   segregating an aircraft gun versus destroying it if it poses no immediate danger. This allows
   for evaluation of all the evidence and the ability to recreate the mishap conditions.
   9.7.4. If a malfunctioning munitions item (live or inert) causes a mishap, also notify OO-
   ALC/WM's Munitions Rapid Response Team at DSN 777-4865/5155, 775-5507/3208 and
   777-AMMO or 775-AMMO, or the Hill AFB Command Post at 777-3007. This team is
   comprised of experts (engineers, equipment specialists, program managers and safety
   personnel) from the conventional weapons and munitions programs and can respond within
   24 to 48 hours to assist in determining the cause of a failure. Initial contact, as soon as
   practical, shall allow the team to make travel arrangements and aids response time. For units
   with 20 or 30MM gun systems use of the team is encouraged (not mandatory unless a safety
   issue exists) if the cause of a gun system jam cannot be easily determined or for recurring
   jams. Using the team provides highly valuable information regarding ammunition/gun
   system problems and allows ALC personnel to see issues first hand.

                        TOOL AND EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT

10.1. Tool and Equipment Management. The objectives of the tool and equipment
management program are to prevent and eliminate FOD to aircraft, engines, missiles, training
and support equipment, and to reduce costs through strict effective control and accountability of
assets. To ensure standardization among maintenance units, commanders and key leaders are
responsible for executing an effective tool program. Tool and equipment management applies to
CWOs and ALCs. Depot teams/factory reps/CFTs/NSOs and small/unique units shall adhere to
AF/Lead Command/Local guidance for tool control policies and procedures when working on
aerospace equipment possessed by the unit. The tool management program outlined in this
instruction represents AF minimum program requirements; Lead Commands may dictate
additional requirements.
10.2. Guidelines for Program Management.
   10.2.1. The MXG/CC (MXW/CC for ALC or equivalent functional authority for
   maintenance) is the OPR for the development of wing OIs for control and management of
   tools/equipment used on the flightline and aircraft/aerospace equipment maintenance
   industrial areas. As a minimum, guidance will address the following:
   10.2.1. (AETC) The wing instruction must address the minimum requirements in AFI 21-
   101 when tools/equipment are used on the flight line, aircraft/aerospace equipment industrial
   areas, runways, and taxi ways. In contractor organizations, the wing will appoint a
   noncontractor POC to develop the wing instruction.
       10.2.1.1. Standardized procedures for security, control, and accountability (e.g., chits,
       manual, barcode, etc.) of tools and equipment to include weapons load crew crimpers,
       die, lead seals, and engine blade blending blue dye. Chits are not authorized except in
       ALC units to identify missing/removed tools for dispatchable CTK/TKs. Note:
       Dispatchable equipment is defined as items that can be checked out from a support
       section/tool room/work center to perform on-/off-equipment maintenance outside the
       work center.
           10.2.1.1.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) 71 FTW Commander is responsible for
           controlling tools, equipment, and electronic devices from all wing agencies
           dispatching to the flightline or any maintenance areas. 71 FTW/MAQ is the OPR for
           this instruction, and will serve as subject matter experts to assist functional CORs
           with setting up an effective program.
           10.2.1.1.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) All commanders and contracted service providers
           at all levels are responsible for ensuring agencies under their authority account for
           tools, equipment, and electronic devices dispatched to the flightline or any
           maintenance areas.
           10.2.1.1.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) Commanders and the Director of Maintenance
           will:
              10.2.1.1.3.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Develop and document procedures defining
              tool security, control, and accountability in accordance with AFI 21-101, AETC
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                              235


            sup 1, Chapter 10 from all wing agencies dispatching to the flightline or any
            maintenance areas.
     10.2.1.2. Inventory requirements. As a minimum, conduct and document an annual
     inventory of all tools and equipment.
     10.2.1.3. Procedures for warranted tool management.
     10.2.1.4. Procedures for control and management of replacement, expendable and
     consumable hand tools, HAZMATs, and other items contained in CTKs/TKs.
     10.2.1.5. Procedures for transfer of tools/CTKs/TKs at the job site (on-site transfers).
     CTKs/TKs are not normally passed from one individual to another at the job site;
     however, mission needs occasionally require this action to occur. Ensure tool
     accountability and control is maintained when transfer occurs between the individuals. As
     a minimum the individuals involved in the transfer will accomplish a joint inventory and
     document accordingly.
     10.2.1.6. Procedures for lost or missing tools.
     10.2.1.7. Assignment of equipment identification designators (EID) for CTKs/TKs, non-
     CA/CRL equipment, and assignment of CTK/TK numbers for tools.
     10.2.1.8. Procedures for issue and control of PPE (e.g., ear protectors, reflective belts,
     headsets). Mark tools or equipment that a work center assigns/issues to an individual.
     10.2.1.9. Procedures to ensure positive control of rags.
        10.2.1.9.1. A rag is defined as a remnant of cloth purchased in bulk or a standardized,
        commercial quality, vendor-supplied shop cloth used in general industrial, shop, and
        flightline operations. Cheesecloth is considered a rag, however, paper products/paper
        towels are not considered rags. Rags should be uniform in size and color.
        10.2.1.9.2. Marking or identifying each shop rag with a CTK number is not
        necessary. Issue and receipt procedures will be established to ensure positive control
        and accountability of each rag that leaves a CTK area. Some recommended methods
        of shop rag control include:
            10.2.1.9.2.1. Issuing rags on a one-for-one swap.
            10.2.1.9.2.2. Issuing a predetermined number of rags with CTKs and include
            them on the CTK contents listing.
            10.2.1.9.2.3. Issuing rags in pre-packaged containers with the number of rags
            marked on each container.
     10.2.1.10. Procedures to limit numbers of personnel authorized to procure tools.
     10.2.1.11. Procedures for control of locally manufactured or developed tools and
     equipment.
     10.2.1.12. Procedures for depot teams, factory representatives, and CFTs when working
     on equipment within the unit.
     10.2.1.12. (VANCEAFB) Depot team, factory representative or contract field teams
     that work on aircraft or equipment will comply with applicable Air Force procedures for
 236                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


       tool control and accountability. If the Air Force, contractor, or the team does not have
       any provisions concerning tool control or accountability, the team leader/supervisor will
       coordinate with the MAQ office to develop a program. The guidelines developed will be
       in writing and signed by the Chief COR and the team leader/supervisor. The MAQ office
       and the team leader will maintain a copy of this letter for the duration of the stay.
       10.2.1.13. Procedures and responsibilities for situations where two or more work centers
       operate a single tool room/support section, or when work centers elect to distribute
       CTKs/TKs or peculiar support/test equipment to decentralized locations.
       10.2.1.14. Procedures for control of CDDAR and hydrazine response equipment
       permanently stored/located in trailers or vehicles.
       10.2.1.15. Procedures for requiring a second party or on-duty supervisor inspection of
       CTKs/TKs when conditions warrant a single person shift. The same individual that signs
       out a CTK/TK cannot sign it back in.
       10.2.1.15. (AETC) The requirement for a second party or supervisor to inspect a tool kit
       upon turn-in does not apply to personnel manning a support section for the purpose of
       issuing and inspecting tool kits.
       10.2.1.16. Procedures for controlled access to tool rooms.
       10.2.1.17. Procedures to control aircrew tools and AFE tool kits that are dispatchable to
       the flightline. Coordinate procedures through the Wing AFE Superintendent.
10.3. General Program Guidelines.
   10.3.1. The FLT CC/Chief (First line supervisor for ALC) will designate CTK/TK
   custodians in writing. CTK/TK custodians are responsible for tool, HAZMAT, and
   consumable asset accountability and control (Exception; a separate person may be
   designated as the HAZMAT monitor).
   10.3.1. (AETC) In small work centers, it may be impractical to designate a full-time CTK
   custodian. Work centers fitting this criteria usually have a small number of personnel
   assigned and may share the same CTK to perform their maintenance tasks. There may also be
   work centers where the only tool management functions being performed are issuing,
   inventorying, and securing CTKs and equipment. In work centers such as these, the work
   center supervisor may designate a member of the maintenance team to be a CTK monitor.
   10.3.1. (VANCEAFB) Develop a system of inventory and control for all items brought out
   to the flightline or any maintenance areas to ensure they are returned to the section upon the
   completion of the job.
       10.3.1.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Notify their functional Contracting Officer’s
       Representative (COR) of program compliance to coordinate an initial evaluation.
       10.3.1.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Functional COR will conduct an initial evaluation of
       each section’s program and provide inputs to ensure compliance. Once established, each
       program will receive an annual evaluation by COR. Evaluations will be graded as either
       ―compliant‖ or ―non-compliant‖ with this instruction.
   10.3.2. Flight chiefs/section NCOICs (or equivalents) determine the type, size, contents and
   number of CTKs required for their work centers, this responsibility lies with the WWM for
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                    237


  load crew CTKs. The WWM will approve/sign a single MIL to be used as the standard for all
  Load Crew CTKs on like mission-design-series aircraft; a copy will be maintained in each
  support section.
  10.3.3. Design CTK/TKs to provide a quick inventory and accountability of tools. Clearly
  mark all CTKs/TKs and tools with the EID (follow guidance below).
  10.3.4. CTK/TK contents will be standardized to the maximum extent possible within
  functional elements of a squadron that have similar missions (e.g., aircraft flights/sections
  and CASTs).
  10.3.5. Each tool, item of equipment, or consumable contained in a CTK/TK has an assigned
  location identified either by inlay cuts in the shape of the item, shadowed layout, label, or
  silhouette. No more than one item is stored in a cutout, shadow, or silhouette except for tools
  issued in sets such as drill bits, allen wrenches, apexes, or paired items (e.g., gloves, booties).
     10.3.5.1. (Added-AETC) Tools issued for use in a pouch, lineman’s kit or container
     that prohibits silhouetting and/or shadowing, will be identified on the MIL to facilitate
     inventory and control. Include the CTK number of the pouch or kit and the quantity,
     nomenclature, and CTK number (if different) for each tool included in the kit.
         10.3.5.1.1. (AETC) Units tracking tools manually may use AETC Form 1042, CTK
         Tool Checklist or other approved form to facilitate inventory and control. Maintain a
         copy of the form in the CTK storage facility. Contract units using a chit system will
         ensure chits are controlled as tools to include a beginning and end of shift inventory.
         Do not issue chits directly to individuals or remove them from tool rooms. Ensure
         chit control boards are located in secure locations.
     10.3.5.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Develop and document procedures defining tool
     security, control, and accountability and as a minimum include:
         10.3.5.2.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Each agency will appoint Composite Tool Kit
         (CTK) custodians (primary/alternate) to manage, control, and monitor tool and
         equipment requirements.
         10.3.5.2.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Develop procedures that require initial approval
         by the agencies functional COR and an annual program review by the functional
         COR. For additional assistance, contact 71 FTW/MAQ at (213-6569/6154).
         10.3.5.2.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) Limit the number of individuals authorized to
         procure tools and ensure CTKs are properly managed.
         10.3.5.2.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) Establish a listing of all items dispatched out.
         Individual tool boxes will include an inventory of all items in that box.
         10.3.5.2.5. (Added-VANCEAFB) Assurance of physical accountability of all items
         on the MIL before and after each duty day or shift.
         10.3.5.2.6. (Added-VANCEAFB) Ensure a method to show custodial responsibility
         of items checked out for use on the flightline or in any maintenance areas.
         10.3.5.2.7. (Added-VANCEAFB) Program Continuity Book: Specific contents are
         at the discretion of the flight chief/section NCOIC (or equivalent), but should include
         shop policy and the MIL.
238                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


         10.3.5.2.8. (Added-VANCEAFB) Conduct and document an annual inventory of all
         tools and equipment to encompass an extensive inspection of all tools and equipment
         for general condition, serviceability and markings.
  10.3.6. A Master Inventory List (MIL) Is required for each CTK or series of identical CTKs.
  Note: When Tool Accountability System (TAS) is used, the MIL resides in TAS, but a hard
  copy of the MIL must reside with each dispatchable CTK or series of identical kits. When
  items such as dispatchable support equipment or dispatchable special tools are issued
  separately and contain multiple parts, an inventory of the multiple items must be provided
  with the equipment or special tools. Units are required to electronically back up their
  respective database at least once a month. This backup must be kept separate from the
  computer that houses the tool control database.
      10.3.6.1. For units not required to use TAS, contents are identified on the MIL by
      drawer/section indicating the number and type of each item in the CTK and total number
      of all items in each drawer/section.
      10.3.6.2. If chits/dog tags/identification tags or similar tags or dust caps are attached to
      tools/equipment, they will be secured in a manner that will preclude any possibility of
      FOD. Locks(s), key(s), and tie down strap(s), if not permanently attached, will be
      marked/etched with the appropriate CTK number. All items are listed on the MIL.
      10.3.6.3. Consumables may be placed in CTKs. If so, they are identified on the MIL as
      consumables. Examples of consumables include; safety wire, adhesive, wire bundle
      lacing, solder, etc. Do not include common hardware items such as bolts, nuts, and/or
      screws unless they are required as tools.
      10.3.6.4. Tool sets are identified on the MIL by total number of items in the set (e.g.,
      allen wrench set - 9 each allen wrenches + container for a total of 10).
      10.3.6.5. Document missing, removed and/or broken tools/items in TAS if they cannot
      be replaced immediately. In addition, for dispatchable CTKs and dispatchable support
      equipment/dispatchable special tools containing multiple parts, document the missing,
      removed and/or broken tools/items on a MAJCOM/locally generated form, or on the hard
      copy MIL. Pencil/pen may be used for hard copy MIL documentation and erased when
      cleared. Remove the EID from any permanently removed tool/item. A permanently
      removed (without planned replacement) tool/item constitutes a change to the inventory
      and requires a new MIL.
      10.3.6.5. (AETC) Units may use AETC Form 1042 to identify tools or other items
      missing, removed and/or broken from a CTK.
         10.3.6.5.1. If a MAJCOM/locally generated form is used, the form will be kept with
         each dispatchable CTK/dispatchable support equipment/dispatchable special tools as
         identified in para 10.3.6.
      10.3.6.6. The CTK/TK custodian has the authority to interchange "like" (form, fit,
      function)items.
  10.3.7. Equipment and accessories that do not present a FOD potential and will not leave the
  work center, support section, or tool room, need not be included in a CTK/TK; however, this
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 239


  equipment must have designated storage locations established. Designated locations may be
  work areas or stations
     10.3.7.1. Establish designated locations for test equipment and common accessories
     (e.g., waveguides, attenuators, fittings, cables, adapters) that are not part of a CTK/TK.
     As a minimum, designated locations will be labeled to identify the contents.
     10.3.7.2. Industrial shop machinery accessories/attachments (e.g., blades, arbors, chucks,
     gears) need not be controlled as tools; however, these items will be maintained in
     designated storage locations for accountability. As a minimum, storage cabinets/drawers
     will be labeled to identify the contents.
  10.3.8. Tools/expendable items used for titanium engine blade blending or oxygen system
  maintenance will be kept in special purpose kits separate from other tools. In addition to
  normal CTK/TK identification, these kits will be marked ―For Titanium Engine Blade
  Blending Only‖. For tools utilized in oxygen system maintenance, mark the kits with the
  following statement: ―For Oxygen System Use Only‖.
  10.3.9. Discard removable (e.g., slide on) pocket clips from tools when possible (flashlights,
  continuity testers, small screwdrivers, etc.) prior to placement in tool kits. Do not
  disassemble/damage tools for sole purpose of removing clips (e.g.. tape measures), rubber
  switch guards, etc.
  10.3.10. Tools not controlled through CTK/TK procedures are NOT authorized on the
  flightline, or in any maintenance area (e.g., personal; mini-mag flashlights, leathermans, buck
  knives, etc.). Lead Commands will develop procedures to mark and control equipment that a
  work center assigns/issues to an individual. Personally-purchased tools are not authorized.
  10.3.10. (AETC) The MXG/CC will develop procedures to mark and control equipment
  that is assigned or issued to individuals. Also see paragraph 10.2.1.8.
     10.3.10.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Unit issued PPE (e.g. reflective belts, whistles, ear
     defenders, etc.) will be properly marked with last name, first initial, work center/unit, and
     employee number before dispatched for use on the flightline or in any maintenance area.
     10.3.10.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Use of pagers (beepers), cellular telephones, portable
     stereos, or any other personally owned electronic devices is not authorized on the
     flightline or in any maintenance area. Exception: Pagers, laptops, and cellular telephone
     use is authorized in conjunction with official business and will be marked to ensure
     control and accountability.
  10.3.11. Flashlights, lanterns, portable lighting devices and light sources will conform to the
  requirements of TO 00-25-172 when used during servicing operations, TO 1-1-3 when used
  during fuel cell maintenance, and AFMAN 91-201 when used in explosive environments.
  Note: Aircraft and equipment TOs may dictate additional restrictions.
  10.3.12. For deployment purposes, ensure equipment, tools, and HAZMAT items are
  properly identified, prepared, and documented IAW AFI 10-403.
  10.3.13. (Added-AETC) Do not use electric motor-driven tools (including drills, sanders,
  and screwdrivers) on or in the immediate vicinity of aircraft. Non-motor-driven electric tools,
  such as soldering irons, are authorized for use on aircraft. The following exemptions apply:
 240                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


       10.3.13.1. (Added-AETC) Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL®)-approved vacuum
       cleaners may be used in and around aircraft if they are maintained and controlled as CTK
       equipment items and are not used in areas prone to flammable or gaseous mixtures.
       10.3.13.2. (Added-AETC) Battery-powered screwdrivers and drills may be used to
       remove and replace fasteners that attach panels to aircraft structures except as follows:
          10.3.13.2.1. (Added-AETC) Do not use to install fasteners that require a torque
          value unless the tool is equipped with an approved torque-sensing device calibrated
          by PMEL.
          10.3.13.2.2. (Added-AETC) Do not use in class 1, division 1, hazardous areas; to
          install or remove fasteners from fuel tanks, fuel cell cavities, or nacelles; within a 1-
          foot radius of fuel vents that extend upward from the floor to a level of 5 feet above
          the fuel vent; within 18 inches of the floor; or when there is a known or suspected
          fuel leak or spill. Tool battery exchanges and recharges will not be conducted in class
          1, division 1 or 2, hazardous areas.
       10.3.13.3. (Added-AETC) Air-powered tools may be used on aircraft; however, do not
       use air-powered drills with apexes for aircraft panel installations unless they are equipped
       with a torque-sensing device calibrated by PMEL.
10.4. Tool Accountability. Flight commanders/chiefs and section NCOICs, (First level
supervisors/section chiefs for ALC) through CTK/TK custodians, are responsible for tool and
equipment accountability and control (knowing where tools are and who has responsibility for
them.) When a person signs for a tool or piece of equipment, they are accountable for the item
until it is returned to the tool room and accountability transfers back to the CTK/TK custodian
(through a representative or tool room employee.)
   10.4.1. All units must use TAS/Facility and Equipment Maintenance System (FEMS) for
   accountability and control of tools and equipment. ANG, Contractors and Civil Service
   Organizations/MEOs are not required to use TAS/FEMS and AFE Sections will follow
   guidance given in AFI 11-301 Vol 1.
   10.4.1. (AETC) Units currently using a tool management system other then Tool
   Accountability System (TAS) are not required to implement TAS. ALIS is used to manage
   tools for the F-35 aircraft.
       10.4.1.1. Units will use TAS to:
          10.4.1.1.1. Track the issuance and receipt of all assigned tools, equipment, tool kits,
          HAZMAT items, TOs (does not apply to TOs, equipment and HAZMAT kept in a
          shop and not dispatched.)
              10.4.1.1.1.1. Hazmat items issued for one time use (oil cans, hydraulic cans,
              mixing compounds) are supply items and do not have to be tracked in TAS.
              Hazmat and supply procedures must still be followed.
          10.4.1.1.2. Track    authorizations/restrictions   for   special   tools/equipment   (by
          individual)
          10.4.1.1.3. Track CTK and Support Section inspections as a minimum
          10.4.1.1.4. Track spare, lost, and damaged (removed) tools
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               241


         10.4.1.1.5. Develop and manage tool/equipment inventories
         10.4.1.1.6. Develop and manage deployment kits (import/export)
     10.4.1.2. If TAS/FEMS is not available (such as at a deployed location), units may use a
     chit system, AF IMT 1297, or a Lead Command or locally approved form for
     accountability and control of CTKs/TKs, equipment, and tools. When using a chit
     system, chits are controlled as tools to include a beginning and end of shift inventory. Do
     not issue chits directly to individuals or remove them from tool rooms. Chit control
     boards are located in secure locations.
     10.4.1.2. (AETC) Units authorized to use a manual tool control system/program may
     use AETC Form 1042 or another system for accountability and control of tools.
     10.4.1.3. Units that experience problems with the system should contact the 754th
     ELSG/ILMM at DSN 596-5771/Comm 334-416-5771 for assistance. However the
     decision has been made at HQAF level to no longer fund upgrades and repairs to TAS in
     preparation of the implementation of the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS)
     in FY12.
         10.4.1.3.1. The Air Force acknowledges the sustainment office may not be able to
         rectify all problems with TAS due to this lack of funding. The AF/A4L authorizes
         units to identify and justify an alternate automated tool tracking system for the
         interim until ECSS is made available as long as the following requirements are met:
         10.4.1.3.1. (AETC) Units currently using TAS will not implement a substitute tool
         management system unless approved by HQ AETC/A4M.
            10.4.1.3.1.1. All provisions of subparagraphs to AFI 21-101 para 10.4.1.1 are
            met.
            10.4.1.3.1.2. The time frame required to acquire the alternate system is identified.
            10.4.1.3.1.3. Acquisition and sustainment costs are identified.
            10.4.1.3.1.4. System will be unit funded to include sustainment until ECSS
            implementation.
         10.4.1.3.2. The request and justification for an interim alternate tracking system will
         be approved through the Lead Command Functional and ECSS champion and
         formally submitted through the ECSS A4RB process.
         10.4.1.3.3. Upon ECSS implementation, all maintenance units will be required to use
         the ECSS tool control capability suite. This suite will replace TAS and any other
         remaining systems performing like functions. The system specifics have yet to be
         defined (embedded or bolt on to ECSS interface). If the transition from the locally
         chosen system (other than TAS) is not compatible with ECSS then the unit will be
         responsible for loading all required data into ECSS.
  10.4.2. Account for all CTKs/TKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment at the beginning and
  end of each shift. Shift inventories must be documented by both outgoing and incoming
  personnel. CTKs/TKS present during tool room shift inventories do not need to be opened
  for inventory.
242                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


      10.4.2.1. Perform a visual inventory of all CTKs/TKs when issued for use, at the
      completion of job or tasks, and when returned to the tool storage facility. Accomplish a
      CTK/TK inventory prior to operation of any aircraft or equipment when maintenance
      actions were performed (e.g., engine run, landing gear retraction, flight control
      operational checks.) Note: Upon returning to the work area after sheltering for real-
      world/exercise events an immediate and complete inventory of all CTKs/TKs will be
      conducted.
      10.4.2.2. At least annually or when the CTK/TK custodian changes, conduct a
      comprehensive inventory of all tools, non-CA/CRL equipment, and CTKs/TKs. The
      purpose of this inventory is to perform an extensive inspection of all tools and non-
      CA/CRL equipment, to include condition, identification markings, and accuracy of the
      MIL/TK/CRL Supplemental Listing. Inspect all tools for serviceability IAW TO 32-1-
      101. CTK/TK custodians document these inventories and maintain the most current
      inventory documentation on file.
  10.4.3. Electronic Tools (E-Tools). E-Tools (desktop and laptop computers, hand held
  devices, portable maintenance aids (PMA), etc.) are common infrastructure, allow access to
  logistics information systems, update TOs, provide automated change requests (similar to
  AFTO Form 22) and integrate with other Maintenance Information Systems (MIS).
  Workgroup managers shall monitor E-Tool configuration (operating system, virus checkers,
  etc.) IAW 33-series AFIs.
      10.4.3.1. E-Tools purchased and used for the purpose of viewing digital technical data
      and/or for maintenance documentation must be accounted for as automated data
      processing equipment (ADPE) IAW 33-series AFI's and tracked in TAS. E-tools
      designed specifically for a weapon system (e.g., F-22 PMA) will be accounted for on an
      equipment account (CA/CRL) and tracked in TAS/FEMS.
      10.4.3.2. Licenses, certification, maintenance and security of E-Tools (hardware and
      software) must also be IAW 33-series AFIs and AFI 21-116. Units must make maximum
      use of E-Tool warranties and ensure only serviceable E-Tools with charged batteries, up
      to date system software, and current technical data are available for checkout.
      10.4.3.3. IAW 33-series AFIs, E-Tools are for official use and authorized purposes only.
      Their primary purpose is to view digitized tech data, but may be used for other official
      uses. Lead Commands will establish policy for use of E-Tools for purposes other than
      viewing digitized tech data and maintenance documentation. GP CCs will establish
      procedures to ensure sufficient E-Tool availability for technical order viewing.
      10.4.3.3. (AETC) The following guidance does not apply to workstations/desktops. E-
      tools will be used for viewing electronic technical orders and maintenance documentation
      purposes only. E-tools will not be used for e-mail or other personal computer type uses.
      E-tools that require Microsoft Office Suites or other software applications to support
      viewing electronic technical orders and maintenance documentation may be loaded on e-
      tools, but applications such as Outlook and internet access will be sufficiently disabled to
      ensure compliance with this policy.
      10.4.3.4. TODO's may not have a traditional role in managing tech data when technical
      data management is accomplished by another agency (i.e., the manufacturer).
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                243


      10.4.3.5. The Lead TODO(s) shall work with other TODOs and TODAs (and
      CSAs/FSAs if required) to ensure E-Tools are configured with current software to
      support TO and maintenance documentation.
10.5. Tool and Equipment Marking and Identification.
   10.5.1. All units (ALCs see Para 10.5.7) must mark their tools and equipment with the
   standard EID and utilize the AF-approved TAS/FEMS(ANG, Contractors and Civil Service
   Organizations/MEOs are not required to use TAS/FEMS). Geographically separated units
   may use the parent wing EID. New tools (spare replacements) stored in the tool crib do not
   need to be etched until placement in a specific CTK (ANG must be fully compliant by
   FY11).
   10.5.1. (AETC) Contractor and Civil Service Organizations/MEOs are not required to
   remark tools and equipment with the equipment identification designator (EID) if not using
   TAS. However, when the tool management component of Expeditionary Combat Support
   System (ECSS) is fielded, all units will be required to use ECSS and mark tools and
   equipment with the EID. Non-TAS organizations should consider preparing for this
   transition in an effort to limit the initial impact.
      10.5.1.1. The EID will consist of nine characters (numbers/letters) of which the first four
      characters will be a unique World Wide Identification (WWID) code. Note: The intent is
      for the four characters of the WWID to identify the base (first and second character), unit
      (third character), and shop (fourth character) in order to leave the remaining five
      characters available for tool/CTK equipment numbering.
          10.5.1.1.1. The first two characters of the WWID in the EID are based on the
          wing’s/unit’s personnel assignment system (PAS) base code. Multiple wings (or
          equivalent) at the same base (i.e., ANG, AFRC, and active duty) must have different
          WWID codes. When needed, request additional ―base‖ codes from HQ 754
          ELSG/ILM, Gunter Annex, Maxwell AFB, AL.
          10.5.1.1.2. The third and fourth characters designate the unit or shop by using
          unique/distinguishable characters. To ensure tool rooms have unique identifiers,
          wings (or equivalent) must ensure other units within the same wing or PAS code do
          not duplicate the first 4 characters of the EID.
      10.5.1.2. The unit establishes the remaining five characters (any combination of
      numbers/letters) for CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment identification.
      10.5.1.3. Units must place the 9-digit EID on all CTKs, tools not assigned to a box, and
      dispatch-able equipment that is of sufficient size. The 9-digit EID must be placed on the
      outside of dispatchable CTKs. Tools located inside the tool box may be marked with less
      than 9-digits but must contain the 4-digit WWID and identifying character(s) that ties the
      tool back to the CTK. For example, tools inside an assigned dispatchable CTK
      ―U6JG00001‖ may be marked ―U6JG1.‖ Units may affix non-metallic bar code labels on
      tools to prevent re-etching as long as the use of the tool and its work environment does
      not normally result in excessive damage to the label making it unreadable. Tools will be
      marked with the most current EID. All previous CTK identifiers will either be removed
      or marked out (this does not include PMEL markings).
244                             AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


          10.5.1.3.1. Small tools or items that cannot be marked as described above (such as
          drill bits, allen wrench sets, apexes, etc.) are to be maintained in a container marked
          with the WWID and an identifying character(s) that ties the tool back to the CTK
          along with the number of tools contained. The container is counted as one of the
          items.
       10.5.1.4. MXG/CCs may require use of the EID and AFTO Form 65 (metallic)/AFTO
       Form 66 (non-metallic) for TMDE routinely (i.e., once per week) dispatched from a
       workcenter or use of the AFTO Form 65/66 alone. For items that physically or
       mechanically check tolerances that require calibration, do not etch, or stamp in any
       manner that will affect calibration or the ability to calibrate. If marking is in question, the
       owning workcenter shall consult PMEL.
  10.5.2. Permanently mark (by etching or other means) grease guns, dispensing cans, spray
  bottles, pump oilers, and similar containers with the type of grease, fluid, or other liquids and
  military specification (MILSPEC) of the contents. If no MILSPEC exists, mark the item with
  the manufacturer’s name, part number/NSN from the applicable MSDS. Keep hoses and
  fittings separate for each type of grease. Note: If containers are used to hold or apply
  substances classified as hazardous materials, ensure labeling requirements of AFI 90-821, 29
  CFR 1910.1200(f), and local directives are accomplished.
  10.5.2. (AETC) Mark grease gun fittings and hoses with the type of grease they contain if
  they will be used on a different gun.
  10.5.3. Fiberglass handled hammers are etched IAW TO 32-1-101.
  10.5.4. CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment that may possess a unique serial/tracking
  number must be marked with an EID number. If the item cannot be marked, etched, or
  stamped, annotate the additional designator on the CTK contents list. TMDE will be marked
  with an EID and/or AFTO Form 65/66 bar code number for tracking purposes in TAS.
  10.5.5. Items that are assembled and are not intended to be disassembled during use, require
  only one mark/etch/stamp and one entry in the MIL (e.g., scribes, flashlights, grease guns,
  feeler gauges).
  10.5.6. Remove the EID from unserviceable tools and tools removed from the CTK (with the
  exception of warranty tools where removal of EID would void the tool warranty) and update
  TAS and the MAJCOM/locally generated form or hard copy MIL accordingly. Procedures to
  tag/segregate unserviceable warranty tools will be addressed IAW para 10.2.1.3
  10.5.7. For ALC: Tools, common accessories, support equipment and CA/CRL equipment
  issued individually or part of a tool kit will be marked prior to issue with the center code (see
  Table 10.1) and a number identifying it to the proper tool issue center, Production Support
  Center (PSC) or back shop. Small tools or items that cannot be marked as described above
  (such as drill bits, allen wrench sets, apexes, etc.) are to be maintained in a container marked
  with the TK ID number and an identifying character(s) that ties the tool back to the TK along
  with the number of tools contained. The container is counted as one of the items.

10.6. Locally Manufactured, Developed, or Modified Tools and Equipment. All locally
manufactured, developed, or modified tools and equipment used on aerospace equipment must
be approved by the MXG/CC (Planning and Engineering Office for ALC) or their designated
representative. This procedure does not apply to local manufacture, modification or design of
tools authorized in specific technical data. QA coordinates on all requests for approval and use of
locally designed tools or equipment. Users will review items and requirements biennially (every
two years) for applicability and current configuration. See Chapter 8 of this instruction for
additional guidance. Note: Weapons loading, maintenance and armament systems flight locally
designed equipment must be coordinated through the WWM and meet the following
requirements.
   10.6.1. LME, if not included in tech data or listed on the MMHE Focal Point web site
   (https://peonet.eglin.af.mil/mmhe/ ) managed by the MMHE Focal Point, 615 Apalachicola
   Road, Suite 101, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6845.
       10.6.1.1. Munitions/armament LME is specialized equipment designed to interface with
       or support munitions or armament suspension equipment such as tools, handling dollies,
       storage racks, maintenance stands, transport adapters, etc. All munitions/armament LME
       contained on the MMHE Focal Point web site meets applicable AFOSH, explosive
       safety, and USAF standards, and is approved for local manufacture and use at unit level
       AF-wide. Drawing packages for these items are available to the unit via the MMHE
       Focal Point web site. Units must use MMHE Focal Point-designed munitions/armament
       LME for new procurements if a design exists and fills the requirement.
       10.6.1.2. Munitions/armament LME, specifically designed to interface with or support
       munitions, which is not contained in technical data or on the MMHE Focal Point web site
       (i.e., hardened/protective aircraft shelter missile racks, Y-stands, munitions chocks,
       specialized tools, etc.) must be coordinated at unit level and forwarded to the MAJCOM
       Functional Manager for coordination/evaluation. If the MAJCOM Functional Manager
       determines the item has AF utility, the drawings shall be forwarded to the MMHE Focal
       Point for evaluation/ approval prior to formal development and placement onto the
       MMHE Focal Point web site. Munitions/armament LME, not designed to interface with
       or support munitions, which are not contained in technical data or on the MMHE Focal
       Point web site, must be approved at the unit level. Units are encouraged to forward any
       such approved LME for possible inclusion on MMHE Focal Point web site by sending an
       approved drawing package to the MAJCOM Functional Manager for
       coordination/evaluation. If the MAJCOM Functional Manager determines the item has
       additional AF utility, the drawing package shall be forwarded to the MMHE Focal Point
       for evaluation/approval prior to formal development and placement onto the MMHE
       Focal Point web site.
       10.6.1.2. (AETC) HQ      AETC/A4MSW        is    the    approving     authority   for
       munitions/armament LME, specifically designed to interface with or support munitions.
       This includes tools or equipment that measure, test, or verify system, subsystem,

       component, or item integrity. Changes or modifications to items previously approved by
       MAJCOM must be coordinated at unit level and forwarded to HQ AETC/A4MSW for
       approval. If applicable, HQ AETC/A4MSW will submit new LME requests to the HQ
       AETC Explosives Safety Division (HQ AETC/SEW) and the Non-nuclear Munitions
       Safety Board for evaluation. Use the following procedures for new LME requests
       requiring HQ AETC/A4MSW approval:
           10.6.1.2.1. (Added-AETC) The flight or section chief will submit a memorandum
           to HQ AETC/A4MSW through the maintenance operations officer or superintendent,
           QA and wing safety.
           10.6.1.2.2. (Added-AETC) Include a description of the test equipment and for what
           it is used.
           10.6.1.2.3. (Added-AETC) Include a list of materials.
           10.6.1.2.4. (Added-AETC) Include the approximate cost (including labor and
           material).
           10.6.1.2.5. (Added-AETC) A wiring diagram and views of the completely
           assembled unit with wiring visible (if applicable).
       10.6.1.3. All LME must meet applicable AFOSH, explosive safety, and USAF standards.
       All equipment designated for use with nuclear weapons test and handling must meet
       requirements in AFI 91-103.
       10.6.1.4. All LME must be maintained and inspected for serviceability on a regular basis
       IAW appropriate 00-20 series and 35D-1-2, Miscellaneous Munitions Handling and
       Support, technical data. AFTO IMT 244, or equivalent, must be maintained for all LME
       items (racks, stands, adapters, etc.). Equipment without technical data must, as a
       minimum, be inspected every 180 days for corrosion, physical defect, and lubrication as
       required.
10.6. (AETC) Locally      Manufactured,     Developed,    or    Modified     Tools     and
Equipment. Tools or equipment altered from their original design will be treated as locally
manufactured, developed or modified tools and equipment.         The biennial review of
munitions/armament locally manufactured equipment (LME) items requires QA and wing safety
coordination/evaluation.
10.7. Tool Room Operations and Security. Limit tool issue sections to no more than one per
work center/AMU. Establish procedures to ensure custodial control. Set up tool rooms to ensure
accountability. Process reports for tools that are lost, damaged, or destroyed, due to neglect IAW
AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey For Air Force Property.
   10.7.1. The tool room/tool issue center/PSC must be capable of being locked and afford
   protective measures such as monitoring, 24-hour coverage, or controlled key access. Tool
   issue center/PSC supervisor authorizes access to tool rooms for ALC only. When all
   CTKs/TKs are not capable of being secured in the tool room/tool issue center/PSC, the
   section NCOIC/Tool issue center/PSC supervisor will design a process to prevent the
   unauthorized use or access to tools and equipment. Due to space and facility limitations, it
   may not be possible to store oversized tool kits in the tool room/tool issue center/PSC.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 247


      10.7.1.1. Tool kit locks will be used to provide a physical barrier to opening the
      container lid, drawer or door and prevent the unauthorized removal of tools. Locks are
      not required on tools and equipment that are stored within secured tool rooms or work
      centers.
      10.7.1.2. Dispatchable tools, equipment, and CTKs/TKs are required to be locked and/or
      secured when left unattended. Tools and equipment are never secured to the exterior of
      an aircraft. Tool kits located within the controlled movement area are required to be
      locked when unattended and not in use, but do not need to be secured to another object.
          10.7.1.2.1. Alert aircraft in protection level 1 or 2 areas and ASA aircraft in PL-3
          areas: CTKs in these areas directly supporting alert aircraft do not have to be locked
          when unattended and not in use as long as they are inventoried at the beginning of
          each shift, after each maintenance task, and at the end of each shift.
      10.7.1.3. Modifications to tool containers are authorized unless modification voids the
      manufacturer’s warranty.
      10.7.1.4. CTK/Tool issue centers/PSCs will not issue tools individually from
      dispatchable CTK/TKs. When a recurring need exists for common tools to be issued
      individually, e.g., hammers, screwdrivers, pliers, drills, wrenches to perform routine,
      housekeeping or facility tasks within the work center, add the tools to a CTK/TK.
10.8. Lost Item/Tool Procedures.
   10.8.1. Supervisors ensure all assigned personnel are familiar with lost tool procedures. If an
   item/ tool or a portion of a broken tool is discovered missing, the following procedures apply:
      10.8.1.1. The person identifying the missing item/tool will search the immediate work
      area for the item/tool. If not found, after completing an initial search the individual will
      notify the expediter/ production superintendent/(First line supervisor for ALC) or
      equivalent.
          10.8.1.1.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) For non-aircraft/aircraft maintenance personnel:
              10.8.1.1.1.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Upon discovery, any item lost within
              aircraft control areas will be reported by the owner to the Maintenance Operations
              Center (MOC).
              10.8.1.1.1.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) MOC will execute the appropriate lost
              tool/item checklist to ensure all appropriate actions are taken and proper
              personnel are contacted for each situation.
          10.8.1.1.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Aircraft maintenance personnel will:
              10.8.1.1.2.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Immediately contact the MOC and a
              flightline expediter when a tool or item is suspected to be lost or missing.
              10.8.1.1.2.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) When a tool or item is suspected lost on an
              aircraft or piece of equipment, coordinate with a flight line expediter to place a
              Red X in the aircraft/equipment forms with a description of the tool or item and
              last known specific location.
              10.8.1.1.2.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) Conduct a thorough search for the lost tool
248                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


             or item. After accomplishing the search, if the tool or item is not found, the
             responsible individual will coordinate with the expediter to clear the
             aircraft/equipment forms.
             10.8.1.1.2.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) Initiate a lost tool report (AETC Form 138,
             Lost Tool or Item Investigation Record). Upon completion, submit the lost tool
             report to the QA office for tracking and trend analysis.
      10.8.1.2. Place a Red X in the aircraft or equipment forms of all affected aircraft or
      equipment with a description of the tool and a specific, last known, location of the tool.
         10.8.1.2.1. Aircraft/Equipment thought to contain a lost tool/item during the program
         depot maintenance process will be documented by initiating a Work Control
         Document and transferred to the aircraft forms as a Red X discrepancy at the point
         when the AFTO Form/IMT 781 or equipment forms are re-initiated
      10.8.1.3. Expediter/Production Superintendent/(First line supervisor for ALC) or
      equivalent will immediately notify the FLT CC/ Chief, support section, MOC, and QA.
      (Sq/CC and PSC Supervisor Center Tool Manager, Maintenance Control and QA for
      ALC).
      10.8.1.4. Initiate a thorough search for the tool.
      10.8.1.5. After a thorough search is completed and the tool is not found, the person
      issued the item/tool will initiate a lost tool report.
      10.8.1.5. (AETC) AETC Form 138, Lost Tool or Item Investigation Record, may be
      used to report the lost item. The report is routed through maintenance operations
      officer/maintenance superintendent to QA for filing.
      10.8.1.6. If at any time during the investigation the item/tool is found and retrieved,
      notify the FLT CC/Chief, support section, MOC, QA, expediter, Production
      Superintendent or equivalent, and the owning work center. (Maintenance SQ/CC and
      PSC Supervisor (if applicable) Center Tool Manager, Maintenance Control, QA, First
      Line Supervisor, or equivalent and the owning workcenter for ALC)
      10.8.1.7. If not found, the MOC/Maintenance Control will notify the MXG/CC
      (MXW/CC for ALC) of the missing item/tool.
      10.8.1.8. If the item is not located, MOO/MX SUPT (MX SQ/CC for ALC) shall
      determine when the search may be discontinued. Ensure documentation is accomplished
      IAW paragraph10.3.6.5 of this instruction.
         10.8.1.8.1. Limit authorization to clear Red X’s when a tool/item cannot be located
         to no lower than MOO/MX SUPT (MX SQ/CC or Deputy for ALC).
      10.8.1.9. When it is suspected that the item/tool has fallen into an inaccessible or
      unobservable aircraft area, perform a NDI or use borescope equipment to locate the lost
      tool.
         10.8.1.9.1. If the item/tool is in an inaccessible area that poses no FOD threat and the
         action is to leave the item/tool in place, the x-ray (or equivalent) with the
         identification of the exact tool location and copies of all information concerning the
         lost tool are maintained in the aircraft historical file until the item/tool is recovered.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                          249


     10.8.1.10. If at any time during the investigation the item/tool is found, but is
     inaccessible, notify the FLT CC/Chief, support section, MOC, QA, expediter, Production
     Superintendent or equivalent, and the owning work center (Maintenance SQ/CC and
     Center Tool Manager, Maintenance Control, QA, First Line Supervisor, or equivalent and
     the owning workcenter for ALC).
        10.8.1.10.1. Operations Officer/MX SUPT may explore other possible actions to
        include having the unit or a DFT disassemble the aircraft to remove the item/tool.
        10.8.1.10.2. If the aircraft MDS is one that has a PDM or is scheduled for depot
        modification, the lost item/tool and location is listed in the AFTO IMT 345,
        Aerospace Vehicle Transfer Inspection Checklist and Certification, for removal by
        the depot.

                            MAINTENANCE SUPPLY SUPPORT

11.1. General. This chapter describes the general responsibilities and requirements of
decentralized supply support personnel, Maintenance Supply Liaison (MSL), AMU maintenance
Supply Support and work center supply management personnel. Lead Commands will identify
specific responsibilities and outline unique decentralized supply support operations in Lead
Command instructions when necessary. AF Program Action Directive (PAD) 08-01 makes the
establishment of MSLs a Lead Command option. AFMAN 23-110, provides supply policy and
procedures. Decentralized supply support personnel and MSL will follow the guidance outlined
in AFMAN 23-110. Note: The AF has transitioned to a Global Logistics Support Center (GLSC)
concept. The GLSC provides fleet wide supply support to all AF weapon systems and leverages
consolidated repair facilities and ALC capability to optimize air frame availability.
11.1. (AETC) General. LRS/CC may decentralize the MSL capability to physically reside
with aircraft maintenance except at Altus Laughlin, and Randolph AFBs where the MSL
function is assigned to aircraft maintenance.
11.2. Maintenance Supply Liaison (MSL) Section. The MSL monitors the overall
maintenance and supply interface, resolves supply support problems, review reports and
coordinates supply related training needs for decentralized supply support personnel. MSL
personnel are authorized on the LRS UMD and report to the LRS/CC. MXG/CC with the
MSG/CC may decentralize the MSL capability to physically reside with MXG. The LRS/CC
through the MSL, is the liaison between maintenance units and the AFGLSC. If Lead Commands
do not establish the MSL function, the LRS, Materiel Management Flight, Customer Support
Section, will accomplish MSL duties. (See AFMAN 23-110 Vol 2 Chapter 2 for further
instructions)
11.3. Decentralized supply support. The LRS/CC is responsible for providing supply support
to maintenance activities and will decentralize supply personnel and parts to the maximum extent
possible. Decentralized supply support personnel are authorized on the MXG UMD and report to
maintenance activities. These personnel coordinate maintenance and supply actions, manage
supply transactions for their assigned maintenance activity, monitor and track assets in the repair
cycle, resolve supply support problems and report aircraft parts status to maintenance
supervision. They assist maintenance in processing requisitions, researching sources of supply,
completing DD Form 1348-6, DoD Single Line Item Requisition System Document, entering
manual requisitions (part number only), updating exception code lists, and other peculiar
maintenance supply problems.
   11.3.1. Supply Discipline. Supply discipline is the responsibility of all military and civilian
   employees regardless of grade or position. Supervisors at all levels ensure the practice of
   good supply discipline. Train all maintenance personnel to perform supply duties related to
   their job to include AFI 23-111, Management of Government Property in Possession of the
   Air Force, guidance.
11.4. Ordering Parts. Order aircraft parts from supply through MIS/ILS-S interface. Monitor
supply status on all backordered parts. Request supply assistance if status is unacceptable.
Technicians ordering parts:
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                              251


   11.4.1. Provide required data to facilitate the issue request. See AFMAN 23-110.
   11.4.2. Complete AF Form 2413 or AF IMT 2005, Issue Turn-In Request or locally
   developed electronic log, and include the supply document number and time ordered, or use
   printouts of requests made via the supply interface in lieu of AF Form 2413 or AF IMT 2005
   or locally developed electronic log.
   11.4.3. Order parts for transient aircraft IAW AFMAN 23-110 and TO 00-20-1,. Use
   demand code "N" (non-recurring) for transient aircraft requests. Use demand code "R"
   (recurring) if the item is for a base assigned aircraft or for regularly scheduled transient
   flights.
      11.4.3.1. Promptly process repairable items since the repairable item may be the only
      part available.
      11.4.3.2. Assign a valid supply delivery priority to each demand IAW AFMAN 23-110 .
      11.4.3.3. Cancel erroneous requests.
      11.4.3.4. Use the force activity designators (FAD) code with the UND to set the
      requisition priority. When supporting a unit with a higher FAD, use the FAD of the
      supported unit.
      11.4.3.5. Ensure proper use of UJCs.
      11.4.3.6. Verify and monitor backordered requests to prevent unwarranted mission
      limiting conditions, CANNs, priority abuses and wasted money.
      11.4.3.7. Recycle reusable containers and metals.
      11.4.3.8. Turn in excess supply parts and materiel.
      11.4.3.9. Process TRN to record usage of an item and ensure proper stockage.
      11.4.3.10. Track DIFMs. DIFM inputs are critical to recording and getting credit for
      proper repair cycle times. DIFM status codes are currently broken down into three
      categories; delayed maintenance time, repair time, and AWP time. Repair time is the only
      time recorded and used to determine the number of assets LRS can stock. Not using the
      proper codes when they change, reduces the number of assets on base. DIFMs should be
      reduced to as near zero as possible since credit is not given for delayed maintenance or
      AWP time.
      11.4.3.11. Ensure the SPD approves the local purchase of all aircraft parts. Purchase
      aircraft parts IAW AFI 64-117.
11.4. (AETC) Ordering Parts. Requisition T-1, T-6, T-38C and C-21 CLS-furnished spares
(e.g., COMBS) according to the contract.
11.5. Processing. Process the MICAP start in Mission Capable Asset Sourcing System
(Enterprise Solution-Supply (ES-S) and coordinate with the MSL to upgrade, downgrade
and cancel MICAP requirements.
11.6. Readiness Spares Package (RSP) Review. Maintainers have a critical role in the annual
RSP review process. This role includes active maintenance participation in the base level
validation process conducted by the LRS and their MAJCOM during the annual RSP pre-review
 252                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


process in preparation for the ALC/SPD final review. Close maintenance-supply collaboration is
essential to ensure RSPs are properly sized to support contingency maintenance requirements.
11.7. Bench Stock. Work center supervisors determine the contents of their bench stock.
Examples of bench stock items include: nuts, bolts, cotter keys, washers, resistors, capacitors,
light bulbs, sealants and batteries. Bench stock levels are managed and based predominantly on
consumption. See AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 2, Chapter 11 for specific requirements for
managing bench stock levels.
   11.7.1. Mark bins containing 50 percent or less of the authorized quantity to facilitate
   monthly inventories. Do not include items coded TCTO, unacceptable for AF use, critical,
   classified or sensitive in bench stocks. Refer to AFMAN 23-110 for exception data.
   11.7.1. (AETC) For CLS bench stock, flag a bin when the bin quantity reaches 50 percent
   or less and notify the CLS function when an out-of-stock condition exists in the bench stock.
   11.7.2. Maintain environmentally sensitive items in their original container. If removed from
   original container, place items in a sealed package and clearly mark them to prevent
   misidentification and misuse (e.g., seals, desiccant, filters, circuit cards, sealants).
   11.7.3. Remove unidentifiable items, or items whose serviceability is unknown, from bench
   stock bins and process them as shop scrap through DRMO.
   11.7.4. Control and secure any precious metals displayed. Dispose of property containing
   precious metals IAW AFMAN 23-110.
   11.7.5. Set up fixed or mobile bench stocks to provide quick and easy access to bits and
   pieces needed to support maintenance efforts. Ensure mobile bench stocks do not present a
   FOD hazard.
   11.7.5. (AETC) Obtain items from an established bench stock. Only items essential to
   launch and recover aircraft are authorized. Quantities of items on trucks should not exceed a
   10-day supply. Each bin must have a locally devised label that includes the stock number,
   bench stock line number (document number) and quantity authorized in the truck bin.
   11.7.6. Identify and control the issue and turn-in of hazardous materiel/items on bench stock
   listings.
   11.7.7. (Added-AETC) Items purchased using the Government Purchase Card (GPC) may
   be located near or adjacent to bench stock, but not mixed. GPC purchases are governed by
   AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-Wide Purchase Card (GPC) Program, and AFMAN 23-
   110. The following provisions apply:
       11.7.7.1. (Added-AETC) Develop a readily identifiable method to distinguish between
       items purchased using GPC and items procured through supply; for example, distinctive
       colored labels (with GPC in bold letters), bin locations, or place in a segregated area.
       Labels will also contain the nomenclature, authorized quantity and bin location number.
       11.7.7.2. (Added-AETC) Mark or flag bins containing GPC items for repurchase using
       the same procedures as supply-procured items to maintain consistency and prevent out-
       of-stock conditions,
       11.7.7.3. (Added-AETC) Perform reviews of locally purchased items in conjunction
       with normal bench stock reviews to identify any needed adjustments.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                  253


11.8. Consumable Readiness Spares Package (CRSP). The CRSP concept allows MAJCOMs
to use either Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) or In-place Readiness Spares Package
(IRSP) details to manage consumable item support for contingency deployments. The CRSP
process provides requirement and asset visibility, has automated transfer and deployment
procedures, has the capability to provide the correct priority and project-coded replenishment
requisitions, and eliminates redundant requirements. Refer to AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 2,
Chapter 26 for detailed CRSP procedures and options. The CRSP procedures provide
MAJCOMs with a standard process to support consumable item wartime requirements.
11.9. Shop Stock. Includes gas cylinders, random length bar stock, sheet metal, plastic, fabric,
electrical wire, and similar items not normally included in bench stocks. Maintain shop stock for
day-to-day operations. Monitor shop stock to prevent materials from becoming excessive or
outdated. Shop stock should not normally exceed 90 days usage, or the unit of issue or unit pack,
whichever is greater. Store shop stock near/adjacent to bench stock items, if practical, but do not
mix them together. Clearly identify materials as ―Shop Stock‖ and label them with noun, national
stock number or part number, unit of issue, and shelf-life, if applicable.
   11.9.1. (Added-AETC) Store work center hazardous materials in a centralized location.
   Hazardous materials must be returned to the centralized location at the end of each shift to
   ensure accountability.
11.9. (AETC) Shop Stock. Items such as safety wire and solder routinely used at a work
station may be maintained at the work station. (Note: This does not include hardware such as
nuts, bolts and screws (aircraft or equipment parts).) Work center supervisors will establish an
inventory list that identifies what items are kept at each workstation to ensure accountability.
11.10. Operating Stock. Includes connector dust covers, hydraulic line caps/plugs, and similar
items that are normally recovered after use and re-used. Store operating stock near/adjacent to
bench stock items, if practical, but do not mix them together. Monitor operating stock to prevent
it from becoming excessive or outdated. Retain partially used bench stock items in bench stock
and not in operating stock. Identify, tag, and turn in items with no forecasted use IAW AFMAN
23-110. Clearly identify items as ―Operating Stock‖ and label them with noun, national stock
number or part number (if applicable), unit of issue, and shelf-life, if applicable.
11.11. Work Order Residue. Includes expendable bit/piece items left over from maintenance
work orders or bench stock deletions. Store work order residue near/adjacent to bench stock
items, if practical, but do not mix them together. Ensure excesses are consolidated for turn-in to
LRS at least annually. Clearly identify items as ―Work Order Residue‖ and label them with
noun, national stock number or part number, unit of issue, and shelf-life, if applicable. Control
all work order residues used on or around aircraft, uninstalled engines, and AGE.
11.12. Adjusted Stock Levels. Adjusted levels are used when the demand level or consumption
is inadequate to support the requirement. A single occurrence of a mission limiting status is not
sufficient reason to establish an adjusted stock level. It may indicate a need to review demand
data for accuracy. Use AF IMT 1996, Adjusted Stock Level, to request adjusted supply levels for
support of special projects, special operating requirements, or if existing demand data is
insufficient to support mission requirements. Work centers, with assistance from supply
personnel, must prepare the AF IMT 1996 and route it through MOO/MX SUPT for review prior
to sending to LRS Customer Service Section. See AFMAN 23-110 for criteria and procedures to
submit these requests. Prior to submitting to LRS, ensure the AF IMT 1996 contains adequate
 254                             AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


justification and is approved by the MXG/CC. Examples of adequate justification include:
seasonal materiel requirements, long lead-time items, unserviceable components forcing a ―no
fly‖ or NMC condition for extended periods of time and fleet-wide versus single aircraft impacts.
Work centers must maintain a master file of adjusted stock levels and must follow-up on
requests. Supply personnel and the appropriate work center must accomplish a validation of
adjusted stock levels according to AFMAN 23-110.
11.13. Shelf life Items. Work centers control shelf life items in bench stock, operating/shop
stock and work order residue IAW AFMAN 23-110. LRS identifies shelf life items by use of
shelf life codes; units will identify shelf life in bench, shop, operating stocks and work order
residue by using colored/highlighted bin labels. This label contains the item's shelf life code and
source of the code. Contact the LRS supply inspector to determine if shelf life conflicts exist
between the various sources. Check expiration dates on issued items and do not accept outdated
items from supply. Do not open shelf life containers until needed and use the oldest items first.
Shelf life materials stored in other than original containers must be marked with original shelf-
life expiration codes. Recycle, reclaim, or turn-in for disposal, shelf life items which are loose in
the bin and expiration dates cannot be determined IAW Type I shelf life criteria IAW AFMAN
23-110. Inspect Type II shelf life items IAW AFMAN 23-110.
11.14. Equipment Items. Continually review equipment items needed for mission
accomplishment. LRS personnel assist equipment custodians in researching and preparing
documents for gaining authorizations and ordering equipment items. Equipment custodians
request equipment, tools and bench mock-ups, using AF IMT 601, Equipment Action Request,
or AF IMT 2005. LRS provides equipment custodians a CA/CRL listing all authorized and in-
use equipment for each account. Check the appropriate Allowance Standard for authorizations,
and verify that the correct SRDs are loaded. See AFMAN 23-110 for procedures on appointing
equipment custodians, setting up the proper accounts, ordering, and maintaining equipment
items. Organizational equipment custodians must work through LRS to obtain a loan agreement
from the Command Equipment Management Office prior to loaning organizational equipment to
another installation IAW AFMAN 23-110. Accountable equipment custodians must notify LRS
Equipment Accountability Office of deploying or scheduled to deploy equipment IAW AFMAN
23-110. Ensure compliance with capitalized equipment procedures IAW AFMAN 23-110.
11.15. Special Purpose Recoverable Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM). SPRAM assets
are fault isolation spares, shop standard spares, training spares, Dash-21 TO spares
(AME), test station spares, and stand alone spares. These assets are Expendability,
Recoverability, Repairability Code (ERRC) XD/XF items, which are controlled and managed as
in-use supplies. Review all SPRAM authorizations annually and certify as valid. Annotate
review on the R25 listing. A SPRAM monitor and custodian are appointed to manage these
assets. The program was developed to provide AF maintenance leaders an automated system to
maintain visibility and accountability for recoverable spares being used for other than their
primary mission and that are not being reported through any other system. (Ref: AFMAN 23-110
and AFI 21-103).
11.16. Supply Assets Requiring Functional Check, Calibration, or Operational Flight
Programming. Maintenance sections must identify items requiring functional checks,
calibration, or operational flight programming prior to use by preparing a list of items, (including
the repair section's organization and section code) and sending the list through the Flight/CC or
flight/section NCOIC or AMU OIC/SUPT (if applicable) and MOO/MX SUPT to the LRS chief
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                  255


inspector. This list shall be updated/ validated IAW AFMAN 23-110. Supply issues the items
using procedures in AFMAN 23-110 to repair sections when functional checks, calibration, or
programming is due or when serviceability is doubtful. If a part issues requiring a functional
check, ensure it is not restricted in the weapon system Dash-6 TO. Do not use an aircraft as a test
bed for parts. Refer to TO 00-20-3 for functional check and frequency requirements.
11.17. Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) Kit Procedures. TCTO kit management
is a joint maintenance and supply responsibility IAW TO 00-5-15 and AFMAN 23-110. TCTO
managing agencies initiate requests for kits, parts and tool requirements (See Chapter 7 of this
instruction for additional information). Transfer TCTO kits with aircraft or equipment. Retain
TCTO kits for aircraft returning to the unit for TCTO compliance. AFMAN 23-110, TO 00-5-15,
and TO 00-5-1 contain detailed guidance for the transfer of TCTO kits.
11.18. Supply Points. Establish supply points within individual work centers when time or
resources required to move items dictate a need. Storage space for the supply points is provided
by the supported work center. Determine management of the supply point by agreement between
the group commanders. Supply points must be reconciled semi-annually by the work center
supply point monitor and the results of the reconciliation are provided to the LRS Supply Point
Manager. Supply points are inventoried annually IAW AFMAN 23-110. Establishment of an
aircraft parts store and/or FSC within the maintenance complex reduces the dependence on
supply points and or bench stocks. LRS maintains warehouses in both these facilities, stocking
assets closer to the point of use. Expenditure of funds and manpower may be reduced by use of
these facilities.
11.19. Local Manufacture. Units publish directives outlining procedures covering the
manufacture of items source coded local manufacture. Include procedures that prevent abuses,
specify coordination requirements (e.g., QA) and approval authority. Local manufacturing is an
essential part of unit maintenance support. The applicable end-item TO identifies items subject to
local manufacture. Specific procedures are in AFMAN 23-110. When developing directives:
   11.19.1. Identify the approval authority for local manufacture requests.
   11.19.2. Requesters use an AF IMT 2005 for supply item local requests. Use an AF IMT 601
   for equipment requests. Provide a drawing, sample, technical data and DD Form 1348-6, as
   required. Obtain drawings from the base EDSC or Joint Engineering Data Management
   Information and Control System (JEDMICS). Use the AF engineering data program
   governed by AFI 21-401.
   11.19.3. Requesters coordinate with the appropriate fabricating section to determine the bits
   and pieces required to manufacture the item. The supply local manufacturer manager assists
   in verifying parts availability.
   11.19.4. Requesters identify all sections that have action on the AFTO Form 350 for items
   requiring multiple section processing.
11.20. Production Scheduling. The repair section NCOICs establish a production schedule
based on priorities. LRS provides the repair cycle asset management listing (D23) to assist each
repair section in this effort. The D23 is provided in both maintenance location and stock number
sequence. Repair sections use the D23 to manage the flow of unserviceable DIFM assets in the
repair cycle and to ensure the DIFM status and location is updated.
 256                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


11.21. Control of AWP Assets and Cross-CANN. Closely control reparable assets in AWP
status. Do not consolidate storage areas for AWM and AWP assets. Group commanders
negotiate storage of out-sized units. Provide the supply AWP manager the DIFM document
number of the AWP end item and the due-out document numbers of bits and pieces to adjust
supply data base records for cross-CANN actions. Supply requisitions, and monitors the status of
repair bits and pieces. Repair section asset managers identify unacceptable supply status impacts
to the LRS AWP Monitor. Supply requests disposition for assets with unavailable repair parts.
Only dispose of parts on receipt of disposition authority.
11.22. Repair Cycle Assets. Decentralized Supply Support (DSS) personnel will monitor the
status of repair cycle assets. Process repair cycle assets IAW TO 00-20-3. Units establish local
procedures for the control of repair cycle assets throughout the maintenance cycle. Include
methods of accounting for all components and accessories, procedures for control of assets in
AWP or AWM status, and procedures and responsibilities for cross CANN, removal of bits and
pieces, and scheduling and control of repair cycle assets. Promptly process, repair, and return
repairable components to the repair cycle support element. Repair assets to the fullest extent
authorized within unit capabilities.
   11.22.1. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)/XB3 Turn-In. Place EOQ/XB3 pick-up point
   containers in or near each maintenance work center to encourage turn-in of unneeded items.
   Make the containers easily accessible and visible. Work center supervisors periodically
   inspect containers for unauthorized items. AFMAN 23-110 contains detailed procedures.
   11.22.2. The requisitioning and control of TCTO kits until issued, is a supply process
   managed within the LRS Flight Service Center Element.
11.23. DIFM. Repair sections use the D23 to manage the flow of unserviceable DIFM assets in
the repair cycle and to update DIFM status and location of unserviceable assets. If a parts request
is backordered and the unserviceable DIFM item does not limit or restrict the operational
capability of the end item, remove it and send it to the applicable support section for either
repair, NRTS approval, or condemnation with a subsequent turn-in to LRS (as a credit DIFM)
IAW TO 00-20-3. The D23 will not be used to manage serviceable assets.
11.24. Tail Number Bins (TNB). Establishment and management of TNBs is a maintenance
responsibility. TNBs are storage locations established and controlled to store issued parts
awaiting installation and parts removed to FOM. TNBs are set up by tail number, serial number,
or identification number. Once the part is issued, the aircraft parts store informs the MOC and
Flightline expediter (for MICAPs) or the PS&D (for backordered items) that the part is in. Do
not release parts from the TNB without proper documentation. Return items removed from the
TNB that are not installed that duty day. Inform the Production Superintendent or Flightline
expediter of TNB assets, which may prevent or satisfy a mission-limiting condition. TNB items
used to satisfy MICAP conditions are not CANNs. Reorder these items and notify the expediter
of the new document number. Update the aircraft forms and the MIS. If supply creates a due-out
prior to transfer of these items, notify decentralized supply support to change the "mark-for" field
on the due-out detail. Seal and store partially completed TCTO kits and parts in the TNB and
mark the container or package with the tail number, serial number, or equipment identification
number and TCTO number. Maintain security and control of TNB assets. Track property placed
in the TNB by tail number, serial number, or equipment identification number. For each entry
indicate:
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 257


   11.24.1. Date received
   11.24.2. Noun
   11.24.3. Document number
   11.24.4. Status (FOM, issue/due-out release (ISU/DOR), TCTO, etc.)
   11.24.5. Removal information (date, time, signature, and employee number of the person
   who picked up the property)
   11.24.6. Remarks
11.25. CANN actions. See section 14.8 for CANN procedures and responsibilities.
11.26. Bench Check and Repair Policy. Maintenance sections bench check items as part of
the on-equipment troubleshooting process. When workload requires, the section NCOIC
determines the priority for bench check actions. Specific procedures for bench check and repair
policy are provided in TO 00-20-3. The following general guidelines apply:
   11.26.1. Order required parts ―fill or kill.‖ If the part is not in stock and a MICAP condition
   exists, backorder the new request. Determine local repair capability before requisitioning off-
   base support or going lateral support.
   11.26.2. Remove the suspected item, fill out the AFTO Form 350, and annotate it as repair
   and return. Attach AFTO Form 350 to the item; place the item in the repair cycle; and
   annotate the name of the repair section on the form.
   11.26.3. Bench-check, repair, take NRTS action, or condemn the item. If the item is repaired
   or otherwise determined to be serviceable, the repair section informs the support section the
   item is available for pick-up so on-equipment maintenance action may resume. If the item
   cannot be repaired, the repair section informs the support section to initiate a backordered
   request and takes appropriate NRTS and condemnation action on the unserviceable asset.
11.27. Maintenance Turn-Around (TRN) Record Update Processing. Work centers
processing TRNs will ensure the AFTO Form 350, Part II, is processed using the supply
interface to the MIS. Verify each TRN with the D04. Use TRN procedures for all items repaired
and replaced.
11.28. Maintenance Turn-In to Supply. Work centers must properly tag and secure repair
cycle assets in their reusable container. The repair shop must comply with environmental control
requirements as specified in TOs, AFI 24-203, and place documentation with the container.
Include AFTO Form 350, Parts I and II, and a condition tag or label with all items turned into
supply. Enter the correct action taken code on AFTO Form 350, Part II. Accomplish proper
reclamation and demilitarization actions on condemned repair cycle assets.
11.29. Buildup Items. Maintain items requiring build-up prior to use (e.g., wheels and tires) in
supply points in a built-up configuration. Send items to appropriate work centers for build-up
and return them to the supply point for later issue. Use AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt,
or control log to control assets sent for build-up when the supply point is operated by supply.
Validate AF IMTs 1297 daily if over 10 days old. Establish local procedures to control assets
when maintenance operates the supply point and assets are sent to another organization for build-
up.
 258                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


11.30. Supply Reports and Listings. Use supply reports and listings to manage maintenance
requirements. Most are provided automatically or generated after supply transactions. Request
others when needed. Attachment 2 of this instruction lists the most common/important reports
and listings.
11.31. Deficiency Report (DR) Exhibits. DR exhibit procedures for issue, turn-in, and storage
are contained in TO 00-35D-54 and AFMAN 23-110. They shall be input into the Joint
Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS) at https://jdrs.mil/.
11.32. Work Center Supply Management.
   11.32.1. Maintain AF Form 2413 or AF IMT 2005, or a locally developed electronic log
   recording all parts ordered from LRS and verify status with the daily document register
   (D04), Priority Monitor, Report (D18) and the monthly due-out validation listing (M30) or
   use printouts of requests made via the supply interface in lieu of an electronic log, AF IMT
   2005, or AF Form 2413.
   11.32.2. Maintain source document audit trail accountability for all demands on supply.
   Ensure validity and completeness of supply requisition forms. Verify "UJC" and "SRD"
   codes.
   11.32.3. Maintain MICAP records and initiate follow-up actions on MICAP requisitions.
   11.32.4. Follow-up with supply personnel to resolve AWP problems.
   11.32.5. Establish procedures for controlling cross-CANN of reparable assets to reduce
   AWP units.
   11.32.6. Process supply items requiring a buildup before issue in a timely manner.
   11.32.7. Compile a list of items requiring functional check or calibration prior to installation.
   Review and update the list IAW AFMAN 23-110.
   11.32.8. Manage aircraft systems and equipment under 3LM. Compile a list of direct NRTS
   items in coordination with maintenance squadron back shops and AFREP representative and
   provide it to LRS for inclusion in the master direct NRTS listing. Review and update at least
   semiannually.
   11.32.9. Establish a storage area for reusable containers. Consolidation with other work
   centers is authorized.
   11.32.10. Schedule and control all repair cycle assets through the repair flights based on
   priority assigned.
   11.32.11. Move repairable assets from work center to work center in an expedient manner.
   Ensure the proper documentation and container accompany the asset through the repair cycle
   11.32.12. (Added-AETC) Reconcile IMDS and SBSS records by correcting mismatched
   records listed in the NFS540 Document Validation Report (DVR) contained in IMDS and
   explained in AFCSM 21-579 Vol 2. This report is required to maintain a smooth interface
   between Maintenance and Supply systems.
11.33. Maintenance Repair/Supply Delivery Priorities. Use the following to establish
maintenance repair priorities. Raising or lowering priorities will not necessarily require a

IREP program. IREP provides wing senior leadership a forum to evaluate current aircraft
weapons systems resource and support status, highlight specific problem areas, focus on local
repair initiatives to include the AFREP processes, and discuss ways to improve the overall repair
cycle process.
   11.34.1. IREP Meeting. The meeting will be held at least quarterly chaired by the WG/CC,
   WG/ CV or MXG/CC and organized by the MOF. Recommended participants include the
   following: LRS, FSC, representatives from maintenance units, O&M resource advisors,
   maintenance analysis, AFREP (if applicable), QA, and others as determined by the
   MXG/CC. The responsible asset manager should be the focal point to lead the discussion of
   the key data about a specific part.
       11.34.1.1. Subject Matter Review. One of the objectives of the IREP meeting is to
       increase overall base self-sufficiency for repair and reduce the overall cost of operations.
       Topics discussed vary based on local requirements, but should include key elements of
       asset management and costs associated with each of the maintenance stock fund
       divisions. The number of items reviewed in each topic is determined locally. Units
       determine the specific format and visual aids used for presentation of the following
       information:
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                            261


       11.34.1.1.1. Asset Profile/Top Projected MICAP Situations. An asset profile is an in-
       depth review of an asset identified as critical to mission accomplishment or that
       causes frequent MICAP situations. Data in an asset profile may include number
       authorized and on-hand, number repaired and not repaired, number of MICAPs,
       average repair cycle days, average AWP days, monthly demand, item cost, and
       financial value of assets in the repair cycle. The overall health of the assets should
       include reasons for MICAP situations and solutions to resolve them.
       11.34.1.1.1. (AETC) AETC Form 229, Intermediate Repair Enhancement Program
       Asset Profile, may be used to document the asset profile.
       11.34.1.1.2. Test Station Equipment Profile. Test station in-commission time is
       critical to efficient repair cycle output. TMDE and other shop deficiencies may have a
       negative effect on the base repair cycle process. The wing should focus on actions
       which maximize test station capability.
       11.34.1.1.3. Wing Self-Sufficiency Initiatives. Initiatives include discussion of new
       wing, group and squadron AFREP initiatives and other local self-sufficiency repairs.
       Discussions must include how initiative is crossfed to appropriate depot, Lead
       Command and all other like-MDS bases.
       11.34.1.1.4. High Cost Maintenance. Unit funded TCTOs/modifications, high cost
       work centers, SPRAM back orders, financial value of parts in the repair cycle, etc.
       11.34.1.1.5. Top CANN Items. Items with significant CANN histories. Review
       information which includes the number of times items were CANNed in the last 30
       days, average CANN occurrences over the last 6 months, projected get well date, and
       the time required to CANN the item.
       11.34.1.1.6. Unit Aircraft Engine Status Review. A status review summary should
       include number in work, projected production date, and supply drivers for work
       stoppage.
       11.34.1.1.7. Repair Cycle Bottlenecks. Review any area, which impedes the repair
       cycle process such as frozen supply records, supply, rejects, test station backlogs,
       personnel deficiencies, manpower shortages etc.
       11.34.1.1.8. AWP Summary. Analyze due-outs causes and back order priorities to
       determine if supply action is required to correct any deficiencies/problems.
       11.34.1.1.9. Repair Cycle Throughput. Throughput is the average time it takes to
       move individual items through the repair cycle. Review/compare the 12-month
       average versus the current month repair cycle time (RCT) to determine if progress is
       being made.
       11.34.1.1.10. Part Store Issue Effectiveness. Percentage of aircraft parts issued from
       the flightline part store vs. the main warehouse. Disregard this element when LRS
       does not segregate aircraft components into a separate warehouse.
       11.34.1.1.11. Discuss product improvement initiatives and maintenance related to
       Innovation Development through Employee Awareness (IDEA) submissions, etc..

         WING WEAPONS MANAGER AND WEAPONS STANDARDIZATION

12.1. Wing Weapons Manager (WWM). The WWM will be a 2W100 CMSgt assigned
directly to the MXG/CC. In units where 2W1 personnel are assigned but no 2W100
authorization exists, the MXG/CC will appoint the most qualified 2W1 to fulfill WWM
responsibilities outlined in this chapter. (ARC: the Senior Weapons Loading Supervisor serves
as the WWM and does not require assignment to the MXG/CC staff). The WWM is the wing's
focal point for all weapons loading and armament systems related matters. The WWM's primary
efforts focus on compliance, continuity, and standardization. Weapons activities required to
support the generation of peacetime training sorties generally do not reinforce primary combat
skills. Therefore, the WWM plays a key role in ensuring that the unit is able to produce combat
loaded aircraft. The WWM is charged with providing technical and managerial advice to senior
leaders in matters of weapons loading and armament systems. The WWM coordinates with the
weapons sections, armament systems flight, wing weapons and tactics, the munitions flight, and
other unit agencies on weapons related matters. The WWM has the authority to cross group and
squadron functional lines. The WWM (will): Note: (ANG only) In cases where the function is
not represented by full time personnel, the MXG/CC shall appoint a full time representative. In
cases where a 2W100 Chief Master Sergeant is not assigned to the Maintenance Group, the
MXG/CC may request a waiver for the most qualified (2W1) SMSgt to serve as the WWM for
up to 24 months. Submit waivers to ANG/A4MW for approval.
   12.1.1. Is the functional manager for all 2W1X1 personnel. The WWM is the wing POC for
   all 2W1X1 manpower issues within the wing to include coordination on all manning,
   workcenter and organizational changes, AFSC changes, cross/retraining requests and
   waivers. The WWM informs the MAJCOM Armament functional manager of any proposed
   actions that may drive changes in unit manpower requirements (non applicable to ARC).
       12.1.1.1. In Wings where the Armament Systems Flight is organizationally aligned under
       a Munitions Squadron (MUNS), the Armament Systems Flight will organize, operate and
       perform duties and responsibilities per Chapter 5 of this instruction.
   12.1.2. Assign and balance 2W1X1 grades, experience and skill-levels between all 2W1X1
   work centers across the wing. Monitors PRP status of 2W1X1 personnel, if applicable.
   Rotate 2W1XX personnel between wing work centers (armament flight, weapons sections,
   WS, QA, etc.) as required to provide breadth of experience, promotion and job opportunities
   within the unit and 2W1 career field. Recommend all personnel be screened and considered
   for rotation at a maximum of every three years (non applicable to ARC). Ensure only
   individuals with the 2W1 AFSC (or equivalent contractor personnel) are certified/qualified to
   load/unload munitions items on aircraft (except for those qualification tasks specifically
   outlined in this AFI).
   12.1.3. Designate the Loading Standardization Crew (LSC), academic instructor, and lead
   crews. LSC Team Chief will be a 2W171 with a minimum grade of TSgt. Lead Crew Chief
   will be 2W171, with a minimum grade of TSgt if unit manning/personnel experience permits.
   Provide load crew training and certification program guidance and monitor implementation.
264                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


  12.1.3. (AETC) (Luke AFB) The wing weapons manager is authorized to designate a
  squadron lead crew to augment the load standardization crew (LSC) for the purpose of
  performing evaluations and certifications (including semi-annual evaluations) as required by
  this instruction.
  12.1.4. Inform the MXG/CC and affected SQ/CC and/or Operations Officer of any issues or
  problems affecting load crew status, Dual Loading Operations (DLO), projected manning,
  equipment, and other items of concern.
  12.1.5. Review the wing/squadron SORTs report prior to submission to the MAJCOM. Any
  equipment or load crew shortfalls which affect the wings C-rating in SORTS will be included
  and comments provided. Comments will provide reason, action taken and proposed get well
  dates for all 2W1 issues reported in SORTs. SORTS will be reported IAW AFI 10-201.
      12.1.5.1. In units where the AEF Reporting Tool (ART) is used, the WWM will review
      the ART for correct UTC status reporting.
  12.1.6. Monitor overall load crew status and advise the MXG/CC when the number of fully
  certified load crews falls below the UCML/TTML minimum. If this occurs and cannot be
  corrected within 30 days, the following information is sent by secure message, through the
  MXG/CC, to the appropriate MAJCOM 2W1XX functional manager. Note: All 2W1X1s
  working outside their respective workcenter or DAFSC will be qualified/certified if possible
  to fill load crew shortfalls before sending a message to the MAJCOM.
      12.1.6.1. Number of 2W1X1 personnel authorized and assigned by work center, skill
      level (primary AFSC) and grade for the entire wing. Include all work centers to which
      2W1X1 personnel are assigned.
      12.1.6.2. Number of 2W1X1 personnel working outside the AFSC/workcenter.
      12.1.6.3. Number of 2W1X1s not able to perform primary duties and the reason.
      12.1.6.4. Number of fully certified crews. Include corrective action, get well date, and
      30/60-day load crew status projection. If the standard cannot be reached in 60 days,
      provide the reason.
      12.1.6.5. Number of load crews formed but not fully certified. List crews and specific
      items for which they are not certified and qualified.
      12.1.6.6. Remarks: List limiting factors, equipment shortages, availability of training
      aircraft, etc.
  12.1.7. Annually review DOC Statements, OPLANs, UCML/TTMLs, unit tasked UTCs (for
  equipment and personnel) and UMD to identify any disconnects or problems. Coordinate
  changes and appendices with the wing weapons and tactics function and the munitions flight.
  Report any findings to MAJCOM.
      12.1.7.1. Quarterly validate and document wing 2W1XX UTC AEF taskings against
      existing/squadron DOCs. Specifically, WWM will ensure no shortfalls exist by aligning
      required skill level, grade, line remarks and CFETP qualifications against tasked UTCs to
      include AEF taskings for all assigned 2W1XX personnel. If a shortfall exists, WWM will
      immediately start an aggressive training program to eliminate shortfalls.
  12.1.8. Resolve scheduling conflicts affecting weapons loading and DLO training programs.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               265


  12.1.9. Provide input during development of local exercises involving weapons
  loading/armament functions, and serve as an advisor/evaluator to the wing exercise
  evaluation team.
  12.1.10. Ensure a recognition program for load crew and armament personnel is established.
  12.1.11. Ensure standardization of load crew CTKs by aircraft MDS to the maximum extent
  possible to provide interoperability of load crews. CTKs should contain all tools to
  accommodate common loading and maintenance functions. Weapons load crew CTK
  contents will be approved by the WWM. In coordination with the weapons section NCOIC
  and WS superintendent, determine the number of loading tool kits required in bomber units,
  and those that support only test, evaluation or training missions.
  12.1.12. Ensure sufficient quantities of serviceable load crew training munitions are
  available to support both load crew and DLO training programs. Review and validate all
  Munitions Forecasts submitted by WS and the Armament Flight prior to submission to
  MAJCOM.
     12.1.12.1. Training munitions: Authorized quantities of training munitions are posted in
     the ―Air Force Standard For Non-Expendable Air Munitions Training Authorizations‖
     maintained on the AF Portal, AF/A4MW Knowledge Now CoP. The standards are
     located in the policy folder/AFI 21-201/attachment 1.         These numbers reflect the
     maximum munitions required exclusively for weapons load crew certification and
     recurring training (WLT). These munitions are forecasted by and assigned to weapons
     load training (W1) accounts. Sortie generation and aircrew classroom training munitions
     must be forecasted for and maintained on separate supply accounts. Munitions required
     for DLO training must be forecasted on the unit sortie surge account.
     12.1.12.2. Units may request additional quantities of munitions than specified on these
     tables but will not be allocated munitions unless sufficient quantities are available to do
     so. The UCML/ TTML will be the source document for WLT munitions requirements
     and authorizations.
     12.1.12.2. (AETC) (Luke AFB) Luke AFB is authorized two AIM-7 missile load crew
     trainers for F-16 aircraft.
     12.1.12.3. Units with multiple MDS will only be authorized the minimum
     allocation/authorization of WLT munitions to facilitate load training on all MDS.
     Example: If a base has both F-15E and F-16 aircraft assigned and both MDS are tasked
     on the UCML/TTML for GBU-12 then only two, not four, GBU-12's will be allocated to
     support both MDS. If a situation exists where the WLT facilities are physically separated
     and the WWM determines it negatively impacts load crew training to move munitions
     from one to the other, then each facility will be authorized the minimum number of
     tasked training munitions.
  12.1.13. Ensure introductory training is provided to newly assigned personnel on aircraft
  familiarization, safe for maintenance, explosive safety, weapons release and gun systems
  maintenance prior to performing duties. Training, certification and qualification required to
  load munitions on aircraft are only provided by Weapons Standardization. All wing 2W1X1
  personnel regardless of duty position will receive initial and recurring weapons academics.
266                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


  12.1.14. Based on unit taskings, designate the number of load crews, other than the LSC and
  lead crews, to be certified on support or limited use munitions. In nuclear tasked units the
  WWM determines the number of load crews required to be certified on applicable nuclear
  weapons in support of Oplans, when the Oplans DOC does not dictate load crew
  requirements. Note: (ARC) The WWM Coordinates with the MXG/CC in determining the
  number of load crews to be certified on support or limited use munitions.
  12.1.15. Develop, in coordination with the explosive safety officer, airfield management,
  and Quality Assurance, a wing OI or supplement to this AFI for parking, launch and recovery
  of explosives-loaded aircraft, end of runway procedures, and to outline situations warranting
  impoundment of aircraft with hung ordnance or jammed gun systems. The OI or supplement
  must include requirements to:
      12.1.15.1. Arm and de-arm munitions-loaded aircraft in approved areas. Immediately-
      prior-to-launch and "safing" procedures may be performed in the aircraft parking area for
      contingencies, unit exercises, and daily training missions as quantity distance clearance
      allows with the approval of wing safety, airfield management and the MXG/CC.
      12.1.15.2. Establish procedures for inspecting and "safing" hung munitions or external
      stores before aircraft return to parking areas. Control access to aircraft until munitions are
      made safe and cause of hung stores is identified. As a rule, ensure aircraft guns and
      rockets are "safed" in the de-arm area before aircraft return to open ramp parking areas.
  12.1.16. Monitor weapons release/gun fire-out rates, malfunctions and corrective actions to
  assess weapons and armament systems reliability. Take appropriate action to resolve any
  problems and contact MAJCOM for assistance if required.
  12.1.16. (AETC) Provide performance levels, by squadron, to QA for inclusion in the
  MSEP summary, and if required, to PS&D for inclusion in monthly maintenance summaries.
      12.1.16.1. Weapons release reliability rates are calculated by dividing the number of
      successful releases by the number of attempts (Goal: 99%).
      12.1.16.2. The gun fire-out rate is calculated by dividing the number of successful bursts
      by the number attempted (Goal: 98%). Once a malfunction occurs, any further attempts
      for the purpose of clearing the malfunction should not be counted as attempts.
  12.1.17. Ensure compliance with local accountability procedures for AFI 36-2217 and AFI
  21-201. In conjunction with the weapons sections and munitions flight, develop a standard
  local format for the AF IMT 2434. A computer generated product may be used if it contains
  all required information.
  12.1.18. Coordinate with the MOO, munitions flight, weapons safety and operations plans in
  developing nuclear weapons operations procedures (e.g., convoy, custody transfer, no-lone-
  zone) if applicable.
  12.1.19. Ensure LME and MMHE meet the requirements outlined in Chapter 10 of this
  instruction.
  12.1.20. Conduct a wing weapons meeting monthly (quarterly for ARC) with representatives
  from WS, wing safety, quality assurance, munitions flight, armament flight, and the weapons
  sections to discuss and resolve any wing weapons issues, concerns or problems. Weapons
  AFETS are encouraged to attend.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                267

  12.1.23.3 (Added) to HQ AETC/A4MSW.
     12.1.23.1. Provide a valid document number and off-base requisition number for all
     items listed in AWP status in the remarks column of the report if the item is procured
     through USAF supply channels. If parts are obtained from commercial sources, and
     purchased using IMPAC card, provide source, date ordered, and status in the remarks
     column.
     12.1.23.2. (Added-AETC) Quantity of testers by part number, stock number, quantity
     authorized, quantity on hand, and quantity on order (including off-base requisition
     numbers). Identify status of each tester; for example, serviceable, unserviceable, AWM,
     AWP, etc. Include nomenclature, part number, stock number, and off-base requisition
     number for parts on order. Provide any appropriate remarks.
     12.1.23.3. (Added-AETC) AME, NIE, handling equipment, and other weapons or gun
     system support equipment assigned by equipment noun, quantity authorized, quantity on
     hand, quantity serviceable, quantity unserviceable, and remarks. Identify any significant
     difficulties associated with obtaining equipment, parts, or repairs. Note: Equipment is
     considered in commission if there are no discrepancies or parts required (to include
     TCTOs) that would hinder performance of the intended function. Equipment is not
     considered out of commission just because it is undergoing scheduled, preventative, or
     minor maintenance.
  12.1.24. Utilize and involve assigned Weapons AFETS in wing aircraft weapons and
  armament related issues and meetings IAW AFI 21-110.
  12.1.25. Inform the MAJCOM, within 24 hours, of any significant weapons or armament
  related issues such as dropped/hung munitions, equipment and aircraft release reliability or
  deficiency problems, and weapons safety or mishap issues.
     12.1.25.1. If a unit has an incident, it is important to preserve the evidence to the
     maximum extent allowable by operational requirements and safety. An example would be
     segregating an aircraft gun versus destroying it if it poses no immediate danger. This
     allows for evaluation of all the evidence and the ability to recreate the mishap conditions.
     12.1.25.2. If a malfunctioning munitions item (live or inert) causes a mishap refer to para
     9.7.4.
  12.1.26. See Chapter 7 of this instruction for information on Aircraft Generation Planning.

   12.1.27. Ensure at least two certified WS personnel are included on TDYs where live
   munitions will be expended and on deployments exceeding 30 days to provide MPRL and
   recertification capability. Note must be approved by the WWM
   12.1.28. Perform annual assessment on WS, weapons sections, armament flights, and 2W1
   personnel assigned to QA. Document findings and track corrective actions. Maintain copies
   of last two assessment results.
   12.1.29. WWM, with concurrence of MXG/CC, determines when armament flight personnel
   are required to perform load crew duties or related certifiable tasks.
   12.1.30. Determine need for a formal supervisory postload program (local option). If
   negative performance metrics, special missions, etc., warrant a supervisory postload
   program, WWM will establish procedures and a training program to ensure standardization
   between units. Supervisors (7-skill level minimum, expediters, shift supervisors, section
   NCOICs, etc.) performing such inspections require initial and recurring (not exceeding 15
   months interval) qualification training by WS. Training will be documented in either the
   WLCMT (or equivalent) or MIS, not on SCR. Document supervisory postload on AF IMT
   2430 (or equivalent).
   12.1.31. Ensure requirements for submitting AFTO IMT 375 on all weapons support
   equipment identified in TO 35-1-24 are accomplished. This process provides vital
   information and source documentation for ALCs to adequately reflect equipment sustainment
   costs, attrition rates, and to enable timely forecasting for replacement funding.
   12.1.32. (Added-AETC) Determine the tasks associated with ―Red X-limited‖ certification
   of AFSC 2W1XX personnel as it applies to the unit special certification roster and
   requirements of this publication.
   12.1.33. (Added-AETC) (Tyndall AFB only) Tyndall WWM will develop an OI or wing
   instruction in coordination with the AMU weapons section NCOICs and contractor
   armament function, to establish procedures for control and accountability of applicable NIE
   and AME and for in-shop handling/maintenance of jammed guns, gun systems and
   ammunition handling systems.
12.2. Weapons Standardization. The Weapons Standardization Section plans and conducts
both conventional and nuclear weapons load training to accomplish operational plans and
objectives. Initial and recurring load training, is crucial in maintaining a competent and
proficient certified nuclear and conventional force to meet both peacetime and wartime tasking.
WS is organized under the WWM and is comprised of the superintendent, the LSC, and lead
crews. An LSC may be formed for each MDS in multiple MDS units. One lead crew is normally
formed for each AMU, but additional crews can be formed as needed. Lead crews return to an
AMU for contingencies, deployments, generations and exercises. WS does not need to be formed
in organizations that do not load munitions requiring certification providing the requirements of
the weapons task qualification program are met, to include academic, practical, and recurring
training. In organizations such as this, the weapons function will be responsible for applicable
weapons manager responsibilities and the weapons task qualification program. In a wing, WS is
administratively assigned to the MOS but works directly for the WWM (NA for ARC).
   12.2.1. The key to successful combat/test/training operations is trained load crews proficient
   at generating aircraft configured to support combat and contingency plans. Units will
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                              269


  maintain at least the minimum number of required certified load crews (as specified on the
  UCML/TTML). Achieving this standard may require units to certify/qualify weapons
  personnel who may be assigned duties outside the weapons sections. Although assigned to
  support sections, resource advisor duties, etc., 2W1X1 personnel remain accountable for their
  primary load crew duties, will be managed accordingly, and are counted in wing 2W1X1
  manpower totals.
  12.2.2. WS Superintendent Responsibilities. The superintendent is responsible to the WWM,
  and performs section NCOIC duties outlined in Chapter 3 of this instruction. The
  superintendent develops and oversees the weapons standardization program, sets standards,
  develops local policies and procedures, and interprets all technical data and directives
  governing the weapons standardization program. The WS superintendent will: Note: (ARC
  & AFSOC) WS superintendent responsibilities may be performed by the LSC crew chief.
     12.2.2.1. Coordinate with the weapons section NCOICs to schedule crews for initial
     training, certification, minimum proficiency requirement loading (MPRL), and semi-
     annual evaluations (SAE) training. The WS superintendent will document monthly
     scheduling effectiveness (quarterly for ARC) and submit a summary letter for inclusion
     in the MSEP, including as a minimum:
         12.2.2.1.1. Load Crew Scheduling and Training Effectiveness (MPRL/SAE) (non
         applicable to ARC):
             12.2.2.1.1.1. Crews scheduled versus completed training events (non applicable
             to ARC).
             12.2.2.1.1.2. Passed versus failed evaluations.
             12.2.2.1.1.3. Problems/trends which detracted from scheduling and training.
     12.2.2.2. Coordinate with the PS&D to ensure availability of training aircraft.
     12.2.2.3. Manage WLT training munitions, components, and accessories by establishing
     a supply point with munitions (Munitions Operations) for conventional training
     munitions. WS will establish an equipment account for nuclear training weapons and
     accessories, if required. Document and schedule discrepancies requiring repair on
     training munitions through munitions control.
     12.2.2.4. Ensure load crew training munitions are maintained to the same standard as the
     parent munitions to the maximum extent possible. Training munitions must represent the
     parent munitions item in configuration, body color and mechanical function. Those
     having discrepancies, which affect safety, reliability, or detract from load crew training
     are not used.
         12.2.2.4.1. Load crew training munitions and components are inspected on a 180-day
         interval by the WS or more frequently if mandated by commodity TOs. Develop a
         formal agreement with the munitions flight concerning periodic inspection,
         maintenance, and refurbishment and forms documentation. An AFTO IMT
         244/Missile marriage record (or automated form) is maintained for each AUR
         training munition.
270                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


         12.2.2.4.2. AFTO IMT 244/Missile marriage record (and/or automated forms for
         training munitions only) are maintained by the WS and accompany the munition item
         when turned in for repair or scheduled inspection.
         12.2.2.4.3. An AFTO Form 350 accompanies munitions and munitions components
         when they are turned in to the munitions flight for repair.
      12.2.2.5. Use the guidelines established in AFI 21-201 when submitting the annual
      forecast to the MAJCOM.
      12.2.2.6. Order training munitions and munitions items to meet unit needs.
      12.2.2.7. If sufficient training munitions are not available to support DLO training,
      coordinate use of assigned items from WS supply point for management flexibility.
      12.2.2.8. Use the WLCMT, or equivalent program, to track load crew certification and
      qualification status. Unless computer systems are networked or modem-interfaced,
      printed products are produced and distributed at least twice each month to the weapons
      section NCOICs. Printed products are formatted so that manual updates can be made
      between issues. Monthly, generate a printed product, or electronic back-up copy, for WS
      records.
      12.2.2.9. Upon notification of a deployment or an increased state of alert, takes
      appropriate action to certify load crews on support munitions if required.
      12.2.2.10. Maintain a copy of all applicable AF loading TOs for assigned MDS aircraft.
      Training and test units need only maintain checklists for munitions to support weapons
      load crew training required to sustain daily flying operations and for munitions
      undergoing test and evaluation.
      12.2.2.11. Coordinate with the AMU Production Super to ensure WLT aircraft are
      properly configured and safe for use.
      12.2.2.12. Develop time standards for integrated loads.
      12.2.2.13. Ensure all load crews are qualified to load and unload internal gun system
      ammunition (including partial loads, at WWM’s discretion), and preloaded chaff/flare
      modules on assigned aircraft.
      12.2.2.14. Ensure load crews demonstrate proficiency on all capable aircraft racks and
      stations prior to certification on that munition. For conventional munitions capable of
      multiple carriage, both aircraft parent station and multiple carriage loading are required.
      For nuclear weapons, only the aircraft stations that are maintained in nuclear certified
      status are loaded.
      12.2.2.15. Inspect 25 percent of WS CTKs, armament test and support equipment for
      serviceability, at least quarterly, and initiates corrective action as required. Schedule and
      track inspections to ensure 100 percent of CTKs, test, and support equipment will be
      checked over a one-year time-frame. Document inspection results and use for follow-up
      action and reference as necessary.
      12.2.2.16. See Chapter 14 of this instruction regarding the SCR, End of Runway, self
      inspection program and Sortie Generation Operations guidance.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 271


       12.2.2.17. See Chapter 10 of this instruction regarding lost tools.
       12.2.2.18. Ensure MAJCOM Mandatory Course List (MMCL) requirements are met.
       12.2.2.19. Ensure individual tool kits are set up for each lead crew assigned. These CTKs
       may be stored in WS or the respective squadron, but are required to be maintained by the
       Lead Crews. In coordination with the WWM and weapons section NCOICs, determine
       the number of loading tool kits required in bomber units, and those that support only test,
       evaluation or training missions.
       12.2.2.20. Assist the WWM in managing load crew incentive program to recognize
       deserving load crews.
       12.2.2.21. See Chapter 1 of this instruction for duty shift, UCML, and command missile
       policy guidance.
       12.2.2.22. See Chapter 7 of this instruction for documenting maintenance.
       12.2.2.23. See Chapter 2 of this instruction for Safety.
       12.2.2.24. See Chapter 9 of this instruction for impound procedures.
       12.2.2.25. Ensure load crews are familiar with fuze inspection, installation and wiring
       IAW MDS-33 series TO procedures or TO 11A-1-63 (bombers). Conduct this training
       during initial certification.
       12.2.2.26. Ensure Evaluator Proficiency Evaluations (EPE) are performed on each
       LSC/Lead Crew member at least semi-annually to validate standardization of the
       weapons load training program. Document results on the AF Form 2419 and maintain
       within the WLCMT.
           12.2.2.26.1. WWM and/or Weapons Standardization Superintendent perform EPEs
           on Loading Standardization Crew (LSC) members during load crew Semi-Annual
           Evaluations. (Exception: 354 FW, EPEs will be accomplished during Weapons Task
           Qualification training.)
           12.2.2.26.2. LSC members perform EPEs on Lead Crew members during load crew
           Minimum Proficiency Requirement Loading evaluations.
       12.2.2.27. (Added-AETC) Develop load crew members prerequisite training that must
       be completed and verified prior to beginning practical training and being certified to load
       or unload munitions.
12.2. (AETC) Weapons Standardization. The WS function applies only to Eglin, Luke and
Tyndall AFBs. WS will provide all academic and practical training, including explosive safety,
required to load munitions on aircraft.
12.3. Loading Standardization Crew (LSC). The LSC works for the WS Superintendent and
conducts the weapons standardization and evaluation program. The WWM and/or WS
Superintendent evaluate and certify the LSC according to criteria in this section. The LSC team
chief must be at least a TSgt 2W171. The LSC trains, evaluates, and certifies the lead crews and
load crews in safe and reliable munitions loading procedures. Note: (ARC) If the LSC crew
chief is performing WS superintendent duties then the WWM will evaluate and certify the LSC.
The LSC will:

   12.3.1. Conduct and monitor training to ensure personnel maintain a high degree of
   proficiency in loading unit-committed munitions.
   12.3.2. Monitor certification and recurring training documents for accuracy and to ensure all
   load crew members complete required proficiency and academic training. The LSC takes
   decertification action if recurring requirements are not met.
   12.3.3. Ensure all load crew training is documented.
   12.3.4. Review and coordinate on all loading related AFTO IMT 22's and TODCR (F-22A)
   IAW TO 00-5-1.
   12.3.5. Develop and coordinate weekly and monthly load training aircraft requirements with
   the PS&D. This paragraph does not apply when the unit is using a permanently assigned load
   crew trainer.
   12.3.6. Monitor and evaluate lead crews in the performance of their duties.
   12.3.7. Provide non-load crew personnel initial and recurring weapons task qualification
   training, including practical training on:
       12.3.7.1. Weapons system safety devices to include proper use, identification,
       installation and removal.
       12.3.7.2. Munitions item safety requirements.
       12.3.7.3. Location of weapons system explosive items used to jettison and release
       external stores.
       12.3.7.4. Stray voltage checks, as required.
       12.3.7.5. Location and position of cockpit armament system switches.
   12.3.8. Perform spot inspections and evaluate flightline munitions/explosive handling,
   loading and postloading operations, and provide MPRL/qualification credit to the maximum
   extent. Augment wing inspection/evaluation teams during local exercises to assess munitions
   loading capabilities and activities.
   12.3.9. Perform semi-annual evaluations on all certified load crews. Lead crew members
   may assist; however, at least one member of the LSC must be present during all semi-annual
   evaluations.
12.4. Academic Instructor. An LSC member is designated to manage the weapons academic
training program. Designated WS members (7-skill level), one primary and no more than two
alternates, will conduct initial and recurring weapons academic training for all wing 2W1X1s (or
equivalent contractor personnel). The instructors will be familiar with the assigned MDS
weapons system and all UCML items. The weapons academics instructor is not considered a
maintenance instructor.
12.5. Lead Crews. The lead crews are assigned to the WS and assist the LSC in training,
evaluating and certifying unit load crews in safe and reliable munitions loading procedures. They
document, initiate and maintain the database to reflect qualification, certification status and
history of assigned load crew members. Ensure all load crew members complete required
proficiency/academic training and take decertification action when recurring requirements are
not met. Perform spot inspections and evaluations of flightline munitions/explosive handling and
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 273


loading operations when not directly involved in WS training functions, and provide
MPRL/qualification credit to the maximum extent. Perform flightline loading evaluations when
deployed, as required, in addition to their normal load crew duties. These evaluations may be
used to satisfy load crew MPRL requirements IAW this chapter.
   12.5.1. Initiate and maintain AF IMT 2435, Load Training and Certification Document, or
   locally devised form that covers everything on the AF IMT 2435, for certified crew
   members.
12.6. Training Facilities/Aircraft.
   12.6.1. Practical training is conducted in a facility dedicated to load crew training. The
   facility is of sufficient size to accommodate required aircraft, training munitions and
   associated support equipment. It is recommended that bomber aircraft have dedicated load-
   training facilities, however, where not practical, inside facilities should be provided to the
   maximum extent possible during periods of extreme inclement weather. Adequate office
   space and classroom with appropriate heating and cooling are required in the academic and
   practical training area.
   12.6.2. Aircraft will have a fully configured and operational (electrical and mechanical)
   weapons system for load training purposes. If a permanent load trainer (Armament Systems
   Trainer, Ground Instructional Training Aircraft) is assigned, it also will have a fully
   configured and operational weapons system. In addition, the WS will develop a schedule for
   periodic maintenance to weapons system components.
12.7. Academic Training. All 2W1X1s (and civilian equivalents performing in 2W1 capacity)
assigned to a wing regardless of duty position, and non-2W1X1 personnel who maintain specific
weapons task qualification, are required to complete initial and recurring (not exceeding a 15-
month interval) academic training. 2W1X1 and non-2W1X1 QAEs assigned contract
surveillance oversight duties of civilian contractors that perform MQ-1/MQ-9 munitions
loading/unloading operations will complete MQ-1/MQ-9 specific weapons academic training.
Complete initial academic training before the start of any practical training. Recurring academic
training may also be part of training and recertification for failed loads. Initial and recurring
course outlines may be combined. A minimum score of 80 percent is required to receive credit
for academic testing. Coordinate training requirements and course control documents annually
through the wing weapons safety office or the safety officer and the MTF. The weapons safety
office approves all nuclear surety training lesson plans. The WWM is the final approval authority
for course documents.
   12.7.1. Course control documents are tailored to unit and contingency needs and, as a
   minimum, cover the following items:
       12.7.1.1. Publications, applicable weapons related local operating procedures or
       directives.
       12.7.1.2. Safety (ground and explosive) and security.
       12.7.1.3. Aircraft, munitions, AGE, SE, TMDE, and munitions trailer familiarization.
       12.7.1.4. Testers, handling equipment and special tools.
       12.7.1.5. Operations in revetments/protective aircraft shelters.
 274                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


       12.7.1.6. Weapons storage and security system vaults (tasked units).
       12.7.1.7. Applicable command unique training requirements in 36-22XX supplements.
       12.7.1.8. Hazards inherent during CSO.
       12.7.1.9. Task Assignment List (TAL) and applicable –16/-33 TOs (initial academics /
       load crew personnel only).
       12.7.1.10. Explain Master Nuclear Certification List, Dull Sword definition and
       reporting procedures IAW AFMAN 91-221 and other related directives. (Applies to all
       units with nuclear certified equipment regardless of mission)
       12.7.1.11. Nuclear weapons systems fault isolation and troubleshooting procedures (if
       applicable)
       12.7.1.12. Explain procedures for operations involving nuclear weapons, to include
       safety wiring and sealing, use of Tamper Detection Indicators (TDI), two-person concept,
       no-lone zone, personnel reliability program (PRP), and AF IMT 504 custody transfer
       procedures (if applicable).
       12.7.1.13. Discuss accident, incident and deficiency reporting. Include in this training:
       DULL SWORD, AVOID AMBER, AVOID RED, BENT SPEAR, BROKEN ARROW,
       NUCFLASH, EMPTY QUIVER, Weapons Custody and Control Procedures and
       Command Disablement Systems (if applicable).
   12.7.2. Load crew academic training may fulfill the requirements for explosive safety and
   nuclear surety training if requirements of AFI 91-101 and AFMAN 91-201 are met.
   12.7.3. Weapons Expediter training - Weapons expediter training will be instructed by the
   Weapons Academic instructor. Initial training is required prior to assuming duties as a
   weapons expediter and refresher training is every 15 months. The following subjects will be
   addressed minimal per course: See Figure 12.1

Figure 12.1. Weapons Expeditor Training.




12.8. Practical Training. Practical training starts when academic training is complete. The
LSC or lead crews administer practical training to each load crew member on required munitions
and aircraft. They ensure practical training duplicates operational conditions to the maximum
extent possible and stress requirements such as DLOs, two-person concept, safety wiring and
sealing/roto sealing, controlled access and weapon custody receipt and transfer procedures, as
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 275


required. Load crew members are trained on loading and unloading procedures prior to
qualification or certification on munitions.
   12.8.1. If a specific type or model of munition has been requisitioned but not received or not
   available, any type or model of the basic item may be used for load crew training until receipt
   of the munition. LSC/lead crew personnel will teach the major differences between training
   and WRM munitions.
   12.8.2. Load crews must be familiar with munitions serviceability criteria and munitions tie-
   down procedures in TO 11-1-38, Non-nuclear Munitions, Positioning and Tie-Down
   Procedures and, as applicable, TO 11N-B1004-1, Nuclear Weapons Tie-Down Procedures.
   Blanket rejection of training munitions during load training is not authorized, and munitions
   may not be rejected solely because they are inert.
   12.8.3. Initial support munitions (SM) / limited use munitions (LM) training may be
   accomplished concurrently with initial primary munitions (PM) training and certification, but
   will be accomplished within 30 days (90 days for ARC) of completion of initial
   training/certification. When a new PM, SM or LM is designated on the UCML/TTML, LSC
   and lead crews require certification within 30 days (90 days for ARC) after receipt of training
   items.
   12.8.4. Load crew members will be familiar with the operation of AGE and SE which may
   be used during loading operations, even if the items are not used on a routine basis. Training
   on this type of equipment should be conducted by the base AGE Flight prior to initial
   training whenever possible; however, training may be provided by WS trainers if necessary
   to facilitate weapons load training.
   12.8.5. Units with a nuclear tasking that operate from, or deploy to, locations equipped with
   weapons storage and security system (WS3) vaults in protective aircraft shelters, will train
   load crews to unload and load weapons from and into the vault. An approved locally
   manufactured stand may be used to simulate the storage vaults for load and unload training
   (drawings are available through the MMHE Focal Point).
   12.8.6. All nuclear certified load crews at units with or without WS3 will be trained on
   trailer handling/tie-down procedures quarterly.
12.9. Load Crew Composition. Load crews consist of two, three or four persons within the
2W1 AFSC as follows (except for those qualification tasks specifically outlined in this AFI):
   12.9.1. Two-member crews: CV-22, AC-130H, MC-130E/H/P, HH-60 and MQ-1.
   12.9.2. Three-member crews: AC-130U, A/OA–10, F–15, F–16, F-22A and MQ-9.
   12.9.3. Four member crews: B–1, B–2, and B–52.
12.10. Task Assignment List (TAL). A TAL is a functional grouping of procedural steps from
applicable -16/-33 series TOs, by crew position, to be accomplished in sequence by each crew
member during a loading operation. TALs are used during training for all loading operations
except those for which job oriented procedures have been published (B-2 rotary launcher
conventional munitions, and B-52H CALCM pylon and CSRL loading/unloading is
accomplished procedurally parallel to the -16 procedures). TALs will include single, DLO and
integrated munitions loading procedures (including gun and chaff/flare loading). Units may
develop TALs for aircraft armament electrical functional checks (at unit’s discretion). Their
 276                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


purpose is to standardize procedures and facilitate the training of unit load crews. TALs are not a
replacement for TO procedures. Separate TALs will be developed for weapons qualification
tasks performed by non-2W1X1 personnel. MPRLs and semi-annual evaluations are not
considered training operations. The following guidelines establish minimum responsibilities of
individual crew members:
   12.10.1. Two member load crews:
       12.10.1.1. Crew member number one is the load crew chief and is in charge of the
       loading operation, performs functional checks and attaches stores to the pylon/rack.
       12.10.1.2. Crew member number two assists the number one person in performing the
       pylon/rack preparation and installation of stores to vehicle.
   12.10.2. Three member load crews (slight variations (i.e.; power application, ops checks
   performance, etc.,) exist with newer MDS (F-22, UAS) and will be outlined in TALS;
   however, key duties of individual members remain the same):
       12.10.2.1. Crew member number one is the load crew chief and is in charge of the
       loading operation, positions cockpit switches during functional checks and attaches stores
       to the pylon/rack.
       12.10.2.2. Crew member number two performs the pylon/rack preparation and operates
       test equipment during functional checks.
       12.10.2.3. Crew member number three performs munitions preparation and operates the
       bomblift truck during loading operations.
   12.10.3. Four member load crews:
       12.10.3.1. Crew member number one is the load crew chief and is in charge of the
       loading operation, positions the cockpit switches and attaches stores to the pylon/rack.
       12.10.3.2. Crew member number two performs the pylon/rack preparation, operates test
       equipment during functional checks and assists in loading of stores.
       12.10.3.3. Crew member number three performs munitions preparation.
       12.10.3.4. Crew member number four performs rack/pylon preparation, operates test
       equipment during functional checks, and operates the bomb lift truck.
12.11. Weapons Load Training Basic Terms.
   12.11.1. All-Up-Round (AUR). A munitions item which is shipped and stored in a complete,
   ready to use configuration. An AUR munition requires no pre-assembly.
   12.11.2. All-Up-Round Container (AURC). A container used to ship, store, and handle AUR
   munitions. Some AURCs are designed to load munitions directly from them onto an aircraft.
   12.11.3. Dual loading operations (DLO). A conventional munitions loading operation on
   bomber aircraft accomplished simultaneously by two load crews. (MAJCOM approval
   required for fighter aircraft).
   12.11.4. Integrated Load. The loading of two or more different types of munitions in an
   authorized configuration during a single operation.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                277


   12.11.5. Limited Use Munition (LM). May include, but is not limited to, munitions used by a
   unit for firepower demonstrations, test, aircrew training or like operations. LMs may include
   munitions which may be used in a war or a contingency. LMs are designated on the
   UCML/TTML. WWM determines the number of crews to be certified.
   12.11.6. Munitions Family Group (MFG). A designated grouping of munitions based on
   similarity of either physical characteristics or procedural commonality. Certification on a
   MFG is accomplished during initial training on each tasked munition within the MFG
   (subject to availability of training munitions) then maintained through the MPRL process.
   12.11.7. Postload Checks. Power-on checks and/or tasks required by technical data prior to
   declaring munitions-loaded on aircraft mission ready.
   12.11.8. Primary Munition (PM). Munitions which will be the primary weapons used by the
   unit to execute test/training or their DOC war plan and are designated on the UCML/TTML.
   12.11.9. Standard Conventional Load (SCL). The designation, which includes the number,
   type and configuration of authorized munitions, required for a specific mission and aircraft
   load.
   12.11.10. Support Munition (SM). A munition which may be used in support of contingency
   plans or directives and is designated on the UCML/TTML. WWM determines the number of
   crews (other than LSC/Lead Crew) to be certified.
   12.11.11. Monthly, Bi-Monthly, Semiannual, or Annual Intervals. Requirements will be
   accomplished by the last day of the scheduled month.
12.12. Load Crew Certification/Decertification
   12.12.1. Certification. These guidelines are used to establish the loading standardization and
   evaluation program. The LSC will establish and manage a program to train, certify and
   maintain proficiency for each crew on the munitions designated by the UCML/TTML or
   WWM for SMs/LMs. Certification and training requirements for load crews are based on the
   following:
      12.12.1.1. Except the LSC and lead crews, load crew members are not certified on more
      than 10 MFGs. Dual position (LSC and Lead Crew) or dual MDS (LSC only)
      certification is authorized; however, personnel may not be certified on more than 10
      MFGs (Exception; dual MDS certification is authorized for F-15 C/D/E Lead Crews.
      Certified LSC’s on F-15C/D/E may exceed the 10 MFG rule but the no more than 10
      MFG restriction still applies to F-15 C/D/E Lead Crews). Proficiency requirements are
      accomplished on both aircraft IAW this chapter. Personnel who are dual position certified
      will ensure they comply with MPRL and SAE requirements in both positions for which
      they are certified, they will not alternate between the two. Test wing personnel may be
      certified on more than 10 MFGs and multiple MDS provided all other requirements for
      load certification, qualification and evaluations are complied with and authorized by the
      WWM. UAS (MQ-1/MQ-9) personnel are exempt from the dual MDS/position
      restrictions imposed by this paragraph; crews may be certified on both MDS’, and #2
      and #3 members may be certified in both positions, provided they fulfill all certification
      requirements directed in this instruction. Note: AFRC Dual position certification of full
      time (ARTs) or dual MDS (LSC only) certification of load crew members is authorized;
278                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


      however, they may not be certified on more than 10 MFGs. In the dual or secondary
      position, personnel will only load munitions for which they are certified, and will comply
      with requirements stated above. Dual certify only in the MFGs required to meet mission
      requirements.
      12.12.1.2. LSC, lead crews, and load crews are certified on all PMs. The LSC and lead
      crews are certified on all SMs to provide the cadre for future certification of unit load
      crews. The LSC is certified (or qualified for items so identified by unit tasking) on unit
      LMs. The WWM determines the number of additional load crews trained and certified on
      support and limited use munitions.
      12.12.1.3. A minimum of two certifying officials are required to evaluate three and four-
      member load crews. A minimum of one certifying official is required for two-person load
      crews.
      12.12.1.4. Load crew member certification is valid worldwide with gaining WWMs
      concurrence. Reassignment does not necessarily require recertification by the gaining
      unit if the individual is certified on the same munitions, aircraft, and load crew position;
      and if MPRL or SAE requirements are current. Units develop procedures to ensure that
      WLCMT or equivalent data is provided to the individual prior to permanent change of
      station (PCS) departure. Losing units, therefore, provide gaining units with the AF IMT
      2435 or equivalent.
      12.12.1.5. Personnel must be certified before loading war reserve nuclear weapons.
      Certified load crews may be evaluated by using war reserve weapons if the weapons are
      scheduled for loading or movement.
      12.12.1.6. Personnel must be certified before loading conventional munitions, unless
      loading under the direct supervision of a minimum of two certifying officials.
  12.12.2. Document decertification and/or disqualification actions in the WLCMT (or
  equivalent). Decertify and disqualify individual load crew members if they:
      12.12.2.1. Fail to complete a required evaluation (SAE, MPRL, Qualification). If a load
      crew member is on TDY, emergency leave, incapacitated, or involved in an unannounced
      local or higher headquarters exercise/contingency operation, do not decertify or
      disqualify the member providing the current SAE/MPRL/Qualification requirements
      (plus all past-due evaluations) are completed within 30 days of returning to duty (60 days
      for ARC). (Exception: Member’s who fail to complete a required evaluation on a
      certification item within a 180-day period due to medical reasons will be decertified on
      the particular item(s) and must reaccomplish practical training for recertification). Note:
      (ARC only) Provisions in this paragraph also apply when individuals are
      excused/rescheduled from a Unit Training Assembly (UTA) and when loading operations
      are cancelled due to inclement weather.
      12.12.2.2. Fail to accomplish recurring academic training. Individuals are
      administratively decertified and disqualified on all UCML/TTML and qualification items
      until academic training is completed. Once accomplished, individuals may be
      administratively recertified and/or re-qualified. Note: Do not decertify/disqualify
      member's whose absence is due to leave or TDY. Member must receive academic
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                   279


     training within 30 days (60 days for ARC) of returning to duty or the member will be
     decertified on all UCML/TTML and qualification items.
     12.12.2.3. 2W1X1 and non-2W1X1 personnel performing as QAE Inspectors providing
     oversight of civilian contractor MQ-1/MQ-9 munitions loading/unloading operations are
     authorized to decertify contract munitions loading personnel if safety, reliability or lack
     of technical proficiency is demonstrated. The Lead Contractor Maintenance authority
     may also recommend decertification of MQ-1/MQ-9 munitions loading/unloading
     contract personnel to the on-sight QAE authority.
     12.12.2.4. Fail an evaluation due to the following criteria (applies to initial certification,
     MPRLs and SAEs):
         12.12.2.4.1. Exceeded time standard results in a failed rating for the load crew chief.
         12.12.2.4.2. A safety or reliability error results in a failed rating for the individual. A
         failure in this category due to a single sub-task error need not result in complete
         retraining/recertification for the loading task. At the discretion of the evaluator, sub-
         task retraining or thorough critique may be used to satisfy retraining/recertification
         requirements.
            12.12.2.4.2.1. Safety Error: A violation of safety publications, TO warnings, etc.,
            or an unsafe act that could reasonably lead to personal injury or death.
            12.12.2.4.2.2. Reliability Error: A violation of TO requirements that could
            reasonably lead to damage/premature failure of equipment or prevent safe reliable
            operation of a weapons system or release of a weapon.
         12.12.2.4.3. A demonstrated lack of technical proficiency by an individual load crew
         member can result in a failed rating. If the time standard is exceeded for this reason,
         the load crew chief does not need to be decertified.
         12.12.2.4.4. For integrated loads, the evaluator may elect decertification on any one
         or all munitions loaded. When the same rating is not applied to all munitions loaded
         during an integrated load, the load crew records will be annotated accordingly.
         12.12.2.4.5. Intervention by an evaluator during loading to prevent injury to
         personnel or damage to equipment may result in a failed rating.
         12.12.2.4.6. More than three errors per crew member results in a failed rating for the
         individual.
  12.12.3. AGM-65 tasked units shall load train using both the LAU-88 (if applicable) and
  LAU-117 launchers. Alternate launcher use each time the weapon is loaded in proficiency
  training (i.e., for crews on 30-day MPRL schedule load the LAU-117 one quarter and the
  LAU-88 the next quarter). LAU-117 loading need only be accomplished using the pre-load
  method. LAU-88 loading is accomplished by the single load and pre-load methods during the
  same training period. Single AGM-65 loading on LAU-88 launchers is accomplished using
  both MJ-1 and MHU-83 bomb lift trucks on an alternating basis and consists of a minimum
  of two missiles (one shoulder and one bottom station). Preloaded LAU-88 launchers are in an
  unbalanced configuration (one loaded and one empty shoulder station).
 280                             AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


       12.12.3.1. In test wings, the WWM will determine in writing the necessity to alternate
       loading the AGM-65 between the LAU-117 and LAU-88 based on Test Directives and
       unit planning documents.
   12.12.4. Units which have the AGM-88 as a PM/SM will demonstrate the ability to load the
   LAU-118 using both the single store and preload methods.
   12.12.5. F-15 AIM-120 loading will be alternated between the LAU-128 and LAU-106
   launcher.
   12.12.6. Personnel certified to load nuclear weapons on aircraft, may perform weapons
   transfer and tie-down procedures to and from trailers, WS3 vaults, and support stands for
   which load standardization training has been established and conducted IAW this instruction.
   They will not require these actions as separate certification items.
   12.12.7. Annually perform a SCL while wearing the ground crew chemical-defense
   ensemble using 33-1-2/33-2-1 procedures (if applicable). Credit may be given during
   exercises provided a full SCL is completely evaluated.
   12.12.8. Internal and external conventional munitions loads on B-52 aircraft will be
   documented separately. For munitions loading on B-1 aircraft, loading the 28 carriage
   conventional bomb module (CBM) does not satisfy requirements for 10 carriage CBMs.
   12.12.9. For contingency operations or deployed locations an Lead Crew should be, and is
   normally, deployed to perform WS functions. If a Lead Crew is not deployed, the senior
   2W1X1 weapons loading person (with WWM coordination) on location will have WS
   authority. Example: A new munition or load configuration is required to support operations
   and crews need to be trained on location (provided Seek Eagle approval has been granted and
   verified technical data/procedures are available).
12.13. Load Configurations. All munitions loads will be authorized load configurations IAW
the applicable MDS flight manual or valid SEEK EAGLE flight clearance.
   12.13.1. For initial training a full complement of munitions (if available) will be loaded a
   minimum of once on a rotary launcher, TER, BRA, CBM, etc. to provide the crew
   experience loading a full load.
   12.13.2. Sufficient weapons will be loaded during each evaluation to ensure the load crew
   demonstrates proficiency on loading/unloading each tasked configuration (adjacent stations,
   upper/lower stations, shoulder/centerline stations, etc.).
12.14. Minimum Proficiency Requirement Loading. All certified load crews perform
proficiency loads monitored by a lead crew or the LSC. The LSC monitors lead crew proficiency
loads. The WWM or WS superintendent will monitor LSC proficiency loads. Post-load
inspections do not meet these proficiency requirements. Each munition an individual is certified
to load, regardless if it is a primary, support or limited use munition, will be loaded at least once
within a 180 day period (90 day period for short tour locations). One third of the required
munitions will be loaded bi-monthly (monthly for short tour locations) to demonstrate crew
proficiency. For those munitions where no training assets exist (CBU-97, CBU-105, M129, etc.)
difference training will be provided prior to initial certification and during recurring academics
training. Load crews in air defense/air superiority units perform proficiency loads bi-monthly
using all committed primary munitions. For B-52 units, alternate loads between internal and
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                   281


external stations to the maximum extent possible. Note: (ARC only) One-half of the MFGs for
which an individual is certified must be loaded quarterly (100 percent semi-annually) to maintain
certification and provide evaluation of load crew proficiency. Units will rotate munitions within
a MFG for MPRLs, e.g., load MK82 Low Drag (LD) the first quarter, MK82 AIR / High Drag
(HD) the second quarter, MK84 (LD) the third quarter and MK84 AIR / (HD) the fourth quarter.
However, all UCML/TTML tasked munitions will be loaded/evaluated within a time-frame not
to exceed 12 months. For those munitions where no training assets exist (CBU-97, CBU-105,
M129, etc.) difference training will be provided prior to initial certification and during recurring
academics training. Load crews in air defense/air superiority units perform proficiency loads
quarterly using all committed munitions. For B-52 units, alternate loads between internal and
external stations to the maximum extent possible.
   12.14.1. Proficiency Review Period. Immediately following initial certification, crews will
   load one-third of all munitions monthly for a minimum of three months, after which Lead
   Crew (with LSC approval) may recommend placing them in the normal bi-monthly
   evaluation cycle (not applicable for short tour locations and ARC).
   12.14.2. Load nuclear PMs monthly. Only one type of munition within a MFG requires
   loading each month. Nuclear SMs (certified crews), to include single missile, single bomb
   and, payload exchange (for bombers), are loaded/accomplished at least quarterly. For B-52
   OPLAN 8010, internal, external, and integrated loads will be rotated monthly within each
   quarter. Launcher will include post-load checks (MIT/BIT). Single missile/bomb loading will
   include (SIT/BIT) annually.
   12.14.3. MHU-196/204 mate/de-mate operations with live or inert munitions require initial
   certification and will be evaluated semi-annually.
   12.14.4. Load crew integrity must be used to the maximum extent possible. In the event a
   crew member(s) is coded and unavailable to load, schedule the remaining crew member(s)
   with another crew as necessary to accomplish training.
       12.14.4.1. (ARC Only) Certified Load Crew Chiefs may perform MPRLs in any
       position provided they load under the supervision of LSC/Lead Crew using inert training
       munitions only. This stipulation applies at home station only. No MPRL credit will be
       given to those individuals during evaluations unless loading in the position for which
       they are certified. This deviation from policy enables units the flexibility to evaluate
       remaining crew members when a member may not be available to form a full crew and
       will only be used as a necessary.
   12.14.5. (B-52) Those crews certified for single missile loading/unloading will alternate
   between internal, external, AGM-129, and AGM-86B.
   12.14.6. MPRL credit may be given to load crews or personnel performing DLOs or other
   loading operations on the flightline during exercises, extended deployments or daily
   operations provided complete loads that satisfy MPRL requirements are performed and
   evaluated from start to finish. The required number of evaluators, equipment and all other
   requirements must be met to receive credit for these type evaluations. MPRL credit during
   flightline evaluations is only authorized when loading lives, dummy air training missiles
   (DATM), or D-2 type inert munitions.
 282                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


12.15. Load Crew Semi-Annual Evaluations. The LSC evaluates each load crew once semi-
annually on at least one of the unit PMs (SM or LM if no PM listed); all unit PMs will be used
on a rotating basis. Load crew integrity will be maintained to the maximum extent possible.
Decertify load crews failing to accomplish semi-annual evaluations on all munitions unless
exempted IAW provisions in this chapter. SAE’s are not required for lead crews. If an integrated
load is accomplished as the SAE (e.g., AIM-9, -120), document the SAE accordingly. There is
no need to document both SAE and MPRL. Note: (ARC Only) CSO (A-10, F-15, F-16) and
DLO (bombers only) procedures may be used to fulfill these requirements provided the entire
load is evaluated. Certified Load Crew Chiefs may perform SAEs in any position provided they
load under the supervision of LSC/Lead Crew using inert conventional training munitions only.
This stipulation applies at home station only. No SAE credit will be given to those individuals
during evaluations unless loading in the position for which they are certified. This deviation from
policy enables units the flexibility to evaluate remaining crew members when a member may not
be available to form a full crew and will only be used as a necessary.
12.16. Documenting Load Crew Training. Manage load crew certifications, qualifications,
SAEs and MPRLs by means of the WLCMT or equivalent. All decertification and subsequent
recertification actions must be documented.
   12.16.1. The LSC maintains load crew records in the WLCMT or equivalent system used.
   Include the following documents as a minimum: AF IMT 2435 (or equivalent) (front and
   back) for each crew member and AF IMT 2419 recording the most current semi-annual
   evaluation. AF IMT 2419’s must be maintained for all loads. Maintain either electronic or
   paper copies of AF IMT 2419s for a minimum of 1 year.
   12.16.2. If the UCML/TTML contains more than one item from MFG table, the MFG is
   entered. MFGs are listed as a single entry using the primary tasked item of the group in the
   title. For example, MK-82 MFG is entered when the MK-82 is the primary tasked item from
   its group. Separate entries are made for postload checks (if applicable). After initial training
   on applicable items within the MFG, treat the MFG as a single item and document
   certification using one line entry in block 7 of the AF IMT 2435 or locally devised form.
   12.16.3. Dates are entered upon certification and DLO qualification. Entries in date and
   certification fields on AF IMT 2435, (or equivalent), are deleted for other qualification items.
   12.16.4. Enter one of the following codes in the month column as applicable. If required
   loads are not completed and provisions of this chapter apply, use one of the following:
   temporary duty (TD), emergency leave (LV), incapacitated (ED), exercises/contingency
   (EX), or weather (WX). Code outs are not to be abused or used as a substitute for ineffective
   scheduling (WWM has final decision authority on coding disputes). The letter "E" is placed
   after the date for the semi-annual evaluation regardless of rating.
   12.16.5. Route AF IMT 2419 after semi-annual evaluations to the weapons section NCOIC,
   MX SUPT/Operations Officer, WWM, and LSC.
   12.16.6. Send printouts from the Load Crew Management database with the crew to TDY
   locations if loading tasks are to be performed. The following statement is added after the last
   entry on each product: "AF IMT 2435 reviewed; the member is certified/qualified on the
   items listed on this product." This statement is followed by the signature and date of a WS
   certifying official.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                     283


   12.16.7. Academic and qualification training conducted by the WS is normally documented
   in a MIS, however the WLCMT (or equivalent) may be used for this purpose.
12.17. Transient Aircraft Responsibilities. Arming, de-arming, and munitions
loading/unloading will only be accomplished on transient aircraft to facilitate required
maintenance actions. In such cases, these operations on transient aircraft may be performed by
any weapons load crew certified/qualified on the munition and aircraft. The MXG/CC may direct
the LSC or a lead crew to arm, de-arm, and unload an aircraft on which they are not
certified/qualified, if appropriate technical data and support equipment is available. In such
cases, the aircrew will be available for consultations on aircraft to verify flight worthiness of load
configuration, and to perform cockpit portions of required functional/stray voltage checks. If
these cannot be met, request help from owning unit(s)/higher headquarters. Local procedures
must be developed to control impulse cartridges removed from transient aircraft.
12.18. Dual Loading Operations (DLO). DLO is only applicable to conventional munitions
loading operations in bomber units (MAJCOM approval required for fighter units). DLOs
are the primary method for rapid munitions loading/unloading on bomber aircraft and are
authorized provided the following conditions are met:
   12.18.1. Both internal and external (B-52) or dual bay (B-1, B-2) loading is required.
   12.18.2. Load crew chiefs: Designate one crew chief to be in charge of the entire operation.
       12.18.2.1. One will check the aircraft AFTO Form/IMT 781 and verify aircraft and
       armament system status prior to start of the load and brief status during the pre-task
       briefing.
       12.18.2.2. Both are present during the pre-task briefing.
       12.18.2.3. Verify all previously loaded munitions are in pre-maintenance status.
       12.18.2.4. One will verify cockpit switches are properly positioned during aircraft
       preparation.
       12.18.2.5. Both will check off each step as they are accomplished in their applicable
       loading checklist.
   12.18.3. Load crews conduct independent loading operations from single or separate trailers.
   Note: Loading and fueling operations must not be performed simultaneously due to the
   hazard of the aircraft settling.
   12.18.4. Post-load power-on checks are not accomplished until all munitions are loaded and
   bay connections accomplished.
   12.18.5. Load crew chiefs ensure that the conventional system switches/controls are properly
   positioned and verify the conventional munitions status and inventory during post-loading
   inspection.
   12.18.6. Initial DLO qualification consists of academic and practical training. Recurring
   training only consists of academic training.
12.19. Weapons Task Qualification. A weapons task qualification is a munitions related task
that does not require certification. Individuals require both initial/recurring weapons academics
and initial and annual practical qualification training for these tasks. Recurring practical training
 284                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


should be conducted during normal flightline operations to the maximum extent. Training is
provided, documented and tracked by the WS.
   12.19.1. Checklist Qualification: Indicates that the person with the checklist is trained,
   knowledgeable and in-charge of the overall operation or task. Member’s must possess a 5-
   skill level minimum to be checklist qualified.
   12.19.2. Full scale inert/training munitions (e.g., BDU-50/TGM-65/CATM-120). If load
   crew personnel are certified on a munition, they are considered qualified (by position
   certified, except #1 position) on its inert version. In the event the load crew member is not
   certified on an SM or LM, then load crew personnel require annual training on the
   inert/training version and it will also be tracked as a qualification. If crew personnel are not
   certified on the live version and the inert/training munition is a standalone SM or LM, then
   load crew personnel require annual training on the inert/training version and it will also be
   tracked as a qualification.
   12.19.3. Two or more qualified personnel in AFSC 2W1X1 (or civilian equivalent) may
   perform the following tasks:

       12.19.4.6. Perform munitions/missile isolation procedures to facilitate other maintenance
       on conventional loaded aircraft only.
       12.19.4.7. Install and remove captive AIM-9 missiles (must have one checklist qualified
       load crew member), Acceleration Monitor Assemblies (AMA) and Airborne
       Instrumentation System (AIS) pods. Academics is not required for AMA and AIS pods.
       (Minimum crew size per TO directives). AMA and AIS qualification training are a
       onetime trained item that will be entered on a AF IMT 797.
       12.19.4.8. (ANG alert facilities only) Install and remove Argon (TMU-72 coolant tank)
       in AIM/ CATM-9.
   12.19.5. A weapons load crew chief does not require qualification to perform tasks on which
   they are certified to load in respect to parent munitions (inert/training munitions only). Other
   load crew members must be qualified to perform any portion of these tasks for which they
   have not been certified. To clarify, the load crew chief may perform in any crew member
   position when loading inert/training munitions if certified on the parent munition. The two
   and three members can only perform those positions for which they are certified or qualified
   in. (Use of #1 to load in the #2 or #3 position must be kept to a minimum.) Utilization of this
   practice will only be used when assigned manning dictates. Use of by position-qualified
   personnel will be the standard practice, until no other means are available within the unit.
12.19. (AETC) Weapons Task Qualification. Conduct initial training on properly configured
aircraft suitable for use; do not perform any other maintenance on the aircraft during training.
Document training in the weapons load crew management tool (WLCMT) or the MIS. Weapons
task qualification trainers will be fully qualified 2W151 or civilian equivalent. (Note: Each
weapons task qualification item uses a separate course code.)
12.20. Munitions Load Time Standards. All munitions listed in a single block comprise a
MFG for the respective aircraft mission type. The load time standards apply to all operational
users of the munitions or aircraft listed and are the minimum proficiency requirements for
weapons load crews. Units may establish more restrictive standards for local use. Unless
otherwise Noted in Table 12.1 through Table 12.3, the WS Superintendent shall determine and
set load time standards for qualification items, for integrated loads (including nuclear, if tasked),
and for loads performed wearing CWDE. All items require certification in accordance with this
chapter, except as Noted.
   12.20.1. The standard load times, from the MFG Table 12.1-Table 12.3, are standard load
   times for initial and recurring "WLT" training and evaluations for the respective single store
   (including full munitions preparation) and installation of impulse cartridges, if required.
   Except for BRU-57, an additional 10 minutes is allowed for each added aircraft station check
   on fighter aircraft, if performed as part of an evaluated load. An additional 7 minutes is
   allowed for each like store added to fighter aircraft loads. Load times are additive when more
 286                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   than one type of munition is loaded on fighter aircraft. For example, if an F-16 is to be loaded
   with two AIM-9s and a MK-82, the load crew shall be allowed 20 minutes for the first AIM-
   9, 7 minutes for the second AIM-9 , and 25 minutes for the MK-82, for a total of 52 minutes.
   Loads may be accomplished without full munitions preparations, however, more restrictive
   time standards must be developed. Units should develop optimum time standards for
   integrated loads (including nuclear, if tasked).

                                           Chapter 13

          MOBILITY AIRCRAFT DEFENSIVE SYSTEMS LOADING POLICY

13.1. Units required to install/remove chaff/flare on mobility aircraft (i. e., C-5, C-17, C-
130), will establish a program to train and qualify personnel to perform these tasks IAW
procedures outlined in this chapter. Units will also work with the local explosives safety
officer and airfield management to develop an OI for handling chaff/flare-loaded aircraft IAW
AFMAN 91-201 and AFI 91-202. As a minimum, the OI will include procedures for
launch/recovery/parking of chaff/flare-loaded aircraft; chaff/flare storage and transportation; and
partially ejected flares. The MXG/CC will appoint a 7/9-level individual with maintenance
AFSC as the Weapons Task Qualification Manager (WTQM). Note: Units with 2W1s assigned
will comply with training/qualification requirements outlined in Chapter 12.
13.2. The WTQM and the Weapons Task Qualification Crew (WTQC) ensure chaff/flare
loading operations are conducted safely, provide initial and recurring load training, serve
as the focal point for all chaff/flare loading issues, and observe load operations during
training. The WTQM and WTQC will not participate in load operations during training.
   13.2.1. Weapons Task Qualification Manager. The WTQM develops and oversees the
   chaff/flare loading standardization program, sets standards, and develops local policies and
   procedures. The WTQM is typically a 2A573C, however, other flightline 2AX7X personnel
   may perform this function. Individuals appointed as the WTQM will be tracked on the SCR.
   The WTQM will:
       13.2.1.1. Receive initial and recurring load qualification training from a WTQC and
       maintain currency on chaff/flare loading tasks. Once trained, they will develop and
       administer the unit’s chaff/ flare load training program. Note: In the event a unit is
       initially tasked and has no qualified instructors, it will be necessary for the WTQM to
       become certified at a unit with qualified trainers. Once the WTQM is trained and
       qualified, they can train and qualify home station WTQC personnel.
       13.2.1.2. Select, train, evaluate, and qualify a minimum of two personnel as the WTQC
       on safe and reliable munitions loading procedures. Evaluate and re-certify WTQC
       members semi-annually. WTQC members will be tracked on the SCR.
       13.2.1.3. Ensure sufficient numbers of personnel are chaff/flare loading qualified to
       support the unit’s mission. As a minimum, identify the number of qualified personnel,
       names and employee numbers, MDS qualification, Defensive Systems (DS) equipment
       type, qualification date, and date(s) recurring training is due.
           13.2.1.3.1. Ensure a course code is loaded in the MIS to identify trained personnel
           and qualification status.
       13.2.1.4. Establish time standards for initial and recurring loading tasks. The senior
       evaluator has the discretion to add to the time standard if inclement weather or equipment
       failure is the cause for exceeding the time standard. AMC lead wings will develop time
       standards for each MDS for qualification purposes.
 290                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


       13.2.1.5. Review and approve/disapprove AFTO IMTs 22 that pertain to chaff/flare
       loading technical data.
       13.2.1.6. Utilizing AMC lead wing developed MDS specific Task Assignment Lists
       (TALs), develop a local TALs for use during training for all chaff/flare loading
       operations A TAL is derived from applicable MDS munitions load checklist (33-1-2
       series TO) and identifies the load crewmember’s responsibilities by step.
       13.2.1.7. Ensure chaff/flare loading CTKs are standardized to the maximum extent
       possible. Chaff/flare loading CTKs must include all tools and equipment necessary to
       support applicable MDSs and AME configurations.
       13.2.1.8. Coordinate the scheduling of personnel for chaff/flare load training. The
       WTQM may delegate this duty to the WTQC.
       13.2.1.9. Coordinate with PS&D, or the RTC, if applicable, to obtain chaff/flare
       dispensing system-equipped aircraft for training purposes.
       13.2.1.10. Ensure training magazines match the characteristics and ―feel‖ of live
       magazines (e.g., weight, dimensions).
   13.2.2. Weapons Task Qualification Crew . The WTQC assists the WTQM in managing the
   chaff/ flare loading standardization program. The WTQC’s primary purpose is to train and
   qualify personnel to load chaff/flares, but may also perform chaff/flare load duties. The lead
   WTQC member is typically a 7-level 2A5X3C technician. Initial training will be conducted
   using inert munitions. The number of trained WTQC members should be based on
   current/anticipated workloads and their ability to maintain proficiency on all applicable
   MDSs. WTQC members are qualified by the WTQM. The WTQC members will:
       13.2.2.1. Provide personnel with initial and recurring load qualification training. One
       WTQC member is required to conduct practical training.
       13.2.2.2. Monitor personnel qualifications to ensure required academic and practical
       training is complete. Disqualify individuals if recurring requirements are not met.
       13.2.2.3. Spot-check personnel to evaluate proficiency. Disqualify personnel who violate
       safety, technical data, and reliability procedures, or fail to demonstrate proficiency.
       13.2.2.4. Develop/coordinate training schedules and provide to PS&D for inclusion in
       the appropriate schedule (e.g., monthly, weekly). Note: Enroute WTQMs forward
       training requirements to the unit training manager, who coordinates for ground training
       aircraft with the RTC.
13.3. Training Requirements. Personnel are considered qualified upon successful completion
of training provided by a qualified WTQC. Document initial load qualification training in GO81
or equivalent system and the individual’s CFETP. Document recurring load qualification
training in the qualification status system (GO81). I nitial qualification will be conducted using
inert munitions. Live munitions may be used during annual qualification to maintain currency.
Load qualification training consists of academic and practical training.
   13.3.1. Academic and practical training must be provided during initial and recurring load
   qualification training.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                     291


       13.3.1.1. Academic training is required before practical training is accomplished. Initial
       Practical training must be completed within 14 days of satisfactorily completing initial
       academic training.
       13.3.1.2. Practical training should duplicate operational conditions as closely as possible.
          13.3.1.2.1. Recurring practical task qualification is administered at least annually.
          13.3.1.2.2. As a minimum, practical training will include chaff/flare module
          serviceability criteria, actual chaff/flare loading, and operation of support
          equipment/AGE used during loading operations. Note: Weapons task qualification
          academic training may fulfill the requirements for explosive safety training if the
          requirements of AFI 91-202 are included.
       13.3.1.3. Academic training is administered every 15 months. As a minimum, academic
       training will include:
          13.3.1.3.1. Familiarization with chaff/flare loading publications,, including AFI 36-

       13.5.1.2. If technical data is available, then qualified personnel may perform chaff/flare
       load operations.
       13.5.1.3. If technical data is available but no one is qualified on the transient aircraft
       type, then the MXG/CC (or AMS/CC at en route locations) may authorize the WTQC or
       WTQM to de-arm and/ or unload the aircraft. The WTQM will submit a written request
       to the MXG/CC (or AMS/CC at en route locations) identifying personnel selected to
       perform the task, aircraft type and (if applicable) number of aircraft to be dearmed and
       unloaded. Maintain approved requests for 90 days. Note: This is a temporary, one-time
       authorization to facilitate required maintenance when qualified personnel are not
       available.
13.6. Identification of Chaff/Flare-Loaded Aircraft. Verify chaff/flare load status of aircraft
by checking AFTO IMTs 781A/C/H before performing any maintenance. Armament placards are
not required on AMC aircraft. If an aircraft is loaded with chaff/flare, it will be safed IAW
applicable technical data prior to performing any maintenance.
   13.6.1. Before loading chaff/flares, review the AFTO Form/IMT 781C, Avionics
   Configuration and Load Status Document, for Defensive Systems (DS) inspection status. If
   chaff/flare is loaded on AMC aircraft, annotate G081 using program 9018. Note: Do not
   load chaff/flares if the aircraft is overdue a scheduled DS inspection.
13.7. AF IMT 2434 Requirements. Annotate the AF IMT 2434, on all aircraft configured and
loaded to release or fire chaff/flares. Record the number and type of chaff/flares in the
appropriate munitions column. A locally developed form may be used as long as it includes all
AF IMT 2434 data elements.
   13.7.1. The following procedures pertain to reconciliation of AF IMT 2434 (or equivalent)
   and reconciliation responsibilities:
       13.7.1.1. Reconcile and verify expenditures during aircraft debrief. Maintenance and
       operations personnel shall develop procedures to capture expenditure data after each
       sortie where applicable.
       13.7.1.2. Flightline expediter will ensure visual reconciliation is complete.
       13.7.1.3. Homestation reconciliation data is provided to the unit MASO.
       13.7.1.4. For en route aircraft loaded at homestation, forward the AF IMT 2434 (or
       equivalent) reconciliation data through the Air Mobility Operations Group (AMOG)
       munitions POC to the applicable homestation MASO.
       13.7.1.5. For aircraft loaded at en route units, forward the AF IMT 2434 (or equivalent)
       reconciliation data through the AMOG munitions POC to the applicable host unit.
13.8. AMC requires documenting DS software version data and aircraft inspections (e. g.,
90-, 120-, or 180-day checks) on AFTO Form/IMT 781C. For software version data, enter the
following information in the ―Remarks‖ section for each reprogrammable system: type system;
installed Operational Flight Program (OFP) version; and/or Mission Data File (MDF) version
(e.g., ALE-47, OFP XXXX, MDF XXXX). If a system contains multiple OFPs, list all
applicable versions (e.g., ALE-47, Programmer OFP XXXX, Sequencer OFP XXXX, MDF
XXXX).

       14.2.1.1. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). TTPs provide maintenance
       activities flexible preparation and response options in a CBRNE environment. The intent
       is to employ AF and locally-developed TTPs to maximize combat sortie operations while
       operating in a CBRNE environment IAW AFMAN 10-2602. TTPs provide sortie
       generation activities with fundamental counter-chemical warfare (CCW) tools to survive
       and fight.
14.3. Aircraft Grounding (Materiel Defect).
   14.3.1. Definition. On occasion, units may discover conditions in multiple aircraft, engines,
   missiles, munitions, or related installed flight equipment of sufficient risk to personal injury
   or equipment damage that warrant grounding their fleet until the matter can be properly
   investigated and resolved.
       14.3.1.1. This section does not apply to conditions which are clearly limited to the
       affected unit/base (e.g., lost tool, fluid contamination, aircraft/equipment damage of
       known origin, or other strictly local event). In these circumstances, the affected unit
       should follow Impoundment procedures specified in Chapter 9.
   14.3.2. Initial Investigation. The owning MXG/CC or equivalent will direct QA to develop a
   local OTI IAW Chapter 8 of this instruction. The OTI will require a sampling of affected
   aircraft, engines, missiles, or munitions to quickly assess the extent of the discrepancy within
   the wing fleet. If there is no repair or corrective action specified in technical data, QA will
   also submit a TO assistance request through the Lead Command to the System Program
   Manager IAW TO 00-25-107. If initial sampling indicates the discrepancy is widespread and
   has the potential for personal injury and/or further equipment damage, the MXG/CC will
   discuss grounding the fleet with the WG/CC.
       14.3.2.1. Documentation. Annotate local OTI requirements in equipment forms on a Red
       dash and grounding discrepancies on a Red ―X‖ IAW TO 00-20-1.
   14.3.3. Grounding Authority. The WG/CC has the authority to ground wing aircraft. If this
   decision is made, the wing will notify their MAJCOM immediately by the most expeditious
   means (e.g., telephonic or e-mail) and follow up with MAJCOM, Lead Command,
   component NAF, and Headquarters, US Air Force (HAF) notification via the OPREP
   reporting system IAW AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting. This action will also
   formally alert other affected Lead Commands and the System Program Manager. The
   OPREP report should include the reason for grounding; immediate actions taken to ensure
   the safety of personnel and equipment; impact to current operations; limiting factors (e.g.,
   shortage of replacement parts); and expected timeframe to resume operations, if known.
       14.3.3.1. The Lead Command/A4 will determine if the risk of injury and/or damage is
       significant enough to ground all like-MDS aircraft. The Lead Command/A4 will
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                297


     coordinate with the Lead Command A3 and consult with the System Program Manager,
     as required, prior to recommending the Lead Command/CC make the decision to ground.
     Grounding decisions will be communicated via the OPREP reporting system.
        14.3.3.1.1. Lead commands will accomplish the following actions: determine the
        impact of fleet grounding on operational capability worldwide; ensure other operating
        commands are informed of the fleetwide potential of the grounding discrepancy;
        notify the AEF Center if grounding affects the capability to contribute to joint or
        contingency operations; coordinate with AFMC and other commands to
        provide/obtain advice and direction, as necessary; and coordinate final grounding
        disposition with affected MAJCOM and AEF Commanders.
     14.3.3.2. In certain cases, the System Program Manager, versus an operational unit, will
     discover a materiel condition with fleetwide impact and will recommend the Lead
     Command ground the fleet, or, in some instances direct immediate grounding IAW
     authority granted to the System Program Manager in TO 00-5-15.
     14.3.3.3. In the case of a deployed unit that is not assigned/attached to a parent EOG,
     AEG, or AEW, the grounding decision will revert to the first operational or maintenance
     USAF O-6 in the chain of command. Joint/Combined Force Air Component Commander
     (JFACC/CFACC) may override this decision if operational requirements outweigh the
     risk of continuing operations.
     14.3.3.4. For non-deployed aircraft supporting contingency or higher headquarters tasked
     missions, the Lead Command/CC or Joint Force Commander (JFC) may override a
     lower-level grounding decision if the operational need outweighs the risk of continuing
     operations.
     14.3.3.5. Units will annotate the grounding condition/directive in the appropriate
     equipment forms using a Red ―X‖ IAW TO 00-20-1.
  14.3.4. Release from Grounding.
     14.3.4.1. When a grounding condition requires System Program Manager involvement,
     the System Program Manager engineering function will investigate and recommend a
     course of action to the submitting Lead Command. The Lead Command/A4 will consult
     with the Lead Command/CC and Lead Command/A3 and confirm conditions for the
     release from grounding via the following methods; for Unclassified Messages: Official
     NIPR E-mail; digitally signed and encrypted using the Common Access Card (CAC)
     Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for Classified Messages: Official SIPR E-mail. If the
     corrective action is published as an immediate action TCTO or other certified repair data,
     individual aircraft compliance constitutes their return to service. If aircraft are grounded
     by a HAF authority then coordinate for release through AF/A4L coordination.
     14.3.4.2. If the corrective action is issued as a routine TCTO or no corrective action is
     required for unaffected aircraft (i.e., after investigation, the situation does not pose
     imminent risk to the entire fleet), the Lead Command/A4 will consult with the Lead
     Command/CC and Lead Command/A3 and issue a follow-on email as described in
     14.3.4.1 to affected units/commands releasing the grounding order and specifying
     conditions for returning to flying operations.
 298                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


       14.3.4.3. Units will annotate release from grounding by clearing the Red ―X‖ IAW
       System Program Manager provided TCTO/repair data and/or TO 00-20-1. If the
       corrective action is deferred to routine TCTO, next phase/isochronal, etc., clear the Red
       ―X‖ IAW Lead Command/A4 direction and enter the appropriate data for the deferred
       job.
       14.3.4.4. Component MAJCOM/CC/A3/A4 and Wing Commanders should provide
       follow-up and final reporting for grounding and release status using the OPREP reporting
       system.
   14.3.5. Stand-down for Operational Reasons. For these situations, refer to AFI 11-401,
   Aviation Management.
14.4. Aircraft Inlet/Intake/Exhaust Certification.
   14.4.1. This program is applicable to installed engines on B-1, B-2, F-4, F-15, F-16, F-22,
   and F-35 aircraft. Lead Commands may direct this program to apply to other MDSs. Affected
   units will develop a comprehensive training program to ensure personnel are knowledgeable
   and proficient in the performance of intake/ inlet/exhaust inspections. The number of
   individuals authorized to perform engine intake/inlet/ exhaust inspections should be
   sufficient to meet mission requirements and production needs, and ensure competency
   through regular performance. Authorized AFSCs are specified in Table 14.1; however, based
   on manning considerations, the MXG/CC may approve personnel in other AFSCs to perform
   inlet/exhaust inspections. Note: Do not confuse this certification program with ground
   maintenance FO inspections.
   14.4.2. Responsibilities and Management. The MTF/TD, in coordination with SMEs, will be
   responsible for development and management of the engine inlet/intake/exhaust inspection
   training program. Certifiers will be appointed by the MXG/CC and tracked on the SCR IAW
   Table 14.1 of this instruction.
   14.4.3. Formal Training. MTF/TD in coordination with the SME will develop and conduct
   training. As a minimum, courses will include dangers associated with the
   intake/inlet/exhaust, care and handling of equipment, applicable technical data, FOD
   prevention, inspection criteria, fault isolation/ damage assessment, techniques required to
   inspect engine intakes, inlets and exhausts and performance of an engine intake/inlet/exhaust
   inspection. Formal training and certification are mandatory prior to placement on the SCR.
       14.4.3.1. Certified individuals who PCS to the same MDS and engine TMSM may by-
       pass a formal training course. These individuals must be re-certified prior to being added
       to the SCR. Carry over date of original class completion from previous documentation
       (certificate, training record, MIS printout).
   14.4.4. Certification Criteria. Upon completion of formal training, individuals are task
   evaluated by a certifying official (an individual other than the instructor who administered
   the course), and placed on the SCR. Certifying officials will be appointed by the MXG/CC
   IAW Table 14.1 Units will limit the number of certifiers to a minimum to ensure
   standardized training and certification. Certifying officials will maintain proficiency in the
   same manner as other technicians; certifying officials will recertify each other.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 299


      14.4.4.1. Annual Recertification. Each certified technician is required to be recertified
      annually by a certifying official. Recertification is accomplished by having the technician
      demonstrate they can perform the task(s). A QA PE may be used to satisfy this
      requirement if the QA evaluator is a certifying official.
14.5. Aircraft Rapid/Hot Defueling.
   14.5.1. Rapid/hot defueling is authorized for aircraft identified in TO 00-25-172. Rapid
   defueling reduces time and provides a means to rapidly off load fuel from aircraft at a higher
   flow rate than defueling systems and equipment are capable of providing. MXG/CC or
   equivalent designates a unit OPR for rapid/hot defueling training.
   14.5.2. Rapid defueling operations are considered hot defueling operations whenever the
   provider/source aircraft has an engine running.
   14.5.3. Rapid defueling presents hazards which are not normally encountered in normal
   defueling operations. Precautions and instructions contained in TO 00-25-172 and applicable
   aircraft TO’s shall be followed when performing rapid/hot defuel operations.
      14.5.3.1. All rapid defueling ground crew members will be qualified to perform rapid/hot
      defueling operations by a qualified trainer. Training will be documented in the individual
      training plan in the WJQS or JQS. These individuals also require annual refresher
      training. Recurring training will be tracked in the applicable MIS. The rapid/hot defuel
      supervisor will be certified annually and tracked on the SCR.
   14.5.4. During aircraft to aircraft ground transfer operations, if the provider aircraft has at
   least one engine running, it is considered a hot/rapid defueling operation.
      14.5.4.1. Aircraft to Aircraft refuel procedures will only be accomplished with prior
      Lead Command approval.
14.6. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP).
   14.6.1. The aircraft structural integrity and flight loads data recording/individual aircraft
   tracking programs are established by applicable MDS specific TOs, and AFI 63-1001 and
   require coordinated action by a number of base level maintenance activities. An effective
   structural data collection program is essential to establish, assess and support inspections,
   maintenance activities, repairs and required modification/replacement actions.
   14.6.1. (AETC) HQ AETC/A4MA is the command OPR for Lead Command aircraft and
   HQ AETC/A4MS is the OPR for ASIP data collection systems.
   14.6.2. The MXG/CC or equivalent ensures an effective ASIP is established, appoints an
   officer or NCO as the unit ASIP project officer, and ensures effective measures are in place
   to capture ASIP data.
   14.6.3. The MXG ASIP project officer will:
      14.6.3.1. Act as OPR for a local ASIP OI. As a minimum, the OI will address:
          14.6.3.1.1. Identification of maintenance activities responsible for changing and

      14.6.6.2. PS&D will ensure ASIP inspections are loaded in the MIS and scheduled.
      Note: Classified ASIP will be managed with Lead Command-approved procedures to
      ensure safeguarding of classified information. Note: When required by lead Command,
      units may be asked to establish POCs for other related programs or data collection
      efforts. Refer to AFI 63-1401, Aircraft Information Program.
14.7. Hydraulic Fluid Purification (HFP):
   14.7.1. Lead Commands will make HFP equipment procurement/modification a priority.
   Immediately implement the following process upon receipt of required equipment.
   14.7.2. All aircraft maintenance organizations shall perform hydraulic fluid purification
   IAW applicable aircraft guidelines.

      purification process.
      14.7.2.2. Flightline users will perform any additional purification operations IAW
      prescribed aircraft technical procedures as needed. Note: HFP is not a reclamation
      process. It will remove particles, air and moisture but not contaminants such as chemicals
      and other petroleum products.
14.8. Cannibalization Program.
   14.8.1. General: CANN actions may be necessary when a condition prevents the
   accomplishment of a mission and the required assets are not immediately available from
   supply. Prior to performing a CANN action, verify the required component cannot be
   sourced from LRS, TNB or back shop assets prior to impacting aircraft mission
   accomplishment. When authorizing a CANN, the expenditure of man-hours and potential
   damage to equipment must be weighed against the expected benefit. High risk CANNs
   should not be performed unless priority aircraft are involved or lack of ready equipment will
   impede mission accomplishment. See Table 1.1 Note: Commanders should not necessarily
   view high CANN rates as a negative statistic that reflects poorly on the unit’s capability or
   production effort. CANN rates accurately record the lack of asset availability to the field.
   14.8.2. Definition: CANN is the authorized removal of a specific assembly, subassembly, or
   part from one weapon system, system, support system, or equipment end item for installation
   on another end item to satisfy an existing supply requisition and to meet priority mission
   requirements with an obligation to replace the removed item. Weapon system, support
302                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


  systems, or equipment include: aircraft, missiles, drones, UAV/UCAV, uninstalled engines,
  uninstalled engine modules, aircrew and/or launch crew training devices, C-E equipment,
  AGE, TMDE, serviceable uninstalled ECM pods, and guns. The three most common CANNs
  are: aircraft to aircraft, engine to aircraft, and aircraft to RSP kits.
  14.8.2. (AETC) A component already removed cannot be cannibalized. Changing the
  destination of a component already removed is a transfer or diversion action, not a CANN.
      14.8.2.1. (Added-AETC) Examples of priority mission requirement are CANN actions
      to meet flying schedule commitments or the timely completion of a major inspection (PE,
      PH, or ISO).
  14.8.3. Authorization & Control: Commanders, managers, and supervisors will closely
  control CANN actions. Although immediate benefits can be realized, the process results in
  excess expenditures of maintenance resources and may degrade readiness by exposing
  serviceable equipment to extra handling, assembly, disassembly or removal and
  reinstallation, and follow-on operational checks.
  14.8.4. CANN authorities (CA) will be approved by the MXG/CC or equivalent and tracked
  in the MIS. CA will be SNCOs and officers (or civilian equivalents). These personnel are
  normally Pro Supers. Personnel permitted to authorize CANN actions must be kept to a
  minimum. Those who are authorized to approve CANNs will not further delegate their
  responsibility.
  14.8.4. (AETC) The propulsion function supervisor, in coordination with the EM, will
  authorize engine-to-engine CANNs. The AGE function supervisor will authorize AGE-to-
  AGE CANN.
      14.8.4.1. (Added-AETC) Only the director of maintenance, or equivalent, can authorize
      CANN actions for COMBS-provided parts.
  14.8.5. Aircraft that have been cannibalized extensively may be identified as ―CANN
  aircraft.‖ Aircraft designated as CANN aircraft will have an assigned CANN manager. This
  manager will ensure daily documentation actions (forms/tags/MIS) remain accurate and
  complete.
  14.8.6. If an assembly is cannibalized to satisfy a condition caused by lack of bits and pieces
  (e.g., washers, nuts, and bolts), the assembly is counted as a CANN and the bits and pieces
  are considered transfer actions. Bits and pieces removed from an end item (without removing
  the assembly) for installation on another end item are considered individual CANN actions.
  Note: An item will not be cannibalized solely to attain a MC rate or any other maintenance
  metric.
  14.8.7. When a required part cannot be delivered and installed on time, the CA may approve
  the CANN of parts before the initiation of CANN documentation (e.g., Red Ball
  maintenance). The CA will give this approval only after confirming the part is not readily
  available in LRS,TNB, launch trucks, forward supply points, or back shops. The CA will
  notify the appropriate supply activity to change the ―mark-for‖ components in the document
  number. The CA will also ensure complete documentation is accomplished for each CANN
  action.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               303


  14.8.8. When TCIs, serially controlled items, items affecting compliance of a TCTO, or
  other components with inspection requirements that align to specific hourly, calendar, or
  event limits are considered for CANN, the CA will coordinate with PS&D or EM to ensure
  adequate time remains on the item to justify the CANN and to ensure appropriate records are
  updated. If CANN occurs, the performing work center will update MIS and notify PS&D or
  EM.
  14.8.8. (AETC) When CANN of CAD or PAD items is approved, the cannibalization
  authority (CA) will follow procedures for serially controlled components.
  14.8.9. Installed engines are not end items; engines are considered LRU just as a radar
  component, gun, seat, canopy, radio, multifunction display unit, etc. If a functional LRU is
  removed from one end item to put on another end item to fill a ―hole‖ which was caused by a
  supply requisition, (the requisition could be against the LRU), then this will be considered a
  CANN.
  14.8.10. Restrictions:
     14.8.10.1. CANN actions involving parts from ABDR aircraft, AF Museum Aircraft,
     Maintenance Training Devices (MTDs), GITA (possession purpose code TX), or DRMO
     will not be accomplished without authorization from the SPO. If the part is approved for
     CANN, it must not be put into service until all necessary inspections (e.g., NDI, pressure
     checks, operational checks, TCTOs) have been accomplished using specific guidance
     from the IM to ensure proper serviceability. Parts shall not be removed from static
     display/AF Museum Aircraft except as authorized by AFI 84-103. Aircraft possessed by
     AFMC in depot maintenance will not be cannibalized without first obtaining approval
     from the applicable AFMC single manager.
     14.8.10.2. An aircraft that has been extensively cannibalized will not be launched on an
     overseas or cross-country sortie/mission on the first flight following CANN status
     without owning MXG/CC approval.
  14.8.11. Documentation and Reporting: Specific documentation procedures for CANNs are
  prescribed in 00-20 series TOs. All CANNs will be properly recorded in the MIS and AFTO
  series forms. Aircraft recovering from CANN status will be carefully screened and all
  maintenance documentation thoroughly reviewed before being scheduled for a
  sortie/mission. The review will ensure all operational checks have been completed and will
  determine if an OCF or FCF is required.
  14.8.11. (AETC) In the event the MIS is not available, use AETC Form 1158,
  Cannibalization Control Register, or a locally approved form, as a backup system. Designate
  a centralized function to file AETC Forms 1158, monitor the CANN program, and complete
  in-house reconciliations with the Daily Document Register (D04). Forward copies of all
  AETC Forms 1158 to the supply mission capable (MICAP) function at least weekly for
  reconciliation with the supply system.
     14.8.11.1. (Added-AETC) The MASO must coordinate the CANN of munitions items.
     14.8.11.2. (Added-AETC) The applicable account custodian will maintain all
     documentation.

14.9. Combat Sortie Generation. Combat sortie generation is a process by which mission
capable aircraft are generated in a minimum amount of time, during peacetime or wartime,
through separate 2AXXX and 2WXXX tasks or by Concurrent Servicing Operations (CSO).
Combat sortie generation may include fueling, munitions/ammunition loading/unloading, aircraft
reconfiguration, Dash-6 TO inspections, and other servicing requirements, IAW applicable MDS
TOs, Technical Order Data (TOD), IETM, TO 11A-1-33, TO 00-25-172 and other applicable
directives. In conjunction with applicable TOs/TODs, units will use the procedures in this
chapter to accomplish combat sortie generation. Procedures can be compressed through pre-
positioning resources and concurrent performance of tasks. When authorized by Lead Command,
abbreviated AFMC approved Dash-6 TO quick turn workcards may be used.
   14.9.1. Generation procedures should be built around the operational environment, mission,
   and expected operations for which a unit is designated to deploy or support during
   contingencies or taskings. These procedures may be used during actual contingencies,
   scheduled exercises, and daily flying operations. Combat sortie generation includes the entire
   regeneration cycle for a mission capable aircraft to include any or all of the following:
   servicing, inspection, munitions/ammunition loading/ unloading, aircraft reconfiguration, and
   fueling. When authorized by Lead Command Munitions and Aircraft maintenance divisions,
   DLOs, described in Chapter 12 of this instruction, may be used to regenerate aircraft.
   14.9.1. (AETC) Dual loading operations (DLO) are not authorized in AETC.
   14.9.2. Concurrent Servicing Operations (CSO): The simultaneous fueling, and
   munitions/ammunition loading/unloading, aircraft reconfiguration, aircraft Dash-6 TO
   inspections, and other aircraft servicing such as oil, nitrogen, and hydraulic fluid. Oxygen
   servicing will not be accomplished during fuel servicing. CSOs provide units operational
   flexibility in managing resources and a rapid means of generating mission ready aircraft.
       14.9.2.1. CSOs requiring a Concurrent Servicing Supervisor (CSS). The key function
       requiring the CSS is refueling/defueling and only applies to Fighter/Attack aircraft IAW
       TO 00-25-172 Chapter 6.
          14.9.2.1.1. Simultaneous fuel servicing with aircraft -6 and -6WC inspections.
          14.9.2.1.2. Simultaneous       fuel     servicing     with      munitions/ammunition
          loading/unloading.
          14.9.2.1.3. Simultaneous fuel servicing with aircraft reconfiguration.
          14.9.2.1.4. Simultaneous fuel servicing and other aircraft servicing such as oil,
          nitrogen, and hydraulic fluid.
          14.9.2.1.5. Simultaneous      fuel    servicing     with    loading/unloading      of
          munitions/ammunition, aircraft reconfiguration, aircraft Dash-6 TO inspections, and
          other aircraft servicing such as oil, nitrogen, and hydraulic fluid. Note: Electrical
          ―power-on‖ portions of Dash-6 inspections are not authorized during concurrent
          munitions loading/unloading and fuel servicing operations. Power-on portions of
          Dash-6 inspections are accomplished prior to or upon completion of the concurrent
          munitions loading/unloading and fuel servicing operation.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               305


     14.9.2.2. CSOs NOT requiring a Concurrent Servicing Supervisor (CSS). When no
     refuel/defuel operations are taking place concurrent with any other
     maintenance/munitions tasks, a CSS is not required.
         14.9.2.2.1. Any or all simultaneous munitions/ammunition loading/unloading with
         aircraft -6 and -6WC TO inspections, aircraft reconfiguration, and other aircraft
         servicing such as oil, nitrogen, and hydraulic fluid. Note: When a CSS is not required,
         the weapons load crew chief is responsible for and controls all actions concerning the
         aircraft during loading and unloading operations. See Chapter 4 for detailed
         responsibilities.
  14.9.3. Lead Commands will supplement this AFI with specific requirements for 2AXXX
  and 2WXXX training and qualification, and CSS training and certification.
  14.9.3. (AETC) The MTF is responsible for course development and administration of
  training and tracking qualification of concurrent servicing supervisors.
  14.9.4. Manpower. Commanders may train additional aircraft or munitions maintenance
  personnel to assist in direct sortie generation production activities.
     14.9.4.1. Cross-utilization of skilled personnel may be employed to ensure maximum
     productivity.

             14.9.5.1.5.8. (Added-AETC) Coordinates refueling procedures that meet the
             employment training base requirements.
      14.9.5.2. Concurrent Servicing Supervisor (CSS) (Only for Fighter/Attack aircraft IAW
      TO 00-25-172 Chapter 6):
         14.9.5.2.1. The on-site supervisor responsible for all aspects of fuel servicing,
         munitions/ ammunition loading/unloading, aircraft reconfiguration, aircraft Dash-6
         TO inspections, and other aircraft servicing being performed during CSOs. The key
         function requiring the CSS is refueling/defueling. When no refuel/defuel operations
         are taking place concurrent with any other maintenance/munitions tasks, a CSS is not
         required.
         14.9.5.2.2. Must be at least a 7-skill level with a maintenance (2AXXX or 2WXXX)
         AFSC and at least 1 year of experience on the weapons system. The MXG/CC may

         14.9.5.2.3. Is a safety supervisor who will supervise only one CSO at a time and will
         perform no other functions.
         14.9.5.2.4. Will be designated on the SCR and shall receive training on safety
         requirements and potential hazards of CSOs. Will be certified as required by this
         instruction, Lead Command, and local maintenance/training directives. Reference TO
         11A-1-33 procedures for handling and maintenance of explosives-loaded aircraft.
         Reference TO 00-25-172 for flightline servicing operations and applicable AFMAN
         and AFOSHSTDs.
  14.9.6. Combat sortie generation will be conducted in approved explosives and fuels sited
  areas.
  14.9.7. Combat Sortie Generation Proficiency-Training Exercises. These exercises are
  mandatory training events to demonstrate the unit’s capability to generate a continuous
  sustained flow of combat sorties.
      14.9.7.1. Exercises will be conducted semi-annually (WG/CCs or equivalent in ARC or
      AETC will determine frequency) to ensure unit personnel proficiency.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                              307


     14.9.7.1. (AETC) If applicable, each AETC wing will conduct exercises to maintain
     combat capability equivalent to unit tasking. Exercises will include tasked flying units
     and selected base support elements with wartime tasking. All elements of the wing sortie
     generation capability must be realistically exercised.
     14.9.7.2. Duration will be at least 3 days (WG/CCs or equivalent in ARC or AETC will
     determine duration).
     14.9.7.3. The MXG and OG commanders will determine the number of aircraft
     scheduled to optimize aircrew and sortie generation training. War Mobilization Plan
     (WMP) -5 rates (or higher) should be used for planning combat sortie
     generation/regeneration.
     14.9.7.4. Perform after-fire inspections on all stations that fired IAW Dash-6 TO
     requirements. Tools, technical data and expendables will be available at each aircraft for
     all simulated firings. Applicable task times will be simulated (determined locally) by the
     BPO crew before moving to another aircraft or task. Half-up/half-down loading
     procedures will be performed to show recon-figuration of aircraft after actual and
     simulated inspections are complete. All inspections (actual or simulated) will be
     documented.
     14.9.7.5. Units will upload and download external fuel tanks during each exercise.
     14.9.7.6. Units will perform RWR and IFF Mode IV checks (as applicable).
     14.9.7.7. During wing combat sortie generation exercises, aircraft turnaround time is
     crucial to meet sortie generation requirements. Units will develop expertise and
     demonstrate the capability to perform combat sortie generation. The following
     procedures will apply:
        14.9.7.7.1. SCLs will be selected from known OPLAN requirements.
        14.9.7.7.2. Personnel participating in local exercises should be rotated so all
        personnel are exposed to combat sortie generation in the training environment.
     14.9.7.8. Conventional munitions operations will be exercised (e.g., breakout, buildup,
     delivery, loading, resupply).
     14.9.7.9. Load a complete SCL (or half up/half down to simulate a full SCL) on each
     exercise aircraft generated/scheduled to fly a simulated combat sortie.
     14.9.7.10. For each sortie flown, air-to-air missiles expended will be determined by shots
     taken, not to exceed the SCL configuration; all other external ordnance will be considered
     expended. Rockets will be expended at 50 percent. Ammunition in F-15 and F-16 aircraft
     will be loaded as required, 50 percent of all A-10 sorties will require reloading as a
     minimum (this may be simulated by hooking-up all required ammunition loading
     equipment and taking the standard time).
     14.9.7.10. (AETC) Reload ammunition after each firing sortie.
     14.9.7.11. (Added-AETC) Coordinate munitions support with host munitions activity
     NLT 90 days before the planned exercise. Perform munitions allocation transfer request

       before the planned exercise, identify potential shortfalls up the chain of command to the
       servicing munitions activity.
       14.9.7.12. (Added-AETC) Generation exercises are designed to train personnel, refine
       procedures, and provide a measurement of a unit’s capability to generate combat sorties.
       The objective of these exercises is to develop the capability to turn combat aircraft and
       crews rapidly. In developing procedures, AETC units will communicate with their
       employment base sponsor unit regarding requirements to support combat sortie
       generations. AETC units will design generation procedures suited for individual bases,
       based on joint support plan information containing descriptions of available facilities,
       communication, and base diagrams. For realistic training, only those assets mobilized and
       available at a deployed beddown location should be used. Training will be oriented to
       train by individual squadron.
       14.9.7.13. (Added-AETC) Units will develop training scenarios that include special
       mission requirements (for example, fuel tank installation, special munitions loading) as
       appropriate for their expected tasking.
       14.9.7.14. (Added-AETC) If applicable, operations will be conducted from an isolated
       and (or) deployed location. Unit participants are limited to only those aircrew and support
       personnel comprising the deployed unit type code and those personnel specifically
       designated for host base support functions. Tail number integrity will be maintained and
       generated. Deployed tail numbers will be the only aircraft available for employment
       sorties.
       14.9.7.15. (Added-AETC) Night sorties will be scheduled during each exercise if
       required by the operational plan (OPLAN) tasking.
       14.9.7.16. (Added-AETC) During initial generations, demonstrate munitions delivery
       and loading capabilities by loading one third of tasked primary assigned aircraft per unit
       with ammunition. Full ammunition loads may be simulated by cycling at least 25 rounds
       of ammunition through the gun system, or, if the gun system is already loaded, by cycling
       in the bypass mode, ensuring adequate spacing between 25-round minimum sections in
       the ammunition loading system to accurately simulate full load timing. For fully loaded
       ammunition loading systems, simulate full loads by cycling in bypass for a minimum of 5
       minutes. After completing these loads, unit aircraft may be considered fully loaded.
14.9. (AETC) Combat Sortie Generation. Combat sortie generation applies to fighter wings
and is a means to generate aircraft for tasked, planned, or actual contingency exercises and (or)
operations.
14.10. Crash Damaged or Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR) Program.
   14.10.1. All host and tenant units with flying missions or active airfields/runways are
   required to maintain a CDDAR capability. The host unit is responsible for developing the
   CDDAR program, but execution of the program can be delegated to the tenant units as
   appropriate.
   14.10.2. CDDAR responsibilities are assigned to unit Maintenance Flight workcenters (N/A
   for ARC) Unit CDDAR programs include all elements of emergency/mishap response.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               309


  Response to in-flight emergencies (IFE) must also be considered in developing base/unit
  programs.
     14.10.2.1. Minimum response to IFEs consists of assembling a tow team, pre-positioning
     it for immediate response, and it remaining in place until the IFE is terminated or until
     the aircraft is towed back to the parking apron if required. Depending on the nature of
     the emergency, other technicians may be required to stand-by to provide immediate
     response capability as the situation warrants.
  14.10.3. Lead Commands may regionalize CDDAR capability where it makes sense to do
  so. If CDDAR is regionalized, Lead Commands must supplement this instruction providing
  guidance for program execution consistent with this instruction. Where this capability has
  been regionalized, specific contingency plans must be developed considering mission needs
  and the following:
     14.10.3.1. Equipment availability
     14.10.3.2. Time sensitivity for re-opening airfields/runways
     14.10.3.3. Organizational capacity at the local level to provide limited removal capability
  14.10.4. All CDDAR programs must be designed to provide response capability to and/or

          respond to aircraft emergencies (with Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and/or Very
          High Frequency (VHF) radios if available). Responding vehicle operators must
          be certified to drive on the Vance airfield and possess a valid Vance airfield
          driver’s license. Vehicles will position themselves behind responding crash
          vehicles and not impede movement or vision. Vehicles that are not considered
          emergency response will need to be positioned in a staging area outside the Entry
          Control Point (ECP) until requested by the Senior Fire Officer/Incident
          Commander (SFO/IC). In addition, only authorized agencies may operate on the
          crash net. Personnel not required to respond will clear the area so as not to
          interfere with emergency operations. If necessary, the SFO or IC will direct the
          Security Forces to clear the area of non-essential personnel.
              14.10.5.5.7.4.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) During initial response to an aircraft
              emergency, the SFO is the IC and will determine if the aircraft is safe prior to
              releasing the aircraft for maintenance or recovery. Until the aircraft has been
              released by the IC, no one will approach the aircraft without direction from
              the IC. All vehicles, except Fire Department vehicles, will remain clear of the
              aircraft. This does not prohibit essential vehicles (such as tow vehicles) from
              positioning themselves nearby for immediate use. The IC must release the
              aircraft or direct specific actions before any vehicles, other than a Fire
              Department vehicle, approach the aircraft. This restriction does not prevent
              emergency actions prior to Fire Department arrival. After the aircraft has
              been deemed safe,          71 FTW Safety will authorize entry of necessary
              personnel IAW AFPAM 91-211, USAF Guide to Aviation Safety
              Investigation.

         14.10.5.8.9. (AETC) Conduct a crash recovery exercise annually for each assigned
         MDS consisting of lifting device positioning, sling hookup, and mock hoisting or
         lifting of the aircraft, including all dash-2 and dash-3 TO preparatory actions.
         Accomplish hoisting or lifting according to the applicable aircraft TO. Do not
         accomplish hoisting or lifting exercises when surface winds exceed 15 knots. Use
         tethering lines during all hoisting operations. When using a hoist and sling, apply
         enough tension to sling to ensure proper sling positioning (fore and aft). Do not lift
         the wheels off the ground. Record all crash recovery training as prescribed by AETCI
         21-103. Note: The actual recovery of an aircraft performed by a unit satisfies the
         annual requirement when it meets all aspects of a crash recovery exercise and was
         evaluated by QA.
         14.10.5.8.9. (VANCEAFB) Annual aircraft crash recovery exercises will be
         conducted on all assigned MDS. The crash recovery team chief will notify a
         contracted service provider aircraft maintenance Quality Assurance representative, 71
         FTW Ground Safety, Emergency Management, and a 71 FTW Aircraft Maintenance
         Contracting Officer’s Representative with the time and place of the exercise.
            14.10.5.8.9.1. (Added-AETC) The 58 SOW will perform a crash recovery
            exercise on one of the helicopter MDSs annually (includes CV-22), but will
            alternate with the other helicopter MDSs each year.
            14.10.5.8.9.2. (Added-AETC) Do not perform crash recovery ―lift‖ exercises on
            C-17, C-21 and F-22 aircraft, but CDDAR exercises will still be performed to
            ensure program management effectiveness. Units without access to a crane on
            base will perform lift exercises to the point of hooking up the sling and/or attach
            points and ―mock‖ positioning of a crane. The United States Air Force Academy
            (USAFA) will perform crash recovery exercises, but will not perform lift
            exercises.
         14.10.5.8.10. Coordinate with unit QA W&B manager when weight and center of
         gravity (CG) conditions are unknown.
  14.10.6. Recovery Team Qualifications:
     14.10.6.1. All team members must be qualified in basic CDDAR operations (except
     augmentees).

      directives. The CDDAR team supervisor will maintain a CRASH RECOVERY TEAM
      ROSTER with POSITION, DUTY POSITION, DUTY PHONE and TEAM
      SPECIALTY as a minimum. The team roster will be provided to the contracted service
      provider Quality Assurance representative and the government Contracting Officer’s
      Representative with updates as personnel changes occur.
         14.10.7.1.1. Personnel previously qualified and actively serving in a CDDAR
         capacity are exempt from attending the AETC CDDAR training course. Units are
         encouraged to schedule these personnel for this training as workload permits.
         14.10.7.1.2. Personnel previously qualified as CDDAR team members who are being
         returned/reassigned to these responsibilities must complete unit academic and hands
         on training (does not include actual lift) within 6 months (12 months for ARC) of
         being assigned.
         14.10.7.1.3. All newly assigned CDDAR team members must complete this
         requirement within 6 months (12 months for ARC) of being assigned CDDAR
         responsibilities.
         14.10.7.1.4. MXG/CC may waive the training requirement as circumstances dictate.
         However, if training is available, units must make every effort to schedule personnel
         consistent with this requirement.
      14.10.7.2. All recovery team members must receive annual training comprised of both
      academic and hands-on training/exercises. Hands-on training includes aircraft lifting
      exercises using a unit owned aircraft or Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA).
      Do not use operational aircraft for actual aircraft lifts in a training environment. If units
      have no available training assets, consider participating with other organizations
      possessing training assets. If no assets are available suitable for these exercises, units
      demonstrate capability by completing all steps but stopping short of actually lifting an
      operational aircraft. Ensure all training is documented.
      14.10.7.3. CDDAR team chiefs must complete an actual aircraft lift every three years.
      This can be accomplished through real-world events, the AETC formal training course,
      ANG training course, or locally using a GITA .
      14.10.7.4. MXG/CC may waive training requirements as circumstances dictate. Waivers
      must not be used in lieu of training if training is available. Units must make every effort
      to schedule personnel consistent with this requirement.
  14.10.8. Vehicle/Equipment Requirements.
      14.10.8.1. The MXG/CC determines unit vehicle/equipment requirements, within the

   ensure the BEE is consulted and directly involved in determining personnel health hazards,
   training required and appropriate levels of PPE.
       14.10.10.1. There are two distinct phases of an aircraft mishap--initial response and
       recovery.
           14.10.10.1.1. Initial response teams face the probability of an aircraft fire. As the
           composite material burns, gases, vapors and solid particles are released into the
           smoke plume.
           14.10.10.1.2. Recovery team members may be exposed to fibers and
           respirable/inhalable dusts as aircraft parts are moved, modified by cutting, breaking,
           twisting, or hammering. Personnel tasked to participate in crash or post-crash
           response, recovery, maintenance, and/or clean up operations must be aware of/briefed
           on all possible health issues involved. Units must ensure local policies and procedures
           for handling crash damaged composites are addressed to include training and PPE.
              14.10.10.1.2.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) The IC will coordinate response with
              BEE, Fire Department, CE and other required base elements for HAZMAT

              will consult and wear PPE IAW the contractor provided safety survey of the given
              mishap.
              14.10.10.1.2.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) The contracted service provider CDDAR
              team will ensure sufficient materials are on hand to respond to damaged or burnt
              composite materials on the T-1 and T-6 aircraft IAW the aircraft -3 technical
              orders and T.O. 00-105E-9.
14.11. Dropped Object Prevention (DOP) Program. A dropped object is any aircraft part,
component, surface, or other item lost during aircrew operations, unless intentionally jettisoned
from engine start to engine shutdown. Inadvertently released munitions or munitions released in
excess of the quantity selected by the aircrew, or a multiple release, are not considered dropped
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 319


objects and will be reported IAW AFI 91-204. (Note: Missing Chaff/Flare end-caps are not
reportable dropped objects).
   14.11.1. Responsibilities. All units, which fly, service, or maintain aircraft develop a DOP
   program with the following provisions:
      14.11.1.1. Lead Command DOP monitors or aircraft functional managers will act as
      OPR for all dropped object field inquiries IAW Lead Command established standards.
      The WG/CV serves as the DOP program manager. The WG/CV will appoint the wing
      DOP monitor. The wing DOP monitor may be assigned under QA.
      14.11.1.2. Training. The wing DOP monitor will identify and develop training standards.
      Commanders will ensure all maintenance personnel involved in on-equipment
      maintenance receive adequate DOP training.
      14.11.1.3. Prevention. Effective prevention of dropped objects starts when an aircraft
      door, panel, or cowling is opened for maintenance and during munitions build-up,
      loading, and arming. Maintenance personnel will ensure the serviceability of fasteners
      and the proper fit of doors, panels, connectors, etc. Place special attention on the correct
      length of fasteners and condition of nut plates and other securing devices. Supervisors
      place special emphasis on these areas during the inspection of completed maintenance
      actions.
          14.11.1.3.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) The 71 OG Commander will ensure dropped
          object awareness by flight crews during their post flight walk around.
      14.11.1.4. Investigation. The DOP monitor will investigate each dropped object incident.
      Every effort will be made to determine the precise cause to ensure positive corrective
      action is accomplished. Anytime a materiel or design deficiency is the cause, or
      suspected cause, a DR will be submitted IAW TO 00-35D-54, even when an exhibit is
      not available. Investigation results will be distributed to each appropriate work center for
      inclusion in personnel training and education programs.
      14.11.1.5. Reporting. Units will follow DOP program reporting procedures below:
      14.11.1.5. (AETC) In addition to the reporting requirements in AFI 21-101, units will
      provide a monthly report of all dropped objects that occurred during the previous month
      NLT the 5th day of each month.
          14.11.1.5.1. Initial dropped object report will be made to the Lead Command via

   procedures, all applicable technical data, fault isolation/damage assessment/defect size
   determination, and performance of an actual engine borescope.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                  337


   14.17.4. Certification Criteria. Certifying officials will be the most qualified 7- or 9-level
   2A6X1, 2A3X3, 2A5X1X, 2A5X2, or AFETS/CETS. Certifying officials will be approved
   by the MXG/CC and tracked on the SCR. The number of certifying officials will be limited
   to the amount needed to meet certification requirements and mission demands. Certifying
   officials will maintain proficiency in the same manner as other technicians; certifying
   officials will recertify each other. Upon completion of formal training, individuals are task
   evaluated by the certifying official (an individual other than the instructor who administered
   the course), and placed on the SCR.
       14.17.4.1. Certified individuals who PCS to the same MDS and engine TMSM may by-
       pass the formal training course. These individuals must be re-certified by a certifier prior
       to being added to the SCR. Carry over the date of original class completion from previous
       documentation (certificate, training record, MIS printout). Note: If applicable, assigned
       AFETS/CETS should be used to certify other certifying officials.
   14.17.5. Documentation. After completing formal training, the instructor signs off the
   individual's ITP within TBA. Upon certification, personnel are placed and tracked on the
   SCR. Ensure that all borescope inspections are loaded against the engine and not the aircraft.
   14.17.6. MTF will ensure the following course codes are tracked in the MIS:
       14.17.6.1. Formal training borescope course.
       14.17.6.2. Proficiency requirement.
       14.17.6.3. Annual recertification.
   14.17.7. Proficiency Requirements. As a minimum, fighter aircraft personnel bound by TO
   requirements for flexible borescope inspections must perform one flexible borescope
   inspection every 120 days to maintain proficiency. Work center supervisors ensure personnel
   who do not meet minimum requirements are decertified and must be recertified by
   completing annual recertification requirements.
       14.17.7.1. Lead Commands will determine proficiency requirements for non TO (i.e..
       event driven) inspections.
       14.17.7.1. (AETC) There are no flexible borescope proficiency requirements for non-
       engine or non-TO driven inspections. Personnel using the flexible borescope for non-
       engine or non-TO driven uses are only required to maintain annual qualification via care
       and use/handling training.
   14.17.8. Annual Recertification. Each borescope-qualified technician is required to be
   recertified by a certifying official. This is accomplished by having technicians demonstrate
   proper inspection requirements, as well as, use and care of equipment.
14.18. Flying Crew Chiefs (FCC). The objective of the FCC program is to enhance mission
effectiveness by providing qualified maintenance support for aircraft at locations other than
home station. FCCs are qualified in their duty AFSC and are required to obtain, maintain, and
apply basic knowledge in several other aircraft maintenance AFSCs. They are responsible for
launch, recovery, inspection, servicing, generation, and maintenance of aircraft in austere
locations and locations where specific MDS maintenance capability may not be available.

  14.18.1. MAJCOMs may authorize/develop a FCC program under the direction of HQ
  USAF/A4LF for maintainers who are required to regularly fly and maintain aircraft. FCCs
  are selected per mission requirements as directed by MAJCOMs and qualify for Special Duty
  Assignment Pay (SDAP) IAW AFI 36-3017, Special Duty Assignment Pay Program.
  14.18.2. The FCC program only applies to personnel assigned to positions on the Unit
  Manning Document with a ―C‖ prefix for the DAFSC.
  14.18.3. The following situations would not qualify the FCC for SDAP.
      14.18.3.1. Occasional flights where the aircraft is used as transportation in lieu of
      commercial air.
      14.18.3.2. Incentive or indoctrination flights.
      14.18.3.3. Deployments where additional maintenance personnel are required at the
      designated location to supplement assigned maintainers.
  14.18.4. Qualifying missions. A mission consists of one or more sorties with a mission
  number as entered on the AFTO Form 781A, Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. For a
  mission to meet the intent of this program, the mission must meet the criteria in the
  paragraphs below:
      14.18.4.1. The FCC is required to accomplish maintenance at locations other than home
      station to prepare the aircraft for its next departure.
      14.18.4.2. The mission must be one where FCCs are required to fly by higher authority
      written policies (e.g., special airlift missions, alert missions, special operations) or by TO
      to perform in-flight maintenance (e.g., helicopter ).
  14.18.5. FCC program responsibilities.
      14.18.5.1. HQ USAF/DPLF oversees the overall SDAP Program and provides program
      guidance in AFI 36-3017.
      14.18.5.2. HQ USAF/A4LF is the SDAP functional manager for FCCs. HQ USAF/A4LF
      sets criteria for FCCs, validates MAJCOM FCC reports, and forecasts FCC SDAP budget
      needs. HQ USAF/A4LF approves/disapproves FCC position increases/decreases in
      coordination with HQ USAF/DPLFA.
      14.18.5.3. MAJCOMs implement the FCC program: They appoint a program manager to
      enforce standards and prepare the annual report.
      14.18.5.4. MAJCOM program managers determine which squadrons will participate in
      the FCC program and will:
         14.18.5.4.1. Validate and forward squadron FCC SDAP requests (Attachment 6) to
         HQ USAF/A4LF and HQ USAF/DPLFA.
         14.18.5.4.2. Annually validate SDAP positions.
         14.18.5.4.3. Assign FCC SDAP positions with an AFSC prefix of "C" and an
         appropriate SEI on command manpower documents.
         14.18.5.4.4. Establish command unique training requirements and set additional
         qualification standards for their FCCs as needed.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               339


        14.18.5.4.5. Maintain quarterly and annual FCC reports (Attachment 4 and
        Attachment 5).
        14.18.5.4.6. Prepare and submit the command annual FCC report to HQ
        USAF/A4LF and HQ USAF/DPLFA by 15 August each year. Submit the biennial
        FCC report to HQ USAF/ DPLFA upon request.
        14.18.5.4.7. Review and approve/disapprove ACR for changes of the ―C‖ prefix to
        an AFSC on the UMD.
        14.18.5.4.8. Review and recommend approval/disapproval of ACRs for additions,
        deletions of the ―C‖ prefix to an AFSC on the UMD.
     14.18.5.5. MAJCOM XPM           (A5M)     Command       Manpower    and    Organization
     Responsibilities: XPM will:
        14.18.5.5.1. Coordinate and obtain approval/disapproval from MAJCOM for
        Installation Manpower and Quality Office ACRs pertaining to validation of ―C‖
        prefix to AFSCs on the UMD.
        14.18.5.5.2. Assign the ―C‖ prefix to AFSCs upon approval from MAJCOM FCC
        Program Manager. This provides MAJCOM functional manager and unit senior
        maintenance manager’s visibility of squadron FCC SDAP positions. Note: FCC
        SDAP positions do not effect a unit’s manpower authorizations.
     14.18.5.6. Squadron commanders:
        14.18.5.6.1. Control their squadron FCC program IAW AFI 36-3017, AFMAN 36-
        2108 and this instruction.
        14.18.5.6.2. Ensure FCCs fly only when needed for the mission.
        14.18.5.6.3. Appoint and remove FCCs IAW AFMAN 36-2108. Assign FCCs for a
        minimum of 1 year, unless removed for cause. If removed, they may not be
        reassigned for a period of 1 year.
        14.18.5.6.4. Ensure only qualified FCCs and assistant FCCs who meet minimum
        requirements in AFI 36-3017 receive SDAP. In addition, FCCs must fly a minimum
        of three qualifying missions per quarter. An indicator of having too many FCCs may
        be reflected in a unit whose FCCs routinely do not meet minimum quarterly
        requirements.
        14.18.5.6.5. Normally, assign no more than two FCCs per aircraft (an FCC and
        assistant FCC) to each qualifying mission unless approved by MAJCOM. Exception:
        SQ/CC may assign the minimum number of additional FCCs when required to
        maintain proper work-rest cycles or meet TO requirements.
        14.18.5.6.6. Appoint a unit program manager.
     14.18.5.7. Unit program managers:
        14.18.5.7.1. Track status and prepare unit report.
        14.18.5.7.2. Ensure personnel possess the appropriate SEI for their MDS aircraft.

      14.18.5.7.3. Provide a letter to their Installation Manpower and Quality Office and an
      information copy to MAJCOM Program Manager to change, add, or delete a ―C‖
      prefix to the AFSC on the UMD.
         14.18.5.7.3.1. The letter will contain the unit designation, function account code,
         AFSC, position number, and a POC.
      14.18.5.7.4. Ensure FCCs and assistant FCCs are aligned in a duty position with a
      "C" prefix by initiating an AF IMT 2096, Classification/On-the-Job Training Action,
      or special order.
      14.18.5.7.5. Counsel FCCs and assistant FCCs on SDAP termination. (AFI 36-3017,
      Table 3 lists reasons for termination.) SDAP stops on the dates listed in this table. As
      long as a ―C‖ prefix is attached to an AFSC the member shall receive SDAP.
      14.18.5.7.6. Review, update, and authenticate the monthly SDAP roster. Note: If
      changes are made on the monthly SDAP roster, an AF IMT 2096 or special order
      must be submitted to the MPF.
         14.18.5.7.6.1. Authentication of the monthly SDAP roster validates that each
         FCC is meeting the full intent of the program. The SDAP roster is the only
         administrative tool used to continue or stop the FCC pay entitlement. Note: AFI
         36-3017 provides commanders conditions concerning pay entitlements.
      14.18.5.7.7. Submit SDAP position increase/decrease requests to MAJCOM OPR by
      message, e-mail, or letter stating the number of positions to be increased/decreased

      final approval.
      14.18.5.7.8. Provide information for processing DD Form 1610, Request and
      Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD Personnel, for FCCs.
      14.18.5.7.9. Ensure TDY orders authorize FCC to travel in mission essential
      personnel (MEP) status. Note: Aeronautical orders do not apply to this program, as
      FCCs are not aircrew members.
      14.18.5.7.10. Monitor training qualifications and currency to ensure only qualified
      FCCs are scheduled for missions.
         14.18.5.7.10.1. As a minimum, maintain a folder for each FCC containing
         training qualifications and annual indoctrination course currency, immunizations,
         military passport information, appointment letters, and FCC Mission Reports. If
         the unit mobility section already maintains these source documents, either
         electronic or paper copies may be maintained.

        14.18.5.7.13. Report program status by fiscal year (FY) quarters to MAJCOM
        Program Manager NLT the 15th day of the month following each FY quarter and
        report FY annual program status to the MAJCOM NLT 15 July each year. Annual
        report will consist of the previous FY 4th quarter and current FY 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
        quarters ( 1 Jul - 30 Jun).
        14.18.5.7.14. Submit funding requests for flight clothing, per diem, and other related
        expenses for the annual budget. (For safety during flight, flight clothing is mandatory
        for FCCs and Assistant FCCs).
     14.18.5.8. Installation Manpower and Quality Office will:
        14.18.5.8.1. Forward ACN to MAJCOM to add, delete, or change ―C‖ prefixes on
        AFSCs existing on the UMD.
     14.18.5.9. MPF will:
        14.18.5.9.1. Update SDAP program actions in the Personnel Data System as
        prescribed in AFI 36-3017 and AFMAN 36-2108.

        System (JUMPS) data files.
        14.18.5.9.4. Notify unit 90 days in advance when SDAP decreases or terminates.
     14.18.5.10. En route supervisors:
        14.18.5.10.1. Will not assign FCCs to work other en route aircraft. However, FCCs
        left at an enroute location and awaiting transportation may be assigned to work other
        en route aircraft (N/A to ANG).
        14.18.5.10.2. Will brief FCCs on local safety precautions, maintenance practices, and
        limitations.
        14.18.5.10.3. Coordinate with the FCC and aircraft commander on a work/rest plan
        and transportation to quarters.
     14.18.5.11. Aircraft commanders (ACs) will:
        14.18.5.11.1. Establish with the FCC and en route/transient supervisor a work/rest
        plan based on maintenance and mission requirements. The AC will be the primary
        decision ermine when the FCC begins a rest cycle for the next mission.
        14.18.5.11.2. Upon arrival at en route/transient locations, determine the FCC's ability
        to safely and effectively perform his/her duties. In making this determination,
        consider the duration of the flight, the ability of the FCC’s to rest during the flight,
        and the quality of the rest the FCC’s experienced during the flight. The FCC’s
342                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


         primary job is preparing the aircraft (e.g., inspect, service, aircraft forms
         maintenance) for the next mission. FCCs do not automatically enter crew rest with the
         aircrew upon arrival at an en route/transient location unless the duty day was
         exceeded.
         14.18.5.11.3. If the FCC's safety is jeopardized by fatigue, the FCC's duty day must
         end.
         14.18.5.11.4. Ensure crew integrity for quarters is maintained and inform the FCC of
         billeting location. Any official business required by the FCC interrupts the FCCs rest
         period. This includes official business conducted on the telephone. Any
         Interruptions must be made only under the most exceptional circumstances.
         14.18.5.11.5. Provide feedback on the FCC using AFI 21-101 Attachment 3 and
         return it to the squadron FCC Program Manager upon return to home station.
  14.18.6. FCC qualifications and responsibilities.
      14.18.6.1. Primary FCC:
         14.18.6.1.1. A SSgt or TSgt 5- or 7- skill-level. Qualified technicians of higher rank

          unless otherwise stipulated by the approval authority.
          14.18.9.1.2. Waiver renewals: submit a brief justification for waivers requiring
          renewal.
14.19. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention Program. The WG/CV or Center CV/CA
is responsible for ensuring an effective FOD prevention program is established. All personnel
(military, civilian, and contractors) working in, on, around, or traveling through areas near
 344                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


aircraft, munitions, AGE, engines, or components thereof will comply with FOD prevention.
This section establishes minimum requirements for a FOD prevention program.
   14.19.1. Definition. FOD: Any damage to an aircraft, engine, aircraft system, component,
   tire, munitions, or SE caused by a foreign object(s) (FO) which may or may not degrade the
   required safety and/ or operational characteristics of the aforementioned items.
   14.19.2. FOD Prevention.
       14.19.2.1. While maintenance is being performed on aircraft, uninstalled engines, and
       AGE, openings, ports, lines, hoses, electrical connections, and ducts will be properly
       plugged or capped to prevent FO from entering the systems, both installed or when
       removed for storage. At no time will items, (e.g., aircraft forms binders, VTR tapes,
       checklists, tools.), be placed in or on engine intakes. Note: Does not apply to technicians
       performing maintenance, inlet inspections and blade blending requiring lights, files, or

  security forces. The chairperson designates additional attendees (e.g., agencies, detachments)
  as required. The host base FOD prevention committee chairperson will incorporate tenant
  units in the host unit program. Tenant units should establish their own unit FOD committee,
  but will still participate in the host program and comply with host program requirements.
  Meetings will be conducted monthly when the unit exceeds the Lead Command-established
  standard, and quarterly if the unit FOD rate is less than the established standard. The meeting
  will identify negative trends and develop action plans to resolve them. The meeting should
  also be used to recognize personnel making significant contributions to FOD prevention (e.g.
  golden bolt program, FOD poster contests, or other FOD recognition programs locally
  developed at each unit).
  14.19.6. (AETC) In units where there is not a MXG/MXW CC, the responsible group will
  chair the FOD Prevention Committee Meeting in the absence of the WG/Center CV.
     14.19.6.1. Suggested agenda items include:

          14.19.6.1.6. Results of X-rays for FOs during engine bay inspections, acceptance
          inspections, and phase inspections. Maintenance trends should be discussed when an
          increase in FO is discovered during these X-rays.
          14.19.6.1.7. Identification of potential FOD sources.
          14.19.6.1.8. Lost tools/items.
          14.19.6.1.9. Increased potential for FOD within the next 30-60 days.
          14.19.6.1.10. Dropped objects. Pay particular attention to those that result in
          downstream FOD.
          14.19.6.1.11. Breakdown of FOD inspections/assessments.
          14.19.6.1.12. Cockpit FO incidents.
          14.19.6.1.13. Commanders comments.
   14.19.7. Bird Strikes. Consult Technical Order 1-1-691 Cleaning And Corrosion Prevention
   And Control, Aerospace And Non-Aerospace Equipment for bird strike clean up procedures
   and AFMAN 91-223 Avian Safety Investigations And Reports for bird strike reporting
   procedures.
14.20. Forms Documentation.
   14.20.1. Document Repeat/Recur and CND discrepancies IAW TO 00-20-1.
   14.20.2. Document IPIs IAW TO 00-20-1.
       14.20.2.1. An IPI is an additional inspection or verification step at a critical point in the
       installation, assembly, or reassembly of a system, subsystem or component. These
       inspections are either TO, MAJCOM, or locally directed and are accomplished by
       qualified personnel as identified on the SCR. The weapon system lead command as
       defined in AFPD 10-9 will determine minimum IPI requirements and incorporate these
       requirements into applicable TOs.‖
       14.20.2.2. Operations Officer/MX SUPT compiles a list of squadron tasks requiring IPIs.
       The list must include WUC, task title/description, specific TO, paragraph, and step
       number within the TO task where the IPI will be called for. Note: Some digital TOs do
       not list paragraph and step numbers. In this case, list the description of the step just prior
       to and after the IPI. When developing the IPI list, consult with QA on trends or problem
       areas that continually warrant extra supervisory attention. Squadrons submit their on-
       and off-equipment lists to QA for consolidation, MXG/CC approval, and publication as
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                353


      the group IPI listing. IPIs must be reviewed every 2 years for applicability. There is no
      requirement to include TO-directed IPI tasks in the local listing.‖
      14.20.2.3. The IPI list for weapon systems using digital TOs where the paragraph and/or
      step number are not displayed will include a locally assigned IPI number for AFTO Form
      781A referencing, WUC, nomenclature, specific TO, paragraph number (if displayed),
      step number (if displayed), IPI task description, and description of the step just prior to
      and after the IPI. If the TO system has a digitally displayed IPI feature the IPI will be
      displayed when the IPI is required and will include the locally assigned IPI number and a
      description of the IPI task.
14.21. Ground Instructional Trainer Aircraft (GITA).
   14.21.1. Permanently assigned GITA aircraft are those aircraft that are not maintained in
   airworthy condition. Active GITA are maintained in system/subsystem operational condition
   for purposes of maintenance training and normally carried in possession code "TJ". Inactive
   GITA are aircraft permanently grounded for use in personnel training and normally carried in
   possession code "TX". This section does not apply to ABDR training aircraft. ABDR training
   aircraft are managed by HQ AFMC/ A4RE-PO. This chapter does not apply to training
   equipment maintained by CLS contracts administered by commands other than AETC.
      14.21.1.1. Temporarily Grounded (active). Temporarily grounded aircraft are subject to
      recall to the active fleet and are in assignment code "TJ" IAW AFI 16-402.
          14.21.1.1.1. Only those items requested by the ALC Program Manager will be
          considered for removal. If the item does not affect training and if approved by
          MXG/CC, the part will be removed and turned in as per ALC Program Manager
          instructions.
          14.21.1.1.2. Units are responsible for storing uninstalled or removed equipment that
          is not required for training.
      14.21.1.2. Permanently Grounded (inactive). Permanently grounded aircraft are those
      declared excess to future operations or flying requirements by HQ USAF. Aircraft in this
      category will be redesignated by the addition of the prefix G to the basic MDS and
      identified with assignment code "TX". Permanently grounded missiles retain their
      original MDS without a prefix. Note: Aircraft that have been terminated from the AF
      inventory IAW AFI 16-402, will not be reported as GITAs. Any questions about the
      designation of an aircraft used for training should be directed to the Lead Command
      AVDO.
          14.21.1.2.1. Upon assignment of a permanently grounded GITA, the Program
          Manager will initiate a preliminary "save list," identifying items to be removed and
          turned in to LRS.
          14.21.1.2.2. If an item on the save list is not removed, annotate the reason for not
          removing it and coordinate with the applicable Program Manager and group
          commander. If items on the save list are required for training and an unserviceable
          item will suffice, units should inform the Program Manager. Identify all
          unserviceable components furnished by ALC in a conspicuous manner (Red X or Red
          dot system).
354                          AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


         14.21.1.2.2. (AETC) In coordination with the trainer maintenance activity, the
         commander of the training squadron to which the GITA is assigned (82 TRG/CC and
         782 TRG/CC at Sheppard) will review and approve the save list. Ensure items
         removed are not required for training, safe for maintenance tasks, and will not
         disfigure the appearance of the GITA. The save list should not include those dash-21
         items necessary to provide adequate safety and protection for the equipment (i.e.,
         covers, plugs, pins, lock devices).
  14.21.2. MXG/CC Responsibilities:
      14.21.2.1. Develop an instruction to define the scope of group training functions for
      GITA use; functional responsibility for funding, operations, maintenance, and records
      management.
      14.21.2.2. Maintenance of GITA used in support of training. Units that do not have
      organic maintenance capability will establish a Support Agreement (SA) or MOA
      assigning maintenance responsibility. GITA maintenance includes on- and off-equipment
      maintenance of active systems and subsystems and necessary actions to maintain the
      aircraft in a safe and presentable condition.
         14.21.2.2.1. Determine which system and subsystem are required to support the
         training. Consider present, future, and cross-utilization of systems when making
         determinations. These systems will be maintained in the same configuration as
         operational equipment.
         14.21.2.2.2. Ensure explosive components are removed that are not required to
         support training requirements.
         14.21.2.2.3. Place retained systems and subsystems not currently being used for
         training into extended storage IAW technical data.
         14.21.2.2.4. Ensure standard maintenance practices regarding inspection appearance;
         cleanliness, ground safety, and prevention of corrosion are met. Corrosion control
         procedures are outlined in TO 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapons System-Cleaning and
         Corrosion Control.
         14.21.2.2.5. Develop and prepare inspection technical data check lists for use in
         inspecting the condition and safety of equipment before use and ensure inspections
         are performed. Prior-to-use inspections are conducted by the using organization
         employing a tailored weapon system pre-/post-dock checklist. Conduct periodic
         maintenance inspections using a tailored work deck.
         14.21.2.2.6. Prepare a separate memorandum for each GITA, addressed to the
         appropriate ALC Program Manager for the aircraft and inform them of the systems
         and subsystems that will be maintained in operational configuration. When changes in
         requirements occur, initiate a new memorandum. Provide copies of all GITA
         memorandums to the Lead Command AVDO.
         14.21.2.2.6. (AETC) Provide an informational copy of all memorandums to 2
         AF/TTOC-O workflow and the applicable logistics support function.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               355


        14.21.2.2.7. Ensure air and space vehicle inventory reporting IAW AFI 21-103 as
        required for ground trainers. Aircraft used for ground trainers are exempt from status
        and utilization reporting.
        14.21.2.2.8. Ensure maintenance actions are documented IAW 00-20 series TOs.
        Lead Commands determine use of MIS for permanently grounded GITA records
        management. Owning units not having maintenance capability will establish SAs or
        MOAs.
        14.21.2.2.8. (AETC) Use of the MIS is not required for ―permanently grounded‖
        GITAs.
        14.21.2.2.9. Ensure timely completion of TCTOs on systems designated for
        configuration management and proper configuration status accounting is maintained.
        Accomplish TCTOs on systems not designated for configuration management as
        required to ensure safety of operation or as directed by Program Manager on aircraft
        coded as "TJ".
        14.21.2.2.10. Ensure proper coordination and documentation of parts removed from
        training aircraft are accomplished as follows:
            14.21.2.2.10.1. When an item is removed or replaced, supervisors ensure this
            action is documented in the aircraft forms. Include the authority for removal (e.g.,
            message number, telecon, letters, and dates) and condition of
            installed/replacement items.
            14.21.2.2.10.2. When the limited save list actions have been done, forward a
            copy of the completed list to the documentation function. This copy becomes part
            of the historical records. Also forward a second copy to the appropriate ALC
            Program Manager.
            14.21.2.2.10.3. Ensure W&B handbook requirements are complied with IAW TO
            1-1B-50 and applicable -5 series TOs.
            14.21.2.2.10.4. Ensure operating and maintenance technical data are readily
            accessible whenever the GITA is in use or undergoing inspection.
            14.21.2.2.10.5. Identify an individual to oversee GITA as an additional duty.
            Individual must possess the technical expertise, management skills, and
            leadership ability to assure quality maintenance standards of equipment condition,
            reliability, and safety are attained. Individual is responsible to accomplish and/or
            coordinate maintenance actions for the GITA, ensure GITA documentation is
            accurate and complete, and must be qualified to operate GITA systems and
            appropriate support equipment to conduct GITA maintenance.
     14.21.2.3. For equipment designated as trainers, only the systems required for technical
     training (or those required to ensure safety or system integrity) need to be maintained.
     (This does not apply to "temporarily" grounded aircraft or operational equipment or
     systems on loan from Lead Commands or ALCs.)
     14.21.2.3. (AETC) The systems to be maintained on permanently grounded aircraft are
     identified on the aircraft utilization and requirements listing published in coordination
     with the school activity and trainer maintenance activity.
 356                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   14.21.3. Technical Data Applicability:
       14.21.3.1. Operational systems on GITAs will be maintained IAW applicable technical
       data. The specific policy governing the use and modification of technical data is
       contained in TO 00-5-1. Some systems may be operated and maintained with original
       contractor data because formal technical data was never developed and/or the contractor
       data was never assigned a TO number.
       14.21.3.2. Inspection and lubrication requirements on TX coded aircraft may be adjusted
       to correspond with training requirements and equipment usage and to prevent over or
       under inspection. Additionally, where significant savings may be achieved, the
       commander or contract project manager (in coordination with the functional commander
       or director) may authorize deviations or changes to technical data requirements, including
       substitution of materials. In all cases, safety or design function must not be compromised.
       Maintain documentation authorizing deviations.
       14.21.3.2. (AETC) A master listing of items exempt from inspection requirements will
       be maintained and reviewed annually. Source documents for exempt items will be
       maintained by the QA function. Any deviations to technical data requirements for
       configuration-controlled training equipment or systems must be coordinated with the
       applicable program manager.
       14.21.3.3. TCTOs. The QA function or other designated agency is responsible for
       determining applicability of TCTOs for GITAs.
14.21. (AETC) Ground Instructional Trainer Aircraft (GITA). This section does not apply
to aircraft that are primarily used for flying training. Aircraft entering into possession code TJ
must be mission capable. Possession code TJ will not be used to mask NMC time. Maintenance
will not be performed on aircraft in TJ. Aircraft in possession code TJ are used for training
purposes only.
14.22. Hangar Queen Aircraft.
   14.22.1. General. The objective of this program is to ensure the entire fleet remains healthy
   and all possible management actions are carried out to ensure aircraft do not remain
   inoperative for extended periods. Lead Commands will establish a Hangar Queen program.
   14.22.1. (AETC) Report aircraft in Hangar Queen according to AETCI 21-105.
   14.22.2. Definitions:
       14.22.2.1. A Hangar Queen is a unit-possessed aircraft that has not flown for at least 30
       calendar days. Aircraft are exempt from accruing Hangar Queen time for up to ten days
       immediately following DFT/CFT repair or maintenance; however, if an aircraft is not
       flown after the tenth day, the ten days are included in the total number of days since last
       fly date to determine the Hangar Queen category computation. All aircraft placed on
       higher HQ alert status are exempt from Hangar Queen management and reporting.
       Additionally, aircraft with low observable (LO) technology (e.g., B-2, F-22) placed on or
       postured for higher HQ/local alert status taskings are exempt from Hangar Queen
       reporting throughout the duration of alert status/posturing. An aircraft is released from
       Hangar Queen status after the first flight. A few examples are provided to clarify when an
       aircraft becomes a Hangar Queen.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                  357


         14.22.2.1.1. A unit-possessed aircraft has not flown for 20 calendar days, enters
         depot status for 5 more calendar days, and then returns to unit possession on the 26th
         non-fly day; the unit has up to 10 calendar days to fly the aircraft to avoid Hangar
         Queen status. If this aircraft does not fly on the 10th calendar day (35th non-fly day),
         the aircraft would become 36-day Category 1 Hangar Queen on the next day.
         14.22.2.1.2. A unit-possessed aircraft has not flown for 2 calendar days, then enters
         depot status for 1 calendar day and is returned to unit possession, the unit must fly the
         aircraft in the next 27 calendar days to avoid becoming Category 1.
     14.22.2.2. Hangar Queen aircraft are further defined by three categories:
         14.22.2.2.1. Category 1 -- Aircraft that have not flown for 30 to 59 calendar days.
         14.22.2.2.2. Category 2 -- Aircraft that have not flown for 60 to 89 calendar days.
         14.22.2.2.3. Category 3 -- Aircraft that have not flown for 90 or more calendar days.
  14.22.3. When an aircraft becomes identified as a Hangar Queen, management must
  intensify their efforts to alleviate the condition as soon as possible (e.g., mission impact
  letters, Lead Command and item manager assistance). Aircraft last fly day shall be accessible
  through the AF Portal Fleet Asset Status Gadget.
     14.22.3.1. When an aircraft becomes a Category 1 Hangar Queen, establish a
     maintenance recovery plan that minimizes the time needed to get the aircraft airborne.
     Assign a Hangar Queen manager to implement the plan. Forming a temporary dedicated
     recovery team is also an option. Ensure strict management, control, and documentation of
     all CANNs, transfer, and diversion actions from the Hangar Queen aircraft. Brief aircraft
     maintenance and supply status to the SQ/CC daily and weekly to the MXG/CC and
     WG/CC. Category 1 aircraft are managed locally.
     14.22.3.2. When an aircraft becomes a Category 2 Hangar Queen, assign a SNCO or
     officer (or civilian equivalent) to manage the Hangar Queen. The MXG/CC or designated
     representative must approve any further CANNs, transfer, and diversion actions from the
     Hangar Queen aircraft. Brief aircraft maintenance and supply status at the daily wing
     standup meeting. Units will report aircraft tail number(s) monthly to the Lead Command
     with the estimated delivery dates for top down-time driver (AWP) parts.
     14.22.3.3. When an aircraft becomes a Category 3 Hangar Queen, aircraft maintenance
     and supply status will be briefed at the daily wing standup meeting. Units will report
     aircraft tail number(s) monthly to the Lead Command with the estimated delivery dates
     for top down-time driver (AWP) parts.
  14.22.4. Ensure applicable Dash-6 and 00-20 series TO requirements and TCTOs are
  accomplished.
  14.22.5. Inform the MOC of any change in aircraft status.
  14.22.6. MXG/CC will determine the need for an FCF/OCF (if not otherwise required by the
  aircraft specific TO).
  14.22.6. (AETC) As a minimum, include an operational check flight (OCF) in the first
  flight following a category 3 Hangar Queen status.
 358                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   14.22.7. QA will perform a final review of all aircraft forms initiated since the last flight
   prior to the first flight.
14.23. Hot Refueling Procedures.
   14.23.1. Hot refueling is the transfer of fuel into an aircraft having one or more engines
   running. The purpose of hot refueling is to reduce aircraft ground time, personnel and
   equipment support requirements and increase system reliability by eliminating system shut
   down and subsequent restart. Refer to the following sources for additional guidance: TO 00-
   25-172, TO 00-25-172CL-4, Checklist, Aircraft Servicing with USAF R-5, R-9, and R-11
   Fuel Servicing Vehicles, TO 37A9-3-11-lCL-l, Checklist, Operational and Organizational
   Maintenance Hot Refueling and Hot Integrated Combat Turn-Around Procedures, Aircraft
   Fuel Servicing Unit Type GRU 17/E Pantograph PACAF Type IV Hydrant Servicing, and
   AFOSHSTD 91-100. Units possessing A/OA-10, F-15, F-16, and F-22A combat coded "CC"
   or E-4B combat support coded "CA" aircraft certified for hot refueling develop and maintain
   the capability to quickly and safely hot refuel those assigned aircraft (applicable to ANG if
   tasked). This requirement also applies to training funded "TF" units having specific
   contingency taskings. This section does not apply to concurrent servicing operations used on
   large-frame aircraft.
   14.23.2. PACAF/USAFE ONLY: Main operating bases (MOBs), if OPLAN-tasked sortie
   rates require, must keep sites certified for hot-pit refueling even if they do not have an active
   program. Supported Commands must be consulted for Note to this direction.
   14.23.3. Hot refueling is not accomplished until the location, equipment requirements, and
   personnel qualifications are certified IAW this instruction and TO 00-25-172.
       14.23.3.1. Each base fuels management flight will maintain sufficient hot refueling
       certified fuels specialists for each squadron authorized to conduct hot refueling.
       14.23.3.2. Site Certification. Hot pit refueling sites must be certified IAW TO 00-25-172
       and this instruction. The mission support group commander (MSG/CC) will appoint a
       base site certification team consisting of the following:
          14.23.3.2.1. Field grade maintenance officer as the site certifying official.
          14.23.3.2.2. Representative from OSS Airfield Management Office, knowledgeable
          of aircraft taxiways, parking ramp, and hot refuel safe distance requirements.
          14.23.3.2.3. Maintenance member with 2AXXX AFSC from MXG QA office,
          knowledgeable of hot refueling procedures.
          14.23.3.2.4. Wing Ground Safety member, minimum SSgt 1S071 or civilian
          equivalent, task qualified in site certification and knowledgeable of hot refueling
          operations.
          14.23.3.2.5. Fuels management flight member, AFSC 2F0X1.
          14.23.3.2.6. Civil engineering member, AFSC 3E271 or civilian equivalent, familiar
          with aircraft ramp requirements for hot refueling.
          14.23.3.2.7. Fire protection member, minimum AFSC 3E771 or civilian equivalent,
          familiar with fire protection standby requirements in TO 00-25-172 for hot refueling.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                    359


  14.23.4. The following listing provides questions that must be addressed as part of the site
  certification. This listing provides pertinent questions for the site, but is not provided as a
  substitute for TO 00-25-172:
     14.23.4.1. Has the aircraft been approved by System Safety Engineering Analysis

   14.23.15. Proficiency, Certifying, and Decertifying Team Members. Unique requirements
   for hot refuel team members are outlined in Lead Command supplements.
14.24. Land Mobile Radio (LMR) Management.
   14.24.1. Maintenance Communications. Reliable, redundant, and effective communications
   systems are essential for efficient maintenance operations. These systems should provide
   accurate, timely, secure, programmable frequency and jam resistant communications needed
   to accomplish the maintenance mission in a fully deployed isolated mode. The MXG/MXW
   CC designated OPR has the overall responsibility to ensure adequate communications are
   available and manage the non-tactical radio program. Personnel will receive initial radio
   operating training before assuming duties involving radio operation AFI 33-106, AFMAN
   33-120, AFI 33-118, and AFI 33-202V1. For effective flightline operation, more non-tactical
   radio nets are authorized when large numbers or different types of weapon systems are
   assigned or when SAs so specify. The following general guidelines apply:
   14.24.2. Allowance for specific radios are shown in AS 660, Equipment Allowances for
   Non-Weapon Systems Communications Requirements, Repair Cycle Data Listing. Process
   requests for specific radio equipment to support maintenance activities IAW AFMAN 23-
   110, and AFI 33-106, AFMAN 33-120, AFI 33-118, and AFI 33-202. The Air Force
   Equipment Management System (AFEMS) web site is located at: https://
   www.afems.wpafb.af.mil/afems40/splash.html
   14.24.3. A VHF/UHF radio is authorized to provide communications between aircraft and
   maintenance. Aircrews may relay advance status information. Coordinate procedures for use
   of these radio communications with operations.
14.25. Lead Technician.
   14.25.1. Lead Technician (Lead Tech) Responsibilities. Units may choose to identify Lead
   Techs. A Lead Tech is the flight AFSC SME and represents all personnel in that AFSC.
   Their use is especially important where multiple AFSCs are integrated into sections. Units
   supporting different aircraft types may find it beneficial to identify Lead Techs for each
   MDS. Serving as a Lead Tech is considered an additional duty, not a duty title or full-time
   job. Lead Techs will:
       14.25.1.1. Work with the flight chief/section NCOICs to ensure personnel in the Lead
       Tech's AFSC receive proficiency training.
       14.25.1.2. Serve as the flight chief’s technical advisor for matters relating to their AFSC.
       14.25.1.3. Work with the flight chief/section NCOIC to ensure special tools and
       equipment utilized by personnel in their AFSC are serviceable and meet mission
       requirements.

       14.25.1.5. Evaluate trends and indicators of troubleshooting effectiveness and 2LM
       efficiency. Unit "Re-test OK" components (RTOK) are costly and often indicate
       opportunities to improve troubleshooting or repair processes. If available, RTOK data
       will be reviewed monthly for trends. Simple process improvements may result from
       emphasis on RTOK costs, more in-depth troubleshooting, or (circumstances permitting)
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               363


      reinstalling original LRUs when replacement LRUs drawn from supply do not fix the
      problem
14.26. MRT Procedures.
   14.26.1. The MXG/CC is responsible for deploying MRTs and equipment to recover aircraft
   at remote locations, as directed by this instruction and applicable Lead Command procedures
   (see Attachment 7-Attachment 9 for MRT chief checksheet). Unit resources, including
   personnel, supplies, and equipment, will be made available to support en route aircraft
   recoveries. The MXG/CC will:
      14.26.1.1. Ensure adequate equipment resources, as authorized by applicable AS, are
      available to perform remote aircraft recoveries.
      14.26.1.2. Ensure enough individuals are qualified to perform and complete all
      anticipated tasks, including IPI and Red X sign-offs. Consider the experience level of the
      individuals you select when the need is identified to troubleshoot repeat/recurring
      discrepancies, especially those that caused in-flight emergencies or involve safety of
      flight. The MXG/CC has the authority to grant approval for a single person to sign off
      their own work when only one individual deploys on an MRT IAW TO 00-20-1.
      14.26.1.3. Ensure sufficient numbers of personnel, across all maintenance AFSCs, have
      official government passports, as applicable, to reduce deployment limitations and ensure
      adequate support of MRT taskings.
      14.26.1.4. Ensure the MOC is informed of personnel and equipment deployed in MRTs
      and status of the recovery.
   14.26.2. (AETC) If an AETC aircraft (T-1, T-6, T-38) in Combat Systems Officer (CSO),
   UPT, SUPT, pilot instructor training, or introduction to fighter fundamentals becomes NMC
   while off station (other than at an Air Force base that has the capability), the closest AETC
   base having the maintenance capability for that specific MDS aircraft is responsible for
   providing necessary support (qualified personnel, equipment, specific technical data,
   components, supplies, etc.) to repair the aircraft and accomplish necessary flight
   preparedness inspections.
      14.26.2.1. (Added-AETC) Maintenance capability is defined as currently possessing
      and maintaining the specific MDS aircraft. For example, aircraft affected by a
      modernization program effort that become NMC while away from home station, the
      closest AETC base with the capability is responsible for supporting aircraft recovery.
      14.26.2.2. (Added-AETC) Vance AFB contract maintenance activity/operation will
      provide western region support for aircraft they have the maintenance capability to
      support as described in the contract.
      14.26.2.3. (Added-AETC) Use the defense table of official distances, the DoD official
      source of driving distance information (available at https://dtod.sddc.army.mil
   14.26.3. (Added-AETC) Units will dispatch required maintenance crews, supplies, TOs,
   SE, etc., as soon as possible, but not later than the close of business on the second normal
   duty day following notification. When multiple AETC aircraft require off-station support
   from a single base, priorities will be negotiated between the owning and supporting bases to
 364                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   minimize negative mission impacts. The owning and supporting bases will reconcile unique
   requirements (transportation, CANN, budget, etc.).
   14.26.4. (Added-AETC) Transient maintenance and the host maintenance organization will
   provide transient support and required maintenance for transient NMC aircraft at their
   location, according to AFI 21-101 if the capability exists.
   14.26.5. (Added-AETC) If a unit deploys/sends aircraft to another location for the purpose
   of flying sorties, the owning unit is responsible for recovering NMC aircraft at the deployed
   location. However, the owning unit may request/negotiate assistance at the operating
   location.
   14.26.6. (Added-AETC) The owning unit is responsible for recovering NMC aircraft that
   are outside the continental United States (CONUS). However, NMC aircraft that are en route
   within the CONUS will be recovered according to paragraph 14.26.2 (Added) of this
   supplement.
   14.26.7. (Added-AETC) AETC aircraft that do not fall in the categories identified in
   paragraph 14.26.2 (Added), will follow transient maintenance procedures in AFI 21-101.
14.27. Protective Aircraft Shelter (PAS) Environment. This section outlines general policies
and procedures prescribed by the SSEA for peacetime operations, and expanded aircraft
servicing, maintenance, and weapons loading in PAS. Guidance is provided for nose-in, nose
out, and ―double-stuff‖ using various aircraft operations and servicing.
   14.27.1. Procedures and Responsibilities. Use the information in this section, Lead
   Command instructions, AFOSHSTD 91-100, approved technical data, TO 00-25-172,
   specific TOs for aircraft servicing, equipment, and supply storage.
       14.27.1.1. The MXG/CC is responsible for PAS management at bases with permanently
       assigned aircraft, unless otherwise stipulated in contracting arrangements. If a PAS is
       used for other than its designed purpose, the using activity will return each PAS to its
       required readiness condition prior to receiving aircraft. Electrical equipment used for
       quality of life purposes must be designed for Class I Division 2 requirements as specified
       by the National Electrical Code. Equipment not meeting these requirements may be used
       only if they are powered by a dedicated circuit that can be de-energized during aircraft
       refueling by a single Class I Division 2 switch.
   14.27.2. PAS Marking. Develop permanent floor plans to reflect positions for fuel truck,
   aircraft, chocks, equipment, personnel cubicle, dispersed weapons, etc., for each style of PAS
   used. When double-stuffing aircraft, use a MXG/CC-approved option for aircraft positioning.
       14.27.2.1. Develop floor plans for augmentation forces and include in the units
       procedures supplementing this instruction.
       14.27.2.2. Paint aircraft taxi lines on the shelter access pad and continue into the PAS.
       Paint a yellow or red safety guideline for positioning fuel vehicles, beginning 10 feet
       from the shelter (outside) and extending into the shelter approximately 10 feet for
       refueling vehicles. Paint the safety guideline to align with the driver’s side of the vehicle,
       considering that the refuel vehicle will always be backed into the PAS.
   14.27.3. Electrical Requirements. Refer to TO 00-25-172, for second-and third-generation
   PAS. For first- and modified first-generation PAS, with aircraft placed on centerline in either
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                   365


  nose-in or -out configuration, leave electrical power and wall lights on. Do not change switch
  position until refueling is completed. Leave wall lights and under wing lights on if these
  lights are explosive-proof and the PAS is equipped with an operating ventilator.
  14.27.4. Refueling/Defueling Operations. Complete refuel/defuel servicing IAW technical
  data and criteria established in TO 00-25-172. During F-15 operations, the fuel truck may be
  positioned into the shelter during ammunition loading with the aircraft’s left engine running
  (nose-out configuration only), as long as no part of the fuel truck is directly in front of the F-
  15 gun firing line. Do not connect the fuel hose to the aircraft until the engine is shut down
  and the fuel truck is properly grounded.
  14.27.5. Shelter Doors. Aircraft are sheltered at the end of the duty day unless otherwise
  directed by local policies. Do not open PAS aircraft doors until ice, snow or debris is
  removed from the roller guide track and door roller path. Opening PAS aircraft doors with
  clogged door roller guides can cause severe damage to the door and door drive system.
  Ensure personnel have shelter door operating training before authorizing to operate.
     14.27.5.1. Fully open all PAS and exhaust/blast doors when aircraft engines are operated
     in the PAS. Recommend painting marks on the shelter walls/floors to indicate when at
     the fully open position.
     14.27.5.2. During real world situations when force protection measures are increased, or
     as directed by commanders, keep all PAS and exhaust/blast doors closed and secured to
     the greatest extent possible to protect critical assets.
     14.27.5.3. During strike-mission weapons loading operations for local exercises and
     higher HQ inspections, open PAS doors to the 10 foot mark, if applicable (depending on
     the style of door) and open one of the exhaust/blast doors while powered AGE or bomb
     lift vehicles are operating. If a PAS protecting critical assets is equipped with ventilation
     fans, BE will evaluate the local exhaust ventilation systems for predetermined operations
     inside a PAS with the doors closed to ensure no health hazard to personnel exists, then
     the PAS and exhaust/blast doors may be closed while powered AGE or bomb lift vehicles
     are operating.
     14.27.5.4. During normal operations, open PAS doors as specified in wing procedures, to
     facilitate safety, refueling, and ventilating hazardous exhaust vapors and fumes.
     Additionally, open PAS and exhaust/blast doors at least 50 percent when powered AGE
     is operated inside. With the approval of Wing Safety, PAS and exhaust/blast doors may
     remain closed during periods of inclement weather provided there is no safety risk, no
     refueling operation, no powered AGE operation, and no hazardous vapors/fumes risk
     within the PAS.
  14.27.6. Aircraft Engine Operation. Perform single-engine maintenance operations IAW
  MDS-specific guidance not to exceed 85 percent in the PAS. When performing engine
  ground operations on the apron outside the shelter, do not direct engine exhaust into the
  shelter.
  14.27.7. Aircraft Positioning inside the PAS. When positioning aircraft in a PAS for engine
  operations ensure aircraft is correctly positioned to accommodate safe operations and
  optimum engine performance.

  14.27.8. Aircraft Winching (Hot/Cold). Cold winch (aircraft engines not running) aircraft
  into the shelter using the appropriate aircraft technical data. If aircraft specific TOs do not
  exist, units will forward proposed cold-winching checklists to the Supported Command for
  approval prior to implementing. Hot-winching (aircraft engines are operating) is authorized
  provided an SSEA has been accomplished IAW AFOSHSTD 91-100.
      14.27.8.1. Base CE will set the winch configuration for the shelter based upon the
      primary assigned aircraft. Host units will develop a PAS facility maintenance program to
      ensure safe and efficient operations.
      14.27.8.2. Ensure personnel are not permitted aft of the aircraft main landing gear. This
      is considered a danger zone due to the possibility of winch cable breakage.
  14.27.9. Placement and Storage of Munitions in the PAS. Permit the placement or storage of
  munitions in a PAS only after carefully determining operational advantages to mission
  accomplishment. Site the PAS for explosives IAW AFMAN 91-201, and DoD 6055.9-STD,
  DoD Ammunition and Explosive Safety Standards. Determine the amount of munitions
  placed in a PAS based upon expected peacetime, exercise, and wartime taskings. In no case
  will the sited net explosive weight (NEW) limits be exceeded. Additional guidance on
  explosive compatibility, angled storage of munitions, and missile separation distances is in
  AFMAN 91-201, DoD 6055.9-STD, and AFI 91-112, Safety Rules for US Strike Aircraft.
      14.27.9.1. In the United Kingdom, each PAS must be licensed by the Royal Air Force in
      addition to complying with the requirements of AFMAN 91-201, and DOD 6055.9-STD.
      Elsewhere, obtain host-government concurrence, if necessary, before implementation.
         14.27.9.1.1. Before placing munitions inside a PAS, develop wing procedures to
         govern storage and movement operations. Group commanders jointly coordinate on
         wing procedures. The security police, CE, munitions flight, and weapons and
         explosives safety officers will assist in preparation of the wing guidance. The WG/CC
         and host nation commander, where applicable, will approve the procedures. Units will
         forward a courtesy copy of the procedures to applicable MAJCOM. Munitions will
         not be positioned inside a PAS until wing procedures have been approved.
      14.27.9.2. Conventional Munitions in the PAS. In addition to the requirements in
      AFMAN 91-201 and DoD 6055.9-STD, the following conditions also apply:
         14.27.9.2.1. General purpose bombs and cluster bomb units may be stored in a PAS.
         Fuze limited quantities (sufficient to meet minimum wartime taskings) provided they
         are periodically verified as ‖safe‖ by qualified munitions personnel (2W0XX or
         2W1XX). Verify the safety of fused munitions as follows:
             14.27.9.2.1.1. Upon initial delivery and positioning of munitions in PAS.
             14.27.9.2.1.2. After every download from an aircraft.
             14.27.9.2.1.3. When refueling with munitions positioned in PAS, provide fire
             protection IAW TO 00-25-172.
      14.27.9.3. Maintenance Actions for Emitting Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR).
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                  367


        14.27.9.3.1. Do not conduct aircraft maintenance requiring antenna radiation while
        AGM-88 missiles are located inside the PAS or located inside another PAS that is in
        line with the aircraft transmitting antenna.
        14.27.9.3.2. Comply with the safety requirements of technical data for electro-
        explosive devices, cluster bomb units, guided bombs, electronic fuses, missiles, etc.,
        to prevent detonation from EMR.
     14.27.9.4. Secure low-risk and medium-risk munitions stored in PAS IAW AFI 31-101,
     The Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-201, Security Police Standards
     and Procedures.
        14.27.9.4.1. Do not place missiles or munitions inside the PAS in direct line of the
        aircraft exhaust or within 5 feet of the PAS exhaust port opening. Place missiles in
        PAS on MMHE-approved missile stands (limit quantities to meet minimum wartime
        taskings), all up-round containers, or on munitions trailers. Establish procedures for
        detecting tampering with missiles positioned in a PAS. The maximum inspection
        interval is 7 days.
        14.27.9.4.2. Munitions pre-positioning for one SCL of air-to-ground or air-to-air
        munitions can be accommodated by available floor space within every PAS. Place
        munitions on Y-stands, wooden dunnage, or specially designed racks. Maximum total
        munitions to be pre-positioned within any PAS is dependent upon the NEW
        restriction for that PAS. The unit’s SCL governs the types of munitions pre-
        positioned in shelters.
        14.27.9.4.3. Quantities of air-to-air and air-to-ground missile racks vary, depending
        on the type of PAS. Generally, four missile racks (eight missiles) will fit into a first
        generation shelter. Eight missile racks will fit into a modified first-, second-, or third-
        generation shelter (total 16 missiles per shelter). Note: Missile racks must possess
        loading adapter straps providing durable, adjustable, positive locking for holding all
        types of missiles. Mount these racks to a single surface (PAS wall or PAS floor; not
        both) within the shelter. Secure missiles with straps at all times.
        14.27.9.4.4. Place missiles on MMHE-approved missile racks with the nose pointing
        toward the rear of the shelter. Maintain missile warhead separations IAW AFMAN
        91-201 and DoD 6055.9-STD. If missile warhead separation cannot be maintained,
        alternate missile positions; that is, nose-to-rear, nose-to-front. This should provide
        proper warhead alignment IAW AFMAN 91-201 and DoD 6055.9-STD and preclude
        any violations to sited NEW. Note: Descriptions identifying differences between PAS
        generations are in TO 00-25-172. Position missile racks as follows:
            14.27.9.4.4.1. In first generation shelters, position AIM-9 racks near the aircraft
            wings and forward of AIM-9 Launchers. This will enable the bomb lift truck to
            maneuver between the racks and the aircraft.
            14.27.9.4.4.2. In modified first generation shelters, position AIM-9 missile racks
            closest to the aircraft wings. The AIM-7/AIM-120 racks are positioned forward of
            the AIM-9 racks.
            14.27.9.4.4.3. In second and third generation shelters, position five to seven

             missile racks along the right wall and one missile rack along the left wall. Locate
             AIM-9 missile racks closest to the aircraft.
  14.27.10. Collocating Nuclear and Conventional Munitions (AF Munitions). Peacetime
  collocation of conventional munitions and nuclear weapons is not permitted. This does not
  include aircraft configured in an authorized strike configuration for a nuclear generation or
  alert operation. Refer to AFI 91-101 and applicable AFI 91-series for Weapons System
  Safety rules.
  14.27.11. External Fuel Tank Storage. Operational, empty aircraft fuel tanks may be stored
  within the shelters on fuel tank racks. Ground the fuel tanks IAW aircraft TOs and TO 00-25-
  172. Cover fuel standpipes and strap down the tanks. The quantity of fuel tanks to be stored
  inside of a shelter depends upon the assigned MDS and the type of shelter that the aircraft is
  operating from. Typically, the number of tanks and tank locations will follow below
  guidance but units may develop alternate procedures when approved by Wing Safety and
  Wing Civil Engineering. Ensure procedures are incorporated into supplements/OIs to this
  AFI.
      14.27.11.1. In first-generation shelters housing F-16 aircraft, two tanks are stored inside
      each shelter. Store the tanks one above the other in the rear of the shelter above the
      aircraft winch. Variations to this configuration may be required due to individual shelter
      layout.
      14.27.11.2. In modified first-generation shelters housing F-15 aircraft, and second and
      third-generation shelters housing F-15/F-16 aircraft, four external fuel tanks are stored
      inside each shelter. Position two tanks, one on top of the other, on sides of the shelter
      within the rear 25 feet of the shelter.

              waive requirements is structures don’t violate runway clear zones and are greater
              than 750 feet from runway center line. However, HQ AETC/A3 coordinates on
              waivers for structures within 750 feet of the runway center line.
                  14.27.12.3.2.21.1. (Added-AETC) Aircraft sun shelters that penetrate the
                  planes surfaces defined in UFC 3-260-01 must have red obstruction lights
                  installed IAW UFC 3-535-01. Solar lighting is not an acceptable option for
                  shelters that violate the runway primary surface (1000 feet of center line)
                  unless the intensity peak meets 30 – 50 candelas.
14.28. Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)/Radar Threat Warning (RTHW) Testing.
   14.28.1. Testing and Reporting. The MXG/CC will appoint a RWR/RTHW manager. The
   RWR/ RTHW manager will coordinate test procedures with the wing electronic warfare
   officer (EWO) and the MXS, if applicable. The RWR/RTHW manager will ensure each
   AMU accomplishes the required minimum number of checks as defined below.
       14.28.1.1. Every test will include a check of one signal per band and continuous wave
       (CW) if equipped.
       14.28.1.2. For contingency missions, check the RWR/RTHW on all applicable aircraft
       prior to first sortie of the day (or prior to placing on alert status). When an aircraft is
       found to have a malfunctioning RWR/RTHW system, the AC determines the course of
       action based on operational needs and requirements.
       14.28.1.3. For non-contingency missions, follow technical data or Lead Command
       guidance to determine the frequency and requirements. Where conflicts exist, adhere to
       most stringent guidance.
       14.28.1.3. (AETC) Perform periodic radar warning receiver/radar threat warning checks
       for noncontingency missions as outlined in applicable dash-6 TOs.
14.29. Ramp Inspection Program.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                  371


   14.29.1. Public Law 99-661 requires a pre-flight safety inspection of all internationally
   scheduled charter missions for the transportation of members of the Armed Forces departing
   the United States. Air Mobility Command (AMC) is lead for the DoD in the management and
   administration of the Ramp Inspection Program. The Ramp Inspection Program ensures all
   internationally chartered missions receive a pre-flight safety inspection IAW AMC
   Supplement 1 to AFI 21-101. AMC/A4M will coordinate with other MAJCOMs as required
   to accomplish ramp inspections to ensure the maximum efficiency and utilization of
   resources. When requested by AMC, MAJCOMs will provide support to reduce the TDY and
   manpower impact associated with the execution of this program.
14.30. Red Ball Maintenance.
   14.30.1. The term ―Red Ball‖ is a traditional descriptor, recognized throughout aircraft
   maintenance, and defines a situation requiring a sense of urgency and priority actions. ―Red
   Ball‖ maintenance normally occurs two hours prior to launch and until aircrew have released
   the aircraft back to maintenance. The Red Ball maintenance concept is intended to prevent
   late takeoffs and aborts by having qualified maintenance personnel available (e.g., in a truck
   or standby in the shop) during launch and recovery operations to troubleshoot, isolate, and
   repair system malfunctions. Red Ball maintenance in no way authorizes technicians to take
   shortcuts or deviate from TOs, personnel safety requirements or fail to properly document the
   aircraft forms and the MIS for all completed repair actions. Units will ensure all maintenance
   repair actions (does not apply to incorrect switch settings due to operator error) are
   documented in the aircraft forms and MIS during Red Ball, launch, or EOR operations and
   cleared from the aircraft forms prior to flight. Maintenance repair actions must be cleared in
   the MIS as soon as possible. It is imperative that maintenance documentation is performed
   regardless of the timing of the action in the generation and launching of the aircraft are input
   and cleared from the forms prior to flight. If aircraft status changes, an ER must be re-
   accomplished by a certified individual upon completion of maintenance and before the
   aircraft is released for flight IAW TO 00-20-1. Note: When the MIS is down, develop
   procedures to ensure the appropriate documentation is completed as soon as the system is
   operational.
   14.30.2. Red Ball Maintenance Procedures.
      14.30.2.1. TOs, tools, rags, parts, unused supplies and checklists will be accounted for
      before the aircraft is allowed to taxi/takeoff.
      14.30.2.2. Emphasis will be placed on FOD awareness/prevention during this critical
      maintenance operation.
   14.30.3. If aircraft engines are operating, a safety observer (maintenance or aircrew member)
   will maintain interphone communications or remain in full view of the flight crew and be
   positioned to maintain overall surveillance of the aircraft and personnel performing
   maintenance.
   14.30.4. Weapons loaded aircraft will be safed IAW applicable MDS and/or weapons
   specific technical data.
14.31. Scanning Electron Microscope/Energy Dispersive X-Ray (SEM/EDX) Master Chip
Detector Analysis Program (MCDP).

14.32. Self-Inspection Program.
   14.32.1. The purpose of the unit self-inspection program is to provide commanders and
   supervisors a management tool to assess unit compliance with existing directives. The self-
   inspection program is intended to be an on-going process implemented at all organizational
   levels. Lead Commands will establish standardized program guidelines IAW 90-201 and
   develop checklists that incorporate applicable HAF/Lead Command checklists and checklist
   items from local instructions. The self-inspection program not only enables units to gauge
   compliance with directives, but also provides a method to assess established processes,
   identify deficiencies, and implement corrective measures. Continuously assessing,
   measuring, and improving processes serves to improve mission effectiveness and efficiency
   and favorably postures units for higher HQ inspections.
   14.32.1. (AETC) LCAP checklists will be utilized for conducting self-inspections
       14.32.1.1. MXG/CC and SQ/CCs will conduct a unit self-inspection within 45 days
       (ARC MXG/ CC will determine requirement) of assuming command.
       14.32.1.1. (AETC) Group and squadron commanders will conduct a unit self-inspection
       at least annually IAW AFI 90-201.
   14.32.2. Program Guidelines: The unit self-inspection program must be tailored to the
   organization’s structure and mission. It should provide adequate coverage of the mission,
   resources, training, and people programs. Items not in compliance will be categorized as
   ―Critical‖ or ―Non-critical.‖ Problems identified should be categorized by mission impact
   and compliance with policies and efforts needed to fix problems. A feedback mechanism and
   reporting process will be established to ensure non-compliance items are tracked until
   resolved, waivered, or LIMFACs are reported formally. Maintain a formal copy of approval
   for waivered items. Open ―Critical‖ items will be reported to the MXG/CC, tracked, and
   status updated quarterly until resolved. Open ―Non-critical‖ items will be reported to the
   SQ/CC, tracked, and updated quarterly until resolved.
       14.32.2.1. Definition of Critical: Items identified as key result areas for successful
       mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where non-compliance
       would affect system reliability or result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, or
       litigation.
       14.32.2.2. Definition of Non-critical: Areas that require special vigilance and are
       important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical." Non-
       compliance could result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result
       in injury, unnecessary cost, or possible litigation.
       14.32.2.3. In addition to Lead Command checklists, use locally developed checklists
       tailored to specific unit requirements. AFOSHSTDs contain sample checklists for unit
       self-inspections. Use OSHA inspections for workplaces with civilian personnel. See AFI
       91-301.

   14.32.3. OSHA inspections of AF contractor operations within the 50 states and US
   territories are authorized. These operations are subject to the enforcement authority of federal
   and state safety and health officials. See AFI 91-301.
14.33. Senior Leaders’ Maintenance Course (SLMC).
   14.33.1. General. The AF Senior Leaders’ Maintenance Course (SLMC) is a Chief of Staff
   initiative developed to educate wing leadership on aircraft maintenance, operations, and
   flightline support in both expeditionary and home station environments. Its objectives
   include: strengthen the relationship and teamwork between operations, maintenance, and
   support; deepen insight into unit operations, maintenance, and support activities; and focus
   attention on policy, procedures, training, discipline, and enforcement.
   14.33.2. SLMC implementation instructions are as follows:
      14.33.2.1. Course is mandatory for Wing CC/CV, OG/CC/CD, MXG/CC/CD, and
      MSG/CC/CD (and all ALC equivalents) and must be completed within 6 months of
      assignment.
      14.33.2.2. Lead Command/CV must approve attendance waivers for any of the following
      issues:
      14.33.2.2. (AETC) AETC SLMC waiver requests will be initiated/routed thru the local
      installation wing commander, to 19 AF/CC, HQ AETC/A4/7 and AETC/CV for
      approval/disapproval.
          14.33.2.2.1. For those who have already attended SLMC in a different MAJCOM.
          14.33.2.2.2. For cancellations once an officer has received a course date.
          14.33.2.2.3. For officers unable to attend training within 6 months of assignment.
   14.33.3. Attendance and Scheduling: The Lead Command OPR will identify and schedule
   wing leaders and will work with the Lead Command/DPO to track attendance. The annual
   frequency of the course will be determined by Lead Commands based on the population of
   senior leaders. Personnel from ARC units can attend another Lead Command’s course.
   14.33.3. (AETC) The AETC OPR is HQ AETC/A4MM.
   14.33.4. Lead Command/CC (or CV in absence) sponsors and is expected to open the
   course.
   14.33.5. Lead Command/A4 (or equivalent) will normally plan and host the course, attend
   throughout, and present key briefings.
   14.33.6. Other briefings may be conducted by a SME. The briefer should be at least a
   colonel or civilian equivalent. A lower-ranking SME may brief by exception.

   14.33.8. Optional topics: Deployment and AEF support issues , Base X case study,
   FOD/DOP, aircraft appearance, maintenance manning and retention, workforce management,
   propulsion, weapons system teams and roadmap, AF Munitions, DCC Program and RNI.
14.34. Special Certification Roster (SCR). The SCR is a management tool providing
supervisors a clear and concise listing of personnel who have been appointed to perform,
evaluate, and/or inspect work of a critical nature. Normally, only maintenance requirements that
have a definite potential for personnel injury or damage to equipment shall be included in the
SCR. Other tasks requiring special training or qualifications may be managed on the SCR. The
SCR is used to build personnel rosters for deployments, shift schedules, and assess workforce
capability.
   14.34.1. MXG/CC approves specific items identified in Table 14.1 Note 1.
       14.34.1.1. The MOO/MX SUPT (MXG/CC for ANG) approves individuals in their
       primary AFSC based on their experience and technical expertise regardless of their
       assigned skill position. Seven-skill level personnel may be certified outside their primary
       AFSC only when specific CUT task qualification is documented in their training records.
       Exception: WWM will approve WS SCRs. MXG/CEM approves SCR actions for those
       individuals administratively assigned to MOS (QA, AFREP, etc.) and FTD personnel
       (N/A to the ARC).
       14.34.1.2. The AFE Superintendent approves 1P0X1, AFE personnel in their primary
       AFSC based on their experience and technical expertise regardless of their assigned skill
       position. AFE personnel certified to clear "Red-X‖ discrepancies will be annotated on the
       SCR, or as determined by applicable Lead Commands. AFE sections will also follow AFI
       11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program and Lead Command directives.
       See Table 14.1 for SCR requirements.
       14.34.1.3. The SCR must be reviewed and signed semi-annually by the MOO/MX
       SUPT/AFE SUPT (MXG/CC for ARC) to verify all entries are current and accurate and
       to ensure task certifications have been completed. Exception: WWM will review and sign
       WS SCRs. MXG/CEM will review and sign SCR actions for those individuals
       administratively assigned to MOS (QA, AFREP, etc.) and FTD personnel.
   14.34.2. The MXG/CC can authorize selected 5-skill level personnel, in the rank of SrA or
   higher, for tasks normally requiring a 7-skill level requirement to facilitate the production
   effort. Waived 5-skill level personnel should be closely monitored and kept to the minimum
   required to accomplish the maintenance mission. MOO/MX SUPT or equivalent must
   maintain file copies of approved waivers. Approved waiver file copies may be discarded if
   SCR specifically identifies task as waived in the MIS. (ARC: must be maintained by MX
   supervision or equivalent until the SCR is updated and signed by the MXG/CC). Certified
   weapons load crew chiefs (load crew member position number 1) by virtue of their task
   certification and position serve as inspectors for weapons loading tasks only and do not
   require waiver. (2W0XX Certified Munitions Inspectors are exempt from these
   requirements.) Inspectors are CFETP qualified and appointed by the munitions flight chief or
   commander IAW AFI 21-201 and TO 11A-1-10, Air Force Munitions Surveillance Program
   and Serviceability Procedures. Note: The OG/CC approves AFE personnel skill level waivers
   upon recommendation of the AFE Superintendent and MXG coordination.

       14.34.2.1. Lead Command Waiver Policy. If local conditions require assignment of
       other than mandatory SCR grade (to include civilian equivalents) and skill level
       prerequisite requirements, and cannot be fulfilled using the MXG/CC authority stated in
       14.34.2 then the MXG/CC (or equivalent) must request a waiver from the Lead
       Command.
    14.34.3. Lead Commands add other mandatory critical tasks or inspections they deem
    necessary. Identify each task on the SCR by a specific course code.
    14.34.4. SCR Documentation. Flight and section NCOICs will review each individual’s
    qualifications prior to recommending approval to perform SCR tasks to the appropriate
    approval level. The AF IMT 2426, Training Request and Completion Notification or Lead
    Command-approved (ANG locally approved) form is used by the work center supervisor to
    add or remove an individual to the SCR. Additionally, removal from the SCR may be
    accomplished by lining through the task on the SCR and notifying training section to update
    the MIS. The appropriate level approves the individual for addition to the SCR. On approval,
    the training management function loads the approved name into the MIS. Flight and section
    NCOICs retain their copy of AF IMT 2426 or Lead Command approved form until they
    verify proper loading. Appointment letters are not required if loaded in MIS.
    14.34.4. (AETC) Units may use AETC Form 666, Change to Inspector/Special
    Certification Listing.
       14.34.4.1. Work center supervisor, AMU/flight supervision, MOO/MX SUPT, SQ/ CC,
       or MXG/CC may decertify individuals at any time and remove them from the SCR.
    14.34.5. Ensure a current copy of the SCR is taken on all deployments.

14.35. WRM External Nestable Fuel Tank Build-Up (NFTBU).
     14.35.1. External NFTBU is a wartime capability through a UTC to provide a critical
     wartime skill that compensates for the expenditure of aircraft fuel tanks (refer to Chapter 5 of
     this instruction). With exception of the core 2A6X4 personnel, augmentees may come from
     any Group or Squadron within the Wing. Units must adhere to the direction outlined in their
     particular MISCAP statement and DOC statement governing the quantity, size, and
     composition of fuel tank build-up teams. Refer to AFI 90-201 for additional
     evaluation/inspection guidance. (PACAF Only: Korean Peninsula bases are not required to
     maintain standing tank buildup teams with augmentees and are relieved of the requirement to
     demonstrate fuel tank build-up. These bases are still responsible for maintaining the
     equipment/tools required to perform tank build-up, developing a plan/capability to form/train
     tank build-up teams, and maintain built-up/nested WRM tanks).
     14.35.2. All UDM must ensure personnel tasked/selected for WRM NFTBU team
     augmentees are not tasked for other wartime UTCs. The UDM responsible for deploying
     2A6X4 personnel is the focal point for team assembly and must maintain a written plan. The
     plan must be kept current, reviewed annually and must contain the following:
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                             381


      14.35.2.1. Specific manning positions across the wing to be tasked as NFTBU team
      augmentees. (The applicable independent NFTBU UTC MANFOR shall be used as a
      guide to construct the teams)
      14.35.2.2. Guidelines for activation of the tank build-up teams.
14.36. 406 MHz Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Systems.
   14.36.1. Aircraft maintenance functions must register and track status of fixed-mounted
   aircraft 406 MHz Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) systems.
      14.36.1.1. Ensure all 406 MHz ELT systems in service are registered in the NOAA
      registration database readily accessible to Rescue authorities worldwide at
      https://beaconregistration.noaa.gov/rgdb.
         14.36.1.1.1. In accordance with DoD policy, USAF 406 MHz ELT systems will also
         be registered in the DoD JSETS database. The POC for JSETS registration is the
         Personnel      Recovery     Mission      Software    (PRMS)       Help    Desk
         (jodt305c@jricp.osis.gov). Use of an alternate registration database should be
         approved by the governing agency in charge of the JSETS database. The governing
         agencies are the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) and the Electronic
         Services Command at Hanscom AFB, MA.
         14.36.1.1.2. Registration information must include, as a minimum, accurate point of
         contact information for the appropriate command post/command and control (C2)
         functions responsible for response to beacon alert messages. Refer to AFI 10-207,
         Command Posts for Command Post or C2 function responsibilities regarding 406
         MHz ELT and Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) systems.
         14.36.1.1.3. Notification must be given to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
         Administration (NOAA) SARSAT program Office’s National Beacon Registration
         Database (RGDB) that a beacon, or block of beacons, is registered with JSETS. This
         notification     is       made      through      the        following      website:
         (https://beaconregistration.noaa.gov/rgdb).
      14.36.1.2. Ensure procedures are established to update the ELT registration database
      whenever 406 MHz ELT–equipped aircraft are transferred to other commands/wings,
      ELTs that are taken out of service, removed for maintenance or destroyed.
      14.36.1.3. Ensure 406 MHz ELT system tracking procedures are established to provide
      readily accessible, accurate ELT status (including aircraft assignment and, when able,
      location) to the responsible command post/C2 functions.
14.37. Lead Commands will establish an IFF Mode IV Program.
   14.37.1. The MXG/CC will appoint an IFF Mode IV program manager.
      14.37.1.1. 100 percent of IFF-equipped possessed aircraft will be checked every 2
      months or as determined by aircraft specific technical data.
      14.37.1.2. Invalid Mode IV replies will not cause a CONUS training sortie to be aborted;
      however, a work order will be generated for maintenance after flight.
382                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


      14.37.1.3. Do not launch or enter aircraft into a contingency zone with a known
      inoperative Mode IV system, unless the contingency Area of Responsibility (AOR) has
      established procedures governing inoperative/degraded Mode IV capabilities.
      14.37.1.4. Lead Commands will determine additional requirements, as necessary, to
      ensure status of IFF Mode IV meets mission requirements.
14.38. (Added-AETC) AETC Training Groups:
  14.38.1. (Added-AETC) Technical Training Wing Responsibilities. This section does not
  apply to Training Detachments (TDs) (see paragraph 14.38.4 (Added)). In general,
  maintenance policy and procedures are developed and focused on maintenance activities
  supporting operational aircraft and (or) equipment and wing, group, squadron activities and
  environments. The AETC technical training mission, duties and responsibilities are
  significantly different than operational units because they train with non-
  operational/grounded equipment and aircraft. Therefore, training group commanders will
  develop a separate instruction that prescribes the maintenance policy and procedures
  necessary to implement AFI 21-101 and this supplement in a training environment.
  Coordinate the instruction with HQ AETC/A4M prior to implementation. The instruction
  will address, to the maximum extent practical, how maintenance programs and the
  requirements of AFI 21-101 and this supplement will be applied while executing the
  technical training mission. The instruction must clearly articulate and acknowledge the
  unique differences between a maintenance group maintaining operational aircraft/equipment
  and one maintaining non-operational aircraft/equipment in an academic environment. The
  instruction must also identify the duties and responsibilities the training group will follow to
  meet the requirements of AFI 21-101 without mandating/requiring unnecessary and clearly
  non-value added tasks to be accomplished. As a minimum, the instruction will address
  functional responsibilities (e.g., AGE, munitions); technical order management and use;
  tools, equipment accountability and management; forms and documentation; FOD; and
  safety. Note: See paragraph 4.10.6 (Added) for specific armament contractor
  responsibilities for trainer maintenance activities at Sheppard AFB. While this policy
  provides wide latitude, caution must be taken to avoid disregard of program management
  responsibilities for the sake of simplicity that could hinder effective program management
  and decrement the "train as we fight" methodology employed in technical training. For
  example, while TCTOs must be reviewed for applicability, accomplished and managed, it's
  not reasonable to mandate all TCTO management requirements applicable to operational
  aircraft be applied to permanently grounded GITA to the same degree. Delayed discrepancy
  program management is another example of an area that may need local modification to
  execute efficiently and appropriately for permanently grounded GITA.
  14.38.2. (Added-AETC) Trainer Maintenance Responsibilities. Trainer maintenance
  managers are responsible for managing the maintenance function. They will:
      14.38.2.1. (Added-AETC) Ensure support for the maintenance mission is included in
      plans, programs, and host tenant agreements.
      14.38.2.2. (Added-AETC) Ensure training equipment is operational to training
      requirements.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 383


     14.38.2.3. (Added-AETC) Coordinate on the monthly training schedule (when it is
     published separately from the maintenance plan).
     14.38.2.4. (Added-AETC) Coordinate items of equipment exempt from annual
     inspection requirements with the functional director or commander prior to approval.
     14.38.2.5. (Added-AETC) Ensure applicable AETC trainer maintenance goals and
     standards are met.
     14.38.2.6. (Added-AETC) Develop an instruction, if not already included in the
     instruction required by paragraph 14.38.1 of this instruction, to address the following
     functions/programs:
         14.38.2.6.1. (Added-AETC) Programs and policies contained in AFI 21-101,
         Chapter 1.
         14.38.2.6.2. (Added-AETC) MOC.
         14.38.2.6.3. (Added-AETC) Quality assurance or control.
         14.38.2.6.4. (Added-AETC) Supply support.

         14.38.2.6.11. (Added-AETC) Documentation
         14.38.2.6.12. (Added-AETC) Unique maintenance procedures.
         14.38.2.6.13. (Added-AETC) Logistics support for training devices designed or
         manufactured by AETC.
             14.38.2.6.13.1. (Added-AETC) Training equipment developed by AETC (or
             other command trainer development activities) will be maintained according to
             the technical manuals supplied by the trainer development activity.
             14.38.2.6.13.2. (Added-AETC) Inspect trainers with no established inspection
             requirements annually unless specifically exempted by the commander. Maintain
             a master listing of items exempt from inspection requirements and review
             annually. The QA function will maintain source documents for exempt items.
  14.38.3. (Added-AETC) Training School. Training equipment will normally be assigned to
  the training school. Training school personnel will perform required operator or user
  inspections per applicable technical data and Air Force and AETC directives. Training school
  personnel may also perform minor maintenance (such as replacing fuses and lamps,
  tightening nuts and bolts, and cleaning) within the limitations of available tools and technical
  data.
384                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012

  manage the local planning, scheduling, controlling, and directing of maintenance in support
  of that mission.
      14.38.4.1. (Added-AETC) TD Responsibilities. TDs will accomplish maintenance for
      equipment assigned in support of the training mission, and TD personnel will perform all
      maintenance within their capability. Maintenance assistance beyond TD capability may
      be requested according to this publication and applicable 00-series TOs. Each TD will
      perform the functions of maintenance operations and QA to the degree required for
      effective maintenance management. The host commander will provide additional support
      in these areas as outlined in this supplement and as negotiated in support agreements. As
      a minimum, TDs will:
         14.38.4.1.1. (Added-AETC) Ensure sound and effective maintenance practices are
         implemented within the TD. Institute a maintenance management program
         designating TD instructor responsibilities in specified areas to ensure timely and

available through AETC, units must use interagency training before considering nongovernment
training sources. If courses in both of these sources are not available, units must establish a
documented training program that meets the intent of this AFI. The program must provide for
training by the most qualified personnel and must be approved by the MFM prior to
implementation.
16.12. Egress Systems Inspections and Documentation:
   16.12.1. A certified egress production inspector will inspect any disturbed integral part of
   the egress system. The inspection must be an egress final inspection unless another
   inspection is prescribed by technical data.
   16.12.1. (AETC) Egress section personnel must ensure acceptance inspection requirements
   according to TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation,
   Policy and Procedures, are completed on newly assigned aircraft or aircraft returning from
   depot.
   16.12.2. If an insufficient number of egress production inspectors are assigned, the group
   commander may grant waivers to highly qualified five-level egress journeymen, in the rank
   of SrA or higher, to perform as egress production inspectors. Waived journeymen will be
   closely monitored and kept to the minimum required to accomplish the maintenance mission.
   16.12.3. All systems Red X provisions. Only egress personnel will clear (sign off) egress
   system discrepancies.
   16.12.4. Egress personnel will conduct an egress final every 30 days on ejection seats whose
   personnel/recovery parachutes and/or survival kits are integral parts of the seat. Egress
   personnel will also conduct an egress final when any maintenance other than a visual
   inspection is performed on an integral part of an ejection seat.
   16.12.4. (AETC) If egress final inspections are not performed in conjunction with aircrew
   life support 30-day inspections, egress supervisors will establish procedures with plans and
   scheduling to ensure no aircraft goes overdue on an inspection.
   16.12.5. Cannibalization actions
   16.12.5. (DELETED-AETC)
       16.12.5.1. Egress system component CAD/PAD cannibalization actions are considered
       "High-Risk" and should not be performed unless priority aircraft are involved (i.e. higher
       headquarters/alert status), or lack of ready equipment will impede mission
       accomplishment.
       16.12.5.2. To ensure system integrity and validation of the explosive CAD/PAD listing,
       cannibalization of egress explosive components and/or seats will not be accomplished
       without the approval of the Maintenance Group or Deputy Group Commander.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                  403


       16.12.5.3. After cannibalization actions, Red X discrepancies in the aircraft AFTO IMT
       781A will not be cleared until the MIS 257 & 701 screens are verified. (2A6X3) Egress
       personnel will accomplish this action.
16.13. Aircraft Static Display. Aircraft placed on static display must be rendered safe in
accordance with 00-80G-series technical orders and AFMAN 91-201.
16.14. Technical Assistance. When escape system damage/repairs exceed technical order
limits request maintenance assistance IAW TO 00-25-107 through the appropriate Lead
Command weapon system manager (with an informational copy to the Lead Command egress
system manager) to 77 AESG , Brooks City Base TX at the following web site;
https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/ClosedCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-MC-44
(Exception F-22A, T-6, and U-2).
16.15. Training Aircraft. Safe aircraft utilized for local maintenance training, fire department
training, and aircrew extraction training in accordance with aircraft-specific technical orders. If
technical order procedures do not exist, contact the Lead Command for guidance.
16.15. (AETC) Training Aircraft. For T-6 aircraft, the egress system will be made safe for
fire department training and aircrew extraction training by using tie-straps to lock the ejection
handle safety pin to the ejection handle.
16.16. Conferences:
   16.16.1. The 2A6X3 Air Force career field manager, 2A6X3 MFMs, and the egress systems
   program manager will attend the Aircrew Performance Working Group.
   16.16.2. The 311 HSW Egress System Program Manager will establish a charter and
   conduct the Aircrew Egress Systems Executive Working Group (AESEWG) at least
   annually. The intent of this working group is to foster a spirit of cooperation, keep lines of
   communication open, and resolve Aircrew Protection issues that are cross functional in
   nature and forward appropriate issues to Air Staff. The program manager will also conduct a
   Worldwide Aircrew Egress Systems Workshop at least biennially.

                                          Chapter 17

                      CENTRALIZED REPAIR FACILITIES (CRFS)

17.1. Introduction. CRFs, previously also called centralized intermediate repair facilities
(CIRFs), queen bees, etc, consolidate non-mission generation workloads for commodities such as
aircraft engines, electronic warfare pods, avionics line replaceable units, wheel and tire
assemblies, and other aircraft components. Management and control procedures will vary
depending on the specific logistical characteristics of the asset/commodity being repaired as well
as the type of aircraft and geographic region supported.
17.2. Organization. CRFs are normally established within existing maintenance organizations
(EMS, CMS, MXS), minimizing requirements for overhead and support.
17.3. Command Authority. CRF production oversight and monitoring is provided by a CRF
Command and Control (C2) Cell within the AFGLSC/Supporting Command Supply Chain
Management Group (SCMG). This cell will:
   17.3.1. Develop CRF policy in conjunction with Air Staff and MAJCOM staff agencies.
   17.3.2. Monitor CRF production.
   17.3.3. Prioritize and direct CRF commodity distribution within the enterprise IAW AF
   guidance.
   17.3.4. Coordinate and track retrograde and sustainment assets between supported units and
   the CRF.
   17.3.5. Utilize IT systems in conjunction with Supply Chain Weapon System Teams to
   determine enterprise health of all CRF commodities. Alert lead command of negative trends.
   17.3.6. Monitor transportation and repair pipeline velocity and intervene as needed.
   17.3.7. Identify and upchannel systemic policy driven transportation and supply difficulties
   to appropriate higher headquarters for resolution.
   17.3.8. Provide accurate and timely commodity appropriate status reports and metrics.
17.4. CRF Common Operating Picture (COP). Logistics and maintenance managers need
accurate and timely information to make command and control decisions over CRF activities.
To provide this information, a CRF COP has been established on the AF Portal to integrate
numerous legacy data systems with CRF decision support tools. Machine-to-machine interface
should be maximized to reduce duplicate manual data entry and the opportunity for induced
errors. The AF Portal, rather than direct office-to-office e-mail will be used to communicate
COP information to all CRF stakeholders.
17.5. Rotable Pools. Customer wait time (CWT) and transportation constraints may drive the
establishment of a centralized rotable pool (CRP) for Class VII end items such as engines and
pods to meet established weapons system availability goals. Use of a CRP reduces CWT by
maximizing timely placement of serviceable assets where they are needed most, in lieu of
waiting for the same item to be received, repaired, and shipped back to the originating supported
unit. Rotable pool size, compared to support unit spare levels, will be determined during
deliberate planning between appropriate SCMG CRF C2 and Lead Commands.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                405


17.6. Wing-Retained Tasks. Units supported by CRFs may retain a limited capability to
perform specific ILM necessary for mission generation. These wing-retained tasks and the
resources required to perform them (personnel, equipment, etc.) will be approved by Lead
Command and coordinated with the AFGLSC (every effort will be made to minimize and
standardize wing-retained tasks where possible). For constrained assets, wing-retained tasks
may include those performed within the expected turnaround time of the CRF pipeline and repair
times. Wing-retained task resources also provide capability for cannot-duplicate screening and
provide a local means to handle immediate or urgent-action TCTOs which would otherwise
require the dispatch of a CRF team or the return of all affected assets to the CRF.
   17.6.1. Cannibalization at supported units. When commodity LRU local retail stocks fall
   below mission requirements, retention of CRF-repaired end-items as ―CANN assets‖ may be
   necessary. However, this should be the exception, and must be approved by the appropriate
   SCMG CRF C2 in coordination with the supported command Functional Manager. CRF C2
   will notify supporting unit of retained CANN asset.
17.7. Documentation. The CRF and supported units will maintain all required status,
inventory, and historical record documentation on CRF-repaired assets, including manual
methods, IMDS-CDB, G081, CEMS, RAMPOD, etc.
   17.7.1. Pod asset inventory, status and reporting requirements. CRFs and supported units
   will update RAMPOD daily in accordance with AFI 21-103 Chapter 10 AVIONICS POD
   SYSTEM INVENTORY, STATUS AND UTILIZATION REPORTING to include Tracking
   Control Numbers (TCN) and/or commercial carrier name if applicable as well as shipment
   date of transitory assets. Shipping container status and locations are maintained in
   RAMPOD and must be kept current by users.
17.8. Metrics. CRFs will report performance against various customer and production metrics
approved by Lead Command and coordinated with the AFGLSC. These may include customer
wait time; spares status; MICAP incidents/hours; average time on wing; production versus
requirement throughput; supply status; flow time; test station/test cell status; pipeline segment
times; and others as required. This data will be provided daily to CRF C2 as outlined in para.
16.8.1.
17.9. Liaison with Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS). CRF operations rely on a robust
relationship between maintenance, materiel management, and transportation. CRF pipeline
velocity must be sustained at a level supporting unit requirements. The host LRS with support
from the maintenance organization (EMS, CMS, MXS) will jointly establish written procedures
to ensure the rapid movement of retrograde and sustainment assets between the CRF and
supported units. CRF C2 Cell will maintain maintenance, transportation, and supply functional
experts to assist CRFs and supported units to resolve any maintenance, supply, and
transportation limitations.
17.10. Agile Combat Support (ACS) Planning. Deployed CRFs are highly scenario-
dependent. Considerations include: allocated deployment airlift; number of aircraft deploying;
number of forward operating locations (FOL); available CRF throughput and surge capacity;
spares levels; transportation modes and nodes; and force protection and other FOL factors. The
availability of intra- and inter-theater transportation will play a major role in determining the
feasibility of arranging CRF support.
406                          AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


  17.10.1. CRFs do not replace deployable intermediate-level maintenance, but work in
  concert with it. Depending on the scenario, a unit may be tasked to deploy all, some, or none
  of its ILM capability to the FOL or to the CRF at a forward support location (FSL) or
  CONUS support location (CSL).
  17.10.2. CRFs may be established to repair virtually any commodity and may include minor
  or major maintenance. Definitions of CRF support and retained tasks may vary from
  CONUS arrangements. All options should be considered to arrive at the best support concept
  for the supported commander.
  17.10.3. Modular, Scalable Organization. Lead commands will establish modular, scalable
  UTCs for CRF commodities to provide a tailored response for various deployment trigger
  points. UTC capabilities will range from CRF augmentation to establishing a new CRF at
  bare base locations. When CRFs are established by consolidating intermediate-level
  maintenance from several supported units, those units’ UTC requirements will transfer
  (devolve) to the CRF maintenance organization (EMS, CMS, MXS). Supported unit (flying
  unit) DOC statements and UTC MISCAP statements may need to be revised to accurately
  reflect mobility-tasked direct support units and their capabilities.
  17.10.4. AEF Planning and Execution. The lead wing MXG/CC will determine maintenance
  ACS requirements, to include CRFs. Except for extenuating circumstances, CRFs should be
  utilized to the maximum practical extent. Deploying ILM to the FOL should be avoided
  when possible. To minimize airlift requirements, the lead wing MXG/CC should ensure
  deploying units tailor their UTCs with respect to supporting CRF capabilities and
  prepositioned assets.
      17.10.4.1. CRF support requirements identified prior to unit deployment should be
      forwarded to the MAJCOM and CRF-supporting command and the AFGLSC (SCMG
      CRF C2). CRF support should also be an item of discussion at the AEF Planning
      Conference. Requirements identified after unit deployment should be forwarded through
      the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR)/A4 staff to the supporting command
      and the AFGLSC (SCMG CRF C2).
      17.10.4.2. The CRF supporting command will determine the best location for the CRF,
      appropriate spare levels, equipment, personnel, and CONOPS for each type of asset.
      These requirements and CONOPS should be reviewed and coordinated with supported
      commands every AEF cycle or as requirements dictate to ensure the best utilization of
      AF/DoD resources.
      17.10.4.3. The supporting SCMG will establish a CRF C2 Cell consisting of
      maintenance, transportation, and materiel management functional experts to perform C2
      functions in a supported/supporting relationship over applicable CRFs. The AF Portal
      should be used to report, track, monitor, and measure CRF commodities and operations.
      17.10.4.4. The supported COMAFFOR/A4 staff may designate a liaison element to
      coordinate with the CRF supporting command and applicable SCMG to determine the
      most expedient means to satisfy supported unit requirements.      The supported
      COMAFFOR/A4 has final authority on asset distribution to units under its OPCON.
      Where two or more COMAFFORs compete for CRF-repaired assets, the A4 staffs,
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               407


     supporting command, and applicable SCMG CRF C2 will reach agreement on
     distribution of serviceable assets to balance competing operational requirements.
     17.10.4.5. Gaining CRF Requirements. Gaining CRFs will analyze their maintenance
     capability against supported unit expected sortie and utilization rates to determine
     maximum surge production capability, with and without augmentation. Augmentation
     requirements for various trigger points (e.g., PAA deployed), along with any projected
     personnel and equipment shortfalls or LIMFACs (limiting factors) should be reported to
     the supported (owning) MAJCOM FAM. The Functional Area Manage (FAM) will
     review and forward requirements to the lead wing and AEF Center for tasking/resolution
     at the Planning Conference. If during execution, CRF performance or other factors (e.g.,
     lack of sufficient timely intra- or inter-theater airlift) prevent fulfillment of combatant
     command support requirements, the supported command, supporting command, and
     applicable SCMG CRF C2 will explore other options to support the FOL.
        17.10.4.5.1. Gaining CRFs will review their CHPMSK levels to determine if they are
        adequate to support deploying units and will request appropriate adjustments, as
        necessary. The supporting command LSC will assist with kit management and
        replenishment.
        17.10.4.5.2. Gaining CRFs and the CRF C2 cell will closely monitor distribution of
        serviceable assets among CRPs.
     17.10.4.6. Deploying Unit Requirements.
        17.10.4.6.1. Deploying units will segregate Readiness Spares Package (RSP) items
        supporting a ―remove, repair, and replace‖ capability and will deploy with the RSP
        according to the applicable UTC package. Depending on the supporting CRF
        manning and equipment posture, personnel and equipment may need to be deployed
        to the CRF.
        17.10.4.6.2. Deploying units operating with CRF-repaired pods will tailor spare asset
        packages to match the expected CRF level of support.
        17.10.4.6.3. Except for approved retained tasks, deploying units will operate under
        the CRF concept, maximizing use of the RSP and CRF support. For CRF operations
        to be successful and meet deployed unit expected customer wait times, units must
        prepare unserviceable assets for shipment as soon as repair at the CRF is deemed
        warranted. Retention of ―CANN assets‖ at supported units must be approved by the
        appropriate SCMG CRF C2 in coordination with the supported command Functional
        Manager.
        17.10.4.6.4. Shipping Containers. CRF support relationships require assets to be
        shipped between deployed locations and the CRF. Deploying units will deploy with
        sufficient reusable containers to transport assets to and from the CRF.
        17.10.4.6.5. Redeploying supported units will coordinate closely with the applicable
        SCMG CRF C2 and supported MAJCOM staff to ensure unserviceable CRF
        supported commodities/assets are not left at the FOL. As a supported unit nears the
        end of its deployment, resupply times should be considered prior to shipping
408                         AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


         serviceable/unserviceable assets. If the supported unit cannot be resupplied before
         redeployment, they will redeploy with the unserviceable asset.
  17.10.5. CRF EXPRESS Tool. CRF EXPRESS automatically drives induction of NSN
  listed assets through Enterprise Solution-Supply (ES-S) daily across the enterprise.
      17.10.5.1. The applicable CRF C2 cell will monitor EXPRESS, ES-S and all applicable
      applications daily; they will also recommend manual inductions of LRUs to fulfill
      shortfalls in the pipeline across the enterprise.
      17.10.5.2. Based on mission needs, manual intervention of EXPRESS managed
      commodities will be directed by the applicable SCMG CRF C2 Cell as required using
      locally developed procedures in-line with current IT capability.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                 409


                                          Chapter 18

                              CONTRACT SURVEILLANCE

18.1. Government Contract Quality Assurance. See Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
Part 46. Successful contract performance is dependent upon positive open communication
between the Procuring Contracting Officer / Administrative Contracting Officer (PCO/ACO),
Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE), and the performance-based activity. It is imperative that all
parties strive to achieve and maintain an atmosphere of mutual understanding and cooperation.
Successful strategies may include regularly scheduled meetings between the government
program management office personnel and the performance-based activity to discuss inspection
results, trends, and other items of mutual interest. The QAE and performance-based activity are
not adversaries; they are partners who share the same goal - successful mission accomplishment.
Note: for the purposes of this instruction QAE is synonymous with quality assurance
representative (QAR), contracting officers technical representative (COTR), and contracting
officers representative (COR).
   18.1.1. MAJCOMs shall designate a program management function, i.e., government
   program management office, to oversee and manage the requirements for each contract
   management plan. For the purposes of this instruction the Continuing Government
   Organization (CGO) required In Accordance With (IAW) Office of Management and Budget
   (OMB) Circular A-76 is synonymous with government program management office. The
   government program office is the single focal point for the performance-based activity to
   communicate performance results, identify issues beyond their control, and solicit guidance
   and interpretations.
   18.1.1. (AETC) HQ AETC/A4PM (HQ AETC/A4MA for CLS contracts) is the designated
   program management function.
   18.1.2. (Added-AETC) CLS Contract Management. CLS contracts outline QAE duties and
   responsibilities that are in addition to the requirements contained in AFI 21-101. These duties
   and responsibilities are further defined by the individual ACO and are delegated to senior Air
   Force representatives at each main operating base that utilizes the weapon system. Aircraft
   CLS contracts vary slightly between weapon systems, depending on the supplies and services
   provided by the CLS contractor. For the purposes of this supplement, CLS contracts are
   identified as full or partial CLS. A weapon system is considered using full CLS when a
   single contractor provides both on- and off-equipment maintenance support. A partial CLS
   contract provides only off-equipment maintenance support through COMBS. CLS QAEs
   identify inspection requirements, which meet the criteria of observation work areas, and
   develop evaluation guides for each area.
       18.1.2.1. (Added-AETC) The FC and QAE must have a thorough understanding of the
       CLS concept to fulfill their duties. As a minimum, they must have a copy of the contract
       and the applicable SOW. They must also understand the differences between site services
       maintenance contracts and CLS contracts, and the interface of the two when they support
       one weapon systems at one location. Note: For the purposes of this instruction, the terms
       SOW and performance work statement (PWS) are synonymous.
410                          AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


  18.1.3. (AETC) Surveillance Requirements. This paragraph identifies specific surveillance
  requirements particular to CLS contracts.
      18.1.3.1. (Added-AETC) The C-21 is supported by full CLS contract. Specific
      technical and observation work area surveillance requirements for C-21 contracts are in
      the applicable ACO-approved performance plan. Additionally, QAEs use the forms
      prescribed by these publications to document surveillance.
      18.1.3.2. (Added-AETC) QAEs surveilling full CLS contracts will use the PWS/SOW,
      the contractor’s quality control (QC)/QA program and Attachment 15 (Added) and
      Attachment 16 (Added) to determine technical and observation work area inspection
      requirements. As a minimum, QAEs will include a percentage of each technical
      inspection included in the contractor’s QC/QA program, and all applicable technical and
      observation work area inspection requirements in Attachment 15 (Added) and
      Attachment 16 (Added).
      18.1.3.3. (Added-AETC) Some aircraft are supported by partial CLS contracts such as
      the T-1, T-6 and T-38. The QAE surveilling these contracts will:
         18.1.3.3.1. (Added-AETC) Be thoroughly familiar with the CLS concept and the
         applicable CLS SOW.
         18.1.3.3.2. (Added-AETC) Review CLS contract amendments and airworthiness
         directives, service bulletins, safety communiqués, service information letters, and
         service instructions received for the weapons system. The system program director
         (SPD), in coordination with HQ AETC, determines the implementation of technical
         directives.
         18.1.3.3.3. (Added-AETC) Attempt to resolve technical problems at the lowest
         level possible. If problem resolution is beyond local capability or has contractual
         implications, elevate the problems through the applicable HQ AETC functional
         manager to the ACO for the contract. The FC and QAE are not empowered to make
         contractual decisions.
         18.1.3.3.4. (Added-AETC) Attend program management review and technical
         interchange meetings as scheduled by the ACO or SPD, if applicable.
  18.1.4. (Added-AETC) For partial CLS COMBS contracts, the FC and QAE will develop a
  tailored performance plan to meet the surveillance and documentation procedures for a
  partial CLS contract. Forward a copy of this plan to HQ AETC/A4MA. As a minimum, the
  QAE will:
      18.1.4.1. (Added-AETC) Submit a monthly verification of not mission capable-supply
      (NMCS) time to the ACO or SPD.
      18.1.4.2. (Added-AETC) Verify work requests and over and above actions submitted
      by the CLS contractor.
      18.1.4.3. (Added-AETC) Investigate cannot duplicate (CND) discrepancies reported by
      the COMBS manager.
      18.1.4.4. (Added-AETC) Perform periodic safety, environmental, and housekeeping
      inspections of the COMBS facility.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                411


       18.1.4.5. (Added-AETC) Review and monitor the contractor support equipment
       maintenance schedule.
       18.1.4.6. (Added-AETC) Monitor the depot maintenance schedule, if applicable, for
       aircraft and engines, paying particular attention to timely inputs.
18.1. (AETC) Government Contract Quality Assurance. This chapter establishes
procedures for surveilling aircraft and aircraft-related trainer maintenance contracts within
AETC. It applies to all AETC organizations responsible for surveilling aircraft, aircraft-related
(e.g., AGE, munitions, PMEL, etc.) and aircraft-related trainer maintenance contract activities
including aircraft supported by ―full‖ or ―partial‖ CLS activities.
18.2. Management of Government Property. See FAR Part 45. Air Force Equipment
Management System (AFEMS) and Information Processing Management System (IPMS) shall
be used to manage government property possessed by performance-based activities to the
maximum extent possible. AFEMS shall be used to manage Equipment Authorized Inventory
Data (EAID) accountable property only. Manage non-EAID accountable property IAW
procedures in the Performance Management Assessment Plan (PMAP). For the purposes of this
document, PMAP is referred to as Performance Plan (PP) to avoid confusion with Procurement
Management Assessment Program. Property management is a joint responsibility of the
performance-based activity, PCO/ACO, and government program management office.
18.3. Contract Administration. See FAR Part 42. The contracting officer, PCO or ACO is the
OPR for contract administration. The program management office is the Office of Collateral
Responsibility (OCR) for executing the contract administration tasks as determined by the
PCO/ACO.
   18.3.1. The PCO/ACO is the OPR for issuing contract modifications; making changes,
   correcting errors, executing options, adding new requirements, etc.    The program
   management office is the OCR for issuing and identifying the need for contract
   modifications. The Functional Commander / Functional Director (FC/FD) and the quality
   assurance personnel are the best sources for inputs on the need for making changes,
   correcting errors, executing options, adding new requirements, etc.
18.4. Contracting Officer. The PCO/ACO is responsible for overseeing the administration of a
contract and is the only individual with the legal authority to act as an agent between the
government and the contractor. This legal authority, provided under federal law, gives a
PCO/ACO the power to enter into, modify, interpret, and terminate a contract on behalf of the
government. The greatest responsibility of the PCO/ACO is to ensure the contractor's

   18.8.9. FC/FD contract surveillance related training. All FC/FD must successfully complete
   training within 30 days of assignment.
   18.8.9. (AETC) All FCs must successfully complete the Functional Commander’s
   Executive Training Session provided by HQ AETC/A4MMR within 90 days of assignment.
18.9. PP. The purpose of a PP is to provide a planned process for surveilling the
contractor's actual performance, and comparing that performance against the contractual
requirements to determine conformity with the technical requirements of the contract. The
PP shall identify and describe the roles and responsibilities for implementing and maintaining the
following key elements of managing and executing a contract performance management
assessment program: See Figure 18.1

vi. Performance Assessment Report Closure
   18.9.1. PP development. PP development is mandatory for all AF units that fall under the
   purview of this instruction. It is the responsibility of the FC/FD and Chief QAE to ensure
   that a PP effectively measures and evaluates a contractor. When properly developed the PP
   provides QAEs with information to identify acceptable performance and potential reasons for
   any nonconforming performance.
   18.9.1. (AETC) Ensure the performance plan is developed to effectively measure contractor
   performance according to applicable guidance/requirements (AFIs, TOs, SOW, PWS,
   contractor’s QA/QC plan, contractor’s proposal, locally directed inspections, and associated
   baselines, etc.).
   18.9.2. PP inspection elements. Items included in the applicable contract Section C
   requirements document are required PP inspection elements.
       18.9.2.1. Identify additional contract surveillance requirements in the PP.           PP
       surveillance will be based on the minimum surveillance necessary to assess effective and
       efficient contractor compliance to performance work statement requirements.
       Surveillance methods shall be based on performance-based contract assessment methods
       and techniques. The PP shall avoid using traditional legacy system methods such as
       stove-pipe checklists and constant inspection.
       18.9.2.2. Identify and describe performance-based contract assessment techniques and
       their application. The PP shall also describe how to document and report exceptional and
       unacceptable performance.
       18.9.2.3. Establish and assign responsibilities in the PP for verifying costs of
       reimbursable items, to include items purchased through the micro-purchase program,
       when applicable.
       18.9.2.4. Establish procedures to review, evaluate, and provide comments and
       recommendations to contractor proposals. These proposals are for contract modifications
       not for new contracts.
       18.9.2.5. Include procedures for development, and coordination of monthly surveillance
       schedules.
       18.9.2.6. Ensure contractor hours of operation are surveilled on a random basis to
       include all shifts, weekends, and holidays the contractor works.
       18.9.2.7. The scope of contract performance assessment or inspection shall be based on
       past performance, mandatory, statutory, and regulatory requirements. Performance
       assessment planning shall consider operational risk, service complexity, and criticality as
       factors in deciding the performance assessment plan from month to month.
       18.9.2.8. (Added-AETC) Clearly identify QAE responsibilities.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                  421


   18.9.3. PP format. The PP is developed IAW requirements of AFI 63-124, this instruction,
   and applicable MAJCOM guidance.
   18.9.3. (AETC) Submit initial and revised performance plans to HQ AETC/A4PM (HQ
   AETC/A4MA for CLS contracts) for approval prior to implementation. The performance
   plan is established and written as an OI.
18.10. Surveillance Scheduling. The QAE will develop a monthly schedule of surveillance
activities based on PP requirements. The schedule must be completed no later than five duty
days prior to the beginning of the period it covers. The FC/FD must review and return the
schedule to the QAE no later than the last day of the month preceding the scheduled month. The
chief QAE must provide a copy of the schedule to the PCO/ACO before the start of the
surveillance period. Post changes to scheduled observations as they occur and send copies to the
PCO/ACO and FC/FD as requested.
   18.10.1. If minimum monthly surveillance requirements cannot be met due to equipment
   nonavailability or special circumstances, an explanation on the summary for each missed
   area and/or inspection category is required. In such cases an approval statement from the
   FC/FD and PCO/ACO for the variance is required.
   18.10.2. The chief QAE shall adjust surveillance activities commensurate with contractor’s
   performance and level of risk to the government should the contractor not perform in an
   acceptable manner. If a particular function of the contractor’s performance has a continuing
   record of acceptable performance and unacceptable performance would not likely result in
   loss of life to AF personnel or damage to government property, surveillance of that function
   should be reduced. If contractor performance of a function is less than satisfactory,
   surveillance of that function should be increased. When this is determined to be appropriate,
   the chief QAE, with FC/FD and PCO/ACO approval, will adjust the surveillance schedule.
   18.10.2. (AETC) When a unit acquires a new weapon system it may be prudent to increase
   the minimum surveillance requirements during the transition. Also include an explanation of
   increased surveillance in the monthly summary when it is determined increased surveillance
   is warranted in a particular area/function.
       18.10.2.1. (Added-AETC) When it is determined surveillance is not required in an
       observation area based on a continuing record of acceptable performance by the
       contractor, the Chief QAE, with the approval of the FC and CO, will make a note in the
       monthly summary. Surveillance of an observation will not be skipped for more than one
       prescribed period (month, quarter, etc.). NOTE: This is not applicable to technical
       inspection requirements.
18.11. Inspections.
   18.11.1. Technical inspections. Technical requirements of a contract are surveilled by
   performing technical inspections. Any maintenance task accomplished in accordance with
   technical guidance, (TO, work-card, etc.) qualifies for QAE surveillance under the technical
   inspection concept. Inspections may be performed while maintenance is being performed
   (concurrently) or after the fact. QAEs surveilling contracts that do not have technical
   inspections specifically addressed in this instruction will use the procedures in this paragraph
   to perform technical inspections included in the PP. QAE accomplish technical inspections
   by evaluating the following:
422                          AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


      18.11.1.1. Checking a minimum of 50 percent of the required inspection items.
      Normally, disassemblies of a part, removal of a stress panel, or similar actions are not
      necessary to accomplish a technical inspection.
      18.11.1.1. (AETC) Ensure that when evaluating only a portion of the required
      inspection items that documentation includes specifically identifying/annotating those
      items that were evaluated.
      18.11.1.2. Review of the aircraft or equipment forms and the MIS for proper
      documentation (applicable to the job being surveilled); checking for proper and current
      technical data usage; proper tool usage; and after maintenance Foreign Object (FO)
      checks of the area in which the task was performed.
      18.11.1.3. Minimum technical inspection surveillance requirements/frequencies for
      applicable aircraft and trainer transient aircraft will be determined by each Lead
      MAJCOM. The FC/FD, PCO/ACO and chief QAE, using MAJCOM guidance will
      jointly determine any additional surveillance requirements associated with maintenance
      contracts.
      18.11.1.3. (AETC) Minimum technical area surveillance requirements and frequencies
      for aircraft and munitions are identified in Attachment 16 (Added). Minimum
      surveillance technical area inspection requirements and frequencies for training wings
      (TRW) are in Attachment 18 (Added). The ACO, Chief QAE and FC, using the contract
      as a guide, jointly determine any additional surveillance requirements.
         18.11.1.3.1. (AETC) Minimum technical area surveillance requirements for stand-
         alone transient maintenance activities are identified in Attachment 19 (Added). Stand-
         alone transient maintenance functions are defined as those contracts where the
         primary function is to perform transient maintenance services.
         18.11.1.3.2. (Added-AETC) QAEs surveilling stand-alone transient maintenance
         functions with additional maintenance requirements such as AGE/SE inspection and
         maintenance or fabrication responsibilities will review their contract requirements (to
         include the contractor’s QC/QA) and establish technical inspections as required. As a
         minimum, include an adequate percentage of each contractor QC/QA inspection
         requirements.
      18.11.1.4. QAE activities surveilling AF maintenance contracts not specifically
      addressed in this chapter will use the contract Section C requirements document to
      determine technical area surveillance requirements. As a minimum, include a percentage
      of each technical inspection in the contractor's Quality Check (QC) program requirements
      outlined in the contract Section C requirements document.
      18.11.1.5. Technical Inspection ratings. Technical inspections will be rated as either
      conforms or non-conforms. Assign non-conforms ratings when one of the following
      conditions occurs:
         18.11.1.5.1. A step serious enough to adversely affect the performance of the
         equipment involved is omitted or improperly completed.
         18.11.1.5.2. A major or Red X discrepancy is detected.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                              423


         18.11.1.5.2. (AETC) A major finding is defined as a condition that would endanger
         personnel, jeopardize equipment or system reliability, impact safety of flight or
         warrant discontinuing the process or equipment operation. Any Major discrepancy
         will result in an automatic inspection failure. NOTE: The inspector can/should
         declare a major finding when one additional action “would” result in one of the
         following; endanger personnel, jeopardize equipment or system reliability,
         impact safety of flight or warrant discontinuing the process or equipment
         operation.
         18.11.1.5.3. The performance threshold, if established, is not met.
         18.11.1.5.4. Assign a technical rating inspection as acceptable when the total number
         of minor discrepancies does not exceed the applicable baseline or AQL contained in
         the quality control/assurance requirements of the contract.
         18.11.1.5.4. (AETC) QAEs will use judgment and experience in determining minor
         discrepancies. A minor finding is defined as an unsatisfactory condition that requires
         repair or correction, but does not endanger personnel, impact safety of flight,
         jeopardize equipment reliability or warrant discontinuing a process or equipment
         operation. CAT II minors shall be documented for trends, but must not be counted
         against the AQL. NOTE: FO contained in tool kits or found in cargo areas of
         aircraft which pose no FOD threat are classified as a minor finding since it
         would require more than one additional action to meet the definition of a major
         finding. NOTE: Minor discrepancies that consist of a grouping of like
         deficiencies; for example, a panel may have three loose fasteners and they may
         be documented as one or three discrepancies. When grouping these types of
         deficiencies, ensure surveillance techniques are applied consistently across
         inspection areas.
         18.11.1.5.5. QAEs at units operating from a contract Section C requirements
         document with a Service Delivery Summary (SDS) will ensure that applicable
         standards identified in the SDS are considered during the development of technical
         inspection requirements.
  18.11.2. Follow-up technical inspections. Follow-up technical inspections are inspections
  accomplished that follow behind the contractor’s QC for the purpose of verifying the
  contractor’s quality program. All units, to include CLS contracts, will identify select
  technical inspections contained in their PP. The chief QAE schedules a sufficient percentage
  of technical inspections as follow-up technical inspections. These inspections may be
  performed in conjunction with other inspection requirements. If this option is used,
  document each inspection separately.
     18.11.2.1. As with technical inspections, follow-up technical inspections may also be
     performed concurrently or after contractor QC inspections. Include these requirements in
     the PP and the monthly surveillance schedule. Note: The chief QAE may elect to do QC
     follow-up inspection on observation work areas as well.
     18.11.2.2. Follow-up technical inspection ratings. Follow-up technical inspections will
     be rated the same as technical inspections.
424                          AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


  18.11.3. Observation area inspections. Observation area inspections are similar to IG
  inspections, where QAEs assess work center’s/areas ability to manage program areas they are
  contractually responsible for. Minimum observation work area surveillance requirements
  will be determined by each MAJCOM.
  18.11.3. (AETC) Minimum observation work area surveillance requirements for flying
  units are found in Attachment 17 (Added). Minimum requirements for TRWs are found in
  Attachment 20 (Added). Accomplish observation area inspections utilizing all checklists for
  each work center.
      18.11.3.1. (AETC) Minimum observation work area surveillance requirements for
      stand-alone transient maintenance contracts are found in Attachment 21 (Added). Stand-
      alone transient maintenance functions are defined as those contracts where the primary
      function will perform transient maintenance services. QAEs surveilling stand-alone
      transient maintenance functions with additional maintenance requirements such as
      AGE/SE inspection and maintenance, or fabrication responsibilities, etc., will review
      their contract requirements (to include the contractor’s QC/QA) and establish any
      additional observation work area inspections that may be required.
      18.11.3.2. (AETC) QAE activities surveilling AETC maintenance contracts not
      specifically addressed in this section will use Attachment 17 (Added) and Attachment 20
      (Added) as guides (when applicable) and the SOW to identify observation work area
      surveillance requirements. If observation requirements are not listed in Attachment 17
      (Added) and Attachment 20 (Added), use the SOW to determine the surveillance
      requirements that apply to a specific contract.
      18.11.3.3. (Added-AETC) Surveil observation work areas by performing inspections
      within each work area and assigning an overall rating, or perform inspections on each
      program within each work area, assign a rating to each program and assign an overall
      work area rating based on the ratings assigned to each program inspected. Characterize
      each program and/or work area as either conforms or nonconforms.
         18.11.3.3.1. (Added-AETC) If observation work areas are evaluated by performing
         inspections within each work area and assigning an overall rating, characterize a work
         area as conforms if no major discrepancies are identified or the number of minor
         discrepancies is less than 7. The chief QAE, with approval of the FC, may consider it
         appropriate to adjust the baseline or AQL up or down based on the size of the
         observation work area or because functions have been combined. If adjustments are
         made, they must be reflected in the performance plan and maintain documentation to
         support baseline or AQL adjustments.
         18.11.3.3.2. (Added-AETC) If observation work areas are evaluated by performing
         inspections of individual programs, assign a rating to each program in the work area.
         The chief QAE, with approval of the FC, will establish minor discrepancy baselines
         or AQLs for each program evaluated and maintain documentation to support the
         baselines or AQLs. Characterize each program as conforms if minor discrepancy
         baselines or AQLs were not exceeded or no major discrepancies were identified.
         Assign an overall work area rating based on the ratings of each program. A program
         characterized as nonconforms does not necessarily make the entire work area
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                               425


        unacceptable. An example report of inspection results is provided in table 18.1
        (Added) of this instruction.
     18.11.3.4. (Added-AETC) QAEs use judgment and experience to determine major
     and/or minor discrepancies. Categorize major/minor discrepancies as follows:
        18.11.3.4.1. (Added-AETC) A major finding is defined as a condition that would
        endanger personnel, jeopardize equipment or system reliability, impact safety of
        flight or warrant discontinuing the process or equipment operation. Any Major
        discrepancy will result in an automatic inspection failure. NOTE: The inspector
        can/should declare a major finding when one additional action “would” result in
        one of the following; endanger personnel, jeopardize equipment or system
        reliability, impact safety of flight or warrant discontinuing the process or
        equipment operation.
        18.11.3.4.2. (Added-AETC) A minor finding is defined as an unsatisfactory
        condition that requires repair or correction, but does not endanger personnel, impact
        safety of flight, jeopardize equipment reliability or warrant discontinuing a process or
        equipment operation. CAT II minors shall be documented for trends, but must not be
        counted against the AQL. NOTE: FO contained in tool kits or found in cargo
        areas of aircraft which pose no FOD threat are classified as a minor finding
        since it would require more than one additional action to meet the definition of a
        major finding. NOTE: Minor discrepancies that consist of a grouping of like
        deficiencies. (e.g., bench stock with 6 commingled bins, 10 bins not flagged, and 4
        bins with torn labels may be documented as one or three discrepancies against
        the observation guide.) When grouping these types of deficiencies, ensure
        surveillance techniques are applied consistently across inspection areas.
     18.11.3.5. (Added-AETC) QAEs will develop a separate evaluation guide for each
     observation area. The chief QAE will review evaluation guides annually and document
     the review on an official memorandum or locally approved form, and file it in the QAE
     office. Evaluation guides may be included as part of the performance plan.
        18.11.3.5.1. (Added-AETC) Use evaluation guides for the inspection of a particular
        area. (Note: Area inspections are not limited to the evaluation guide content.)
        Annotate evaluation guides with the following statement: ―Area inspection is not
        limited to the content of evaluation guide.‖
        18.11.3.5.2. (Added-AETC) If functions have been combined within an
        organization, develop a single evaluation guide that encompasses the combined
        functions. Combined functions normally share common elements such as CTK, TOs,
        etc. Functions collocated in the same facility are not considered combined. The chief
        QAE will determine if an increase to the inspection baseline for minor discrepancies
        is appropriate.
     18.11.3.6. (Added-AETC) Supply. If applicable, QAEs will sample supply and Air
     Force Repair Enhancement Program (AFREP) management products/aids quarterly
     during applicable observation work area inspections for signs of fraud, waste, abuse, or
     poor supply discipline. Products may include the Daily Document Register (D04), Due-
     Out Validation (M30), Repair Cycle Asset Management List (D23), Readiness Based
426                            AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


      Leveling Misallocated List (R49), Priority Monitor Report (D18), AWP Validation List
      (D19), Special Level Review List (R35), Bench Stock Review (M04), Organization
      Bench Stock Listing (S04), Supply Point Listing (Q13), and micro-purchase summaries.
      18.11.3.7. (Added-AETC) Environmental Plans and Programs. Establish an
      observation work area guide to effectively monitor the contractor’s compliance with
      federal, state and local laws as well as DoD, Air Force, and AETC directives, and the
      installation’s applicable environmental plans and programs. Ensure hazardous waste
      collection points and storage areas that are the contractor’s responsibilities are included in
      surveillance requirements as applicable. Note: QAEs are not professional environmental
      inspectors; they surveil to ensure compliance with contract requirements. If required,
      QAEs will seek assistance from the base environmental function through the CO.
      18.11.3.8. (Added-AETC) Contractor Training. Include surveillance requirements in
      the performance plan to effectively monitor compliance with the contractor’s training
      plan as prescribed by the contract. QAEs will place special emphasis on the adequacy of
      the training provided by the contractor and perform the following:
         18.11.3.8.1. (Added-AETC) Random monthly observance of task qualification, and
         certification training accomplished by the contractor, to include training associated
         with special certification tasks.
         18.11.3.8.2. (Added-AETC) Random              quarterly    observance      of    recurring
         maintenance-training requirements.
         18.11.3.8.3. (Added-AETC) In addition to actually observing the training as it takes
         place, review training documentation, individual training records, and plans of
         instruction, if applicable.
         18.11.3.8.4. (Added-AETC) Assign a conforms or nonconforms rating to contractor
         training observations based on whether or not the training observed meets contract
         requirements, the standards and intent of the contractor’s training plan, and the
         objectives of the training being provided.
      18.11.3.9. (Added-AETC) Work Area Inspection Critical Items. Each work area
      inspection will include the following critical items, as applicable:
         18.11.3.9.1. (Added-AETC) Tool and equipment management, FO prevention, and
         housekeeping procedures. Ensure all applicable areas and facilities are included, such
         as flight line, hangar, maintenance facilities, and jet engine operating areas.
         18.11.3.9.2. (Added-AETC) Supply procedures, TO maintenance, forms and MIS
         documentation, PMEL Automated Management System (PAMS), automated oil
         analysis, and any other automated system that includes aircraft or equipment
         information.
         18.11.3.9.3. (Added-AETC) Physical security, conservation of utilities, fire
         prevention, environmental protection, and facilities management.
      18.11.3.10. (Added-AETC) General Guides. Chief QAEs will develop a general guide
      to identify minimum requirements. General guides are used with the applicable
      observation work area evaluation guide for the inspected work area. Evaluation guides
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                                                                         427


      should contain minimum inspection areas or items and should not include overwhelming
      requirements that may cause an over inspection of a particular area.
      18.11.3.11. (Added-AETC) Evaluation Guides. QAEs surveilling contracts with an
      SDS must ensure observation area evaluation guides are developed, considering the
      performance thresholds in the SDS, and the minimum requirements identified in this
      supplement. Also, review Attachment 19 (Added) and Attachment 20 (Added) for
      possible addition of observation areas to the surveillance program.
      18.11.3.12. (Added-AETC) Contractor QC Evaluations. All units, to include CLS, are
      encouraged to perform follow-up inspections on contractor QC inspections of observation
      work areas. These inspections may be follow-up or concurrent with QC inspections, and
      they may be performed in conjunction with other inspection requirements. When
      performed in conjunction with other inspection requirements, document each inspection
      independently. Include these requirements in the performance plan, and the monthly
      surveillance schedule.
      18.11.3.13. (Added-AETC) Munitions. Evaluation guides for munitions activities will
      be developed utilizing the AETC Management and Maintenance of Munitions inspection
      checklist and the applicable PWS/SOW. Refer to Attachment 21 (Added) for the
      minimum essential critical items that must be included in the munitions surveillance
      guides.

   18.11.4. Safety. Document violations of Occupational Safety and Health Administration
   (OSHA) or Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Standards (AFOSHSTDs) that clearly
   present a potential to damage or injure government resources as part of the inspection being
   performed or, if appropriate, "as observed." The documentation should clearly indicate the
   potential to damage or injure government resources. QAEs do not document violations of
 428                             AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


   OSHA or AFOSHSTDs that do not present the potential to damage or injure government
   resources; rather they will informally notify the site supervisor and PCO/ACO.
   18.11.5. Documentation File Inspections. Rate documentation file inspections for aircraft,
   support equipment, and engines. The inspections include review of the status and historical
   documents (include documents in the MIS). Send discrepancies found in the historical
   documents file to the contractor for corrective action. Actual discrepancies are not corrected
   except for items of a historical nature, including automated documents that can be verified
   from other sources. Specifically:
       18.11.5.1. Each incorrect clearing of a Red X symbol, erasures of symbols, overdue
       Time Change Items (TCIs), and overdue inspections caused by improper documentation
       are considered major discrepancies. The correct use and clearance of Red X symbols are
       items of special attention during documentation file inspections. QAEs must ensure
       unsafe or unfit for operation conditions are represented by Red X entries and these entries
       are properly cleared.
       18.11.5.2. (Added-AETC) Do not charge documentation errors against the contractor
       for form entries initiated at other than the home station or if generated by non
       maintenance personnel. Correct deficiencies only if they affect historical and (or)
       automated information.
       18.11.5.3. (Added-AETC) A major discrepancy or more than three minor discrepancies
       for each ten pages (e.g., 1 to 10 pages, three minors; 11 to 20, six minors). The chief
       QAE may lower the baseline for minor discrepancies on support equipment if
       appropriate.
18.12. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Pilot Responsibilities. FCF pilots assigned to the QAE
activity may assist the FC/FD and chief QAE as necessary. Additionally, FCF pilots after
completing QAE training requirements may perform no-notice installed engine operation
inspections and training IAW AFI 21-101. FCF pilots will inform the chief QAE of problems or
adverse trends in contractor performance Noted when performing FCFs.
18.12. (AETC) Functional Check Flight (FCF) Pilot Responsibilities. FCF pilot QAE
training requirements consists of Phase 1 and Phase II accomplished at the unit. FCF pilots
performing QAE duties may assist the FC and chief QAE as necessary. Report FCF pilot
surveillance directly to the chief QAE.
18.13. Documenting/correcting contractor performance. QAE technical, observation area, or
as observed inspections will be documented using applicable AF IMTs/forms or electronic
equivalent. Document any discrepancies as soon as they are discovered, and notify the
contractor as soon as the surveillance is completed. After the surveillance form is completed,
QAEs must also request a contractor representative to initial the document on which the
inspection is recorded to acknowledge receipt of performance assessment results and not
necessarily concurrence with the findings. If the contractor representative refuses to initial, it is
so Noted by the QAE. A date and time the discrepancy is discovered is also annotated, and the
contract representative is asked to correct the problem. Document and bring to the attention of
the contractor errors found in services not scheduled for observation, but do not use unscheduled
or as observed inspections to determine performance acceptability for the contractors monthly
rating.
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012                                                   429


18.13. (AETC) Documenting/correcting contractor performance. Use AETC Form 447,
Routing and Review of QAE Reports, a form specifically prescribed by the contract, a locally
approved form, or an official memorandum to document discrepancies.
18.14. End of month surveillance summary. At the end of each month the chief QAE
compiles a monthly summary of all QAE surveillance activities for the month. The content,
format and routing of the end of month surveillance summary will be determined by each
MAJCOM.
18.14. (AETC) End of month surveillance summary. Units surveilling aircraft and aircraft
related trainer maintenance contracts will develop a monthly summary of QAE surveillance
activities and, for those contracts AETC has program oversight, provide a copy to HQ
AETC/A4PM (HQ AETC/A4MA for CLS contracts) NLT the 15th workday of the month.
Include FCF pilot surveillance inspections. Send a copy of the summary to the ACO, FC, and 2
AF/TTOC-O workflow or as applicable. Maintain copies of all summaries on file for the life of
the contract. Compute individual inspections, technical area, observation area and overall results
as follows: Total number of inspections rated conforms, divided by the total number of
inspections, multiplied by 100 percent.
18.15. Contractor non-conformance. If at any time during the surveillance rating period
(typically monthly or quarterly as specified by the contract Section C requirements document),
the results of surveillance required by the PP show that the number of unacceptable observations
do not meet contract standards or performance requirements, and the chief QAE determines it is
not government caused, the QAE organization initiates a corrective action request specified by
the applicable contract or a form specified by the MAJCOM.
   18.15.1. Forward the completed report to the PCO/ACO for evaluation. If the PCO/ACO
   determines it is appropriate, send the report to the contractor, with return receipt requested.
   The contractor normally has 15 calendar days from date of receipt to return the report to the
   PCO/ACO with a response as to cause, corrective action, and actions taken to prevent
   recurrence. The PCO/ACO, in consultation with the QAE, evaluates the contractor's
   response and takes appropriate action.
   18.15.1. (AETC) Forward all surveillance documentation/reviews to the ACO for review
   within 15 workdays after the end of each month.
   18.15.2. If the contractor’s actions cited by the contractor in their response to the report fail
   to correct the area of non-conformance, the chief QAE ensures another corrective action
   request is initiated for any subsequent surveillance rating periods in the same non-
   conforming area.
   18.15.3. If any areas of non-conformance are not corrected using previous guidance, it is the
   responsibility of the FC/FD to contact the PCO/ACO or government program office to
   initiate discussion with corporate headquarters or issue a cure notice. In extreme
   circumstances a show cause notice or a contract termination notice may be required as
   determined by the FC/FD and PCO.
18.15. (AETC) Contractor non-conformance. If the results of surveillance show the number
of nonconforming observations do not meet contract standards or performance requirements, the
QAE will initiate a corrective action request using a form specified by the applicable contract or
a locally approved form or memorandum. QAEs will also document government caused
 430                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_VANCEAFBSUP_I 6 AUGUST 2012


deviations that result in contractor’s failure to meet contract requirements. Use a locally
approved form or an official memorandum to document customer complaints.
18.16. Past Performance Reporting. QAE organizations in coordination with the FC/FD and
PCO/ACO will accomplish annual contractor performance reporting using the Contractor
Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) as identified in the June 2007 AF CPARS
guide. For more information: http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/cparsfiles/cpars/refmatl.htm
18.17. Acceptance of services will be accomplished utilizing DD Form 250 or the Wide
Area Work Flow system (WAWF). It is the chief QAE’s responsibility to validate the
accuracy of financial figures submitted by the contractor prior to the government paying for
services.
18.18. Award fee administration. Award fee management procedures will be determined by
the applicable contract award fee evaluation plan or MAJCOM determined procedures.
18.19. Transition administration (FAR Part 49). During the transition period of a contract,
the QAE organization is responsible to ensure the contractor meets all criteria outlined in the
contractor proposed transition plan.

1.2. Contact the applicable maintenance supervision to review requirements and request support
from the responsible units to assemble an MRT.
1.3. Brief MRT personnel concerning their duties and responsibilities. Ensure the MRT chief
understands the responsibilities Emphasize the following:
1.3.1. The MRT is required to call the home station MOC upon arrival to provide a phone
number where they can be contacted.
1.3.2. The MRT is responsible for their equipment and parts:
1.3.2.1. Verify necessary parts are available. Open each container to ensure the right
part(s) are in the box prior to departure.
1.3.2.2. Check special tools, support and test equipment for serviceability prior to departure.
1.4. Ensure TDY orders are generated for MRT. Consider the following authorizations and
provide as required:
1.4.1. Mission Route Support (MRS) or Mission Essential Personnel (MEP).
1.4.1.1. MRS permits the bumping of cargo to allow space for the MRT and their equipment.
1.4.2. Advance per diem.
1.4.3. Commercial travel.
1.4.4. Rental car.
1.4.5. Variations:
1.5. Direct the responsible shop to order the required parts and the applicable unit to select the
required equipment items. If requirements are not known, make contact with the AC/flight
engineer/ crew chief to determine what items are required.
1.5.1. Items too large or heavy to be carried will be coordinated with Lead Command and
processed by the responsible shop and given to the TMF for shipment.
1.5.2. If parts cannot be sourced locally, consider directing cannibalization.
1.6. Commercial transportation of a MRT and equipment is, in many cases, the most expeditious
method. Consider the following:
1.6.1. Airline:
1.6.2. Surface (bus, rail, and limousine).
1.6.3. Air Express Small Package Service.

1.7.2. Selected mode of transportation and itinerary.
1.7.3. Names for MRT personnel and nomenclature of equipment items and parts.
1.7.4. Authorization for excess baggage allowance if necessary.
1.7.4. Record TCNs, government bills of lading (GBL), and any applicable billing or shipment
numbers.
Note: Shipment of large or heavy items by commercial airline mandates prior coordination with
airline personnel by MOC or the MRT. To maintain control of parts/equipment, they must be
hand-carried or checked as baggage. If an item is not accepted as carry-on luggage or checked as
baggage, purchase of an extra seat to accommodate it must be considered and is recommended.
Advance coordination with the airline is the key to a successful movement without unnecessary
delays.
1.8. Maintain contact with the MRT or the unit responsible for the parts/equipment shipment to
ensure that all resources arrive in time to make the scheduled departure.

      T-6, T-38, T-1 AND MUNITIONS TECHNICAL INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

A16.1. (Added-AETC) MDS and Munitions Inspection Requirements. Table A16.1 lists
the minimum MDS and munitions technical inspection requirements. Inspections and evaluations
in the areas and quantities listed are monthly requirements unless otherwise noted. When
computing frequency, round off requirements to the next whole number. Inspection requirements
apply to each MDS assigned. Schedule quarterly surveillance requirements on a random yet
adequately distributed basis. For example, an inspection completed in the last week of a quarter
should not be scheduled for inspection again during the first week of the new quarter.

Notes:
1. Perform a separate technical inspection of active forms and documents (to include the MIS) in
conjunction with all aircraft, engine, and support equipment inspections (this includes each PE
and PH inspection). Documentation errors not directly related to the equipment technical
inspection will be documented as ―as observed‖.
2. Number of required inspections is based on percentage of aircraft possessed, or percentage of
inspections scheduled monthly, whichever is less. Any combination of pre-flight, BPO, and thru-
flight, etc., selected to meet the monthly inspection requirement may be used. Example: If 55
aircraft are in unit’s possession, 4 inspections are required. One pre-flight, one thru-flight, and
two basic post-flight inspections would meet the minimum requirement of four inspections. (Do
not include aircraft in storage or at forward operating locations in computations for inspection
requirements to be performed at home station.)
3. Number of required inspections is based on percentage of aircraft possessed or percentage of
inspections, washes, TCTOs, etc., scheduled monthly, whichever is less. For T-6, T-38 and T-1
aircraft, the sum of all areas equals one aircraft.
4. Units with less than 12 equipment items assigned may distribute inspections as appropriate,
providing each item is inspected at least once during the calendar year.
5. Number of required inspections is based on a percentage of inspections scheduled for the
month.
6. Number of required inspections is based on the monthly average number of engines processed
through the propulsion repair facility during the previous 6 months. It consists of technical
requirements that can be inspected without disassembly of the engine.
7. Number of required inspections is based on total number of inspections required for assigned
support equipment, regardless of MDS. Provide equitable inspection distribution between
equipment assigned to different aircraft MDSs.
8. Inspect TMDE for adequacy of user inspections, repairs, serviceability, calibrations, and
corrosion control.
9. Review certification/recertification documentation, verify they are not outdated and current
munitions requirements are listed.
10. Areas include flight line, maintenance hangars, AGE yard, etc. QAEs should ensure all areas
are looked at on a random basis.

11. Number of required inspections is based on the percentage of displays possessed or
percentage of inspections, washes, etc., scheduled monthly, whichever is less. Each display must
be inspected at least once every 2 years.
12. Check fire and chemical hazard signs are properly posted and timely notification of
appropriate agencies, e.g. fire department, and security forces.
13. Check for proper storage and correct documentation on applicable AFTO Forms 102,
movement sheets, and 1500 series condition code tags. (AFTO Form 102 is prescribed by AFI
21-201. Refer to this publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
14. Make sure munitions inspectors are properly appointed and recertified.
15. Ensure proper documents are enclosed and shipments have correct transportation control
numbers.
16. Verify proper containers markings using TO 11A-1-10 and the item TO.
17. Ensure the item is same as described on the issue document, and if applicable, TO 11A-1-53,
General Instructions for Ammunitions Color Coding, Identification of Empty and Inert Loaded
Ammunition Items and Components, and Assignment of Version Numbers to Training and
Dummy Ammunition Items, inspections were accomplished.

            FLYING UNIT OBSERVATION WORK AREA REQUIREMENTS

A17.1. (Added-AETC) Work Area Requirements. Schedule periodic surveillance
requirements on a random yet adequately distributed basis. See Table A17.1 for the required
surveillance areas and frequencies. For example, an inspection completed in the last week of a
quarter should not be scheduled for inspection again during the first week of the new quarter.
Note: All flying unit observation work area requirements may not apply to smaller flying units,
i.e., rotary wing aircraft. Smaller flying units will determine and surveil those areas that apply.

contractor, whichever is less. Note: If the number of inspections is zero, then the number of
required inspections will be based on the percentage of trainers possessed and maintained by the
contractor.
3. Number of required inspections is based on total number of inspections regardless of MDS.
Provide equitable inspection distribution. As a minimum, one of each MDS must be inspected at
least once each 6 months.
4. Inspect TMDE for adequacy of user inspections, repairs, serviceability, calibration, and
corrosion control.
5. Number of required inspections is based on the percentage of displays possessed or percentage
of inspections, washes, etc., scheduled monthly, whichever is less. Inspect each display at least
every 2 years.
6. Inspect document file for each item of equipment (if maintained) as a minimum, once each
year.
7. Inspection frequency is determined locally. Consider the size of the TO file and or work center
(for FO inspections) when establishing inspection baselines or AQLs.
8. Not applicable to 37 OSS.
9. 37 OSS performs 2 powered /2 nonpowered.

      TRANSIENT MAINTENANCE TECHNICAL INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

A19.1. (Added-AETC) Inspection Requirements. Table A19.1 lists the minimum monthly
requirements for transient maintenance functions (contracts where the primary function is
transient maintenance). QAEs surveilling transient maintenance functions with additional
maintenance requirements such as AGE/SE inspection and maintenance or fabrication
responsibilities will review their contract requirements (to include the contractor’s QC/QA), and
establish technical inspections as required. Inspections and evaluations in the areas and quantities
listed below are monthly requirements unless otherwise noted. Schedule surveillance
requirements on a random yet adequately distributed basis.

Notes:
1. Perform an inspection of active forms and documents (to include the MIS) in conjunction with
aircraft, AGE and support equipment maintenance actions and inspections.
2. Number of required inspections is based on documentation of transient aircraft forms and
assigned equipment that transient maintenance is responsible for (if applicable). Documentation
inspections will include applicable MIS entries.
3. Areas include flight line, maintenance hangars, AGE yards, etc., for which the contractor is
responsible or performs maintenance. QAEs will ensure all areas are looked at on a random
basis. Perform these inspections within a reasonable time after the contractor has completed the
FO inspection.
4. Percentages should be based on annual historical data.
