                                               Chapter 2

                                    COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The AFSOC command and control (C2) system is based on the principles of centralized
monitoring and decentralized control and execution. The result is a C2 mechanism which keeps the
AFSOC Commander informed of the current status of AFSOC forces while enabling the wing or group
commander to exercise control over day to day operations unless operational control is changed
(CHOPed) to another operational commander.

2.2. Operational Control (OPCON). AFSOC is designated as the controlling agency for USSOCOM
assigned Air Force aircraft, while theater special operations commands (SOC) have OPCON of the-
ater-based assets. In practice, responsibility for planning and executing AFSOC missions is routinely del-
egated to the wing or group commander. The wing or group commander, in turn, exercises control of
non-close-hold missions through the command post. In the event that assigned forces undergo a change
in operational control (CHOP), responsibility for mission monitoring passes from the wing or group C2
facility to the gaining command. Changeover will be accomplished IAW the pertinent OPLAN, OPORD,
or deployment or execution order.

NOTE:
For certain close-hold activities, security considerations may compel the wing or group commander to
shift mission monitoring responsibilities from the command post to another wing agency. The wing or
group commander will ensure procedures are established for the responsible agency to monitor mission
progress and advise the AFSOC/DO and CC as appropriate.

2.3. Mission Monitoring. Except for selected close-hold missions, the Command Center monitors air-
craft, which move to, from, or between off-station locations. The Command Center tracks off-station air-
craft via the command and control system and direct reporting from aircrew. The following mission
monitoring procedures primarily apply to missions that are not close-hold in nature and have not been
CHOPed to another command.
   2.3.1. The mission commander, or if none is assigned, aircraft commander is responsible for flight
   reporting. Aircraft movement will be reported by SATCOM, INMARSAT, HF or land line to the
   appropriate controlling agency(ies). Normally make the report at the beginning and end of each flight
   leg. Include all takeoff and landing times, flight duration, maintenance status, and point of contact for
   the aircraft or mission commander as applicable.

2.4. Mission Commander. The unit commander will designate a mission commander when the aircraft
or crew is deployed away from home station for training, exercises, or other operations. The mission
commander should be a field grade officer. The mission commander or air mission commander will not
be a primary crewmember for exercises, but may fly as a crewmember when mission commander duties
do not adversely affect crew rest. Mission commander duties include, but are not limited to:
   2.4.1. Briefing crews on local operating procedures.
   2.4.2. Coordinating with ATC, range control, passengers, and others that may impact the mission.

     2.4.3. Ensuring personnel have ample and adequate billeting, messing, and transportation arrange-
     ments.
     2.4.4. Ensuring maintenance personnel know of aircraft and fuel requirements.
     2.4.5. Submitting timely reports on aircraft movements (see paragraph 2.3.1.).

2.5. Aircraft Commander Responsibility and Authority. The AFSOC Form 41, Flight Authoriza-
tion, designates an aircraft commander for all flights. Aircraft commanders are:
     2.5.1. In command of all persons on board the aircraft.
     2.5.2. Responsible for the welfare of their crew, passengers and the safe accomplishment of the mis-
     sion.
     2.5.3. Vested with the authority necessary to manage their crew and safely accomplish the mission.
     2.5.4. The final mission authority and will make decisions not specifically assigned to a higher
     authority.
     2.5.5. The final authority for accepting a waiver affecting their crew or mission.
     2.5.6. Charged with keeping the applicable commander and/or DV Code informed of mission
     progress and difficulties.
     2.5.7. Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements in the absence of a mission com-
     mander (see paragraph 2.4.3.).
     2.5.8. The aircraft commander is the focal point for interaction between the aircrew and mission sup-
     port personnel. The controlling agency is the focal point for all required mission support activities.
     The aircraft commander will establish a point of contact with the controlling agency prior to entering
     crew rest.

2.6. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay a mission may be made either by the
agency with OPCON or the aircraft commander when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to
start or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the aircraft
commander. If the aircraft commander refuses a mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been
corrected or improved so that the mission can operate safely. Another aircraft commander and aircrew
will not be alerted to take the same mission under the same conditions.
     2.6.1. Diverting or rerouting a mission must be authorized by the commander with OPCON, except in
     an emergency or when required by en route or terminal weather conditions or facilities. In the event
     of an emergency or weather-related divert or reroute, the mission or aircraft commander must notify
     the controlling authority as soon as possible.
        2.6.1.1. The controlling agency directing the rerouting or diversion is responsible for ensuring
        destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft.
        2.6.1.2. The aircraft commander will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew lim-
        itations that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.
     2.6.2. When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the controlling agency will ensure the aircraft
     commander is provided existing and forecasted weather for the alternate. If the planned alternate is
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                      13

  unsuitable upon arrival at destination, the controlling agency will advise the aircraft commander of
  other suitable alternates.

                            CREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Qualification. Each person assigned as a primary crewmember must be qualified or in
training for qualification in that crew position, mission, and type aircraft.
     3.1.1. Basic aircraft qualification (BAQ) crewmembers may perform primary crew duties on any
     non-mission sortie and on missions when receiving mission qualification training or evaluations under
     the supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner in their respective crew position.
     3.1.2. Mission ready (MR) crewmembers may perform primary crew duties on any mission or
     non-mission sortie.
     3.1.3. Basic mission capable (BMC) crewmembers may perform primary duties on any unilateral
     training mission. For other missions, the unit commander must determine the readiness of each BMC
     crewmember to perform primary crew duties.
     3.1.4. Noncurrent (NC) or unqualified (UNQ) pilots may perform crew duties only on designated
     training or evaluation missions under the supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner pilot.
     Both pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI 11-401. Pilots noncurrent in an overseas
     sortie can fly under the supervision of another pilot current in overseas event.
     3.1.5. Other NC or UNQ crewmembers may perform duties in their primary crew position on any
     mission when under direct supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner in their respective
     crew position. In this case, the student crewmember and the instructor or flight examiner fulfills the
     requirement for one primary position as specified in Figure 3.1.

3.2. Crew Complement. Minimum crew complement is as specified in Figure 3.1. If resources permit,
commanders may add crewmembers to enhance mission accomplishment or maximize training. The
wing or group commander, or COMAFSOF, is the waiver authority for all other crew positions less than
the minimum specified by the Figure 3.1. and for modifying the minimum crew compliment.

3.3. Additional Crewmembers (ACM). An ACM is one assigned in addition to the normal aircrew
complement required for a mission. ACM status granted under this paragraph is applicable only to
AFSOC aircraft.
     3.3.1. Policy Governing ACM Authorization. Unit commanders may authorize ACM status to per-
     sonnel assigned or attached to the unit. ACM status will not be granted to personnel while on leave.
     Unit commanders have approval authority for personnel traveling on ACM orders to fly on aircraft
     under their control.
     3.3.2. Orders. ACM travel authority must be cited on the orders and include the crew position for
     which the individual is qualified. Travel orders that do not cite ACM authorization must be accom-
     panied by written authorization (letter or message).
     3.3.3. Logging of Flying Time. Flight examiners, flight surgeons, and medical technicians log flying
     time IAW AFI 11-401, Flight Management. Other ACMs may log flying time only at the discretion
     of the aircraft commander.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                           15

   3.3.4. Briefings. The aircraft commander or representative will brief all ACMs on emergency proce-
   dures and egress.
   3.3.5. Security Clearance. ACMs will possess a security clearance and will be briefed appropriately
   to the mission being performed.

3.4. Interfly. Wing or group commander, or COMAFSOF, is the approval authority for interfly on
AFSOC aircraft under their control. In all cases, the crew will be qualified in the aircraft.

3.5. Scheduling Restrictions. In addition to guidance in AFI 11-202 Volume 3 Chapter 9, comply with
the following restrictions. Crewmembers will not be scheduled to fly nor will they perform crew duties:
   3.5.1. When the maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules,
   will be exceeded.
   3.5.2. After consuming alcoholic beverages within l0 hours of show time or 12 hours of departure
   time, whichever is earliest, after consuming alcoholic beverages within 12 hours of assuming alert
   duty; or when under the influence of alcohol.
   3.5.3. Within 24 hours after being administered anesthetics for dental or surgical procedures. Flight
   surgeons may authorize shorter periods of not less than 8 hours.
   3.5.4. When taking oral or injected medication comply with the restrictions in AFI 48-123, Medical
   Examination and Standards.
   3.5.5. Aircrew members who have been exposed to aircraft ground pressurization checks exceeding
   10 minutes will not fly within 24 hours. Aircrew members who accomplish aircraft pressurization
   checks of less than 10 minutes duration will be restricted from flying for 30 minutes.

3.6. Crew Rest. In addition to AFI 11-202 Volume 3 Chapter 9, comply with the following guidance.
   3.6.1. Do not give crewmembers less than 12 hours crew rest without wing or group commander or
   COMAFSOF approval. Under unusual circumstances, it is permissible for crewmembers not previ-
   ously placed in crew rest to fly if they say they are sufficiently rested.
   3.6.2. Crewmembers departing on missions scheduled to recover away from home station should be
   notified 24 hours before reporting for the mission. The first 12 hours are not considered crew rest, but
   are designed to allow crewmembers to resolve personal affairs. During these first 12 hours, a crew-
   member may perform limited nonflying duties. The second 12-hour period is inviolate. For
   short-notice mission tasking or when a scheduled crewmember is unable to fly, crewmembers may be
   given less than 24 hours notification with unit DO approval; however, they will not be given less than
   12 hours. For all other missions, crewmembers will enter crew rest 12 hours before reporting for the
   mission.
   3.6.3. Alert crews will be given 12 hours crew rest prior to the earliest anticipated show time.
   3.6.4. Normal ground time at enroute stations should be planned for at least 16 hours between sched-
   uled landing and departure time.
   3.6.5. If the aircraft is not capable of being airborne within 4 hours of scheduled departure time, the
   aircrew may be returned to crew rest or released from the flight. Two hours minimum for aircraft pre-
   flight and stations time within the 4 hours should be provided. The unit commander/DO may grant
16                                                                     AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

     exceptions at the request of the aircraft commander. This paragraph applies to all missions, including
     unit training missions.
     3.6.6. The maintenance personnel are responsible to the aircraft commander. The aircraft com-
     mander and maintenance supervisor will determine how long the maintenance personnel can safely
     perform aircraft recovery actions. The maintenance personnel must have the opportunity to sleep 8
     hours of each 24-hour period.
     3.6.7. Postmission crew rest begins upon the final return of an individual to home station (not appli-
     cable to continuing missions) and runs continuously until completed. Postmission crew rest must be
     completed before starting the predeparture crew rest period for a subsequent mission. Do not require
     a crewmember to get immunizations, engage in ground training, perform alert or squadron duties, or
     perform any other activity, which would encroach upon crew rest. Waiver authority for postmission
     crew rest is the wing or group commander, or COMAFSOF. Waiver requests for postmission crew
     rest are considered on a case by case basis only with the concurrence of the individual crewmember.
     Compute post-TDY crew rest at the rate of 1 hour off for every 3 hours of TDY not to exceed 72
     hours.
        3.6.7.1. For missions less than 16 hours CDT, the unit commander determines post mission crew
        rest time.

3.7. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT begins at show time. When crewmembers perform other duties
prior to flight-related duties, CDT begins when reporting for the other duties. CDT ends when all crew-
members have completed postmission duties to include refueling, offloading, maintenance, etc. CDT
will not exceed the crew duty day (CDD) limitations below:
     3.7.1. The basic CDD is 16 hours provided no pilot proficiency training, or functional check flights
     (FCF) are accomplished after 12 hours and no inflight refueling events (IFR) after 14 hours. If the
     autopilot is not operational or its use is denied for more than 4 hours, the CDD will be 12 hours (the
     use of altitude hold does not constitute use of an autopilot). If the autopilot fails after departure, con-
     tinue to the next scheduled stop and then comply with the basic CDD limitations.
     3.7.2. The augmented CDD is 24 hours provided no pilot proficiency training, or FCFs are accom-
     plished after 16 hours and no IFR events are accomplished after 18 hours. If the autopilot is not oper-
     ational or its use is denied for more than 8 hours, the CDD will be 16 hours. If the autopilot fails after
     departure, continue to the next scheduled stop and then comply with the basic CDD limitations.
        3.7.2.1. Augmented CDD requires the minimum inflight crew rest facilities of 4 bunks.
     3.7.3. CDD length will be based on the mission to be performed. For example, if the planned mission
     duration is 15 hours from show time to termination, then a basic CDD is appropriate even if the crew
     is augmented. Once established, a basic CDD will not be changed to an augmented CDD, regardless
     of crew composition. Operational and DV missions are always considered augmented CDD.
     3.7.4. Deadhead time before or after performing primary crew duties is CDT. Crewmembers may
     perform primary crew duties after deadheading if their CDT will not exceed a basic CDD for the mis-
     sion. Crewmembers may deadhead following primary crew duties if their CDT will not exceed 24
     hours.
     3.7.5. CDT for flight examiners administering flight evaluations and not occupying a primary crew
     position will not exceed the augmented CDD.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                             17

   3.7.6. Aircraft commanders may extend CDD by up to 2 hours if the mission priority justifies the risk
   and the PIC is unable to contact the waiver authority. AFSOC/DO authorizes this IAW AFI 11-202
   Volume 3 Chapter 9. (If this option is used, aircraft commanders should coordinate with command
   and control agencies so downstream activities are not adversely affected) This extension is not to be
   used as a planning consideration. All other CDD extensions require wing or group commander, or
   COMAFSOF approval. All CDD waivers require the aircraft commander’s concurrence. Do not give
   crewmembers less than 12 hours crew rest without wing or group commander or COMAFSOF
   approval.

3.8. Alert Duty:
   3.8.1. Alert duty is defined as any period during which a alert crew is on call to perform a specific
   mission. Prior to entering crew rest, an aircrew will be given an expected alert time for the mission.

NOTE:
Waiver authority for paragraph 3.8. is wing or group commander, or COMAFSOF.
   3.8.2. Publish unit alerting procedures in the supplement to this volume. A minimum of 2 hours from
   arrival at aircraft to stations time for crewmembers to complete preflight duties (if not previously pre-
   flighted) should be provided.
   3.8.3. Alert personnel are those required to be on duty for the prompt execution of the mission. Alert
   crews will be readily available in a location, which allows the crew to meet the required time to launch
   from notification.
   3.8.4. The alert duty period will begin at a scheduled time which is determined by the unit/mission
   commander. Provide aircrew members an inviolate 12 hours crew rest prior to alert duty. The unit/
   mission commander will determine the length of the alert period, not to exceed 72 hours. Predepar-
   ture crew rest is waived for flight surgeons or medical technicians who are on alert duty for urgent
   aero-medical evacuation missions.
   3.8.5. Flying the alert crew:
      3.8.5.1. CDT starts when the crew reports for any duty within the alert period.
      3.8.5.2. If the alert crew is launched and returns with CDT remaining, they may be launched
      again within the constraints of that crew day. Numerous circumstances may arise that affect the
      decision to replace the alert crew and each incident must be evaluated on an individual basis.
   3.8.6. If the alert crew completes 12 consecutive hours of crew rest between flights or official duties,
   the previous CDT period no longer applies and the cycle can be started anew provided the crew does
   not remain on alert for more than 72 hours from their initial assumption of alert.
   3.8.7. The alert crew will not perform other official duties (e.g., additional duties, commander’s call,
   safety meeting, etc.).
   3.8.8. A alert crew will not remain in alert status for more than 2 consecutive 72-hour alert periods.
   The crew will receive 12 hours of premission crew rest between the first and second alert periods.
   3.8.9. Provide post-alert crew rest for crews required to stand alert at locations other than their normal
   domicile. Provide 1 hour of crew rest for every 3 hours on alert. This time off does not include the
   normal 12 hours for crew rest prior to assuming another alert period or flying mission.

NOTES:
1. An FA is only required when passengers are carried. One FA (First FA qualified) is required if 21 or
less passengers are carried. Two FAs (one of which is First FA qualified) are required for more than 21
passengers. Mission and/or passenger requirements may dictate up to four FAs. Unit DO will determine
CSO and FA requirements for each mission.
2. The aircraft commander must be instructor or flight examiner qualified on DV Code 6 or higher mis-
sions.
3. Required if any IFR events are planned after 14 hours CDT. Requires two IFR qualified aircraft com-
manders.

                             COMMAND OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. Objectives. A fully mission capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the logistics effort. The
final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the aircraft commander. If one
aircraft commander accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system,
this acceptance does not commit that aircraft commander, or a different aircraft commander, to subse-
quent operations with the same item or system inoperative.

4.2. Policy. The Minimum Equipment Listing (MEL) is the operating guideline. It lists the equipment
and systems considered essential for routine operations and provides guidance on how to operate with
degraded equipment. The aircraft commander is the approving authority for operations with degraded
equipment within the guidelines of the MEL and needs no further approval. Operating outside of MEL
guidelines for routine operations requires wing or group commander, or COMAFSOF approval. For con-
tingency operations, the aircraft commander is the approving authority for operating outside of MEL
guidelines and needs no further approval.

Section 5A—GeneralOperating Policies

5.1. Takeoff and Landing Policy:
     5.1.1. The pilot in command will occupy either the left or right seat during all takeoffs and landings.
     5.1.2. Instructor and flight examiner pilots may takeoff or land from either seat under any condition.
     5.1.3. An aircraft commander qualified pilot may make takeoffs and landings from either seat.
     5.1.4. An aircraft commander qualified pilot will land from the left seat during:
        5.1.4.1. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
        5.1.4.2. DV Code 6 or higher missions.
        5.1.4.3. Situations when, in the opinion of the aircraft commander, marginal conditions exists.
     5.1.5. Aircraft commanders who possess less than 100 hours in type in the EC-137D aircraft since
     initial upgrade will make all takeoffs and landings from the left seat when in command. These aircraft
     commanders may allow instructor and flight examiner pilots to make takeoffs and landings for cur-
     rency.

5.2. Aircraft Maximum Gross Weight Policy. Comply with the limitations of the aircraft Operations
Manual.

5.3. Landing Gear and Flap Operation Inflight:
     5.3.1. The pilot in the right seat will operate the landing gear. Actuate the landing gear only after
     command of the pilot flying the aircraft. Prior to actuation of the landing gear, the other pilot will
     acknowledge the command by repeating it.
     5.3.2. The pilot in the right seat will operate the flaps. Actuate the flaps only after command by the
     pilot flying the aircraft. Prior to actuation of the flaps, the other pilot will acknowledge the command
     by repeating it.

5.4. Use of Outside Observers. It may be necessary to use crewmembers to assist in outside watch dur-
ing taxi operations and inflight during arrivals and departures.

5.5. Seat Belts:
     5.5.1. Crewmembers occupying either the pilot, copilot, or flight engineer seat will have seat belts
     fastened at all times.
     5.5.2. All occupants will be seated with seat belts fastened during taxi, takeoffs and landings. Excep-
     tion: Flight examiners, instructors, mission commanders, outside observers during taxi, flight engi-
     neers, and FAs performing required duties are exempt; however, they will have a designated seat and
     required restraint available.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                              21

   5.5.3. Provide a safety belt for all occupants over 2 years of age. Occupants will fasten seat belts
   securely when turbulence is encountered or anticipated, or in areas of forecast clear air turbulence.

5.6. Aircraft Lighting: Comply with AFI 11-202 Volume 3 Chapter 5 and the following guidance.
   5.6.1. Use landing/runway turnoff lights at night in unlighted areas. Use the landing/runway turnoff
   lights during night takeoffs. Use landing lights inflight any time the landing gear is extended unless
   reflections cause pilot distractions in instrument conditions.
   5.6.2. Use beacon lights while engines are running and from takeoff to landing on all flights. PIC
   may turn off beacon lights when it is in the best interest of safety to do so. AFI 11-202 Volume 3
   allows for continuation of the mission with the failure of any light in the beacon light system to the
   first stop where repairs can be made. Refer to the MEL for further guidance of operations with inop-
   erative beacon lights.
   5.6.3. Landing lights/wing illumination lights should normally be on in addition to position and bea-
   con lights during operations below 18,000 feet. Landing lights may be used continuously during local
   traffic pattern training and during low altitude maneuvering in high-density traffic areas.
   5.6.4. Contingency operations may dictate that external lights are off and internal lights are limited to
   the minimum necessary for aircrew activities.

5.7. Advisory Calls. Mandatory advisory calls for the pilot not flying the aircraft are as follows:
   5.7.1. Nonprecision Approaches:
       5.7.1.1. One hundred feet above minimum altitudes.
       5.7.1.2. "Minimums" at the MDA.
       5.7.1.3. "Runway in sight." Make this call when the runway environment is in sight. Do not call
       too soon when obstructions to vision, such as fog, haze, low stratus clouds, etc., are present.
       5.7.1.4. "Go-around." Call at missed approach point if the runway environment is not in sight or
       if the aircraft is not in a position to make a normal landing. This call can be made anytime if the
       aircraft is not in a position to make a safe landing or obstructions to the landing are present on the
       runway.
   5.7.2. Precision Approaches:
       5.7.2.1. One hundred feet above decision height (DH).
       5.7.2.2. "Land." Make this call at decision height if the runway environment is in sight and the
       aircraft is in a position for a normal landing.
       5.7.2.3. "Go-around." Make this call at decision height if the runway environment is not in sight
       or if the aircraft is not in a position for a normal landing. This call can be made anytime if the air-
       craft is not in a position to make a safe landing or obstructions to the landing are present on the
       runway.
   5.7.3. Climb out:
       5.7.3.1. Transition altitude.
       5.7.3.2. One thousand feet below assigned altitude.
22                                                                   AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

     5.7.4. Descent:
        5.7.4.1. Transition level.
        5.7.4.2. One thousand feet above assigned altitude.
        5.7.4.3. One thousand feet above initial approach fix altitude or holding altitude.
        5.7.4.4. One hundred feet above procedure turn and final approach fix altitude.

5.8. Communications Policy:
     5.8.1. Aircraft Interphone:
        5.8.1.1. All crewmembers will monitor interphone. FAs are required to monitor interphone for
        taxi, take-off, descent-approach and landing only. Crewmembers will notify the pilot before going
        off headset and advise when back on headset.
        5.8.1.2. Any crewmember seeing a deviation of 200 feet in planned altitude, or deviations in
        heading, airspeed, or potential terrain or obstruction clearance problems will notify the pilot
        immediately.
        5.8.1.3. During takeoff roll, the pilot not flying the aircraft will state "80 Knots", “V-One”,
        “Rotate”, and “V2” at the computed speeds. Any crewmember noting a safety of flight malfunc-
        tion before hearing "V-One" will state "Reject" and give a brief description of the malfunction.
        The pilot flying will make the final decision to reject or continue the takeoff.
        5.8.1.4. Do not discuss classified information on the interphone during radio transmissions.
        5.8.1.5. Classified interphone or radio transmissions will be recorded on the cockpit voice
        recorder if it is operating. Ensure the CVR tape is erased after each flight and prior to leaving the
        aircraft. Flight engineers will use the following procedures to erase the CVR after engine shut-
        down.
        5.8.1.6. After the aircraft is on APU or external power and the parking brake is set, press the CVR
        erase button a minimum of 2 seconds.
        5.8.1.7. Non-aircrew members will monitor interphone or radio transmissions only when this has
        been specifically approved by the aircraft commander. The AC will brief communications policy
        to these personnel prior to flight. The AC must ensure no one monitors classified information they
        are not cleared for, or transmits classified information over the radios.
     5.8.2. Command Radios:
        5.8.2.1. The pilot not flying the aircraft normally makes all radio calls.
        5.8.2.2. All crewmembers will monitor the primary radio unless specifically directed to do other-
        wise by the aircraft commander or other chapters of this instruction. If the primary radio is HF, the
        aircraft commander will direct a crewmember to monitor it.
        5.8.2.3. The pilot operating command radios will tell the crew which radio is primary.
        5.8.2.4. Pilots or a designated crewmember are responsible for ensuring emergency frequencies
        are monitored at all times.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                         23

       5.8.2.5. During emergencies, request simultaneous UHF and VHF transmissions when operating
       in a terminal area under radar control.
       5.8.2.6. One of the pilots will record and read back all ATC clearances. The CSO will record the
       clearance and monitor the read back. This includes all transmissions pertaining to ATC instruc-
       tions involving departure, en route, and approach procedures. Disregard this procedure when ATC
       instructions require immediate execution, or when such action interferes with timely completion
       of more important duties.
       5.8.2.7. The CSO will be used to provide communications with operational headquarters, com-
       manders, or designated personnel.

Section 5B—GeneralAirland Procedures

5.9. Wind Limitations. The maximum limiting crosswind value has not been determined. Maximum
demonstrated crosswind landings are 33 knots for the EC-137D. Consult the Operations and Performance
Manuals when operating in crosswind conditions.

5.10. Runway and Taxiway Requirements. Minimum runway criteria for normal operations are
listed below. Compute landing performance with no reverse and full brakes. The desired approach zone
gradient is 50:1 , but no greater than 35:1. The group commander may waive runway and taxiway width
requirements.
   5.10.1. Takeoff. Minimum runway length required is FAR Takeoff Field Length.
   5.10.2. Landing. Minimum runway length required is FAR Landing Field Length.
   5.10.3. Minimum runway width is 148 feet or 45 meters. Refer to Figure 5.1. for obstruction clear-
   ance. Minimum runway width may be waived to 98 feet or 30 meters.
   5.10.4. Minimum taxiway width is 50 feet or 15 meters. Refer to Figure 5.2. for obstruction clear-
   ance.

5.11. Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria:
   5.11.1. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet; with wing walkers by at
   least 10 feet. Refer to Figure 5.1. and Figure 5.2. for more specific guidance.
   5.11.2. Whenever taxi clearance is doubtful, use a wing walker. If wing walkers are unavailable,
   deplane a crewmember to maintain obstruction clearance.
   5.11.3. Use idle thrust when practical. If foreign object damage (FOD) is a problem, the outboard
   engines may be shut down provided gross weight, taxiway, and weather are favorable. Verify all
   sources of brake pressure before shutting down symmetrical engines.

5.12. Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Criteria:
   5.12.1. The mission directive is confirmation that AFSOC/CC, or COMAFSOF with area jurisdic-
   tion has reviewed the airfields of intended operation for obstructions and other hazards in accordance
   with Air Force and AFSOC directives. The wing or group commander, or COMAFSOF will advise
   crews of known obstructions and other factors that could be hazardous to airland operations. This
   does not relieve the crew from proper mission planning including obstacle clearance on the
24                                                                      AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

     approaches and departures. Aircraft commanders will not make an approach and landing into an air-
     field requiring certification by the HQ AMC Airfield Suitability Report, unless they have previously
     operated into that airfield as a pilot, copilot, or observer and have reviewed the airfield certification
     briefing and audiovisual program within the last 14 days. Waiver authority for the Airfield Suitability
     Report rests with the AFSOC/DO.
     5.12.2. Take-offs and landings on runways equipped with arresting cables. The following informa-
     tion applies to all runways equipped with BAK 9, 12 and 13 (Navy designation E-28) cables. It does
     not apply to runways equipped with BAK 14 cables that are in the recessed position.
         5.12.2.1. Do not land on the cable. Landing on the cable may damage the aircraft or cable.
         5.12.2.2. If the aircraft lands before the cable, crews should contact the tower to have the cable
         inspected.
         5.12.2.3. Do not take-off or land over an approach end cable that has been reported by NOTAM,
         ATIS or air traffic controllers as slack, loose or improperly rigged.
         5.12.2.4. Units may develop local procedures for their specific runway environments.
         5.12.2.5. Aircraft operations manuals, FLIP, NOTAMS or summary of airfield restrictions may
         have additional restrictions for take-offs or landings over raised cables. Those restrictions take
         precedence over this guidance.

5.13. Reverse Taxi. This procedure should only be used in situations when aircraft movement is critical
and no other means exists to accomplish the task. Use extreme caution while backing the aircraft due to
inherent hazards.
     5.13.1. The pilot will coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals to be used with the marshaller.
     5.13.2. Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated.
     5.13.3. During night reverse taxi operations, the pilot will ensure that visibility in the taxi area is suf-
     ficient to conduct safe taxi operations.
     5.13.4. Stop no less than 25 feet from an obstruction even if using a wing walker.
     5.13.5. Use forward thrust as a means of stopping the aircraft during reverse taxi.

5.14. Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the approved usable por-
tion of the runway. The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the aircraft commander.
Base TOLD card computations on the runway remaining at the point the takeoff is initiated.

5.15. Reduced Power Operations. Reduced power operations are intended to prolong engine service
life. Takeoffs should normally be accomplished using reduced power unless operational requirements dic-
tate otherwise.

5.16. Three-Engine Takeoffs. Actual engine-out takeoffs require HQ AFSOC/DO waiver. Crews will
review and follow the limitations and procedures addressed in the Airplane Flight Manual, Appendix A.

5.17. Aircraft Recovery From Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not normally attempt to
recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto soft, unprepared surfaces which are not suitable for taxi.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                              25

Ground crews using the appropriate equipment will accomplish aircraft recovery. Aircrews may accom-
plish recovery at austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the aircraft commander is sure there is no
damage and the surface will support the aircraft. If there is damage or if there is any doubt that the surface
will support the aircraft, aircrews will not attempt recovery. Aircraft commanders will notify the unit
commander prior to moving the aircraft if conditions permit.

5.18. Engines Running Onload or Offload (ERO). Use ERO procedures only when necessary to
expedite aircraft movement or meet time requirements.
   5.18.1. The ERO procedures in this paragraph may be used for any mix of personnel or cargo. The
   airstairs is preferred over the maintenance access door (lower 41). Aircraft commanders will assess
   prevailing weather, lighting, and parking location to ensure a safe operation.
   5.18.2. General Procedures:
       5.18.2.1. Aircraft commanders will brief crewmembers on the intended ERO operation, empha-
       sizing specific crewmember duties.
       5.18.2.2. The parking brake will be set and one pilot will monitor brakes, interphone, and radio.
       5.18.2.3. Operate engines in idle thrust. If conditions warrant, lower flaps to reduce jet blast aft
       of the aircraft.
       CAUTION: Due to hazards involved (e.g., jet blast, proximity to engines, etc.), only hand trans-
       ferable items may be on or off loaded.
       5.18.2.4. Turn wing illumination lights on during night ERO.
       5.18.2.5. The aircraft commander will assign a crewmember (normally the FA) to direct all
       onload and offload operations.
       5.18.2.6. After clearance from the pilot, open the briefed exit.
       5.18.2.7. During enplaning and deplaning, position a crewmember (normally the FA) as an air-
       craft security and safety observer.
       5.18.2.8. Enplaning or deplaning personnel will be escorted by a crewmember. Brief these per-
       sonnel to remain clear of hazardous areas. Deplane passengers before cargo and enplane passen-
       gers after cargo unless cargo size or location dictates otherwise.
       5.18.2.9. Complete passenger and cargo manifests, crew lists, and DD Form 365-4, Weight and
       Balance Clearance Form F-Transport, for the subsequent sortie. NOTE: DD Form 365-4 is not
       required for subsequent sortie if aircraft departs empty.
       5.18.2.10. Resume taxi after the door warning light is out and when the assigned crewmember has
       verbally acknowledged that the aircraft is ready for taxiing.
   5.18.3. ERO for crew changes during local training missions is authorized. Keep ERO for crew
   changes to the absolute minimum necessary to accomplish the mission.

                               GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 6A—Premission

6.1. Aircrew Uniforms. Wear the aircrew uniform on all missions, unless other attire is authorized. Do
not wear scarves while in, on, or around aircraft. When the USAF Foreign Clearance Guide requires
civilian attire, wear conservatively styled civilian clothing.

6.2. Personal and Professional Equipment. Crewmembers will carry or wear personal and professional
equipment as follows:
     6.2.1. Carry a headset and operable flashlight on all flights. Quick-don oxygen masks are installed,
     they will be preflighted (to include communications hook up) if they are used as the primary oxygen
     source.
     6.2.2. Passports. Carry passports on missions when required by the Foreign Clearance Guide.
     6.2.3. Shot Records. Carry shot records on all missions outside the CONUS, Alaska, or Hawaii. Air-
     crew members will ensure they meet immunization requirements for the mission.
     6.2.4. Jewelry. Do not wear finger rings, earrings, or other loose fitting jewelry while in, on, or
     around aircraft.
     6.2.5. Glasses. Wear prescribed glasses or contact lenses as required by AFI 11-202 Volume 3.
     6.2.6. Restricted Area Badges. Carry the restricted area badge on all missions (except contingency
     missions). Display the badge only in designated restricted areas.

6.3. Tool Kits. A tool kit will be on board for all flights. The unit will establish requirements for tools to
be included in these kits and the crewmember responsible for the kit.

6.4. Publications. Primary crewmembers will carry the publications specified in Figure 6.1. on all mis-
sions. This requirement may be satisfied if fully posted publications are kept on board the aircraft. For
multiple crew positions, crewmembers may coordinate to see that all required publications are carried.

6.5. Airfield Review. Aircraft commanders and other appropriate crewmembers will review all appropri-
ate publications (e.g., FLIP, Jeppesen, HQ AMC Airfield Suitability and Restriction Report (ASRR) etc.)
to determine airfield suitability. Crewmembers will review the HQ AMC Airfield Suitability and Restric-
tion Report (ASRR) for any mission that will land/operate away from home station. If available, review
the airport qualification audiovisual program. Crews will check the suitability codes and, if possible,
adhere to all restrictions for an airfield. Since the EC-137 aircraft is not identified in the ASRR, KC-135
restrictions will apply. If a restriction applies to KC-135 aircraft, AFSOC EC-137 crews must comply.
Waiver authority for ASRR restrictions is AFSOC/DO. Process waivers through stan/eval channels. See
AFI 11-202 Volume 3, Chapter 2 and the AFSOC SUP to Volume 3.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                              29

NOTE:
HQ AMC updates the ASRR on the internet between formal publications. Updates may be found at
www.safb.af.mil:81/hqamc/diratorates/amcdo/doa/doas.htm

Section 6B—Predeparture

6.6. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). Review Volume I, part A, of the FCIF before all missions.
   6.6.1. If material has been added to the FCIF since the last review, enter the latest FCIF item number,
   date, and initials on the AFSOC Form 11, FCIF Currency Record.
   6.6.2. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF review and joining a mission en route will receive an FCIF
   update from their primary aircrew member counterpart on that mission. Instructor pilots flying with
   general officers are responsible for briefing appropriate FCIF items.
   6.6.3. Crewmembers not assigned or attached to that unit will certify FCIF review by entering the last
   FCIF number and their initials beside their name on the file copy of the flight authorization or their
   ACM orders.

6.7. Unit Mission Kits. Carry unit mission kits on all special mission, , and any other mission designated
by the unit DO. The minimum contents of the mission kits are specified in this instruction and by the unit
DO. Prior to off-station departures, the aircraft commander or a designated representative will ensure a
current mission kit is on board the aircraft. The kit will contain, but is not limited to, the items listed in
Figure 6.2. Items required by a unit or wing directive to be carried onboard the aircraft or by an individual
crewmember need not be duplicated in the mission kit. Maintain sufficient quantities of directives and
planning documents to allow implementation of evacuation and contingency plans.

Section 6C—Briefings

6.8. Requirements:
   6.8.1. Briefings should be clear, concise, and designed to provide mission essential information. Sup-
   plement and shorten briefings with visual aids, flimsies, checklists, etc., when practical. Avoid need-
   less repetition of published procedures. Schedule briefings after considering the particular mission,
   crew rest, and other pertinent factors. Aircrew members must be provided all applicable information
   available to ensure complete and professional aircrew planning.
   6.8.2. Crewmembers will not fly unless they attend the crew briefings for their mission. Exception:
   When preflight requirements dictate, aircraft commanders may excuse certain crewmembers from the
   briefing. The aircraft commander will ensure that those personnel receive a face-to-face briefing prior
   to engine start.
   6.8.3. Weather Briefings. A weather briefing is required prior to all flights. The aircraft commander
   or other crewmembers designated by the aircraft commander will be briefed on the current weather
   trends and forecast for the proposed route, destinations and alternates. See AFI 11-202 Volume 3 and
   AFSOC Sup for further guidance.
   6.8.4. Aircraft Commander’s Crew Briefing. Give this briefing before the first flight of the mission
   and for subsequent flights when crewmember substitutions are made or operating procedures change
   from the original briefing. To reduce ground operating time on the aircraft, the departure briefing may
   be accomplished at this briefing, except for takeoff data and departure instructions.
   6.8.5. Departure and Arrival Briefings. Conduct these briefings in accordance with the operations
   manual.
   6.8.6. Passenger Briefings. The aircraft commander or designated representative will brief passen-
   gers in accordance with applicable passenger briefing checklist.
   6.8.7. Specialist Briefings. Use specialist briefings to detail operating procedures or special interest
   items to various crew positions and to answer questions relating to those specialties. The mission
   commander will determine when specialist briefings are required.

Section 6D—FlightPlanning

6.9. Adherence To Rules. Comply with AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules; Foreign Clearance
Guide; Flight Information Publication (FLIP); and this instruction.

6.10. Call Signs. Use voice call sign listing (VCSL) or as specified in mission directives for all missions
except local area training missions. Use standard call signs for local area training missions.
   6.10.1. Diplomatic (DIP) Clearance. Certain countries grant DIP clearance by mission number. Pass
   the mission number and call sign to the controlling agency upon entering such country’s airspace and
   then use the call sign directed by that agency.

6.11. Instrument Flight Rules. All missions will use IFR to the maximum extent possible. If the mis-
sion cannot be accomplished satisfactorily or flying safety dictates otherwise, then VFR is authorized.
Local training missions will be conducted under instrument flight rules and under the control of an en
route air traffic control or approach control facility, except:
32                                                                  AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

     6.11.1. When operating in Category D or G airspace.
     6.11.2. When conducting air work maneuvers required for evaluation or training. In this case, the fol-
     lowing will apply:
        6.11.2.1. Flight to and from the area in which air work will be accomplished should be conducted
        under the control of an en route air traffic control or approach control facility.
        6.11.2.2. If possible, air work will be accomplished within an assigned block altitude. When
        unable to obtain an assigned block altitude, air work may be accomplished under VFR.
     6.11.3. During VFR operations, all aircraft will use radar advisory service to the maximum extent
     possible.
     6.11.4. Normally, conduct air refueling and inflight refueling on an IFR clearance. Refueling may be
     conducted under VFR when coordinated with the controlling ARTCC. VFR refueling tracks may be
     established when coordinated IAW FAA Handbook 7610.4H, Chapter 3. Inflight refueling under Due
     Regard procedures is permitted only with tanker concurrence and when operational requirements dic-
     tate.

6.12. Flight Plans:
     6.12.1. Regardless of whether a flight plan is prepared by the aircrew or is furnished by another
     agency, the aircraft commander will verify routes and flight altitudes to ensure proper terrain clear-
     ance.
     6.12.2. Unscheduled changes in crew, passenger, and aeromedical patient lists are authorized pro-
     vided corrections to the crew list or passenger manifest are filed with the local command and control
     center, base operations, FAA office, or airport manager’s office, at the airfield being transited.
     6.12.3. Crews may use flight plans or AF Form 70, Pilots’ Flight Plan and Flight Log.

6.13. International Procedures:
     6.13.1. Review the USAF Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) and brief crewmembers on applicable
     items before flying outside the CONUS.
     6.13.2. Complete customs, immigration, agriculture, immunization, and quarantine as specified in the
     USAF FCG. The unit dispatching the mission is responsible for border clearance and other special
     clearances, when required (see paragraph 6.69.).

6.14. Departure Planning. Standard instrument departures (SID) or radar vectors are preferred methods
of departure. If not available, use approved departure routings specified by the departure facility. Regard-
less of departure method, consider the type of terrain and other obstructions on or in the vicinity of the
planned departure route. Comply with guidance in AFI 11-202 Volume 3 Chapter 8.
     6.14.1. IMC Climbout. In addition to guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, the aircraft must be capa-
     ble of climbing at 3.0% climb gradient with one engine inoperative. The 3.0% climb gradient with one
     engine inoperative, in all cases, meets or exceeds the 152 feet per nautical mile climb requirement
     specified in AFMAN 11-217, Instrument Flight Procedures.
     6.14.2. VMC Climbout. Even when obstacles are not a factor, the aircraft must be capable of climb-
     ing at a rate of at least 200 ft/mile on all engines at or above V2.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                           33

   6.14.3. AF SIDS assume zero feet altitude at the departure end of the runway and then 200 feet per
   nautical mile as the minimum climb gradient unless otherwise specified. All other departure proce-
   dures are based on 35 feet altitude at the departure end and then 200 feet per mile unless otherwise
   specified.
   6.14.4. For all IFR flights, the approach facility upon which minimums are based must be operational
   at the departure base and departure alternate, and approach equipment in the aircraft must be opera-
   tional. Use runway visual range (RVR), when available, to determine the minimum visibility required
   for takeoff.
   6.14.5. The minimum en route altitude will be the highest minimum en route altitude along a route
   segment except when under positive radar control.

6.15. Alternate Planning: Comply with guidance in AFI 11-202 Volume 3 Chapter 8.

6.16. Takeoff Minimums. If the departure weather is below published landing minimums, plan for a
departure alternate IAW See AFI 11-202 Volume 3 Chapter 8.

6.17. Destination and Inflight Refueling Abort Alternates. Alternate requirements will be IAW AFI
11-202 Volume 3 Chapter 8. and AFSOC SUP.
   6.17.1. Aircraft must be able to maintain MEA to the alternate if an engine fails.
   6.17.2. If the destination is remote, or an island, with no alternate available, add 1 +15 hours holding
   fuel in lieu of an alternate.

6.18. Adverse Weather Planning. Plan all missions to avoid areas of severe weather, including icing or
severe turbulence. Avoid thunderstorms and cumulonimbus clouds (CBs) using the following criteria:
   6.18.1. Climb Out, En Route, and Descent:
       6.18.1.1. FL 230 and Above: 20 NM.
       6.18.1.2. Below FL 230: 10 NM.
       6.18.1.3. Contingency operations below FL 230: 5 NM. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding
       a rapidly moving thunderstorm.
       6.18.1.4. Clear the top of a known or suspected severe thunderstorm by at least 2,000 feet altitude.
       Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a rapidly moving thunderstorm.
       6.18.1.5. Avoid the rain shaft and cloud base of thunderstorms and CBs using the criteria of
       6.18.1.2. and 6.18.1.3. above. Do not fly under the anvil of a cumulonimbus cloud.
       6.18.1.6. Avoid thunderstorms visually, by airborne radar, or by specific request of a
       ground-based radar with a weather painting capability. When relying exclusively on
       ground-based radar for weather avoidance and the ground controller is unable to provide avoid-
       ance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
          6.18.1.6.1. Changing routing.
          6.18.1.6.2. Diverting to alternate.
34                                                                  AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

            6.18.1.6.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance if unable to maintain
            VMC in an area of significant weather and the ground radar facility cannot provide weather
            avoidance service.
        6.18.1.7. The use of ground-based radar as the primary means of thunderstorm avoidance should
        be used only to depart an area of significant weather. It should never be considered a normal
        avoidance procedure.
     6.18.2. Takeoff and Landing. The size and intensity of thunderstorms or CBs are so variable that the
     aircraft commander must determine avoidance criteria to be used during takeoff and landing. Takeoff
     and landing may be made without regard to the criteria in 6.18.1. provided:
        6.18.2.1. The thunderstorm or CBs and associated gust front, if present, can be avoided.
        6.18.2.2. The distance from the thunderstorm or CBs is increased as soon as possible after takeoff
        to meet the criteria in 6.18.1.
        6.18.2.3. A missed approach course from the missed approach point is available which will pro-
        vide separation similar to that for departures.
        6.18.2.4. The aircraft is not flown below thunderstorms, CBs, or through the rain shaft associated
        with these clouds. Takeoffs and landings should not be normally made into areas with reported
        wind shears.
     6.18.3. Lightning Avoidance. Lightning occurs at all levels in a thunderstorm. The majority of light-
     ning discharges never strike the ground but occur between clouds or within the same cloud at nearly
     all temperatures and altitudes. Lightning also occurs in the clear air around the top and sides of
     storms. Avoid prolonged flight in the conditions most favorable for lightning strikes including: OAT
     between +8 degrees C and -8 degrees C and in clouds, precipitation, or turbulence.

6.19. Fuel Planning. Use the appropriate performance sections of the Operations Manual for fuel plan-
ning. While flying at long-range cruise (LRC) at the cruise ceiling is the most conservative method and
therefore encouraged, aircraft commanders may elect to fly at other speeds and altitudes deemed appro-
priate for the mission.
     6.19.1. Add extra fuel:
        6.19.1.1. When fuel is unavailable at en route stops; when compressed ground times during sin-
        gle-day, multi-sortie missions preclude refueling at each en route stop; or when en route refueling
        would delay or be detrimental to mission accomplishment.
        6.19.1.2. When passengers or patients are on board, to recover at a suitable airfield from ETP at
        10,000 feet MSL in the event of unpressurized flight.
     6.19.2. Required Fuel At Destination. Minimum fuel overhead destination or alternate is 15,000
     pounds. Land with a minimum of 10,000 pounds fuel remaining.
     6.19.3. Fuel Conservation. Make every reasonable effort to conserve fuel. Some recommended
     methods are:
        6.19.3.1. Normally for best fuel mileage, the aircraft should be flown within 2000 ft (above or
        below) of optimum altitude. Step climb if practical.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                            35

       6.19.3.2. Fly missions at the most fuel conservative cruise speed option. On missions which are
       time rather than distance oriented, consider flying the lowest practical cruise option. Aircraft
       commanders are encouraged to fly long-range cruise airspeeds on other missions if practical.
       6.19.3.3. Use idle thrust or two engine symmetrical power when practical for ground operation.
       6.19.3.4. Cruise at the altitude that gives the best ground distance traveled for each pound of fuel
       consumed. As a rule of thumb, climb if ground speed is reduced less than 5 knots for each 1,000
       feet of altitude increase. Descend if ground speed will increase more than 5 knots for each 1,000
       feet of altitude decrease. Do not fly above cruise ceiling.

6.20. Authenticators and Classified Documents. Obtain and safeguard current authenticators and other
classified materials required for the area being transited. Carry authenticators when flying into an ADIZ,
participating in exercises, on overseas missions, deployments, and when specified in operation plans. The
COMSEC material required depends on the theater of operation and user. The base COMSEC custodian
has access to the AFKAG 44/AFKAG 14 and can assist in obtaining the material required for the mission.
Base operations at AMC bases maintains the COMSEC material used on most missions.

6.21. Mission Folder. Develop a mission folder for each mission to ensure all predeparture information
is available to aircrews. This folder will include the AFSOC Form 41, Flight Authorization, and other
forms and information required for the mission.

6.22. Navigation Kits:
   6.22.1. The aircraft commander will be issued a route navigation kit at the home station which will
   remain with the aircraft until its return. Kits should contain sufficient quantities of material to cover
   the complete round trip from the issuing station and return, plus appropriate materials to cover the the-
   ater of operation.
   6.22.2. Segregate route navigation kits into two separate parts:
       6.22.2.1. Part I. Sufficient material to cover the planned route trip and theater of operation.
       6.22.2.2. Part II. For intertheater missions only. Maps, charts, and flight information publica-
       tions for global operation, excluding items in Part I.
   6.22.3. The COMAFSOF may augment kits as necessary to meet special operational requirements.
   6.22.4. Minimum contents of route navigation kits will be in accordance with Figure 6.3. Command-
   ers may modify the items as necessary for local training missions.

Section 6E—Preflight

6.23. EC-137D Preflight. When an aircrew assumes a preflighted aircraft or quick-turn, a thorough
visual inspection will be performed, paying particular attention to areas affected by maintenance or ser-
vicing.

6.24. Maintenance Record. Review the Maintenance Record before applying power to the aircraft or
operating aircraft systems. Ensure the USAF Fuel Identaplate is on board the aircraft.

6.25. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight, with a condition which might
be hazardous for continued use, if the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another station. Waiver author-
ity is HQ AFSOC/DO.
     6.25.1. The chief of maintenance, the senior maintenance officer, or the chief of the repair team must
     first authorize the release.
     6.25.2. After the maintenance release is obtained, contact AFSOC for flight authorization.
     6.25.3. The maintenance release, AFSOC approval, and the aircraft commander’s concurrence are all
     required before the aircraft can be flown to the specified destination.

6.26. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations:
     6.26.1. Aircraft Refueling. Use primary fuel management IAW the aircraft operations manual when-
     ever practical. Aircrew members qualified in refueling may perform refueling duties at austere loca-
     tions or at stations without maintenance support. Maintenance personnel should be scheduled on
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                             37

   those missions where a need is anticipated. Two qualified personnel are required. Aircrews should
   not refuel except in cases when maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be
   delayed.
   6.26.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Simultaneous aircraft refueling or defueling and cargo load-
   ing or maintenance operations is authorized IAW TO 00-25-172. Refueling or defueling with passen-
   gers or patients on board is authorized IAW TO 00-25-172.
   6.26.3. Crash, Fire, and Rescue Protection. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the
   minimum requirements for fire protection during engine start. If available, position a portable fire
   extinguisher for added fire protection.
   6.26.4. Aircrew/Maintenance Engine Run-ups. A mixed aircrew/maintenance engine run will not be
   accomplished.
   6.26.5. Towing. Aircrew members normally will not participate in towing operations. The aircraft
   commander will coordinate with the senior maintenance person to ensure the towing supervisor and
   crew are qualified. At non-USAF installations, the aircraft commander must have approval from the
   airfield operations officer or manager prior to towing. The aircraft commander will ensure that the
   tow team supervisor briefs all personnel on their duties and the associated hazards. Proper checklists
   will be used. If any doubt exists as to the qualification of tow team personnel or the safety of the oper-
   ation, make no attempt to tow the aircraft until qualified personnel can be located. Aircrew members
   normally will not act as the towing supervisor. Refer to Towing OI 10-104 for more specific guidance

6.27. Life Support Requirements:
   6.27.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff will be sufficient to accomplish the planned mission
   IAW the Operations Manual. On missions with passengers, carry passenger oxygen kits (POK) if
   flight above FL 250 is anticipated. Ensure access to POKs is not blocked during flight. Distribute
   POKs and demonstrate their use prior to exceeding FL 250. The POK provides no protection when
   ambient air contains smoke or fumes.
   6.27.2. Rafts. Ensure sufficient life rafts are on board to accommodate all passengers and aircrew
   members on overwater flights.
   6.27.3. Life Preserver Units (LPUs). Ensure a sufficient quantity of life preservers is on board and
   available for all passengers and crewmembers for overwater flights. While overwater, LPUs will be
   available at the crewmember’s station, and worn whenever below 2,000 feet overwater (except for
   takeoff and landing). For overwater missions carrying children and infants, ensure appropriate num-
   ber and type of LPUs are on board.
   6.27.4. Anti-exposure suits. The use of anti-exposure suits will be IAW AFSOCI 11-301, Aircrew
   Life Support Program.

6.28. Life Support Equipment Documentation. Life support will accomplish a thorough aircraft pre-
flight inspection prior to each off station mission. Life support will, also, accomplish a thorough aircraft
postflight inspection after each off station mission. Local training missions only require an aircrew pre-
flight inspection prior to the first flight of the day. Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will
make an entry in the aircraft maintenance forms.
38                                                                  AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

6.29. IFF/SIF Operations:
     6.29.1. Perform a ground check of the IFF/SIF before takeoff, using either the self-test or ground
     radar interrogation.
        6.29.1.1. If self-test is unacceptable and radar facilities do not permit a ground check, takeoff is
        authorized if the IFF/SIF was operational on the previous mission. Accomplish an airborne check
        immediately after takeoff.
        6.29.1.2. Aircraft will not depart with an IFF/SIF known to be inoperative. Exception: Single air-
        craft must have approval of ATC and aircraft commander.
     6.29.2. Use the IFF/SIF IAW Figure 6.4.
        6.29.2.1. IFF/SIF mode 1, 2, and 3/A codes, once set and transmitted, are unclassified and may be
        left in the transponder.
        6.29.2.2. IFF/SIF mode 4 codes must be zeroed before leaving the aircraft.
     6.29.3. An operational mode 4 is required. An operational check of the mode 4 will be made prior to
     takeoff (test equipment permitting). If the mode 4 checks bad or fails inflight, the IFF/SIF unit will
     be repaired prior to flight and/or aircraft landed for repairs except for the following:
        6.29.3.1. Missions that are generated in the CONUS and do not plan to exit the CONUS ADIZ.
        6.29.3.2. Non-training peacetime missions where cancellation or RTB for mode 4 failure would
        seriously degrade effectiveness (i.e. Presidential support, disaster relief, aeromedical evacuation,
        etc.).
        6.29.3.3. Mission where the aircraft will not transit in an area where safe passage procedures are
        implemented.
     6.29.4. Ground and inflight checks of the mode 4 are mandatory maintenance debrief items. Crews
     will annotate any failure or unsuccessful interrogation of the mode 4.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                           39

  1. Mode 4 is not required within the boundaries of the 48 contiguous states unless ADIZ penetra-
     tion is anticipated.
  2. Carry a keyer for use in the event of rerouting or diversion, except on local training missions.

6.30. Cargo Documentation:
    6.30.1. Proper cargo documentation will accompany each load. The cargo manifest and DD Form
    1384, Transportation Control and Movement Document (TCMD) and special handling documents as
    applicable, will be delivered to the aircraft before departure. The manifest will be one of the follow-
    ing:
       6.30.1.1. Computer printed product.
       6.30.1.2. 80/80 (Off-line Manifest) listing.
       6.30.1.3. DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest.
    6.30.2. DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, will accompany the manifest if required.
    6.30.3. Special handling documents, DD Form 1387-2, Special Handling Data/Certification, and AF
    Form 127, Traffic Transfer Receipt, will accompany the manifest as applicable.

6.31. Dropped Object Prevention. During aircraft exterior visual inspections, pay particular attention to
surfaces, panels, and components which could potentially be dropped objects. If a dropped object is dis-
covered and the mission is continued, the flight crew will:
    6.31.1. Ensure the write-up is entered in the appropriate maintenance forms.
    6.31.2. Notify the unit DO, unit safety officer, group command center as soon as practical. Include
    route of flight, altitude, and weather (i.e., turbulence, etc.).
40                                                                    AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

6.32. Narcotics. Crewmembers will ensure narcotics and other unauthorized items are not smuggled on
board the aircraft.

6.33. Cockpit Congestion/Loose Objects:
     6.33.1. Hold the number of persons on the flight deck to the minimum commensurate with mission
     requirements.
     6.33.2. Keep the flight deck area uncluttered and orderly for all flight and ground operations. Specif-
     ically:
        6.33.2.1. Do not place any item (checklist, chart, etc.) on the center pedestal in a position that
        covers or hides from view any switch, light, or gauge.
        6.33.2.2. Do not store on the flight deck any items not required for use or immediate reference
        inflight.

6.34. Passenger Policy. DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility establishes criteria for passenger
movement on DoD aircraft. It defines five categories of passenger travel: space-available, aeromedical
evacuation, orientation, public affairs, and space-required. AFI 11-401, Flight Management, provides fur-
ther guidance on orientation and public affairs travel. Refer to these publications directly for details not
addressed in this instruction. In all cases, passengers will be manifested on a DD Form 96, Passenger
Manifest. Refer to paragraph 3.3. for ACM policy.
     6.34.1. Space-available. Allows authorized passengers to occupy seats on DoD aircraft after all
     space-required passengers have been accommodated. Required documentation is listed in DoD
     4515.13-R. Passengers process through the passenger terminal. EC-137 aircraft may be used for r
     space-available travel on a non- interference basis with unit DO approval.
     6.34.2. Aeromedical Evacuation. Defined as the movement of patients by air. Specific guidance on
     eligibility and documentation is contained in DoD 4515.13-R. USCINCTRANSCOM is the single
     manager for policy and procedure.
        6.34.2.1. Restrictions. If tasked to conduct aeromedical evacuation, both pilots must be fully
        qualified. Air refueling may be performed if required for mission accomplishment after coordina-
        tion with tasking authority. Simulated EPs are prohibited.
     6.34.3. Orientation. AFI 11-401, Flight Management, contains specific details on the Air Force Ori-
     entation Flight Program. There are four categories of orientation flight: incentive flights, distin-
     guished visitor flights, familiarization flights, and spouse orientation flights. Authorized participants
     and approval authority are contained in AFI 11-401, Table 1.1. Document authorization by letter and
     manifest on DD Form 96. Requests for approval will include the mission profile and mission events to
     be accomplished. Forward requests through stan/eval channels. Report annual orientation activity
     IAW AFI 11-401 and applicable supplements.
        6.34.3.1. Restrictions.
            6.34.3.1.1. For spouse orientation, comply with restrictions in AFI 11-401 and applicable sup-
            plements.
            6.34.3.1.2. For other orientation categories, both pilots must be fully qualified. Group CC or
            COMAFSOF may approve air refueling on a case by case basis. Simulated EPs are prohibited.

         All other mission events may be conducted IAW the profile approved by approval authority
         listed in AFI 11-401, Table 1.1.
  6.34.4. Public Affairs Travel. Defined as travel in the interest of adding to the public understanding of
  DoD activities. AFI 11-401, Flight Management, contains specific details on the Air Force Public
  Affairs Flight Program. Authorized participants and approval authority are contained in AFI 11-401,
  Table 1.1. Document authorization by letter and manifest on DD Form 96. Requests for approval will
  include the mission profile and mission events to be accomplished. Forward requests through public
  affairs channels.
     6.34.4.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified. Group CC or COMAFSOF may
     approve air refueling on a case by case basis. Simulated EPs are prohibited. All other mission
     events may be conducted as approved by approval authority. Passengers will be seated with belts
     fastened during threat maneuvers.
  6.34.5. Space-required. DoD 4515.13-R lists several categories of passengers, not previously men-
  tioned, who are authorized official travel on DoD aircraft.
     6.34.5.1. Supported forces. A sub-category of space-required passenger defined by this instruc-
     tion as US and foreign military personnel who are an integral part of the mission being performed.
     Approval is assumed by the mission tasking. Supported forces passengers must be properly mani-
     fested.
         6.34.5.1.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI 11-401,
         paragraph 1.12 (Requirements for Pilots in Dual-Controlled Aircraft). Simulated EPs are pro-
         hibited. There are no restrictions on mission events. Aircraft commanders will ensure that
         supported forces are briefed on the mission profile and mission events before flight.
     6.34.5.2. Supporting forces. A sub-category of space-required passenger defined by this instruc-
     tion as US and foreign military, DoD civilians, and US civilian employees under contract to the
     DoD, who directly support the mission or a deployment of an AFSOC unit. This may include, but
     is not limited to; maintenance, communications, intelligence, logistics, and flight test personnel,
     civilian contractors required for inflight checks or deployment support, FAA representatives, STS,
     and other military personnel who are on board to communicate/coordinate with other agencies.
     Off-station travel is documented by travel orders. Local flights will be documented by letter of
     authorization from the Group CC or COMAFSOF (Exception: Squadron Commanders may
     approve squadron assigned personnel). When frequent local flights are necessary, commanders
     may issue annual authorizations by name or AFSC as appropriate. When using this option, aircraft
     commanders will ensure that all restrictions in the following paragraph are complied with for each
     individual mission. Supporting forces must be properly manifested.
         6.34.5.2.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI 11-401,
         paragraph 1.12 (Requirements for Pilots in Dual-Controlled Aircraft). Simulated EPs are pro-
         hibited (Exception: EPs required for the purposes of a functional check flight or FAA flight
         evaluation are authorized. In this context, personnel on board are required for mission accom-
         plishment. Limit personnel to absolute minimum required). Other mission events are autho-
         rized. Aircraft commanders will ensure that supporting forces are briefed on the mission
         profile and mission events before flight. EC-137D maintenance personnel travel as supporting
         forces but do not require FAs.
42                                                                   AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

6.35. Military Customs Preclearance Inspection Program:
     6.35.1. The military customs program (DOD 5030.49R and AFI 24-401/402/403/404) was developed
     to assist the DOD and other US Government agencies in the control of narcotics, contraband, and pro-
     hibited agricultural products, and to expedite entry of DOD personnel and material into the customs
     territory of the United States.
     6.35.2. Military Customs Inspectors will accomplish this inspection immediately prior to departure
     and may conduct more than one preclearance inspection on CONUS bound aircraft. When security
     considerations necessitate deviation from this policy, mission planners must coordinate with the
     appropriate agency to ensure the mission is not jeopardized.

Section 6F—Departure

6.36. Checklists. Accomplish all checklists with strict discipline. A checklist is not complete until all
items are accomplished.
     6.36.1. The pilot flying the aircraft will initiate all checklists unless the operations manual or this
     instruction establishes another procedure.
     6.36.2. The only pages (or inserts) authorized in checklist binders are EC-137D-series TO aircrew
     checklists, AFSOC approved checklists, briefing guides, and approved information guides. Units
     may construct locally approved inflight guides using AFSOC Form 54, AFSOC Flight Crew Informa-
     tion.
     6.36.3. Make personal notes in pencil on checklists and briefing or information guides, if desired.
     Such notes must be current.
     6.36.4. Abbreviated checklist items that do not apply to unit aircraft or mission may be lined out in
     pencil. Do not challenge these items during checklist accomplishment.
     6.36.5. The flight engineer will read all checklists that apply to specific employment procedures.

6.37. Flight Deck Entry:
     6.37.1. The following personnel are authorized to sit on the flight deck during takeoff, landing, and
     critical phases of flight.
        6.37.1.1. Additional crewmembers (ACM) if seats are not required by primary crewmembers or
        flight examiners.
        6.37.1.2. AFSOC mission observers.
        6.37.1.3. Individuals approved by the mission commander. If no mission commander is required,
        the aircraft commander is the approval authority.
     6.37.2. Passenger access to any primary crew position is prohibited.

6.38. TOLD Cards. The flight engineer will complete TOLD cards IAW this instruction, Volume 2 and
the Operations Manual.

6.39. Departure Briefing. The pilot making the takeoff will brief the crew IAW the operations manual.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                                43

6.40. On-Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are considered "on time" if the aircraft is airborne no later
than 0.2 hours after the scheduled takeoff time. Early departures are authorized provided local, down-
range, and aircrew impact are evaluated and no adverse effect will result.

6.41. Departure Monitoring. The pilot not flying the aircraft will back up the pilot and report any devi-
ations from the planned departure. When radar facilities are available, departures will be radar monitored
to the maximum extent possible.

Section 6G—Enroute

6.42. Oxygen Requirements. Aircrew members will comply with the oxygen requirements specified in
AFI 11-202 Volume 3.
   6.42.1. Crewmembers occupying a crew station on the flight deck will have an oxygen mask con-
   nected and readily available for use before engine start and until engine shutdown. Prior to flight,
   crewmembers will accomplish a communications and operations check of their oxygen masks.
   6.42.2. All crewmembers will use supplemental oxygen for flight when the cabin altitude exceeds
   10,000 feet MSL. Walk-around bottles do not satisfy this requirement. When oxygen is not available
   to other non-crewmembers, flight between 10,000 - 13,000 feet MSL is authorized for a maximum of
   3 hours, if required.
       6.42.2.1. For flights at cabin altitudes between 10,000 and 18,000, 100 percent will be used. No
       prebreathing is required. Hydration is an important part of preventing decompression sickness
       and as such it is permissible to be off oxygen for up to 10 seconds to drink. If necessary,
       walkaround bottles may be used for personal relief.
   6.42.3. Crewmembers who do not have access to the aircraft oxygen system will have a passenger
   oxygen kit (POK) readily available for pressurized flights above FL 250. Prior to flight, visually
   inspect the POK to ensure it contains an adequate supply of oxygen.

6.43. Flight Progress. Use all available navigational aids to maintain course centerline and positive fix-
ing of the aircraft’s position. Immediately report to the controlling ARTCC any malfunction or loss of
navigation capability which degrades centerline accuracy.

6.44. Navigation Aid Capability:
   6.44.1. North Atlantic Region and the US West Coast/Hawaii Route System. Aircraft must have an
   operable INS/GPS prior to airspace/track entry. Aircraft without this equipment must return to a sta-
   tion with maintenance capability or refile via routes specified in FLIP.
   6.44.2. North Pacific (NOPAC) Region. Comply with the following procedures when transiting the
   Anchorage/Tokyo Oceanic CTA/FIRs on the NOPAC north route:
       6.44.2.1. Westbound aircraft on the NOPAC north route experiencing loss of radar capability at
       any point shall, fuel permitting, refile a flight plan on another track or return to the nearest facility
       with radar maintenance capability.
       6.44.2.2. Westbound aircraft on the NOPAC north route that have a single drift and groundspeed
       source and experience loss of that source at any point, may continue the NOPAC north route if the
       radar system is fully operable. Verify in flight that satisfactory returns are being received on all
44                                                                    AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

        ranges, particularly the longer ranges (100 NM or greater). If the radar system is marginal or inop-
        erative, fuel permitting, refile a flight plan to another track or return to the nearest facility with
        maintenance capability.

6.45. CIRVIS (AFM 10-206) and Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft
as indicated in the FLIP Planning or Flight Information Handbook (FIH).

6.46. Inflight Meals. The aircraft commander and the copilot will not consume meals within 90 min-
utes of each other, before or during flight, if the meals were procured from the same vendor and consist of
the same menu.

6.47. Communications. Make all communications IAW FLIP or as directed by the controlling agency.

6.48. Inflight Emergency Procedures. Report deviations from directives that occur as a result of an
emergency, IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 3 and this instruction.
     6.48.1. Notification of Controlling Agencies. As soon as practical after completing the aircraft emer-
     gency action checklist, furnish the controlling agency and appropriate CCC a description and extent of
     the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any further pertinent information.
     6.48.2. Emergency Landing. Aircrews must be prepared to divert to the nearest suitable airfield.
     6.48.3. Turnaround Procedures. When a turnaround is necessary, use procedures in FLIP. Maintain
     VFR, reverse course, climb or descend to a VFR altitude or flight level and request ATC clearance. If
     unable to maintain VFR, obtain an ATC clearance before reversing course. A turnaround under IFR
     conditions, without ATC approval, will be made only after a thorough evaluation of the seriousness of
     the emergency, general traffic density, and known traffic operating in the immediate area. Normally,
     a climb or descent (with minimum change in altitude) to a VFR altitude or flight level will result in
     minimum exposure to other aircraft, if a turnaround is required.

6.49. Continued Flight with Engine Loss. A flight may proceed on 3 engines to its destination if
2-engine capability exists, favorable operating conditions prevail both en route and at the point of
intended landing, and a suitable alternate airfield is available at all times. If these conditions cannot be
met, the flight will terminate at the nearest facility (preferably military) which, in the judgment of the air-
craft commander, offers safe and favorable operating conditions.

6.50. Fuel Jettisoning. Fuel will not be jettisoned except for emergency conditions requiring gross
weight reduction.

6.51. Medical Assistance. When a person on board the aircraft requires medical care, the aircraft com-
mander will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical personnel may meet
the aircraft. The request will include the individual’s sex, approximate age, and the nature of the medical
problem.

6.52. Weather Forecasts:
     6.52.1. The primary contact for inflight weather assistance is the Pilot Meteorological Service
     (PMSV).
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                             45

   6.52.2. For aircraft flying into Europe, the preferred alternate contact for weather information east of
   10 degrees west longitude is through Croughton USAF Global Command and Control Station
   (GCCS) to USAFE Weather Support Unit at Ramstein (USAFE Metro).
   6.52.3. For aircraft flying into the Pacific theater, the preferred alternate contact for weather informa-
   tion west of 140 degrees west longitude is through the USAF GCCS to Hickam AFB, HI.
   6.52.4. When operating outside the CONUS, monitor GCCS weather broadcasts. Times and frequen-
   cies are contained in the FLIP Flight Information Handbook. During contingency operations or exer-
   cises, use GCCS weather broadcasts to support silent ocean crossings.
   6.52.5. Obtain latest weather prior to descent for landing at destination.

Section 6H—Arrival

6.53. Crew Coordination. The pilot flying the approach will brief the crew on the descent, approach,
and landing IAW the operations manual. The other pilot will monitor the approach and report any devia-
tions from prescribed procedures. Crewmembers will confine their activities to aircraft operation,
descent and approach monitoring, and checklist accomplishment from the initial descent point to block in.
Under no circumstances will crewmembers deviate from these duties, except for inflight emergencies.

6.54. Instrument Approach Minimums. Comply with guidance in AFI 11-202 Volume 3 Chapter 8.
The EC-137D is a category "D" aircraft. Instrument approach visibility and, if required, ceiling mini-
mums, will be as published, with the following exceptions:

6.55. Weather Below Minimums. See AFI 11-202 Volume 3 Chapter 8 and AFSOC SUP.
   6.55.1. An aircraft commander may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but fore-
   cast to improve to, or above minimums, provided:
       6.55.1.1. Fuel remaining is more than the fuel required to hold for the appropriate holding time
       and fly to the alternate, and weather for the alternate is forecast to remain at or above alternate
       minimums for the period, including holding time.
       6.55.1.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before the excess fuel will
       be consumed.
   6.55.2. When advised after beginning the descent to the final approach fix that weather conditions are
   below landing minimums, and a new or amended clearance has not been received, comply with AFI
   11-202 Volume 3. The aircraft commander may elect to continue the approach.

6.56. Instrument Approach Procedures:
   6.56.1. Fly instrument approaches to maintain proficiency and to positively identify arrival airports.
   Visual approaches are authorized to maintain visual landing proficiency. Use radar monitoring when
   feasible.
   6.56.2. Fly a precision approach, if available, at night and during marginal weather. If PAR and ILS
   are available, fly one and use the other as a backup. Request PAR if prior notification is required. If
   PAR or ILS are not available, fly any available approved instrument approach. On training and eval-
46                                                                    AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

     uation flights pilots may fly nonprecision approaches or VFR traffic patterns to accomplish required
     training or evaluation requirements.
     6.56.3. When a coupled approach is flown, assume manual control at or above published minimum
     altitude (MDA/DH). When accomplishing Flaps 25 approaches, assume manual control IAW the air-
     craft operations manual.
     6.56.4. The only approved published instrument approaches are from DoD and NOAA. All other
     approaches are considered published only after TERPS review and approval by AFSOC/DO. Submit
     requests for review to the theater MAJCOM TERPS office, then forward their recommendations to
     AFSOC/DOV for AFSOC/DO approval.
     6.56.5. If the minimum altitude is not adequately depicted on an instrument approach procedure chart
     and terrain clearance is not confirmed by ATC radar, continue to the initial approach fix at or above
     the minimum altitude depicted on the en route chart and complete the descent to the initial approach
     altitude in the holding pattern.

6.57. Radio Altimeter Procedures. Set the radio altimeters to the HAT or HAA for the approach being
flown in accordance with the operations manual. Pilots will crosscheck radio altimeters during descent to
ensure adequate terrain clearance is provided throughout the descent and maneuvering portion of the
approach. Once established in a VFR traffic pattern, the radio altimeter may be set at the discretion of the
pilot.

6.58. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Pilots must exercise the discipline necessary to ensure wake turbu-
lence avoidance criteria are observed during flight operations. Acceptance of a visual or contact
approach clearance, or instructions to follow an aircraft, is acknowledgment that the pilot will maintain a
safe interval for wake turbulence avoidance. Pilots will comply with guidance in DOD FLIP planning.

Section 6I—Postflight

6.59. Classified Material:
     6.59.1. Maintain authenticators and other classified materials in the aircraft safe.
     6.59.2. Remove classified information stored in the GPS, INS, or mission computers.
     6.59.3. Clear all TRANSEC systems, such as secure voice and IFF.
     6.59.4. In an emergency, destroy or damage classified material and equipment prior to crash landing,
     if possible.

6.60. Impoundment. If an aircraft is involved in a serious inflight incident, the aircraft commander
should impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the AFSOC Command Center or con-
trolling agency for further instructions.

Section 6J—Debriefing

6.61. Maintenance. The aircraft commander and the flight engineer complete the appropriate mainte-
nance forms. Immediately after arrival, the aircraft commander and other pertinent crewmembers debrief
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                            47

maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics equipment, and all installed spe-
cial equipment.

6.62. Weather. The aircraft commander or a representative will pass significant information to the
appropriate weather agency.

6.63. Intelligence. Debrief intelligence when applicable.

6.64. Crew Debriefing. The aircraft commander will conduct a debriefing after each mission. The
debriefing will include all applicable crewmembers so that common problems can be discussed and
resolved. Crewmembers may be excused from the debrief at the discretion of the aircraft commander.
Debriefings may be formal or informal, as the situation requires. The appropriate forms will be com-
pleted and procedures will be established to ensure the commander or operations officer reviews the
forms as soon as practical after mission accomplishment.

6.65. Aircrew Notification Procedures. When transiting installations, the aircraft commander will
establish a point of contact with the command post, base operations, or local airport manager, when the
crew is billeted in off base quarters. The aircraft commander will be notified immediately in case of inci-
dent or emergency affecting the safety or security of the aircraft.

Section 6K—MiscellaneousProcedures

6.66. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture Inspections:
   6.66.1. Obtain Customs, Agriculture, and Public Health clearance, as required, prior to opening any
   doors, hatches, or windows, other than the left forward entry door, or enplaning and deplaning person-
   nel.
   6.66.2. Proceed directly from the aircraft to Customs, Immigration, or Agricultural inspection for
   processing when required by the inspector.
   6.66.3. US military aircraft are sovereign. When cleared to overfly or land in foreign territory, it is
   US policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges and immunities which customar-
   ily are accorded warships. These privileges and immunities include, in the absence of stipulations to
   the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation; immunity from search, seizure, and inspections
   (including customs and safety inspections); or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the
   aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo on board. USAF aircraft commanders will not authorize
   search, seizure, inspection, or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authori-
   ties except by direction of HQ USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned.
       6.66.3.1. Aircraft commanders will not permit the inspection of their aircraft by officials of any
       foreign government. If requested to do so, the aircraft commander and crew will deny access and
       seek aid from the senior AFSOC or other USAF representative, US Embassy, or consulate within
       the host nation. Customs or other officials will be informed of the above policy and requested to
       confirm their request through their own government and with US Department of State representa-
       tives. If necessary, the crew will seal the aircraft and the crew entered into crew rest, departure
       intentions will be canceled, until resolution of the matter by appropriate authority. Inform com-
       mand and control authorities by the fastest available means should this situation occur.
48                                                                  AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

        6.66.3.2. When confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should consider
        the following procedures:
           6.66.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement of aircraft com-
           manders to the foreign officials that the aircraft is sovereign and not subject to search without
           consent of HQ USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned. This should be clearly
           conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities who may honestly, but mis-
           takenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft.
           6.66.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, aircraft commanders must
           negotiate to delay the search until contact is made with HQ USAF/XOXXI or the appropriate
           embassy. Aircraft commanders should unequivocally state that they have no authority to con-
           sent to the search and that they must relay the foreign request to these agencies for decision.
           Aircraft commanders should then notify these agencies of the foreign request by the most
           expeditious means available. Thereafter, aircraft commanders should follow instructions pro-
           vided by the appropriate embassy and HQ USAF.
           6.66.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, aircraft commanders
           should indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and mechan-
           ical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so.
           6.66.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way on
           board an aircraft, aircraft commanders should state that they protest the course of action being
           pursued and that they intend to notify both the appropriate American Embassy and HQ USAF
           of the foreign action. Aircraft commanders should then allow the foreign agents on board the
           aircraft, without physical resistance, and thereafter report the incident to HQ USAF and appro-
           priate embassy as soon as possible.
           6.66.3.2.5. In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo or
           equipment. These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to the for-
           eign clearance guide should be followed where applicable.

6.67. Border Clearance:
     6.67.1. Normal Operations:
        6.67.1.1. Border Clearance Responsibility. The border clearance responsibility will be as desig-
        nated by the base or area command IAW AFI 24-401, Custom-Europe: AFI 24-402, Cus-
        toms-Pacific; AFI 24-403, Customs-Southern; and AFI 24-404, Customs-Domestic; Border
        Clearance;, Customs Program; and other United States Entry Requirements and Related Areas.
        6.67.1.2. Aircraft Commander Responsibility. Border clearance is the responsibility of the air-
        craft commander, although many of the duties have been assigned to ground personnel and to the
        FA. The aircraft commander will ensure:
           6.67.1.2.1. Crewmembers and passengers possess current passports and valid visas if
           required.
           6.67.1.2.2. Crewmembers and passengers have current shot records or certificates of immuni-
           zation.
           6.67.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                         49

         6.67.1.2.4. Departure or arrival to the US is through an air base where border clearance can be
         obtained.
         6.67.1.2.5. Border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and baggage, if required, is
         obtained before takeoff to a foreign area, or after arrival from a foreign area.
         6.67.1.2.6. Aircraft spraying is accomplished, if required (see paragraph 6.68.).
         6.67.1.2.7. En route to the US, the FA has distributed personal customs declarations to all pas-
         sengers and crewmembers; has briefed passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations;
         and has prepared and compiled necessary border clearance forms for the aircraft commander’s
         signature.
         6.67.1.2.8. En route to the US, the base of intended landing is notified of any change in ETA,
         to ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
         6.67.1.2.9. A Permit to Proceed is obtained when the mission requires an aircraft, which has
         landed in the US for customs clearance, proceed to another US base to obtain border clearance.
         The permit delays customs inspection of cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the off-
         load station, saving intermediate offloading and reloading normally required for customs
         inspection. The Permit to Proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing, where the border
         clearance must be completed, or a new permit obtained. Do not make intermediate stops
         unless required by an emergency situation, or directed by AFSOC.
         6.67.1.2.10. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
         normally meets the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane passengers or
         crewmembers, unless necessary for safety. Do not unload until approved by customs and agri-
         culture personnel or their designated representatives. This procedure applies to the initial
         landing in the US and all subsequent landings until crew, passengers, and cargo complete final
         border clearance.
  6.67.2. Exercise and Contingency Operations:
     6.67.2.1. General. Certain missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or exit, require
     special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health, immigration, and agricul-
     tural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding establishes procedures and waivers.
     6.67.2.2. Implementation. Traffic and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agree-
     ment as necessary for each operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the
     CONUS onload or offload base instead of the normal APOE, or at the foreign onload or offload
     base.
     6.67.2.3. Customs Procedures:
         6.67.2.3.1. Outbound. No requirement. Filing of CF Form 7507, General Declaration (Out-
         ward/Inward) is waived.
         6.67.2.3.2. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival.
            6.67.2.3.2.1. CF 7507, General Declaration, (passenger list not required).

                   6.67.2.3.2.3.2. One copy of DD Form 1854, US Customs Baggage Declaration, for
                   each passenger not under command of the troop commander, to include observers, sup-
                   port personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
                   6.67.2.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a Customs representative
                   meets the aircraft and accepts the troop commander’s certificate with respect to troop
                   baggage. Individual baggage declarations are not required. The troop commander
                   should have inspected troop baggage. Troops debark under the observation of the Cus-
                   toms representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The Customs
                   officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
                6.67.2.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:
                   6.67.2.3.2.4.1. One copy of DD Form 1854, US Customs Baggage Declaration, for
                   each passenger. This includes observers, support personnel, civilians, news media per-
                   sonnel, and crewmembers. Personnel may use DD Form 1854 or CF 6059B when
                   issued by the US Customs representative.
                   6.67.2.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a Customs representative
                   meets the aircraft and collects all declarations. Troops debark under the observation of
                   the Customs representative, who may make discretionary examination of the baggage.
        6.67.2.4. Public Health Procedures:
            6.67.2.4.1. The aircraft commander ensures that all crewmembers and passengers are prop-
            erly immunized.
            6.67.2.4.2. Spray the aircraft, if required (see paragraph 6.68.).
        6.67.2.5. Immigration Procedures:
            6.67.2.5.1. Outbound. No requirements.
            6.67.2.5.2. Inbound. Submit the following to the Immigration inspector:

                national.

6.68. Insect and Pest Control (Aircraft Spraying):
     6.68.1. Aircraft commanders will ensure required spraying is accomplished when required by the for-
     eign clearance guide, and certify the spraying on CF 7507, or on forms provided by the country tran-
     sited.
     6.68.2. Use insecticide, Aerosol D-Phenotrin-2%, NSN 6840-1-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray
     the aircraft.
        6.68.2.1. Aerosol normally is dispersed at a flow rate of 10 seconds per 1,000 cubic feet. Direct
        the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being sprayed. Do not spray any plastic
        surface or allow the spray to wet it.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                              51

       6.68.2.2. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the aircraft after clos-
       ing all doors, windows, hatches, and ventilation openings. Do not spray the aircraft with crew or
       passengers on board.
   6.68.3. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the aircraft inflight, notify the destination
   CCC, base operations, or airport manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can
   meet the aircraft.
   6.68.4. Upon arrival, do not open doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the
   aircraft for insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload until the inspection is satisfactorily
   completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local requirements, as arranged by the
   base air terminal manager.

6.69. Sensitive Mission Operations:
   6.69.1. Certain missions require special flight planning procedures or deceptive measures. Use of
   these procedures will be directed by mission operating directives, COMAFSOC operations orders, or
   other tasking orders. Modification to normal procedures will be fully briefed to aircrews prior to exe-
   cution of the operation. COMAFSOC or the COMAFSOF prior to execution must approve all mis-
   sions of this type requiring coordination with non-AFSOC agencies.
   6.69.2. The planning agency tasked with the mission will provide the aircrew with the following
   information:
       6.69.2.1. Departure profile.
       6.69.2.2. En route procedures to include tracks, ALTRV, MARSA, tanker rendezvous, and emer-
       gency divert procedures.
       6.69.2.3. Arrival procedures.
       6.69.2.4. All communication requirements.

6.70. "Due Regard" Procedures. When a unit commander authorizes a mission to be flown in interna-
tional airspace and inflight operational requirements conflict with ICAO rules and procedures, the aircraft
commander may make the decision to proceed using "due regard" procedures.

6.71. Hazardous Medical Equipment:
   6.71.1. Nonstandard equipment possessed by medical facilities, which use AFSOC air evacuation
   services should be regarded as potentially hazardous. Two types of equipment are of major concern:
       6.71.1.1. Electronic medical equipment produces electromagnetic interference (EMI) which is
       commonly beyond the limits specified by MILSTD461A and 462, and therefore can interfere with
       aircraft communication and navigational equipment.
       6.71.1.2. Therapeutic oxygen systems present an increased hazard of fire or explosion. A poten-
       tial but real hazard is the inadvertent disruption of the cylinder neck, manifold, or regulator result-
       ing in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories.
   6.71.2. Nonstandard electronic and oxygen equipment must be listed by manufacturer and model
   number in the current "Status Report on Medical Material Items Tested and Evaluated for use in the
   USAF Aeromedical Evacuation System, USAFSAM, Brooks AFB, TX."
52                                                                    AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

     6.71.3. For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions:
        6.71.3.1. Pararescue personnel must inform the aircraft commander when nonstandard electronic
        medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft.
        6.71.3.2. The AC must be informed of the anticipated period of use of the equipment during the
        mission.
        6.71.3.3. The AC must be alert for any interference with aircraft communication or navigation
        equipment during periods of use of this equipment.
        6.71.3.4. When continuous use of the equipment is required throughout the duration of the mis-
        sion, flight must be restricted to VFR conditions. Furthermore, exercise additional caution on
        night VFR missions to ensure there are no adverse effects on navigational equipment.
     6.71.4. For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions:
        6.71.4.1. All compressed oxygen equipment with exposed, unprotected cylinder neck, manifold,
        or regulator must be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal and lateral axes.
        6.71.4.2. Pararescue personnel must continually monitor the operation of the equipment to detect
        possible malfunction during exposure to altitude.

6.72. Hazardous Material Procedures. The term "hazardous material" (reference AFJI 11-204)
includes any material which, because of its quantity, properties, or packaging, may endanger human life
or property. Procedures in this paragraph apply whenever aircraft carry DOD Hazard Class/Division 1.1,
1.2, or 1.3 explosives, DOT Class A and B poisons, etiological or biological research materials, radioac-
tive materials requiring yellow III labels, and inert devices. Also included are DOD Hazard Class/Divi-
sion 1.4 explosives, oxidizers, compressed gases, flammable solids and liquids, and corrosive liquids
listed in AFJMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials For Military Air Shipments.
     6.72.1. Briefing. Reference AFMAN 24-204.
     6.72.2. Cargo Documentation. Do not accept hazardous materials unless proper documentation, cer-
     tification, and identification of cargo are provided. This includes transportation control number
     (TCN) entered correctly on both the cargo manifest and the DD Form 1387-2, Special Handling Data/
     Certification.
     6.72.3. Flight Planning. The aircraft commander (unless specifically briefed otherwise):
        6.72.3.1. Enters "Hazardous Cargo" and the mission number in the appropriate section of the
        flight plan. Use remarks section of DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, and other information sec-
        tion of DD Form 1801, DOD International Flight Plan, and ICAO Flight Plan Form.
        6.72.3.2. Plans the flight to minimize overflying heavily populated or otherwise critical areas.
        6.72.3.3. Prepares a departure message. The remarks section of the departure message should
        include the following:
            6.72.3.3.1. DOT class and DOD hazard class or division, if applicable, of hazardous material
            on board. (Include net weight of DOT Class A or B poisons and net explosive weight [NEW]
            of Class A or B explosives).
            6.72.3.3.2. Request for special support; e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams,
            etc.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                         53

         6.72.3.3.3. Inert devices (when applicable).
     6.72.3.4. If ETE is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances preclude timely receipt at destina-
     tion, notify base operations at the first intended landing, by priority telephone, of the ETA and
     information listed in 6.74.3.3. above.
  6.72.4. Before Engine Start. Ensure placards are removed. Give the controlling agency parking loca-
  tion, approximate engine start time, and verify that the fire fighting agency has the hazardous materi-
  als information. If not, request the following be relayed to the fire fighting agency:
     6.72.4.1. DOT class of hazardous material on board and the DOD hazard class or division for
     explosive material on board.
     6.72.4.2. Net Explosive Weight (NEW).
     6.72.4.3. Request for isolated taxiing (if necessary).
     6.72.4.4. Estimated time of departure (ETD).
  6.72.5. En Route. Normal procedures apply. Avoid flying over metropolitan or
  otherwise critical areas.
  6.72.6. Before Landing. Accomplish the following unless specifically prohibited by the theater com-
  mander or FLIP planning.
     6.72.6.1. Contact the base operations dispatcher, control tower, approach control, or other agency
     specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) before ETA to announce that hazard-
     ous materials are on board and to verify that the appropriate base support agencies have received
     the departure message. If not, transmit the mission number, ETA, and information listed in
     6.72.3.3. above.
     6.72.6.2. If landing at a CONUS civil airport without a tower, give the above information to the
     nearest FAA flight service station.
     6.72.6.3. Request the information be relayed immediately to base operations or the civil airport
     manager, crash or fire protection agency, and other support activities.
  6.72.7. Parking:
     6.72.7.1. DOD requires aircraft carrying DOD Hazard Class or Division 1.1, 1.2, explosives,
     DOT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions be parked in areas isolated
     from personnel. Aircraft commanders are responsible for ensuring cargo is correctly identified to
     the tower and ground control. When aircraft are not directed to an isolated area, identify the cargo
     again to tower or ground control. When identification is acknowledged, the host is solely respon-
     sible for selecting the parking area. Should host procedures be questionable, submit trip reports or
     HRs, as appropriate, to document such occurrences.
     6.72.7.2. The military host is responsible for placarding aircraft. For non-military installations,
     the briefing to the aircraft commander will include placarding requirements and, if required, plac-
     ards will be furnished at the onload base. The shipper must make prior arrangements with the air-
     port manager for shipments of hazardous materials requiring placarding. The shipper is
     responsible for cargo identification, fire-fighting procedures, and isolated parking requirements.
54                                                                   AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

     6.72.8. Unscheduled Landing Due to Inflight Emergency. Transmit unclassified information to the
     appropriate air traffic control facility as follows:
        6.72.8.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
        6.72.8.2. Aircraft position and ETA.
        6.72.8.3. Number of personnel and location in aircraft.
        6.72.8.4. Fuel on board.
        6.72.8.5. That hazardous materials are on board, location of the cargo, and applicable information
        listed in 6.72.3.3. above.
     6.72.9. After Unscheduled Landing. Contact the AFSOC Command Center or theater ALCC by tele-
     phone, HF radio, or message, giving arrival notice, hazardous materials’ information, and other perti-
     nent information as required.

6.73. Electronic Devices. The use of electronic devices is as specified in AFI 11-202 Volume 3 Chapter
2. For electronic devices not listed, the user will provide the aircrew a letter from the Aeronautical Sys-
tems Division, Deputy for Engineering (ASD/ENACE) certifying the device is approved for airborne use.
If the aircrew detects any interference from an electronic device used on board the aircraft, the use of this
device will be discontinued for the duration of the flight.
     6.73.1. Restrictions and cautions regarding the use of electronic devices must be a standard part of
     passenger briefings aboard all DOD transport aircraft
     6.73.2. Wing or group commander, or COMAFSOF, may waive the provisions of AFI 11-202 Volume
     3 for news media video and recording equipment providing the following conditions are met:
        6.73.2.1. If the equipment has been tested, certified interference free, and been so labeled by
        ASD/ENACE.
        6.73.2.2. If the equipment has not been tested, use is restricted to VMC.

6.74. Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT). SARSAT is an international satellite
system for Search and Rescue (SAR). It consists of a constellation of six satellites in polar orbit and a net-
work of earth stations which provide distress alert and location information to appropriate rescue authori-
ties anywhere in the world for users in distress.
     6.74.1. Ground Segment. The SARSAT ground segment consists of Local User Terminals (LUTs)
     which receive and process alert data information from the satellites, compute the position of the dis-
     tress signal and relay the information to one of thirteen Mission Control Centers (MCC). The MCC in
     turn distributes the information to the appropriate Rescue Coordination Center (RCC), a search and
     rescue point of contact, or another MCC. The MCC reports all SARSAT alert data to the appropriate
     SAR authority. The SARSAT satellites detect beacons broadcasting on 121.5, 243.0, and 406.025
     MHz.
     6.74.2. Frequencies. SARSAT is divided into two systems to detect emergency beacons. The first
     system broadcasts on the 121.5/243.0 MHz frequencies and works with Emergency Locator Transmit-
     ters (ELTs) and Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) at those frequencies. This
     system is limited to a circular area within a 2,000 mile radius of a ground station. The second system
     on the 406.025 MHz frequency provides monitoring for the entire earth. An analog signal is emitted
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                            55

   from the 121.5/243.0 MHz beacon, and a digital signal is transmitted from a 406.025 MHz beacon. In
   areas without LUT coverage, signals from 121.5/243.0 MHz beacons cannot be received. However,
   this is not the case with the 406.025 MHz system, as the satellites have a memory unit which stores the
   signals for relay to the next available LUT, giving it a truly global capability.
   6.74.3. Local User Terminals (LUTs). The current SARSAT system consists of 25 LUTs in 14 coun-
   tries, including 4 in the United States. Although 121.5/243.0 MHz LUT coverage is nearly world-
   wide, much of the southern hemisphere, including most of the African continent, is not covered.
   During contingencies in those areas, mission planners should be aware that the RCC at Langley AFB
   maintains two LUTs which may be deployed. The deployable unit is a camper-sized van and antenna
   trailer designed for transport worldwide aboard cargo aircraft.

6.75. Inappropriate Charges. IAW the DOD Foreign Clearance Guide, Europe, Forward 3, Section I
(Aircraft Entrance Requirements) aircrews should not pay inappropriate charges. Inappropriate charges
include landing and parking at government airports and air navigation or overflight fees. Aircrews, when
asked to pay inappropriate charges, should do the following:
   6.75.1. Advise local host nation authorities (e.g. airport officials) that the above charges are inappro-
   priate for US Government aircraft and the aircrew cannot pay these bills.
   6.75.2. Contact the USDAO/American Embassy representative at the airport or at the American
   Embassy, if possible (NOTE: At remote locations, this contact may not be feasible). Follow guidance
   provided by USDAO/American Embassy personnel.
   6.75.3. In absence of USDAO/American Embassy guidance, and if local authorities state that pay-
   ment is a condition of departure, aircrews should do the following:
       6.75.3.1. Mark inappropriate charges on bill as invalid fees.
       6.75.3.2. Annotate bill with the remark: "PAID UNDER PROTEST."
       6.75.3.3. Aircrews should obtain a copy of the bill with the signature of the person accepting
       moneys and note the amount paid.
       6.75.3.4. Retain signed copy of bill for home station finance office.
56                                                                  AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

                                                Chapter 7

                                        AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and unlawful seizure (hijacking) of
AFSOC aircraft. Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist an aircraft hijacking. Resistance
may vary from dissuasion to direct physical confrontation, including the use of weapons. Aircrews will
not release information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members to the public.

7.2. Security. AFSOC aircraft are priority C resources. This security priority designation applies to
operational aircraft, wherever they may be located, worldwide. Some aircraft contain equipment and doc-
uments which require protection per DOD 5200.1/AFI 31-401, Managing The Information Security Pro-
gram. Requirements for protection of the aircraft in a transient status at US and foreign bases are found
in DOD 5200.1 and AFI 31-401.

7.3. Procedures. The planning agency must ensure that adequate en route security is available. Aircraft
commanders are best able to determine what protection is needed. The amount of protection required will
vary, depending on the location and ground time. Aircraft commanders will receive a threat assessment
and security capability evaluation briefing at home station, and receive updates at en route stops. Aircraft
commanders will assess the situation and take the following actions, if necessary:
     7.3.1. Area Patrol. Request area patrol coverage from local security forces. If local authorities
     request payment for this service, use AF Form l5, United States Air Force Invoice.
     7.3.2. Aircrew Surveillance. Direct armed crewmembers to remain with the aircraft and maintain
     surveillance over aircraft entrances and activities in the vicinity of the aircraft.
     7.3.3. Departure Without Crew Rest. If local security forces are unacceptable or unavailable, the air-
     craft commander may waive crew duty time limitations and depart as soon as possible for a base listed
     as reliable.
     7.3.4. Unauthorized Entry. If, in the aircraft commander’s judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked
     and sealed to detect unauthorized entry:
        7.3.4.1. Prior to departing the aircraft for crew rest, ensure the aircraft is closed and doors are
        sealed. Secure all hatches and doors. Close and seal the entrance door with a metal lock or other
        controllable device which will prevent and detect unauthorized entry.
        7.3.4.2. Wipe the immediate area around the lock clean to help investigate forced entry. If the
        lock is damaged or has been tampered with, notify the appropriate local authorities, the controlling
        agency, and inspect the aircraft thoroughly.
        7.3.4.3. Coordinate with the local base operations representative on procedures for servicing the
        aircraft while the crew is away. If a padlock is used, the key or combination will be left with base
        operations or the representative for personnel required to service or perform maintenance inside
        the aircraft.

7.4. Protective Standards for Aircraft Carrying Distinguished Visitors (DV). T h i s p a r a g r a p h
applies specifically to aircraft transporting DVs Code 4 or above. Aircraft commanders are responsible
for aircraft security at en route stops.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                             57

   7.4.1. DOD Installations. Notify the base security police of estimated arrival and departure times.
   Request continuous security surveillance during the entire ground time. If the installation is unable to
   comply, arrange for the best protection available.
   7.4.2. Non-DOD Installations. Contact the airport manager or installation commander to arrange for
   aircraft security. If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security using AF Form 15.
   7.4.3. Locking or Sealing. Lock the aircraft during all missions remaining over night (RON).

7.5. Arming of Crewmembers. When directed, at least one crewmember on the flight deck and one
crewmember in the cabin compartment will carry weapons.
   7.5.1. Issue. Before departing home station, authorized crewmembers will obtain weapons, ammuni-
   tion, lock, and key. Crewmembers must present a current AF Form 523, USAF Authorization To Bear
   Firearms, to be issued a weapon. Crewmembers will be reissued the same weapon until the mission
   terminates at home station. If an armed crewmember must leave the crew en route, transfer the
   weapon to another authorized crewmember, using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   7.5.2. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing barrels if
   available. To transfer a loaded weapon to another crewmember, place the weapon on a flat surface.
   Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.
   7.5.3. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect the identity
   of armed crewmembers. Do not wear weapons off the flight line, except to and from the CCC, armor-
   ies, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities such as base operations, fleet service, cargo
   or passenger terminals, flight line cafeterias, snack bars, etc.
   7.5.4. Weapons Storage Inflight. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight or onload
   duties. When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons may be
   stored in the safe inflight. Crewmembers will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be unloaded
   before being placed in the safe.
   7.5.5. Crew Rest. During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure facility available. If a weapons
   storage facility is unavailable or the country prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure fire-
   arms and ammunition in the safe.

7.6. General Hijacking Guidance. The hijacking of an AFSOC aircraft could create a serious interna-
tional incident and jeopardize the safety of passengers and property. An aircraft is most vulnerable when
the crew is on board and the aircraft is ready for flight. Hijackers cannot be dealt with as ordinary crimi-
nals. Some are mentally disturbed, emotionally unstable individuals for whom the threat of death is not a
deterrent, but a stimulus to crime. Delay tactics have been most successful in saving lives and property.
Crews must resist all attempts to hijack their aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple discouragement
to direct physical attack with weapons. Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is
the best solution to the problem.
   7.6.1. Acceptance of Passengers. The host station passenger processing and manifesting facility
   should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers unless the aircraft commander is
   fully satisfied with these inspections. Exception: Passengers may be anti-hijack inspected at the air-
   craft by the aircrew.
58                                                                    AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

     7.6.2. Aeromedical Procedures. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking
     inspection of patients. When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will
     perform required inspections before departure.
     7.6.3. Arms and Ammunition. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or
     in hand-carried baggage on board an aircraft except special agents and guards of the Secret Service or
     State Department, and other individuals specifically authorized to carry weapons.
        7.6.3.1. Take every precaution to prevent accidental discharge of weapons. If guards or couriers
        must clear their weapons, ask them to:
            7.6.3.1.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or personnel
            before unholstering or unslinging their weapons.
            7.6.3.1.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.
     7.6.4. Troops and deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an aircraft but
     will turn it in to the troop commander or aircraft commander. Troops may carry unloaded weapons
     and ammunition on board the aircraft during combat operations. When the situation dictates, weapons
     may be loaded at the order of the troop commander or team leader.

7.7. Ground Resistance. When the aircraft is on the ground, well planned and executed actions by
ground forces and the crew provide the best opportunities to thwart a hijacking. Crewmembers (including
ACMs) will know who is armed.
     7.7.1. Initial Action. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground forces and the air-
     crew to evaluate the situation and coordinate their efforts.
     7.7.2. Communications. Establish communications with ground agencies using radios, IFF/SIF
     equipment, or any covert means available.
     7.7.3. Delaying Actions. Continue to delay until, in the judgment of the aircraft commander, further
     delay may result in homicidal attempts by the hijacker.
     7.7.4. Positive Detainment. The aircraft will be detained or disabled when:
        7.7.4.1. Requested by the aircraft commander.
        7.7.4.2. Directed by COMAFSOC or higher for national security.
     7.7.5. Local Procedures. The aircraft commander will review local ground support anti-hijacking
     procedures at en route bases before departure.

7.8. Inflight Resistance. After an aircraft is airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking attempt depends
on the resourcefulness of the crew. Take advantage of any opportunity to regain control of the aircraft or
influence the conduct of the flight.
     7.8.1. If the hijacker does not permit the use of the radio and the aircraft is under positive control of
     an ATC facility, attempt to communicate by using the transponder/IFF/SIF.
     7.8.2. Notify crew and passengers of the situation as soon as practical for maximum assistance
     against the hijacker.
     7.8.3. Be as negative to all the hijacker’s demands as possible. Initial response to the hijacker should
     leave the issue in doubt. Try to calm the hijacker. Get the hijacker to talk.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                             59

   7.8.4. Convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary for fuel, maintenance, or other prob-
   lems and these stops must be at US military installations because of incompatibility of fuel and start-
   ing units at other airfields. After landing, try to discharge passengers. Use ground forces to regain
   control of the aircraft.
   7.8.5. Give reasons for not complying with the hijacker’s demands; for example, inability to commu-
   nicate with foreign sources (radio frequency or language problem), dangers from surface-to-air mis-
   siles, antiaircraft fire, or armed intercept by hostile aircraft.
   7.8.6. Propose favorable alternatives; for example, landing in a neutral rather than unfriendly nation.
   7.8.7. As a last resort:
       7.8.7.1. Simulate emergencies to deceive the hijacker into believing a forced landing is necessary.
       7.8.7.2. Depressurize at altitude to immobilize the hijacker.
       WARNING: Since the hijacker’s symptoms of hypoxia are unpredictable, this procedure could
       have serious consequences.
       7.8.7.3. Use weapons against the hijacker.

7.9. Covert Communications. If in-the-clear radio transmissions are not possible:
   7.9.1. To report "Am being hijacked," set transponder to Mode 3, Code 7500. When unable to change
   the transponder setting or when not under radar control, transmit a radio message which includes the
   phrase "(aircraft call sign) transponder seven five zero zero."
   7.9.2. Controllers will acknowledge Code 7500 by asking the pilot to verify it. An affirmative
   response or no reply from the pilot indicates confirmation. Controllers will not ask further questions;
   they will flight follow, respond to pilot requests, and notify appropriate authorities.
   7.9.3. After the start of a hijacking, the aircrew may indicate to the air traffic controller that
   in-the-clear communications are not possible (the hijacker is in the cockpit) by using the word "TRIP"
   after the aircraft call sign prefix (THORN "TRIP" 33). The controller should respond using the word
   "TRIP" in the aircraft call sign. Use of the word "TRIP" in the aircraft call sign by the controller prior
   to its use by the aircrew asks the aircrew if clear communications are possible. In this situation, the
   aircrew response should include the word "TRIP" only if clear communications are not possible.
   After an aircrew has advised ATC that clear communications are not possible, ATC will limit radio
   transmissions to the minimum essential ATC functions until advised otherwise by the aircrew.
   7.9.4. When controllers receive a hijacking report in the clear, they assign Code 7500 to the aircraft.
   The pilot may still change to Code 7700 later, if necessary.
   7.9.5. To report "Situation appears desperate; want armed intervention," change from Code 7500 to
   7700. When unable to change the transponder setting or when not under radar control, transmit "(air-
   craft call sign) transponder seven seven zero zero."
       7.9.5.1. Remain on 7500 for at least 3 minutes or until receiving controller confirmation of Code
       7500 from the controller, whichever is sooner, before changing to Code 7700.
       7.9.5.2. Controllers treat aircraft squawking Code 7700 and not in radio contact with the ground
       as having an in-flight emergency and will follow their appropriate emergency procedures.
60                                                                    AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

     7.9.6. To report "Situation still desperate; want armed intervention and aircraft immobilized," leave
     full flaps down after landing or lower full flaps while on the ground and transmit "(aircraft call sign)
     flaps are down."
     7.9.7. To report "Leave alone-do not intervene," retract flaps after landing and transmit "(aircraft call
     sign) flaps are retracted." Pilots who retract flaps after squawking Code 7700 should return to Code
     7500 and remain on Code 7500 for the next leg of the hijacked flight unless the situation changes
     again. Transmit "(aircraft call sign) back on seven five zero zero" to emphasize that intervention is no
     longer desired.

7.10. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace:
     7.10.1. Procedures. Procedures in this paragraph should prevent hostile actions against an aircraft
     which penetrates the boundary of an unfriendly nation as a result of a hijacking. Comply with instruc-
     tions received by radio or from an interceptor. Without instructions comply with the following before
     entering unfriendly airspace:
        7.10.1.1. Maintain an altitude between 10,000 and 25,000 feet MSL, if possible.
        7.10.1.2. Fly the most direct course to the destination demanded by the hijacker, unless the
        hijacker insists on another route.
        7.10.1.3. Transmit MAYDAY on 243.0, 121.5, or 2182.
        7.10.1.4. Squawk Mode 3, Code 7700.
     7.10.2. Destruction of Classified Material. Try to destroy all classified documents and equipment on
     board the aircraft before landing in an unfriendly nation.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                   61

9.3. Debriefing. After all training flights, instructors will:
     9.3.1. Review and critique student performance.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                              63

   9.3.2. Review training requirements fulfilled for each student and aircrew member (all aircrew mem-
   bers should understand thoroughly what training was accomplished).
   9.3.3. Answer technical questions.
   9.3.4. Preview the objectives of the next mission.
   9.3.5. Complete training paperwork.

9.4. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures:
   9.4.1. Practice emergencies which require simulating an engine shutdown, or placing switches in
   other than their normal positions or an abnormal configuration, only during training, evaluation, or
   currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot is in one of the pilot seats. Instructor pilot
   candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under the supervision of a flight examiner pilot, not in a
   pilot seat, may practice simulated emergency procedures during initial or requalification upgrade
   evaluations to instructor pilot. This applies to all maneuvers in Figure 9.2. unless otherwise specified
   in the restrictions. Preface all simulated emergencies with the word "simulated" and terminate simu-
   lated emergencies when an actual emergency arises.
   9.4.2. Simulated EPs are prohibited with passengers on board. Exception: EPs required for the pur-
   poses of a functional check flight or FAA flight evaluation are authorized. In this context, personnel
   on board are required for mission accomplishment. Limit personnel to the absolute minimum
   required.
   9.4.3. Conduct simulated emergency flight procedures IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 3 and this instruc-
   tion. Use a realistic approach and do not compound emergencies. Limit simulated emergencies to
   noncritical phases of flight when possible. Notify the controlling agency if a nonstandard traffic pat-
   tern or pattern requiring special sequencing is anticipated.
   9.4.4. Request "option approach" prior to initiating an approach when a landing or low approach
   option is desired. (Example: "Request ILS option approach.")
   9.4.5. Training maneuver restrictions for specific flight maneuvers and missions are listed in Figure
   9.2.

9.5. Touch-and-Go and Stop-and-Go Landings:
   9.5.1. Touch-and-Go Landings. Authorized only on designated training, evaluation, or currency mis-
   sions.
      9.5.1.1. Touch-and-go landings may be performed by:
          9.5.1.1.1. Instructor pilots, instructor pilot candidates on initial or requalification instructor
          evaluations, or flight examiner pilots in either pilot seat.
          9.5.1.1.2. Any pilot from either seat providing an instructor pilot, instructor pilot candidate on
          initial or requalification instructor evaluation, or flight examiner pilot is in the other seat.
      9.5.1.2. Touch-and-go landings are authorized when crosswind component corrected for RCR is
      within the recommended zone of the landing crosswind chart. Ceiling and visibility (RVR) must
      be at least 300 feet and 3/4 mile (40).
64                                                                  AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

        9.5.1.3. Touch-and-go landings are not authorized when normal wake turbulence criteria is not
        met or, when intercepting or crossing the flight path of a heavy jet while performing an approach
        or landing.
        9.5.1.4. The minimum runway for touch-and-go landings is 8,000 feet.
     9.5.2. Stop-and-Go Landings are not authorized.

                       FLIGHT ENGINEER PROCEDURES AND FORMS

11.1. General. This regulation supplements the aircraft Operations Manual and applicable technical
orders (T.O.s)EC-137D flight engineers will comply with procedures and duties specified in this instruc-
tion. With the exception of ferry flights, or when operating IAW the minimum equipment lists (MEL) or
configuration deviation lists (CDL), these items need not be briefed and will be performed as normal pro-
cedures. The aircraft commander may assign other duties to the flight engineer as necessary.

11.2. Functional and Acceptance Check Flights (FCC and ACF). All mission qualified flight engi-
neers are authorized to perform FCC and ACF duties IAW T.O. 1-1-300; AFSOCR 66-2, Functional
Check Flight Procedures: and applicable aircraft checklists.

11.3. In-Process Inspections. All flight engineers must be aware of their responsibility to perform
in-process inspections. During the assembly or reassembly of an item at those stages where further
assembly will prevent the required inspection of the item, an in-process inspection will be performed.
The in-process inspection will be documented. Engineers should be familiar with T.O.s 00-20-1, 00-20-5,
00-25-175.

11.4. Refueling and Defueling. The flight engineer may refuel and defuel when maintenance personnel
are unavailable. If ground support personnel are not available, the aircraft commander will designate
other crewmembers to assist the flight engineer.

11.5. Aircraft Systems and Forms Management.
   11.5.1. The flight engineer will monitor aircraft systems during all phases of flight and ground oper-
   ations. Notify the pilot of all abnormal indications and take action as required. When noting a mal-
   function during takeoff roll that may be cause for an abort, the malfunction should be called out
   clearly and precisely by stating, for example ’Engine Failure No. 2.’
   11.5.2. The flight engineer will assist the pilot in maintaining AFTO Forms 781 and aircraft and
   maintenance forms. After each flight, ensure discrepancies (if any) are entered. Review all discrep-
   ancies and ensure clear, detailed entries are made. Attend maintenance debrief if requested by main-
   tenance personnel to further clarify aircraft discrepancies.

11.6. Flight Monitoring. The flight engineer will assist with flight monitoring and will notify the pilot
when any of the following are noted:
   11.6.1. Deviation of more than 200 feet from the assigned altitude.
   11.6.2. Aircraft configuration is incorrect for the maneuver being performed.

11.7. Additional Inflight Duties. The flight engineer will:
   11.7.1. Maintain outside vigilance when cockpit duties allow.
   11.7.2. Monitor the primary radio and interphone system in terminal control areas, and monitor other
   radios as directed by the aircraft commander.

     11.7.3. Monitor airspeed during all phases of flight.
     11.7.4. Obtain ATIS information when possible.
     11.7.5. Transmit departure and arrival message to appropriate agencies
     11.7.6. Ensure engine limitations are maintained during all phases of ground and flight operations.

11.8. Checklists. When the pilot initiates a checklist, read and ensure timely completion of all checklist
items.

11.9. Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) Cards. Compute TOLD cards for takeoff prior to the Before
Starting Engines Checklists using the aircraft Operations Manual or approved tabulated data. Record
computed data IAW the aircraft Operations Manual.
     11.9.1. On missions requiring two flight engineers, the second engineer (scanner) may assist in
     TOLD card and weight and balance computations. The engineer at the FE panel will verify all data
     prior to departure or arrival.
     11.9.2. Computed data must equal or exceed the requirements of this regulation and the aircraft oper-
     ations manual.
     11.9.3. Following the initial takeoff and landing, only affected speeds need be recomputed if favor-
     able conditions afford an additional margin of safety in all other areas. Recompute TOLD data for
     gross weight decreases of 10,000 lbs., for pressure altitude changes of 1000 feet, and for temperature
     changes of 5 degrees C.

11.10. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). Consider data recorded on CVR tapes as classified. Erase CVR
tape after each flight and prior to leaving the aircraft. CVRs may be rendered inoperative for overseas
missions. Use the following procedures to erase the CVR tape after landing.
     11.10.1. After the aircraft is on APU or external power and parking brake is set, press the CVR erase
     button a minimum of two seconds.

11.11. Engine Condition Monitoring Log (ECM). For the ECM program to be reliable, it is necessary
to take engine readings as often and as accurately as possible. The ECM log will help ensure the engines
are capable of producing full takeoff thrust, since most operations only require reduced takeoff thrust.
     11.11.1. During each flight, complete an Inflight Data Sheet (IFDS, number 8-42207-1) IAW the
     instructions printed on the inside front cover of the ECM log. Only one reading is required during
     each flight, regardless of the length of the flight. On flights of 4 hours or longer, the taking of addi-
     tional readings is highly recommended. The ECM program becomes more effective as the number of
     readings increases. As mission requirements permit, record in-flight engine instrument readings at
     cruise thrust during any cruise leg below 42,000 feet and above 15,000 feet. Readings below 20,000
     feet are less reliable for trend analysis. However, if mission restrictions only allow altitudes between
     15,000 and 20,000 feet, record the readings at best available altitude. Readings taken below 15,000
     feet cannot be used for trend analysis.
     11.11.2. When restrictions preclude the requirements in paragraph 11.11.1. (e.g., inflight turbulence,
     local trainer below 15,000 feet, etc.), provide an IFDS to maintenance and indicate the date flown,
     hours flown, and reason for non-accomplishment in the remarks block on the IFDS.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                          69

   11.11.3. Use Zulu date and time. Upon reaching cruise altitude and speed, set cruise EPR (same EPR
   on all engines) and let speed and engines stabilize for five minutes.
   11.11.4. To fool proof the ECM and maintenance logs, put the ECM log number in the "Remarks"
   block of the E-Systems maintenance log. Transcribe the date and sortie number from the E-Systems
   maintenance log onto the "Flt. No." on the ECM log.

11.12. Weight and Balance. Weight and balance will be completed before flight when an aircraft has
been loaded in a manner for which no previous valid weight and balance form is available. These forms
serve as a certificate of proper weight and balance. The flight engineer is responsible for completing the
weight and balance forms. Approved tabulated CG% charts may be used during multiple traffic patterns
(e.g., local proficiency sorties).

11.13. Flight Planning.
   11.13.1. Check or perform the following on all flights:
       11.13.1.1. Runway and taxiway loading restrictions.
       11.13.1.2. Fuel planning.
       11.13.1.3. Obstacle criteria.
       11.13.1.4. PPR requirements.
       11.13.1.5. Aircraft maintenance status.
       11.13.1.6. Weather forecast.
       11.13.1.7. Training requirements.
       11.13.1.8. Attend aircraft commander’s brief at designated briefing time.
       11.13.1.9. Coordinate show time at aircraft and Coordination of fuel should be done with mainte-
       nance supervisor or CFS supervisor if the maintenance supervisor is not available.
   11.13.2. Check or perform the following on all local proficiency flights.
       11.13.2.1. Review recall procedure (BOLD FACE) for immediate action items.
       11.13.2.2. When other than standard ramp load is required, coordinate the fuel load with mainte-
       nance supervisor or CFS supervisor if the maintenance supervisor is not available.
   11.13.3. Check or perform the following on all off station flights.
       11.13.3.1. Check the trip kit and ensure it contains the information listed on the index page.
       Replace missing or obsolete forms, regulations, FCIS’S, etc.
       11.13.3.2. Plan fuel load for mission duration and compare to preplanned setup sheet.
       11.13.3.3. Compute the weight and balance form for the planned offload/onload requirements.
   11.13.4. Check or perform the following on all inflight refueling missions.
       11.13.4.1. During inflight refueling missions verify fuel onload and ensure fuel does not exceed
       the 90% chart.
       11.13.4.2. Verify TACAN paired frequency for rendezvous.
70                                                                  AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

11.14. Aircraft Preflight for Alert Aircraft Launches. When the alert aircraft is launched with a short
notice, as a minimum complete asterisk items in normal procedures section of aircraft operations manual.
If maintenance has already performed the "power on" portion of preflight, verify switch positions and pro-
ceed with Preliminary Cockpit Preparation.

11.15. Towing Procedures . Flight engineers will may act as a tow team member, tow supervisor or tow
vehicle operator if they are trained and qualified IAW OI 10-104, Towing Procedures.
     11.15.1. During towing operation, shut the APU off prior to any part of the aircraft entering a hanger
     and do not restart the APU until the aircraft is completely clear of the hanger.

           COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS OPERATOR PROCEDURES AND FORMS

13.1. General . This instruction establishes procedures for Air Force Special Operations Command
(AFSOC) Communication Systems Operators (CSO) and prescribes the forms used in accomplishing
their duties. It applies to all AFSOC CSOs flying on AFSOC-owned or AFSOC-chartered aircraft. The
terms Communications Systems Operator (CSO) and Radio Operator (RO) may be used interchangeably
in this and other publications. In addition to the duties established in applicable technical orders and other
directives, CSOs will comply with the procedures and duties in this regulation. The aircraft commander
may assign other duties as necessary. The CSO will:
     13.1.1. Attend crew briefings to obtain all pertinent information on purpose, route of flight, mission
     objective, and communications requirements. Record pertinent mission information on the locally
     produced communications worksheet.
     13.1.2. Coordinate communications requirements, frequencies, and any special procedures necessary
     to ensure optimum communications coverage is provided.
     13.1.3. Sign out and maintain control of all COMSEC and classified documents required by the CSO
     during the mission. Encode, decode, and authenticate messages as required. Use authentication sys-
     tems to identify friendly units. Ensure all COMSEC and classified materials are returned to proper
     storage facilities.
     13.1.4. Preflight all communications equipment to ensure satisfactory operation.
     13.1.5. Ensure IFF/SIF Modes II and IV are set IAW mission requirements.
     13.1.6. Maintain continuous communications with appropriate air traffic control agencies, mission
     command, and control agencies, and other mission/support aircraft as necessary. Use secure commu-
     nications to the maximum extent possible. Mission tasking will control when and where secure com-
     munications are utilized.
     13.1.7. Provide a documented record of all pertinent events during the mission using AFSOC Form
     55, Airborne Radio Log.
     13.1.8. Troubleshoot and repair/swap malfunctioning communications equipment inflight and at
     locations where qualified ground maintenance personnel are not available. Communications equip-
     ment repair is limited to the scope of the appropriate aircraft technical order or equipment documenta-
     tion.
     13.1.9. Initiate and maintain communications with command authorities during mission events.
     Establish and maintain communications with other agencies, including ATC, as directed by the air-
     craft commander.
     13.1.10. Establish emergency communications through the use of national or international procedures
     when directed by the pilot.
     13.1.11. Zeroize all cryptographic devices and clear classified frequencies prior to leaving the air-
     craft.
AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001                                                                            75

   13.1.12. Configure and operate secure voice, anti-jam voice/data systems, self-contained navigation
   system (SCNS), data-burst terminals (DBT), digital message data group (DMDG), airborne comput-
   erized communications terminals (ACCT), and other computer/data devices as required.

13.2. Aircraft Interphone and Radio. The CSO will monitor the primary radio, normally UHF/VHF,
and interphone at all times except when the use of HF or SATCOM precludes monitoring these radios.
The CSO will notify the pilot before leaving and when returning to their duty station.

13.3. Communications Procedures. Communications procedures used during all phases of a mission
are directly related to the type of mission being flown. Each CSO will be knowledgeable of operational
environments described below:
   13.3.1. Communications Checks. Communications checks made during preflight, enroute and post-
   flight will be IAW ACP 121, US Sup-2. It is the responsibility of all CSOs to be cognizant of their
   OPSEC requirements prior to making any communications checks.
   13.3.2. Allied Communications Publication (ACP) 121 series, as supplemented, prescribes proce-
   dures for HF communications between aircraft and ground stations for most circumstances. All CSOs
   must be proficient in the use of these ACPs in addition to ACP 122, 131, 135, 160 (US Sup 1C), and
   Joint Army Navy Air Force Publication (JANAP) 146. Ensure long-range communications, normally
   HF, are established prior to departing VHF/UHF range.
   13.3.3. Communications necessary to support covert or sensitive operations dictate the CSO blend in
   with certain existing or mobile ground stations and avoid attracting attention to the mission. CSOs
   will use "ground" style communications procedures IAW ACP 125, instead of ACP 121 US Supp-2,
   when flying in a tactical (mission) environment and will make every effort to avoid identifying their
   station as an aircraft. Long-range communications channels will be as directed by the mission con-
   trolling authority.
   13.3.4. Communications Reports. Forward all ATC communications and associated air reports
   (AIREP) to ICAO aeronautical stations in accordance with FLIP General Planning, FLIP charts, and
   FLIP Flight Information Handbook (FIH). ICAO HF en route position reporting must be IAW FIH
   and applicable FLIP documents. Pass C2 and all other operational communications through the USAF
   HF/SSB Global Command and Control System (GCCS) or the dedicated command and control station
   assigned by the mission controlling authority.
   13.3.5. Classified Transmissions. If classified transmissions are made during a flight, power SHALL
   remain applied to the Cockpit Voice Recorder for at least 30 minutes after the final classified transmis-
   sion is completed.

13.4. AFSOC Form 55, Airborne Radio Log. The CSO will complete a single AFSOC Form 55 for
each day’s flight or flights.
   13.4.1. Radio logs are normally unclassified, however, if classified information is entered into the
   radio log, it must be properly marked. Complete the log IAW Attachment 1. File completed unclas-
   sified logs chronologically in a transitory file. Dispose of logs IAW AFMAN 37-139. Classified logs
   will be handled and stored IAW current security directives. Maintaining log entries is the lowest mis-
   sion priority.
76                                                                      AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

     13.4.2. An execution checklist may be used on certain flights. Annotate times in the appropriate
     blocks, if an execution checklist is used. If the execution checklist is unclassified, it may be attached
     to the radio log in lieu of duplicate log entries. If the execution checklist is classified, do not attach it
     to the radio log unless the radio log is also classified. A separate radio log will be maintained at all
     times.
     13.4.3. Airborne Radio Log may be completed electronically or by hand (manually). When com-
     pleted manually, it should be filled out using non-erasable type ink. Complete this form as follows:
         13.4.3.1. Log Heading : Complete the entire log heading for page 1. Headings of subsequent
         pages need only contain call sign, date, page number, mission, and operator’s name(s).

           classified. Use the assigned designator for classified frequencies. Unclassified designators, if
           assigned, may also be used.
           13.4.3.4.2. Enter SATCOM for all calls made over the SATCOM system.
           13.4.3.4.3. Enter LOG for all notes or comments that do not involve a radio transmission.
       13.4.3.5. Message/Remarks :
           13.4.3.5.1. The first entry will be the statement "ON WATCH" followed by the CSO’s signa-
           ture. The last entry will be the statement "OFF WATCH" followed by the CSO’s signature. On
           augmented missions, only the CSO sitting in the seat for takeoff is required to sign on and off
           watch. If other CSOs make log entries, they will place a double slash (//) at the end of the
           MESSAGE/REMARKS entry and initial the entry.
           13.4.3.5.2. CSOs may exchange watch by using ON WATCH/OFF WATCH entries. The
           CSO on watch at the end of the radio day will make an entry indicating the end of the current
           radio day and a separate entry for the start of the new radio day. The end of the radio day,
           (midnight Zulu) is designated 2400Z, and 0001Z is the beginning of the new radio day. Radio
           log entries will read "2400 NOTE LOG End RADAY" and "0001 NOTE LOG Begin
           RADAY."
       13.4.3.6. Abbreviations and operating signals (ACP 131), FLIP abbreviations and other aeronau-
       tical related abbreviations may be used in radio log entries. Use brackets, [ ], to enclose important
       information, simulated transmissions, transmission summaries, or any other information neces-
       sary in the log, but not actually transmitted over the radios. Otherwise, enter sent or received
       information verbatim.
       13.4.3.7. Entry Corrections . Entry corrections may be made electronically or manually. Elec-
       tronic and manual corrections may be made to the same document as required.
           13.4.3.7.1. Electronic Corrections. Electronic corrections may be made as required at any
           time before mission completion.
           13.4.3.7.2. Manual Corrections. Make manual corrections to the form by lining out the incor-
           rect portion and initialing at the end of the lined out portion. Enter the correct information
           immediately after the lined out portion.

13.5. Communications Worksheet. Each flying squadron will develop a local communications work-
sheet specifically oriented to its mission. The CSO will complete this locally produced communications
worksheet for all flights, IAW local instructions. The local communications worksheet must be designed
to be used both during mission planning and inflight as a guide. At the completion of each mission this
form may be destroyed.

13.6. Frequency Listing. Attachment 2 contains a listing of frequencies that are commonly used. This
list contains search and rescue and Citizen Band frequency conversion table.

13.7. Weather Forecasts . For all flights outside the local area, the CSO will obtain the destination and
alternate (if applicable) forecasts, to include pressure altitude and temperature, before reaching the equal
time point and one hour prior to ETA. When marginal weather is expected, provide the pilot with earlier
78                                                                AFI11-2EC-137V3 19 APRIL 2001

forecasts and timely updates, to include alternate landing fields. Whenever SIGMETs are received from
any source, contact the nearest USAF weather facility to determine mission applicability.

13.8. Communications Systems Operator Information Guides (CSOIG). CSOIGs are used to con-
solidate communications information, procedures, policies, etc. for quick reference during mission plan-
ning, preflight, inflight, and postflight duties. CSOIGs will be overprinted on AFSOC Form 54, AFSOC
Flight Crew Information Guide. Group Stan/Eval is the approval authority for unit CSOIGs. Each unit
maintaining these guides will review them annually for currency and document the review.

NOTES:
  1. Modes are V for voice, CW for International Morse Code and FM for VHF/FM.
  2. The USAF RFA list is the authority for the use of these frequencies.
  3. AFMAN 33-120 and Joint Publication 3-50 Volume 1 explain the use of these frequencies, which
     are authorized in the RFA or the ITU Radio Regulations (see note 4).
  4. The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Convention of 1959 promulgated Radio Reg-
     ulations (RR 994, 999, 1107, and 1323) which permit the use of frequencies for general air-to-ship
     communications uses.
  5. In order to be on the correct frequency, ensure HF equipment is set to AM, not Upper Side Band
     (USB).
  6. Emission is amplitude modulation (AM) only.

1 DECEMBER 1999

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This interim change (IC) 99-1 corrects the Airfield Review to use KC-135 suitability codes and restric-
tions in paragraph 6.5; adjusts crew composition for Inflight Refuel in Figure 3.1. EC-137D Crew Com-
plement. See the last attachment of the publication, IC 99-1, for the complete IC. A bar (|) indicates
revision from the previous edition.

6.5. Airfield Review. Aircraft commanders and other appropriate crewmembers will review all appro-
priate publications (e.g., FLIP, Jeppesen, HQ AMC Airfield Suitability and Restriction Report (ASRR)
etc.) to determine airfield suitability. Crewmembers will review the HQ AMC Airfield Suitability and
Restriction Report (ASRR) for any mission that will land/operate away from home station. If available,
review the airport qualification audiovisual program. Crews will check the suitability codes and, if possi-
ble, adhere to all restrictions for an airfield. Since the EC-137 aircraft is not identified in the ASRR,
KC-135 restrictions will apply. If a restriction applies to KC-135 aircraft, AFSOC EC-137 crews must
comply. Waiver authority for ASRR restrictions is AFSOC/DO. Process waivers through stan/eval chan-
nels. See AFI 11-202 Volume 3, Chapter 2 and the AFSOC SUP to Volume 3.
NOTE: HQ AMC updates the ASRR on the internet between formal publications. Updates may be found
at www.safb.af.mil:81/hqamc/diratorates/amcdo/doa/doas.htm

 NOTES:
 1. An FA is only required when passengers are carried. One FA (First FA qualified) is required if 21
 or less passengers are carried. Two FAs (one of which is First FA qualified) are required for more than
 21 passengers. Mission and/or passenger requirements may dictate up to four FAs. Unit DO will
 determine CSO and FA requirements for each mission.
 2. The aircraft commander must be instructor or flight examiner qualified on DV Code 6 or higher
 missions.
 3. Required if any IFR events are planned after 14 hours CDT. Requires two IFR qualified aircraft
 commanders.
