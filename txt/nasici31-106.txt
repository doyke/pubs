1. PURPOSE: To establish policies and procedures governing the entry and exit, control,
issuance, usage and connectivity of portable electronic devices (PEDs) in NASIC facilities. A
PED is a generic term used to describe the myriad of small electronic items that are widely
available. The rapid growth in technology capabilities of PEDs has led to concerns about their
access into and out of collateral areas and Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities
(SCIFs).     A PED generally includes any easily transportable electronic device that has a
capability to store, record and/or transmit (radio frequency or infrared) data, digital
images/video, or audio. Examples of a PED include, but are not limited to, pagers (one-way or
two-way), laptop computers, cellular telephones, radios (FM, AM, satellite radios), portable data
assistant (palm tops, Blackberry, IPAQ, etc.), digital audio devices (MP3 players), cameras,
camcorders, calculators and electronic watches with input capability and reminder recorders.
These devices must be closely monitored to ensure effective control and protection of all
information within the NASIC SCIF.
2. RISK: PEDs may pose a risk to classified intelligence information because PEDs are
designed to freely and openly exchange information and users may not be aware of the
technologies that reside in the various PEDs. These devices may contain wireless or infrared
capabilities. Thus, users do not always know when automated information transfer is active or
that the PED is being reprogrammed or reconfigured remotely without their knowledge. This
instruction balances the need for security with the safety and quality of life of the work force,
especially with regard to the use of government and personally-owned PEDs.

3. RESPONSIBILITIES:
  3.1. Group Commanders/Directors shall exercise overall responsibility for controlling
  the introduction and use of government PEDs within their organizations.
     3.1.1. Group Commanders/Directors must appoint an Information Assurance Officer
     (IAO) for any government-owned laptops under their control. (Attachment 1)
  3.2. Directorate of Security (SO) shall:
     3.2.1. Investigate reported violations of this instruction in accordance with the guidelines
     pertaining to security incidents.
     3.2.2. Develop and provide jointly with the Directorate of Communications and
     Information (NASIC/SC) the security awareness training on PED vulnerabilities, threats
     and risk mitigations for the workforce.
     3.2.3. Coordinate on exceptions to this instruction with NASIC/SC, whenever these
     exceptions involve NASIC's information systems.
     3.2.4. In collaboration with NASIC/SC, review purchase requests for government-owned
     PEDs that may be introduced or used within NASIC collateral and SCIF areas to ensure
     potential vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies are addressed prior to the expenditure of

     3.4.1. Ensure the planned acquisitions of government-owned PEDs are reviewed by
     NASIC/SO and NASIC/SC, as appropriate, prior to the expenditure of Agency funds.
     3.4.2. Ensure the provisions of this instruction are binding on NASIC contracts.
  3.5. Staff Agency Security Manager (SASM) shall:
     3.5.1. Provide education and oversight of this instruction within their respective
     organization.
  3.6. The NASIC workforce shall:
     3.6.1. Use government-owned PEDs only for official and authorized use.
     3.6.2. Protect government-owned PEDs from unauthorized access and theft.
     3.6.3. Apply the appropriate security safeguards described in the enclosure for any PED
     introduced or used within NASIC collateral and SCIF areas.
     3.6.4. Agree that introduction of a personally-owned PED into a NASIC collateral and
     SCIF areas will constitute consent to inspection, search or seizure of the PED, to include
 4                                                            NASIC31-106 11 AUGUST 2010


        the content and metadata that may be examined as a result of such inspection of a
        personally-owned PED.
            3.6.4.1. Complete and get approval of Personally-Owned PED User Agreement
            (Attachment2) or Government/Contractor PED User Agreement (Attachment 3) prior

            accompany the PED User Agreement.
        3.6.5. Report any violation of this instruction to their SASM, the Security Office, or the
        Information Assurance Office.
4. PROCEDURES: The use of PEDs in NASIC facilities presents a degree of risk for the
compromise of classified or sensitive information. Therefore, the introduction and use of a PED
is a privilege and is dependent upon the prescribed security safeguards in this operating
instruction.
     4.1. The introduction and use of a PED within a collateral or SCIF area is dependent upon
     the security safeguards listed in PED Countermeasure Matrix (Attachment 4). Since a single
     PED may have multiple functions/capabilities, each function/capability must be addressed
     separately with an appropriate safeguard.
     4.2. Personally-owned PEDS:
        4.2.1. Personally-owned PEDS are prohibited from processing classified information.
        Connecting personally-owned PEDs to any information processing system inside NASIC
        facilities is prohibited.
        4.2.2. All NASIC employees and visitors are encouraged to leave unauthorized PEDs
        outside NASIC facilities. When this is impractical, such as for people who use public
        transportation, PEDs must be stored in a NASIC-provided storage container located by
        the entrances.
        4.2.3. It is the responsibility of the NASIC host to ensure that the visitors are aware of
        this policy.
        4.2.4. The introduction of a PED into NASIC facilities constitutes consent to search.
        This inspection will result in examination of all content and metadata residing on the
        PED which may include sharing of that data with investigative personnel who have the
        assigned mission and function to evaluate all the content and data. The examination may
        result in data loss, compromise of PED functions and damage or destruction of the PED.
        PEDs containing evidence of a crime or security violation will be handled under NASIC
        investigative policies. In some cases, PEDs may be permanently retained, destroyed, or
        have their data and operating systems sanitized.
     4.3. Government-owned and contractor-owned PEDs:
        4.3.1. Government- and contractor-owned PEDs may be approved to process and/or be
        connected to government information systems (IS) (classified or unclassified) provided
        usage and storage is specified and approved by the Information Assurance Manager
        (IAM).
        4.3.2. Government-owned PEDs are subject to the security safeguards that are described
        in the PED Countermeasure Matrix (Attachment 4). To maximize security, use of special
NASIC31-106 11 AUGUST 2010                                                                     5


      radio frequency bags as described for medium or high vulnerability PEDs is
      recommended. NOTE: On Blackberry units, just powering off the BlackBerry does not
      disable the RF capability. The unit is still able to receive messages and acknowledges
      those back to the tower.
      4.3.3. Contractor-owned PEDs used in support of NASIC contracts are subject to the
      same restrictions as government-owned PEDs. These contractor-owned PEDs must be
      documented in a DD Form 254, Department of Defense Contract Security Classification
      Specification or Statement of Work. Whenever contractor-owned PEDs are not annotated
      in either of these documents, prior approval must be obtained by NASIC/SO and
      NASIC/SC, who will verify with the appropriate Contracting Officer Representative that
      the use of the PED supports a mission essential task.
      4.3.4. Government and contractor-owned PEDs connected to any of NASIC's ISs are
      subject to security configuration requirements stated in References (a & f) and local
      security policies.
      4.3.5. Laptops:
          4.3.5.1. All Government- and contractor-owned laptops must have an Information
          Assurance Officer (IAO) appointed in writing and approved by the Information
          Assurance Manager (IAM).
             4.3.5.1.1. IAOs are responsible for ensuring approval to operate is obtained.
          4.3.5.2. NASIC loaner laptops are subject to the same provisions as stated in 4.3.5.1.
          4.3.5.3. Users will meet the terms defined in the NASIC Laptop Loaner Program
          (Attachment 5).
          4.3.5.4. Any connection to a NASIC network requires DAA (or designee) and
          Information Assurance Manager (IAM) approval.
   4.4. Security Awareness:
      4.4.1. Agency workforce, including contractors, will receive initial security awareness
      training that focuses on PED vulnerabilities and security procedures.

MEMORANDUM FOR NASIC PERSONAL WIRELESS DEVICE USERS

FROM: NASIC/SC

SUBJECT: Personal Wireless Device User Agreement

1. Non-government issued PWDs (i.e., cell phones, BlackBerry’s or other portable electronic
devices with transmit and receive capabilities) are not authorized inside the NASIC facility at
any time.

2. All users of government-issued Personal Wireless Devices (PWD) must understand and
adhere to these guidelines upon issue of the device:

a. PWDs may be brought into the NASIC facility provided they are
(1) powered off with the battery removed, or (2) powered off and placed in an RF shielded bag
that is provided by TEMPEST office (NASIC/SCXS).

EXCEPTION: If deemed mission essential, BlackBerry devices may be used in the off-line mode
(e.g., viewing static calendar and email) by turning off the wireless RF/IR capabilities. However,
on-line wireless (e.g. sending/receiving e-mails and accessing the Internet) within the NASIC
SCIF is strictly prohibited.

b. PWDs can be used for UNCLASSIFIED processing only. Data at rest needs to be encrypted.
Users must not process classified information on the device at any time.

c. Use of PWDs constitutes consent to monitoring.

d. Use only authorized software that has been legally installed on the system. Users may not
download other software (including ring tones and subscription services) without prior written
approval from the Designated Organizational Representative (NASIC/SC).

e. Users may not copy or allow others to copy software that is loaded on the device.

f. Obtain approval from the NASIC Information Assurance Manager (NASIC/SCXS) prior to
connecting a PWD to a computer inside the NASIC SCIF.

g. Users may be held financially liable for lost, damaged or destroyed PWDs.

h. PWDs are subject to random inspection by authorized SO or SC personnel to ensure
appropriate use and policy compliance.

i. Users shall password protect the device and protect PWDs from unauthorized access.
NASIC31-106 11 AUGUST 2010                                                                     17



j. Users must use PWDs for official and authorized purposes only. IAW AFI 33-106, para 4.9.3,
short, infrequent personal calls may be made under certain circumstances (e.g. notifying family
members of changes in schedules, checking on medical, school, or childcare appointments, and
inquiring as to car repair status). Emergency calls are always authorized. Users making
inappropriate calls are subject to disciplinary action even if the call does not cause additional
expenses to the government. Users may be required to reimburse the government for calls that
are deemed inappropriate.

k. Upon departure from NASIC or transfer to another directorate, users must return PWD and all
associated accessories to the Telecommunications Office (NASIC/SCOS) in room 8292, phone
257-7470.

l. Users must immediately report any violation of this policy to the Information Assurance Office
(NASIC/SCXS).
