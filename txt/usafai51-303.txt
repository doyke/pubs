1. Policy : It is the policy of the Air Force Academy to honor copyrights owned by others and to obtain
releases or assignments when the Academy hires contractors to generate copyrightable works. The Air
Force Academy is a federal academic institution that is subject to certain federal laws and regulations that
do not apply to civilian academic institutions. These federal laws and regulations restrict the actions of
members of the Air Force Academy who are government employees. These restrictions arise in both the
copyright and ethics arenas and will be fully addressed in this instruction.

2. General Rule: The government does not "own" copyrights unless it purchases or receives assign-
ments of a copyright from an individual or entity that owns a copyright. It typically obtains a nonexclu-
sive license of varying scope for use of copyrighted works; unless the ownership, title, to a copyright is
necessary to protect the government’s interest and further the government’s mission. For example, if the
ownership of a copyright furthers the mission of the organization by ensuring the maximum distribution
of the work; or, if ownership would allow control of licensing to maximum the commercial use of the
work, ownership would be justified.

3. What is a copyright?
   3.1. A copyright is a Constitutional right codified in Title 17, United States Code (U.S.C.), Copy-
   rights. Copyright protection subsists in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of
   expression. Works of authorship include: literary works, musical works, dramatic works, choreo-
   graphic works, pictorial, graphical or sculptural works, sound recordings, architectural works, data-
   bases, software, and digital works.
   3.2. A copyright establishes exclusive legal rights for authors over their works for a limited period of
   time. Such rights include:
       3.2.1. Copying the works (including parts of the works);
       3.2.2. Making derivative works: i.e., a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a
       translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound
       recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, any other form in which a work may be
       recast, transformed, or adapted, or a work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elabora-
       tions, or other modification which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship;
       3.2.3. Distributing the works;
       3.2.4. Performing the works: i.e., showing a movie or playing an audio recording, as well as per-
       forming a dramatic work; and
       3.2.5. Electronic transmission of a work.
   3.3. Rights of an author begin when the work is created. That is, the author’s rights begin when the
   work is “fixed,’ not when the work is conceived. A copyright notice is no longer required to put the
   public on notice that the author has a copyright in a work. Copyright protections attach for a limited
   period of time, as per the Constitutional requirement that “[secures] for limited times to authors and
   inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries. For "works" created after
   1978, copyright protection for a work of an individual author lasts for the life of the author plus 70
   years. Copyright protection for "works made-for-hire" last for 95 years from publication or 120 years
   from creation, whichever comes first (see 17 U.S.C. 302). "Works made-for-hire" generally include
   "works" made by employees for their employer.
4                                                                  USAFAI51-303 22 NOVEMBER 2006


    3.4. Copyrights are granted in order to protect an individual's original work and also possible deriva-
    tives there from. Copyrights also protect the author’s right to be compensated for others’ use of his or
    her original "work". This protection automatically attaches to a work as soon as it is "fixed" in a tan-
    gible medium. For example, merely reciting an original poem to an audience is insufficient to obtain
    copyright protection for that poem. Rather, the poem must be recorded or placed in written form for
    copyright protection to attach. Note that registration, designation, or notice is not necessary to gener-
    ate the copyright protection. However, registration and notice is required (and recommended) in order
    for the copyright holder to take advantage of all protections afforded to him or her under the Copy-
    right Act.
    3.5. A copyright protects the "expression" of the work, not the idea, procedure, process, system,
    method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery contained within the work. The exclusion of
    facts and ideas from copyright protection promotes the public policy goal of promoting the progress
    of science and useful arts. Likewise, the facts contained within a database are not subject to copyright
    protection. Rather, the presentation and organizational scheme of the database, itself, is what is pro-
    tected by copyright.
    3.6. Copyright protection only extends to the reproduction and distribution of the "works”. It does not
    restrict access to them. This means that the public has a right to inspect the works without regard to
    copyright interests.

4. Typical Events that Generate Copyright Issues.
    4.1. Publication of a book, chapters of books or articles by a professor, cadet or contractor at the
    Academy.
       4.1.1. Preparation and performance or publication of movies, slideshows, lectures, presentations
       by a professor, cadet or contract at the Academy.
    4.2. Publication of papers given at a conference attended by Academy personnel.
       4.2.1. Who owns the copyright: the author, the Government, the publisher, a university, a contrac-
       tor, or some other third party?
    4.3. Deliverables that are paid for by the government under a contract.
       4.3.1. Does the agreement include a government use license?
       4.3.2. Does the agreement transfer copyright ownership to the government?
    4.4. A deliverable is the "work" that is to be delivered under the contract. Examples include a book,
    paper, drawing, painting, etc.
       4.4.1. Does the contract include a government use license?
       4.4.2. Does the agreement transfer copyright ownership to the government?

5. Works of the Government and Copyright.
    5.1. If a government employee (See also Paragraph 9. below, Generation of Works by Contractors)
    prepares a work as part of his or her official duties the work does not have copyright protection. See
    17 U.S.C. 105. As a result, there is no copyright that can be transferred or assigned in this work. Often,
    publishers will require authors to assign their copyright interest to the publisher using a form letter. If
USAFAI51-303 22 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                               5


   the "work" was created as part of his or her official duties, authors should use the section signifying
   that the "work" was created by the government. If this option is not available, consult your servicing
   legal office. (See Paragraph 15. below, Delegations of Authority)
   5.2. A government employee can secure a copyright in a work written (1) at that person's own volition
   and (2) outside of his or her duties. This is true even if the subject matter of the work involves the pro-
   fessional field of the official or employee.
   5.3. Whether a particular work is prepared as part of employee's official duties requires a
   case-by-case inquiry that weighs the following (non-exhaustive) list of factors. No one factor is dis-
   positive. The author should consult his or her servicing judge advocate for advice prior to writing.
   (See Paragraph 15. below, Delegations of Authority)
      5.3.1. Was preparation of the work listed in the employee's job description or key duties in an offi-
      cial performance report?
      5.3.2. Was the employee directed to create the work by superiors?
      5.3.3. Was the employee a high-ranking official whose duties should be interpreted broadly?
      5.3.4. Was the work created, in whole or in part, on government time?
      5.3.5. Was the work created, in whole or in part, using government resources?

6. Compensation for Teaching, Speaking and Writing.
   6.1. An employee, including a special government employee, shall not receive compensation from
   any source other than the Government for teaching, speaking, or writing that relates to the employee's
   official duties. The following criteria are taken from 5 C.F.R. 2635.807 (a)(2)(i) (B)-(E), Outside
   Activities. If the work falls under one of the following, then compensation cannot be accepted. Note
   that the definition for "official duties" for compensation in ethics is different than the one for copy-
   right in paragraph 5.3. above.
      6.1.1. The activity is undertaken as part of the employee's official duties as set forth in the
      employee's job description;
      6.1.2. The circumstances indicate that an employee has been invited to engage in generating the
      work primarily because of his or her official position rather than the individual's expertise on the
      particular subject matter.
      6.1.3. The employee has been invited to engage in the generation of a work or been offered com-
      pensation for the generation of a work, directly or indirectly, by a person who has an interest that
      may be affected substantially by performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties;
      6.1.4. The information conveyed through the activity draws substantially on ideas or official data
      that are nonpublic information (See 5 C.F.R. 2635.703(b), Use of Nonpublic Information); or
      6.1.5. Unless an employee is serving as a "Special Government Employee", the subject of the
      activity deals in significant part with
          6.1.5.1. Any matter to which the employee presently is assigned or to which the employee had
          been assigned during the previous one-year period; [and]
          6.1.5.2. Any ongoing or announced policy, program or operation of the agency.
6                                                                 USAFAI51-303 22 NOVEMBER 2006


           6.1.5.3. See 5 C.F.R. 2635.807(a)(2)(i)(E)(4) for an explanation of Special Government
           Employee.
       6.1.6. If an employee's work does not fall under one of the above, the next step is to determine if:
           6.1.6.1. The employee's work specially and significantly overlaps with the substantive work
           of the Academy. If so, the work should be considered part of the employee's official duties.
           6.1.6.2. The work is the result of an employee's individual choice rather than the result of a
           specific tasking by an academic department. If so, it supports a finding that the work is not part
           of the employee's official duties.
           6.1.6.3. The work is self directed, self motivated by the employee as part of the employee's
           desire to enhance his or her professional standing in the profession. If so, it also supports a
           finding that the work is not part of that employee's official duties for ethics purposes.

7. Restrictions on Employees who have a Copyrightable Interest in a Work.
    7.1. If an employee possesses a copyright in a work, the employee may have a conflict of interest
    regarding the acceptance of payments or royalties from the publication or sale of the work to others.
    In order to avoid these conflicts of interest, the employee should seek an ethics opinion from his or her
    servicing legal office (See Paragraph 15. below, Delegations of Authority) prior to negotiation of any
    such agreement.
    7.2. If a work is generated as part of an employee's official duties, the employee is authorized to use
    Government resources,
    7.3. If a work is generated as a non-commercial personal work, and it is to be presented to a nonprofit
    professional association, learned society, or to be published in a professional journal, the employee
    may make limited use of Federal Government equipment and administrative support services to pre-
    pare such works, when:
       7.3.1. The work is related to the employee's official position or to Department of Defense (DoD)
       functions, management or mission;
       7.3.2. The Academy can derive some benefit from the participation or preparation, such as expan-
       sion of professional expertise by Academy employees or improved public confidence derived
       from the professional recognition of the Academy's employee's competence; and,
       7.3.3. The preparation of the work does not interfere with the performance of the employee's offi-
       cial duties.
       7.3.4. Further guidance is found in Joint Ethics Regulation (JER, DoD 5500.7- R) §3-300, Partic-
       ipation, and a formal ethics opinion from the servicing legal office (See Paragraph 15. below, Del-
       egations of Authority) is suggested prior to initiation of a project to generate a work for this
       non-commercial purpose.
    7.4. If a work is being generated for a commercial purpose and is not part of an employee's official
    duties, the employee must obtain permission from the head of the department if any use of Govern-
    ment resources is anticipated. Note: No assistance from government employees is authorized to sup-
    port such a project. Because of the potential of a JER violation, the employee should obtain an
    "advance" ethics opinion from his or her servicing legal office (See Paragraph 15. below, Delegations
    of Authority) prior to using Government resources. JER §2-301, subsection (b), Official Use of Fed-
USAFAI51-303 22 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                               7


   eral Government Resources, provides guidance for the use of Government resources for commercial
   purposes. Before Government resources can be used, a formal determination must be made that:
      7.4.1. The use does not adversely affect the performance of official duties by the DoD employee
      or organization;
      7.4.2. The use is of reasonable duration and frequency, and made only during the DoD employee's
      personal time such [as] after duty hours or lunch periods;
      7.4.3. The use serves a legitimate public interest (such as support local charities or volunteer ser-
      vices to the community; enhancing the professional skills of the DoD employee; job-searching in
      response to Federal Government downsizing);
      7.4.4. The use does not put Federal Government resources to uses that would reflect adversely on
      DoD or the DoD Component (such as involving commercial activities; unofficial advertising,
      soliciting or selling; violation of statute or regulation; and other uses that are incompatible with
      public service); and
      7.4.5. The use creates no significant additional cost to DoD or the DoD Component.

8. Works Generated by Visiting Professors and in Collaboration with Visiting Professors.
   8.1. If a Visiting Professor prepares a work, that work will most likely be copyrightable. The rights to
   the copyright should be controlled by the Agreement between the government and the college or uni-
   versity. If possible, the government should obtain an assignment of the Visiting Professor's copyright
   so the public can enjoy the benefit of that work without copyright restrictions.
   8.2. When Visiting Professors work with government employees to create works, the copyright inter-
   est of the Visiting Professors needs to be resolved. If the Visiting Professor retains a copyright interest
   in the work, that work may not be releasable as a public document and any subsequent publication
   must address the Visiting Professor's copyright interest.
   8.3. As a matter of policy, a Visiting Professor should grant the government a special purpose license
   to the copyrighted work so the government can use the work for its intended purposes. If the Visiting
   Professor will not grant the license, that issue should be raised and addressed by the Head of the
   Department. The Visiting Professor's copyright interest must be established prior to generation of the
   work and documented by the Department. This documentation is necessary to defend infringement
   claims and is also necessary as part of any future FOIA analysis.

9. Generation of Works by Contractors.
   9.1. If a contractor employee prepares a work that is eligible for copyright protection, the rights to the
   copyright are governed by the contract. Care should be taken to ensure that the copyright issues are
   addressed and represent the intent of the parties.
   9.2. As a general rule, the government acquires only a nonexclusive license in copyrighted works pre-
   pared under a funding agreement, (i.e., procurement contract, grant cooperative agreement) or under a
   cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA). If the government has specific need to
   control the distribution of works first produced, created, or generated in the performance of the fund-
   ing agreement or CRADA, an alternate clause, known as a special works clause, must be substituted
   in the agreement.
8                                                                USAFAI51-303 22 NOVEMBER 2006


    9.3. If the government has a significant interest in the work being generated and wants the public to
    have open access to the work, the government should purchase the copyright interest. The purchase of
    the copyright interest must be addressed during the negotiation of the contract to avoid restrictions on
    the use of the document by the contractor after the work is completed.

10. Compilation of Works into a Book Intended for Publication.
    10.1. If a department intends to compile articles, papers, charts, or other copyrightable documents
    into a book, the copyright interests of the authors should be addressed.
    10.2. The department must take one of the following steps with each of the articles, papers, charts, or
    other copyrightable documents that it intends to compile to address copyright issues when it intends to
    compile documents with copyrightable interests:
       10.2.1. Obtain a release of copyright from all authors prior to publication;
       10.2.2. Negotiate a copyright license that is sufficiently broad to address the government intended
       use of the book once published; or
       10.2.3. Purchase the copyright as government property.
    10.3. The supporting legal office shall provide the necessary support needed to provide the depart-
    ment with the appropriate legal documents required to address these copyrightable interests.
    10.4. Databases are also an issue when evaluating technical reports and results of research that are to
    be published. Facts cannot be copyrighted, but the selection, arrangement, and display of the facts
    may be copyrighted if the treatment of these facts is sufficiently original to support copyright protec-
    tion.

11. Requests for "Works" under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
    11.1. All FOIA requests should be reviewed by your supporting legal office. Particular attention
    should be paid to proprietary and (or) personal information that may be protected from disclosure
    under trade secret law, Privacy Act restrictions and medical data disclosure under the Health Insur-
    ance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
    11.2. If a work has no copyright, it, generally, may be reproduced and published without restriction.
    It is a work that is in the public domain. Such works include works of the U.S. Government and works
    for which copyrights have expired. Note that the lack of a copyright symbol © does not necessarily
    indicate that the work is in the public domain. Consult with your supporting legal office prior to mak-
    ing any decision regarding the public domain status of the work you wish to use.
       11.2.1. The internet raises special copyright concerns because copyright interests may not be fully
       disclosed on the internet but the copyright interests, even if not disclosed, are still enforceable.
       Particular care should be taken to address copyright issues when citing documents that have been
       the result of internet searches.
    11.3. The following examples highlight situations in which FOIA impacts copyrights and publication
    restrictions:
       11.3.1. If the government sponsors a symposium that includes the delivery of technical or scien-
       tific papers, those papers may be released to a publisher under the FOIA and published as long as
       the individuals who generated those papers assigned their copyrights to the government.
USAFAI51-303 22 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                           9


      11.3.2. An article or dissertation written by an employee or cadet as part of an Air Force Institute
      of Technology (AFIT) sponsored degree program is, in almost all cases, not copyrightable and is
      usually subject to release under FOIA.
      11.3.3. An article submitted for publication that was generated as part of an employee's official
      duties as a government employee is not copyrightable and subject to release under FOIA.
      11.3.4. If a government employee generates a book or article as part of his or her official duties,
      any publisher can request a copy of that work under FOIA and publish it.
   11.4. The above examples highlight why is it important to know the copyright status of a work and
   document the copyright status of works generated by the Academy. The following steps are necessary
   to document whether or not a work is subject to FOIA:
      11.4.1. The department who generates a work must keep a file of any copyrights retained by indi-
      viduals as a result of the generation of a work.
      11.4.2. The department must document the circumstances surrounding the generation of the work
      and seek a legal opinion from their servicing legal office. (See Paragraph 15. below, Delegations
      of Authority) Pre-planning is important in order to avoid "selling" copyrights that do not exist; or
      losing copyrights that could otherwise be protected.

12. Responsibility of Government Officers, Agents and Employees.
   12.1. Each government officer, agent, and employee acting within the scope of his or her official
   duties should:
      12.1.1. Honor private copyrights and acknowledge the owner's copyrighted material, if it is used
      in Air Force publications or other officially released material.
      12.1.2. Avoid the unauthorized use of copyrighted material. In order to avoid an unauthorized use,
      first seek permission from the copyright owner as hereinafter provided, but see Paragraph 13.4.
      below regarding "Fair Use."
      12.1.3. Each Air Force activity may seek permission in the form of a license or release to make
      limited use of copyrighted material without charge. Ordinarily, no need for special formality is
      required to obtain permission to use copyrighted material free of charge, although requesters
      should observe the following checklist in requesting permission. The request should:
          12.1.3.1. Be for no greater rights than are actually needed.
          12.1.3.2. Identify fully the material for which permission to use is requested.
          12.1.3.3. Explain the proposed use and state the conditions of use, so that the copyright pro-
          prietor or agent need only give affirmative consent to the proposed use.
          12.1.3.4. Be submitted in duplicate to the copyright proprietor.
          12.1.3.5. Or so that the proprietor may retain one copy and return the other copy signed to evi-
          dence assent to the request.
          12.1.3.6. Include a self-addressed return envelope.
   12.2. When requesting permission to use copyrighted material, without cost, for use by the Academy
   in the support of its mission, Academy personnel should not require:
10                                                                  USAFAI51-303 22 NOVEMBER 2006


        12.2.1. A signature by more than one corporate officer of the corporation that owns the copyright,
        12.2.2. A raised corporate seal or certificate, or
        12.2.3. More than one copy of the signed permission or license.

13. Fair Use.
     13.1. Copyrighted material can be used without paying a license fee or without permission when the
     use would stimulate productive thought and public instruction without excessively reducing the incen-
     tives of individuals to be creative. This use, however, must be "fair" and the factors listed below are
     considered in determining whether or not the intended use is fair. Note: a "fair use" determination is a
     legal analysis that is highly fact-specific and strictly based upon the facts of each individual situation.
     Only your supporting legal office should conduct this examination.
        13.1.1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial
        nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
        13.1.2. The nature of the copyright work;
        13.1.3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a
        whole; and
        13.1.4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
     13.2. The factors referenced in paragraph 13.1. above are not to be treated in isolation, but are to be
     treated together. No one single factor is dispositive. Consideration in evaluating these factors include:
        13.2.1. Whether the use will be used to generate a profit.
            13.2.1.1. It is not appropriate to use copyrighted material where the purpose is to generate a
            profit.
        13.2.2. Whether the use is limited to a discrete and limited audience within the government.
            13.2.2.1. If the use is for a classroom and not for general use, that factor supports a finding of
            "fair use."
        13.2.3. Whether the use is planned or spontaneous.
            13.2.3.1. If the use is part of a planned curriculum or a spontaneous handout. If the use is
            spontaneous, it supports a finding of "fair use."
        13.2.4. Whether the original expression of the copyrighted material is used, or only the facts or
        ideas contained with the material is used.
            13.2.4.1. In no event does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to
            any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery.
     13.3. If there is a question regarding the "fair use" of copyrighted material; the proposed use should
     be reviewed by the legal office that provides support to the organization proposing the use.
     13.4. A copy of each license, assignment or release purchased by USAFA, or any permission (license)
     obtained without charge, shall be maintained by the purchaser for 6 years. A copy of licenses, assign-
     ments or releases totaling over $2,500 shall be forwarded to Office of the General Counsel, Acquisi-
     tions (SAF/GCQ).
USAFAI51-303 22 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                           11


   13.5. Note that other defenses from unauthorized copyright use may be found in 17 U.S.C. 110. Your
   supporting legal office should make the decision regarding the applicability of these defenses.

14. Infringement Claims and Litigation.
   14.1. The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) coordinates and controls all claims and infringement
   actions concerning copyrights. The Commercial Litigation Division, Air Force Legal Services
   Agency (AFLOA/JACN) is the organization responsible for the investigative handling and adminis-
   trative determinations of all such intellectual property infringement claims and litigation, including
   appeals of determination of rights, for TJAG.
   14.2. A copyright owner who believes that his or her copyright has been infringed by the Air Force,
   prior to filing suit against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims, may file an
   administrative claim before the Air Force pursuant to Title 10 United States Code, Section 2386,
   Copyrights, Patents, Designs, Etc.; Acquisition, for compensation for any liability arising under Title
   28 United States Code, Section 1498(a) or (b), Patent and Copyright Cases, Title 17 United States
   Code, Section 504, Remedies for Infringement: Damages and Profits, Title 35 United States Code,

   nical Information.
   14.3. Claims settlement authority may be re-delegated for settlement amounts not exceeding
   $100,000. The Secretary has delegated authority to settle claims pertaining to intellectual property
   matters under the above cited authority (see paragraph 13.) to TJAG. Consistent with that delegation,
   the Secretary has designated TJAG as the organization that represents the Air Force in all civil litiga-
   tion, and that takes all actions necessary to protect the Air Force when its interests may be affected.
   The Intellectual Property Branch, Commercial Litigation Division, Air Force Legal Services Agency
   (AFLOA/JACN-P), with the assistance of the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Air Force Materiel
   Command, (AFMC/JA) as requested, directs those activities pertaining to intellectual property law
   matters.
   14.4. AFLOA/JACN-P, with assistance from AFMC as requested, will investigate each claim for
   copyright infringement filed before the Air Force that complies with the requirements of Defense Fed-
   eral Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFAR) Part 227, Subpart 227.70, Infringement Claims,
   Licenses, and Assignments, for docketing a claim and take all necessary steps to settle administra-
   tively, deny, or otherwise dispose of the claim prior to suit against the United States.
   14.5. Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Headquarters United States Air Force Academy
   (HQ USAFA/JA) shall forward under cover letter directly to AFLOA/JACN-P each communication
   asserting or believed to assert a claim of copyright infringement. Forward communications which:
      14.5.1. Allege or assert that the Air Force has improperly copied, prepared a derivative work, dis-
      tributed, performed, displayed, or transmitted any work of authorship owned by another.
      14.5.2. Request, either expressly or implicitly, compensation because of use.
      14.5.3. Offer to grant an assignment of a copyright or a license for its use.
      14.5.4. Request that alleged unauthorized use by or for the government cease.
      14.5.5. The Air Force activity must state all pertinent facts concerning the claim or allegation that
      are known, and provide AFLOA/JACN-P with all pertinent documentation.
12                                                                 USAFAI51-303 22 NOVEMBER 2006


     14.6. Suits for Copyright Infringement--Employees
        14.6.1. An employee may bring suit against the United States in the United States Court of Fed-
        eral Claims under 28 U.S.C. 1498(a) or (b) for copyright infringement, except where:
            14.6.1.1. The employee was in a position to order, influence, or induce use of the work of
            authorship by the government.
            14.6.1.2. The work of authorship was related to the official functions of the employee; or
            14.6.1.3. Government time, materials, or facilities were used in making or preparing the work
