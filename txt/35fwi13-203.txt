2. R-130 Air-To-Ground and M203 Training Range
   2.1. General: R-130 (Draughon Range) and associated airspace is a Class A, joint use air-
   to-ground training range, located 10 NM north of Misawa Air Base. The land area is
   approximately 1900 acre semi-circle, one statute mile in radius, from a focal point at
   N4051.146/E14123.034 (WGS-84). The entire eastern edge of Draughon Range borders the
   Pacific Ocean. The northern sea area boundary is a line drawn 058 degrees true from the
   northern tip of the land area. The southern sea area boundary is a line drawn 108 degrees
   true from the southern tip of the land area. Draughon extends to the east by a 5 statute mile
   arc from the focal point (See Attachment 1).
   2.2. Range Configuration (See Attachment 3.1): Range configuration is updated as
   required for local training use. Updates to the current range configuration, locations, and
   Weapons Danger Zone (WDZ) data can be obtained through 35 OSS/OSK (DSN 226-3187).
      2.2.1. Range Towers: North flank tower (N4052.887/E14123.330), located NE of main
      tower, will not be manned by contractor personnel when winds are 30 knots steady state
6                                                               35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014


    or gusting at 35 knots or greater. Also, manual scores cannot be given under this
    condition. The main control tower (N4052.083/E14122.745) is rated at 66 knots.
    2.2.2. Conventional Target: Consists of a bulls eye with concentric circles at 75 feet
    (22.86 meters) and 150 feet (45.72 meters) centered on the target (normally a shipping
    container, sea box, or conex van). It is located 4,030 feet (1228.34 meters) east/northeast
    of the main tower. Target coordinates are N 4052.271 E 14123.596 (WGS-84), elevation
    is approximately 16 feet. Due to accidental 20MM HEI firing on this target, it is a danger
    zone requiring additional safety measures by EOD. Reference Attachment 8, Proposed
    Procedures for Scraping Conventional Target, dated 28 June 2010, for more information.
    Also reference Attachment 9, Risk Assessment for Draughon Range, dated 21 June 2010.
    2.2.3. 20MM HEI UXO Target: Consists of two orange sea containers aligned next to
    each other. The target is for High Angle Strafe with HEI ammunition only. Low angle
    strafe is not authorized on this target. Target coordinates are N4052.504 & E14123.469.
    Current target location prevents EOD from conducting decontamination procedures.
    Unexploded 20MM HEI remain in the danger zone and ORM dictates only qualified
    EOD technicians or personnel escorted by EOD enter the target area. Reference
    Attachment 9, Risk Assessment for Draughon Range, dated 21 June 2010, for more
    information.
    2.2.4. JASDF (Rocket) Target: Located northeast of the conventional target. US forces
    are not authorized to employ any type of munitions on the JASDF target.
    2.2.5. Low/High Angle Strafe (LAS/HAS) Targets: Panels 1 and 2 are designated for
    low angle strafe. Panel 4 is designated for high angle strafe only. Panel 3 is not used.
    All strafe panels have a 2,000' foul line, identified by a line of orange barrels abeam the
    main tower. Strafe panels will not be available when steady state winds are greater than
    20 knots or gusting greater than 25 knots.
    2.2.6. Tactical Targets: Trucks, conex vans, simulated anti-aircraft guns, tracking
    devices, and aircraft comprise the tactical target area east of the strafe targets. Contact 35
    OSS/OSK for current range configuration and coordinates.
       2.2.6.1. High angle strafe is permitted on the center tactical targets, but electronic
       scoring is not available. RCOs will give general information based on visual impact.
       The puppy paws will not be targeted for strafe.
       2.2.6.2. LAS is permitted on the tactical target array only from dry passes under
       flight lead control. Soil surrounding the tactical target array is not maintained
       appropriately for any hot LAS; ricochets from hot passes on the tactical target array
       could impact the delivering aircraft. This restriction does not apply to helicopter gun
       employment; helicopters may employ hot gun passes from low angle on the tactical
       target array in accordance with restrictions in Para. 2.8.3.2.
    2.2.7. Electronic Combat Range Equipment. A RWR light emitter is also located in the
    mobile van.
       2.2.7.1. RWR Light: The RWR light is a 9 GHz emitter.
35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                    7


  2.3. Range Restrictions (see Attachment 2 and Attachment 4): Pilots will use the most
  restrictive range procedures, weather minimums, and emergency procedures found in flight
  regulations and range regulations for the aircraft employing on Draughon Range.
     2.3.1. Airspace: Draughon Range is located within the Misawa Positive Control Area
     (PCA) (2,000’AGL to FL230, bounded by coordinates N4059.17, E14107.28; N4059.17,
     E14120.78; N4053.17, E14129.78, N4051.08, E14130.00; N4049.17, E14124.78;
     N4049.17, E14107.28; to beginning. See Attachment 4). Misawa Approach Control or
     Sapporo Area Control Center must clear flights into the PCA. R-130 (with Misawa PCA)
     is available from the surface to 20,000 feet MSL during scheduled range periods.
     Airspace to 23,000 feet is available on request through Sapporo Area Control Center
     (UHF 279.2/VHF 119.3); pilots must request the airspace to 23,000 from Sapporo Area
     Control Center.
         2.3.1.1. Aircraft must be cleared into the Draughon PCA through RAPCON. Aircraft
         must be cleared into Draughon Range airspace (R-130) by the RCO.
     2.3.2. Danger Areas (See Attachment 2): Danger areas extend from the northern sea
     boundary to the southern sea boundary in a 2-mile arc for training rounds (e.g. BDU-33)
     and a 3-mile arc for inert heavy-weight ordnance. Boats and other watercraft are advised
     to avoid these areas when Draughon is “Hot.” Pilots will not drop ordnance on Draughon
     when boats or other watercraft are within the described danger area arcs, however, dry
     passes are authorized.
     2.3.3. No-Fly Areas (See Attachment 4): Over flight of the Draughon Range main tower
     (N4052.42/E14123.39), north flank tower (N4052.43/E14123.33), and the Rokkasho
     nuclear power plant north of Draughon Range (N4058.5/E14121.0) is prohibited. The
     blue-roofed farms to the west of Draughon Range (N4054.08/E14119.03) and the piers to
     the northeast of the target (N4055.56/E14123.76) may not be overflown at low altitude.
     2.3.4. Deliveries: All Deliveries will be IAW Attachment 3.2. Loft and toss deliveries
     are limited to +10 degrees nose high when “Hot” on Draughon Range. Weapons should
     be armed “Hot” over water when possible. All ordnance must be released to impact
     within the range boundary. First run attacks are authorized given the flight has
     previously coordinated with the RCO, is in radio contact with the RCO, and no boats or
     watercraft are in the danger area. Dry passes and simulated attacks may be accomplished
     from any attack axis provided they do not overfly the no-fly areas.
     2.3.5. Weather:
         2.3.5.1. Day Conventional: Ceiling must be 500 feet above the highest portion of the
         bombing pattern and 3nm of visibility with a discernable horizon. Ordnance will not
         be dropped or fired through overcast conditions. For dry loft/toss deliveries, pull-up
         through overcast conditions is prohibited. Local Misawa altimeter will be used unless
         updated by Draughon Tower. Helicopter minimums will be IAW weapons system
         and applicable instructions.
     2.3.6. Ordnance And Pyrotechnics Authorized: Authorized ordnance and pyrotechnics
     include 20mm//5.56mm/7.62mm/50 cal target practice and tracer rounds, rockets
     equipped with inert warheads or spotting charge, and inert free-fall (i.e. non PGM) bombs
     not to exceed 2,000 pounds. Chaff and flares are prohibited within the R130 airspace.
8                                                                35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014


       Expenditure of heavyweight inert ordnance (MK-82 to MK-84 class ordnance) is only
       authorized on the tactical target array. Dry passes may be accomplished simulating any
       munition as long as the munitions are mechanically safe, cannot be released from the
       aircraft, and that the passes do not overfly no-fly areas. Authorized deliveries will be
       IAW Attachment 3.2.
           2.3.6.1. Any high-drag weapon delivered low-drag must be hard-wired low-drag.
       2.3.7. Number of Aircraft: There will be a maximum of four aircraft in the day
       conventional pattern. With RCO and flight lead coordination, additional aircraft may be
       in the PCA and/or on Draughon Range and will be positively de-conflicted from each
       additional flight.
    2.4. Range Holding/Entry:
       2.4.1. Holding (See Attachment 5): Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) holding is
       on the MIS 320/20, left hand turns, 10nm legs at 3500’ (over Mutsu Bay north of
       Noheji). If unable to hold VMC, contact Misawa RAPCON on UHF 317.8 for clearance
       to hold in IMC with a block altitude.
       2.4.2. Deconfliction: In order to de-conflict range entries and departures, entering flights
       will remain at or below 3000' MSL until “feet dry” inbound (east shore of Mutsu Bay)
       and westbound departing flights will exit above 4000' MSL. If flights departing the range
       westbound are unable to climb above 4000' MSL under VMC, they will deconflict their
       departure with flights holding for range entry on range frequency. Reference Area
       Planning (AP/3) for complete information on Misawa PCA.
       2.4.3. Entry: Clearance must be obtained from the RCO prior to entry onto Draughon
       Range.
           2.4.3.1. Minimum altitude for a spacer pass is 500' AGL. Range entry from the east
           direct to downwind is permitted, provided no aircraft are on the range. A tactical
           entry to a hot-delivery on either the conventional or tactical targets requires RCO
           approval and must be performed under guidance in Para. 2.3.4., as applicable.
           2.4.3.2. Helicopters are authorized to enter Draughon Range airspace from any
           direction. Entry direction will be cleared with the RCO prior to entry to de-conflict
           with scheduled fixed wing range periods. Helicopters will complete a clearing pass
           along and over the range boundaries before live fire operations.
       2.4.4. Exit: Prior to departing Draughon airspace, pilots must contact Misawa Approach.
       Once identified by Misawa approach and recovering to Misawa, fly heading 100º (Rwy
       28)/ 280º (Rwy 10) prior to switching to Misawa Tower. Use caution for numerous
       aircraft operating in Misawa’s VFR and IFR traffic patterns; downwind for both of these
       patterns is approximately 5 nautical miles south of the Draughon PCA. Aircraft exiting
       Draughon Range but not recovering at Misawa should hold in Draughon airspace until
       Misawa Approach has provided departure/clearance instructions and traffic advisories as
       necessary.
    2.5. Hours of Operation: Draughon Range normal operating hours are 0700 to 2000
    Monday through Friday (local time). Weekend and U.S. Federal holiday use is by exception
35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                  9


  only and requires 35 FW/CC and 35 CONS approval to ensure contractual obligations are not
  violated.
     2.5.1. Extended Hours: Extended hours to 2200 local time during the months of April–
     September for a maximum of 15 days per month and a maximum total of 60 days over
     the six month period, are available upon request from 35 OSS/OSOS and must be
     requested a minimum of 20 days in advance. During extended hours, the range will be
     open from either: 0800-2100, or 0900-2200. If the range is to be used between 2000 and
     2200 local, 35 OSS/OSOS will notify 35 FW/PA, who will then notify the local Defense
     Facilities Administration Office (DFAO), NLT 15 days in advance of intended use. As
     an absolute minimum in unforeseen circumstances, a 5-day prior notification of DFAO is
     required.
  2.6. Scheduling:
     2.6.1. Authority: 35 OSS/OSOS is the only scheduling authority for Draughon Range
     usage. All ground or airborne use of Draughon Range for training requires at least 48
     hours prior notice for approval unless further lead time is required per the guidance in
     para. 2.5.1.
     2.6.2. Requests: 35 FW squadrons should submit their biweekly Draughon Range
     requests NLT the close of business on the Thursday preceding the upcoming range
     deconfliction meeting outlined in para 2.6.3.
     2.6.3. Deconfliction Meetings: De-confliction meetings occur weekly on Tuesday at
     1300 and cover a two week scheduling period. 35 FW squadrons have priority for the
     first week and JASDF has priority for the second week of each two-week period.
     2.6.4. Naval Scheduling: Aircraft departing from aircraft carriers will submit range
     airspace requests no later than 1200 the day prior to use. Navy and Marine requests for,
     and changes to, the range schedule will be made through Naval Air Facility Flight
     Support, then forwarded to 35 OSS/OSOS.
     2.6.5. Cancellations: All cancellations must be made at least 24 hours prior to the
     scheduled range time. Changes, additions, or deletions to the range schedule will be
     forwarded to 35 OSS/OSOS, who will notify range personnel of all changes to the
     schedule. USFJ will contact 35 OSS/OSOR directly if unable to notify 35 OSS/OSOS.
     2.6.6. Range Cleanup: During scheduled range maintenance and EOD cleanup, adhere
     to the restrictions below. Electronic warfare emitters on Draughon Range property will
     not emit while EOD operations are actively being conducted.
         2.6.6.1. Overflight Procedures: Overflight is not authorized without the concurrence
         of the ground party and RCO/ROO approval over areas or portions of ranges during
         maintenance and clearance operations. This ensures the protection of ground
         personnel and prevents aircraft damage by fragments from explosives operations.
         Strict adherence to the procedures outlined below is mandatory.
         2.6.6.2. When range maintenance or clearance personnel are present on the range and
         explosives operations are not planned, aircraft will remain at or above 3,000’ AGL
         unless a lower altitude is specifically approved by the ground party and RCO/ROO.
10                                                               35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014


         2.6.6.3. When explosives operations are planned, aircraft will remain at or above
         7,000’ AGL to ensure containment of H-6 fill Mk-84 fragmentation.
         2.6.6.4. When no personnel are on the range but the range is closed for maintenance
         or clearance operations, aircraft operations may proceed with no additional altitude
         restrictions. Only simulated weapons deliveries are allowed IAW applicable
         directives. Eye safe laser operations are authorized during range clearance closures.
         All restrictions will be clearly identified in the range schedule.
     2.6.7. Bootlegging: During daily range operations flights may “bootleg” range airspace
     if no other flight is currently on range. A “bootlegging” flight must exit range airspace
     when any scheduled flight checks in with Draughon Range.
  2.7. Communications:
     2.7.1. Conventional Range: Primary frequency is UHF 365.4. Secondary frequency is
     VHF 139.2. Emergency frequency is UHF 243.0. Voice call sign is “DRAUGHON
     TOWER.” Two-way communications with Draughon Tower must be established prior to
     entering R-130 airspace.
     2.7.2. Joint Advanced Weapons Scoring Systems (JAWSS):
         2.7.2.1. All range missions will be recorded and scored with Improved Remote Strafe
         Scoring System (IRSSS) and/or Weapons Impact Scoring Set (WISS).
            2.7.2.1.1. IRSSS target summary data will be emailed/faxed to the flight lead or
            represented squadron. A detailed report containing each scored pass can be
            obtained on request.
            2.7.2.1.2. WISS system target summary data will be emailed/faxed to the flight
            lead or represented squadron. A detailed report can be obtained on request.
  2.8. Procedures: The following procedures apply to all training on Draughon Range.
     2.8.1. Manning: An RCO and two range technicians are required for all scheduled Class
     A conventional operations. Electronic Warfare operations require an RCO for voice
     communications and one Electronic Warfare Technician per emitter to be used.
     2.8.2. Operational Communications: If an RCO pre-briefing has not been accomplished,
     the flight lead will check in with call sign, tail numbers, and planned events. The range
     pre-brief should also include ordnance to be used, type of attack, and number of releases
     per aircraft per pass, as well as targets to be used. Aircraft will make voice reports in
     accordance with applicable regulations. Generally, these reports will indicate the
     aircraft’s pattern, position, intention, and armament system status (safe/armed).
     2.8.3. Patterns (See Attachment 5):
         2.8.3.1. Curvilinear And Pop Patterns: Left-hand turns remaining clear of populated
         areas. To preclude inadvertent releases, pilots will minimize time with a hot pickle
         button/trigger to the maximum extent possible. Do not select CCIP/strafe sub-modes
         until just prior to initiating roll-in to final. Delay as long as practical based on target
         ID, delivery, and pilot technique. Pilots are authorized right-hand wheel patterns for
         CAS training following coordination and clearance from the RCO.
35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                       11


        2.8.3.2. Strafe: Aircraft executing live low angle strafe (less than or equal to 15
        degrees) runs on the scoreable strafe targets will pass across the fluorescent orange
        run-in tires located on the range boundary. Any fighter/attack aircraft that ejects
        expended cartridges/links will use a minimum dive angle of 12 degrees for LAS and
        will delay firing until passing the first pair of tires to ensure all spent cartridges fall
        within the confines of Draughon Range. Strafe pits 1 and 2 are designated for LAS
        only. Strafe pit 3 will not be used and strafe pit 4 is designated for High Angle Strafe
        (greater than 15 degrees) only. Pilots/crews will ensure that guns/cannons are pointed
        away from inhabited areas prior to selecting Gun/Master Arm or mechanically arming
        guns/cannons. Pilots are authorized right-hand patterns following coordination and
        clearance from the RCO. Helicopter strafe passes on the scoreable strafe lanes must
        comply with all LAS restrictions except the 12 degree minimum dive angle and
        minimum cease fire ranges. Helicoptor LAS on the tactical target array is permitted
        as long as the gun-to-target line is between and including 085 to 105 degrees
        magnetic.
            2.8.3.2.1. Live low angle strafe will not be conducted while Combat Survival
            Training is taking place in the woods.
     2.8.4. Recoveries/Safe Escape: Pilots will accomplish the appropriate safe escape
     maneuver for the event attempted and specific aircraft.
     2.8.5. Hung Ordnance Procedures (See Attachment 5): Fly the hung ordnance pattern at
     1300 feet MSL until on base leg.
        2.8.5.1. Aborting a Pass: Pilots aborting a “hot” pass will state reason after
        completing safe escape maneuver to preclude any false hung bomb actions.
        2.8.5.2. No Spots: If the RCO calls a “no spot,” the aircraft attempting to drop must
        remain over water and attempt to visually confirm bomb status. If overland when
        notified of a “no spot,” avoid populated areas and proceed over water.
        2.8.5.3. If the bomb cannot be visually confirmed as expended or secure, consult the
        Misawa Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and the 35 FW Pilot’s Guide and consider either
        jettisoning the hung bomb IAW para. 2.8.5.4 and/or ceasing further deliveries and
        flying the Misawa Air Base hung ordnance pattern. Aircraft may continue to drop if
        the hung bomb condition is resolved. Aircraft with hung ordnance shall inform the
        RCO and the SOF of intentions and contact Misawa Radar to report hung ordnance
        before leaving range airspace.
        2.8.5.4. Jettison Area: Located over water within the confines of R-130 or beyond
        12 NM from shore (international waters) below 5000’AGL. Clear the surface area for
        boats and watercraft before jettison.
            2.8.5.4.1. Jettison Notification Procedures: The pilot shall inform Misawa
            RAPCON (UHF 317.8) of the intent to use the jettison area. Radar vectors or
            flight-following to the area shall be provided by RAPCON on request. RAPCON
            shall not tell the pilot when to jettison.
            2.8.5.4.2. Jettison Procedures: Aircrews shall depart MIS TACAN 360 radial at
            10 DME at 2,000’AGL (or assigned) on a heading of 090°. 35 FW pilots will
12                                                              35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014


            refer to the Selective-Jettison procedures in T.O. 1F-16CM-CL-1.
         2.8.5.5. Hung Bombs: With no other malfunctions, hung practice bombs (e.g. BDU-
         33) do not constitute an emergency. Hung inert heavyweight ordnance and
         hung/jammed guns do constitute an emergency and will be handled accordingly.
         2.8.5.6. Hung Bomb Route: Hold “feet wet” and contact the Misawa Supervisor of
         Flying (SOF, Callsign “Cardinal,” VHF 140.7 or UHF 283.3) prior to RTB. Execute
         a Hung Ordnance Recovery. Fly the routing depicted in Attachment 5 when VMC at
         1,600’ and avoid populated areas to the maximum extent possible. For Rwy 10
         recoveries, proceed SW over Lake Ogawara and enter a left base outside the
         “Elephant Cage” for a straight-in landing. Avoid the “Elephant Cage” 1 mile to the
         northwest of Misawa. For Rwy 28, remain over the ocean and recover to a straight-in
         landing. If IMC, declare hung ordnance and follow Misawa RAPCON vectors.
         Advise controllers to attempt to keep you clear of populated areas to the maximum
         extent possible.
     2.8.6. Unintentional/Inadvertent Release: Every effort shall be made to account for all
     ordnance delivered.
         2.8.6.1. Pilot Actions: Pilots shall immediately report any incident involving actual
         or possible off-range releases (inadvertent or unintentional) to the RCO. Pilots will
         attempt to mark the spot of the release and the probable impact area.
         2.8.6.2. RCO Actions: When notified of a possible off-range release, including a
         planned or emergency jettison, the RCO shall perform emergency checklist
         procedures and will immediately relay all pertinent information to the SOF and 35
         FW Command Post (35 FW/CP). The RCO will relay information to 35 OG/CC as
         soon as possible. Command Post will notify the proper authorities immediately.
         Additionally, RCOs will notify the 35 FW/CP of on-range releases resulting in injury
         or damage to equipment and property.
  2.9. Night Range Procedures: Night operations are defined as the time from official sunset
  to sunrise. All day rules apply to night operations as well as the following restrictions.
     2.9.1. Night Weather: Minimum night visibility is 5nm. Helicopters are exempt from
     altitude, angle and safe escape restrictions and require only 2nm visibility.
     2.9.2. Non-Night System Equipped Aircaft: Maximum of 3 aircraft may be in the
     conventional range pattern.
         2.9.2.1. Patterns: Patterns will be a rectangular box or standard radar pattern.
         Minimum altitude for night operations is 1500’ AGL (Draughon Range MSA).
         Minimum spacing is 60 seconds between deliveries. Pilots will drop only on the
         conventional target. Max planned dive angle is 45 degrees. Minimum recovery
         altitudes for dive angles are 4500’ AGL >35 degrees, 2000’AGL 20-35 degrees,
         1000’AGL <20 degrees. Pilots will accomplish climbing safe escape maneuvers.
         Pilots will not attempt to air score their bombs. Night strafe (hot or dry passes) is not
         authorized. Normally, flights should rejoin over the range due to the lack of horizon
         references to the east (over the ocean). Night rejoins should be above 3500’ MSL,
         weather permitting. Minimum airspeed for dry loft passes is 300 KIAS.
35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                      13


         2.9.2.2. Lighting (See Attachment 3): Non-night system equipped aircraft will not
         drop without operational overt lighting. Pilots will ensure the target is positively
         identified prior to release. Pilots will ensure position lights are fully illuminated and
         strobes/ beacons are on.
            2.9.2.2.1. Floodlights are positioned at the 5, 6, and 7 o’clock position outside the
            outer circle of the conventional target and are aimed at the conventional target.
            The total length of the run-in lights is 2100 feet; all lights do not need to be
            operational but enough must be operational to ensure aircrew have a clear run-in
            line to the conventional circle. The RCO has final judgment concerning the
            appropriate number of functional run-in lights.
     2.9.3. Night System Equipped Aircraft: Night systems are defined as Night Vision
     Goggles (NVG), LANTIRN/LITENING/SNIPER, or NAV FLIR/ATFLIR; infrared
     Maverick alone does not constitute a night system. Aircraft equipped with night systems
     will follow non-night system rules while on the range at night with the following
     exceptions:
         2.9.3.1. Maximum Number of Aircraft: Maximum of 4 aircraft may be in the
         conventional pattern. With RCO and flight lead coordination, additional aircraft may
         be in the PCA and/or range with positive de-confliction from each additional flight.
         2.9.3.2. Lighting: No artificial illumination is required of the target area; however
         pilots will ensure they are able to positively identify the target prior to weapons
         release. External lighting will be sufficient to allow the RCO to track all flight
         members within the pattern. The RCO has the authority to direct which lights aircraft
         will use while on range. All aircraft on range shall mimic light settings as directed by
         the RCO.
         2.9.3.3. Patterns: Minimum spacing is the same as day procedures. The tactical
         target array is available for use at night. Scoring can be accomplished if munitions
         contain a spotting charge. LANTIRN/LITENING/SNIPER aircraft will not go below
         altitudes specified in MAJCOM/MDS regulations.
         2.9.3.4. Strafe: High angle strafe is authorized only for fixed wing aircraft on the
         center tactical target array. Helicopters may low angle strafe on the tactical target
         array (firing eastbound IAW para. 2.8.3.2.).
            2.9.3.4.1. High angle strafe is also allowed on the HEI HAS target. (HEI only- no
            TP rounds authorized).
  2.10. Laser And IR Marker Operating Procedures. All laser and IR marker procedures at
  Draughon range are IAW AFOSH Standard 48-139 (which imitate those of the American
  National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z136.1, American National Standard for Safe use of
  Lasers), AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, and AFI 13-212. (Note: IAW
  AFI 11-214 the use of the “combat” laser mode of a laser designator is restricted to laser
  certified ranges. Off-range laser emissions are not authorized unless in the “eye-safe”
  training frequency).
     2.10.1. Range Personnel:
14                                                           35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014


        2.10.1.1. IAW AFI 13-212, range personnel will have a baseline eye exam before
        working in the laser hazard environment.
        2.10.1.2. IAW AFI 13-212, during laser operations, all range personnel in the Laser
        Surface Danger Zone (LSDZ) will wear laser eye protection of appropriate optical
        density. The current Consultative Letter authorizes laser eye protection for range
        personnel.
        2.10.1.3. Lasers will not be operated without the approval of the Laser Safety Officer
        (LSO) and the RCO.
        2.10.1.4. If standing water is present in the LTA, all personnel observing operations
        shall wear laser eye protection appropriate to the system specification requirements

           environmental suitability for employment of lasers, and ensure the Laser Surface
           Danger Zone (LSDZ) is clear of personnel. Additionally, the LSO will advise the
           user if there is standing water present in the laser target areas.
           2.10.2.4.4. General Restrictions:
               2.10.2.4.4.1. Users should comply with Joint Pub 3-09.1 and Joint Pub 3-09.3
               on procedures for laser designation and close air support (CAS).
               2.10.2.4.4.2. Calculations used to determine allowed buffer angles and
               LSDZs assumes ocean waterways, out to three miles, are free of vessels due
               east of the range coastline. Therefore, range personnel and users must take all
               reasonable precautions to ensure that the ocean waterways (as described) are
               clear of vessels prior to employing airborne non eye-safe lasers.
               2.10.2.4.4.3. Laser operations must immediately cease if unauthorized
               personnel are observed in the LSDZ, vessels are determined to be within 3
               miles of the coastline, equipment malfunction is observed, target is lost in
               FOV, or any time laser safety cannot be assured.

                 granted clearance for combat laser on your target set.
                 2.10.2.4.5.1.2. All headings are available (0-360 degrees).
                 2.10.2.4.5.1.3. Lasing above 23,000’ AGL or below 1,000’ AGL is not
                 authorized.
                 2.10.2.4.5.1.4. Ensure the lasing aircraft sets a hard altitude while in the
                 wheel and stays inside the max orbit distance listed in Attachment 7.
     2.10.3. IR Pointer (“Marker”) Employment: IR pointers referenced in this section are
     laser command pointers (LCPs) (ACP-2A/2B, GCP-1A/1B/1C, LP-1000, IZLID 100P-
     A1), ATPs (LITENING,SNIPER XR), and MTS (MQ-1/9). For simplicity, a reference to
     “IR pointer” is a reference to all devices previously listed.
        2.10.3.1. IAW 11-214, Laser Eye Protection (LEP) with side protection must be
        worn when employing a LCP in the cockpit, where a reflection hazard exists, or
        during a ground test.
        2.10.3.2. IAW 11-214, aircrew will notify ground personnel and other aircraft in the
        working area prior to employing IR pointer. When required, ground personnel will
        ensure proper eye protection is in place.
        2.10.3.3. Minimum Aircraft To Aircraft Slant Ranges: IAW 11-214, fixed-wing
        aircraft will adhere to the following minimum slant range separation between IR
        pointer employing aircraft and other aircraft (assumes no LEPs and no magnifying
        devices are being used in other aircraft). 1,000 feet slant range for LCP (ACP-2A/2B,
16                                                            35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014

        ATP. 3,000 feet slant range for LCP (GCP-1C, LP-1000, IZLID 1000P-A1).
        2.10.3.4. Minimum Employment Altitudes And Slant Ranges: IAW 11-214, if all
        personnel in the area to be designated are wearing LEPs, the minimum IR pointer
        employment altitude is 1,000 feet AGL for fixed-wing aircraft. In this case, there is
        no minimum altitude for rotary-wing aircraft LCP employment provided the LCP is
        not pointed toward any aircraft, person or specular surface (i.e. water, glass, mirrors,
        reflecting surfaces, etc.).
           2.10.3.4.1. IAW 11-214, if non-LEP equipped personnel are in the area to be
           designated and it is verified that no image-magnifying devices (binoculars,
           telescopes, etc.) are in use, minimum IR pointer employment slant range is 3,000
           feet. If slant range cannot be determined the minimum employment altitude is
           3,000 feet AGL.
           2.10.3.4.2. IAW 11-214, if non-LEP equipped personnel are in the area to be
           designated and unable to ensure the absence of personnel using image-magnifying
           devices (binoculars, telescopes, etc.) in the area to be designated, IR pointer
           employment is restricted as follows:
               2.10.3.4.2.1. LCP (ACP-2A/2B, GCP-1A) and LITENING ATP. The
               minimum slant range is 10,000 feet. If slant range cannot be determined the
               minimum employment altitude is 10,000 feet AGL.
               2.10.3.4.2.2. MTS. The minimum slant range is 14,000 feet. If slant range
               cannot be determined the minimum employment altitude is 14,000 feet AGL.
               2.10.3.4.2.3. Sniper XR ATP. The minimum slant range is 24,000 feet. If
               slant range cannot be determined the minimum employment altitude is 24,000
               AGL.
        2.10.3.5. IAW 11-214, aircrew will make an “IR Pointer Safe” call when IR pointer
        use is terminated for the mission and the safety cap (handheld LCP only) is in place.
     2.10.4. Laser Safety And Reporting: IAW AFOSHSTD 48-139, every incident
     involving a suspected laser radiation exposure to personnel covered by AFOSHSTD 48-
     139 (e.g. military and DoD civilian personnel) will be investigated and documented.
     (NOTE: Aircrew who receive a laser exposure from either friendly or hostile sources
     should immediately report to the Flight Surgeon’s Office (FSO). The FSO will manage
     and coordinate the event with the MAJCOM, USAFSAM/AFC, 311 HSW/YA and AFRL
     as appropriate).
        2.10.4.1. Individuals exposed will seek medical care, without delay, at their host
        medical unit emergency treatment facility. THE LASER HOTLINE (1-800-473-
        3549, this is a 24/7service number, please refer to local dialing procedures) SHOULD
        BE CALLED ASAP BECAUSE IMMEDIATE INDICATED CARE IS CRITICAL.
        The immediate supervisor will immediately notify the Unit Commander and Safety
        Officer or LSO and the Bioenvironmental Engineer. The Bioenvironmental Engineer
        will notify Wing Safety, Public Health services, Staff Judge Advocate, and MAJCOM
        medical staff immediately.
35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                     17


     2.10.5. No public releases of information concerning laser or IR Marker operations will
     be made without 35 OSS/OSK, 35 FW/PA, NAF Liaison, 35 FW/CC coordination, and
     USFJ/service-specific release authorities.
  2.11. Minimum Recovery Altitude: Users will comply with the applicable AFIs/NATOPS
  regulations but no lower than 75 feet AGL, whichever is higher.
  2.12. Aircraft Emergency and Radio Failure Procedures:
     2.12.1. Radio Failure (NORDO): The NORDO aircraft will safe all switches and should
     maintain pattern spacing. The NORDO aircraft will fly near the main tower, rocking its
     wings. On downwind, attempt contact on the Draughon Range back-up frequency. If
     contact is made, the RCO will have the rest of the flight switch to the back-up frequency.
     If radio contact is not made, remain VFR and fly 1000’ above the highest pattern briefed
     rocking wings on final. Fly straight through for each subsequent pass. Squawk 7600 and
     recover to Misawa. The RCO will notify Misawa RAPCON.
     2.12.2. Safety: All flight leads are responsible for the overall safe conduct of the flight.
     The RCO is responsible for ground safety, and acts as safety observer for all range
     operations. The flight lead should pay special attention for boats, which may be in the
     danger area offshore east of the range, or in the channel west of the range. The RCO will
     ensure all safety precautions contained in this supplement are adhered to and report any
     violation to the proper authorities in accordance with current regulations.
     2.12.3. The RCO may call “KNOCK IT OFF” at any time during missions for safety of
     flight.
     2.12.4. Aircraft Crashes: Range operations will be terminated by the RCO if an aircraft
     crashes on or near the range complex. The RCO will close the range and direct all
     aircraft to break out of the pattern. If the crash is in an inaccessible or unknown region,
     RESCAP aircraft may be requested to stay in the pattern, attempt to pinpoint the crash
     location, and provide assistance to direct rescue forces to the scene. Misawa RAPCON
     and Command Post will be contacted by the RCO with accident information.
     2.12.5. Controlled Bailout (See Attachment 6): Controlled bailout is over Draughon
     Range (MIS 360/10 or vectors from RAPCON if IMC) on an easterly heading at or above
     2000' MSL.
        2.12.5.1. Aircrew will notify SOF of intentions to proceed with controlled bailout.
        Following SOF notification, SOF and/or aircrew will notify Draughon Range RCO of
        intentions to proceed with controlled bailout.
        2.12.5.2. Following Range notification, the RCO will activate the EMERGENCY
        ACTION CHECKLIST.
  2.13. Ground Operations/Training:
     2.13.1. Combat Arms M203 Grenade Launcher Training Procedures:
        2.13.1.1. Only the approved location will be utilized for M203, Grenade Launcher
        Training (see Attachment 6).
        2.13.1.2. Security Forces will be responsible for scheduling Draughon Range times
        for M203, Grenade Launcher Training through 35 OSS/OSOS.
18                                                            35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014


        2.13.1.3. Security Forces will be responsible for environmental clean-up of the M203
        Grenade Launcher Training area to include all expended rounds as well as targets
        used during training.
        2.13.1.4. Security Forces will respond to all Range Control Officer’s/Safety Officer
        instructions/direction.
        2.13.1.5. CATM personnel will be trained as unescorted personnel for the safety of
        their trainees (see paragraph 1.7.1.2).
        2.13.1.6. Combat arms training other than M203 is not authorized on Draughon
        Range.
  2.14. C-130 Procedures (see Attachments 3 and 4):
     2.14.1. Establish a location for the drop zone with range management prior to the start of
     operations.
     2.14.2. Due to environmental conditions, alternate drop zone locations may be approved
     for operations by the RCO.
     2.14.2.1 It is the Airlift Squadron’s responsibility to retrieve loads. However, radios,
     weather data, and 4-wheel drive vehicle support can be coordinated with range personnel.
     Do not attempt to go beyond the Range Tower without a 4-wheel drive vehicle and
     familiarity with Draughon Range terrain.
        2.14.2.2. Use caution when retrieving loads. Bomb craters may make night retrieval
        difficult or dangerous.
        2.14.2.3. For night drops, loads should be marked with numerous lights to ensure
        recoverability.
        2.14.2.4. If any load, including Standard Airdrop Training Bundles (SATBs) impacts
        off Draughon Range, notify the RCO immediately. The RCO will notify the 35
        FW/CP, 374 AW/CP (225-2536), and the Mission Commander as soon as possible.
        Every effort will be made by the Combat Mobility Element (CME) team to retrieve
        all off-range drops. Results of the search will be forwarded to the Drop Zone Control
        Officer (DZCO) and range operations personnel. In the event of personal or property
        damage, loads will be undisturbed pending a mishap investigation.
            2.14.2.4.1. User accepts responsibility for damage to equipment and property.
        2.14.2.4.2 High winds are common at Draughon range. Aircrews must monitor
        winds closely to ensure airdrops are conducted within limits.
        2.14.2.5. Avoid Shimokita range located along the northeastern coast of Honshu.
        Altitudes vary but can be as high as FL230. This range is activated by Japanese class
        II NOTAMS and is not covered in the USAF NOTAM system.
35FWI13-203 30 APRIL 2014                                                                   19

     NOTE: Shimokita (Ground-to-Air, Ground-to-Ground Range) is operated by JASDF,
     normally during the summer months, between 0800-1700L. Contact Misawa Base
     Operations to determine if the range is active.

          2.14.2.6. Beware of the Draughon Range strafe targets, which look like Raised Angle
          Markers (RAMs).
      2.14.3. IMC Drop Altitude: Plan minimum IMC drop altitudes at 500 feet above the
      highest man-made obstacle or terrain feature and spot elevation, or 400 feet plus one
      basic contour interval above the highest depicted basic terrain contour, whichever is
      highest, within 3 NM either side of the run-in centerline from drop zone (DZ) entry point
      to DZ exit point. Use the operational minimum drop altitudes in AFI 11-231, Computed
      Air Release Point Procedures if higher. Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) drops and low
      level routes must comply with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exemption 4371C.
      2.14.4. IMC: Aircraft will be flown at least 2,000 feet (mountainous terrain) above the
      highest contour elevation, man-made obstacle, or spot elevation within 10 NM of route
      centerline. Airdrops will not be accomplished in IMC or through clouds. Aircrew must
      be visual with the entire drop zone.
          2.14.4.1. The computed air release point (CARP) should fall well east of the Range
          Tower and inside of R-130 for airdrops using the 070-110 degrees MC run-in. To
          avoid the possibility of airdrops on private property, do not drop if the CARP does
          not meet these criteria.
             2.14.4.1.1. DZ axis is limited to 070-110 degrees M and 250–290 degrees M
      2.14.5. Hung Load/Salvo Procedures (See Attachment 2): For 090 or 115 degrees run-
      ins, maintain drop altitude and DZ heading until over the ocean, for 270 degrees run-in,
      breakout and turn left, maneuver east of the coast over the water until ready to Salvo.
      Salvo over the water, within R-130, clear of any ships and notify the RCO prior to, and
      after SALVO procedures are accomplished.
