include current policies, requirements and to change the location of the AF RDS to the Air Force
Portal under AFRIMS. Paragraph 5.5.3. was changed to add alternate disposal sites and clean up
responsibilities. A new Paragraph 6 was added to include information about post emergency spill
response procedures. Attachment 2 was changed to add additional information for B3 engine
run to prevent jet blast damage to fleet facility; corrects F40 hazardous cargo classification to
bring this instruction in line with 62 AWI 91-4; removes road closure requirement for J-13;
corrects jacking locations; NOTE 1 was changed to add “full fuselage/integral”; and a new
NOTE 5 was added (the remaining NOTES were renumbered).


1. Aerospace Vehicle Parking Plan.
    1.1. General. Attachment 2 contains a listing of parking locations, primary users, principal
    aircraft, maximum weight, A/C jacking restrictions, engine run restrictions, deice restrictions,
    and allowances for hazardous cargo loading and unloading. Primary users are organizations
    that have a parking spot or spots assigned for their use. Aircraft assigned to those
    organizations will normally be parked on assigned spots. A principal aircraft is one that, due
    to aircraft size, weight, mission, support, or loading requirements is given first priority for a
    particular parking location.
    1.2. Responsibilities. The 62d Maintenance Operations Squadron (MOS) Maintenance
    Operations Center (MOC) will coordinate assignment of parking locations with aircraft
    maintenance unit (AMU) production supervisors or equivalent supervisors for the primary
    user. Coordination should include all affected agencies when an aircraft is parked on other
    than an assigned location. The 62 AW Weapons Safety Office (62 AW/SEW) will notify the
    MOC of any changes to licensing of parking locations for hazardous cargo.
    1.3. Aerospace Vehicle Parking: See Attachment 2
       1.3.1. Due to limited deice spots, approval of the AMXS Line Chief will be obtained
       prior to parking transient aircraft on Baker, Charlie, Joker, or Delta Ramps.
2. Towing and Ground Handling of Aircraft.
    2.1. Responsibilities. Tow supervisors must contact the MOC and the control tower for
    clearance prior to commencing an aircraft tow. Tow supervisors must monitor the control
    tower net throughout the entire tow operation. Tow supervisors will ensure aircraft being
    towed for hangaring are not loaded with flares.
       2.1.1. Towing of transient aircraft will be the responsibility of Transient Alert (TA)
       under guidance of the aircraft flight and/or ground crew. MOC and TA will establish 24-
       hour contact with the transient air/ground crew to expedite removal of aircraft from the
       hangar as soon as repairs are made.
    2.2. Procedures. Individual tow team members must wear reflective devices during
    nighttime tow operations or periods of limited visibility (less than 500 ft). Tow team
    members will carry two marshalling wands during nighttime tow operations.
       2.2.1. Tows being monitored and controlled by non-tactical radios will be limited to one
       in progress on the applicable radio net. If other tows are required at the same time,
       power-on tows are authorized as long as the Tow Supervisor, Tow Driver and
       Brake/Radio are able to communicate using the aircraft (ACFT) interphone system,
MCCHORDAFBI21-3 21 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               3


      except in and out of hangars. When hangaring aircraft, power-on tows can be utilized up
      to the tow vehicle stop line outside the hangar, then non-tactical radios will be used in
      accordance with the hangaring checklists. Each tow team member will use a whistle to
      indicate an emergency stop is needed. The same procedures apply to removing aircraft
      from the hangars.
      2.2.2. During tow operations proceeding on established taxiways, the tow supervisor has
      the option of riding in the tow vehicle when the vehicle has a passenger seat.
      2.2.3. During tows into hangars, the tow supervisors will strictly adhere to hangaring
      checklists.
      2.2.4. Prior to towing aircraft with inoperative brakes, approval must be obtained from
      the MXG/CC or designated representative (delegation below group deputy commander
      must be in writing).
          2.2.4.1. The tow supervisor will ensure that individuals are located at both main
          landing gears to chock walk during the tow. Communications must be maintained
          between the tow supervisor and chock walkers. Wing walkers will not be utilized as
          chock walkers.
   2.3. Towing Team Qualification. To be certified as a tow supervisor, personnel must remain
   qualified in the G081 information system for all subordinate tasks within the same function.
      2.3.1. Aircraft towing is a special certification requirement and requires an annual
      practical evaluation and certification for each position.
      2.3.2. The following minimum grade and skill levels apply by aircraft type:
          2.3.2.1. Tow supervisors will be 5-skill level, SSgt/WG-10 civilian, or higher. Air
          Reserve Technicians (ARTs) must be 5-level, SSgt/WG-10 civilian or higher. 62
          MXG/CC may waiver SSgt rank requirement and approve 5-level SrA to be tow
          supervisors.
          2.3.2.2. Tow vehicle operators must possess a valid AF Form 2293, US Air Force
          Motor Vehicle Operator Identification Card, with the type of tow vehicle in use listed
          on it.
3. Engine Ground Run Procedures.
   3.1. Quiet Hours Run Policy. Squadron commanders, maintenance officers, and supervisors
   will limit engine runs during established quiet hours to minimize noise-related disturbances.
   62d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron and 62d Maintenance Squadron production supervisors
   are authorized to approve all idle runs during quiet hours. Approval for power runs will be
   coordinated between the applicable production supervisor and the MOC. The MOC will
   clear all requests for power runs with the Command Post duty officer during quiet hours.
   Final approval authority is the 62 AW/CC but will usually be delegated to the 62 MXG/CC.
   3.2. Maintaining Currency. To maintain currency in ground engine run procedures and
   techniques, those qualified to run engines will do so from the left seat position at least once
   during a 180-day period.
   3.3. C-17 Engine Run Restrictions. See Attachment 2.
4                                                MCCHORDAFBI21-3 21 SEPTEMBER 2009


    3.4. Fire department standby posturing during engine runs.
       3.4.1. Fire department will provide “on-scene” standby assistance for open-cowling
       engines runs under the following conditions:
           3.4.1.1. Any major fuel system component replacement (e.g., fuel control, primary
           fuel feed line, etc.).
           3.4.1.2. Any major fuel system troubleshooting procedure.
           3.4.1.3. Problematic engines (e.g., flameouts, compressor stalls, etc.).
           3.4.1.4. New or completely overhauled engines upon installation.
       3.4.2. Any other standby posturing by fire department personnel will be at the discretion
       of the base Fire Chief or on-duty Senior Fire Official. WARNING: D-26 through D-31
       may be used as MAX power spots only when signs are posted on the Delta to Joker
       Ramp road behind D-27, or at the rear of the aircraft, preventing traffic from entering the
       blast zone of running aircraft. Signs will remain posted until the engine run has been
       terminated.
4. Aircraft Jacking. This section identifies specific aircraft jacking locations for C-17 aircraft
and identifies local hazards and precautions while jacking C-17 aircraft at McChord AFB.
    4.1. C-17 Aircraft Authorized Locations. See Attachment 2.
5. Aircraft Deicing Procedures. This section establishes procedures for implementing Best
Management Practices (BMP) and Pollution Prevention (P2) measures for aircraft deicing
operations. It identifies parking locations where adjacent containment of spent deicing fluid is
possible and describes procedures for collecting effluent from parking aprons. Discharge of
deicing fluid to storm drains during dry or wet weather is a violation of the Clean Water Act and
the McChord AFB National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Multi-Sector
General Storm Water Permit. Provisions of this instruction are applicable to all deicing
operations at McChord AFB.
    5.1. Definition. BMP and P2 measures are procedures designed to eliminate or reduce the
    environmental impact of airfield operations. BMP requires schedules of activities and
    prohibitions of practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants to the waters of the
    United States. BMP also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices
    to control site runoff, spillage, leaks, sludge, waste disposal, or drainage from waste disposal.
    If any part of the BMP is absent, deicing may not be conducted. This instruction is
    concerned specifically with preventing the introduction of deicing fluid into the base storm
    water system.
    5.2. Responsibilities. Commanders and supervisors within the 62d Maintenance and
    Operations Groups are responsible for ensuring compliance with this instruction. The only
    authority to approve deviations from this instruction will be the MXG/CC or designated
    representative.
       5.2.1. The AMXS Line Chief is responsible for coordinating with base weather services
       through the MOC to determine if forecasted weather conditions are likely to result in
       frost or ice formation.
MCCHORDAFBI21-3 21 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            5


     5.2.2. Maintenance Operations (MOS/MXOO) in working with Current Operations
     (OSS/OSO) will coordinate with AMXS Maintenance Supervision through Plans and
     Scheduling (MOS/MXOOS) to review the next day’s local training schedule and delay
     takeoff times until later in the day if practical to minimize deicing requirements.
     5.2.3. The MOC will direct the contractor to parking spots where the contractor will
     install temporary devices on or around adjacent storm drains prior to the commencement
     of deicing.
     5.2.4. The deicing operation supervisor (C-17) or the ranking launch team member will
     ensure the contractor has placed adequate containment devices around or over all storm
     water drains adjacent to the aircraft being deiced to prevent discharge to the storm water
     system.
     5.2.5. The owning AMUs will accomplish actual aircraft deicing. Owning AMUs will
     ensure deicer is not spilled during fluid transfer to the deicing application vehicles and
     will routinely inspect deicing application vehicles to prevent conditions leading to
     inadvertent fluid discharges. Owning AMUs will not apply deicing fluid until adjacent
     storm drains are blocked. They will deice critical aircraft surfaces in accordance with
     aircraft-specific job guides and TO 42C-1-2, Anti-Icing, Deicing, and Defrosting of
     Parked Aircraft. The owning AMUs will minimize the use of deicing fluid by using
     mechanical methods such as sweeping, brushing, using floor squeegees (rubber), or
     dragging a rope across aircraft surfaces to remove heavy accumulations of snow prior to
     use of fluid deicer. WARNING: Do not chip or scrape ice from surfaces. Damage to
     panels and flight control surfaces may occur.
     5.2.6. The deicing operation supervisor (C-17) or the ranking launch team supervisor
     will check the devices for leakage following aircraft block-out. If device leakage is
     noted, immediately contact the owning production superintendent or the MOC to request
     the contractor respond immediately to contain or eliminate the leakage.
     5.2.7. Aircraft deicing should not be conducted with snow on the aircraft parking ramp
     around/under the aircraft due to the difficulties recovering spent deicing fluid absorbed
     into snow. Snow 2 inches or more deep will be removed from the deicing locations and
     the area around the aircraft to be deiced by 62 CES/CEOHH prior to aircraft being
     positioned for deicing to prevent deicing fluid saturated snow accumulation and allow a
     path for the spent deicing fluid vacuum truck to operate. Snow removal priorities are
     established in the McChord AFB Snow Removal and Ice Control Plan 091-99; however,
     specific aircraft parking/deicing area removal requirements will be prioritized to meet C-
     17 daily mission requirements. Snow removal equipment will not be withdrawn from
     priority 1 and 2 areas and directed to priority 3 areas. When snow/ice conditions with
     snow 2 inches or more deep exist or are forecast, the 62 AMXS Line Chief will
     coordinate priorities with the 62 OSS Airfield Manager IAW QRC #1 , Severe Weather
     Procedures. When more than trace amounts of snow are forecast, 62 CES/CEV and
     CEOH will meet with the 62 MXG at the daily scheduling meeting (current time and
     location available from MOC at 982-3336) to integrate snow removal and deicing
     sequence of events with the aircraft launch/movement requirements. When severe
     weather conditions cause snow accumulation beyond 62 CES/CEOH removal capacity
     for aircraft launch requirements and spent deicing fluid recovery difficulties are
6                                                MCCHORDAFBI21-3 21 SEPTEMBER 2009


       anticipated, deicing activities will not be undertaken over snow on the ramp until primary
       and alternate spent deicing fluid dump stations have been approved. The presence of
       snow mixed with spent deicing fluid renders the spent deicing fluid dump station
       inoperative and alternate dump stations must be utilized (CES POC: Mr Gibbens, 982-
       6204). Alternate dump stations are discussed in Section 5.5.3. of this document.
       5.2.8. The wash contractor is responsible for blocking storm drains adjacent to deicing
       operations and capturing and disposing of used deicing fluid. In addition, the wash
       contractor is responsible for proper maintenance and upkeep of vacuum trucks used to
       reclaim used deicing fluids. Daily pre-use inspections of the vacuum truck reclamation
       system will be accomplished to ensure the equipment is in proper working order and free
       of conditions leading to inadvertent fluid discharges. Wash contractor personnel will
       comply with the vacuum truck manufacturer’s periodic preventive maintenance and
       inspection schedule to ensure the vehicle remains in proper working order.
       5.2.9. The AMXS Line Chief and Production supervisors will coordinate and prioritize
       deicing operations when there is a conflict due to multiple launches.
       5.2.10. LRS/LGRF will perform operational inspections of the deicer storage tanks near
       building 730. AFTO Form 39, Fuel System Inspection and Discrepancy Reports, will be
       maintained at Bldg P-28, Fuels Management, in accordance with the Air Force Records
       Disposition Scheduled (RDS) located at Air Force Portal under AFRIMS. The 62
       LRS/LGRF will provide a monthly deicer usage report to CES/CEV identifying the total
       gallons consumed during the winter season (Sep - Apr) as required by the NPDES permit.
       LRS/LGRF will also provide a copy of the deicer Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) to
       CES/CEV annually or when there is a change in a deicer supplier.
       5.2.11. The wash contractor will notify 62 MXG/QAE immediately if either vacuum
       truck is down for maintenance.
       5.2.12. Upon notification from the wash contractor that a vacuum truck is down for
       maintenance, 62 MXG/QAE will notify the vacuum truck manufacturer’s representative
       immediately and arrange for repair services.
    5.3. Aircraft Positioning. The following aircraft parking locations are approved for aircraft
    deicing operations. These locations were identified as safe locations where all deicing fluids
    used may be contained and recovered by a vacuum truck: B-1, B-2, C-5, C-6, C-8, C-9, D-1
    through D-9, D-26 through D-29, DV-2/D-32 through D-43, all Echo Ramp locations, all
    Juliet Ramp locations (except J-1), and Lima Pad. Prior to deicing on D-26 through D-29,
    the aircraft must be moved back 145 feet to eliminate runoff of fluid into storm water drains.
    5.4. Deicing Procedures. Deicing normally occurs 2 hours before scheduled takeoff time.
       5.4.1. Do not deice backup or spare aircraft unless it is tail swapped into a flying line.
       5.4.2. Verification of Need to Deice. Production supervisors must verify the necessity of
       deicing with visual or tactile methods. The tactile method is used to verify the presence
       of clear ice. Personnel will physically touch the aircraft skin and feel for roughness (no
       ice) or smoothness (ice present). Gloves should be off for this inspection. In extremely
       cold weather, use the end of a pencil for verification. Lightly push the eraser along the
MCCHORDAFBI21-3 21 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 7


      aircraft surface. If there is resistance, there is no ice present. If the eraser glides freely
      over the surface, there is ice present.
      5.4.3. Before commencing deicing operations, the deicing operation supervisor (C-17) or
      the ranking launch team member must ensure the contractor has placed adequate
      containment devices around or over all storm water drains adjacent to the aircraft being
      deiced to prevent discharge to the storm water system. Place traffic cones at device
      locations so that covered drains are visible to flight line vehicle operators.
      5.4.4. If a tail swap has been made and the first aircraft has already been deiced, the
      aircraft must be towed to allow the contractor to fully reclaim deicer fluid runoff from
      that parking spot.
      5.4.5. Storm drain devices shall not be removed until all possible deicer runoff and
      standing fluid has been removed from the ramp.
   5.5. Used Deicing Fluid Collection and Disposal.
      5.5.1. The contractor will use the vacuum truck to capture deicing fluid from the parking
      spot and any adjacent areas where fluid has accumulated. The contractor is authorized to
      operate the vacuum trucks in the vicinity of the aircraft being deiced both during and
      after deicing operations (before block-out) to eliminate accumulation of runoff at dams.
      At no time should the vacuum truck operate within 10 feet of the aircraft.
      5.5.2. Immediately following aircraft block-out, the contractor will be directed by the
      MOC to reclaim all runoff from the parking spot.
      5.5.3. Wash contractor will dispose of spent deicing fluid at the Spent Deicing Fluid
      dump station located east of Building 743 and is responsible for dump station cleanup. If
      the outdoor disposal station becomes unusable due to accumulation of snow collected
      with spent deicing fluid, coordination is required with 62 MXG supervision through 62
      MXG/QAE (982-6975/4152) and 62 CES/CEV prior to discarding spent deicing fluid
      and snow in alternate locations. Authorized alternate disposal locations are Hangars 5, 4
      or 6. All of these hangars drain to the sanitary sewer system. Hangar 5 is the primary
      location as the spent deicing fluid does not have to pass through an aircraft wash rack
      treatment unit prior to reaching the sanitary sewer. Hangar 4 is the secondary location,
      and Hangar 6 is only to be utilized in extreme emergency situations.
      5.5.4. The contractor shall remove storm drain devices after the parking spot and
      adjacent areas have been vacuumed and no additional deicer can be removed from the
      pavement.
      5.5.5. When the primary vacuum truck (large) is down for maintenance, use the
      secondary truck (small) for effluent collection.
      5.5.6. When both vacuum trucks are down for maintenance, cease deicing operations
      until they are repaired.
6. Post-Emergency Spill Response Procedures.
   6.1. The following procedures will apply to all hazardous material (HAZMAT) spills
   affecting or involving 62 MXG facilities, the flight line, or MAFB/TA aircraft on the flight
   line:

       6.1.1. The on-scene commander will immediately notify the 62 MOS/MOC at 982-3336,
       and provide all pertinent information (materials, location, quantity, aircraft tail #, etc)
       concerning the spill. The on-scene commander will “safe” the area to the maximum
       extent possible.
       6.1.2. The MOC will immediately notify Aleut Global Solutions ProjectManager or
       Deputy Project Manager utilizing QRC 03 and provide the pertinent information.
       6.1.3. The 62 CES will provide additional spill response assistance IAW the MAFB
       SPLAN 191-98.
       6.1.4. MXG personnel responsible for the spill will assist in the clean-up as directed by
       Aleut Environmental personnel. Responsible MXG personnel will also cooperate in any
       post-response investigation.
       6.1.5. On-duty MXG/QA or other MXG unit supervisory personnel will also notify the
       MOC to ensure paragraph 6.1.2. is accomplished. They will also ensure the affected
       area/aircraft is evacuated and cordoned off until the on-scene commander arrives and
       takes charge.
