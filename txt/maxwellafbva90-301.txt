       You HAVE THE RIGHT to speak with the IG, at any level, without fear of
       reprisal.

           Experiences across the Air Force have shown complaints can best be
           solved by your chain of command.      We ask you to talk to your
           IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR, INSTRUCTOR, FIRST SERGEANT, UNIT
           COMMANDER/NEXT-LEVEL COMMANDER (as appropriate) before coming
           to the IG.

           You WILL get a prompt, fair response through the IG complaint system.
