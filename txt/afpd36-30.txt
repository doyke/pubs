                                                                                            Pages: 8
                                                                                     Distribution: F

1. The Air Force needs high-quality people to operate, maintain, and sustain complex air and space forces
to accomplish its missions. Attracting and retaining these people requires a compensation system that
appropriately recognizes both the unique needs of the military and the extraordinary demands imposed
upon and sacrifices demanded of military members. This directive establishes policies for constructing,
administering, and adjusting

2. A compensation and benefits package for Air Force members should be equitable, fiscally responsible,
and recognize the unique conditions of service. At the same time, it should support force sustainment
objectives in both peacetime and periods of national emergency.
   2.1. An equitable compensation and benefits package also should prevent a decline in members’ liv-
   ing standards, maintain pay comparability with the private sector, and maintain reimbursements at
   levels equal with expenses incurred incident to military service.

3. The compensation system for Air Force members must be predictable, stable, and transparent with
respect to its adjustment systems.

4. The Air Force will help its members and former members understand and be fully apprised of entitle-
ment programs and their eligibility for these programs.
   4.1. Members and former members of the Air Force who meet eligibility requirements for any entitle-
   ment program should have the opportunity to apply for the program, or receive the compensation or
   benefit. This does not preclude establishing and using queues for programs which must be limited in
   the number of participants.

5. The Air Force will ensure that members are aware of the various facets of their compensation package
and that each member has information available to assess the extent and value of that individual’s personal
pay, allowances, and benefits package.

6. By taking prudent measures, the Air Force strives to minimize fraud, waste, and abuse within pro-
grams involving the expenditure of appropriated or nonappropriated funds as part of the military system
of entitlements. Procedures, however, intended to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse should not adversely
impact the provision of statutory or regulatory entitlement programs. The Air Force remains committed
to the principle that its members and former members should receive the full benefit of all compensation
programs to which they are entitled or for which they are eligible.

7. This directive establishes the following responsibilities and authorities:
   7.1. Headquarters US Air Force is responsible for policy oversight and advocacy of the Air Force’s
   military entitlements program and for interface with the Office of the Secretary of Defense staff con-
   cerning development of Department of Defense (DoD) policy and legislative initiatives. The Assis-
   tant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations and Environment (SAF/
   MI) discharges this responsibility for the Secretary of the Air Force.
   7.2. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel (HQ USAF/DP) develops, coordinates, and executes per-
   sonnel policies and essential procedural guidance for managing military entitlement programs.
   7.3. The Chief of Air Force Reserve (HQ USAF/RE) develops military entitlement programs for
   Reserve military members, ensures compliance with HQ USAF policy, and oversees the Reserve
   force.
   7.4. The Director of Air National Guard (NGB/CF) ensures all members and former members of the
   Air National Guard are informed of the eligibility requirements for entitlement programs, and that
   they are given the opportunity to apply for the programs, or receive the compensation or benefits.
   7.5. The Air Force Military Personnel Center (AFMPC) oversees the publishing of field instructions
   to administer active duty entitlement programs and to inform active duty members and former mem-
   bers of eligibility requirements for programs.
   7.6. Major commands establish and execute programs to ensure compliance with all DoD and Air
   Force policies for entitlement programs.

8. Terms Explained:
   8.1. Entitlements. These are monetary or nonmonetary compensation and benefit elements estab-
   lished by statute and to which military members have a legal right, provided they meet established eli-
   gibility criteria. These elements are regarded as part of the total compensation for the members’
   service and include basic pay, Basic Allowance for Quarters, Basic Allowance for Subsistence, Vari-
   able Housing Allowance, bonuses and specialty pays, clothing allowances, travel pays, reimbursable
   expenses, commissary and exchange privileges, medical benefits, leaves, survivor benefits, separation
   pays, oversea station allowances, and retirement pays.

                          MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY

A1.1. Compliance with military entitlement policy will be assessed by measuring the adequacy of the
compensation package. Additionally, compliance with these policies will be assessed by measuring par-
ticipation rates in entitlement programs. Data will be collected by periodic surveys of personnel, or by
use of statistics available through the Advanced Personnel Data System or published by the Federal Gov-
ernment.
   A1.1.1. Adequacy of Compensation Package. The policy that military pay will be predictable and
   will support force sustainment objectives will be measured by examining three areas: comparability
   and purchasing power of basic pay (figure A1.1), the reimbursement for permanent change of station
   (PCS) compared to out-of-pocket expenses, and housing allowances compared to housing expenses
   (figure A1.2). Measurements will be charted annually (on a fiscal year basis).
       A1.1.1.1. Pay comparability will be measured by comparing annual pay raises with annual
       changes in the Employment Cost Index for Civilian Wages and Salaries (ECI W&S).
       A1.1.1.2. Purchasing power will be measured by comparing raises to changes in the Consumer
       Price Index.
       A1.1.1.3. Reimbursement of PCS expenses will be measured by periodic surveys of personnel.
       A1.1.1.4. Housing expense reimbursements will be measured by survey data and independent
       cost data developed by the Per Diem Travel and Transportation Allowance Committee.
   A1.1.2. Participation Rates. The policy that members will be fully apprised of availability of and eli-
   gibility requirements for entitlement programs, and that all members who meet eligibility require-
   ments will be permitted to apply for or receive the benefit, will be measured through program
   participation rates (figure A1.3). Measurements will be charted annually (on a fiscal year basis).
