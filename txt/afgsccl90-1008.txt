requirements to prepare for and conduct unit self-inspections. It complements AFGSCI 13-5304,
Emergency War Order (EWO) Generation and Targeting – Intercontinental Ballistic Missile
(ICBM) (GATI), and implements the guidance found in AFI 90-201, Inspector General
Activities, and the AFGSC supplement to it. Effective unit self-inspections serve as the
foundation to commanders to ensure compliance with governing directives. This document
applies to HQ AFGSC and Twentieth Air Force Staffs, all operational ICBM units, all agencies
that support ICBM targeting, generation, and to active duty personnel and agencies who train and
evaluate these policies. This document does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
and Air National Guard (ANG) units.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This checklist supersedes AFGSCCL90-1008 dated 1 Dec 09 and has been updated with
references to AFGSCI 13-5304 (EWO GATI – ICBM).
1. References are provided for each item. Critical items have been kept to a minimum and are
related to public law, safety, security, fiscal responsibility, and/or mission accomplishment.
2. This publication establishes a baseline guide to be used by units during their self-
inspection process. The Command IG will also use the checklist during applicable assessments.
Items designated as Critical require direct IG evaluation per AFI 90-201. Non-critical items will
be evaluated as time permits. Non-compliance with an item designated as Critical does not
necessarily equate to a critical deficiency during an IG inspection. Attention to non-critical items
helps gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of the unit. AFGSC Checklists will not be
supplemented. Units may produce their own standalone checklists, as needed, to ensure an
effective and thorough review of the unit program. See Attachment 1, Table A1.1
