                                            Chapter 1

                                            GENERAL

1.1. Introduction. This volume documents the Acquisition and Due-In System (ADIS) (J041)
as it applies to buyers and management within the ALC product directorate contracting offices. It
gives guidance on buyer furnished data and the forms used to provide these data. It also
identifies the J041 products that are distributed to and used by the buyer and contracting
management at various levels within the product directorate. Buying cycles and milestones (MS)
definitions, data element codes, and other information needed for system record maintenance and
product use are included in this volume.
1.2. System Concept and Description. The concept is document tracking and status reporting
by progressive file maintenance of previously established system records, as the purchase
request/military interdepartmental purchase request (PR/MIPR) goes through the contracting
process to contract award. As specific events occur, contracting and requirements provide J041
input to update the appropriate records. Periodically, J041 provides buyers and product
directorate management products which depict the current and forecasted status of all PR/MIPRs
cross-referenced to their related solicitation or contractual documents. The system also provides
periodic summary products identifying quantitative and financial volume of activity as well as
frequency and types of delinquencies. These products are useful in identifying and correcting
problem areas and for overall contract workload management.
1.3. Criticality of Buyer File Maintenance. Timely, complete, and accurate input of buyer
furnished data is critical to efficient J041 operation and to buyer support, as well as other mission
functions. Input of milestone and contract abstract actions keeps the item manager (IM) and
buyer apprised of the current PR/MIPR status, and provides a concise picture of the current
workload position. It also enables timely establishment of purchase history records for future
buys, and detailed contract records for production surveillance/due-in reporting.
1.4. Responsibilities. HQ AFMC and ALC responsibilities for development, maintenance and
support necessary for efficient operation of J041 are in chapter 2. Buyers, contracting
management, and data entry personnel will:
     1.4.1. Determine and assign proper contracting cycle codes to all PR/MIPRs and other
     documents received for contract action (paragraph 2.2).
     1.4.2. Depending on local procedures (paragraph 3.1), provide either coded milestone
     information or the data needed to code the milestone transaction on time.
     1.4.3. After input of the MS 02 transaction, the buyer or supporting activities should
     normally do a detailed review of the PR/MIPR package prior to solicitation preparation.
     1.4.4. Complete and forward to data input personnel AFMC Form 453A, Buyer Data
     Abstract, AFMC Form 453B, Contract Line Item Data, and AFMC Form 453C, Buyer
     Data Abstract - Contract Modifications.
     1.4.5. Determine and provide exception reason codes when appropriate (chapter 7).
     1.4.6. Upon request, help correct exception conditions caused by erroneous buying division
     input.

  1.4.7. Process (review, analyze, start corrective actions, and so forth) J041 system products
  as soon as possible after receipt. Report repeated late receipt of system products to the J041
  system monitor for initiation of corrective action.
  1.4.8. Advise J041 system monitor of any known or suspected deficiency for analysis and
  corrective action.
  1.4.9. Periodically review J041 system operation impacts on the buyer and product
  directorate, and recommend improvements to the J041 system monitor.
  1.4.10. Review PRs for deficiencies/discrepancies and contact the IM for problem resolution
  and initiation of corrective action.
  1.4.11. Coordinate subsequent changes to the PR, such as revisions to the delivery schedule,
  and so forth.
  1.4.12. Data entry personnel will input MS 01 transactions in J041 (Optional) on active PRs.
  Required on BX amendments.

                                             Chapter 2

         CONTRACTING PROCEDURES ASSOCIATED WITH ALC CENTRAL
                       CONTRACTING CONTRACTS

2.1. General.
     2.1.1. The following paragraphs give the basic procedures and actions performed by
     contracting personnel so the system accurately reflects the internal and incoming PR/MIPRs
     document status.
     2.1.2. All references to transactions throughout this phase of the system pertain to
     information portrayed in the data entry process, which is designated so data can be
     represented in the proper input format.
2.1.3. AFMC/PK has established twenty cycles to track and control the processing of central
contracting actions within the ALC contracting activity
2.2. Cycle Definitions.
     2.2.1. Buy Cycles. The following cycles track the processing of contract actions which
     satisfy PR/MIPR requirements. Note: When a PR requesting a basic indefinite delivery
     contract and a separate PR for the first order against the contract are received together,
     process both actions in the same cycle. Select the cycle using the estimated dollar value and
     PEC of the basic document. When a PR, requesting a basic indefinite delivery contract,
     contains the requirement for the first order, process the basic document using Cycle A. Select
     the cycle for the first order using the estimated dollar value and PEC of the basic document.
     When a PR requesting a basic indefinite delivery contract does not contain a requirement for
     a first order, select the cycle using the estimated dollar value and PEC. These cycles form the
     basis for the "BUY ACTIONS" management indicator:
        2.2.1.1. Cycle 1 - Sealed Bid Contracting. Use for all purchases by sealed bidding except
        two-step purchases and partial set-asides. Enter contracts which are 100 percent set-aside
        for small business, labor surplus area, or balance-of-payments and restricted sealed
        bidding in this cycle. Enter and complete partial set-asides (both set-aside and non-set-
        aside portion) in cycles 4, 6, 7, 8, D, or E. Time standard is 85 days.
        2.2.1.2. Cycle 2 - Two Step Contracting. Use for all purchases, whether advertised or
        negotiated, and regardless of estimated or actual dollar value, wherein technical proposals
        and prices are separately solicited in consecutive steps. Time standard is 190 days.
        2.2.1.3. Cycle 3 - Agency Source Selection. Use for all purchases $100M and over using
        source selection procedures according to AFFARS 5315.3. Time standard is 220 days.
        2.2.1.4. Cycle 4 - Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), competitive. Use for all
        actions involving solicitation and award using procedures authorized in FAR, Part 12
        (Acquisition of Commercial Items Not More Than $6.5M) and Part 13 (Purchases Not
        More than $150,000), including anticipated value of options. In this cycle, do not enter
        PR/MIPR-generated modifications to existing contracts or actions issued under pre-
        established price or delivery agreements (other than a simultaneous first order). Time
        standard is 70 days.
AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                               7


     2.2.1.5. Cycle 5 - Median Source Selection. Use for all medium purchases
     ($10M<$100M) using source selection procedures according to AFFARS 5315.3. Time
     standard is 165 days.
     2.2.1.6. Cycle 6 - Negotiated Contract, competitive. Use for negotiated purchases
     involving the solicitation of offers where the estimated dollar value of the requirement is
     from $150,000 to less than $550,000, including anticipated value of options. In this cycle,
     do not enter PR/MIPR-generated modifications to existing contracts or actions issued
     under pre-established price or delivery agreements (other than a simultaneous first order).
     Time standard is 85 days.
     2.2.1.7. Cycle 7 - Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), noncompetitive. Use for
     purchases requiring solicitation of price and delivery and award of an order or call
     according to FAR Part 13 (Purchases not more than $150,000) or FAR Part 12
     (Acquisition of Commercial Items not more than $6.5M). Time standard is 75 days.
     2.2.1.8. Cycle 8 - Negotiated Contract, competitive. Use for negotiated purchases
     involving the solicitation of offers where the estimated dollar value of the requirement is
     $550,000 or more, including anticipated value of options. In this cycle, do not enter
     PR/MIPR-generated modifications to existing contracts or actions issued under pre-
     established price or delivery agreements (other than a simultaneous first order). Time
     standard is 90 days.
     2.2.1.9. Cycle 9 - Basic Source Selection. Use for all purchases (<$10M) using source

     involving the solicitation of offers where the estimated dollar value of the requirement is
     from $150,000 to less than $550,000, including anticipated value of options. Do not enter
     PR/MIPR-generated modifications to existing contracts and actions issued under pre-
     established price and delivery agreements (other than a simultaneous first order) in this
     cycle. Time standard is 85 days.
     2.2.1.11. Cycle E - Negotiated Contract, noncompetitive. Use for negotiated purchases
     involving the solicitation of offers where the estimated dollar value of the requirement is
     $550,000 or more including anticipated value of options. Do not enter PR/MIPR-
     generated modifications to existing contracts and actions issued under pre-established
     price and delivery agreements (other than a simultaneous first order) in this cycle. Time
     standard is 90 days.
     2.2.1.12. Cycle F - Undefinitized Actions. Use for issuing all contractual actions that
     require definitization including letter contracts and unpriced BOA orders, including those
     issued for permanent safety modifications, Undefinitized Modification (Change Order)
     Issuance. Cycle will start at MS 02 for PR-generated modifications or non-PR MS 07 for
     non-PR modifications. Time standard is 45 days.
     2.2.1.13. Cycle L –Reserved
     2.2.1.14. Cycle M - Delivery Order, Prepriced Order or Call Issuance. Use for issuing all
     PR-generated unilateral actions issued under pre-established price and delivery

8                                                   AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER 2011


       simultaneously with the basic document, select the cycle for the first order using the
       estimated dollar value PEC of the basic document (see note, paragraph 2.2.2.1). If the
       first order is generated after award of the basic, process it and all subsequent orders in
       this cycle. Typical contractual actions to be processed in this cycle include delivery
       orders, orders against pre-established or prepriced BOA (includes only those BOAs with
       annualized synopsis and J&A) provisions (including re-determinable orders against IDIQ
       arrangements), catalog contract orders, and orders against prepriced call contracting
       arrangements. Time standard is 15 days.
       2.2.1.15. Cycle N - PR-Generated Contract Modifications. All contract modifications
       (except change orders requiring definitization, modifications which definitize change
       orders, modifications for provisioned item orders, and actions that normally would be
       processed as a stand alone acquisition were it not for the ability to add the new
       requirement to a current contract) issued to satisfy PR/MIPR line item requirements will
       be processed in this cycle regardless of dollar value. Time standard is 20 days.
    2.2.2. non-PR/MIPR Cycles. The following cycles are established primarily for managerial
    and administrative purposes to account for the volume and allocation of delivery agreements.
       2.2.2.1. Cycle A - Basic Contract Agreements. Use for the input of ALC-prepared no-
       PR/non-obligating contractual arrangements including Basic Agreements, BOAs, BPAs,
       and any non-obligating modifications to such basic agreements. Time standard is 5 days.
       2.2.2.2. Cycle P - Modifications for Provisioned Item Orders. Time standard is 5 days.
       2.2.2.3. Cycle Q - non-PR/MIPR Modifications (Buyer/Procuring Contracting Officer
       (PCO) prepared). Use for inputting buyer/PCO-prepared unilateral and bilateral contract
       modifications, order amendments, and exhibit revisions resulting from non-PR/MIPR
       actions. Typical input for this cycle includes, claim settlements, additions or alterations of
       contractual clauses, addition of a new quantity step or quantity range to indefinite
       delivery contracts and administrative changes. Use this cycle for non-NSN components
       of parts kits when out for award to multiple contractors. Time standard is 5 days.
       2.2.2.4. Cycle T - non-PR/MIPR Modification. Use for inputting all unilateral and
       bilateral actions, except modifications for provisioned item orders. Typical input for this
       cycle includes initial shipping instructions (ISI) and amended shipping instructions (ASI)
       issuance, contract delivery schedule revisions, and ALC termination contracting officer
       (TCO)-prepared termination actions. Time standard is 5 days.
       2.2.2.5. Cycle Z - Miscellaneous J041 input. Use for input of contractual documents
       prepared by or issued by activities other than the local ALC contracting activity. Typical
       input for this cycle includes Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO)-issued
       modifications, plant resident provisioning team-issued actions, and Contract
       Administration Office (CAO)-prepared termination settlement agreements. Time standard
       is 5 days.
    2.2.3. Definitization Cycles. The following cycle is set up to track the processing of
    definitization actions.
       2.2.3.1. Cycle W - Undefinitized Contract Actions (UCA) Definitization. Use this cycle
       to track the processing of definitization action following issuance of an undefinitized
AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                                9


       contract. The cycle starts on the day following distribution of the undefinitized
       contracting action and remains in effect until final distribution of the superseding
       definitive document. Time standard is 180 days. MS 11 is the only milestone action that
       can process against this cycle. NOTE: This cycle cannot be manually assigned by the
       Buyer.
2.3. Cycle Matrix.
   2.3.1. The Cycle Matrix, Table 2.1, is a graphic illustration of the many contracting plans
   available to ALC central buying personnel. The milestones identified across the top of the
   matrix identify mandatory milestones presently required in the J041 system. MS 00, 02, 07,
   and 11 are required by AFMC and they are also the minimum required for local ALC use.
   MS 00 will always be 0 days. MS 07 for no-PR/MIPR generated actions will also be 0 days.
2.4. Cycle Selection.
   2.4.1. Cycle selection is the key to management control and status of individual contractual
   document processing. So, input the MS 02 transaction as early as practicable after
   contracting receives a PR/MIPR.
   2.4.2. The buyer selects the contracting cycles when completing the MS 02 information or in
   the case of non-PR actions, the MS 07 information. Select all buy cycles except F and M on
   the basis of the acquisition method, extent of competition, and the PR/MIPR estimate. Select
   the remaining cycles on the basis of the type of contractual document to be issued.
   2.4.3. The contracting activity buying offices may consolidate several PR/MIPRs on one
   solicitation and, subsequently, one award. The total estimated amount of the purchase
   requests governs the cycle code to be used. For example, assuming that five PRs will be
   consolidated on one request for proposal (RFP), the buyer selects the cycle code applicable to
   the total amount.
2.5. Cycle Change. At the outset, it's important to choose the correct cycle code for each
contractual action. There are some situations where it is permissible to change the contracting
cycle following initial selection. A change to the contracting cycle applies under the following
conditions:
   2.5.1. When PR/MIPR amendments, consolidations, or other unforeseeable conditions arise
   which would cause the contracting cycle selected on the basis of the PR estimate to be
   incompatible with the actual award cycle, the action may be completed in the longer cycle.
   Do not change actions in process to shorten cycles regardless of the actual award document
   issued.
   2.5.2. Receipt of PR/MIPR amendments that increase the purchase value so the PR/MIPR
   will qualify for the next longer (time) cycle within the negotiated contract cycles.
   2.5.3. Receipt of proposals that change the method of price evaluation so the action now
   qualifies for a longer cycle. (Example: If a buyer assigned the original cycle based on price
   competition and only one proposal is received which requires pricing by other than price
   competition, change the cycle to the appropriate other than price competition cycle.)
   2.5.4. Other conditions that would cause the contracting cycle selected, below the SAT, to be
   incompatible are:
 10                                                     AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER

          Surplus Buy
          Reprocurement Data
          8(A) Set-Aside
          Special Tooling and Test Equipment
   2.5.5. When a purchase is in process, and unforeseen conditions require an Unpriced BOA
   Order or Letter Contract be used to complete the acquisition, do not change the cycle code to
   reflect the method used. However, the MS 1B transaction must contain the proper type
   instrument code to start the definitization cycle. For Letter Contract the Type Instrument will
   be “L”, for Unpriced BOA Order the Type Instrument will be “N”, and for Undefinitized
   Modification (Change Order) Issuance Type Instrument will be “S”.
   2.5.6. J041 will accept cycle changes after processing the MS 11 transaction. You must
   process the change prior to the end of the monthly preaward process and ensure it is
   compatible with the type instrument.
   2.5.7. Contracting has not established a separate cycle to record the status of ALC
   Commander Approved Emergency Contracts. Process such actions according to AFMCI 23-
   102 and local ALC directives. When the emergency requirement is received, enter the action
   into the proper cycle based on the document to be issued.
   2.5.8. Process all bilateral contract modifications issued to satisfy PR/MIPR line item
   requirements in Cycle N. Do not enter such actions in the longer buy cycles. When the nature
   and complexity of the requirement will not permit timely completion of the action within the
   cycle standard, give consideration to the propriety of the contemplated action (whether
   issuance of a change order or new contracting action would be more appropriate to the
   requirement than a bilateral modification). Management at two levels above the
   buyer/contracting officer may individually authorize the use of the Special Exception Code
   55 (Standard exceeded in accordance with Contracting Plan) along with appropriate contract
   modifications meeting the stated exception criteria.
2.6. Milestones. Contracting has established a maximum of 12 milestones to record progress
and current status of a contracting action. The number of milestones used to record contracting
action progress will vary according to the complexity and nature of the action contemplated.
J041 will automatically generate the milestone transaction required for any contracting action.
AFMC/PK requires certain milestones to be input to J041, the remainder being optional to the
ALC.
   2.6.1. The milestones for the Contract Award and Modification Cycles (table 2.1) are:
       2.6.1.1. MS 00 - PR/MIPR receipt in the contracting activity (Required). This milestone
       establishes a record of the PR/MIPR in contracting. There is a 3 day processing cycle
       standard from release of the document by the requirements activity to pickup by the
       contracting activity. AFMC/PK requires MS 00. Enter branch code in the MS 00
       transaction when a buy is in process for that stock number and has not processed beyond
       MS 02.
       2.6.1.2. MS 01 - Buyer Assignment (Optional). Required on “BX” Amendments only.
       This milestone is complete and the milestone transaction is input when the PR/MIPR has
AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                              11


     been assigned to a buyer. This milestone establishes the buyer identification in J041 for
     the particular document involved. Enter Branch/Section/Buyer(optional)/ code in the MS
     01 transaction when a buy is in process for that stock number and has not processed
     beyond MS 02.
     2.6.1.3. MS 02 - Cycle Selection (Required). This milestone is complete and the
     milestone transaction is input when the buyer has determined the cycle in which the
     PR/MIPR will be processed and has obtained the solicitation number, if applicable.
     AFMC requires MS 02. BSB code must be entered in the MS 02 transaction when a buy
     is in process for that stock number and has not processed beyond MS 02.
     2.6.1.4. MS 03, 04, 05, 06 are for optional use at the discretion of each ALC. The using
     ALC will develop milestone definitions.
     2.6.1.5. MS 07, Request for Contract (Required). For PR actions, the ALC may use
     some discretion as to precisely when the MS 07 is input. This milestone is complete and
     the milestone transaction is input when the PCO/buyer requests automated preparation of
     the contract document. With one exception, when a request is received from the Buyer to
     put Exception Reason (ERC) 65 against a PR, then Milestone 07 will be input at that
     time. non-PR Milestone 07 transactions are input when the Buyer distributes a copy of
     the awarded document to the J041 technician. The Contracting J041 Technician
     processes both the PR and non-PR MS 07. AFMC/PK requires MS 07.
     2.6.1.6. MS 08, 09, and 10 are for optional use at the discretion of each ALC. The using
     ALC will develop milestone definitions and time standards.
     2.6.1.7. MS 11, Final Distribution (Required). This milestone is complete when the
     contract has been distributed. When the contractor has been notified orally of the
     Government's intent to accept the offer, make the final distribution to complete this
     milestone; enter the date of the original notification to compute the buy cycle completion.
     Complete and input the MS 11 information in the J041 system. AFMC/PK requires MS
     11.
  2.6.2. Milestones for Definitization Cycles (Table 2.1). See chapter 4 for processing
  instructions.
  2.6.3. Milestones for Cycles 3, 5 and 9 (Source Selection):
     2.6.3.1. MS 03, Solicitation Distribution, is complete when the Source Selection
     Advisory Council (SSAC) establishes the evaluation criteria, assigns a weighing factor to
     each item, establishes the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB), prepares the RFP,
     and releases the RFP.
     2.6.3.2. MS 04, Proposal Received, is complete when the preproposal conference is
     conducted and proposals are received.
     2.6.3.3. MS 05, Technical or Cost Evaluation, is complete when RFP evaluation and
     clarification actions are completed, contracts have been negotiated, and SSEB overall
     briefing given to the SSAC.
     2.6.3.4. MS 07, Contract Preparation, is complete when the SSAC has selected the
     successful contractor.

               PURCHASE REQUEST PROCESSING AND DEFINITIONS

3.1. General. The following procedures govern the initial actions required to maintain
information within J041 for contractual actions generated by a PR/MIPR. Local management
may modify, at their option, the procedures in this chapter on the exchange of milestone
information and related data between buying personnel and the data systems office. The buyer or
his/her management provides the data needed to ensure a timely and accurate update of J041
system records.
3.2. Purchase Requests (Milestones):
   3.2.1. During the PR/MIPR preparation phase, J041 mechanically suspends MS 00, and 02
   transactions to await receipt of an approved PR/MIPR. The system produces the purchase
   history record (PHR) and sends it to the PR/MIPR control desk.
   3.2.2. The PR/MIPR control desk or the contracting office responsible for processing the MS
   00 in J041, upon receipt of the PR/MIPR within contracting, including reworks being
   returned to contracting following rework, will input the MS 00 transaction with the proper
   branch/section/buyer code, for processing in the J041 system.
   3.2.3. The Requirements PR/MIPR control desk forwards the PR/MIPR package and PHR to
   the appropriate buying section. When the proper buying section receives the PR/MIPRs,
   Contracting management should identify the proper buyer code for the milestone processing
   and forward it to the office responsible for input to J041. Contracting management then sends
   the PR/MIPR package to the buyer.
   3.2.4. When all line items on the PR/MIPR are to be placed on a single solicitation document
   and there is no PR/MIPR consolidation, buying section will provide MS 02 data: BSB, cycle,
   solicitation number to the Contracting J041 Technician. If a consolidation or split solicitation
   is used, the buyer prepares MS 02 data and sends it to the office responsible for J041 coding
   for each PR/MIPR line item applicable to the solicitation line item. When a PR line item
   quantity is split into two or more solicitation line items on the same solicitation, code a MS
   02 transaction for each solicitation line item which contains a part of the PR line item
   quantity. Upon completing MS 02, the buyer will provide the MS 02 information noting the
   following information: Asterisk procedures may only be used when a PR has 2 or more line
   items. J041 will perpetuate the PR/MIPR line item number, from each line item on the
   PR/MIPR, to the solicitation line item number. One and only one MS 02 action can be
   submitted against multiline PR/MIPR assignment.
   3.2.5. The MS 02 transaction can be used to change the branch, section, buyer codes.
   3.2.6. Take the utmost care when a PR/MIPR line item is split at MS 02. Careful adherence
   to the above instructions will help prevent errors. The following example illustrates the
   correct procedure for a split: PR no.FD2060-11-56412, line item 0001, line item quantity of
   500 is split into two solicitations, each with a quantity of 250:

J041 requires two MS 02 transactions for PR line item FD2060-11-56412 (0001).
   3.2.7. Input a MS 07 transaction for each solicitation line item applicable to a contract.
   3.2.8. At MS 07, the buyer/contracting officer may determine the two solicitations will be
   split into four awards.

Prepare four MS 07 transactions, each with a quantity of 125 and each identified to PR line item
FD2060-11-56412(0001). Any unused quantity retains status until a MS 02 or an MS 07
transaction updates it. Send the MS 07 transaction to data entry personnel for input.
   3.2.9. A PR/MIPR line quantity can be split into a maximum of five parts. Do this by
   splitting the total PR/MIPR quantity to five solicitation line items as in the following
   examples:
       3.2.9.1. Example 1 (Different Solicitations):
PR LI 0001 qty 25
         Solic B1233 LI 0001,      qty     1
         Solic B1234 LI 0001,      qty     4
         Solic B1235 LI 0001,      qty     2
         Solic B1236 LI 0001,      qty     3
         Solic B1237 LI 0001,      qty    15
                                          25

       3.2.9.2. Example 2 (Same Solicitation):

   3.2.10. Associating the Solicitation to the PIIN. When the buyer prepares the contract
   document, the buyer must remember that in the J041 system solicitation, solicitation line
AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                              15


   item and solicitation quantity must be associated to the PIIN, CLIN, and CLIN quantity. A
   solicitation line item quantity cannot be split to more than five CLINs.
       3.2.10.1. Example 1 (Same CLIN)
Solic LI 0001, qty 15
          PIIN No. 1, CLIN No. 0001,      qty     6
          PIIN No. 2, CLIN No. 0001,      qty     2
          PIIN No. 3, CLIN No. 0001,      qty     2
          PIIN No. 4, CLIN No. 0001,      qty     4
          PIIN No. 5, CLIN No. 0001,      qty     1
                                                 15

       3.2.10.2. Example 2 (Different CLINs)
Solic LI 0001, qty 15
          PIIN No. 6, CLIN No. 0001,      qty     1

          PIIN No. 6, CLIN No. 0004,      qty     2
          PIIN No. 6, CLIN No. 0005,      qty     4
                                                 15

3.3. Consolidating Two or More Solicitations into One Contractual Document. The
following rules apply:
   3.3.1. Contracting can consolidate two or more solicitation line items into one contract line
   item only if they are both (all) for the same stock number, program year funds citation, and
   (if applicable) war readiness material (WRM)/peace time operating spares (POS) indicator.
   3.3.2. Take extreme care to ensure the correct solicitation line item number (MS 07
   transaction) is identified as it relates to the corresponding CLIN (by stock number as shown
   on the solicitation document(s) versus the contract document).
   3.3.3. Show the same buyer and cycle codes for all solicitation line items which are to be
   consolidated on one contractual document. Do this before submitting the MS 07 transactions,
   unless the solicitation line items are to be split into two or more contractual documents. In
   this situation, make the buyer and cycle changes after the MS 07 transactions are submitted.
   NOTE: Buyer doesn’t actually submit MS 07. MS 07 is input into J041 at the time a copy is
   distributed to the contracting J041 technician. With one exception, when a request is
   received from the Buyer to put Exception Reason (ERC) 65 against a PR, Milestone 07 will
   be input at that time.
3.4. Maximum Possible Split of PR/MIPR LI to CLIN. One PR line item can be split to a
maximum of five solicitation line items and one solicitation line item can be split to a maximum
of five contract line items. This provides a maximum of 25 contract line items for any PR/MIPR
line item.
 16                                                       AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER
2011


3.5. MS 07 Transactions for Orders against IQ Contracts. When inputting sources solicited
and offers received in the MS 07 transactions on orders against IQ contracts, enter the actual
number of sources and offers received when awarding the basic contract.
3.6. MS 07 Transactions for Contracts with First Articles. Generate two MS 07 transactions
for all contracts which have a first article. Normally, the line item for the first article is 0001AA
with a quantity of one, with line item 0001AB reflecting the remaining quantity and total dollar
amount. The following example will clarify the MS 07 transaction coding:

                                 Contract Line Item
Contract Number                  Number             Qty
FA8500-11-C-6102000000           0001AA                1
   (First Article)
FA8500-11-C-6102000000           0001AB               99
The total quantity shown on the purchase request for the above example would be 100. The
example above in no way changes your contract preparation. This example is for J041 system
purposes only. The coding clerk would code these MS 07 transactions as a split. Code the PR
number, PR line item number, and quantity on the MS 07 transactions.
3.7. MS 08, 09, 10, 11 (Optional).
   3.7.1. Data services will send to the J041 coding section the MS 08, 09, 10, and 11
   transactions generated by MS 07 input.
   3.7.2. Submit the MS 08, 09, and 10 transactions for processing at the proper time, as
   defined by the local ALC.
3.8. PR/MIPR Amendments. Amendments have no cycle and are considered automatically
released to contracting when entered. The following occurs:
   3.8.1. If an amendment has no line item impact, the MS 00 and MS 02 transactions will
   automatically be tied into the Basic PR by the Contracting J041 technician.
3.8.2. Reserved
   3.8.3. If the basic PR/MIPR is beyond MS 02, the Contracting J041 Technician will process
   a MS 02 transaction for each line item affected by the amendment. The following will occur:
       3.8.3.1. If the buyer intends to meet the requirements of the amendment by processing it
       with the basic PR/MIPR, the buyer should enter the same solicitation number as the basic
       PR/MIPR line item. The amendment will then be merged with the basic for all
       subsequent processing by the Contracting J041 Technician.
       3.8.3.2. In the event the buyer must accomplish the requirements of the amendment by a
       separate contractual action, the buyer must process the MS 02 transaction showing the
       proper quantity and the new solicitation number and solicitation line item number. All
       subsequent processing will be a separate action.
   3.8.4. Process total cancellation amendments as follows:
AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                               17


       3.8.4.1. If the basic PR/MIPR is not yet beyond MS 02 processing, the amendment MS
       00 will cancel the basic document along with all associated line items and prior
       amendments.
       3.8.4.2. If the basic PR/MIPR is beyond MS 02, process the amendment MS 00. The
       buyer will either initiate the processing of the MS 02 transaction to cancel the PR/MIPR
       requirement or will process a MS 00 correction transaction for the amendment citing the
       appropriate return for rework exception code to reject the amendment.
   3.8.5. BX amendment. If the basic and preceding amendment(s) have previously been
   awarded and cleared the system and a new amendment to the basic PR/MIPR comes into
   contracting, process a MS 00 to accept the amendment or process a C00 transaction to reject
   the BX amendment.
3.9. Document Aging. The following items set forth the way by which a Date in P is
established:
   3.9.1. J041 automatically assigns the processing date as the Date in P in the MS 00
   transaction.
   3.9.2. When a pre-invitation notice award is used and the proper code is entered in the MS
   02 transaction, J041 extends the remaining time to complete the cycle an extra 15 days over
   the normal standard for the selected cycle.
   3.9.3. For non-PR actions entering the system at MS 07, the Contracting J041 Technicians
   will enter the actual Date in P in the MS 07 transaction; if a date is not entered, J041 will
   automatically assign the MS 07 transaction processing date as the Date in P.
   3.9.4. For definitization cycles, the Date in P will be the date of award which is entered in
   the MS 11 transaction for the unpriced action.
   3.9.5. It will not be possible to change the Date in P for PR/MIPRs while a document is in
   contracting. When two or more PR/MIPRs or increments are combined on a single
   contractual document, age will be based on the oldest PR/MIPR or increment thereof.
   3.9.6. For PR/MIPRs which have been returned for rework with one of the following
   Rework Codes: 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 86, 88, 89 and subsequently
   resubmitted to contracting, the original Date in P will be kept in the J041 Master File record
   for this PR, but future document aging will be based on the adjusted Date-In-P. When the PR
   is removed from rework after using one of these codes, the system will take the days in
   rework and add the days to the Original Date-In-P and calculates an adjusted Date-In-P.
For example: If a PR/MIPR has a doc age of 20 days when it was put in rework, it will have a
doc age of 20 days when it comes out of rework.
When return is based on exception reason codes 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, or 8J, base aging upon the
date received in contracting from rework to allow for resolicitation with no other consideration
for time in rework. Exception Reason Return Codes 82, 83, 84, 85, 87 or 8J will give a new
Date-In-P. This date will is based on the date the PR/MIPR is received back in contracting from
rework (MS 00 Date).
The PR/MIPR will continue to age on the reports while in rework; however, when it is removed
from rework the PR/MIPR will be 1 day old.
 18                                                     AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER
2011


For example, if the PR/MIPR has a document age of 100 days when it is put in rework with one
of these codes, when it is removed from rework, the doc age will based on the date received back
in contracting from rework which will be the date that MS 00 was processed in J041. Because it
assumes the processing date of the MS 00 date, the PR will be one day old.
   3.9.7. ERC 65 will suspend document aging. See chapter 7 for explanation.
AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                                 19


                                           Chapter 4

                                      NON-PR ACTIONS

4.1. Cycle and Transaction for non-PR Actions. Cycles A, P, Q, T, and Z will always start in
MS 07.
   4.1.1. To start any non-PR action at non-PR MS 07, the buyer will provide a copy of the
   Contract & AFMC FORM 453C to the Contracting J041 Technician for coding of the
   following data which is input by the Contracting J041 Technician into J041:
Block                          Remarks
(1) Status                     Enter C.
(2) PIIN                       Enter PIIN number.
(3) PIIN Supp                  Enter PIIN Supp. (Enter zeros if order or modification number is
                               not applicable.)
(4) Milestone                  Enter 07.
(5) Branch, Section, Buyer     Enter Proper Code
(6) Date in P                  Enter proper date. If left blank, processing date will be assumed
                               as Date in P.
(7) Cycle Code                 Enter proper cycle code.
(8) Number of Line Items       For provisioning modification only, If cycle other than P, zeros
                               are mechanically assigned.

   4.1.2. After processing the non-PR MS 07, the action will proceed in the same manner as the
   PR generated cycles.
4.2. Issuance and Definitization. This paragraph applies to any action that causes issuance and
definitization of contractual actions. This will cover actions with the following type instrument
codes:
        L- Letter Contract Issuance
        N- Unpriced BOA Order Issuance
        S- Undefinitized Modification (Change Order) Issuance

   4.2.1. When one of the preceding type instrument codes is included in the MS 1B contract
   data transaction (transaction code 1B), J041 will establish a definitization suspense record for
   the document with cycle code W. The Date in P will be the date of award cited in the MS 11
   for the issuance, and the action will appear on status products (4DA, 4JE, ) awaiting MS 11.
   Also, a message "Definitization Suspense Record" will appear for the action on the Daily
   PR/MIPR Status (4DA, Part 2).
   4.2.2. When a definitization action is established in cycle code W, a MS 11 transaction is
   input by the Contracting J041 Technician, to J041 to remove the definitization suspense
   record, when a definitization mod against a contract or given change order has been
   accomplished. ERC, BSB change or deletion are the only other input for this action since its
   only purpose is to suspense the completion of definitization.

2011


   4.2.3. The contracting J041 Technician will Process Letter Contract, Unpriced BOA Change
   Order issuances the same way as any other basic contract except that no dollar balancing is
   required. Input of CLIN prices is not required in J041. J041 assigns zeros and no money is
   passed to postaward on the PAE records. After monthly reporting of the issuance, the line
   items will be dropped out of preaward and the definitizing mod will be processed just like
   any other non-PR mod covered earlier in this chapter. The data processing section must code
   the CLIN unit price and any other data changed or added by the mod must be coded directly
   into postaward. Buying division personnel use the monthly Line Item Definitization report,
   Section II, PCN: A-J041.-5WA-M5-M50 or J018R version J018R-5WA-Monthly of this
   report to ensure that individual line items are definitized (paragraph 5.1).
   4.2.4. When a definitization suspense record is not established due to improper type
   instrument code, Contracting J041 Technician will input a non-PR MS 07 to create the
   definitization suspense record.
AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                                  21


                                            Chapter 5

                                MISCELLANEOUS ACTIONS

5.1. Line Item Definitization Processing. The J041 system has been designed to identify line
items requiring price and schedule definitization. A time limit of 180 days with a prior notice of
30 days is provided to alert the PCO that definitization is due. If a definitization time standard
cited on the contract exceeds the 180-day limit, buying personnel can adjust the suspense record
and standard. Contact the Contracting J041 Technician data entry personnel for assistance. This
information is displayed on the Line Item Definitization Report (5WA). Section I of the report
covers provisioned items and Section II covers change orders, letter contracts, and unpriced
orders.
5.2. Definitizing Delivery Schedules for Contract Line Items Involved with First Article
Requirements. Those contract line item schedules that stipulate delivery will be made in a
stated number of days subsequent to the government's acceptance of the first article, do not
require a contract modification for definitization. Upon receipt of an official notice of acceptance
of the first article from the PCO, buying and administrative personnel: will compute the actual
delivery dates for each applicable schedule; provide a copy of the first article approval letter to
the Contracting J041 Technician for updating the schedule date; and process a PDG transaction
for each applicable schedule. This action establishes firm schedule dates in J041.
5.3. Purchase Requests for Parts Kits. Process the kit stock number as a PR action when parts
kits are broken out for award of components to several contractors. Process the remaining
nonstock numbered components separately as non-PR actions in cycle Q and type Instrument
code Z (negotiated) or C (priced BOA order). If the product division determines an NC or ND
stock number (SN) is required, the IM will be asked to assign the NC/ND number by PR
amendment to the line item. This will process through the normal J041 contracting cycle. Note,
only those components purchased from the contractor who assembles the kit will be input to
purchase history against the kit SN. Purchase history will, therefore, not show the total cost of
the SN parts kit.
5.4. Contract Delivery Schedules:
   5.4.1. State the delivery of requirements in the clearest manner possible to make sure there is
   no misunderstanding in coding contract delivery schedules.
   5.4.2. Use specific calendar dates when practical. After receipt of Orders (ARO) convert
   delivery terms to calendar dates and input into the system (postaward only).
5.5. Manufacturer Codes. The following tells how manufacturer codes are assigned. Do not
distribute contracts without a permanent code.
   5.5.1. The buyer will:
       5.5.1.1. At the time of contract number assignment, screen the Defense Logistics
       Information System (DLIS) and the locally published list of newly assigned codes to
       determine if a code has been assigned to a contractor.
       5.5.1.2. Contractor is responsible for registering in CCR if he doesn’t have a code.
5.6. Buyer Procedures for Generic Stock Numbers. (Acquisition Advice Code W)
 22                                                       AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER
2011


   5.6.1. Assign acquisition advice code W to identify a generic stock number for use in
   solicitations, allowance lists, and so forth, against which no stocks are ever recorded. Apply
   the generic stock number to end items of equipment when a number of production models are
   or will be available which are functionally interchangeable and must be identified separately.
   Show known national stock numbers (NSN) previously assigned to specific manufacturers
   for items applicable to a generic stock number on the PR. These are "stock as" stock numbers
   previously assigned to specific item(s) under the generic stock number.
   5.6.2. When an item with a generic stock number is being purchased, do not cite that number
   on the contract. Cite on the contract either the "stock as" stock number shown on the PR for
   the contractor, or an NC number which the buyer must obtain from the IM. Obtain the
   contractor's part number or other item references from the contractor during the solicitation.
   Before the award, give the IM the contractor's part number or other reference so an NC
   number can be obtained and included in the contract. Replacement of the generic stock
   number with a "stock as" stock number will not constitute a reason to return the PR to the
   requirements activity for rework.
   5.6.3. Upon receipt of the stock number replacement notification, the data entry personnel
   will notify the requirements activity citing the information received from the buyer. The
   requirements activity will make sure the generic stock number is replaced in the J041 system
   with the selected "stock as" stock number.
   5.6.4. It is important that contracts not be awarded citing a generic stock number. Since the
   "stock as" stock number is required for logistic management, the contract will not process
   through the J041 system to postaward until the specific stock number is input. If this is not
   included in the contract, contracting buying personnel must obtain the proper stock number
   from the requirements activity and issue a contract modification.
5.7. Contracts and Orders Not Accepted by Contractor After Distribution. When a
contractual action is not accepted by the contractor after the document has been distributed, the
buyer will:
   5.7.1. Contact the item manager to determine if the requirement is still valid.
       5.7.1.1. If the requirement is no longer valid, take no further action to reactivate the
       purchase request.
       5.7.1.2. If the requirement is still valid, coordinate with IM to reinstate PR in J041.
   5.7.2. Prepare and send a change order to cancel the contractual document. Use the change
   order later to delete the contractual due-in records from J041.
   5.7.3. When reprocurement action is to be taken (requirement still valid), start such action
   immediately.
5.8. Preaward and History Interrogation Capability. Contact the local data entry personnel
for a procurement history record (PHR): History is requested through J018R CIDS.
   5.8.1. If desired, the buyer or central contracting manager should contact the data entry
   personnel who will interrogate J018 CIDS to produce a replenishment spare PHR or a
   modification or repair PHR on a specific NSN.
AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                                23


5.9. Contract Options. The system provides for alerting the item manager and a buyer that a
contract should be reviewed for exercise of an option or follow-on requirement, if the date for
the exercise has previously been appropriately input to J041. Input these dates either at contract
award time by using the AFMC Form 453A, B, or C, or subsequently by file maintenance action
to the active contract record. A monthly product, Contract Options Expirations (J041.5YA or
J018R version J018R.5YA-Monthly), will list those contracts having dates expiring within 0 to
90 days from the output of the product.

                                           Chapter 6

              PREPARING AFMC FORM 453, BUYER DATA ABSTRACT

6.1. General. Use the AFMC Form 453 to submit codes and data from the buyer to J041 data
entry personnel. The data fields shown on the form, at both document and line item level, are
best known by the buyer. It is important the buyer prepare the form accurately and in a timely
manner so the data entry is not delayed when the contract is being abstracted to the J041 system.
6.2. Instructions on Preparing the AFMC Form 453A, AFMC FORM 453B, and AFMC
FORM 453C.
   6.2.1. Check the proper block for each data element. This form is required for every
   contract/modification action generated in contracting with the exception of the automated
   DD Form 1155 and non-PR actions, which do not impact obligated dollars.
   6.2.2. Due to limitations on the form for entering line item data, use extra forms when the
   number of contract line items exceeds the number of available blocks. In such cases, use the
   reverse side of the form only and enter PIIN, BRANCH/BUYER CODE, and the page
   number at the top of the page. If the line item data are the same for all line items on the form,
   complete all blocks under the CLIN (normally 0001) and check the box "L/I DATA SAME
   FOR ALL L/I". Line item data must be prepared for each line item in a contact or order
   purchasing hardware or services, except for those data which apply to more than one line
   item. It is also required for contract or order modifications when information involves a new
   kind of item or changes to previously established data.
   6.2.3. Instructions for Completing the Forms.
       6.2.3.1. Type Contractor Code: Code is mandatory for all actions. Type Business Code is
       automatically converted from this code.
       6.2.3.2. Type Instrument: This code is mandatory for all basic documents, contracts,
       orders, orders against basic documents, modifications. Not applicable when selecting
       type contractor code "I".
       6.2.3.3. PIIN Number: Enter the contract/order/ modification number of the document
       being abstracted.
       6.2.3.4. Exception Reason: This is an optional field. Buyer/contracting officer may use
       this field if action is delinquent and exception code was not previously input. Do not
       enter rework codes.
       6.2.3.5. Reserved.

                                          Chapter 7

                                   EXCEPTION REASONS

7.1. Explanation and Special Guidelines:
   7.1.1. Purpose of the Exception Reason Code. Exception reason codes identify, within the
   system records, the reason a contracting action is not completed within the standard time
   frame allowed for the contracting cycle involved.
   7.1.2. Using Exception Reason Codes:
       7.1.2.1. Optional. J041 coding personnel may input any valid exception reason code to
       the system when it becomes appropriate to describe a cause for delay in completing the
       contracting action.
       7.1.2.2. These codes take precedence over optional codes above.
          7.1.2.2.1. Codes 53 and 65. When a delay in excess of 7 days has occurred and one
          of these codes is the predominant reason, immediately input the exception reason
          code to the system regardless of the point in the cycle (except code 65 which is to be
          input only when the solicitation is awaiting MS 11.)
          7.1.2.2.2. Documents Distributed Delinquent in Cycle. Always input to the system
          the exception code identifying the predominant reason for the delinquency, when a
          document is delinquent in cycle at distribution time. Documents are considered
          distributed when a mailing date is affixed and the required copies placed in the proper
          mail and distribution channels, regardless of the date of necessary data input for
          system update purposes. NOTE: A delinquent action will not abstract to post-award
          unless an exception reason code is input.
   7.1.3. Special Guidelines for Selected Exception Reason Codes:
       7.1.3.1. Local option (codes 49, 68, 69). If no other single exception reason code
       adequately describes the predominant reason for a delinquency, you may use these codes
       to depict this condition. Always document the reason(s) outside the system when these
       codes are used for possible future management review. Local management will closely
       monitor the use of these codes to ensure they are used only where necessary. When a
       single condition (or a single combination of conditions) does not have unique code
       assigned but does account for at least five percent of all delinquent actions over an
       extended period (3 or more months), document details to HQ AFMC/PKX and request
       assignment of a unique code.
       7.1.3.2. Awaiting Funds Exception Reason 65 (Contracting holding PR).
          7.1.3.2.1. Procedures:
              7.1.3.2.1.1. ERC 65 will be used when all administrative details, except for funds
              commitment, to process a contract award have been completed. If contracting is
              awaiting funds, ERC 65 will stop document aging.
              7.1.3.2.1.2. The MS 07 must have been processed.
AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                             29


              7.1.3.2.1.3. If a PR must be returned after ERC 65 has been input, return the PR
              under ERCs 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, or 8J.
              7.1.3.2.1.4. Upon completion of MS 11 the number of days between ERC 65 date
              and contract award date will be subtracted from the days in cycle.
              7.1.3.2.1.5. Other ERCs will not be accepted after ERC 65 has been input, except
              "MP".
              7.1.3.2.1.6. Develop local procedures to ensure this ERC use is not abused. This
              will be included as an item in the local self-inspection checklist.
7.2. Exception Reason Transaction Preparation. Consider whether the PR/MIPR document
is still in PR/MIPR status or has advanced to solicitation or to PIIN status prior to assigning
ERC.

              PR/MIPR AND AMENDMENTS RETURNED FOR REWORK

8.1. General. Occasionally, the buyer may find, after receiving a PR/MIPR, that some
significant deficiency exists which precludes further contracting action until the deficiency is
corrected. A PR/MIPR and its essential associated supporting data deficiencies, which require
further requirements activity action, are covered here. Minor deficiencies or editorial errors,
particularly those not requiring more information or initiation of a PR/MIPR amendment, should
be manually updated by the buyer at IM request. If an update affects data within the J041 system
record(s), immediately provide information to the IM for appropriate system record correction.
8.2. Use of Exception (Return) Reason Codes. Each PR/MIPR and amendment returned must
have a reason for return. Exception reason codes 70 through 87 and 8J, identifies the most
frequently applicable reasons for return.
8.3. Restrictions on Return of PR/MIPR and Amendments:
   8.3.1. A basic PR/MIPR, to be eligible for return, must have been picked up (MS 00
   processed) by contracting, and cannot be partially or totally on contract.
   8.3.2. Do not return an amendment (as a unique document) after the amendment record
   within the system has been consolidated with the basic PR/MIPR record. Depending on the
   nature of the amendment, this will occur when the MS 00 is processed for amendments not
   affecting line item quantity or for those just adding a new line item, and when the MS 02 is
   processed for amendments affecting quantity on previously established line items.
8.4. Effect of Returns for Rework on Document Accountability and Delinquency
Reporting:
   8.4.1. When a basic PR/MIPR is returned for rework, contracting accountability for it ceases
   until it is returned to contracting (or a cancellation amendment is processed). While in
   rework, the PR/MIPR will continue to appear on the Contracting Status by Buyer Report
   with rework status indicated, but no contracting processing time will be charged for this
   period. When the PR/MIPR is returned from rework, contracting accountability for it
   resumes as does the time count. When delinquencies are computed, time spent in rework
   status will be deducted from total elapsed time to determine if the standard time is exceeded.
   When return was based on reason codes 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, or 8J, aging will resume the day
   after receipt back in P. At that time, the document will automatically be at day 0 in the
   selected cycle. Previous processing time will not be considered since it is assumed a new or
   revised solicitation will be required.
   8.4.2. Amendment Processing. When an amendment is received in contracting, the buyer
   must either accept or reject the amendment.
       8.4.2.1. To accept the amendment, process a MS 02 transaction. After the amendment
       MS 02 has been processed, no other action can be processed against the amendment.
       8.4.2.2. If the amendment is rejected, the buyer will inform data entry personnel, who
       will delete the amendment from the system. This must be done prior to MS 02
AFMCMAN64-104V2 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                           31


     transaction. If the MS 02 has processed, the buyer must coordinate with the item manager
     for a cancellation amendment.

  PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING SURGE/TRANSFER PURCHASE REQUESTS

9.1. General. This chapter provides procedures for processing purchase requests (PRs) received
from the inventory management (IM) ALC when a surge capability, either exercise or actual, is
required; and inventory management responsibilities are retained by the prime ALC.
9.2. Responsibilities.
   9.2.1. Assign buying personnel processing Surge or Transfer PRs a unique buyer code for
   these actions. The special code should be developed as follows:
       9.2.1.1. If a new branch is set up to process these actions, then the first or branch
       position, that is, 2--, must not duplicate any other buying branch at the PO-ALC.
       9.2.1.2. If only additional or pseudo buying sections are to be utilized then the first or
       branch position will remain the same. The second or section position of the buyer code
       will be revised, that is, 3G-3V. If a new section is developed, the third or buyer position
       of the code will be assigned in the normal manner. If the new section is really a pseudo
       section, then the same buying personnel will process Surge and Internal PRs, that is 3GH-
       3VH.
   9.2.2. The assigned surge buyers will receive their PRs in the normal manner. Any problems
   or difference of PR structure and data should be discussed with the PACER_____ control
   office.
   9.2.3. AFMC Form 376, AFMC 376 Administrative Commitment Document, when required
   will be processed in accordance with the ALC procedures.
       9.2.3.1. PACER ___ Purchase Requests (PRs) in process by the purchasing office (PO)-
       ALC citing stock funds Budget Program Activity Code (BPAC) FD20____ with Material
       Program Code (MPC) IN____ may be obligated if aggregate amount involved is not
       more than $25,000 without submission of an ACD to the IM-ALC.
       9.2.3.2. An ACD is still required on all PRs citing stock funds BPAC FD20____ with
       MPC.1D____, 1P____ and 1W____ regardless of dollar value. Send ACD to IM-ALC
       requirements activity.
       9.2.3.3. ACDs are still required on all PRs citing investment funds or depot maintenance
       industrial funds (DMIF) for which funds were not committed on the PR. Send ACD to
       IM-ALC accounting activity.
       9.2.3.4. ACDs are still required on PRs citing foreign military sales (FMS) direct site
       funds (BPAC 4F9999) for which funds were not committed on the PRs. Send ACD to
       IM-ALC requirements activity.

  9.2.4. Discuss questions relating to Surge PRs with the item manager at the IM-ALC.
  9.2.5. Buying personnel will identify PRs "PACER___" and return to IM for resolution.
  Notify data entry personnel to process PRs in rework status in J041.
