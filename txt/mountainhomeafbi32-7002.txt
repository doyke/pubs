    2.6. Each office notified should send similar notification to all hazardous waste generators

       coordinate inspection schedule changes. Disclose the phone number or radio channel of
       the inspection team at the in-brief.
       2.7.3. Answer questions truthfully and explain processes openly. Do not guess at
       answers or provide unsolicited information. If a team member is not certain of an
       answer, they should answer that they will research the question and provide an answer as

       2.7.6. Ask inspectors for regulation references for each noted violation. If you have

    out-brief to wing leadership. The out-brief will include:
