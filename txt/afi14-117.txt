      received appropriate specialized targeting training, either through Combat Targeting Course
      (CTC), or the appropriate successor beginning/intermediate/advanced courses, or the Joint
      Targeting School (JTS), prior to assuming their duties. Personnel performing geopositioning

       coordinate derivation require training and certification IAW CJCSI 3505.01. Personnel
       performing Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) require training IAW CJCSI 3160.01.
       1.12.3. Submit targeting and geopositioning experience billet/position requirements to
       MAJCOMs and AFPC for satisfaction. To the maximum extent possible, personnel in these
       billets will acquire the Targeting SEI within one year and maintain qualification for the targeting
       SEI while in this billet.
2. AF Targeting References and Considerations.
    2.1. Doctrine. Two foundational documents provide the doctrinal underpinnings for targeting,
    describe core processes, and outline planning/execution considerations to successfully conduct all
    aspects of the targeting cycle. They are AFDD 2-1.9, Targeting and Joint Publication 3-60, Joint
    Targeting. All personnel involved in the AF targeting will thoroughly read and understand the
    contents of these two publications. Additionally, CJCSI 3160.01, No-Strike and The Collateral
    Damage Estimation Methodology (U); CJCSI 3505.01, Target Coordinate Mensuration
    Certification; and CJCSI 3122.06B, Sensitive Target Approval Process (U) (classified), are essential
    references.
    2.2. Organization.
       2.2.1. Principal Coordinating Effort. Targeting requires a wide range of support from the
       National Intelligence Community (IC); as well as, many DoD operational and intelligence
       organizations. The Joint Staff Deputy Directorate for Targeting (J2T) serves as a key facilitator
       among the various targeting service staffs, combatant commands, DoD organizations and the IC,
       to ensure a coordinated approach to this inherently joint activity. It most often uses the Military
       Target Intelligence Management Structure (MTIMS), chartered by the DoD Military Intelligence
       Board (MIB), to do so. Within the MTIMS is a senior leadership (O-6) level forum called the
       MTC, which serves as an advisory body to the MIB, combatant commands, services and defense
       agencies. It provides the means to discuss, coordinate, and determine actions needed to resolve
       target intelligence issues related to Doctrine, Organization, Training Materiel, Leadership &
       Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) areas. Representatives from the Joint Staff,
       combatant commands, Services and Allied Partners make up the membership. Supporting the
       MTC are two action-officer level groups, the TIWG and the JTASG. The TIWG and JTASG
       report issue findings and recommendations to the MTC as directed. HQ USAF/A2CPA
       represents the Air Force in this joint forum, but relies heavily on experts across the Air Force.
       2.2.2. Additional Targeting Expertise. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), National
       Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), National Security Agency (NSA), National
       Reconnaissance Office (NRO), Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness
       (JTCG/ME), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Warfare Analysis Center
       (JWAC) all perform missions dedicated to supporting national, theater and joint targeting efforts.
       Additionally, the combatant commands’ intelligence organizations perform theater-level target
       production and analysis. Furthermore, each service maintains research labs and weapons
       development organizations that significantly influence targeting capabilities and processes.
       Consult current SIPRNET or JWICS organizational web pages for details on their capabilities.
    2.3. Training.
       2.3.1. Targeting AFSC-Awarding/Initial Skills Training. Personnel performing functions
       supporting the targeting cycle require specialized knowledge, skills and in many cases,
       certification beyond their respective AF Specialty Code (AFSC)-awarding training.
AFI14-117 13 May 2009                                                                                 9


      Commanders should send individuals performing targeting functions to one of the following
      formal training courses as part of an individual’s Initial Qualification Training (IQT).
         2.3.1.1. The Basic Targeting Course (BTC), will be available for enlisted pipeline and non-
         ISR personnel. It is part of the enlisted Targeting AFSC technical training and is an AFSC-
         awarding course.
         2.3.1.2. The USAF operates the Combat Targeting Course (CTC) run by the 17th Training
         Wing at Goodfellow AFB and overseen by HQ AETC, to provide initial training for
         targeting-related duties. Personnel attending this course receive in-depth training on
         applicable targeting processes and procedures. The CTC will transition to two courses, the
         Targeting IFTU and Advanced Targeting Course (ATC). The Targeting IFTU will be for
         ISR officers or mid-level enlisted ISR retrainees going to or performing targeting duties at a
         wing or AOC.
         2.3.1.3. Joint Targeting School (JTS). This school is designed to teach the joint targeting
         process (based on JP 3-60). The USAF recommends this course for those mid-career ISR
         Airmen going to a combatant command, Joint Staff, or CSA targeting billet; or for those who
         are unable to attend AF targeting training. USJFCOM oversees JTS at its joint training
         facility in Dam Neck VA.
         2.3.1.4. Weaponeering. Air Force targeting courses, the Conventional Weaponeering
         Fundamentals Mobile Training Team, and JTS teach weaponeering basics as part of their
         curriculum. This training is JTCG/ME-approved and is an essential requirement to properly
         use the JMEM Weaponeering System and Integrated Munitions Effects Assessment program
         for respective targets.
         2.3.1.5. Additional IQT training for personnel may be required beyond BTC, CTC
         (Targeting IFTU), or JTS. IAW AFI 14-202 Vol 1, personnel will also complete the IQT
         program for the weapon systems/mission areas to which they are assigned (e.g., F-15E, F-16,
         AOC, etc.).
      2.3.2. Targeting-specific Mission Qualification Training (MQT), Continuation Training (CT),
      and Specialized Training. Targeting-related MQT will be conducted at an individual’s specific
      unit/organization they are assigned to. Targeting-related CT will ensure personnel maintain the
      required proficiency at their assigned qualification level. For some specific targeting positions,
      individuals will also require specialized training/certification, either as part of MQT or after
      completion of their MQT.
         2.3.2.1. Geopositioning. CJCSI 3505.01 requires training and certification of ISR Airmen to
         conduct precise geolocation positioning for unguided and guided munitions delivery. Precise
         Point Positioning Process Certification (4PC) is conducted by NGA and/or NGA-accredited
         organizations. The 20 IS is designated to be the primary Air Force accredited organization
         conducting 4PC certification.
         2.3.2.2. The Advanced Targeting Course (ATC) has been proposed as a follow-on course to
         BTC and the Targeting IFTU. The ATC is intended for officers and enlisted personnel in
         key targeting wing or AOC billets that require in-depth comprehension of targeting cycle
         functions and their integration in the planning process.
      2.3.3. Consult AFI 36-2201V2, Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA)
      website, or the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA/unit training websites/managers for more information on
      training requirements.

     2.4. Materiel.
        2.4.1. Automation. Targeting is an information intensive process. National/theater databases
        containing targeting related reference material have tens of thousands of records. It is essential
        that targeting professionals emphasize the need to continually improve the automation of core
        targeting tasks that preserve the integrity, fidelity and pedigree of targeting information. AF
        targeting automation efforts will have several objectives:
            2.4.1.1. Ensure a means to add, update and maintain the databases, and allow linkages that
            tie all parts of the targeting cycle together (e.g. link an objective and measure of success to
            individual weapon aimpoint).
            2.4.1.2. Allow transfer of essential targeting data (e.g. description and precise geolocation)
            with minimal to no human intervention (except to check data accuracy) between intelligence,
            C2 and operations systems to reduce chances of introducing errors into the data.
            2.4.1.3. Provide a means to visualize and display target systems and relationships to other
            systems.
            2.4.1.4. Reduce the time needed to accomplish all of the targeting cycle steps.
     2.5. Leadership.
        2.5.1. Targeting is a command function and is inherently joint. It requires commander oversight
        and involvement to ensure proper execution. It is not the exclusive province of one type of
        specialty or division, such as intelligence or operations, but is the blending of expertise from
        many disciplines across the joint force. As an example, targeting-proficient personnel are
        normally found in most Air & Space Operations Center divisions vice a single division.
        Targeting has long been a USAF core competency (AFDD 2-1.9).
        2.5.2. Targeting Community of Practice (CoP). HQ AF/A2CPA maintains a Targeting CoP on
        the AF Portal CoP link. The CoP is a repository of useful unclassified reference material
        covering a range of targeting issues from doctrine review and TTPs to history of targeting. This
        is an essential reference for targeting professionals and provides a unique forum to exchange
        targeting related data. Of note: JS/J2T also maintains extensive targeting related information on
        their SIPRNET and JWICS web pages.
     2.6. Personnel. Upon completion of an AF-approved targeting course, follow-on OJT and practical
     experience in a specified targeting position, personnel become eligible for award of a targeting
     Special Experience Identifier (SEI). Specific guidance for award and retention of targeting SEIs are
     contained in the Enlisted Classification Directory and Officer Classification Directory available on-
     line at: http://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/.
     2.7. Facility. Not used.
