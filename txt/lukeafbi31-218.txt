4.2. Installation Traffic Codes. Installation Commander or designee will establish a traffic
code for operation of motor vehicles on the installation. Traffic codes will contain the rules of
the road (parking violations, towing instructions, safety equipment, and other key provisions).
Violations of state traffic codes are applicable to base driving records when the offense is
included in the state‘s criminal offense. This provision is covered under the authority of Title 18
United States Code 13 (USC).
   4.2.1. The Traffic code for Luke AFB is contained in Attachment 3.
   4.2.2. The local policies detailing traffic stop, inspection, search, towing, and impoundment
   of vehicles are governed by SOI 31-1, Security and LE Operations.
   4.2.3. Vehicle stereo systems will not be played at a volume that prohibits the vehicle
   operator from hearing approaching emergency vehicles or other warning devices. Stereos
   will not be played at such a volume that they can be heard by an individual outside the
   vehicle at a distance of 50 feet or more. Reference: Glendale City Ordinances, Chapter 25,
   Article V, Section 25-67. Repeated responses may require abatement by law enforcement
   personnel, to include confiscation of equipment.
   4.2.4. Individuals cited for failure to produce valid driver‘s license, vehicle registration, or
   proof of insurance will report to the BDOC on the next duty day with the required

   valid driver‘s license or insurance, revocation or suspension action will be initiated by 56
   SFS/S5AR.
   4.2.5. Individuals cited for mandatory vehicle equipment violations will report to the BDOC
   at bldg #179 within 72 hours with proof of corrective action. If the 72-hour period has
   passed, and the individuals have not shown proof of corrective action, the ticket will be
   processed for commander‘s action.
4.3. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
   4.3.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within
   traffic laws and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective
   enforcement should emphasize voluntary compliance by drivers and can be achieved by the
   following actions:
       4.3.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.
       4.3.1.2. Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with National
       Health and Safety Performance Standards and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
       Devices for Streets and Highways.
       4.3.1.3. Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with
       drivers and act promptly when driving behavior is improper or a defective vehicle is
       observed in operation.
       4.3.1.4. Maintaining an aggressive program to detect and apprehend persons who drive
       while privileges are suspended or revoked.
       4.3.1.5. Using sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue
       citations, or warn the offender.
LUKEAFBI31-218 25 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                17


   4.3.2. Selective enforcement will be used when practical. Selective enforcement deters
   traffic violations and reduces accidents by the presence or suggested presence of law
   enforcement personnel at places where violations, congestion, or accidents frequently occur.
   Selective enforcement applies proper enforcement measures to traffic congestion and focuses
   on selected time periods, conditions, and violations that cause accidents. Law enforcement
   personnel use selective enforcement because that practice is the most effective use of
   resources. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
       4.3.2.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the
       influence of alcohol or drugs.
       4.3.2.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement techniques.
       4.3.2.3. Enforcing BAC standards.
       4.3.2.4. Denying installation driving privileges to persons whose use of alcohol or other
       drugs prevents safe operation of a motor vehicle.
4.4. Speed-Measuring Devices. Speed measuring devices will be used in traffic control studies
and enforcement programs. Signs may be posted to indicate speed measuring devices are being
used.
4.5. Traffic Accident Investigation. Installation law enforcement personnel must make
detailed investigations of major accidents.
   4.5.1. Security Forces will not conduct off-base accident investigations.
   4.5.2. Security Forces will respond to all on-base major accidents (see paragraph 4.6.1.). For
   minor vehicle accidents, the driver(s) will report to the BDOC located at bldg #179
   immediately to fill out and exchange the accident information and accomplish AF Form
   1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/Complainant, as necessary, for insurance purposes.
4.6. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.6.1. Major Vehicle Accidents: 56 SFS will accomplish detailed reports via AF Form 1315,
   Accident Report, for all major accidents. NOTE: Generally, a detailed accident
   investigation includes, but is not limited to, an accident field report, sketch or diagram, and
   an accident narrative. Major traffic accident is defined as follows; accidents involving a
   fatality or personal injury, whether apparent or complaints of injury, accidents resulting in
   vehicle or government property damage in excess of $10,000, accidents causing the vehicle
   to be disabled, accident that cannot be easily explained.
   4.6.2. Minor Vehicle Accident: Drivers or owners of POVs will be required to submit a
   written report to the BDOC within 24 hours of an accident. Information obtained will state
   whether (a) the accident occurs on the installation; (b) the accident involves no personal
   injury; and (c) the accident involves only minor damage to the POV and the vehicle can be
   safely and normally driven from the scene under its own power.
       4.6.2.1. Information in the written report cannot be used in criminal proceedings against
       the person submitting it unless it was originally categorized a hit and run and the violator
       is the person submitting the report.
       4.6.2.2. Rights advisement will be given prior to any criminal traffic statements provided
       by violators.

       4.6.2.3. Within the United States, the installation law enforcement official may require
       such reporting on Service forms or forms of the State jurisdiction. Reports will include
       the following about the accident:
          4.6.2.3.1. Location, date, and time.
          4.6.2.3.2. Identification of all drivers, pedestrians, and passengers involved.
          4.6.2.3.3. Identification of vehicles involved.
          4.6.2.3.4. Direction and speed of travel of each vehicle involved, including a sketch
          of the collision and roadway with street names and north arrow.
          4.6.2.3.5. Property damage involved.
          4.6.2.3.6. Environmental conditions at the time of the incident (weather, visibility,
          road surface condition, and other factors).
          4.6.2.3.7. A narrative description of the events and circumstances concerning the
          accident.
4.7. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data.
   4.7.1. Analyze data derived from traffic accident investigation to determine accident causes.
   When frequent accidents occur in one area, analyze location conditions, type of accidents,
   and other factors in an attempt to isolate causes. With the exception of privacy act
   information, make accident data and trend analysis available to agencies requesting the data
   for reporting and analytical purposes. With the exception of requests filed under the
   Freedom of Information Act, the SFS/CC determines the agencies cleared to receive accident
   and incident data.
   4.7.2. Security Forces personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation reports
   will indicate if a seat restraint was utilized at that time of the accident and where applicable,
   if air bags were deployed.
4.8. Parking.
   4.8.1. Guidance for discretion of enforcers and limiting of towing and booting to specific
   offenses is covered under 56 SFS SOI 31-1, Security and LE Operations.
4.9. Traffic Violation Reports.
   4.9.1. The DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, is utilized at Luke AFB for all
   traffic violations on the installation. The Security Forces Training Section (56 SFS/S3T) will
   provide training on proper utilization of the form to all 56 SFS personnel before they are
   released to their respective flights. Personnel other than 56 SFS who have been designated to
   write DD Forms 1408 (e.g., building custodian, parking warden.) will also be trained by 56
   SFS/S3T.
   4.9.2. Since tickets require command action, the violator‘s unit commander must sign them.
   First sergeants or other personnel may complete the administrative process of the ticket;
   however, the commander must sign the ticket IAW AFMAN 31-201, v7, para 2.1.3.1.
   4.9.3. Traffic Ticket Rebuttal Process: All traffic ticket rebuttals must be submitted in
   writing within 10 days from the date of the citation. Rebuttal requests received after 10 days

   are not in compliance with AFMAN 31-201 v7, Security Forces Administration and Reports,
   and will not be processed. The memorandum of rebuttal must be signed by the individual,
   endorsed by his or her commander and forwarded to Security Forces Reports and Analysis
   section. Security Forces Operations will gather additional data and provide a
   recommendation to the Security Forces Commander. The Security Force Commander will
   determine validity of if the ticket will be voided. Security Forces Reports and Analysis will
   notify the offender of the determination of the Security Force Commanders decision.
   4.9.4. Serious traffic offenses (e.g., DWI, vehicular homicide, and so forth) involving non-
   DoD affiliated personnel will be referred to civil law enforcement authorities. Security
   Forces will obtain sufficient information for a comprehensive report and forward this to the
   installation commander or designated representative for action necessitated by the military.
4.10. Training of Law Enforcement for Processing Drunk Drivers.
   4.10.1. Security Forces members will be trained by Arizona Department of Public Safety
   and are certified by the Arizona Department of Health to operate the Intoxilyzer 8000.
   Individuals will attend refresher training as required.

NOTE: Individuals may be charged with DUI even if below the .08% presumptive legal limit.
When a driver‘s ability is shown to be impaired through other testing, they will be apprehended
or detained for DUI.
4.11. Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards.
   4.11.1. Administrative revocation of driving privileges and other enforcement measures will
   be applied uniformly to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a
   person is tested under the implied consent provisions of paragraph 2–3, the results of the test
   will be evaluated as follows
4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
   4.12.1. Breath tests to determine alcohol content will be administered at Luke AFB by

                  DRIVING RECORDS AND TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Unit commanders, first sergeants, or individuals designated in writing by their unit
commander may review driving records of personnel assigned to their unit. Civilian law
enforcement investigators, military investigators, and 56 FW/SE personnel may review records
with proper identification and official requirement.

Table 5.1. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges.
 Assessment 1: 1 year revocation of driving privileges.
 Violation:
 - Operating a motor vehicle with a student driver’s permit without a licensed driver in the
 vehicle.
 - Operating a motor vehicle without a driver’s permit ever being issued. For drivers under the
 age of 16 years old, the suspension or revocation will begin on the first day they would
 normally become eligible for a license.
 - Driving with a suspended driver’s license.
 Assessment 2: 1-year suspension or revocation of driving privileges.
 Violation:
 - Operating a vehicle with an alcohol content level of 0.08% or higher (DUI).
 - DUI - BrAC/BAC at least .05% but less than .08% combined with other related factors which
 results in DUI (not DWI) being charged.
 - Knowingly permitting an unlicensed driver or a driver whose driving privileges were
 suspended or revoked, to operate a motor vehicle.
 - Refusal to submit to installation entry point checks.
 - Accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic points within
 24 consecutive months.
 Assessment 3: (Luke AFB). 6-month revocation of driving privileges.
 Violation:
 - Operating a motor vehicle with expired insurance or registration.
 Assessment 4: 2-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation
 commander or designee (56 MSG/CC).
 Violation:
 - Driving on base while installation driving privileges are under suspension or revocation.
NOTE 1. If revocation for implied consent is combined with driving under the influence,
revocation runs consecutively for a total of 24 months.
NOTE 2. In cases of multiple suspensions or revocations, the periods will run consecutively.
5.2. Traffic Citation Rebuttal Procedures. The action authority for traffic citations is
delegated to the unit commander of the alleged offender. The unit commander will annotate
action taken, if any, on the traffic citation. This policy restricts first sergeants from performing
and signing for action taken on the traffic citations of enlisted members of the unit who choose
not to rebut the citation. Members who rebut citations will prepare a written statement detailing
 22                                                 LUKEAFBI31-218 25 SEPTEMBER 2013


the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the citation and why he/she believes the violation
should be dismissed. If the unit commander agrees, the commander will forward information to
the Security Forces, Reports and Analysis section. Reports and Analysis personnel will obtain a
written statement from the patrol person issuing the citation and forward the information to the
56 SFS/CC. If the 56 SFS/CC feels the citation was in error, the process will end there.
However, if the 56 SFS/CC feels the citation should stand, all information will be forwarded to
the 56 MSG/CC, who will in turn, determine the guilt or innocence. The 56 MSG/CC will be the
final authority.
5.3. Non-moving Violations. The provisions listed below apply to citations issued by Security
Forces via, DD Form 1408, issued by parking wardens. Non-moving citations issued outside the
jurisdiction of Luke AFB are not considered under the accumulative provision listed below.
When the operator is unidentified, the registered owner will be cited for the nonmoving
violation, unless a written statement is provided within 5 workdays from the date of the citation
by the registered owner that another individual was operating the motor vehicle and concurrence
of that individual is reflected on the written statement. In this case, the 56 SFS/CC will evaluate
the citation and cite the responsible individual. For GOVs, the responsible identified operator
will be cited under this paragraph. The following mandatory administrative actions, in addition
to any appropriate disciplinary action by the respective commander, will be taken when persons
subject to this instruction have accumulated the number of nonmoving violations indicated
during a 12-month period.
   5.3.1. Third nonmoving violation: Suspended from driving on base for 30 days.
   5.3.2. Fourth nonmoving violation: Suspended from driving on base for 6 months.
   5.3.3. Fifth nonmoving violation: Suspended from driving on base indefinitely.
   5.3.4. First handicap violation: Warning letter sent to the individual concerned.
   5.3.5. Second handicap violation: 60-day suspension of on-base driving privileges.
   5.3.6. Third handicap violation: 1-year suspension of on-base driving privileges.
5.4. Seatbelts/Child Restraint Devices. It is the responsibility of the vehicle operator to ensure
all occupants are using seat belts and/or child restraint devices. Failure to use seat belts and/or
child restraints while the vehicle is in motion will result in the following actions against the
vehicle operator:
   5.4.1. First offense: Mandatory counseling by assigned unit.
   5.4.2. Second offense: 30-day suspension of on-base driving privileges.
   5.4.3. Third offense: 6-month suspension of on-base driving privileges.
   5.4.4. Fourth offense: 1-year revocation of on-base driving privileges.
5.5. Parking Wardens.
   5.5.1. Security force units have developed local procedures to develop a Parking Warden
   program. Parking Wardens must be delegated by individual unit commanders, in writing, for
   participation in the program. Reports and Analysis section will obtain a letter with the
   current monitors and maintain the letter on file. The letter should specify a minimum of one
   primary and alternate in the grade of E-5 (Civilian Equivalent) or above. Parking Wardens
LUKEAFBI31-218 25 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                               23


   are the commander's representative to issue citations for parking violations in areas under the
   control of their commander. Wardens will issue parking tickets via DD Form 1408.
   5.5.2. Parking wardens will be trained by Security Forces training personnel on the correct
   way to complete DD Forms 1408. The main difference between a DD Form 1408 issued by
   a Security Forces member and one issued by a parking warden are special instructions on the
   back of the pink copy that directs the violator to contact the parking warden who issued the
   ticket instead of SFS/S5AR. It is important that parking wardens include how or where they
   can be reached by the violators. When contacted by the violator, the parking warden will fill
   in any missing data in sections 1-10.
   5.5.3. Tickets that are incomplete, over 30-days old or were written by personnel not
   designated as parking wardens will not be processed and will be returned to the unit with no
   action taken by Security Forces.
5.6. Moving Violations. The following actions will be taken on the accumulation of identified
number of points:
   5.6.1. Accumulation of 6 to 11 Traffic Points. An advisory email will be forwarded with
   read receipt to the individual through his/her unit first sergeant. The unit commander or
   civilian supervisor will counsel the individual on the penalties that could be imposed on
   them.
   5.6.2. Accumulation of 12 or more traffic points. When 12 or more traffic points are
   accumulated within 12 months (1 continuous year), the person‘s driving privileges will be
   suspended for a period of 6 months.
   5.6.3. Accumulation of 18 or more traffic points. When 18 or more traffic points are
   accumulated within 24 months (2 continuous years), the person‘s driving privileges will be
   suspended for a period of 1 year.
   5.6.4. The point system applies to military personnel, dependents, civilian employees, and
   all other individuals subject to AFI 31-201, Security Police Standards and Procedures,
   operating POVs on and off the installation.
   5.6.5. The 56 SFS/CC and the issuing security forces member are authorized to void the DD
   Form 1408.
   5.6.6. Unit commanders will be notified when an individual accumulates six or more traffic
   points within a 6-month period.
   5.6.7. Upon receipt of driver records or a Security Forces Management Information System
   (SFMIS) product for a person newly assigned to the installation, 56 SFS/S5AR forwards the
   record to the individual‘s unit commander for review.

                                           Chapter 6

                    IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. Abandoned Vehicles. A POV is deemed abandoned if left unattended for a period of 5
days. Building Custodians are responsible for identifying abandoned vehicles within their
respective parking lots. NOTE: If a vehicle is in the long-term parking lot with the appropriate
Security Forces paperwork displayed in the windshield it is not considered abandoned UNLESS
it is 10 or more duty days after the owner was supposed to have returned and the owner has not
made contact with Security Forces to request an extension.
   6.1.1. Once the vehicle has been identified as abandoned, a DD Form 1408 will be issued by
   the traffic wardens or Security Forces personnel. The pink copy will be affixed to the
   vehicle. If after 72 hours, the vehicle has not moved or the owner/operator has not contacted
   a law enforcement official, a DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice, will be placed in a
   protective plastic, along with DD Form 1408. An additional 72 hours will be given to the
   owner/operator to remove the vehicle or correct the violation. The instructions listed on DD
   Form 2504 must include contacting SF Investigations who is the focal point for removal of
   abandoned vehicles. The original and second copy of the DD Form 2504, the yellow and
   white copy of the DD Form 1408, along with a Law Enforcement Agencies Data System
   printout, will be given to Investigations for further processing.
6.2. Removal/Towing. Investigations will accomplish a DD Form 2505, Abandoned Vehicle
Removal authorization, and a DD Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report. A final attempt to
contact the owner will be made via certified mail. If the certified mail is returned, the on-call
tow company will be contacted and arrangements for the tow will be made.
   6.2.1. If the owner is identified after his/her vehicle is towed, that owner will be responsible
   for the necessary expenditures to the tow company in order to retrieve his/her vehicle.
   6.2.2. If the current location of a POV hinders safety, mission requirements, or tow-away
   zone, and must be relocated without delay, make all feasible attempts to locate the
   owner/operator of the vehicle. If contact cannot be made, the 56th Logistics Readiness
   Squadron or a commercial towing company will be contacted to tow the vehicle to a
   specified location. All costs for the towing and any damage caused to the vehicle will be
   incurred by the owner of the vehicle.
