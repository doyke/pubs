                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope and Purpose.
   1.1.1. This AFI provides guidance for developing an Airfield Driving Program (ADP) to
   provide safe ground vehicle operations and pedestrian control on USAF owned and/or
   operated airfields. It outlines training requirements for all personnel (e.g. military, DoD
   Civilians, Contractors, etc.) who, as a part of their job, are required to drive unescorted on an
   airfield.
   1.1.2. Personnel required to drive on the airfield must be knowledgeable of and comply with
   the procedures outlined in this AFI and locally developed Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).
   For the purpose of this AFI, the ADI is a wing or base level instruction.
   1.1.3. In today’s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft,
   pedestrians, and ground vehicles at USAF airfields that lead to property damage and
   personnel injury. One of the most hazardous incidents for an airfield driver to be involved
   with is a runway incursion. A runway incursion occurs when an aircraft, vehicle or person
   enters the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft
   without approval from Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). Runway incursions have the
   potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While there are several factors
   involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these incidents result from a failure to
   follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training, and loss of situational awareness.
   Therefore, strict adherence to the procedures in this AFI is essential to preventing aircraft-
   vehicle mishaps and personnel injury on the airfield.
   1.1.4. Shared-Use Airfields. Airfield Management (AM) personnel at shared-use airfields
   (e.g. Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve units) must work with the civil airport manager
   to develop and implement local airfield driving procedures where applicable.
   1.1.5. Contingency Locations. At contingency locations, the Senior Airfield Authority
   (SAA) or equivalent, may authorize deviations to airfield driving procedures outlined in this
   AFI to support tactical or combat operations/situations. Authority must not be delegated.
      1.1.5.1. In the interest of safety to airfield and flight operations, deviations to this AFI
      should be by exception only and include a Risk Management assessment. Factors to
      consider for deviations include but are not limited to the length of time the operation has
      been in place and available resources.
      1.1.5.2. If time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA or equivalent, forward proposed
      deviations to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, for an operational review.
      1.1.5.3. Provide the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, an informational copy of
      approved deviations to assist with establishing compliance priorities, providing oversight,
      and developing area of responsibility execution activities.
1.2. Waivers, Recommended Changes and Issuing New Airfield Driving Policy or
Procedures.
   1.2.1. Waivers.

       1.2.1.1. Waiver Authority. HQ AFFSA/A3A will provide waivers to this instruction
       only upon an official MAJCOM OPR for AO request when a requirement makes a waiver
       necessary or compliance with creates a hazard. HQ AFFSA/A3A grants waivers to this
       AFI for a period not to exceed two years.
       1.2.1.2. Waiver Process. AF IMT 4058, Airfield Operations Policy Waiver will be used
       to request waivers to this instruction. If additional space is required, annotate on plain
       bond paper and submit along with the form. Number each comment with the
       corresponding block number. In addition, units will submit an Operational Risk
       Management (ORM) Assessment in accordance with AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk
       Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools or alternate risk mitigation procedures with all
       waiver requests.
           1.2.1.2.1. All waiver requests to this instruction must be reviewed/coordinated on by
           the Wing Airfield Driving Program Manager (Wing ADPM), Airfield Operations
           Flight Commander (AOF/CC) and Wing Safety.
           1.2.1.2.2. The AOF/CC forwards the AF IMT 4058 through the Senior Operational
           Commander (e.g., OG/CC) to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, who will then
           review/coordinate and send to HQ AFFSA.
           1.2.1.2.3. Submit additional data (e.g., Letters of Procedure (LOP), airfield diagrams,
           etc.) to substantiate the waiver request as required.
       1.2.1.3. Submit waiver renewal requests to HQ AFFSA No Later Than (NLT) 30 days
       prior to expiration.
    1.2.2. Recommended Changes. Use the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of
    Publication to submit recommended changes to this AFI. Recommended changes must be
    coordinated on by the Wing ADPM, AOF/CC and host Wing/CC or equivalent then
    forwarded to the MAJCOM OPR for AO.               The MAJCOM OPR for AO will
    review/coordinate on proposed changes prior to forwarding to HQ AFFSA/A3A for final
    disposition.
    1.2.3. Issuing New Airfield Driving Policy or Procedures. In accordance with AFI 33-360,
    Publications Management Program, a Guidance Memorandum (GM) or Interim Change (IC)
    will be used to prescribe procedures and guidance pending revision of this AFI. New USAF
    procedures/guidance will be distributed through the MAJCOM OPR for AO. GMs and ICs
    will be posted on the AFDPO website until formalized in this publication.

                        AIRFIELD DRIVING INSTRUCTION (ADI)

3.1. General. This chapter provides specific requirements for developing and implementing an
ADI to control ground vehicles and equipment operating on the airfield.
3.2. ADI. The ADI must contain the following:
   3.2.1. Responsibilities. Outline wing and/or base level responsibilities of the key personnel
   involved in the ADP (e.g. Wing/CC, OG/CC, Unit/CC, AOF/CC, Wing ADPM, unit
   ADPMs, AM, SF, ATCT, Wing Safety, Hospital/Medical Treatment Facility).
   3.2.1. (VANCEAFB) Responsibilities are outlined in AFI 13-213, Chapter 2 and this
   supplement.
   3.2.2. AF IMT 483 Issuance. Outline wing and/or base level procedures for issuing an AF
   IMT 483 to base assigned personnel, TDY personnel and Non-base assigned contractors
   requiring airfield driving privileges. Include requirements for issuance of an AF IMT 483 to
   individuals requiring Non-CMA, CMA, Runway and restrictions as applicable (e.g. Ramp
   only, Daylight Hours only, etc.)
   3.2.2. (VANCEAFB) AF Form 483 (Airfield Drivers License) is issued to personnel only
   after all required training items prescribed by AFI 13-213 and this supplement have been
   accomplished. At Vance there are two types of airfield driver’s license: CMA Access and
   RAMP ONLY. Either of these may be restricted to DAYTIME ONLY. CMA Access
   requires the trainee complete all required training items on the Airfield Driving Training
   Documentation and Certification Checklist (Attachment 5) and pass a color vision test.
   RAMP ONLY requires the trainee to complete those items specific to operating a vehicle on
   the ramp. Color vision testing is not required. RAMP ONLY license restricts the driver to
   the ramp (flight line road to the west edge of the ramp) and is not authorized to operate a
   vehicle anywhere else on the airfield, i.e., taxiways, perimeter road and runways. DAYTIME
   ONLY authorizes the driver to operate a vehicle during daylight hours only. This restriction
   may be in conjunction with CMA Access or RAMP ONLY.
       3.2.2.1. The AFM, Wing ADPM, and other designated AM representatives are
       responsible for signing AF IMT 483s.
       3.2.2.2. Authority for signing AF IMT 483 must not be delegated outside AM.
       3.2.2.3. All base assigned personnel (e.g. military, DoD civilian, Contractor, etc.)
       required to operate a vehicle on the airfield, must complete all airfield drivers’ training
       and testing requirements outlined in this AFI and the ADI prior to issuance of an AF IMT
       483. Note: An AFSC or career field training (e.g. aircraft maintenance, aircrew, fire and
       emergency services, security forces, transportation, etc.) is not a substitute for completion
       of airfield driving training and testing requirements outlined in this AFI.
   3.2.3. Training criteria. Outline wing and/or base level airfield driving training
   requirements. All locally developed training curriculum and training materials, to include
   PowerPoint slides, videos, Computer Base Training (CBT), checklist(s), and lesson plan(s)
AFI13-213_VANCEAFBSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                        19

     and Training CoP), or electronic equivalent as an on-the-job training checklist/curriculum
     to conduct and document airfield drivers’ qualification training on all newly
     assigned/hired personnel. Units may incorporate local requirements to Airfield Driving
     Qualification Training Checklist (Curriculum) Checklist.
     3.2.3.2. (VANCEAFB) Units that have drivers that only utilize the ramp may use
     Airfield Driving Qualification Training Checklist (curriculum) ramp only. (Attachment
     6a).
     3.2.3.3. Completion of the USAF Airfield Driving CBT (accessible on the Advanced
     Distributed Learning Website, https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp) is
     required for all wing and/or base assigned airfield drivers prior to issuance of an AF IMT
     483. Note: Newly assigned or hired individuals may use a prior USAF Airfield Driving
     CBT completion date to fulfill this requirement if date completed is within the last 12
     months.
     3.2.3.3. (VANCEAFB) Once the USAF Airfield Driving CBT is completed provide a
     copy of the completion certificate to the Unit ADPM.
     3.2.3.4. Classroom training as determined locally.

        be escorted by a vehicle driver possessing a valid AF IMT 483 prior to entry to the
        airfield.
        3.2.7.1.1. (VANCEAFB) To operate a vehicle in the CMA, including acting as an
        escort, the driver must possess an AF Form 483 stamped ―CMA‖.
        3.2.7.1.2. Units sponsoring TDY personnel or Non-base assigned contractors are
        responsible for providing training or an escort that possesses a valid AF IMT 483.
     3.2.7.2. Procedures and standards for operating a vehicle on the CMA.
        3.2.7.2.1. No vehicle operator or pedestrian may enter the CMA without specific
        approval from the ATCT. Exception: Vehicles and/or pedestrians may be escorted
        into the CMA by another vehicle and/or pedestrian that has two-way radio contact
        with the ATCT.

        3.2.7.2.3. (VANCEAFB) Vehicles/Personnel must make initial contact with the
        control tower or RCS prior to entering the CMA and will maintain continual two-way
        radio contact while operating within the CMA. The fire department will monitor
        fire/crash frequency. For Kegelman auxiliary the fire/crash frequency will be used. A
        radio can be obtained from Kegelman fire department for communicating with the
        RCS.
        3.2.7.2.4. Vehicle operators must use LED/rotating beacon lights and/or emergency
        flashers when driving in the CMA.
        3.2.7.2.5. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent
        radio mounted in the vehicle to communicate with the ATCT. A hand-held radio
        should only be used as a backup or when communication is required outside the
        vehicle. Note: Conduct an operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
        3.2.7.2.6. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians operating on the CMA must use a
        distinct call sign (e.g., Airfield 1, Chief 1, Sweeper 1, TA 1, etc.) coordinated by the
        Wing ADPM to avoid duplicating, confusing, or different agencies using similar
        names (e.g. Airfield 1, Airfield Lighting, Airfield Sweeper, etc.). Note: Do not use a
        call sign that is also a part of ATC phraseology such as ―Taxi‖.
            3.2.7.2.6.1. Include vehicle and/or pedestrian call signs in the ADI.
            3.2.7.2.6.1. (VANCEAFB) Vehicle call signs approved for use are provided in

        authorizing vehicles to enter the runway for the purpose of an airfield
        inspection/check or other airfield operation. See FAA JO 7110.65, Air Traffic
        Control for additional information.
        3.2.7.2.8. Limit crossing the runway to vehicle operators/traffic performing mission
        essential duties and then only to an absolute minimum. Note: When crossing a
        runway is required during flying operations, the preferred crossing point is the
        departure end.
        3.2.7.2.8. (VANCEAFB) The perimeter road around the airfield is designated as the
        primary route for all traffic to gain access to areas west of the parking ramp. Runways
        will not be used as a convenient access to facilities to avoid performing tire FOD
        checks. Unless there is an operational need to cross a runway, drivers will use
        perimeter/access roads.
        3.2.7.2.9. Identify procedures for emergency removal or exit of vehicles and/or
        pedestrians in the event of vehicle/ATCT radio failure. At a minimum, procedures

           operators/pedestrians on the runway that there is a problem and/or emergency that
           requires them to immediately exit the runway.
           3.2.7.2.9.1. (VANCEAFB) Upon loss of radio communication, the Control
           Tower will cycle the runway light intensity up and down to indicate that
           personnel and vehicles must immediately exit the runway.
           3.2.7.2.9.2. All vehicle operators/pedestrians must exit the runway immediately.
           Contact ATCT or AM immediately and advise off the runway and include any
           pertinent information that might affect safe runway operations. If not able to
           communicate with ATCT or AM via radio, use other means of communication
           such as a cellular phone (when available). Report incident to AM immediately.
           3.2.7.2.9.2. (VANCEAFB) If loss of communication occurs, immediately exit
           the CMA and reattempt contact with the Control Tower. If unable, attempt radio
           contact with AMOPS, to confirm off the runway (CMA).
     3.2.7.3. Procedures and standards to use proper radio communications phraseology,
     discipline, and techniques. The words "clear" or ―clearance‖ must not be used in

     proper radio communication phraseology, discipline and techniques.
     3.2.7.4. Procedures and standards to use and maintain airfield driving visual aids/decals.
     At a minimum, all vehicles that operate on the airfield will contain the following
     AFVA/decals and diagrams: Note: Decals may be permanently affixed in plain view of
     the driver or clipped to the inside of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it
     can be flipped down for ready reference.
     3.2.7.4. (VANCEAFB) AFVA 11-240 and 13-222 and airfield diagram will be
     maintained in all vehicles that operate on the airfield. (Attachment 8, Figure 1 and
     Attachment 10, Figure 1 & 2).
        3.2.7.4.1. AFVA 11-240. Note: The FAA Form 5280-7, Airfield Visual Aid Safety
        Placard is the FAA equivalent to AFVA 11-240 and may be used by units located at
        shared-use airfields.
        3.2.7.4.2. AFVA 13-221 (optional if vehicle has an AFVA 11-240).
        3.2.7.4.3. AFVA 13-222.
        3.2.7.4.4. A current locally developed airfield diagram (provided by Wing ADPM).
        3.2.7.4.5. Hot Spots (as determined locally) when depicted on a different airfield
        diagram.
     3.2.7.5. Procedures and standards to comply with airfield signs, marking and ATCT light
     gun signals. Note: Provide a detailed description and an example of the following:
        3.2.7.5.1. Airfield signs (e.g., mandatory and informational).
        3.2.7.5.1. (VANCEAFB) Mandatory signs are placed at locations where an
        instruction must be followed, such as at each VFR hold line. These signs have white
        lettering on a red background. Formal signs have yellow lettering on a black
        background and are used to indicate a specific location. Directional signs have black
        lettering with a yellow background. These are used at intersections to indicate the
        way to a taxiway or location. Instrument Hold Signs (INST) are located at the
        instrument hold line. These signs have white lettering with red background. (See
        Attachment 10, Figure 3 & 8).
        3.2.7.5.2. Airfield markings (e.g. runway, taxiway, apron/ramp, instrument, etc.).
        3.2.7.5.2. (VANCEAFB) Taxiway markings and runway hold lines are six inches
        wide, painted reflective yellow. Runway markings are painted reflective white. (See
        Attachment 10, Figures 5, 9, 11, & 12).
            3.2.7.5.2.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Runway VFR hold lines are double solid and
            double broken yellow bars located 100 feet from the runway edge. The solid bars
            indicate a clearance is required to cross from that side. (See attachment 10.
            Figures 5).
            3.2.7.5.2.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Instrument hold lines are double yellow bars

            joined by yellow vertical bars labeled with ―INST‖ across the left side of the
            taxiway. This is to protect the instrument landing system (ILS) critical areas
            during inclement weather (ceiling is below 800 feet and visibility is less than 2
            miles). Areas protected are the Glide Slope Critical Area, Precision Obstacle Free
            Zone and Localizer Critical Area. When any of these areas are to be protected the
            control tower will turn the taxiway lights on to indicate clearance is required to
            cross the ―INST‖ hold lines. During nighttime hours airfield drivers will stop at
            ―INST‖ holdlines and call tower for clearance to cross the instrument hold lines.
            Clearance to cross the ―INST‖ hold line is not clearance to go onto the runway.
            The driver must stop at the runway hold sign and request clearance onto/across
            the runway. On perimeter road there are signs stating clearance is required to
            proceed beyond the sign when the taxiway lights are on. These areas are located
            on Taxiway A, E and F (east and west side of center runway). (See Attachment
            10, Figures 8 & 10).
        3.2.7.5.3. Airfield lighting (e.g. runway, taxiway, etc.).
        3.2.7.5.3. (VANCEAFB) All taxiways (except Taxiway Delta between the inside
        and center runways) and the parallel taxi lane have blue edge lights. The blue lights
        identify it is a taxiway during the hours of darkness and restricted visibility conditions
        during the day. Each light is located 10 feet from the edge of the pavement.
        Kegelman does not have airfield lighting. (See Attachment 10, Figure 14).
            3.2.7.5.3.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Runway edge lights are white and are
            located 10 feet from the edge of the pavement along both sides of the runway. At
            the end of each runway is a row of red in-pavement lights which indicate the end
            of the operational runway. The runway end lights consist of 10 red lights grouped
            in five on each side of the runway. On the opposite side of the runway end light
            fixtures are green lights which are spaced 10 feet apart and run across the width of
            the runway and extend 50 feet off the edge of the runway. These are threshold
            lights which identify the beginning of the operational runway. (See Attachment
            10, Figure 15).
     3.2.7.6. Procedures and standards to comply with vehicle speed limits on the airfield.
     Identify vehicle speed limits for the following:
     3.2.7.6. (VANCEAFB) Airfield speed limits for vehicle operation and towing of aircraft
     and equipment will be IAW AFI 91-203, chapter 24. Flight line road speed limit is 15
     MPH. Note: Emergency response vehicles or snow removal vehicles may exceed the

     immediate vicinity of an aircraft will be IAW AFMAN 24-306, Chapter 20 and AFI 91-
     203, chapter 24.
        3.2.7.7.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Vehicle operators will never drive between an
        aircraft and marshaller or drive under an aircraft shelter unless towing an aircraft.
        3.2.7.7.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Vehicles are not to be driven within 10 feet of a
        parked aircraft except when the aircraft is being serviced, loaded, or off-loaded.
        Vehicles will not be backed in the vicinity of parked aircraft unless a spotter is
        employed to direct the vehicle backing operation. At each parking location of
        assigned aircraft there is a single white line to identify 10 feet from the nose and tail
        of the aircraft. Note: Within the T-6 parking area the marking at the tail of the
        aircraft is a solid white line. This indicates the 10 feet from the aircraft and is not a
        vehicle lane.
     3.2.7.8. Procedures and standards for parking and chocking vehicles on the airfield.
     3.2.7.8. (VANCEAFB) Vehicle parking and chocking requirements will be IAW AFI
     91-203, chapter 24.
     3.2.7.9. Procedures and standards to comply with fixed and mobile obstacle distance
     requirements. Identify and define the minimum clearance requirements for fixed and
     mobile obstacles in relation to the runway, taxiway, taxilane, and aircraft-parking apron
     based on the most demanding aircraft using the facilities.
        3.2.7.9.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) The lateral clearance distance from a taxiway
        centerline to parked or moving vehicles is 200 feet. No vehicle will be parked or left
        unattended within 200 feet from a taxiway centerline.
        3.2.7.9.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) The lateral clearance distance from the parallel
        taxi lane edge to a mobile obstacle is 35 feet.
        3.2.7.9.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) The lateral clearance distance from the runway
        centerline is 1000 feet. When operating within this area do not park or leave a vehicle
        or equipment unattended within 925 feet from the edge of the runway.
28                                    AFI13-213_VANCEAFBSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012


        3.2.7.9.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) Mobile ground support equipment (ladder, chains,
        chocks, start cart, etc.) may be placed on the ramp no sooner than three hours before
        an aircraft arrival and must be removed no later than three hours after the aircraft
        departs. When such equipment is not in use it shall be removed and stored off the
        parking ramp. The designated parking area for AGE is located east of flight line road.
     3.2.7.10. Procedures and standards to comply with control tower light gun signals. Air
     traffic controllers use a light gun as a backup system for communicating with aircraft or
     ground vehicles if their radios stop working. When a vehicle operator experiences a
     radio failure on a runway or taxiway, they must vacate the runway as quickly and safely
     as possible and contact the ATCT or AM by other means, such as a cellular telephone to
     advise of the situation. If this is not practical, then the driver, after vacating the runway,
     should turn the vehicle toward the tower and start flashing the vehicle headlights and wait
     for the controller to signal with the light gun. All vehicle operators are required to know
     and comply with the following signals:
     3.2.7.10. (VANCEAFB) All vehicle operators that operate within the CMA will be
     trained on and comply with control tower light signals and will have AFVA 11-240
     affixed in their vehicle. Exception: Drivers with ―RAMP ONLY‖ stamped on their AF
     Form 483 are not required training on control tower light gun signals. Individuals with a
     ―RAMP ONLY‖ license are not authorized to operate a vehicle off the parking ramp,
     which extends to the western edge of the parallel taxi lane, or on any taxiway.
        3.2.7.10.1. Steady Green Light: ―Cleared to cross‖, ―Proceed‖, ―Go‖.
        3.2.7.10.2. Steady Red Light: ―STOP! Vehicle will not be moved‖.
        3.2.7.10.3. Flashing Red Light: ―Clear active taxiway/runway‖.
        3.2.7.10.4. Flashing White Light: ―Return to starting point‖.
        3.2.7.10.5. Red and Green Light: ―General warning. Exercise extreme caution.‖
        During alerts and emergency conditions all non-essential personnel will withdraw to
        AM or their work control center until the emergency is terminated. The withdrawal
        of contractors will be at the discretion of AM.
     3.2.7.11. Procedures and standards for Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention.
     Note: Vehicle operators must make every attempt to stay on paved surfaces and avoid
     driving on unimproved surfaces (e.g. dirt or grass). If driving on unimproved surfaces is
     required, conduct a FOD check upon exit of these areas or returning to paved surfaces.
     3.2.7.11. (VANCEAFB) FOD Prevention procedures will be IAW AFI 91-203, chapter
     24, and this instruction. All locations that require the driver to stop and conduct a FOD
     check of their vehicle are identified by a stop sign and a ―check tires‖ sign. The
     71FTW/CV waives the requirement to perform rollover checks (that part of the tire in
     contact with the pavement) during tire tread inspection except when entering from an
     unpaved surface, i.e., perimeter road. At these entrances the driver will inspect their tires,
     then roll forward and check that part of the tire that was in contact with ground.
        3.2.7.11.1. At a minimum, a FOD check will consist of the following:
AFI13-213_VANCEAFBSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                      29


        3.2.7.11.1. (VANCEAFB) If significant FOD or pavement that is cracked or broken
        is found, notify AMOPS via radio or telephone at (580) 213-7425/7426. AMOPS will
        inspect the area, and if necessary, will call for a sweeper.
            3.2.7.11.1.1. Inspection of vehicle tires (pull forward to check tire in contact with
            pavement). Remove foreign materials (e.g., rocks, gravel, etc.) as applicable.
            3.2.7.11.1.2. A visual check to ensure all external vehicle components are
            secured. Secure any/all items loaded on payload vehicle, including all tie down
            device loose ends such as chains, ropes, packaging or other item that may become
            dislodged during movement while on the airfield.
            3.2.7.11.1.3. A thorough walk around of the vehicle to check for damaged, loose,
            or worn parts.
        3.2.7.11.2. See AFI 21-101, Chapter 14 and AFMAN 24-306, Chapter 20 for
        additional information.
     3.2.7.12. Procedures and standards for using cellular/mobile phones on the airfield.
     Note: Cellular/mobile phones must not be used while driving on the airfield.
     3.2.7.12. (VANCEAFB) The use of personal electronic and communications devices is
     IAW AFI 21-101 AETCSUP 1, para. 1.13.1. Outside of those areas defined in AFI 21-
     101 AETCSUP 1 vehicle operators will not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely
     parked. While operating in the CMA cell phone use is prohibited.
     3.2.7.13. Procedures and standards for driving during restricted visibility or night
     operations. Poor weather conditions (e.g. snow, fog, rain, etc.) might obscure visual
     cues, roadway markings, and airfield signs. Vehicle operators must remain vigilant of
     their surroundings and operating boundaries. Watch out for snow removal equipment
     and aircraft operating in the vicinity under low-visibility conditions. There are additional
     risks present under these conditions. At a minimum, include procedures to stop and hold
     at an "INST" marking/sign when conditions are less than a reported ceiling of 800 feet or
     2 miles visibility.
     3.2.7.13. (VANCEAFB) The operation of vehicles during restricted visibility or during
     the hours of darkness will be IAW AFI 91-203, chapter 24. Headlights of a stopped
     vehicle shining towards a moving aircraft at night will be turned off immediately so the
     pilot’s night vision will not be affected. The vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers
     will be turned on so its position will be known. The headlights of the vehicle will remain
     off until the aircraft has passed then be turned on prior to putting the vehicle in motion.
     3.2.7.14. Procedures and standards for driving with daytime running lights.
     3.2.7.14. (VANCEAFB) Vehicles with daytime running lights that cannot be turned off
     will park in a safe location with ignition and headlights turned off, parking brake set, and
     emergency flashers on.
     3.2.7.15. Procedures and/or restrictions for operating motorcycles, mopeds/scooters,
     bicycles, tricycles, and other electrical, gas, or gasoline-powered golf-type carts or
     similar utility vehicles.
30                                    AFI13-213_VANCEAFBSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012


     3.2.7.15. (VANCEAFB) Personal vehicles of any type are not authorized on the airfield
     unless approved by the AFM. Bicycles, tricycles, ―golf carts‖ and/or ―mules‖ used in
     support of the flying mission do not require permits to be on the flight line. However,
     operators of these vehicles must have a valid airfield driver’s license. For night
     operations these vehicles must be equipped with an operational head and tail lights.
     Bicycles may have rear reflectors or reflector tape visible from the rear in lieu of tail
     lights.
     3.2.7.16. Procedures and/or operational restrictions for local units, as required.
     3.2.7.17. Procedures on use of perimeter, in-field or other airfield roads to reduce non-

     primary route for all vehicles to gain access to areas west of the parking ramp. Taxiways
     and runways will not be used as a convenient access to facilities to avoid performing tire
     FOD checks. Unless there is an operational need to cross a runway, drivers will use
     perimeter/access roads. If crossing a runway is required during flying operations, the
     preferred crossing point is the departure end. Drivers will notify AMOPS, via radio or
     telephone, when entering and exiting perimeter road.
        3.2.7.17.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Motorized vehicles require a temporary airfield
        permit or permanent POV decal to use perimeter road at any time.
     3.2.7.18. Procedures to conduct and document refresher training requirements on an
     annual basis. Wing ADPMs may require vehicle drivers to complete refresher training
     more frequently (e.g. twice a year) due to their limited or infrequent (e.g. once a week or
     month, emergency only, etc.) presence on the airfield. At a minimum, annual refresher
     training will include:
     3.2.7.18. (VANCEAFB) An airfield driver’s license is valid for one year. Renewal of an
     airfield driver’s license requires the license holder to complete refresher training NLT the
     last day of the month listed in the ―date refresher‖ block on the reverse of the AF Form
     483. Training will be conducted annually by the UADPM or alternate.
        3.2.7.18.1. A review of the ADI.

        instruction, completing the airfield driving CBT located on the Air Force
        Portal/ADLS and successfully completing a closed book test with at least 10
        questions, 5 of which must address runway incursion prevention. (minimum passing
        score 100%) NOTE: The CBT is not a substitute for the closed book test.
        3.2.7.18.2. Completion of the USAF Airfield Driving CBT, Airfield Driving.
        3.2.7.18.3. Runway incursion prevention test (at least 5 questions with a minimum
        passing score of 100%).
     3.2.7.19. Procedures to restrict runway crossing at locations known for
     communication/signal problems between ATCT and a vehicle operator/pedestrian as
     applicable. Also, include procedures to restrict runway crossing at ATCT visual blind
     spots as applicable.
AFI13-213_VANCEAFBSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                    31

     problems or visual blind spots.
     3.2.7.20. Procedures for emergency responses on or near the active runway(s). At a
     minimum, clearly define the primary (initial)/secondary (follow-on/support) response
     agencies and procedures to minimize unauthorized access on or across the runway.
     3.2.7.20. (VANCEAFB) Primary responders for in flight emergencies are the Fire
     Department, Wing Safety, Transient Alert and Airfield Management. One fire truck and
     Airfield Management will respond to the approach end of the landing runway. The
     remainder of the Fire Department, Wing Safety and Transient Alert vehicles will respond
     to the departure end of the landing runway. No driver will proceed onto the runway until
     specific clearance for that vehicle has been received from ATCT.
        3.2.7.20.1. Follow-on/support response agencies are required to standby in a
        designated area (e.g. ramp, taxiway, etc.) until called forward by the Fire Chief or
        incident/on-scene commander.
        3.2.7.20.1. (VANCEAFB) Secondary support is Security Forces and Medical.
        Security Forces will respond to the west side of the base operations building and wait.
        If requested, Medical will respond to the flightline and report to the Fire Chief. If
        needed at the aircraft the Fire Chief will call them forward. If a civilian ambulance
        responds it must be escorted onto the ramp, to the aircraft and then off the airfield.
        Request from the Fire Chief is NOT clearance to cross or go onto a runway.
        Clearance must be received from ATCT.
        3.2.7.20.2. All emergency response vehicles must have approval from the ATCT or
        authorized vehicle escort, to enter the CMA.
     3.2.7.21. Procedures for vehicle traffic control devices/lights located on active
     taxiways/runways (if applicable).

         3.2.11.4.1. The vehicle operator will ensure the disabled vehicle is not left
         unattended in the CMA.
         3.2.11.4.2. The disabled vehicle will be removed using any method in the quickest
         and safest way possible.
  3.2.12. Pedestrian Movement. Outline procedures for pedestrian movement on the airfield.
  At a minimum, pedestrians on the airfield must adhere to the following procedures:
AFI13-213_VANCEAFBSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                      39


  3.2.12. (VANCEAFB) Pedestrians without radio contact with the Control Tower or
  AMOPS are authorized only on the aircraft parking ramp. Pedestrians are not authorized on
  the airfield unless prior coordinated with Airfield Management.
     3.2.12.1. Pedestrians are authorized on the airfield for official business in support of the
     flying mission.
     3.2.12.2. Walk facing oncoming traffic.
     3.2.12.3. Do not sit or recline on the ramp in such a manner that interferes with normal
     ground vehicle and aircraft operations.
     3.2.12.4. Do not enter the CMA without two-way radio contact and approval from the
     ATCT.

  RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHRASEOLOGY, DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single, most
   important thought in communications with the ATCT is understanding. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the appropriate call sign.
   4.1.2. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator, must know exactly what the controller
   wants them to do.
   4.1.3. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
4.2. Radio Techniques.
   4.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing
   the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   4.2.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   4.2.3. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the ―microphone
   button‖, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure, the first word is transmitted clearly.
   Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   4.2.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
   scanning the runway to enable your request.
   4.2.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   ―stuck mike,‖ and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   4.2.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio blind
   spots.
   4.2.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at
   the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked.
4.3. Phraseology. Vehicle operators must contact the ATCT controller each and every time
they proceed onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must
advise the controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your
AFI13-213_VANCEAFBSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                       41


intentions are. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground
control and other persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must always
give aircraft and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists. VHF/UHF
transmissions are reserved for the primary use of aircraft and ATCT personnel.
   4.3.1. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

Table 4.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology.
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER
                                      AIRFIELD ONE.”
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, JACKSONVILLE
                                      TOWER.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER,
                                      AIRFIELD ONE REQUEST TO
                                      CROSS (runway) AT
                                      (point/intersection).
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, CROSS (runway)
                                      AT (point/intersection).
                                      or
                                      “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLD SHORT
                                      OF (runway).”
   4.3.2. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
   correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if you
   do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
   communications only occur when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.

Table 4.2. Sample Read back Instructions
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                      “AIRFIELD ONE UNDERSTANDS
                                       APPROVED TO CROSS (runway)

proceeds across the runway             or
                                       “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLDING
                                       SHORT (at location).”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                      “JACKSONVILLE TOWER,
                                       AIRFIELD ONE CROSSING
                                       COMPLETE, OFF (runway) AT
                                       (location).”
ATCT:                                  ―AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER.”

   4.3.3. If vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they are required to provide a
   read back to the ATCT.

Table 4.3. Sample Hold Short Instructions.
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD THREE PROCEED

or for you to hold at the Runway Hold line/VFR hold line prior to receiving approval into the
CMA.
Host Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately—Used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent
situation.
Instrument Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in
retro-reflective yellow paint.
Light Gun—A handheld directional light signaling device which emits a brilliant narrow beam
of white, green, or red light as selected by the tower controller. The color and type of light
transmitted can be used to approve or disapprove anticipated pilot actions where radio
communication is not available. The light gun is used for controlling traffic operating in the
vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.

Perimeter Road—A road around the runway perimeter designed to connect the access roads.
Precision Obstacle Free Zone—An 800 foot wide by 200 foot long area centered on the runway
centerline adjacent to the threshold designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from
ground vehicles and other aircraft when ceiling is less than 250 feet or visibility is less than 3/4
statute mile (or runway visual range below 4,000 feet.)
Privately Owned Vehicle (POVs)—A vehicle that is owned or leased by a private party.
