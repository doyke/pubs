                                AIRFIELD INFORMATION

1.1. Airfield Information.

    1.1.1. Columbus AFB has three parallel runways. The inside runway (13R/31L) is the
    primary runway for T-6 operations. The outside runway (13L/31R) is the primary runway
    for T-38C pattern operations and is also used by T-1s. The center runway (13C/31C) is the
    primary instrument runway and is normally used by T-1s and T-38s for initial takeoff. An
    airfield diagram is located in Attachment 2.

    NOTE: T-38C aircraft below divert fuel can land on the inside runway with 14 OG/CC
    approval. Horizontal additional markings on the inside runway indicate the leading edge of
    the surface suitable for T-38 emergency landings (Surface available from start of landing
    zone to end of roll out is: Rwy 31L - 8429’/Rwy 13R - 7555’). The inside runway is not
    suitable for T-38C night landings due to the placement of the visual approach path indicator
    Runway Point of Interception.

       1.1.1.1. Rwy 13/31C: 12,004’ long, 300’ wide. 3,500’ concrete each end, remaining
       length asphalt.

       1.1.1.2. Rwy 13L/31R: 8,001’ long, 150’ wide. 1,000’ concrete each end, remaining
       length asphalt.

       1.1.1.3. Rwy 13R/31L: 6,315’ long, 175’ wide. Concrete / asphalt.

       1.1.1.4. Overruns on each runway extend from the end of runway as follows:

              1.1.1.4.1. RWY 13R: 1000’, full strength pavement.

              1.1.1.4.2. Rwy 13C: 1000’.

              1.1.1.4.3. Rwy 13L: 1000’.

              1.1.1.4.4. RWY 31L: 1635’, full strength pavement.

              1.1.1.4.5. Rwy 31C: 1000’.

              1.1.1.4.6. RWY 31R: 1000’.

    1.1.2. Columbus AFB has 14 Taxiways: A, A1, B, C, E, F, F1, G, H, J, K, L, M, and M1.
    All taxiways are 75 feet wide, except for Taxiway B, which is 50 feet wide. Taxiways A1,
    H, F, E, G, and K have 50-foot shoulders on each side. 14 FTW assigned aircraft use
    Ramps B and D; transient aircraft use Ramp C.
     1.1.3. Visual Blind Areas. There are no visual blind areas from the ATC tower. However,
     aircraft located under the aircraft shelters may not be visible from the ATC tower. Aircraft
     taxi at their own risk in this area.

     1.1.4. Radio Blind Areas. There are no continuous radio blind areas; however, Taxiway L
     for aircraft on 379.925 (ATC tower) and 275.8 (Ground Control) and D ramp for 269.55
     (clearance delivery) are problematic.

1.2. Command and Control. The Airfield Manager (AFM) has the authority to close/suspend
and resume airfield, runway or taxiway operations. The ATC tower Watch Supervisor
(WS)/Senior Controller (SC) has the authority to suspend runway/taxiway operations in the
interest of safety. The Supervisor of Flying (SOF) may delay a runway closure/suspension in the
interest of flight safety.

     1.2.1. Airfield Management (AM) Operations (AMOPS) will respond to all in-
     flight/ground emergencies unless waived by the SOF. “SOF calls” will be documented on
     AF IMT 3616. When the SOF or ATC tower WS/SC requests a foreign object damage
     (FOD) or runway surface condition (RSC) check, AM will respond as soon as possible.
     ATC tower/RSUs should prioritize access to the runway to allow completion of the
     requested check. Requested checks will take priority over normal student touch-and-go
     training.

     1.2.2. The SOF is the direct representative of the 14 OG/CC and is the focal point for
     command and control of flying operations. The SOF normally operates in the ATC tower
     during local wing flying. SOF duties are explained in AFI 11-418, Operations Supervision
     and CAFB Supplement.

1.3. Control of Ground Traffic in the Controlled Movement Area (CMA): CMA includes
runways, overruns, and all areas within 100' of a runway (Attachment 2). Controlled movement
areas require two-way radio communication with the ATC Tower (ATCT) and approval prior to
CMA entry. Taxiways A1 and F shall require access approval IAW paragraph 3.2.2 to ensure
the ILS Protection areas are not infringed upon. Ultra high frequency (UHF) equipped vehicles
may contact the controlling agency for clearance on to a runway (i.e. Live Oak RSU, Sunfish
RSU, Ground Control, etc.). All other vehicles (except fire department) will contact Ground
Control (ramp net) for clearance onto any runway. The fire department contacts Ground Control
on the crash net. Once authorized on a runway, vehicles or personnel will maintain direct two-
way radio communication with the controlling agency and will inform them upon exiting the
CMA.

     1.3.1. CMA Radio Failure. ATCT will turn on the runway edge lights and
     increase/decrease the intensity of the runway/taxiway lights as an emergency notification to
     exit the runway/CMA. Ground traffic and personnel will reposition via the most direct
     route and remain 100’ outside of the CMA until two-way radio communications is
     reestablished.
     1.3.2. When direct two-way radio communication is not possible with the ATCT, radio
     equipped escorts in communication with tower are required. ATCT will alternatively use
     light gun signals to direct the movement of traffic in the CMA (Table 1.1).

Table 1.1. Ground Light Gun Signals.

Steady Green                 Cleared to cross runway or taxiway
Steady Red                   STOP
Flashing Red                 Clear the runway or taxiway
Flashing White               Return to your starting point
Alternating Red / Green      Exercise extreme caution

1.4. Airfield Lighting Systems. When the ATC tower is closed, control of the runway/taxiway
lights is delegated to Airfield Lighting. Airfield Lighting will operate the airfield lighting system
from the lighting vault and conduct airfield lighting checks. CAFB lighting systems consist of
the following:

     1.4.1. Runway 13L/31R: High-intensity Runway Edge Lights (HIRL), Runway Distance
     Remaining Markers, Threshold Lights, Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPIs).

     1.4.2. Runway 13R/31L: Medium-intensity Runway Edge Lights (MIRL), Runway
     Distance Remaining Markers, Threshold Lights, PAPIs.

     1.4.3. Runway 13C/31C: HIRL, Sequenced Flashing Lights (SFL), Runway Distance
     Remaining Markers, Threshold Lights, PAPIs, Approach Lighting System (ALSF-1).

     1.4.4. Taxiways: Taxiway Edge Lights.

     1.4.5. Rotating Beacon. Will be operated IAW FAAO JO 7210.3 and JO 7110.65.

1.5. Permanently Closed Areas on Airfield. The unnamed taxiway between the midpoint of
Taxiway A and runway 13R/31L is permanently closed and unusable.

1.6. Aircraft Arresting System (AAS) Configuration and Procedures. Columbus AFB has
two MA-1A aircraft arresting systems authorized for use by T-38C aircraft and two BAK-15
systems authorized for use by all base T-38C and T-1 aircraft. T-6 aircraft will not use either
arresting system. Runway 13L BAK-15 barrier is located 120 feet into the overrun. Runway 31R
BAK-15 barrier is located 119 feet into the overrun. BAK-15 barriers are approximately 14-1/2
feet in the center and rises to 23-1/2 feet near the outside posts. Runway 13C MA-1A barrier is
located 101 feet into the overrun. Runway 31C MA-1A is located 103 feet into the overrun. MA-
1A’s are approximately 4 feet high.

     1.6.1. The ATC tower is responsible for ensuring the barriers are operational and in proper
     configuration. Standard configuration for the MA-1A is in the up position at the departure
     end of the runway and down at the approach end. Standard configuration for the BAK-15
     is in the down position at both ends of the runway. Tower and RAPCON issue appropriate
     advisories to all aircraft when barriers are in a nonstandard configuration and will not
     advise 14 FTW aircraft when the configuration is standard.

     1.6.2. ATC Tower will notify Airfield Manager before releasing arresting systems to
     barrier maintenance for maintenance or configuration changes. All barriers are
     inspected/maintained IAW AFI 32-1043/CAFBS1 and 14 OSS/14 CES Arresting Systems
     Ops Letter. If a problem with the barrier is identified, the inspection team will exit the
     runway and notify ATC tower with the nature of the problem. The ATC tower will inform
     the SOF and coordinate with Liveoak (if necessary) on the impact of the problem on further
     operations. If the problem cannot be resolved and impacts operations, the SOF will notify
     the 14 OG/CC, Airfield Manager and each squadron’s duty desk. The Airfield Manager
     shall issue a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) declaring the barrier out of service as required.

          1.6.2.1. Aircraft Arresting Systems status will be reported as unserviceable or
          serviceable.

     1.6.3. The Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC) must be notified at least 48
     hours prior to the test of a barrier IAW AFI 13-204v3.

     1.6.4. Landings (including touch-and-go) are NOT permitted over a raised approach-end
     barrier. Low approaches over a raised approach-end barrier are restricted to at or above
     500’ AGL.

     NOTE: Aircraft Arresting System Emergency Procedures are located in Chapter 8 of this
     document.

1.7. Parking Plan/Restrictions.

     1.7.1. Taxiways A, J, and C ramp has a limited load-bearing capability. If a requirement
     exists to park heavier aircraft, coordinate with 14 OSS/OSAB, 14 OG/CC and 14 FTW/MX
     to use Taxiway E. This area has a load capability of over 450,000 pounds.

     1.7.2. For emergency evacuation, aircraft will be parked IAW the CAFB parking plan.

     1.7.3. The SAC Alert area may also be used for parking large aircraft.

     1.7.4. Weights may be increased by 80% for limited emergency use.

     1.7.5. Airfield facilities include seven hangars for fighter-type aircraft only, with a total
     capacity of 181,839 sq ft. An additional hangar is used for miscellaneous storage with
     44,080 sq ft available.

     1.7.6. Aircraft parking plan is on file in AM.

     1.7.7. All 50 ft shoulders are not marked with deceptive shoulders markings.
     1.7.8. Use caution at the intersections of Taxiways J/C and C/G. Apron edge is less than
     25 feet in the turn.

     1.7.9. Towing movements are conducted IAW the appropriate maintenance TO’s for
     aircraft being towed in the hangar/maintenance aprons.

1.8. Air Traffic Control (ATC) Facilities.

     1.8.1. Columbus Air Force Base provides both RAPCON and ATC tower services to
     aircraft. During normal T-6 student training the inside runway is controlled by a Runway
     Supervisory Unit (RSU), call sign "Sunfish”. During normal T-38C SUPT student training,
     the outside runway is controlled by an RSU, call sign "Live Oak”.

     1.8.2. Airfield Operating Hours. Normal airfield and ATC tower hours of operation are
     1200-1700L Sunday, 0700-1900L Monday-Friday, and closed Saturdays. RAPCON hours
     of operation are 1000-1700L Sunday, 0700-1900L Monday-Friday, and closed on
     Saturdays. These hours may vary according to the base flying schedule. ATC and Airfield
     Management Operations (AMOPS) facilities are closed on all federal holidays. All
     facilities will extend hours of operation to support 14 FTW flying as manning permits.
     Operating hours may be extended by Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) to accommodate local
     flying operations after coordination through the AOF/CC and 14 OG/CC.

          1.8.2.1. Standby and on-call procedures. The OG/CC may authorize the use of
          standby and on-call procedures for AO facilities.

                1.8.2.1.1. Standby: “During published flying hours” AO personnel will be
                immediately available to return the facility to operations within 1 hour after
                notification. Consider standby time as “duty time”.

                1.8.2.1.2. On-Call: “Outside of normal operating hours” AO personnel must
                remain within the local area, be able to be contacted and return the facility to
                operations within 3 hours after notification. Personnel who are on-call must not
                consume alcohol or take medications that affect duty status. Do not consider
                on-call time as “duty time”.

                1.8.2.1.3. Notification and equipment checks: The AOF/CC or designated
                representative will notify the normally scheduled crew for Standby duties. The
                On-Call crew will be designated based upon available manning and crew-rest
                requirements. All notifications will be accomplished via recall roster.
                Equipment checks will be accomplished in accordance with established facility
                opening checklists.

     1.8.3. After Hours Landing/Departure. The 14 OG/CC is the approving authority for
     all (base and transient) aircraft landing/departures times outside normal airfield hours.
     AMOPS is the primary coordination facility for after hours landings/departures (alternate,
     14 FTW Command Post).
     1.8.3.1. AMOPS will:

          1.8.3.1.1. Upon request for after hours landing/departures, ask requester if
          he/she is aware that Columbus AFB will be/is closed. Advise requester of
          current airfield operating hours. If times cannot be changed, the following
          information will be gathered: reason published hours cannot be complied with,
          reason for visit, times of arrival/departure, type of aircraft, services required,
          distinguished visitor status, names and titles, as applicable. AMOPS shall
          process NOTAMS when operating hours deviate from published hours and will
          coordinate changes with the following agencies at a minimum: ATC
          tower/RAPCON, Command Post and Security Forces.

          1.8.3.1.2. After the AMOPS specialist has all the information, they will notify
          the AFM for instructions prior to proceeding. After normal business hours,
          these individuals may be reached via cell phone.

          1.8.3.1.3. Notify transient maintenance of the possibility of an after-hours
          transient landing/departure. Confirm they can support the transient aircraft.

          1.8.3.1.4. Relay request with all available information received above, to
          approving authority and relay approval/disapproval to requester.

          1.8.3.1.5. During normal duty hours, contact the Airfield Operations Flight
          Commander (AOF/CC) to obtain approval.

          1.8.3.1.6. If unable to contact the AOF/CC, coordinate with 14 OSS/DO for 14
          OG/CC approval.

          1.8.3.1.7. After receiving approval, notify the AFM, AOF/CC or 14 OSS/DO,
          RAPCON, ATC tower, Fire department, Transient maintenance or maintenance
          job control (whichever is appropriate), Base Weather station and Command
          Post.

          NOTE: IAW AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs,
          aircraft flight operations when the tower or Airfield Management is closed
          requires MAJCOM/A3 approval.

          1.8.3.1.8. Normally, all facilities (RAPCON, Tower, and AMOPS) will be
          open and operational 30 minutes prior to an arrival or departure, based on
          proposed times. Facility openings will be accomplished IAW facility opening
          checklists.

          1.8.3.1.9. 14 FTW Command Post will coordinate landing/departures outside
          the daily wing flying window.

1.8.4. Local frequencies. See Attachment 3 for ATC frequencies.
     1.8.5. The Digital Airport Surveillance Radar has been identified by the OSS Commander
     as a part of the National Airspace System.

1.9. ATCALS Navigational Aids (NAVAIDs). The following are published in DoD flight
information publications (FLIP) as the no-NOTAM preventive maintenance schedule (NOTE:
all times are local).

     1.9.1. Caledonia VORTAC (identifier CBM). Sunday, 0800-1000 local; Monday – Friday,
     2200-0530 local.

     1.9.2. Instrument landing system (ILS). Sunday, 0700-0900 local; Monday – Friday,
     2200-0530 local.

     1.9.3. Columbus AFB digital airport surveillance radar (DASR). Saturday – Sunday,
     0700-0900 local; Monday – Friday, 2200-0530 local.

     1.9.4. The RAPCON is designated as the NAVAID monitoring facility for CAFB. The
     RAPCON will monitor the Remote Status Indicators (RSI) for each NAVAID and inform
     other facilities of outages IAW applicable Watch Supervisor checklists.

Table 1.2. Local NAVAID frequencies.

1.10. Auxiliary Power Requirements.

     1.10.1. All NAVAIDs have generator capability that automatically activates when
     commercial power is unavailable. These automatic transfer generators are tested on a
     monthly basis to ensure proper functioning.

     1.10.2. ATC tower/RAPCON requirements:

          1.10.2.1. The 14 OG/CC has exempted the ATC tower/RAPCON from going to
          auxiliary power 30 minutes prior to the arrival of thunderstorms/severe weather.

          1.10.2.2. The auto-start capability is considered reliable enough to warrant
          exemption.
           1.10.2.3. The generator has an integral monitoring system connected to the command
           center at the Civil Engineering Squadron (CES). This allows CES to track the
           generator when it starts and stops, during operation and when it fails to start.

           1.10.2.4. If the generator fails to start, ATC facility personnel shall manually start the
           generator. CES will dispatch personnel to check the generator and manually start it if
           necessary.

           1.10.2.5. When the emergency generator is operating, the operating statistics will be
           checked and annotated every hour by CES on the form provided in the generator
           room.

1.11. Transient Alert. Transient Alert hours of operation are 1200-1700L Sunday, 0700-1900L
Monday-Friday, closed Saturdays and on all federal holidays. Services provided during open
hours include: Low pressure and high pressure oxygen (OX), liquid oxygen (LOX), Oil (0-148,
0-156, A/M32A-86 and A/M 32A-95) and Fuel (JP-8 and JP-8+100). SOAPs are provided
Monday-Friday only.

1.12. Special Operations Areas/Ramps. An airfield diagram is located in Attachment 2.

     1.12.1. The SAC Alert area is designated as an all-purpose special operations area/ramp
     for emergencies, exercises and activities. All requests for use of the SAC area must be
     routed through AMOPS.

     1.12.2. Hot Brake Areas are located at the north and south Hammerheads and Taxiway J.

     1.12.3. The designated hijacked aircraft location is the SAC ramp. This location should be
     used during known or suspected hijack situations. Unauthorized landing aircraft should
     also be placed in this area until otherwise directed by the on-scene commander.

1.13. Noise Abatement. There are no published noise abatement procedures for Columbus
AFB. ATC facilities and AMOPS shall refer noise complaints to base Public Affairs and record
information in daily events log. AOF/CC will advise 14 OSS/OSOP of the incident.

1.14. Quiet/Restricted Noise Periods. Time periods for quiet/restricted noise must be
approved by the OG/CC. The event POC shall draft an electronic staff summary sheet (eSSS)
and submit to scheduling (14 OSS/OSOS). Scheduling will forward the eSSS for OG/CC
approval via the 14 OSS/DO. Once approved by the OG/CC, the eSSS shall be returned to
scheduling for dissemination to applicable organizations (flying squadron programmers and
DOs, airfield operations (14 OSS/OSA), SOF program manager, maintenance, etc.). Quiet
periods may be authorized for events in maintenance hangars, while a restricted noise period is
typically authorized for an event at the Memorial Plaza. AMOPS shall publish applicable
NOTAMS as required.

     1.14.1. Quiet Period. The intent of a quiet period is no aircraft/AGE flightline noise. No
     takeoffs, engine starts, patterns or low approaches are permitted. Flightline use of AGE is
     prohibited. Only landings due to fuel state or emergency will be approved and these will
     be accomplished via a straight-in approach to the center runway (any T-6 experiencing an
     engine malfunction is allowed an ELP). Aircraft will hold after exiting the runway until
     SOF advises Ground Control that aircraft may taxi.

     1.14.2. Restricted Noise Period. The intent is to minimize noise outside the flightline.
     Normal engine runs, taxi and vehicle operations on the ramp are authorized. All takeoffs
     are prohibited except for T-1 and T-6 initial takeoffs on the center runway and/or the
     outside runway. All aircraft will plan on one landing to a full stop from a straight-in
     approach. In case of unusual circumstances, such as weather or in-flight emergencies
     (IFEs), aircrew may deviate from these restrictions.

1.15. Restricted/Classified Areas on the Airfield.

     1.15.1. There are no restricted/classified areas on the airfield.

1.16. Civilian Use of NAVAIDS. When local flying is not in progress, RAPCON may permit
civil aircraft to use CAFB NAVAIDs for practice low approaches to CAFB.
NOTE: RAPCON will approve approaches (military or civilian aircraft) at CAFB only if the
ATC tower and airfield are open.

1.17. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures. Weather reporting procedures
are found in CAFBI 15-101, Weather Support to Columbus AFB.

AIRFIELD GROUND OPERATIONS

2.1 Aircraft Ground Operations.

    2.1.1. Taxi Procedures.

            2.1.1.1. Engine Start. All Columbus based aircraft will monitor Ground Control (CH
            1) prior to or immediately following engine start. Obtain ATIS prior to taxiing.

            2.1.1.2. Aircraft will advise Ground Control (CH 1) of the ATIS code when calling
            for taxi. Aircrew will read back the assigned runway, all hold short instructions, or
            Sunfish procedures (outlined in 2.1.2.).

            NOTE: Aircraft located under the aircraft shelters may not be visible from the ATC
            tower. All aircraft taxi at their own risk when in this area.

            2.1.1.3. Aircraft taxiing out have priority over aircraft returning to the parking area.

            2.1.1.4. All aircraft will contact Ground Control (CH 1) for further taxi instructions
            after landing on and clearing runway 31L and 13C. T-6 aircraft landing on runway
            13R will monitor Ground Control to parking. All aircraft exiting the outside runway
            will hold short of runway 31C/13C and contact Tower (CH 3) for clearance to cross
            the center runway. Flight lead shall ensure all flight members are on frequency and
            are ready to cross before contacting Tower. When runway 31 is in use and Sunfish
            Procedures are not in effect, all aircraft exiting runway 31C at Taxiway A1 or that
            have crossed runway 31C at Taxiway M1, will be directed by tower to hold short of
            runway 31L and contact Ground Control (CH 1) for further taxi instructions. The
            normal runway exiting point for all aircraft landing on runway 31C is the end of the
            runway, unless otherwise requested by aircrew or directed by ATC. The preferred
            runway exiting point for all aircraft landing on runway 13C is Taxiway H if able.

            2.1.1.5. T-6 aircraft entering Taxiways J and L shall enter the designated run-up
            spots IAW AFI 11-2T-6v3 CAFB Sup 1.

            2.1.1.6. Standard Taxi Routes: Aircraft will utilize the most expeditious route to its
            assigned take-off runway unless otherwise instructed by ATC. Air Traffic Control
            will provide the required taxi route IAW JO 7110.65.

            2.1.1.7. To ensure proper wingtip clearance dual Taxiways/lanes C, D, and G will be
            restricted to single-lane taxi for all aircraft when a transient aircraft is involved. All
            remaining taxiways are single-lane use only.

    2.1.2. Sunfish Procedures.
2.1.2.1. Sunfish Procedures are instructions issued by Ground Control/Local Control
that inform the aircraft commander that they are required to hold short of runway
13R/31L, until instructions have been issued by the Sunfish RSU crew to cross
runway 13R/31L using the following guidelines.

2.1.2.2. When the Sunfish RSU crew controls runway 13R, Ground Control will
advise aircraft taxiing out to runway 13C/13L by specifying “SUNFISH
PROCEDURES.” Runway 13R Sunfish Procedures are: Aircrew will taxi to runway
13C/13L via Taxiway A and hold short of runway 13R VFR hold short line on
Taxiway A. Upon passing Taxiway L, aircrew will switch to the Sunfish RSU
frequency (CH 2) to monitor radio transmissions. The use of traffic lights located on
the opposite side of the runway will be utilized to indicate when crossing may be
accomplished. This will reduce radio transmissions between the aircrew and the RSU
crew. A red light will indicate to the aircrew that they are required to hold short of
runway 13R. The green light will indicate to the aircrew that the Sunfish RSU has
given the aircrew permission to taxi across runway 13R. The aircrew will then
visually clear final before crossing the active runway. Aircrew will not normally
check-in on Sunfish frequency.

NOTE: Ground Control will issue instructions as follows: “(Callsign), Columbus
Ground, Runway 13 Center, taxi Sunfish Procedures”. Aircraft shall read back
Sunfish procedures indicating they understand the hold short procedure. If “Sunfish
Procedures” is not read back by the aircraft, GC will state “Read back Sunfish
Procedures” to ensure receipt of runway hold short instructions.

2.1.2.3. When the Sunfish RSU crew controls runway 31L, Local Control will advise
aircraft exiting/crossing the departure end of runway 31C by specifying “SUNFISH
PROCEDURES.” Runway 31L Sunfish Procedures are: Aircrew will hold short of
runway 31L VFR hold short line on Taxiway A1. When clear of 31C, crew will then
switch to Sunfish RSU frequency (CH 2), and await clearance from the Sunfish RSU
crew to cross runway 31L. If the aircraft have not been cleared to cross by the RSU
controller after 5 minutes, the lead aircraft will query the controller with “(NUMBER
OF AIRCRAFT), (TYPE OF AIRCRAFT), HOLDING SHORT.” Aircrew will
refrain from using the term “CROSS” in their transmissions to Sunfish. The
controller will acknowledge this radio transmission and, when appropriate, clear the
aircraft to cross with “(NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT), (TYPE OF AIRCRAFT),
CROSS RUNWAY 31L.” Once clear of runway 31L aircraft will taxi to park via
Taxiway A and check in with Ground Control Frequency upon passing Taxiway L.

NOTE: Local Control will issue instructions as follows: “(Callsign), (Turn Left at the
End), (Cross Runway 31 Center), Sunfish Procedures.” Aircraft shall read back
Sunfish procedures indicating they understand the hold short procedure. If “Sunfish
Procedures” is not read back by the aircraft, LC will state “Read back Sunfish
Procedures” to ensure receipt of runway hold short instructions.
    2.1.3. Heavy aircraft operations. Due to pavement and jet thrust avoidance
    considerations, all heavy aircraft will taxi on the center runway to the SAC Alert Ramp
    unless previously coordinated with Airfield Management.

         2.1.3.1. Heavy Aircraft Jet Thrust Avoidance Procedures. Taxiing aircraft will
         maintain a safe distance from heavy aircraft and ATC may use the words jet blast,
         propwash, or rotorwash, in lieu of wake turbulence, when issuing a caution advisory
         to taxiing aircraft. Because wake turbulence is unpredictable, the controller is not
         responsible for anticipating its existence or effect.

    2.1.4. Engine Run-up/Test Procedures. All personnel conducting installed engine runs will
    notify the ATC tower when initiating an engine run and will monitor Ground Control
    frequency for the duration of the test. The standard T-6 Power Management Unit (PMU)
    run-up check in the designated areas on Taxiway J and L do not require this notification.

         2.1.4.1. T-1 engine run area. Aircraft parking ramp and maintenance apron adjacent
         to the parking ramp at the designated/painted spot. To conduct take-off thrust engine
         runs, T1s must have at least 200’ behind the aircraft clear of all obstacles.

         2.1.4.2. T-6 engine run area. Aircraft parking ramp, hangar quad angle and T-6 trim
         pads at the south end of the airfield.

         2.1.4.3. T-38C engine run area. Aircraft parking ramp and T-38 hush houses at the
         south end of the airfield.

         2.1.4.4. Off-station aircraft. Any off-station aircraft requiring an engine run must
         coordinate with the Airfield Manager and the ATC tower. The designated take-off
         thrust engine run area for off-station aircraft is either hammerhead (Taxiway A1 or
         F). Ensure at least 50 ft of useable concrete is behind the tail of the aircraft and at
         least 300 ft behind the tail of the aircraft is clear of all obstacles to ensure proper
         safety distances.

2.2 Vehicle Ground Operations.

    2.2.1. Aircraft Towing Procedures.

         2.2.1.1. Vehicles will not pass under any part of an aircraft unless necessary for
         towing, loading, fueling, defueling or as required by applicable technical orders.

         2.2.1.2. Maximum vehicle speeds while towing are as follows:

               2.2.1.2.1. 15 mph maximum for normal vehicle operations on flightline road
               and/or when towing a single power unit unless the equipment T.O. mandates a
               lower towing speed (i.e., MD-3 etc.).
           2.2.1.2.2. 15 mph maximum for towing one maintenance stand or multiple
           power units.

           2.2.1.2.3. 5 mph maximum for towing aircraft.

           2.2.1.2.4. 5 mph maximum for towing two or more stands.

2.2.2. Vehicle/Pedestrian Operations on the Flightline. For information regarding the
flightline subjects listed below, refer to CAFBI 13-213, Airfield Driving.

     2.2.2.1. Flightline Airfield Management Operations responsibilities.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL

3.1. Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS) Procedures. CAFB ATIS is
broadcast 24 hours on VHF 115.2 and UHF 273.5. In addition to information that is required
IAW JO 7110.65, the following information (at a minimum) is included in the ATIS broadcast
when the tower is operational:

     3.1.1. The ceiling and visibility will be included if the ceiling is at or below 5,000 feet
     and/or visibility is at or below 5 miles. When ceiling and visibility are greater than 5,000
     feet and 5 miles, they may be omitted.

     3.1.2. The temperature and dew point will only be given in Celsius.

     3.1.3. Only NOTAMS affecting local operations that have taken effect after wing flying
     commenced for the day are included in the ATIS broadcast.

     3.1.4. Include bird condition if it is other than “Low”.

     3.1.5. Alternate fuels are included in ATIS if they differ from the standard fuel
     requirements in the individual aircraft’s In-Flight Guide (IFG). When alternate fuels differ
     from the IFG due to icing or other factors, the SOF will direct ATC personnel to include
     alternate fuels in the ATIS message.

     3.1.6. FPCON will be included only when the current level affects flying operations. The
     SOF will determine when a change in FPCON status will be included in the ATIS
     broadcast.

     3.1.7. Stating which runways the ATC tower controls will indicate the operational status of
     the RSUs.

     3.1.8. Notification that alternate NAVAID procedures are in effect will be included for
     unannounced NAVAID outages. Long-term NAVAID outages (> 72 hours) are not
     included.

     3.1.9. Glider Operations taking place at George M. Bryan Airport (STF) and Monroe
     County Airport (M40).

     3.1.10. Airfield advisories that potentially affect all aircraft are included in the ATIS.

     3.1.11. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) - Include in the ATIS broadcast remarks that
     "remotely piloted aircraft operations are in progress.” This advisory is required once a RPA
     requests to taxi or launch, and 15 minutes prior to its estimated time of arrival, if operating
     outside of the terminal airspace. Terminate advisory when RPA operations are complete;
     RPA is not returning for over one hour, or when the RPA lands, exits the runway, and no
     longer poses a potential impact to taxi operations.

     3.1.12. When the Tower is non-operational the following information will be included in
     the ATIS as a minimum: “COLUMBUS TOWER HAS SUSPENDED OPERATIONS.
     FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONTACT MEMPHIS CENTER ON 307.0 OR
     127.1”.

3.2. Protection of the ILS Critical Areas and Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ).

     3.2.1. ILS Critical Areas will be protected IAW AFI 13-204v3 and are depicted in
     Attachment 2.

          3.2.1.1. Any time runway edge lights are in use, vehicles are required to hold short of
          all instrument hold lines and contact tower for further instructions. When the
          reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or visibility is less than 2 miles, the ATC
          tower will not authorize aircraft larger than fighter type size to operate in or over the
          ILS critical areas when an aircraft conducting an ILS approach is inside the final
          approach fix (FAF). When the reported ceiling is less than 200 feet and/or visibility
          is less than ½ mile (RVR 2,400) the ATC tower will not authorize aircraft/vehicle
          operations in or over the ILS critical areas when an aircraft conducting an ILS
          approach is inside the FAF.

          3.2.2. The POFZ will be protected IAW JO 7110.65. When an aircraft on a
          vertically-guided final approach is within 2 miles of the runway threshold and the
          reported ceiling is below 300 feet or visibility is less than 3/4 SM ground control will:
          instruct ALL aircraft taxiing to or vehicles approaching Rwy 31C to hold short of the
          instrument hold line on Taxiway F. Instruct all aircraft taxiing to or vehicles
          approaching Rwy 13C to hold short of Rwy 13R or Taxiway M instrument hold line
          if approaching from the SAC ramp. All other routes will hold short of the VFR
          holdlines.

3.3. Runway Change Procedures.

     3.3.1. Effective Runway Change Time. Attempt to plan runway changes a minimum of 60
     minutes in advance. The effective runway change time is the time the center runway
     resumes full-stop landings in the new direction. Inside and outside runway operations are
     suspended at this time and will resume when the barrier is in place and the controlling
     agency is ready to operate.

     NOTE: During Restricted Overhead/VFR Straight-in status, all aircraft will depart the
     pattern or full stop 10 minutes prior to initiation of the runway change.

     3.3.2. The SOF coordinates all runway changes when local flying is in progress. The SOF
     will inform the OG/CC, Squadron SUPs/Top 3, RSUs, RAPCON, and ATC tower of the
     runway change. The SOF will ensure all appropriate agencies notify 14 FTW aircraft in
     radio contact.

     3.3.3. ATC agencies will comply with Runway Change Time Schedule to the maximum
     extent possible. The ATC tower will notify AMOPS and Weather Flight of the runway
     change time.

     3.3.4. If either Sunfish or Live Oak must complete the runway change with one RSU crew,
     the ATC tower will assume control of the affected runway on the ATC tower’s frequency
     once the new pattern has been established. The ATC tower will inform RAPCON to advise
     all aircraft canceling IFR for entry to either the Sunfish or Live Oak pattern to contact the
     ATC tower. The ATC tower will maintain control until the crew has relocated to the new
     RSU and assumes control of the runway. The ATC tower will advise the SOF of any solo
     aircraft that enter the pattern(s) while they have control.

     3.3.5. AMOPS will notify the fire department and barrier crew of the Runway Change
     Time. AMOPS will also ensure the fire department and power production personnel are in
     place to change barriers 15 minutes prior to runway change time.

     3.3.6. Runway Change Time Schedules. The ATC tower/RSU may deviate from these
     times with SOF approval if appropriate for emergencies or traffic conditions. All agencies
     listed above will be informed of the new adjusted time.

 3.4. Local Flying Area/Designation of Airspace.

      3.4.1. CAFB RAPCON Airspace. RAPCON airspace spans approximately 50 nautical
      miles around Columbus AFB from the surface up to and including FL 230. Columbus
      airspace includes two T-6 MOAs--west and southeast of CAFB. The floor of each MOA is
      8,000' MSL with the tops at FL220. There is one T-38C/T-1 MOA north of the airfield.
      The floor of the T-38C MOA is 8,000' MSL up to and including FL220. ATC Assigned
      Airspace (ATCAA) spans from FL180 to FL220 (FL230 for Meridian 1 East MOA). There
      is a major victor airway (V278) that runs east/west directly through Columbus airspace
      from west to east approximately 15 nautical miles south of the airfield. V245 joins V278
      from the southwest at the Bigbee VORTAC and splits to the southeast at the MINIM
      intersection. Jet Route 52 (J52), which mirrors V278, is a feeder route for numerous
      civilian aircraft into Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. CAFB RAPCON
      airspace is depicted in Attachment 12.
    3.4.2. CAFB Class C Airspace. CAFB Class C airspace includes an outer area, which is a
    non-regulatory area, 20NM radius of CBM, surface to 17,500' MSL. The airspace includes
    a regulatory area 5NM radius of CBM, surface to 4,200' MSL and from 5NM to 10NM,
    1,500' MSL – 4,200' MSL. CAFB Class C airspace is depicted in Attachment 4.

    3.4.3. ATC tower Airspace. RAPCON delegates to the ATC tower the airspace within
    designated RSU airspace from the surface to 3,500’ MSL. Additionally, ATC Tower
    delegates airspace to Sunfish (3.5.1.1) and Live Oak (3.5.1.2.) upon request.

3.5. VFR Local Training Areas.

    3.5.1. Sunfish airspace extends from the surface to 3,500' MSL along the 7 DME arc to the
    south of runway 13R/31L, but excludes airspace past 3NM beyond the departure end. The
    T-6 VFR pattern altitudes are as follows:

    OVERHEAD: 1,200' MSL
    BREAKOUT OVERHEAD: 2,200' MSL
    STRAIGHT-IN: 700' MSL
    LOW KEY/ELP: 1,700’ MSL
    HIGH KEY/ELP: 3,200’ MSL
    STRAIGHT-IN BREAKOUT: 700' MSL
    HIGH PATTERN: 3,200' MSL

    3.5.2. Live Oak airspace extends from the surface to 3,500' MSL along the 10 DME arc to
    the north of runway 13L/31R, excluding airspace past 3NM beyond the departure end. The
    T-38C VFR pattern altitudes are as follows:

    OVERHEAD: 1,700' MSL
    OVERHEAD BREAKOUT: 2,500' MSL
    STRAIGHT-IN: 1,200' MSL
    STRAIGHT-IN BREAKOUT: 1,200' MSL
    LOW CLOSED: 800' MSL
    LOW CLOSED BREAKOUT: 1,200' MSL
    HIGH PATTERN: 3,000' MSL

    3.5.3. T-1 VFR pattern altitudes are as follows:

    RECTANGULAR: 1,700' MSL
    TACTICAL: 1,700' MSL
    STRAIGHT-IN: 1,200' MSL
    STRAIGHT-IN BREAKOUT: 1,200' MSL
    PATTERN BREAKOUT: 2,500' MSL
    LOW CLOSED: 800' MSL
    LOW CLOSED BREAKOUT: 1,200' MSL
     3.5.4. RAPCON and ATC tower will ensure all transients (arrivals or departures) are
     aware of the practice areas.

3.6. Sunfish and Live Oak RSU Practice Area Protection. When Sunfish RSU or Live Oak
RSU have control of their respective runway/practice area, RAPCON will not vector aircraft
below 4,000’ MSL within the immediate lateral dimensions of their practice area. RAPCON will
ensure separation is provided between RSU traffic and aircraft transitioning the Columbus Class
"C" airspace.

3.7. VFR Weather Minimums. VFR weather for USAF aircraft consists of a ceiling of 1,500
feet and visibility of 3 statute miles or greater. IFR weather for USAF aircraft is less than a
1,500 foot ceiling and/or visibility less than 3 statute miles.

NOTE: For ATC and Weather services, VFR is defined as a ceiling of 1,000 feet and visibility of
3 statute miles or greater IAW JO 7110.65.

3.8. Special Procedures.

     3.8.1. Helicopter Arrivals.

           3.8.1.1. The ATC tower will advise Sunfish RSU when an arriving helicopter departs
           the CBM 240/011 DME fix (helicopter VFR entry point). Sunfish RSU will
           discontinue straight-in operations.

           3.8.1.2. The ATC tower will advise Sunfish RSU when the helicopter is at the 4NM
           orbit point (CBM 240/004). Do not clear the helicopter to land or depart the orbit
           point until Sunfish RSU advises there are no T-6 aircraft maneuvering to the 2NM
           point.

           3.8.1.3. When the T-6 status is Restricted Overhead, the ATC tower will advise
           RAPCON to stop radar entries when the helicopter reaches the CBM 240/011 DME
           fix. The ATC tower will advise RAPCON when radar entries may be resumed.

           3.8.1.4. The ATC tower will advise Sunfish RSU when the arriving helicopter is over
           the ramp and straight-in approaches may be resumed.

     3.8.2. Helicopter Departures.

           3.8.2.1. The ATC tower will advise Sunfish RSU when a helicopter is waiting to
           depart. The ATC tower will not clear the helicopter to depart until Sunfish RSU
           advises radar entries have been stopped, and there are no aircraft between the
           termination point and 2NM. Advise Sunfish RSU when the departing helicopter
           passes the CBM 240/004 outbound so straight-in operations may be resumed.

           3.8.2.2. When the T-6 status is Restricted Overhead, the ATC tower will advise
           RAPCON to stop radar entries. The ATC tower will not clear the helicopter to depart
          until Sunfish RSU advises there are no T-6 aircraft between the termination point and
          2NM. Advise RAPCON and Sunfish RSU when the helicopter departs the CBM
          240/004 outbound so radar and straight-in entries may be resumed.

     3.8.3. Flight Check Procedures. FAA flight inspection aircraft operating in the vicinity of
     Columbus AFB with flight profiles that will impact wing flying shall be handled IAW JO
     7110.65 and ATC tower/RAPCON checklists. The SOF may reduce or terminate local
     flying IAW applicable SOF quick reaction checklist. Flight Check aircraft will typically
     fly VFR while conducting their checks.

     3.8.4. Heavy Aircraft Arrival/Departure Notification Procedures.

          3.8.4.1. The ATC tower shall:

                3.8.4.1.1. Notify Sunfish and Live Oak RSUs when an arriving heavy aircraft is
                5NM.

                3.8.4.1.2. Notify Sunfish and Live Oak RSUs when a heavy aircraft starts
                engines.

                3.8.4.1.3. Notify Sunfish RSU when a heavy aircraft requests taxi from the alert
                area.

          3.8.4.2. RAPCON shall notify Sunfish or Live Oak RSUs when an arriving heavy
          aircraft is 25NM out.

     3.8.5. Functional Check Flight Procedures. Aircraft performing checks of aircraft/aircraft
     equipment are designated by the call sign "FLAT" and do not receive any special handling
     unless requested.

3.9. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). ATC tower will provide RSRS IAW AFI
13-204v3 AETC Sup 1, and RSU’s will provide RSRS IAW AFI 11-202V3 and AETCI 11-204.
Required separation distance is measured from the threshold to the nearest aircraft on the
runway.

     3.9.1. Wet Runway Reduced Same Runway Separation. Reduced same runway separation
     is authorized at Columbus AFB on all runways during wet runway operations.

          3.9.1.1. Wet Runway RSRS Operations for Similar Trainer-Type Aircraft which is
          defined as T-38 - T38 or T-6 –T-6 (NOTE: Similar Trainer-type maybe only be
          applied to T-6 and T-38 operations when using alternate runway side procedures).
          The RSRS for similar trainer-type aircraft is:

                3.9.1.1.1. 3,000 feet minimum separation is required or preceding aircraft is
                airborne for all AETC T-38’s and T-6’s when:
                3.9.1.1.2. Full Stop (FS): behind FS, Low Approach (LA) or Touch and Go
                (TG).

                3.9.1.1.3. LA: behind LA or FS.

                3.9.1.1.4. TG: behind TG or LA.

                3.9.1.1.5. Single ship FS or LA behind a preceding formation flight if both
                formation aircraft are positioned on the cold (exit) side of the runway.

          3.9.1.2. 6,000 feet minimum separation is required or preceding aircraft is airborne:

                3.9.1.2.1. Anytime a T-1 is involved.

                3.9.1.2.2. LA behind TG.

                3.9.1.2.3. TG behind FS.

                3.9.1.2.4. Anytime alternate runway side procedures are not or cannot be
                employed.

                3.9.1.2.5. Formation flight (holding hands) FS behind a preceding single ship or
                formation flight.

          3.9.1.3. Wet Runway RSRS Operations for Dissimilar Trainer-Type Aircraft, which
          is defined as T-38 to T-6, T-38 to T-1 etc..The RSRS for dissimilar trainer-type
          aircraft is 6,000 feet minimum in all cases.

3.10. Intersection Departures. Aircraft may utilize intersection takeoffs if
coordinated/approved through Ground Control. Controllers will state the number of feet
remaining on the runway for the departing aircraft to utilize.

3.11. Wind Limitations on ATC tower. When wind velocity reaches sustained 78 knots, the
ATC tower personnel will complete the appropriate evacuation checklist and relocate to the
RAPCON. If rapid approaching weather condition does not permit evacuation of the ATC tower
to the RAPCON, locate to one of the lower floors and away from windows until wind subsides.

3.12. Wind Limitations on the Digital Airport Surveillance Radar (DASR). RAPCON will
normally coordinate with radar maintenance to shut off the DASR antenna anytime the wind or
wind gusts reaches or exceeds 85 knots. Radar maintenance will place the antenna in free-wheel
mode to prevent damage to the equipment. If possible, notify Tupelo tower before shutting off
the radar. Airborne traffic is the primary consideration when opting to shut off the DASR
antenna.

3.13. Unscheduled/Unauthorized Aircraft Arrivals. Any aircraft that conducts approaches or
lands at Columbus AFB without approval is considered an unauthorized aircraft.
NOTE: If the aircrew declares an emergency, they may land at Columbus AFB without a PPR
from AMOPS.

     3.13.1. In the event that an aircraft conducts unauthorized approaches at Columbus AFB:

          3.13.1.1. ATC tower shall notify RAPCON of unauthorized aircraft and shall
          discontinue departures. Tower WS, in conjunction with the SOF, will deem if it is
          necessary to break aircraft out of the RSU pattern.

          3.13.1.2. RAPCON shall cease all inbounds and prepare for RSU aircraft breaking
          out of the VFR pattern. RAPCON shall also prepare to divert aircraft if needed.

          3.13.1.3. Both facilities shall attempt to gather data on the aircraft to include: call
          sign, type, color, tail number and route through Class C airspace. RAPCON shall
          track the aircraft for as long as possible (coordinate with other agencies if necessary).
          WS shall notify the AOF/CC. Data on the incident (DATS, Daily Events Log, etc.)
          will be safeguarded.

          3.13.1.4. AM shall notify Security Forces and ensure the aircrew reports to AMOPS
          to fill out a DD 2402 (Hold Harmless Agreement) and a DD 1131 (Cash Collection
          Voucher) for collection of landing fees.

          3.13.1.5. AM will notify 14OG/CC and brief him the details of the incident. The
          WG/CC makes the final decision whether the landing is inadvertent or intentional.

     3.13.2. If the aircraft lands at Columbus AFB, implement CAFB Plan 31-101, Integrated
     Defense Plan, Annex L, Appendix 12.

3.14. Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft. Implement CAFB Plan 31-101, Integrated Defense Plan,
Annex L, Appendix 12.

3.15. Local Aircraft Priorities. The ATC tower controllers will provide traffic priority IAW
JO 7110.65. If necessary, the ATC tower WS/SC may coordinate with the SOF for temporary
amendment to local priorities.

     3.15.1. DV aircraft have priority over all other aircraft with the exception of those listed in
     JO 7110.65.

     3.15.2. Transient arrivals and departures will be given priority over local aircraft.
     Normally, transient aircraft are not authorized multiple approaches during local flying
     operations.

     3.15.3. Functional Check Flight aircraft have priority over local training sorties.
     3.15.4. Departing aircraft have priority over arriving aircraft at the discretion of the ATC
     tower WS/SC. To ensure the expeditious flow of traffic and prevent delays in the
     hammerhead, priority may be given to departing aircraft by directing arriving aircraft to
     make a restricted low approach or having RAPCON send aircraft to initial. Priority should
     not be given to departing aircraft if the arriving aircraft is a delay mission, check-ride, or
     full-stop landing.

3.16. Standard/Local Climb Out. In order to protect the 360 degree overhead pattern when the
weather is VFR (3.7), the standard instrument climb out procedure for runway 13C/31C is, “FLY
RUNWAY HEADING. CROSS DEPARTURE END AT OR BELOW 700’. CLIMB AND
MAINTAIN 4000’. CONTACT DEPARTURE CHANNEL 16.” When the weather is less than
VFR (3.7), "FLY RUNWAY HEADING ,CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 4,000’. CONTACT
DEPARTURE CHANNEL 16." RAPCON may abbreviate climb out instructions for local
aircraft by stating, “AFTER COMPLETING LOW APPROACH/TOUCH AND GO/OPTION,
EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT”.


3.17. Opposite Direction Traffic Procedures.

     3.17.1. Opposite direction operations are not authorized when SUPT flying is in progress,
     with the following exceptions:

          3.17.1.1. Emergency aircraft (only when opposite direction operation is specifically
          required).

          3.17.1.2. Flight check.

          3.17.1.3. Special missions.

     3.17.2. In the event one of the exceptions above requires an opposite direction approach
     while SUPT is in progress, or an opposite direction operation is requested when SUPT
     flying is not in progress, the following cutoffs shall apply:

          3.17.2.1. Arrival vs. Arrival. When an opposite direction arrival reaches 15 miles on
          final, arrivals to the active runway will not be allowed to proceed closer than 15 miles
          on final. VFR aircraft in the pattern will be restricted from turning base leg until the
          aircraft has landed or executed missed approach.

          3.17.2.2. Arrival vs. Departure. Opposite direction departure must be airborne and
          turned 45 degrees off the inbound radial of the final approach course or climbed
          through the altitude of the arrival before the normal arrival reaches 15 miles on final.

          3.17.2.3. Departure vs. Arrival. When opposite direction arrival reaches 15 miles on
          final, all normal procedures will be terminated.
           NOTE: If opposite direction arrival intends to circle to land on the active runway,
           normal departures can be resumed after the opposite direction arrival has begun its
           circling maneuver into the downwind and visual separation is applied by the ATC
           tower. If ATC tower cannot apply visual separation, the opposite direction must full
           stop before normal departures can be resumed.

     3.17.3. Opposite direction operations may be approved to any runway if Tower has control
     of all three runways, and the provisions of JO 7110.65 shall be complied with.

     3.17.4. Landing over a raised barrier is prohibited for AETC aircraft except during an
     emergency situation. If opposite direction approach is required for an AETC aircraft the
     web barrier must be lowered prior to the aircraft reaching the Final Approach Fix (FAF) on
     an instrument approach, being established on final for a visual straight-in or reaching 3 -to -
     5 mile initial.

           3.17.4.1. Opposite direction arrivals are NOT authorized for tail hook-equipped
           aircraft over a raised barrier/cable. Tail hook-equipped aircraft will conduct only
           restricted low-approaches over raised barrier/cable except in an emergency situation.

3.18. Breakout/Go-Around Procedures. (Instrument Approach)

     3.18.1. In order to protect the 360 degree overhead pattern, unless ATC specifies
     otherwise, breakout from an IFR approach/go-around procedures shall be as follows:

           3.18.1.1. Inside final approach fix, follow instructions in paragraph 3.16.

           3.18.1.2. Outside final approach fix but within 10 miles on final, "FLY RUNWAY
           HEADING, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 4,000”.

     3.18.2. RAPCON shall read back go-around instructions verbatim to ATC tower. This
     may be accomplished by simultaneously transmitting the go-around instructions to the
     aircraft and the ATC tower.

     3.18.3. Anytime an aircraft is given a breakout inside of 10-mile final, ATC tower shall
     automatically stop departures until informed by RAPCON that the breakout aircraft is no
     longer a factor.

     3.18.4. VFR Pattern Breakouts to Radar. See paragraph 6.3.5. and 7.3.12.

3.19. Civilian Aircraft Operations. The following procedures will be used for civilian air
traffic that could potentially impact Sunfish or Live Oak operations.

     3.19.1. RAPCON will:

           3.19.1.1. On initial contact, advise the civilian aircraft to remain outside of Class C
           airspace for coordination.
          3.19.1.2. Coordinate the operation with the affected RSU.

          3.19.1.3. After receiving RSU approval, allow the aircraft to enter the practice area.
          In the case of aircraft checking the pipeline, advise the RSU the aircraft will proceed
          to the Columbus AFB South Gate, before executing a turn outbound away from the
          base.

          3.19.1.4. Issue a traffic advisory to the civilian aircraft along with the approval to
          proceed into Class C airspace. As a minimum, the traffic advisory will include that
          numerous training aircraft are operating in the immediate vicinity of Columbus AFB.

          3.19.1.5. Advise ATC tower of the operation after authorizing the aircraft to proceed.
          If transfer of communications to ATC tower will occur, advise ATC tower when and
          where transfer will take place.

     3.19.2. The ATC tower will:

          3.19.2.1. Repeat the traffic advisory if the aircraft contacts the ATC tower.

          3.19.2.2. Provide traffic advisories on observed conflicts if in visual contact with the
          civilian aircraft. If transfer of communication has not been made, the traffic advisory
          will be given to RAPCON.

          3.19.3. The impacted RSU will:

                3.19.3.1. If aircraft within the RSU practice area are on a straight-in approach,
                request RAPCON hold the civilian aircraft outside of the RSU practice area.

                3.19.3.2. (Sunfish RSU only) If the status is restricted overhead when receiving
                notification of the civilian operation, advise RAPCON to stop radar entries.

                3.19.3.3. (Sunfish RSU only) If the status is dual or better, do not clear aircraft
                to the 5-mile point.

                3.19.3.4. Return to normal operations after RAPCON or the ATC tower reports
                the civilian aircraft has exited the RSU practice area.

          3.19.4. The ATC facility in communication with the civilian aircraft when it departs
          RSU airspace will call the appropriate RSU, and the other ATC facility, to advise that
          the aircraft is clear of RSU airspace.

3.20. SOF Operating from ATC tower. The SOF is the direct representative of the 14 OG/CC
and is the focal point for command and control of flying operations. The SOF normally operates
in the ATC tower anytime local wing flying is active.
3.21. Non-Radar Operating Procedures. When the CAFB airport surveillance radar is out of
service, aircrews will follow normal operating procedures with exceptions listed in this
paragraph.

     3.21.1. Radar failure is a catastrophic limitation for ATC. All initial radar failure
     procedures are accomplished to prevent a collision between aircraft operations in the
     system and to organize and expedite the flow of traffic. Additionally these procedures
     enable the later transition to either long-term non-radar procedures or the return to normal
     radar operations.

                 3.21.1.2.    Initial Radar Failure.

     3.21.2.1. Crews established in Columbus RAPCON controlled MOA’s can expect to cease
     maneuvering and standby for ATC instructions.

     3.21.2.2. RAPCON will transmit, “Attention all aircraft, Columbus radar out of service,
     radar contact lost. Standby for further instructions.”

     3.21.2.3. RSUs and ATC tower will stop all departures. SOF and RSUs should direct full
     stops as pattern saturation dictates.

     3.21.2.4. SOF will initiate Area Hold procedures and direct single ship solo students to
     cancel IFR and remain in their assigned areas until directed by RAPCON to recover. These
     instructions shall be relayed through ATC controllers. Area Hold procedures direct aircraft
     to cease maneuvering, climb to the top of their assigned altitude block, and hold at
     maximum endurance airspeed. Additionally, the aircraft shall contact the squadron SUP
     for their primary divert base, and also relay their fuel status and intentions.

     3.21.2.5. Should VFR conditions permit, SOF may direct all assigned aircraft established
     in Columbus controlled MOAs to cancel IFR, remain in their assigned areas, and standby
     for RAPCON directed VFR recoveries. Fuel permitting, aircrew should not execute
     recovery without RAPCON concurrence to avoid Sunfish/Live Oak saturation.

     NOTE: All aircraft must descend to 17,500’ MSL or below prior to canceling IFR.

     3.21.2.6. In the event conditions do not permit VFR recoveries, aircrew can expect to be
     placed in IFR holding patterns by RAPCON for IFR recovery sequencing via non-radar
     ATC procedures.

     3.21.2.7. For IFR recoveries, aircraft established in the Columbus MOAs can expect to be
     placed in holding at:

     NOTE: These are expected holding locations and may be used/not used based upon
     current air traffic control requirements.
     3.21.2.8. South Approach Control (T-6 Southern MOA): JUNUK, CBM R-156/23
     (Attachment 23)

     3.21.2.9. West Approach Control (T-6 Western MOA): HUDSI, CBM R-290/23
     (Attachment 23)

     3.21.2.10. North Approach Control (T-38 Northern MOA): WOLOV, CBM R-
     033/23

3.21.3. Long-Term Radar Outage Procedures (expected to exceed 2 hours following Initial
Radar Failure).

NOTE: The outage need not be expected to last longer than 2 hours to implement long-
term procedures. SOF in coordination with RAPCON will determine when a transition is
made.

     3.21.3.1. VFR – Unlimited launches per hour are authorized.

     NOTE: In the event of a radar outage, CAFB owns SFC-7000'. Any Columbus 1 /
     Meridian 1 East MOA operations will be contingent upon Memphis Center Approval.

          3.21.3.1.1. Local MOA sorties will be flown VFR. Aircrews will use self-
          reporting procedures on the appropriate local frequencies. RAPCON will
          provide traffic advisory assistance when workload allows. All T-6 recoveries
          will be to the Sunfish pattern. T-38C and T-1s will recover to the center or
          outside runways.

          3.21.3.1.2. Local Instrument canned departures will be flown VFR until an IFR
          pickup can be obtained from an adjacent controlling agency. Cancel IFR upon
          contact with RAPCON during recovery.

          3.21.3.1.3. VFR to IFR pickup – WS/SCs will restrict the number of launches
          to 10 aircraft per hour to prevent saturation of Memphis ARTCC. Aircrew who
          desire a planned VFR departure with an IFR pickup will file a DD-175. Local
          canned profile flight plans suffice for this requirement.

     3.21.3.2. IFR – RAPCON can provide Non-Radar IFR service to a combined total of
     approximately 10 aircraft per hour. Memphis Air Route Traffic Control Center
     (ARTCC) assumes control of all Columbus RAPCON airspace FL180 and above in
     the CBM 1 MOA/ATCAA and MEI 1 East MOA/ATCAA, and above 7,000’ MSL
     elsewhere. Arrivals will cancel IFR as soon as practical to allow RAPCON to
     expedite departure/recovery traffic. T-6 aircraft will not fly the Tupelo, Tuscaloosa
     or CATRN canned profiles during radar outages.
                 3.21.3.2.1. RAPCON will provide a release for each IFR departure and non-
                 radar approach control service. They will provide climb out instructions for IFR
                 departures and advise aircrew of MOA availability.

                 3.21.3.2.2. Practice instrument approaches are not authorized unless
                 coordinated with the SOF and RAPCON.

     3.21.4. MOA Procedures. Operations in the CBM 1 MOA and the MEI 1 East MOA use
     VFR. Vertical operating limits of these areas are 8,000’ to 17,500’ MSL. Aircrew are
     solely responsible for maintaining area boundaries. Merging traffic and traffic advisories
     are not available. Aircrew using the CBM 2 MOA/ATCAA, CBM 3 MOA/ATCAA, and
     CBM 4 MOA/ATCAA will depart VFR and request an IFR pickup with Memphis Center.
     Aircrew using other MOAs or VR low-level routes will fly VFR en route and contact the
     appropriate agencies prior to entry.

3.22. Wing Flying Definition. For ATC manning purposes, wing flying is defined as
simultaneous operations by two or more base-assigned airframes totaling 10 or more aircraft
conducting local training (i.e., utilizing MOAs, multiple approaches/patterns).

3.23. Golden Triangle Regional Airport (GTR) Instrument Approaches.

     3.23.1. Aircrew will minimize requests for opposite direction approaches at GTR.

     3.23.2 Due to airspace complexity and limitations, T-38’s will not normally fly practice
     approaches at GTR. GTR airport can be used as an alternate airport due to weather or
     runway limitations at CBM.

3.24. Runway/Status Selection Procedures. Runway 31 is designated the calm wind runway
when winds are less than 5 knots. The SOF determines the landing runway, flying status and
restrictions appropriate for the weather and status of facilities. The SUPs/Top 3 may further
restrict their flying status and must coordinate the status with the SOF. Pilot Reports (PIREPs)
will be given if an aircrew believes the status could be improved or degraded due to weather.
PIREPs will be reported to the SOF or the RSU Controller if in the pattern. If local training is
not in progress, the ATC tower Watch Supervisor/Senior Controller determines the landing
runway.

     3.24.1. The SOF must use sound ORM for weather conditions throughout the day when
     selecting a runway. Selecting a runway upon opening for visibility issues should be
     coordinated with other factors (i.e. winds) throughout the day in order to minimize runway
     changes during the flying day.

3.25. Military Operations Area (MOA) Procedures. This section contains general MOA
procedures applicable to all airframes. Airframe-specific information is located in sections 5.14.
(T-6), 6.15. (T-38C), and 7.14. (T-1).

     3.25.1. General MOA information:
           3.25.1.1. All wing assigned aircraft will proceed to and from MOAs under IFR to the
           maximum extent possible.

           3.25.1.2. Altimeter Settings. All 14 FTW aircraft will set the local altimeter setting
           once established in the MOA/ATCAA. Aircrew will limit their operation in the
           CBM1 and MEI1E MOA, using the following table. Aircrew will adhere to vertical
           limitations given by any Center upon entering their controlled MOAs.

Table 3.3. Altimeter Settings.

Local Altimeter      CBM 1,3,4,       CBM 2
Setting              MEI1E
29.92 or higher      22,000’          21,000’
29.91 to 28.92       21,000’          20,000’
28.91 to 27.92       20,000’          19,000’

     3.25.2. Columbus RAPCON Controlled MOA/ATCAA.

           3.25.2.1. Columbus RAPCON MOA discrete frequencies. UHF frequencies are
           listed in Attachment 3. MOA discrete frequencies will NOT be continuously
           monitored by Columbus RAPCON. The RAPCON will still provide work calls and
           acknowledge initial communication checks on the discrete frequency.

                  3.25.2.1.1. Aircraft will maintain a listening watch on the discrete MOA UHF
                  frequency and 243.0. Aircraft will request recovery from the Columbus
                  RAPCON controlled MOAs on the following UHF frequencies: 317.5 (T-6
                  CBM1 MOA), 263.15 (T-6 MEI1E MOA), 239.25 (T-1/T-38 CBM1 MOA).

           3.25.2.2. Formation aircraft may use transponder mode 3 code of “0000” in the CBM
           RAPCON controlled MOAs to facilitate safety. One aircraft will continuously use
           the ATC assigned mode 3 code.

           3.25.2.3. Area assignment. RAPCON makes area assignment for T-6 MOAs. T-38C
           and T-1 sector assignments will be established by the appropriate squadron prior to
           takeoff. RAPCON should assign the predetermined sector to these aircraft.

           3.25.2.4. RAPCON will:

                  3.25.2.4.1. Provide IFR separation between MOA participants and other non-
                  participating IFR traffic.

                  3.25.2.4.2. Apply merging target procedures between participating 14 FTW
                  aircraft. Merging target procedures are defined as a form of radar separation
                  that ensures targets do not “touch.”
                3.25.2.4.3. Issue instructions necessary to help keep aircraft in an area or to
                separate them from other traffic, even if the aircraft is maintaining the proper
                area boundaries and provide assistance with area orientation by using “(CALL
                SIGN), WORK (DIRECTION)” control techniques.

                3.25.2.4.4. Provide traffic advisories on known or observed VFR traffic
                transitioning through the airspace.

                NOTE: 14 FTW aircraft are MARSA IAW para 3.26. CBM RAPCON will
                assist aircraft as necessary.

     3.25.3. Memphis Center Controlled MOA/ATCAA.

           3.25.3.1. Area Assignment. Aircraft operating in CBM 2, 3, 4 MOA/ATCAA will
           request sector assignment from Memphis Center.

           3.25.3.2. For procedural deconfliction, the T-1 squadron schedules the two southern
           most sectors of CBM 3 MOA/ATCAA. The T-38 squadrons schedule the rest of the
           sectors of CBM3 MOA/ATCAA. Aircrew desiring to use sectors their squadron does
           not schedule must deconflict with the appropriate squadron.

           3.25.3.3. Memphis Center may instruct flights to change direction and/or compress
           their altitude block within the MOA (not sectors) to separate nonparticipating aircraft.
           Aircrew shall abort the maneuver in progress and instantly comply with their
           instructions. Instructions may be given in abbreviated phraseology. Example: "(Call
           sign), WORK SOUTH."

3.26. Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for the Separation of Aircraft (MARSA)
Operations. MARSA is defined as a condition whereby the military services involved assume
responsibility for separation between participating military aircraft in the Air Traffic Control
system (DoD FLIP, General Planning). MARSA operations will be conducted IAW AFI 13-201
AETC Sup 1 and AETC/A3 Approval Letter. Operations include:

     3.26.1. 14 FTW aircraft participating in CBM1 or MEI1E MOA/ATCAA are MARSA with
     other 14 FTW aircraft participating in the same MOA/ATCAA. Participation begins when
     aircraft cross the boundaries of the MOA/ATCAA, to include all departure and recovery
     corridors established in the confines of that MOA/ATCAA.

     3.26.2. 49 FTS aircraft are MARSA with aircraft participating in Dissimilar Aircraft
     Combat Training (DACT), in the CBM1-4 MOA/ATCAAs, MEI1E MOA/ATCAA, and
     the BHM MOA/ATCAA. DACT will be coordinated IAW AETCI 11-207. DACT
     missions shall be coordinated with the ATC controlling agency NLT 24 hrs prior.

     NOTE: Non-DACT 14 FTW aircraft, within CBM1 MOA/ATCAA, are MARSA with DACT
     aircraft to allow the use of separately defined sectors and corridors within CBM1
     MOA/ATCAA.
3.26.3. 14 FTW aircraft on circling approaches to RWYs 31L/13R and 31R/13L are
MARSA with 14 FTW aircraft arriving and departing RWY 31C/13C.

     3.26.3.1. Circling beyond the centerline of the designated circling runway is not
     authorized unless otherwise approved by ATC.

     3.26.3.2. When a non-participating aircraft is on an approach, MARSA procedures
     will be suspended.

3.26.4. Simultaneous departures from parallel runways are MARSA IAW AETC/A3
approved MARSA letter.
Chapter 4

AIRFIELD MANAGEMENT

4.1. Airfield Maintenance.

     4.1.1. Sweeper Operations. The majority of sweeper operations will be conducted at night
     after the termination of flying operations. The schedule provides for daily coverage of high
     traffic areas and weekly coverage of other areas. In the event inclement weather prohibits
     coverage of a particular area, the missed area is assigned to the remaining work week and
     the work hours expanded.

            4.1.1.1. To ensure that the entire airfield is covered at least once a week, sweeper
            operations will be as follows:

            MONDAY: Center runway. Access roads to RSUs #1-6 and Taxiways M1 & F1.
            TUESDAY: Center runway. Columbus AFB Auxiliary Field.
            WEDNESDAY: Outside runway, Taxiways M1 and F1.
            THURSDAY: Inside runway, north Hammerhead, Taxiways A1, K, E and the access
            roads to all 6 RSUs.
            FRIDAY: Taxiways A, M, L, abandoned taxiway adjacent to Taxiway A and the
            SAC Area.
            DAILY: In addition to the above, the main parking apron, all flightline access roads,
            transient ramp, south Hammerhead, Taxiways A, J, H, F, E, C, G, D and the trim pad
            are covered daily.

            4.1.1.2. During flying operations, a sweeper is assigned to vacuum the petroleum, oil
            and lubricants (POL) parking area, the area in front of the Bldg 262 and the area
            between the dock hangars. The vehicle traffic lane on the ramp shall be vacuumed
            three times a day at approximately 0800, 1200 and 1600 hours. This is to include
            both lanes of traffic from in front of airfield management operations to the southeast
            end of the main ramp.

            4.1.1.3. Sweeper operators should be trained on how to identify and eliminate
            hazardous FOD on the airfield. They should also be instructed in driving on the
            airfield during active flying conditions.

            4.1.1.4. Sweepers operated in the movement area must have radio contact with the
            ATC tower. The sweeper will advise AMOPS once operations are complete on the
            airfield.

            4.1.1.5. The Columbus AFB auxiliary airfield (Gunshy) located at Shuqualak, MS,
            will be swept and vacuumed each Tuesday. Civil Engineering personnel will
            coordinate an alternate day with the Airfield Manager if sweeping operations cannot
            be conducted on Tuesday. Sweeper operations may be increased due to airfield
           construction projects or decreased due to flying schedule as directed by the Airfield
           Manager.

           4.1.1.6. AMOPS shall monitor sweeper operations to prevent and control FOD.
           Aircrew shall contact ATC tower/SOF to relay any FOD problems. AMOPS shall
           divert sweepers as necessary to areas of immediate attention and shall ensure airfield
           or ramp sweeper requests by telephone are relayed via the ramp net radio or by
           telephone to Civil Engineering. AMOPS shall provide the exact location of the area
           needing sweeping and coordinate sweeper operations with the ATC tower,
           maintenance and other flying operations personnel.

     4.1.2. Airfield Mowing Schedule. The annual mowing season at Columbus AFB is
     typically mid-April through late November. The 14 CES Ground Maintenance Supervisor
     will advise AMOPS before mowing on the airfield. AMOPS will notify the ATC tower.

           4.1.2.1. Mowing at Columbus AFB is done using techniques prescribed in Columbus
           AFB BASH Plan 91-202, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH), and this instruction.

           4.1.2.2. Two-way radio contact with the ATC tower is mandatory any time a person
           or vehicle is within 100’ of the active runways. Mowing may occur outside of the
           100’ adjacent to the runways on any day without two-way radio contact with the ATC
           tower.

           4.1.2.3. AMOPS will issue a DoD local area NOTAM (Airfield Advisory) to inform
           aircrew of the affected areas being mowed within the controlled movement areas.

           4.1.2.4. 14 CES mowing crews will notify the ATC tower and AMOPS when
           mowing operations are completed for the day.

     4.1.3. Construction on the Airfield. All construction and/or maintenance work performed
     on or in the immediate vicinity of the airfield will be coordinated with and approved by
     AM and the Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) specialist prior to beginning work.
     A temporary construction waiver signed by the 14 FTW/CC must be presented to the AFM
     prior to beginning any construction on the airfield.

4.2. Determining Runway Surface Conditions (RSC). The AMOPS specialist on duty will
monitor weather conditions which can affect the RSC (rain, snow, ice, slush etc.) and determine
the RSC for runway(s) as required. For wet runways(s), AMOPS will determine RSC to include
depth of water for each runway. The individual completing the RSC checks will ensure the
dissemination of the RSC data. At a minimum, this individual will notify: ATC tower, SOF,
RAPCON, Command Post and Weather Flight.

     4.2.1. For determining the RSC, the following definitions will be used. These references
     are from AFI 13-204 and Technical Order (T.O.) 33-1-23. When water is the only form of
     visible moisture on 25 percent or more of the runway surface area (whether in isolated
     areas or not), report the RSC as "wet runway" and no RCR.
NOTE: Regardless of a Wet or Dry RSC, report the existence, location and depth of any
standing water (ponding, water patches, puddles, etc.).

4.2.2. AMOPS will report the RSC as “wet runway, to the nearest 1/10 inch”. No Runway
Condition Reading (RCR) will be reported and documented on AF IMT 3616. When
applicable and measurable, AMOPS will report "standing water" to specific outside runway
quarters.

     4.2.2.1. Outside runway quarters are defined as:

          4.2.2.1.1. For 13R/31L the outside quarters are defined as the outer 37.5 feet of
          the runway.

          4.2.2.1.2 For 13C/31C the outside quarters are defined as the outer 75 feet of
          the runway.

          4.2.2.1.3. For 13L/31R the outside quarters are defined as the outer 37.5 feet of
          the runway.

          NOTE: In accordance with the DoD Flight Information Publication (FLIP),
          IFR – Supplement, under Columbus AFB, “Caution – Exercise caution braking
          when wet, ponding conditions exist. Braking action less than expected, reduced
          runway skid resistance and high potential for hydroplaning all runways when
          wet.”

4.2.3. ATC tower will transmit the runway is “wet with standing water depth X/10 inch” to
aircrew when AMOPS informs them a runway is wet with a depth 1/10 inch or greater.
The SOF will also inform the T-1 SUP the depth of the water, when given.

4.2.4. AMOPS will give priority to the center runway, then to the inside runway, and
finally to the outside runway, or as requested by ATC tower/SOF as flying requirements
and/or weather conditions dictate.

4.2.5. Due to limited manning, the AMOPS vehicle will not normally wait longer than 10
minutes for an RSC check. If the 10-minute window is exceeded, personnel may return to
AMOPS. When a runway is identified as wet or rapidly changing weather conditions
dictate, checks will be conducted more frequently or as requested by the SOF or ATC
tower WS/SC.

4.2.6. If the SOF receives information from aircrews, RSUs, or the ATC tower indicating a
possible change in the RSC, this information will be passed to AMOPS, who will
continuously monitor weather conditions IAW AFI 13-204v3 to determine any needed
changes.

4.2.7. AMOPS will issue a NOTAM to report other than “dry” surface conditions for
runways and predominate RSC conditions IAW AFI 13-204v3.
4.3. Procedures for Conducting Runway Inspections/Checks.

     4.3.1. The AFM/AAFM and qualified AMOPS personnel are the only personnel
     authorized to conduct official runway inspections/checks.

     4.3.2. The first inspection/check of the day will be conducted prior to the first airfield
     operation. Subsequent checks will be coordinated through the SOF and ATC tower WS/SC
     following in-flight emergencies, lightning within 5 miles of the airfield and other situations
     as required.

     4.3.3. AMOPS will conduct additional visual inspections throughout the day as part of
     airfield checks or inspections as required IAW AFI 13-204v3. At a minimum an airfield
     check will be conducted after the arrival of wide body/heavy aircraft (e.g., B-52, B-747, C-
     17, C-5, KC-10, etc.) and RPA.

4.4. Procedures for Suspending Runway Operations. AM/ATC tower must temporarily
suspend/close runway operations when any unsafe condition affects runway operations (e.g.,
FOD, bird condition, snow removal, arresting systems maintenance/configuration changes,
airfield construction, pavement repair, etc.). The suspension/closure announcement will be
accompanied with the time runway operations are expected to resume. AM will complete an
airfield check and report the airfield status/runway condition prior to resuming operations.

     4.4.1. When it becomes necessary to suspend normal runway operations due to a disabled
     aircraft on the runway, normal operations will not be conducted until AMOPS inspects the
     runway. AM has the authority to impose airfield restrictions (close/suspend and resume
     airfield, runway or taxiway operations).

     4.4.2. AM will temporarily close an airfield to all traffic during hazardous weather such as
     tornadoes or hurricanes. At a minimum notify the following agencies: ATC
     Tower/RAPCON and Command Post. Secondary Crash Net (SCN) will be activated IAW
     AFI 13-204v3.

4.5. Procedures for Opening and Closing the Airfield/Runway.

     4.5.1. Airfield Opening Procedures:

           4.5.1.1. AMOPS will contact Security Forces to notify them that Airfield
           Management is open.

           4.5.1.2. AMOPS will complete a FOD check, lighting check, BASH/wildlife check
           and barrier check prior to opening the airfield.

           4.5.1.3. AMOPS will notify ATC tower when the runway can be opened. The ATC
           tower will then request the location and call sign of any vehicles to check in if not
           already called. Upon official opening of airfield by AM, ATC tower will make the
           following announcement to all agencies on the FM/Crash net. “COLUMBUS airfield
     is open, contact tower for approval onto any movement areas and active runways”.
     AMOPS shall contact Weather Flight when the airfield is called open and shall notify
     Command Post and Security Forces at a minimum of the airfield’s status.

     4.5.1.4. Under no circumstances will the airfield be opened when the ATC tower is
     closed.

4.5.2. Airfield Closing Procedures.

     4.5.2.1. AMOPS shall conduct an airfield check and complete any necessary
     documentation.

     4.5.2.2. AMOPS shall process NOTAMS when operating hours deviate from
     published hours and will coordinate changes with the following agencies at a
     minimum: ATC tower/RAPCON, Command Post and Security Forces.

     4.5.2.3. AMOPS will contact the ATC tower or SOF to ensure that wing flying has
     been terminated.

     4.5.2.4. AMOPS shall call ATC tower, Weather Flight, Command Post and Security
     Forces to advise the facilities that AMOPS and the airfield is closed. Upon official
     closing of airfield by AM, ATC tower will make the following announcement to all
     agencies on the FM/Crash net. “COLUMBUS airfield is closed.”

4.5.3. Runway Closing Procedures.

     4.5.3.1. Whenever a runway closes, the agency in control of that runway (RSU or
     ATC tower) will advise the SOF. The SOF will then determine the course of action
     (e.g., recover aircraft, divert or continue operations with restrictions).

     4.5.3.2. During normal operations, if an operational runway needs to be temporarily
     closed due to an incident or accident, AMOPs will transmit a NOTAM (if closure is
     more than 2 hours) and will notify all applicable agencies IAW with AFI 13-204v3.
     The following agencies will be notified at a minimum with all pertinent information
     to include estimated opening time, if known, and the initials/time of member notified
     will be documented on the NOTAM form or Airfield Advisory Sheet:

           4.5.3.2.1. ATC tower/RAPCON/SOF/all flying units.

           4.5.3.2.2. Memphis ARTCC.

           4.5.3.2.3. Greenwood Flight Service.

           4.5.3.2.4. Job Control (as applicable).

           4.5.3.2.5. AFM or Assistant Airfield Manager (AAM).
           4.5.3.2.6. Command Post.

     4.5.3.3. During dual/single runway procedures, notify the above agencies if it is
     probable that the remaining runway(s) could temporarily be out of service due to an
     IFE or for any other reason. This action is required to ensure prompt notification is
     made to aircraft and to preclude the hazardous situation of arriving at CAFB with no
     runway available.

     4.5.3.4. Upon opening a closed runway notify the above agencies and transmit a
     NOTAM (if required).

4.5.4. Scheduled Runway Closures: The AFM or his designated representative is
responsible for coordinating planned runway closures. MAJCOM approval is required and
requests shall be processed IAW AFI 13-204V3. When closing a runway, consideration
should be given to Prior Permission Required (PPR) and Official Business Only (OBO)
aircraft. AMOPS will complete the “Airfield Coordination Sheet” IAW the AFM’s
instructions.

NOTE: Airfield restrictions establishing limitation on the number or type of aircraft using
an airfield should be coordinated with MAJCOM, Wing/CC, OG/CC, AOF/CC, AFM, and
CP.

4.5.5. Civil Engineering shall be required to place yellow crosses, either temporary or
permanent, at both ends of the closed runway if that runway will remain closed for more
than 5 days.

NOTE: AMOPS will coordinate with OG/CC, CES, and Safety to ensure closed,
unsuitable, or non-operational areas are properly marked and published in the AOI and
FLIP. Additionally, AMOPS will publish a NOTAM to report conditions that will exist for
less than 90 days.

4.5.6. Prior to returning a closed runway to normal operations, the AM or AAM shall
perform a complete inspection of the runway to ensure it is safe to resume operations.

4.5.7. ATC tower shall make an announcement over the ramp net prior to opening the
runway(s) for the start of normal operations/hours. ATC tower shall make an
announcement over the ramp net and guard frequency to inform personnel the runway is
open after a closure during normal operating hours. ATC tower shall make an
announcement over guard frequency to inform personnel the runway is open after
suspended runway is open.

4.5.8. AMOPS will follow the same notification/documentation procedures outlined in
paragraph 4.5.3.2 (closures) when the runway is opened.
4.6. Flight Plans. All aircraft departing Air Force installations must have a flight plan on file
with AMOPS prior to takeoff. Approved canned flight plans will be accepted according to local
procedures.

     4.6.1. Aircrews shall use DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, DD Form 1801, DoD
     International Flight Plan, or other authorized forms according to AFI 11-202 Volume 3,
     General Flight Rules and FLIP General Planning. Original flight plans will not be
     accepted via radio. IAW AFI 13-204 locally filed flight plans can be amended after takeoff
     with the appropriate ATC agencies or Flight Service Station (FSS) via any means provided
     an original flight plan is on file at AMOPs. ATC Tower shall notify AMOPS of the actual
     departure/arrival time of all aircraft that depart on a DD Form 175/1801 and will notify
     AMOPS when they make an amendment to a DD Form 175/1801 flight plan that impacts
     the departure time, arrival time or final destination of an aircraft. For aircraft departing on
     canned/local area flight plans the responsible flying squadron will notify AMOPS to input
     the flight plan. IAW AETCI 11-204 the responsible flying squadron in coordination with
     the RSU Recorder will record/track takeoff and landing times along with any appropriate
     comments to ensure aircraft accountability. The RSU Recorder or the responsible flying
     squadron shall notify AMOPS immediately when an aircraft cannot be located and has
     failed to land within 30 minutes of its proposed landing time.

     4.6.2. Aircrew shall file DD Form 175 flight plans no later than 1 hour and 15 minutes
     prior to planned takeoff time.

     4.6.3. If a DD Form 175 is faxed to AMOPS, aircrew shall call AMOPS within 10 minutes
     after faxing to ensure flight plans have been received and are accurate.

     4.6.4. Squadrons shall ensure that DD Forms 175 and accompanying documents are
     retained for at least 3 months IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located
     at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm In case of accident, incident or
     ATC deviation, retain for at least 1 year after appropriate investigation is complete.

4.7. NOTAM Procedures. AMOPS is the base NOTAM dispatch center. RAPCON is
responsible for the NAVAID status and is the ATC NOTAM monitor facility for 14 FTW
operated and maintained ATC and Landing Systems (ATCALS) facilities. All NOTAMs will be
transmitted according to AFI 11-208, AFI 13-204v3 and all applicable agencies as outlined in
paragraph 4.5.3.2 (closures) will be notified. The initials/time of member notified will be
documented on the NOTAM form or Airfield Advisory Sheet.

     4.7.1. AMOPS will advise Flight Service Station and Memphis ARTCC, as applicable,
     when disseminating NOTAMs for Columbus AFB ATCALS facilities.

     4.7.2. The ATC tower will notify AMOPS and RAPCON of all changes to ATC tower
     equipment status that directly affect the control of air traffic.

     4.7.3. RAPCON will check the appropriate NOTAMs for all adjacent airports and will
     advise ATC tower and AMOPS of any pertinent NOTAMs. RAPCON will also notify
     AMOPS of status changes in all ATCALS facilities which require NOTAM action. In
     addition, RAPCON will notify the following agencies as appropriate:

           4.7.3.1. Memphis ARTCC.

           4.7.3.2. Atlanta ARTCC.

           4.7.3.3. Meridian Approach.

           4.7.3.4. Birmingham Approach.

           4.7.3.5. ATC tower.

           4.7.3.6. Consolidated Maintenance Support Staff (14 CS/CMSS).

4.8. Flight Information Publications (FLIP).

     4.8.1. AM will order FLIP and aeronautical charts for base units according to established
     distribution procedures. 14 FTW flying squadrons have FLIP accounts and are to use
     AMOPS products for flight planning only.

     4.8.2. Prepare and coordinate nonprocedural FLIP changes with appropriate local agencies
     before submitting according to General Planning, Chapter 11. The AFM approves
     nonprocedural FLIP change requests. TERPS will prepare and coordinate procedural
     changes.


4.9. Airfield Waivers. AM will coordinate on all waivers that affect airfield criteria.

     4.9.1. AM will maintain a copy of the MAJCOM approved airfield waiver package and
     ensure access to all AM personnel that conduct airfield inspection/checks.

     4.9.2. AM, CE, Wing Safety and TERPS will participate in the annual review of waivers to
     airfield criteria.

     4.9.3. Do not authorize temporary airfield construction unless a waiver has been approved
     by the 14 FTW/CC (See Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport
     Planning and Design Criteria.). A copy of the approved waiver must be provided to the
     AFM prior to the start of construction.

           4.9.3.1. The AFM, Flight Safety, SFS, and the TERPS specialist must be coordinated
           with prior to beginning any construction/repairs on the airfield or in areas that could
           affect flying operations. Appropriate NOTAMs, temporary waivers, and/or closures
           may be required. AMOPS shall advise the Control Tower about any personnel or
           equipment operating within the CMA. Construction personnel will inform AMOPS
           when they start work each day and when they stop work each day.
          4.9.3.2. The AFM will conduct and document an inspection with representatives
          from 14 CES and Flight Safety, before and after completion of any airfield
          construction, changes or additions to the flying mission or changes affecting existing
          aircraft parking/taxi procedures. Emphasis will be on mission impact of affected
          area(s), and necessary changes to the safety plan and construction, temporary or
          permanent waiver.

4.10. Waivers to Airfield/Airspace Criteria:

     4.10.1. Request for waivers to airfield, terminal airspace, and TERPS criteria should be
     submitted to 14 CES (Community Planner). All requests for airfield, airspace and TERPS
     waivers will be coordinated with 14 OSS/OSA prior to submission. 14 CES will provide a
     copy of all approved waivers to 14 OSS/OSA.

     4.10.2. MAJCOM/CV is the approval authority for all operational waivers involving
     airfield and/or airspace operations, unless delegated to MAJCOM or other authority.
     Waiver implementation entails posting approved waiver to the AETC Community Planner
     CoP, forwarding approved waiver package to senior leadership, and briefing new waivers
     at the Airfield Operations Board (AOB)

     4.10.3. The number and status of permanent/temporary waivers is defined in the waiver
     package in the AFM’s office; additionally, this information is briefed quarterly during the
     AOB and reported in the AOB minutes. If necessary, contact the AFM for the most current
     list of airfield waivers.

4.11. Prior Permission Required (PPR). Columbus AFB is PPR at all times as published in
DoD FLIP and Official Business Only (OBO) if a NOTAM is issued. AMOPS will issue PPR
numbers once necessary information is received from transient aircrew.

     4.11.1. AMOPS will limit transient traffic to PPR restrictions, except aircraft with DV-6 or
     higher grade on board, aircraft emergencies, or as an alternate for IFR flights.

     4.11.2. Aero Medical Evacuation (AIREVAC) or Special Air Missions (SAM) are exempt
     from PPR/OBO restrictions, but are required to obtain a PPR number for
     tracking/notification.

4.12. Air Evacuation Notification. AMOPS is designated as the agency responsible for
coordinating support for Air Evacuation flight information. ATC tower will notify AMOPS
when an Air Evacuation flight is approximately 15 miles from landing, time/workload
permitting. AMOPS will make appropriate notifications IAW internal checklist.

4.13. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Notification/Handling.

     4.13.1. AMOPS is the focal point for DV arrival/departure notifications. When notified of
     an arrival with DVs, AMOPS will obtain rank, name, position, call sign, type aircraft,
     estimated time of arrival (ETA) and purpose of visit. AMOPS will notify Command Post,
     Base Protocol and OG via email of scheduled DV inbounds. Upon receipt of DV inbound
     message AMOPS will relay the information to the Command Post, RAPCON, ATC Tower,
     SOF and Transient Alert.

           4.13.1.1. ATC Tower shall inform AMOPS of DV aircraft landing time. RAPCON
           shall inform AMOPS when aircraft carrying DV code is in Columbus AFB airspace
           (approximately 40NM). This is limited to one phone call only and is secondary to
           ATC services. The SOF will monitor the aircraft’s progress and call over the
           commanders net when the aircraft is 25NM and 10NM to fly. Include the aircraft call
           sign, distance and estimated chock time.

     4.13.2. Landing center runway: DV aircraft may land on the center runway and exit at
     Taxiway H. If necessary, the ATC tower may approve a 180 turn on the runway for exit
     at Taxiway H. When landing runway 13C and Taxiway H is missed, the ATC tower will
     direct the aircraft to exit at the end of the runway.

     4.13.3. Departing center runway: DV aircraft should use normal taxi procedures.

     4.13.4. The ATC tower will make the DV aircraft number one for departure after entering
     the hammerhead.

     NOTE: This is secondary to priorities listed in JO7110.65 and paragraph 3.15 of this
     regulation.

     4.13.5. At the discretion of the ATC tower WS/SC, DV aircraft may be taken to Taxiway
     H and back-taxied to the approach end of the active runway.

4.14. Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo Procedures. If any aircraft advises the ATC tower or
RAPCON that dangerous or inert cargo/nuclear weapons are being carried, the RAPCON/ATC
tower will notify AMOPS and/or have the aircraft contact AMOPS via pilot to dispatch.
AMOPS will obtain the net explosive weight and hazardous classification if it wasn’t provided in
PPR coordination. When a prior load message has been received, only the estimated time of
arrival and call sign need to be passed. The ATC tower activates the primary crash alarm system
and passes cargo information for aircraft not pre-coordinated. All explosives-loaded aircraft are
parked at the SAC alert area, as directed by AMOPS.

4.15. Wear of Hats. With the exception of 14 FTW MX personnel, the wear of hats is
prohibited on the flightline during operating hours, to include the flightline side of building 847
(AMOPS). Hats or caps will not be worn in the intake danger zone of the aircraft while the
engines are operating. Personnel wearing hats on the flightline will secure the hat with a lanyard.

4.16. Flightline Smoking Policy. Smoking is prohibited in aircraft maintenance facilities, the
flight line areas and weapons storage and maintenance areas, except where designated by the
installation fire chief in coordination with the functional manager and (or) supervisor.
4.17. Snow Removal Operations. CAFB does not conduct snow removal operations due to its
geographical location.

4.18. Bird/Wildlife Control. BASH program guidelines and duties are described in CAFB Plan
91-202, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan.

4.19. Bird Watch Conditions. BASH conditions are described in CAFB Plan 91-202, Bird
Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan.

4.20. Photography on the Flightline. Procedures outlined in CAFBI 31-101.

4.21. Flightline Visitor Escort Procedures. Visitors to the transient ramp must check-in/out
with AMOPS. Aircraft commander approval is required to visit an aircraft. Visitors must be
escorted to and from the aircraft by authorized personnel. In addition, visitors are not authorized
on the flightline when the airfield is closed without prior approval from AMOPS. During certain
events, such as graduation and public events, visitors may be permitted on designated portions of
the airfield for the duration of that event.

NOTE: During FPCON CHARLIE or higher, the aircraft parking ramps are controlled areas
and must be accessed at entry control points located along the ramp. Aircrew must be listed on
the squadron access list or escorted by proper authority.

4.22. Classified Material Storage. Command Post shall store classified materials for transient
aircrews.
Chapter 5

T-6 OPERATIONS

5.1. Flying Status Common to All Airframes.

     5.1.1. Restricted. Weather conditions and/or facilities do not permit full use of training
     areas, VFR patterns or outlying instrument facilities.

     5.1.2. OPS/Weather Recall. Conditions require recovery to CAFB. Coordinate all
     launches with the SOF.

     5.1.3. Area Hold. Conditions prohibit normal aircraft recovery to CAFB. Coordinate all
     launches with the SOF. Refer to paragraph 3.21.2.4.

     5.1.4. Standby. All local flying is suspended for an indefinite period of time until
     conditions improve to support a better status.

     5.1.5. Terminate. Local flying terminated for the remainder of the day.

     5.1.6. Slots. Weather is 300/1. Slots provide the capability to continue local flying
     operations when weather precludes simultaneous T-38C and T-6 recoveries because an IFR
     approach to Runway 13C/31C is required by all aircraft. Plan all approaches to a full stop.
     Aircrew requiring a radar delay or multiple approaches must coordinate approval through
     SUP/Top 3 to the SOF. The squadron SUP/Top 3s will inform the SOF of coordinated slot
     times. Slot times are a landing window. For planning purposes, SUP/Top 3s will plan for
     no more than 1 aircraft to land every 3 minutes. All squadron aircraft must land within the
     agreed upon window. If actual or forecast weather precludes a wing landing, extra time
     must be added for single ship landings. Cross-country launches or out and backs should be
     coordinated with all other squadron SUP/Top 3s and the SOF shall be notified of the plan.

            5.1.6.1. Slot times will be separated by the following times:

                 5.1.6.1.1. Changing from T-6 to T-38C and vice versa - 20 min

            5.1.6.2. When wing flying status is slots, T-1s will coordinate with other squadron
            SUP/Top 3s on their scheduled takeoff and land times.

5.2. T-6 Flying Status.

     5.2.1. Unrestricted. Weather and facilities permit full use of all training areas for both dual
     and solo missions.

     5.2.2. Wing Solo. Weather 2,500/3. In-flight visibility 5 miles or greater. Weather
     permits formations with solos to maintain VMC. Solos will remain clear of clouds.
5.2.3. Pattern Solo. Weather 2,500/3. In-flight visibility 5 miles or greater. Solos are not
permitted outside of the VFR pattern. Weather permits VFR pattern operations including
breakout and re-entry.

5.2.4. Dual. Weather 2,500/3. No solo sorties permitted. Weather permits VFR pattern
operations including breakout and re-entry.

5.2.5. Any combination of the statuses in 5.1.1. and 5.2.1. through 5.2.4. may be set for
individual MOAs. For example, a T-6 flying status of “Wing Solo South, Dual West” or
“Restricted – No solos to Gunshy” may be used to facilitate proper determination of the
actual status for geographically separated working areas.

5.2.6. Restricted Overhead (RSU controls 13R/31L) -Weather 1,500/3 (2,100/3 required to
enter the pattern via Marble/Stennis). Aircraft will enter the VFR pattern via initial takeoff,
straight in from radar termination point, or closed/crosswind from the center runway.
Maximum number of aircraft in the VFR pattern is eight. No breakouts. Aircrew will carry
straight through initial with straight-ins between 5 and 2NM. Runway 13C/31C arrivals
must full stop or have sufficient fuel to return to RAPCON for vectors to another
instrument approach.

NOTE: If status is less than Dual, T-6s may not fly center runway approaches without SOF
approval.

     5.2.6.1. VFR Straight-in. Weather 1,500/3. At the discretion of the RSU controller
     and with SOF and T-6 SUP approval, restricted overhead status may be modified to
     operate as follows: Sunfish is restricted, straight-ins to a full stop only.” This status
     is used with few or scattered clouds interfering with pattern operations, but not
     straight-ins. Enter the pattern via a full-stop straight-in from radar termination point.
     Center runway arrivals must full stop. Initial takeoffs must depart the pattern.

5.2.7. IFR Recovery. Weather requirements are based on the published circling approach
minimums. Aircraft will execute the published circling approaches to circle for a full stop
on 13R/31L. Weather status requirements may be reduced to 300/1 for 31C/13C
approaches if T-38s are not flying. MARSA applies IAW para 3.26.

 5.2.8. Contact Recoveries (Tower controls 13R/31L) -Weather is greater than or equal to
1500/3 in the pattern and between 1600 and 2100 over radar termination tower will control
runway 13R/31L. The status will be “contact recoveries” and T-6A aircrews will use the
following guidance:

     5.2.8.1. Arrival/Entering pattern. Aircraft will enter the VFR pattern via initial
     takeoff or a straight in flown from a contact approach. Aircraft will not plan to enter
     the pattern from the center runway unless directed by ATC. When weather precludes
     a VFR descent below minimum vectoring altitude, aircrew may request a contact
     approach if able to remain clear of clouds and have 1NM mile visibility. Once clear
     of clouds, aircrew will declare “contact”, receive approach clearance from RAPCON,
achieve appropriate VFR cloud clearances (1500-3), and cancel IFR as soon as
practical. Aircrew will then enter the pattern via straight in. Aircrews will let
RAPCON know as soon as possible if they are unable to cancel IFR. Once VFR
aircrews will switch to tower frequency and request a straight in. Tower will approve
these straight ins to the maximum extent possible. However, they may tell aircrew to
report initial in order to facilitate traffic flow. NOTE: The “contact” approach option
is available only under tower control and may not be used under RSU control. For
Rwy 13R, RAPCON may vector crews to the vicinity of “crossroad” instead of
Stennis. If this is the case, RAPCON will inform crews which point they are being
vectored to.

5.2.8.2. Pattern. Once in the pattern aircraft will squawk 0000, follow the normal
pattern ground track, and make normal Sunfish radio calls in addition to FAA
required radio calls unless otherwise told by tower. (Tower may have aircraft extend
upwind, break with a straight in between 5 and 2, or have an aircraft established in the
pattern fly a straight in to facilitate traffic flow.) If a straight in calls fuel at 5 miles,
tower may ask that aircraft side step to the center runway to facilitate traffic flow.
The maximum number of aircraft in the tower controlled pattern is six and the Tower
Watch Supervisor has the authority to reduce that based on ATC safety of flight.
Departures have priority and depending on traffic tower may not allow aircraft to
pattern delay. Aircrew will fly a maximum of three patterns per sortie (including the
straight in if accomplished) unless otherwise approved by the Squadron Sup. There
will be no low or high breakouts or ELPs. Aircrews will minimize pattern straight-
ins and will not request them with more than three aircraft in the pattern.

5.2.8.3. Departure. Once cleared for takeoff (if straight out) or approved to depart the
pattern (if pattern delaying), aircrews will fly the instrument (obstacle) departure
procedure. Aircrews should NOTE: their IFR clearance is already active when
departing with tower and should not wait to hear “proceed on course”.

5.2.8.4. Formation. Options for formation recoveries (in order of preference) will be:
1) split the formation in the area prior to recovery 2) formation landing from the
straight-in 3) sequential closed/crosswind from a formation low approach or 4)
standard pitchout if tower directs the formation to report initial. Additionally,
formations will not plan to rejoin in the pattern for training purposes.

5.2.8.5. Deconfliction. Tower needs 3,000 spacing behind a touch and go or a full
stop. Landing aircraft must be off runway and maintaining forward momentum
beyond the hold short line before aircraft begin takeoff roll. Tower is not allowed to
use restricted low approaches for deconfliction. As a last resort they will tell an
aircraft on final to “Go around”.

5.2.8.6. GTR Return. If returning to termination from the GTR VFR pattern, aircrew
will fly heading 180 (for Rwy 18) or 300 (for Rwy 36), climb to 1200’ MSL, and
contact arrival on channel 14 for vectors for sequencing. Aircrews are encouraged to
request an IFR clearance from GTR to radar termination.
5.3. VFR Traffic Pattern Procedures. UHF shall be the primary frequency used in the
Sunfish pattern. Aircraft shall squawk 0000 while in the VFR pattern. When departing the VFR
pattern, squawk the ATC assigned code.

     5.3.1. When ATC tower controls the pattern, standard FAA communications shall be used
     by aircrew and controllers.

     5.3.2. T-6 Pattern Description. T-6 groundtracks and reporting points are depicted in
     Attachment 5. The overhead pattern is flown at 1,200' MSL and 200 KIAS.

          5.3.2.1. Tower Pattern Use. When ATC tower controls the inside runway, the T-6
          pattern for groundtracks and reporting points should be used. Tower may amend the
          pattern as necessary.

     5.3.3. Low closed patterns are prohibited southwest of the airfield.

     5.3.4. T-6 VFR Pattern Departure Procedures are described in Attachment 13.

     5.3.5. Night Pattern Procedures. Aircraft shall land on the centerline with a minimum of
     6,000’ spacing between all aircraft.

     5.3.6. T-6 Practice Emergency Landing Procedures (ELP).

          5.3.6.1. ELP approaches requested under Sunfish control. ELPs will be coordinated
          and approved using standard verbiage and procedures in accordance with AFI11-2T-6
          V3, CAFB Supplement.

          5.3.6.2. Practice ELP approaches requested under tower’s control are only approved
          between sunrise and sunset. ELP will be coordinated and approved using standard
          verbiage and procedures in accordance with this instruction. ATC tower may
          disapprove the ELP approach at any time.

                5.3.6.2.1. The ELP will be initiated from High Key or Low Key. The T-6 may
                make any type landing from this maneuver. The ceiling must be at least 1,000’
                above the approved high key/low key altitude and flight/ground visibility must
                be reported to be at least 3 miles (FAA JO 7610.4). High key is directly over
                the first third of the runway at 2,700 to 3,200’ MSL and low key is at 1,700’
                MSL abeam an aim-point which is 500-1,000 feet short of the intended
                touchdown point. All turns will be made to the Southwest unless otherwise
                directed.

                5.3.6.2.2. ELP entry will normally be made from initial or the departure leg
                depending on traffic complexity.

                5.3.6.2.3. High key from initial. Aircrew shall transmit, “INITIAL, REQUEST
                HIGH KEY”. The tower will transmit, “REPORT HIGH KEY” if approved or
“UNABLE HIGH KEY” if disapproved followed with alternate ATC
instructions. If approved, aircrew shall climb to an altitude between 2,700’ and
3,200’ MSL (high key) and maintain VFR cloud clearances. Once at the high
key position, the aircrew shall report “HIGH KEY.” The tower will either
transmit “REPORT LOW KEY” for authorization to begin the ELP, or “HOLD
AT HIGH KEY” to begin a 360-degree level orbit. Upon reaching the high key
position again, the same process applies.

5.3.6.2.4. Low key from initial. Aircrew will transmit “INITIAL, REQUEST
LOW KEY”. Tower will transmit “REPORT LOW KEY”. The aircraft will
climb to low key altitude (1,700’ MSL) while in the break. At low key, the
aircraft will transmit “LOW KEY, GEAR DOWN” to receive a landing
clearance from tower. If the request for low key from initial is disapproved, the
tower will transmit “UNABLE LOW KEY”, after which the aircrew will
perform an overhead pattern.

5.3.6.2.5. High key from departure leg. Aircrew shall transmit, “REQUEST
CLOSED HIGH KEY”. The tower will transmit, “REPORT HIGH KEY” if
approved or “UNABLE HIGH KEY” if disapproved followed with alternate
ATC instructions. If approved, the aircrew shall climb to 3,200’ MSL for high
key. Once at the high key position, the aircrew shall report “HIGH KEY.” The
tower will either transmit “REPORT LOW KEY” for authorization to begin the
ELP, or “HOLD AT HIGH KEY” to begin a 360-degree level orbit. Upon
reaching the high key position again, the same process applies.

5.3.6.2.6. Low key from departure leg. Aircrew will transmit “REQUEST
CLOSED, LOW KEY”. The tower will transmit “REPORT LOW KEY” or
“UNABLE LOW KEY, CLOSED APPROVED”. If low key is approved, the
aircraft will report “HIGH DOWNWIND” when established on High Closed
Downwind. At low key, the aircraft will transmit “LOW KEY, GEAR DOWN”
to receive a landing clearance from tower. If a low key request from closed
pattern is denied, but closed is approved, normal closed procedures apply (tower
will not allow aircraft to climb to high closed downwind altitude). If tower
should transmit “UNABLE LOW KEY, UNABLE CLOSED”, the aircrew will
depart the closed pattern and enter the crosswind pattern.

5.3.6.2.7. No aircraft will be cleared for takeoff on the runway to which the
ELP is being conducted once the ELP aircraft departs high key.

5.3.6.2.8. ELP aircraft will not be allowed to depart high key with an aircraft in
the initial pattern going to the same runway.

5.3.6.2.9. IFR/VFR straight-in approaches going to the same runway as the
ELP aircraft must be within one mile final or outside of 5NM prior to the ELP
aircraft leaving high key.
                5.3.6.2.10. The minimum separation standard between successive ELP aircraft
                is the second aircraft will not be cleared out of high key until the preceding
                aircraft reports low key.

                5.3.6.2.11. Tower controllers must have visual contact or tower radar display
                position confirmation with ELP traffic when the aircraft leaves high key or the
                aircraft will be broken out and sent back to high key to hold or given alternate
                ATC instructions.

                5.3.6.2.12. If required for sequencing, tower may direct holding at high key.
                Holding will be in the same direction as the pattern to be flown. Aircraft are not
                allowed to hold at low key.

                5.3.6.2.13. If tower clearance is not received at low key or traffic dictates
                discontinuing the ELP, the aircrew shall report “GOING AROUND.” Turn
                parallel to the intended runway but offset over Taxiway A so as not to cross the
                intended runway centerline, maintain 1,700’ MSL and follow tower
                instructions.

          5.3.6.3. Transient aircraft are not authorized to conduct simulated ELPs at CAFB.
          Simulated flameout procedures do not exist for Columbus Air Force Base.

          5.3.6.4. The following NTA (non-towered airfields) may be utilized for ELP training:
          Columbus Lowndes County Airport (UBS), Houston Municipal Airport (M44),
          Okolona Municipal-Richard Stovall Field Airport (5A4) (Do not use when Columbus
          AFB is on runway 13), George Downer (Aliceville) Airport (AIV), and North Pickens
          (Reform) Airport (3M8) (Right traffic to runway 1). The following towered fields
          may also be used for this training: Golden Triangle Regional Airport (GTR), Tupelo
          Regional Airport (TUP), Tuscaloosa Regional Airport (TCL), Greenwood-Leflore
          Airport (GWO) and Gunshy (1MS8). A diagram of the ELP practice fields is located
          at Attachment 16.

5.4. Radar Traffic Patterns and Speeds. Radar patterns are depicted in Attachment 11. T-6
Aircraft shall fly 200 KIAS on RADAR downwind and base until on final approach and inside
13 DME.

5.5. Standard/Local Climb Out. In order to protect the 360 degree overhead pattern when the
weather is VFR (3.7), the standard instrument climb out procedure for runway 13C/31C is, “FLY
RUNWAY HEADING. CROSS DEPARTURE END AT OR BELOW 700’. CLIMB AND
MAINTAIN 4000’. CONTACT DEPARTURE CHANNEL 16.” When the weather is less than
VFR (3.7), "FLY RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 4,000’. CONTACT
DEPARTURE CHANNEL 16." RAPCON may abbreviate climb out instructions for local
aircraft by stating, “AFTER COMPLETING LOW APPROACH/TOUCH AND GO/OPTION,
EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT”.
5.6. IFR/VFR Clearances.

     5.6.1. Aircrew will receive their IFR/VFR clearance prior to taxi for all missions that will
     depart ATC tower or RSU controlled airspace. Clearance delivery will issue Class C
     departure instructions, squawk, and a frequency for VFR departures (If other than the
     inside runway, T-6 will advise clearance delivery which runway they will depart from). If
     an extended delay is expected with the clearance, aircrew may taxi and inform Ground
     Control “AWAITING CLEARANCE”. Aircrew will inform Ground Control if
     encountering a problem with the clearance and contact Squadron Ops for assistance.

     NOTE: During Radar Outage procedures, clearances will be handled IAW paragraph
     3.21.

     5.6.2. On VFR pattern-only sorties, which do not require an IFR clearance, the aircrew
     will state “PATTERN ONLY” to Ground Control on taxi request.

     5.6.3. Local Night Sortie Clearances. Clearance Delivery assigns the night route issuing
     IFR clearance.

     5.6.4. Multiple Radar Patterns. No more than five local aircraft will be scheduled in the
     radar traffic pattern during multiple radar pattern operations. If the pattern becomes
     saturated with more than five aircraft, RAPCON may direct aircraft to the VFR pattern or
     to full stop.

     5.6.5. Any time an aircraft departs from an RSU controlled runway, it will be a VFR
     departure even when an IFR clearance has been issued. T-6 IFR clearance will be activated
     upon receipt of "PROCEED ON COURSE" by RAPCON. “RADAR CONTACT” only
     confirms the T-6 is identified on radar for flight following. Aircraft are responsible for
     separation between themselves and other aircraft within a practice area. RAPCON assumes
     separation responsibility when an aircraft clears the lateral/vertical boundary of the
     appropriate practice area.

     5.6.6. Canceling IFR/Flight Following. To reduce verbiage, RAPCON may acknowledge
     14 FTW aircraft canceling IFR or flight following with “C/S, ROGER”. Aircrew will
     understand that radar service is terminated, will squawk stand-by or the appropriate code.

     5.6.7. IFR Recovery/Slots Status. Prior to departing on either status, aircrew must receive
     an IFR clearance. The IFR clearance is effective once cleared for takeoff by the ATC
     tower.

5.7. Departures.

     5.7.1. Sunfish VFR Pattern Departure IFR Pickup. When departing the RSU controlled
     traffic pattern, all T-6s will maintain VFR. Ninety-second spacing is required between
     aircraft. When cleared for takeoff, aircraft shall squawk normal. When aircraft is clear of
     the VFR pattern, aircrew shall contact Departure Control CH 4. IFR clearance will become
effective once the RAPCON controller states: “(CALL SIGN), PROCEED ON COURSE.”
This confirms the aircraft has been cleared for the departure or transition issued by
Clearance Delivery and the IFR clearance is activated.

     5.7.1.1 Cross-Country / Out and Back (DD175). Aircraft will fly “VFR PATTERN
     DEPARTURE PROCEDURES”, per the IFG, until told to “proceed on course”, at
     which point aircraft is cleared to initial fix as listed below.

           5.7.1.1.1. Westbound departure will file IGB.SQS as initial route of flight.

           5.7.1.1.2. Northbound departure will file CBM293020. TUP as initial route of
           flight. Aircraft will be restricted at or below 7000’ until clear of Columbus 1
           and 3 MOAs.

           5.7.1.1.3. Eastbound departure off of RWY 31L will file IGB.MINIM as initial
           route of flight. Eastbound departure off of RWY 13R will file MINIM as initial
           fix. Aircraft departing off of RWY 13R will comply with “VFR PATTERN
           DEPARTURE PROCEDURES”, per Attachment 13, until intercepting V-
           245/V-278 to MINIM, then as filed to ensure safe separation from
           arriving/departing aircraft from the center runway.

5.7.2. Clearance Limits on Departure.

     5.7.2.1. To comply with Columbus AFB Class C airspace, aircrew must establish
     two-way radio communication with RAPCON prior to 7 DME and 3,500’ MSL. If
     unable, aircraft shall remain inside 7 DME and below 3,500' MSL and return to the
     radar termination point. Another departure from the Sunfish pattern may be
     attempted.

     5.7.2.2. If for any reason (separation, workload, etc.) the RAPCON states return to
     the practice area (Sunfish), remain inside the practice area and contact the appropriate
     RSU.

     5.7.2.3. If not given “PROCEED ON COURSE” by RAPCON, and the weather will
     not allow a VFR climb to 3,000' MSL, aircraft shall remain clear of the breakout
     area/VFR entry point and continue with the departure groundtrack. If “PROCEED
     ON COURSE” is not received prior to CBM 7 DME and aircraft is unable to continue
     VFR, aircraft shall initiate a descending turn toward the radar termination point and
     return to the pattern.

5.7.3. During Restricted Overhead status, multiple straight-INS require prior coordination
with the SUP, SOF, and RAPCON. On initial contact with Columbus Departure Control
(Ch 4), aircraft shall request radar vectors back to the radar termination point. The original
flight plan will remain open until activated on a subsequent departure.
     5.7.4. If departing local area VFR, aircraft shall contact Clearance Delivery for a squawk
     and advise them of the requested profile (Bengal, Buzzsaw, GTR or Macon). Aircraft will
     contact Departure Control (Ch 4) for Class C service and request flight following. Aircraft
     will fly the profile groundtrack to 10 DME and then proceed via flight planned route.

     5.7.5. For departure to an area or fix following an instrument delay, aircraft shall contact
     Sunfish for departure sequencing. If no conflict exists, expect clearance to fly the standard
     turn out of traffic. If delayed in the VFR pattern, aircraft shall squawk 0000 until pattern
     departure.

     5.7.6. All sorties are expected to perform a rolling takeoff unless prior notice is given to
     the RSU/ATC tower. Aircrew desiring a static takeoff will advise the RSU/ATC tower
     they are "STATIC" when arriving at the number one position.

     5.7.7. Instrument Trail Departure. If unable to maintain trail, the lead aircraft should
     contact ATC immediately. The formation is MARSA until ATC issues separate clearance
     to individual aircraft.

          5.7.7.1. Takeoff spacing will be no less than 20 seconds.

          5.7.7.2. If a visual join up cannot be accomplished at level-off, the lead aircraft may
          query ATC for a 1,000’ of altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft or element.

          5.7.7.3. Aircrew will include “XX SECOND TRAIL DEPARTURE” when
          requesting clearance, taxi, and takeoff.

          5.7.7.4. When airborne, in a nonstandard formation, only the last aircraft will squawk
          0400.

          5.7.7.5. Aircrew will inform RAPCON when standard formation is achieved.
          Formations must be rejoined to standard formation prior to leaving Columbus
          airspace or coordinate for separate clearances.

5.8. Radar Termination Points into Sunfish.

     5.8.1. Aircraft shall descend no lower than the Minimum Vectoring Altitude (Attachment
     22) until canceling IFR.

     5.8.2. The radar termination points are defined as:

          5.8.2.1. Marble (Rwy 31 for T-6 use) [CBM 179/007]. Defined by the Mitchell
          Engineering building on Highway 45 North.

          5.8.2.2. Stennis (Rwy 13 for T-6 use) [CBM 196/008]. Defined by the lock and dam
          located on Columbus Lake.
          5.8.2.3. Aircraft shall make every effort to avoid over-flying populated areas at low
          altitude and advise RAPCON of deviations.

     5.8.3. All aircrew will monitor RAPCON and squawk assigned code until within
     approximately 2 miles of the radar termination point (IFR or VFR). RAPCON may
     continue to provide vectors after the aircrew has cancelled IFR to aid in separation between
     other aircraft on recovery. Aircrew shall comply with these vectors until the conflict is
     resolved either by visual contact or other means.

        5.8.3.1. When approaching the radar termination point and able to proceed VFR,
        aircraft shall cancel IFR with RAPCON. RAPCON will respond with “ROGER”
        meaning radar service is terminated, squawk 0000.

                5.8.3.1.1. T-6s shall remain outside 7 DME until reaching the radar termination
                point. After canceling IFR, aircrew shall change to Sunfish (Ch 2) and report
                “Marble” or “Stennis”. If unable to cancel IFR due to frequency congestion,
                aircraft will proceed to the radar termination point and continue to attempt to
                cancel IFR. If still unable to cancel IFR due to radio congestion within one mile
                of the termination point the IFR clearance will be automatically cancelled upon
                squawking 0000. Aircrew shall then switch to Sunfish frequency. After
                crossing the radar termination point, aircraft shall follow their respective
                groundtrack and be at 1,200’ MSL no later than radar initial (31L) or the 7-mile-
                farm (13R).

5.9. Radar Vector to Initial Procedures.

     5.9.1. Radar vectors to initial may be conducted at anytime the ATC tower has operational
     control of the center and outside and/or inside runways, traffic permitting.

     5.9.2. Aircrew shall request the overhead approach on initial contact with RAPCON or
     prior to reaching 15 flying miles from the runway. Aircrew shall report, “COLUMBUS
     APPROACH, (CALL SIGN), 20 MILES SOUTHEAST WITH (ATIS), REQUESTING
     OVERHEAD (TYPE LANDING)”.

5.10. Center Runway Arrival Procedures.

     5.10.1. Contact Straight-In Approach. Aircrew shall declare “CONTACT” with RAPCON
     prior to 10 DME, but not prior to base leg. After RAPCON approves the approach, aircrew
     shall maintain 2,000’ MSL until intercepting a visual glidepath. Runway centerline will be
     established prior to 10 DME and maintained to the runway.

     5.10.2. The ATC tower will direct all frequency changes to departure/arrival. When the
     aircrew requests to stay with the ATC tower in the VFR pattern, IFR clearance is
     terminated after crossing the runway threshold on IFR approaches.
     5.10.3. All T-6 aircrew will coordinate with the SUP and obtain SOF approval before
     conducting center runway approaches unless the T-38C/T-1 status is Dual or better.

5.11. VFR Arrivals. During recovery, aircraft shall contact Columbus Approach at
approximately 30NM or as soon as possible after ELP training is terminated at an outlying non-
towered airfield for radar advisory service and runway approach clearance.

5.12. Drag Procedures.

     5.12.1. The Drag procedure allows a formation to achieve nonstandard formation spacing
     on final. The trailing aircraft gains separation by reducing airspeed and shall squawk 0400.
     All communications are directed to the lead aircraft.

     5.12.2. The lead aircraft will request the drag procedure upon initial call to ATC. Aircraft
     shall accomplish the drag and approach in daytime, during VMC conditions.

     5.12.3. If landing clearance is canceled, both aircraft shall fly runway heading until turning
     crosswind or, if IMC, lead shall climb to 4,000' MSL and the wingman shall climb to 3,000'
     MSL following standard climb out instructions until separate clearances are obtained.

5.13. Split-to-Land Approach Procedures.

     5.13.1. Split-to-Land maneuvers are authorized for all 14 FTW aircraft. Aircrew and ATC
     may request a split-to-Land maneuver for more expeditious recoveries.

           5.13.1.1. Weather conditions for split-to-land maneuvers must be at or above the
           sidestep minimums for the approach being flown. In the absence of sidestep
           minimums, circling minimums will be used.

           5.13.1.2. ATC tower must have control of all of the runways involved.

     5.13.2. In order to request a split-to-land maneuver, aircrew must either:

           5.13.2.1. Advise RAPCON of request for Split-to-Land maneuver and state type of
           landing when requesting an approach prior to 10 miles. RAPCON shall contact ATC
           tower local controller for approval to allow a split-to-land maneuver.

           5.13.2.2. Aircrew shall request a Split-to-Land maneuver with ATC tower prior to
           the Final Approach Fix.

     5.13.3. Split-to-Land maneuvers may be executed off all approaches and will commence
     no earlier than 5 DME and no later than 3 DME. Flight lead shall advise RAPCON when
     commencing the split-to-land maneuver. Aircrew shall maintain their separation during the
     split-to-land maneuver.
     NOTE: When controlling other aircraft in conjunction with a flight which will execute a
     Split-to-Land, the rule is, the flight which has been cleared for a Split-to-Land “OWNS”
     both runways until the last element lands.

     5.13.4. Split-to-Land maneuvers shall terminate in a full stop. If unable to full stop, VFR
     aircraft shall maintain VFR and contact ATC tower. IFR aircraft shall execute climb out or
     proceed as directed by RAPCON. Aircrew shall maintain their own separation upon
     missed approach and until standard separation is achieved.

5.14. T-6 MOA Procedures (CBM RAPCON Controlled Airspace). MOA procedures
common to all airframes are located in section 3.25. On departure, aircrew shall request sector
assignments with Columbus Approach (Ch 8/18) and may expect low block of 8,000’ to 14,000’
or high block of 16,000’ to 22,000’.

     5.14.1. Clearance from CAFB. When approved, the aircraft is cleared to CAFB via VFR
     pattern departure procedures or published instrument (obstacle) departure procedure as
     appropriate, then assigned profile/canned flight plan. Aircraft shall climb and maintain
     15,000’ and the departure frequency will be Ch 4.

     5.14.2. Area Entry. Aircraft should expect departure control to issue a frequency change
     to Columbus Approach (Ch 8) prior to reaching the CBM 293/09 (BENRE) or Ch 18 prior
     to reaching CBM 170/15 (BUZLI).

           5.14.2.1. South Area Entry from Gunshy. Aircraft should expect either Columbus
           Approach or Meridian Approach to issue a frequency change to Columbus Approach
           (Ch 18) for area assignment.

     5.14.3. Area assignment will be made on initial contact with RAPCON on Ch 8 (CBM1)
     or Ch 18 (MEI1E). Once established in the area, aircrew shall switch to Area Monitor on
     Ch 9 (CBM1) or Ch 19 (MEI1E) and report, "ESTABLISHED”. Aircrew must ensure
     Area Monitor acknowledges and shall monitor this frequency until ready for recovery.

           5.14.3.1. Formations will use a combination of areas 1/3, 2/4, 5 or 6 in the western
           areas. In the southern areas, T-6 formations will use a combination of area red/green,
           area white or blue. Any one surge area in the east part of CBM1 MOA is large
           enough for a T-6 formation.

     5.14.4. Priorities. When a T-6 MOA is full, the MOA monitor will make the following
     broadcast: “ATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT, THE WEST/SOUTH MOA IS FULL”. The
     RAPCON Watch Supervisor will notify the SOF. Aircraft that have completed mission
     requirements should initiate recovery. The T-6 SUP may prioritize aircraft recovery and
     relay that information to the SOF for RAPCON coordination.

     5.14.5. FCF and spin sorties normally use area 6. The high and low sectors in the west
     MOA, including the sterile block, may be combined on FCF and spin sorties.
     5.14.6. Area Exit.

          5.14.6.1. Aircraft shall obtain ATIS (273.5 or VOR voice) and remain within the
          assigned area.

          5.14.6.2. Aircraft shall contact Columbus Approach on Ch 8 (CBM1) or Ch 18
          (MEI1E) with request and ATIS. Include if desiring recovery to Sunfish, Gunshy or
          Golden Triangle.

          5.14.6.3. If aircraft desires a Runway 13C/31C approach at Columbus, include
          desired request after completion of approach (i.e., Radar, Sunfish, and Full Stop).

     5.14.7. T-6 Surge Areas. T-6 Surge Areas are depicted in Attachment 9.

          5.14.7.1. Prior coordination with RAPCON is required to use the surge areas. The
          surge area will not be available if there is a T-1/ T-38C in sectors 1-6 IAW FAA
          7610.4H.

          5.14.7.2. Area entry. Aircraft shall fly the Bengal profile, expect radar vectors, and
          maintain 7,000 ft.

          5.14.7.3. Recovery. Aircrew shall expect radar vectors on recovery.

5.15. Recovery From Gunshy. Aircraft should expect clearance for the Pickens or Sunfish
Recovery from Meridian approach.

5.16. Lost Communication.

     5.16.1. Lost Communications on the Ground. When communication loss procedures
     require an aircraft to enter or cross an active runway the ATC tower/RSU will ensure the
     operation is safe and any required coordination is completed prior to initiating a light gun
     signal that will allow the aircraft with no radio capabilities to enter the runway.

          5.16.1.1. T-6 aircrew shall alert RSU/ ATC tower by flashing the landing and taxi
          lights. When given a flashing green light by the RSU/ATC tower, aircrew shall
          perform the following:

                5.16.1.1.1. Holding for Runway 31L (Taxiway J), aircraft shall return via
                Taxiway E and return to park.

                5.16.1.1.2. Holding for Runway 13R (Taxiway L), aircraft shall taxi down
                runway 13R and return via normal routing to park.

          5.16.1.2. Holding for Runway 31C/13C, aircraft shall taxi down the Center Runway
          (RWY 13C/31C) and return via Taxiway H to park.
     5.16.1.3. Arriving aircraft to all runways will exit at the end of the runway and
     follow standard taxiing procedures to parking. Aircraft will hold short of all runways
     and monitor RSU/ATC tower for a flashing green light. RSU/ATC tower will issue a
     flashing green light to authorize the aircraft to cross the runway.

     5.16.1.4. Aircrew shall return to the parking area using caution and shall monitor
     ATC tower for additional light signals.

5.16.2. Lost Communication in Tower Airspace. If the aircraft loses communication in
ATC tower airspace prior to receiving landing clearance, aircraft will continue the
approach, squawk 7600, and aircrew will watch the ATC tower for a green light (clearance
to land). If a flashing red light, steady red light or flare is observed, aircraft will execute
the go around/missed approach procedures and follow lost communication procedures.

5.16.3. Lost communication while in RAPCON airspace:

     5.16.3.1. Aircraft shall squawk 7600. If fuel does not permit compliance with FLIP
     or local procedures or if another Emergency exists, squawk Emergency code 7700
     continuously. Expect ATC to attempt contact on GUARD (243.0) or suitable
     NAVAID with instructions. If asked to “squawk fuel”, set pounds of fuel remaining
     in transponder (use 7 for an 8 or 9).

     5.16.3.2. If in the local operating area, VFR can be maintained and VFR pattern is
     open, aircraft shall fly the recovery groundtrack at VFR hemispherical altitudes to the
     appropriate radar termination points.

     5.16.3.3. Canned Profiles. If aircraft is still in RAPCON/ATC tower airspace,
     aircraft shall return and intercept the 13 DME arc and arc for an ILS final to the last
     known active runway. Once established with an outside controlling agency, aircrew
     shall follow the procedures in the Flight Information Handbook.

     5.16.3.4. West MOA (Low Area). If field is IFR, aircraft shall descend and maintain
     7,000' MSL in lateral confines of area, proceed direct CBM 13 DME and arc north or
     east to last assigned runway. Once established on the 13 DME arc, descend and
     maintain 4,000’ and fly an ILS approach to runway 13C/31C.

     5.16.3.5. West MOA (High Area). Aircraft shall descend and maintain 15,000’ MSL
     in lateral confines of area and proceed direct CBM R-293 at 31 DME fix. Once
     aircraft is established on radial, aircraft shall track inbound descending to 7,000’
     MSL. Aircraft shall cross CBM R-293/13 DME at 7,000’ MSL. Aircrew shall
     intercept CBM 13 DME arc, arc north or east to last assigned runway. Once
     established on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’ and fly an ILS approach
     to runway 13C/31C.

     5.16.3.6. South MOA (Low Area). Aircraft shall descend and maintain 7,000’ MSL
     in lateral confines of area, proceed direct CBM 13 DME, arc north or east to last
     assigned runway. Once established on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’
     and fly an ILS approach to runway 13C/31C.

     5.16.3.7. South MOA (High Area). Aircraft shall descend and maintain 15,000’
     MSL in lateral confines of area and proceed direct CBM R-173 at 30 DME fix. Once
     established on radial, aircraft shall track inbound descending to 7,000’ MSL. Aircraft
     shall cross CBM R-173/15 DME at or below 9,000’ MSL. Aircraft shall intercept
     CBM 13 DME arc and arc north or east to last assigned runway. Once established on
     the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’ and fly an ILS approach to runway
     13C/31C.

5.16.4. All aircraft returning to CAFB from the East, not covered above, will intercept
V278, maintain 7,000’. Intercept CBM 13DME, arc to last assigned runway. Once
established on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’ and fly an ILS approach to
runway 13C/31C.

5.16.5. All aircraft returning to CAFB from the West, not covered above, will intercept
V278, maintain 7,000’. Intercept CBM 13DME, arc to last assigned runway. Once
established on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’ and fly an ILS approach to
runway 13C/31C.
Chapter 6

T-38 OPERATIONS

6.1. Flying Status Common to All Airframes.

     6.1.1. Restricted. Weather conditions and/or facilities do not permit full use of training
     areas, VFR patterns or outlying instrument facilities.

     6.1.2. OPS/Weather Recall. Conditions require recovery to CAFB. Coordinate all
     launches with the SOF.

     6.1.3. Area Hold. Conditions prohibit normal aircraft recovery to CAFB. Coordinate all
     launches with the SOF. Refer to paragraph 3.21.2.4.

     6.1.4. Standby. All local flying is suspended for an indefinite period of time until
     conditions improve to support a better status.

     6.1.5. Terminate. Local flying terminated for the remainder of the day.

     6.1.6. Slots. Weather is 300/1. Slots provide the capability to continue local flying
     operations when weather precludes simultaneous T-38C and T-6 recoveries because an IFR
     approach to Runway 13C/31C is required by all aircraft. Plan all approaches to a full stop.
     Aircrew requiring a radar delay or multiple approaches must coordinate approval through
     SUP/Top 3 to the SOF. The squadron SUP/Top 3s will inform the SOF of coordinated slot
     times. Slot times are a landing window. For planning purposes, SUP/Top 3s will plan for
     no more than 1 aircraft to land every 3 minutes. All squadron aircraft must land within the
     agreed upon window. If actual or forecast weather precludes a wing landing, extra time
     must be added for single ship landings. Cross-country launches or out and backs should be
     coordinated with all other squadron SUP/Top 3s and the SOF shall be notified of the plan.

     NOTE: T-38s may launch down to 200’ / 1 mile weather minimums with OG/CC approval.
     The Wing Flying Status may be “standby” but the SOF will coordinate with T-38s on
     launches during this status.

            6.1.6.1. Slot times will be separated by the following times:

                 6.1.6.1.1. Changing from T-6 to T-38C and vice versa - 20 min

            6.1.6.2. When wing flying status is slots, T-1s will coordinate with other squadron
            SUP/Top 3s on their scheduled takeoff and land times.

6.2. T-38C Flying Status.

     6.2.1. Unrestricted. Weather and facilities permit full use of all training areas for dual and
     solo missions.
     6.2.2. Weather Solo. Weather 5,000/5. Solo students will remain clear of clouds or
     maintain weather solo criteria.

     6.2.3. Pattern Solo. Weather 3,300/5. 50th Flight Training Squadron solo students are not
     permitted outside of the VFR pattern. Weather permits VMC pattern operations including
     breakout and re-entry.

     6.2.4. Dual. Weather 2,800/3. No 50th Flight Training Squadron solo sorties permitted.
     Weather permits VMC pattern operations including breakout and re-entry.

     6.2.5. Restricted Overhead. Weather 2,000/3. If ATC tower controls the outside pattern,
     entry from vectors to initial, gate and Runway 13C/31C side-step may be approved, traffic
     permitting. Under Live Oak Procedures, aircraft will enter the pattern from initial takeoff
     or crosswind entry from Runway 13C/31C. Maximum number of aircraft in the RSU
     controlled pattern is eight. No breakouts. Aircrew will carry straight through initial with
     straight-ins between 9 and 4NM. Runway 13C/31C arrivals must full stop or have
     sufficient fuel to return to RAPCON for vectors to another instrument approach.

     6.2.6. VFR Straight-in. Weather 1500/3. If ATC tower controls the outside pattern, entry
     from the gate, low closed and Runway 13C/31C side-step may be approved, traffic
     permitting. Under Live Oak Procedures, aircraft may enter the pattern from initial takeoff,
     low closed, or crosswind entry from Runway 13C/31C. Pattern altitude is 1,200' MSL for
     straight-ins and 800' MSL for low closed. There are no breakouts or normal overheads
     permitted. Maximum aircraft in the pattern is five. T-38Cs will fly the pattern at 300 KIAS
     until 9 miles.

     6.2.7. IFR Recovery. Weather requirements will be either the T-6 circling approach
     minima or 300/1 if T-6s are not flying. T-38Cs recover to Runway 13C/31C. MARSA
     applies IAW para 3.26.

     6.2.8. Weather Solo Criteria. Weather solos may climb/descend through IMC. T-38C
     SUPT SUPs/Top 3s will coordinate with the SOF. IFF Top 3 will determine IFF student
     training restrictions and inform the SOF.

6.3. VFR Traffic Pattern Procedures. UHF shall be the primary frequency used in the
Liveoak pattern. Aircraft shall squawk 0000 while in the VFR pattern.

     6.3.1. When ATC tower controls the pattern, standard FAA communications shall be used
     by aircrew and controllers.

     6.3.2. T-38 Pattern Description. T-38 ground tracks and reporting points are depicted in
     Attachment 5. The overhead pattern is flown at 1,700' MSL and 300 KIAS. When turning
     crosswind, maintain 1,200’ MSL until clear of inside downwind.
          6.3.2.1. Tower Pattern Use. When ATC tower controls the outside runway, the T-38
          pattern for ground tracks and reporting points should be used. Tower may amend the
          pattern as necessary.

     6.3.3. Minimum ceiling for use of the VFR overhead patterns is 500 feet above intended
     pattern altitude.

     6.3.4. On takeoff leg, go-around, or straight through initial, aircraft shall not turn
     crosswind earlier than the departure end of the outside runway.

     6.3.5. VFR Pattern Breakout to Radar. Aircraft will climb to 2,500' MSL at a heading of
     040, contact RAPCON (CH 16) and make a request. (For MOA1 and MOA1 departure
     profiles only)

     6.3.6. Night Procedures. Pattern procedures are the same as during the day except there
     are no practice breakouts between sunset and sunrise. For actual night breakouts, follow
     paragraph 6.3.5.

6.4. Radar Traffic Patterns and Speeds. Radar patterns are depicted in Attachment 11. T-
38C aircraft shall fly a maximum of 300 KIAS in the radar pattern.

6.5. Standard/Local Climb Out. In order to protect the 360 degree overhead pattern when the
weather is VFR (3.7), the standard instrument climb out procedure for runway 13C/31C is, “FLY
RUNWAY HEADING. CROSS DEPARTURE END AT OR BELOW 700’. CLIMB AND
MAINTAIN 4000’. CONTACT DEPARTURE CHANNEL 16.” When the weather is less than
VFR (3.7), "FLY RUNWAY HEADING , CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 4,000’. CONTACT
DEPARTURE CHANNEL 16." RAPCON may abbreviate climb out instructions for local
aircraft by stating, “AFTER COMPLETING LOW APPROACH/TOUCH AND GO/OPTION,
EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT”.

6.6. IFR/VFR Clearances.

     6.6.1. Aircrew will receive their IFR/VFR clearance prior to taxi for all missions that will
     depart ATC tower or RSU controlled airspace. Clearance delivery will issue Class C
     departure instructions, squawk, and a frequency for VFR departures. If an extended delay
     is expected with the clearance, aircrew may taxi and inform Ground Control “AWAITING
     CLEARANCE”. Aircrew will inform Ground Control if encountering a problem with the
     clearance and contact Squadron Ops for assistance.

     NOTE: During Radar Outage procedures clearances will be handled IAW paragraph
     3.21.

     6.6.2. On VFR pattern-only sorties, which do not require an IFR clearance, the aircrew
     will state “PATTERN ONLY” to Ground Control on taxi request.
     6.6.3. Local Night Sortie Clearances. Clearance Delivery assigns the night route and an
     altitude when issuing IFR clearance.

     6.6.4. Multiple Radar Patterns. No more than five local aircraft will be scheduled in the
     radar traffic pattern during multiple radar pattern operations. If the pattern becomes
     saturated with more than five aircraft, RAPCON may direct aircraft to the VFR pattern or
     to full stop.

     6.6.5. IFR/VFR departures from Live Oak. When an aircraft departs IFR from initial
     takeoff or from Live Oak’s pattern, the IFR clearance will be considered activated when the
     aircraft crosses the approach end of the runway (9.5.2). When an aircraft breaks out to
     RADAR from the VFR pattern, the aircraft will be VFR until issued an IFR clearance from
     RAPCON. Aircraft are responsible for separation between themselves and other aircraft
     within a practice area. RAPCON assumes separation responsibility when an aircraft clears
     the lateral/vertical boundary of the appropriate practice area. To comply with Columbus
     AFB Class C airspace, aircrew must establish two-way radio communication with
     RAPCON prior to leaving a practice area. (For example, "SNAKE 21, standby" is
     clearance to depart the practice area, whereas, "Aircraft calling departure, standby" is not.)
     If unable, remain inside the practice area and return to the pattern. Another departure from
     the pattern may be attempted. If for any reason (separation, workload, etc.) the RAPCON
     states return to the practice area (Live Oak), remain inside the practice area and contact the
     appropriate RSU.

     6.6.6. Canceling IFR/Flight Following. To reduce verbiage, RAPCON may acknowledge
     14 FTW aircraft canceling IFR or flight following with “C/S, ROGER”. Aircrew will
     understand that radar service is terminated, will squawk stand-by or the appropriate code.

     6.6.7. IFR Recovery/Slots Status. Prior to departing on either status, aircrew must receive
     an IFR clearance. The IFR clearance is effective once cleared for takeoff by the ATC
     tower.

6.7. Departures.

     6.7.1. Deleted

     6.7.2. General. Aircrew shall maintain at or below 700' MSL until departure end of the
     runway during VFR weather (3.7).

     6.7.3. Trail Departures.

          6.7.3.1 Formations must be rejoined to standard formation prior to leaving Columbus
          airspace or coordinate for separate clearances.

          6.7.3.2. Aircrew shall include “C/S, NON STANDARD, TRAIL DEPARTURE,
          <approximate range from the beginning of the flight to the end> FRONT to BACK”
          when requesting takeoff. If two flights are MARSA, Clearance Delivery will issue
          the squawks for both flights and one clearance for the combined flight.

          6.7.3.3. The lead aircraft will squawk ATC assigned code. Each trailing aircraft in a
          nonstandard formation will squawk 0400 until standard formation.

          6.7.3.4. Once airborne, the lead aircraft will call “C/S, airborne, out of X (altitude)
          for Y (final altitude), NON STANDARD, TRAIL DEPARTURE”. If MARSA,
          aircrew shall use both flights’ C/Ss on initial contact with each ATC agency (i.e.,
          Snake MARSA Gundog).


6.8. Radar Termination Points.

     6.8.1. Aircraft shall descend no lower than the Minimum Vectoring Altitude (Attachment
     22) until cancelling IFR.

     6.8.2. Aircraft shall make every effort to avoid over-flying populated areas at low altitude
     and advise RAPCON of deviations.

     6.8.3. All aircrew will monitor RAPCON and squawk assigned code until within 3 miles
     of the radar termination point (IFR or VFR). RAPCON may continue to provide vectors
     after the aircrew has cancelled IFR to aid in separation between other aircraft on recovery.
     Aircrew shall comply with these vectors until the conflict is resolved either by visual
     contact or other means.

     6.8.4. When approaching the radar termination point and able to proceed VFR, aircraft
     shall cancel IFR with RAPCON. RAPCON will respond with “ROGER” meaning radar
     service is terminated, squawk 0000.

     6.8.5. Aircraft shall remain outside 10 DME until reaching the radar termination point.
     Aircrew shall change to Live Oak/ATC tower and report the gate. Aircrew are expected to
     cancel IFR no later than 3 miles prior to radar termination. If unable to cancel IFR due to
     frequency congestion, aircraft will squawk 0000 (meaning “Cancel IFR”) and contact Live
     Oak/ATC tower.

6.9. Live Oak Pattern Entry.

     6.9.1. Live Oak may be entered via: Initial takeoff from Live Oak, North/South Gate
     entries, crosswind/closed from the center runway.

     6.9.2. Live Oak Entry Points. North gate is the primary point of entry to Live Oak’s
     pattern for runway 13L. North gate is a highway interchange shaped like a cloverleaf
     located at CBM 348/011. South gate is the primary point of entry to Live Oak’s pattern for
     runway 31R. South gate is the southeast edge of a large power plant located at CBM
     086/009.
     6.9.3. North/South Gate Entry Procedures. The status must be at least Dual to accomplish
     gate entries when Live Oak is controlling the outside runway. The gate entry points are
     also used to re-enter the pattern following a breakout. If on an IFR clearance and
     proceeding direct to north/south gate, aircrew must cancel IFR on their own prior to
     switching to Live Oak’s frequency.

           6.9.3.1. With the exception of emergencies and aircraft accomplishing runway
           change procedures, aircraft shall not make a north/south gate entry between runway
           change time and 10 minutes past runway change time.

     6.9.4. Center Runway. When the status is Restricted Overhead or VFR straight-ins,
     aircraft on departure leg will contact Live Oak, when instructed, for pattern entry.

           6.9.4.1. If closed/crosswind entry is denied, aircrew shall maintain VFR and
           accomplish one of the following: Contact RAPCON (Ch 16) for vectors to another
           approach or climb to 2,500’ MSL on runway heading (Dual+), then turn toward the
           appropriate gate entry point, notifying controller of intentions “TRANSITION TO
           NORTH/SOUTH GATE.”

6.10. Radar Vector to Initial Procedures.

     6.10.1. Radar vectors to initial may be conducted at anytime the ATC tower has
     operational control of the center and outside and/or inside runways, traffic permitting.

     6.10.2. Aircrew shall request the overhead approach on initial contact with RAPCON or
     prior to reaching 15 flying miles from the runway. Aircrew shall report, “COLUMBUS
     APPROACH, (CALL SIGN), 20 MILES SOUTHEAST WITH (ATIS), REQUESTING
     OVERHEAD (TYPE LANDING)”.

     6.10.3. When requesting radar vectors to initial, aircraft shall normally be vectored to a 10-
     mile final. The aircraft’s IFR flight plan is automatically cancelled at 10 miles.

6.11. Tactical/High Tactical Initial. All 14 FTW aircraft may fly Tactical/High Tactical
initial in accordance with their MDS series regulations and the following guidance.
Tactical/High Tactical initial will only be available for use when tower is controlling at a
minimum 13/31C and 13L/31R simultaneously, with a Dual status or better. Tactical/High
Tactical initial may be flown in 2, 3 or 4 ship formation.

     6.11.1. Tactical Initial

           6.11.1.1. Pilots will request “Tac Initial” on first contact with RAPCON. Approval
           for tactical initial is through ATC tower

           6.11.1.2. ( T-1 N/A) When tower approves tactical initial flight leads will line up east
           of 13L/31R but not to be a conflict with inside downwind (lineup with tree line east
           of 13L/31R) and wingmen will lineup no further West than 13C/31C in spread line-
         abreast; this will provide approximately 3000’ spacing between aircraft. If in a 3-ship,
         the trailing aircraft will line up between the leading element, approx 6,000 feet in
         trail. If in a 4-ship, the formation will be a container (not offset), with the trailing
         element approx 6,000 feet behind the leading element.

         6.11.1.3. Add “for Tac Initial” with first radio call to Tower and report “5 mile Tac
         Initial” at the 5NM from the runway.


         6.11.1.4. ( T-1 N/A) In the break zone, the element will perform an in-place 90
         degree turn towards inside downwind (045º heading). The flight lead(s) will continue
         the turn to roll out on the normal inside downwind ground track. The wingmen will
         roll out after 90 degrees of turn, 045º heading, and delay their next turn to roll out on
         inside downwind, behind their flight leads on the normal inside downwind ground
         track. If in a 3 or 4-ship formation, the trailing element will delay their turn until the
         preceding element is clear of the formation and minimum spacing IAW AFI 11-2T-38
         Vol. 3 can be attained. If told to “carry straight thru”, flight lead(s) may rejoin flight
         or remain in tactical and re-request tac initial on outside downwind.

         6.11.1.5. Tac Initial may be flown at out bases if approved by tower using procedures
         outlined in AFI 11-2T-38V3.

    6.11.2. High Tactical Initial

         6.11.2.1. Pilots will request “HI-Tac Initial” on first contact with RAPCON.
         Approval for high tactical initial is through ATC tower.

         6.11.2.2. When tower approves high tactical initial flight leads will line up East of
         13L/31R (line-up with tree line East of 13L/31R) and wingmen will line-up no further
         West than RWY 13C/31C in spread line-abreast; this will provide approximately
         3,000’ spacing between aircraft.

         6.11.2.3. Add “for Hi-Tac Initial” with first radio call to Tower and report “5 mile
         Hi-Tac Initial” at 5NM from the runway.

         6.11.2.4. At departure end of runway, break to enter downwind at 1,700’. If told to
         “carry straight thru”, maintain 3,500’, report standard formation and make request.

6.12. Center Runway Arrival Procedures.

    6.12.1. Contact Straight-In Approach. Aircrew shall declare “CONTACT” with RAPCON
    prior to 10 DME, but not prior to base leg. After RAPCON approves the approach, aircrew
    shall maintain 2,000’ MSL until intercepting a visual glide path. Runway centerline will be
    established prior to 10 DME and maintained to the runway.
    6.12.2. The ATC tower will direct all frequency changes to departure/arrival. When the
    aircrew requests to stay with the ATC tower in the VFR pattern, IFR clearance is
    terminated after crossing the runway threshold on IFR approaches.

6.13. Drag Procedures.

    6.13.1. The Drag procedure allows a formation to achieve nonstandard formation spacing
    on final. The trailing aircraft gains separation by reducing airspeed and shall squawk 0400.
    Aircraft are still treated as a single formation by ATC, and communications are directed to
    the lead aircraft. However, each aircraft in the formation shall call gear down.

    6.13.2. The lead aircraft will request the drag procedure upon initial call to ATC. Aircraft
    shall accomplish the drag and approach in daytime, during VMC conditions.

    6.13.3. The flight is considered a non-standard formation throughout the drag procedure.
    Each aircraft will confirm and call gear down at the Final Approach Fix.6.13.4. If landing
    clearance is canceled, both aircraft shall fly runway heading until turning crosswind or, if
    IMC, lead shall climb to 4,000' MSL and the wingman shall climb to 3,000' MSL following
    standard climb out instructions until separate clearances are obtained.

6.14. Split-to-Land Approach Procedures.

    6.14.1. Split-to-land maneuvers are authorized for all 14 FTW aircraft. Aircrew and ATC
    may request a split-to-land maneuver for more expeditious recoveries.

    6.14.2. Weather conditions for split-to-land maneuvers must be at or above the sidestep
    minimums for the approach being flown. In the absence of sidestep minimums, circling
    minimums will be used.

    6.14.3. ATC tower must have control of all of the runways involved.

    6.14.4. In order to request a split-to-land maneuver, a aircrew must either:

         6.14.4.1. Advise RAPCON of request for split-to-land maneuver and state type of
         landing when requesting an approach prior to 10 miles. RAPCON shall contact ATC
         tower local controller for approval to allow a split-to-land maneuver.

         6.14.4.2. Aircrew shall request a split-to-land maneuver with ATC tower prior to the
         Final Approach Fix.

    6.14.5. Split-to-land maneuvers may be executed off all approaches and will commence no
    earlier than the FAF. Flight lead shall advise ATC when commencing the split-to-land
    maneuver. Aircrew shall maintain their own separation during the split-to-land maneuver.
     NOTE: When controlling other aircraft in conjunction with a flight which will execute a
     split-to-land, the rule is, the flight which has been cleared for a split-to-land “OWNS” both
     runways until the last element lands.

     6.14.6. Split-to-Land maneuvers shall terminate in a full stop. If unable to full stop, VFR
     aircraft shall maintain VFR and contact ATC tower. IFR aircraft shall execute climb out or
     proceed as directed by RAPCON. Aircrew shall maintain their own separation upon
     missed approach and until standard separation is achieved.

6.15. T-38C MOA Procedures. MOA procedures common to all airframes are located in
section 3.25.

     6.15.1. Priorities. If an aircraft is airborne and assigned airspace is not available, CBM
     RAPCON will advise the aircrew. The aircrew will then state their intentions (i.e.,
     continue departure, return to Live Oak/ATC tower airspace.) CBM RAPCON will
     typically not assign sectors not specifically requested by the aircrew.

     6.15.2. North Areas. T-1, T-38 SUPT and IFF squadrons will finalize sector(s).

          6.15.2.1. Once established in a sector, T-38Cs shall automatically switch to Area
          Monitor (Ch 8) and report established.

          6.15.2.2. T-38Cs should expect a block of 8,000-22,000.

          6.15.2.3. North Area Recoveries.

                6.15.2.3.1. Sectors 1-6. Aircrew will contact RAPCON (CH 7) and request
                vectors for desired recovery.

                6.15.2.3.2. VFR Recoveries. The North/South gate recoveries are CAFB VFR
                arrival procedures that require RAPCON coordination. North/South gate entries
                must cancel IFR NLT 3NM prior to the gate. If unable to contact ATC due to
                frequency congestion by 3NM, squawk 0000 to indicate IFR cancellation and
                contact Live Oak.

                6.15.2.3.3. Direct North/South Gate entry. Aircraft will fly at or below 7,000'
                MSL prior to departing the lateral boundaries of ATC assigned area, unless
                otherwise coordinated. North gate is the primary point of entry to the pattern
                for runway 13 and is located at CBM 348/011. South gate is the primary entry
                point to the pattern for runway 31 and is located at CBM 086/009. The first
                aircraft to arrive at the gate has the right-of-way. Aircraft will fly a heading of
                220 at 300 KIAS at 1,700' MSL and report to the ATC tower when one mile
                from the gate with intentions when under ATC tower control. Straight-in
                approaches may be requested at this point if desired.

     6.15.3. CBM3 (West) MOA.
     6.15.3.1. Aircrew will receive their area assignment from Memphis Center (Ch 5).

     6.15.3.2. Aircrew shall switch to discrete frequency (CH 6) when directed.

     6.15.3.3. West MOA Recoveries. CBM 3 MOA/ATCAA is controlled by Memphis
     ARTCC (CH 5). Aircrews will use Winona (IGB 266/50), EGUPT or Houston IFR
     recoveries to return to CAFB.

           6.15.3.3.1. Winona Recovery. Depart the lateral confines of the assigned
           sector(s) at 15,000’ and proceed direct TOMLN direct IGB direct CBM. If
           requested, aircrew may execute the recovery at FL 230 in order to accomplish
           the High ILS Approach at CBM. Aircrew can expect direct to KOBRE when
           transferred to CBM RAPCON.

           6.15.3.3.2. EGUPT Recovery. Remain within lateral confines of assigned
           sector until at 7,000’ MSL or center assigned altitude. Intercept the CBM R-
           314 outside 45 DME and track the CBM R-314 inbound.

           6.15.3.3.3. Houston Recovery. Remain within lateral confines of assigned
           sector until at 7,000’ MSL or center assigned altitude. Proceed direct to
           Houston (CBM 297/42). Be at 5,000’ MSL by Houston, and upon reaching
           Houston fly heading 090, expect radar vectors.

6.15.4. CBM2 (Echo) MOA.

     6.15.4.1. Memphis (Ch 17) will clear aircraft into the MOA/ATCAA. Aircraft will
     remain on this discrete frequency.

     6.15.4.2. Echo MOA Recovery. Aircraft shall request “Echo Recovery” from
     Memphis Center. Memphis Center issues an abbreviated clearance for an Echo
     recovery “(CALL SIGN), CLEARED ECHO RECOVERY, MAINTAIN
     (ALTITUDE).” Aircraft shall remain in the area until at 14,000’ MSL or Center
     assigned altitude, and then proceed direct KOBRE, CBM. Aircraft should expect
     radar vectors at KOBRE.

6.15.5. BHM 1/2 MOA. Aircrew must schedule with the Montgomery Air National Guard
(ANG) (DSN 358-9255) at least 1 hour prior to use. If area time is prior to 0700L, aircrew
shall notify the ANG the day prior. On Mondays or ANG down days, aircrew shall
schedule through Atlanta.

     6.15.5.1. Atlanta Center (297.4) will clear aircraft into the area. Aircrew shall switch
     to discrete frequency (normally 252.9) when directed.

     6.15.5.2. Center may assign the entire MOA, including MOA 2, (500' AGL to
     FL230). Aircrew shall clarify altitude block and apply training rules.
         6.15.5.3. When entering the MOA, aircrew shall advise center of estimated time of
         departure. Wingmen shall squawk the first two digits of the Flight Lead's IFF code
         plus 00. Lead and number three shall squawk during 4-ship operations.

         6.15.5.4. BHM 1/2 MOA Recovery. Aircrew shall request recovery from Atlanta.

    6.15.6. R-4404 (SeaRay) Restricted Area. Meridian Approach (Ch 25) will clear aircraft
    into the restricted area. 14 FTW aircraft will utilize the Range Control Officer frequency
    (Ch 26) in the area.

         6.15.6.1. R-4404 “Smurf Recovery”. Prior to exiting the restricted area, remain
         VMC between 4,000’ and 6,000’ and obtain clearance from Meridian RATCF.
         Expect to be cleared to Columbus AFB via direct IGB VORTAC via the IGB 199
         radial, direct CBM VORTAC, direct Columbus AFB maintaining 5,000’ or as
         assigned. Expect radar vectors.

    6.15.7. T-38C Surge Areas. T-38C surge areas are depicted in Attachment 9. T-38C surge
    areas are Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie. Areas are controlled by RAPCON. Aircrew may
    expect 8,000' MSL to FL220. The Surge Areas are only used on a noninterference basis
    with T-6 operations. Top 3/SUPs will coordinate use with Texan Ops.

    6.15.8. Other Recoveries. If an aircraft is monitoring a discrete frequency, aircrew will
    return to the previously assigned frequency for recovery. On initial contact with CAFB
    RAPCON, aircraft will state desired recovery/approach option (Initial, north/south gate,
    Instrument/Contact Approach) and current ATIS information. For Runway 13C/31C
    approaches, aircraft shall indicate how the approach will terminate (e.g., full stop, option
    live oak, etc.). Aircraft shall utilize a single radio call when practical to reduce radio
    congestion. On all recoveries, aircraft shall maintain their altitude until ATC assigns a
    vector. Upon entering the pattern, aircraft will follow procedures detailed in paragraph 6.3.

    6.15.9. VFR Arrivals. During recovery, aircraft shall contact Columbus Approach at
    approximately 30NM for radar advisory service and runway approach clearance.

6.16. Lost Communication.

    6.16.1. Lost Communications on the Ground. When communication loss procedures
    require an aircraft to enter or cross an active runway the ATC tower/RSU will ensure the
    operation is safe and any required coordination is completed prior to initiating a light gun
    signal that will allow the aircraft with no radio capabilities to enter the runway.

         6.16.1.1. Holding for Runway 31C. Aircrew shall hold in the hammerhead and flash
         the taxi light at the RSU/ATC tower. T-38C may also raise and lower the canopy.
         The ATC tower will flash a green light at the aircraft when cleared to taxi via
         Taxiway F to park. Aircrews will then taxi forward of the run-up area, turn left and
         proceed to the parking area against traffic. Ground Control will issue “give way”
         instruction to outbound traffic to mitigate conflicts.
     6.16.1.2. Holding for Runway 13C. Aircrew shall hold in the hammerhead and flash
     the taxi light at the RSU/ATC tower. T-38C may also raise and lower the canopy.
     After receiving a flashing green light from the ATC tower, taxi down the runway and
     turn off at Taxiway H and return to park.

     6.16.1.3. Holding for Runway 13L. Aircrew shall hold short of the runway and flash
     the taxi light at the RSU/ATC tower. T-38C may also raise and lower the canopy.
     After receiving a flashing green light from the RSU/ATC tower, the aircraft shall taxi
     down the runway and exit at the end. The aircraft will then hold short of runway 13C
     and shall accomplish the alerting signal to obtain approval from the ATC tower to
     cross the runway. The ATC tower shall again issue a flashing green to allow the
     aircraft to continue taxing across Runway 13C. Once the aircraft has exited Runway
     13C it will taxi to park.

     6.16.1.4. Holding for Runway 31R Aircrew shall hold short of the runway and flash
     the taxi light at the RSU/ATC tower. T-38C may also raise and lower the canopy.
     After receiving a flashing green light from the RSU/ATC tower, the aircraft shall taxi
     down the runway and exit at the end. The aircraft will then hold short of runway 31C
     and accomplish the alerting signal to obtain approval from the ATC tower to cross the
     runway. The ATC tower shall issue a flashing green to allow the aircraft to continue
     taxing across Runway 31C. Once the aircraft has exited Runway 31C it will hold
     short of runway 31L and accomplish the alerting signal to obtain approval from the
     RSU/ATC tower to cross the runway. The RSU/ATC tower shall issue a flashing
     green to allow the aircraft to continue taxing across Runway 31L. Once the aircraft
     has exited Runway 31L it will taxi to park.

     6.16.1.5. Arriving aircraft to all runways will exit at the end of the runway and
     follow standard taxiing procedures to parking. Aircraft will hold short of all runways
     and monitor RSU/ATC tower for a flashing green light. RSU/ATC tower will issue a
     flashing green light to authorize the aircraft to cross the runway.

     6.16.1.6. Aircrew shall return to the parking area using caution and shall monitor
     ATC tower for additional light signals.

6.16.2. Lost Communications in Tower Airspace. If the aircraft loses communication in
ATC tower airspace prior to receiving landing clearance, aircraft will continue the
approach, squawk 7600, and aircrew will watch the ATC tower for a green light (clearance
to land). If a flashing red light, steady red light or flare is observed, aircraft will execute
the go around/missed approach procedures and follow lost communication procedures.

6.16.3. Lost Communications while in RAPCON Airspace:

     6.16.3.1. Aircraft shall squawk IFF code 7600. If fuel does not permit compliance
     with FLIP or local procedures or if another emergency exists, squawk emergency
     code 7700 continuously. Expect ATC to attempt contact on GUARD (243.0) or
     suitable NAVAID with instructions. If asked to “squawk fuel”, set pounds of fuel
     remaining in transponder (use 7 for an 8 or 9).

     6.16.3.2. Outside local area, comply with FLIP procedures.

     6.16.3.3. North Areas. Aircraft shall descend and maintain 7,000’ in lateral confines
     of area, proceed direct CBM 13DME and arc east or west to last assigned runway.
     Once established on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’ for an ILS
     approach to runway 13C/31C.

           6.16.3.3.1. Sector 6. Columbus RAPCON does not own 7,000’ in the vicinity
           of Tupelo. Aircraft shall descend to 8,000’ and proceed to CBM 330 radial (not
           entering Sector 4). Upon intercepting CBM 330 radial inbound, descend and
           maintain 7,000’, intercept CBM 13 DME arc and arc east or west to last
           assigned runway. Once established on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain
           4,000’ for an ILS approach to runway 13C/31C.

     6.16.3.4. CBM3 (West) MOA. Aircraft shall climb to FL 230 in the lateral confines
     of the area and proceed direct KOBRE. Execute the High ILS approach to the last
     assigned runway.

     6.16.3.5. CBM2 (Echo) MOA. Aircraft shall proceed direct KOBRE at FL 230 and
     execute the High ILS approach to the last assigned runway.

6.16.4. All aircraft returning to CAFB from the East, not covered above, will intercept
V278, maintain 7,000’. Intercept CBM 13DME, arc to last assigned runway. Once
established on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’ for an ILS approach to
runway 13C/31C.

6.16.5. All aircraft returning to CAFB from the West, not covered above, will intercept
V278, maintain 7,000’. Intercept CBM 13DME, arc to last assigned runway. Once
established on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’ for an ILS approach to
runway 13C/31C.

6.16.6. Lost Communication While Flying Drag Approach.

     6.16.6.1. If the lead aircraft loses communications prior to receiving landing
     clearance, aircrew shall continue the approach, squawk 7600, and observe the ATC
     tower for a green light. If the aircrew observes a red light or flare, aircrew shall
     execute the go around/missed approach procedures and follow lost communications
     procedures.

     6.16.6.2. If the trailing aircraft loses communications, aircrew shall squawk 7600,
     follow the lead aircraft and land (if sufficient spacing exists and no red light/flares are
     observed). If a go around is required, aircrew shall execute the go around/missed
     approach procedures and follow lost communications procedures.
Chapter 7

T-1 OPERATIONS

7.1. Flying Status Common to All Airframes.

     7.1.1. Restricted. Weather conditions and/or facilities do not permit full use of training
     areas, VFR patterns or outlying instrument facilities.

     7.1.2. OPS/Weather Recall. Conditions require recovery to CAFB. Coordinate all
     launches with the SOF.

     7.1.3. Area Hold. Conditions prohibit normal aircraft recovery to CAFB. Coordinate all
     launches with the SOF. Refer to paragraph 3.21.2.4.

     7.1.4. Standby. All local flying is suspended for an indefinite period of time until
     conditions support a better status.

     7.1.5. Terminate. Local flying terminated for the remainder of the day.

     7.1.6. Slots. Weather is 300/1. Slots provide the capability to continue local flying
     operations when weather precludes simultaneous T-38C and T-6 recoveries because an IFR
     approach to Runway 13C/31C is required by all aircraft. Plan all approaches to a full stop.
     Aircrew requiring a radar delay or multiple approaches must coordinate approval through
     SUP/Top 3 to the SOF. The squadron SUP/Top 3s will inform the SOF of coordinated slot
     times. Slot times are a landing window. For planning purposes, SUP/Top 3s will plan for
     no more than 1 aircraft to land every 3 minutes. All squadron aircraft must land within the
     agreed upon window. If actual or forecast weather precludes a wing landing, extra time
     must be added for single ship landings. Cross-country launches or out and backs should be
     coordinated with all other squadron SUP/Top 3s and the SOF shall be notified of the plan.

     NOTE: T-1s may launch down to 200’ / ½ mile weather minimums. The Wing Flying
     Status may be “standby” but the SOF will coordinate with T-1s on launches during this
     status.

            7.1.6.1. Slot times will be separated by the following times:

                 7.1.6.1.1. Changing from T-6 to T-38C and vice versa - 20 min

            7.1.6.2. When wing flying status is slots, T-1s will coordinate with other squadron
            SUP/Top 3s on their scheduled takeoff and land times.

7.2. T-1 Flying Status.

     7.2.1. Unrestricted. Weather or facility status does not require an alternate for the home
     field.
     7.2.2. Restricted Overhead. Weather 1,500/3. Aircraft will enter the VFR pattern via
     initial takeoff or closed/crosswind from the center runway. ATC tower may approve
     entries from initial, side-step, and North/South Gate, traffic permitting. No VFR breakouts.
     Runway 13C/31C arrivals must full stop or have sufficient fuel to return to RAPCON for
     vectors to another instrument approach.

     7.2.3. IFR Recovery. If other wing aircraft are operating under Slots status, T-1s will plan
     all approaches to a full stop. Departures will be made in accordance with published
     weather minimums. Aircraft are MARSA IAW para 3.26.

     7.2.4. Weather Alert. Coordinate all launches with the SOF. Weather conditions may
     impede recovery to CAFB. Contact the SUP. T-1s with enough fuel to continue their
     profile with divert fuel or on an out-and-back may continue with SUP approval.

7.3. VFR Traffic Pattern Procedures. UHF shall be the primary frequency used in the
pattern. Aircraft shall squawk 0000 while in the VFR pattern.

     7.3.1. When ATC tower controls the pattern, standard FAA communications shall be used
     by aircrew and controllers.

     7.3.2. Control. The ATC tower will operate a normal FAA pattern when Live Oak is not
     in place. T-1 aircrews should follow the normal outside downwind and VFR entry
     groundtracks when able.

     7.3.3. Minimum ceiling for use of the VFR overhead patterns is 500 feet above intended
     pattern altitude.

     7.3.4. Aircrews are required to repeat all ATC tower clearances including the specified
     runway. Examples of these clearances include takeoff, landing, traffic advisory, pattern
     extension, ATC tower directed breakout and ATC tower directed go-around.

     7.3.5. Aircrews will state “(CALL SIGN), REQUEST CLOSED” for a 1,500’ AGL pattern
     or "(CALL SIGN), REQUEST CLOSED, 1,000' AGL" for a 1,000' AGL pattern.

     7.3.6. T-1 Pattern Description. Pattern Altitudes. The T-1 VFR pattern will normally be
     flown at 1,500’ AGL with the option of flying 1,000' AGL patterns if requested by aircrew.
     Outside downwind should be flown at 1,700’ MSL (When turning crosswind, maintain
     1,200’ MSL until clear of inside downwind). (NOTE: T-1s will normally recover to a full
     stop landing when the outside runway is RSU controlled). When the ATC tower controls
     the outside runway, T-1s may conduct local pattern operations (200 KIAS minimum is
     recommended in the downwind pattern).

     7.3.7. Initial Takeoff from the center or outside runway. When taking off on the center
     runway for a VFR delay, aircrew shall request closed or crosswind from the ATC tower. If
     turning crosswind, the aircrew shall remain at or below 1,200’ MSL until clear of the inside
     downwind track, then shall climb to pattern altitude (1,700’ MSL). Aircrew shall squawk
     0000 until departing on IFR clearance unless the ATC tower directs otherwise. To depart
     the VFR pattern on an IFR clearance, aircrew will obtain IFR clearance prior to takeoff
     when able. If unable, aircrew shall place clearance on request at least 10 minutes prior to
     departure to prevent delays.

     7.3.8. Entering the Pattern from north/south gate. North gate is the primary point of entry
     to the pattern for runway 13 and is located at CBM 348/011. South gate is the primary
     entry point to the pattern for runway 31 and is located at CBM 086/009. The first aircraft
     to arrive at the gate will have right-of-way. Aircraft will fly a heading of 220 at 200 KIAS
     at 1,700' MSL and report to the ATC tower when one mile from the gate with intentions.
     Straight-in approaches may be requested at this point if desired.

     7.3.9. Straight-In from North/South Gate. Aircraft will report “NORTH/SOUTH GATE
     REQUEST STRAIGHT IN.” For North Gate entries, aircrew shall make a "C/S XX,
     POND" call once over the north tip of the catfish ponds. For South Gate entries, aircrew
     shall make a "C/S XX, POND" call abeam a Y-shaped pond 2NM south of the electric
     station (not the South Gate plant), which will be on the right side of the aircraft. If
     approved, aircraft descend to 1,200' MSL and slow to 180 KIAS as soon as practical.
     Aircraft will report “4 MILES” with gear configuration. If unable to grant approval or any
     delay is encountered, aircraft will maintain 200 KIAS and 1,700' MSL and continue to
     initial.

     7.3.10. Emergencies. Aircraft returning to the ATC tower pattern with an emergency will
     notify the ATC tower as soon as possible after RAPCON hand-off. If aircraft need to
     analyze a problem (burn down fuel, etc.) the ATC tower controller may reserve an altitude
     or block at or above 2,700’ MSL. Emergency aircraft should follow the normal pattern
     groundtrack at the requested altitude. If unable, advise the ATC tower controller.

     7.3.11. Formations in the VFR Pattern. At the break point in the pattern, formation flights
     will split-up and continue their approaches as single ships. If a formation must pass the
     break point and fly straight through, formations will split-up past the departure end and turn
     into the crosswind pattern.

     7.3.12. VFR Pattern Breakout to Radar. Aircraft will climb to 2,500' MSL at a heading of
     040, contact RAPCON (Ch 16) and make a request.

     7.3.13. Night Procedures. Pattern procedures are the same as during the day except there
     are no practice breakouts between sunset and sunrise. For actual night breakouts, follow
     paragraph 7.3.12. Aircraft will NOT re-enter the pattern at north/south gate.

7.4. Radar Traffic Patterns and Speeds. Radar patterns are depicted in Attachment 11. T-1
Aircraft shall fly 250 KIAS on RADAR downwind and base. Aircraft shall maintain 250 KIAS
until on final approach and inside 13 DME. If being vectored on base inside 13 DME, aircraft
should begin slowing from 250 KIAS at 13 miles from touchdown. Aircraft shall maintain 180
KIAS until inside 9 DME.
7.5. Standard/Local Climb Out. In order to protect the 360 degree overhead pattern when the
weather is VFR (3.7), the standard instrument climb out procedure for runway 13C/31C is,
“FLY RUNWAY HEADING. CROSS DEPARTURE END AT OR BELOW 700’. CLIMB
AND MAINTAIN 4000’. CONTACT DEPARTURE CHANNEL 16.” When the weather is
less than VFR (3.7), "FLY RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 4,000’.
CONTACT DEPARTURE CHANNEL 16." RAPCON may abbreviate climb out instructions
for local aircraft by stating, “AFTER COMPLETING LOW APPROACH/TOUCH AND
GO/OPTION, EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT”.

7.6. IFR/VFR Clearances.

     7.6.1. Aircrew will receive IFR/VFR clearance prior to taxi for all missions that will depart
     ATC tower or RSU controlled airspace. Clearance delivery will issue Class C departure
     instructions, squawk, and a frequency for VFR departures. If an extended delay is expected
     with the clearance, aircrew may taxi and inform Ground Control “AWAITING
     CLEARANCE”. Aircrew will inform Ground Control if encountering a problem with the
     clearance and contact Squadron Ops for assistance.

     7.6.2. On VFR pattern-only sorties, which do not require an IFR clearance, the aircrew
     will state “PATTERN ONLY” to Ground Control on taxi request.

     7.6.3. Local Night Sortie Clearances. Clearance Delivery assigns the night route and an
     altitude when issuing IFR clearance.

     7.6.4. Multiple Radar Patterns. No more than five local aircraft will be scheduled in the
     radar traffic pattern during multiple radar pattern operations. If the pattern becomes
     saturated with more than five aircraft, RAPCON may direct aircraft to the VFR pattern or
     to full stop.

     7.6.5. IFR/VFR departures from Live Oak. When an aircraft departs IFR from initial
     takeoff or from Live Oak’s pattern, the IFR clearance will be considered activated when the
     aircraft crosses the approach end of the runway (9.5.2). When an aircraft breaks out to
     RADAR from the VFR pattern, the aircraft will be VFR until issued an IFR clearance from
     RAPCON. Aircraft are responsible for separation between themselves and other aircraft
     within a practice area. RAPCON assumes separation responsibility when an aircraft clears
     the lateral/vertical boundary of the appropriate practice area. To comply with Columbus
     AFB Class C airspace, aircrew must establish two-way radio communication with
     RAPCON prior to leaving a practice area. (For example, "SNAKE 21, standby" is
     clearance to depart the practice area, whereas, "Aircraft calling departure, standby" is not.)
     If unable, remain inside the practice area and return to the pattern. Another departure from
     the pattern may be attempted. If for any reason (separation, workload, etc.) the RAPCON
     states return to the practice area (Live Oak), remain inside the practice area and contact the
     appropriate RSU.
     7.6.6. Canceling IFR/Flight Following. To reduce verbiage, RAPCON may acknowledge
     14 FTW aircraft canceling IFR or flight following with “C/S, ROGER”. Aircrew will
     understand that radar service is terminated, will squawk stand-by or the appropriate code.

     7.6.7. IFR Recovery/Slots Status. Prior to departing on either status, aircrew must receive
     an IFR clearance. The IFR clearance is effective once cleared for takeoff by the ATC
     tower.

7.7. Departures.

     7.7.1. Deleted

     7.7.2. Center Runway Procedures. Normal T-1 departures are via the center runway. T-1
     aircraft may utilize intersection takeoffs from H (Rwy 31C) if coordinated through Ground
     Control.

     NOTE: If the weather is greater than or equal to 1500’-3, cross the departure end at or
     below 700’.

     7.7.3. Outside Runway. ATC tower will control T-1 launches on the outside under normal
     operations. T-1s should not plan to takeoff on the outside runway when Live Oak has
     control. Aircraft shall not stagger on the taxiway. If the preflight requires an engine run-up
     for engine/wing anti-icing checks, aircrew shall perform these checks in the center runway
     hammerhead before taxiing to the outside runway.

     NOTE: If the weather is greater than or equal to 1500’-3, cross the departure end at or
     below 700’.

     7.7.4. Rolling Takeoffs. If a rolling takeoff is desired, aircrew shall add “ROLLING” to
     the ready for takeoff call.

     7.7.5. Formation Departures. Aircrew may fly a delay up to 1 minute and add “15
     SECOND (OR 1 MINUTE) INTERVAL” to the end of the ready for takeoff call and any
     subsequent calls to ATC until back in standard formation.

     7.7.6. T-1 aircraft should fly local departures at 220 KIAS until level.

     7.7.7. Formation Departures. Formation flights that require a one-minute interval will
     obtain separate squawks from clearance delivery and will be a nonstandard formation until
     rejoined. The lead aircraft will squawk the formation assigned code. The second aircraft in
     the formation will squawk 0400 until rejoined as a standard formation.

     7.7.8. ATC tower will treat the formation as a flight and will clear both aircraft for takeoff
     as a flight.

     7.7.9. Flights will rejoin to standard formation prior to leaving Columbus airspace. Centers
     will not accept nonstandard formations. Aircraft shall inform RAPCON when standard
     ATC formation is achieved.

     7.7.10. If on the ground and the aircrew determines that weather will prevent a rejoin prior
     to Memphis Center airspace, both aircraft will takeoff single-ship (separate clearances) and
     rejoin in the MOA or at the low-level entry point.

     7.7.11. Once airborne, if the aircrew determines that weather will prevent a rejoin prior to
     Memphis Center airspace, the aircrew will advise RAPCON as soon as possible and
     request altitude separation. Each aircraft can expect to squawk individual assigned codes
     given by clearance delivery.

7.8. Radar Termination Points.

     7.8.1. Aircraft shall descend no lower than the Minimum Vectoring Altitude (Attachment
     22) until cancelling IFR.

     7.8.2. Aircraft shall make every effort to avoid over-flying populated areas at low altitude
     and advise RAPCON of deviations.

     7.8.3. T-1s will monitor RAPCON and squawk assigned code until within approximately 3
     miles of the radar termination point (IFR or VFR). RAPCON may continue to provide
     vectors after the aircrew has cancelled IFR to aid in separation between other aircraft on
     recovery. Aircrew shall comply with these vectors until the conflict is resolved either by
     visual contact or other means.

          7.8.3.1. When approaching the radar termination point and able to proceed VFR,
          aircraft shall cancel IFR with RAPCON. RAPCON will respond with “ROGER”
          meaning radar service is terminated, squawk 0000.

          7.8.3.2. T-1s shall remain outside 10 DME until reaching the radar termination point.
          Aircraft shall be wings level at 1,700’ one mile prior to termination point. Aircrew
          shall change to Live Oak/ATC tower and report the gate. Aircrew are expected to
          cancel IFR no later than 3 miles prior to radar termination. If unable to cancel IFR
          due to frequency congestion, aircraft will squawk 0000 and contact Live Oak/ATC
          tower. After crossing the radar termination point, aircraft shall follow their respective
          groundtrack.

7.9. Radar Vector to Initial Procedures.

     7.9.1. Radar vectors to initial may be conducted at anytime the ATC tower has operational
     control of the center and outside and/or inside runways, traffic permitting.

     7.9.2. Aircrew shall request the overhead approach on initial contact with RAPCON or
     prior to reaching 15 flying miles from the runway. Aircrew shall report, “COLUMBUS
     APPROACH, (CALL SIGN), 20 MILES SOUTHEAST WITH (ATIS), REQUESTING
     OVERHEAD (TYPE LANDING)”.

7.10. Tactical Initial. Refer to 6.11

7.11. VFR Arrivals. During recovery, aircraft shall contact Columbus Approach at
approximately 30NM for radar advisory service and runway approach clearance.

7.12. Center Runway Arrival Procedures.

     7.12.1. Contact Straight-In Approach. Aircrew shall declare “CONTACT” with RAPCON
     prior to 10 DME, but not prior to base leg. After RAPCON approves the approach, aircrew
     shall maintain 2,000’ MSL until intercepting a visual glidepath. Runway centerline will be
     established prior to 10 DME and maintained to the runway.

     7.12.2. The ATC tower will direct all frequency changes to departure/arrival. When the
     aircrew requests the “OPTION” to stay with the ATC tower in the VFR pattern, IFR
     clearance is terminated after crossing the runway threshold on IFR approaches.

7.13. Drag Procedures.

     7.13.1. The Drag procedure allows a formation to achieve nonstandard formation spacing
     on final. The trailing aircraft gains separation by reducing airspeed and shall squawk 0400.
     Aircraft are still treated as a single formation by ATC, and communications are directed to
     the lead aircraft. However, each aircraft in the formation shall confirm gear is down at the
     FAF.

     7.13.2. The lead aircraft will request the drag procedure upon initial call to ATC. Aircraft
     shall accomplish the drag and approach in daytime, during VMC conditions.

     7.13.3. The flight is considered a non-standard formation throughout the drag procedure.
     Each aircraft will confirm and call gear down at the Final Approach Fix.

     7.13.4. If landing clearance is canceled, both aircraft shall fly runway heading until turning
     crosswind or, if under IMC procedures, lead aircraft shall climb to 4,000' MSL and the
     wingman shall climb to 3,000' MSL following standard climb out instructions until
     separate clearances are obtained.

7.14. T-1 MOA Procedures. MOA procedures common to all airframes are in section 3.25.

     7.14.1. North Areas. On departure, aircrew shall request sector assignments with
     Columbus Departure (Ch 4) and may expect low block of 8,000’ to 14,000’ or high block
     of 16,000’ to 22,000’.
    7.14.1.2. If aircraft is cleared to a high sector but is unable to reach the block before
    entering other sectors or blocks, aircrew shall inform ATC. ATC will issue further
    instructions.

    7.14.1.3. Once established in the assigned sector, T-1s will automatically switch to
    Columbus Area Monitor (Ch 8) and report established.

    7.14.1.4. North Area Recoveries.

         7.14.1.4.1. Sectors 1-6. Aircrew will contact RAPCON (Ch 7) and request
         vectors for desired recovery.

         7.14.1.4.2. VFR Recoveries. The North/South gate recoveries are CAFB VFR
         arrival procedures that require RAPCON coordination. North/South gate entries
         must cancel IFR NLT 3NM prior to the gate. If unable to cancel IFR due to
         radio congestion, squawk 0000 to indicate IFR cancellation and contact Tower
         (Ch 3).

         7.14.1.4.3. Direct North/South Gate entry. Aircraft will fly at or below 7,000'
         MSL prior to departing the lateral boundaries of ATC assigned area. North gate
         is the primary point of entry to the pattern for runway 13 and is located at CBM
         348/011. South gate is the primary entry point to the pattern for runway 31 and
         is located at CBM 086/009. The first aircraft to arrive at the gate has the right-
         of-way. Aircraft will fly a heading of 220 at 200 KIAS at 1700' MSL and report
         to the ATC tower when one mile from the gate with intentions. Straight-in
         approaches may be requested at this point if desired.

7.14.2. CBM3 (West) MOA.

    7.14.2.1. Aircrew will be cleared into the MOA/ATCAA by Memphis Center.

    7.14.2.2. Aircrew shall switch to discrete frequency when directed.

    7.14.2.3. Aircraft will proceed to CLOUT then TOMLN. Aircrew shall fly direct to
    the assigned sector after reaching TOMLN or as directed. Aircrew will establish in a
    low block of 8,000’ to 14,000’ or high block 16,000’ to 22,000’. Aircrew shall not
    climb or descend into block altitudes until reaching lateral limits of the assigned area
    unless coordinated with other aircraft in the MOA.

    7.14.2.4. West MOA Recoveries. CBM3 MOA/ATCAA is controlled by Memphis
    ARTCC (CH 5). Aircrews will use Winona (IGB 266/50), EGUPT (CBM 314/40) or
    Houston (CBM 297/42) IFR recoveries to return to CAFB.

         7.14.2.4.1. Winona Recovery. Depart the lateral confines of the assigned sector
         at 15,000’ and proceed direct TOMLN direct IGB direct CBM. If requested,
         aircrew may execute the recovery at FL 230 in order to accomplish the High
         ILS Approach at CBM. Aircrew can expect direct to KOBRE when transferred
         to CBM RAPCON.

         7.14.2.4.2. EGUPT (CBM 314/40) recovery. Depart sector at 7,000’ MSL or
         Center assigned altitude. Intercept the CBM R-314 outside 45 DME. Track the
         CBM R-314 inbound. When handed off to Columbus Approach, make the same
         request as if returning from the North Area.

         7.14.2.4.3. Houston recovery. Depart sector at 7,000’ MSL or Center assigned
         altitude, proceed direct to Houston (CBM 297/42). Be at 5,000’ MSL by
         Houston, and upon reaching Houston, fly heading 090, expect radar vectors.

7.14.3. CBM4 (Pickwick) MOA.

    7.14.3.1. Aircrew will be cleared into the MOA/ATCAA by Memphis Center.

    7.14.3.2. T-1s will automatically switch to Memphis discrete (CH 10) and report
    established.

    7.14.3.3. CBM4 (Pickwick) MOA Recovery. Aircrews returning to CAFB should
    request the Pickwick recovery from Memphis Center.

         7.14.3.3.1. Pickwick High Recovery. Aircraft shall remain within assigned
         sector(s) until at FL230 or Center assigned altitude and then proceed direct
         KOBRE direct CBM.

         7.14.3.3.2. Pickwick Low Recovery. Aircraft shall remain within assigned
         sector(s) until reaching either 7,000 feet or Center assigned altitude and then
         proceed direct KOBRE direct CBM.

7.14.4. CBM2 (Echo) MOA.

    7.14.4.1. Aircrew will be cleared into the MOA/ATCAA by Memphis Center.
    Aircrew will remain on this frequency.

    7.14.4.2. Aircrew must coordinate times with the T-38 SUPT and IFF operations.
    See the North profile for departure procedures. T-1 aircraft may have difficulty
    making published climb restrictions and should coordinate for altitude deletions if
    required.

    7.14.4.3. CBM2 (Echo) MOA Recovery. Aircrew shall request Echo recovery from
    Memphis Center. Memphis Center issues an abbreviated clearance for an Echo
    recovery “(CALL SIGN), CLEARED ECHO RECOVERY, MAINTAIN
    (ALTITUDE).” Aircraft shall remain in the area until at 14,000’ MSL or Center
    assigned altitude and then proceed direct KOBRE, CBM. Aircraft should expect
          radar vectors at KOBRE.

     7.14.5. High Shuttle Areas. This airspace is primarily used for functional check flight
     (FCF) profiles. In accordance with the LOA, Memphis Center will assign a shuttle and a
     4,000’ altitude block, usually FL 250 - FL 290 or as requested. Aircrew shall proceed
     direct to assigned area after reaching FL 240. Shuttles may be denied depending on traffic.
     The shuttle areas are defined below.

Table 7.1. Shuttle Areas.

CAL 1     R-264 to R-333      12 - 40 DME
CAL 2     R-358 to R-089      12 - 34 DME
GRW       R-267 to R-288      45 - 81 DME
OXF       R-295 to R-317      45 - 79 DME
MEM       R-076 to R-093      65 - 100 DME

     7.14.6. Delay Areas. T-1 aircraft may request coordinated blocks of airspace identified as
     “standard patterns” from ATC to accomplish area work. These airspace blocks are not
     military operating areas and should be used when the local MOAs are unavailable or at
     other times on a limited basis only.

          7.14.6.1. Aircrew may reference the appropriate publication for the planned locations
          to conduct random holding. These areas have less congestion and will minimize
          conflicts. The controlling agency may restrict the lateral and vertical limits of the
          area temporarily to route traffic through, which may affect training accomplished.

          7.14.6.2. The “standard pattern” airspace must be coordinated. Aircrew shall file and
          retain an IFR clearance while using the “standard pattern” to maintain adequate
          separation between other IFR or participating VFR traffic.

          7.14.6.3. Aircrews should request a “DELAY AT THE (NAVAID, RADIAL/DME
          FIX), BLOCK ____ TO ____, STANDARD PATTERN.” The “standard pattern” is
          defined as 10 radials each side of the requested radial and out 20 DME from the
          requested holding fix. Normal block altitudes include 8,000’ to 11,000’ and 12,000’
          to 15,000’ or as approved.

          7.14.6.4. Aircrew shall call entering and exiting the delay areas in the blind on UHF
          CH 20 (Jayhawk Ops).

     7.14.7. Simulated Air Refueling Anchors. The Tupelo, Greenville, and the Berry
     Simulated Anchors are letter of agreement (LOA) airspace with Memphis Center.

          7.14.7.1. Memphis Center will normally assign a 2000’ block between FL250 and
          FL310 and the Tupelo Anchor and between FL180 and FL230 for the Greenville
          Anchor and Berry Anchor.
         7.14.7.2. The Tanker will declare MARSA prior to beginning the rendezvous. Both
         aircraft must squawk IFF when separated by more than 3 miles. Aircraft shall advise
         Memphis Center prior to splitting up for a second rendezvous.

         7.14.7.3. T-1s may stack in air refueling areas with at least 1,000’ between each
         altitude block with Memphis Center Approval. This is unlikely to occur during the
         following Memphis departure “push” times (1400Z-1530Z; 1815Z-1945Z; 2130Z-
         2345Z).

7.15. Lost Communication.

    7.15.1. Lost Communications on the Ground. When communication loss procedures
    require an aircraft to enter or cross an active runway the ATC tower/RSU will ensure the
    operation is safe and any required coordination is completed prior to initiating a light gun
    signal that will allow the aircraft with no radio capabilities to enter the runway.

         7.15.1.1. Holding for Runway 31C. Aircrew shall hold in the hammerhead and flash
         the taxi light at the RSU/ATC tower. The ATC tower will flash a green light at the
         aircraft when cleared to taxi via Taxiway F to park. Aircrews will then taxi forward
         of the runup area, turn left and proceed to the parking area against traffic. Ground
         Control will issue “give way” instruction to outbound traffic to mitigate conflicts.

         7.15.1.2. Holding for Runway 13C. Aircrew shall hold in the hammerhead and flash
         the taxi light at the RSU/ATC tower. After receiving a flashing green light from the
         ATC tower, taxi down the runway and turn off at Taxiway H and return to park.

         7.15.1.3. Holding for Runway 13L. Aircrew shall hold short of the runway and flash
         the taxi light at the RSU/ATC tower. After receiving a flashing green light from the
         RSU/ATC tower, the aircraft shall taxi down the runway and exit at the end. The
         aircraft will then hold short of runway 13C and shall accomplish the alerting signal to
         obtain approval from the ATC tower to cross the runway.. The ATC tower shall
         again issue a flashing green to allow the aircraft to continue taxing across Runway
         13C. Once the aircraft has exited Runway 13C it will taxi to park.

         7.15.1.4. Holding for Runway 31R Aircrew shall hold short of the runway and flash
         the taxi light at the RSU/ATC tower. After receiving a flashing green light from the
         RSU/ATC tower, the aircraft shall taxi down the runway and exit at the end. The
         aircraft will then hold short of runway 31C and accomplish the alerting signal to
         obtain approval from the ATC tower to cross the runway. The ATC tower shall issue
         a flashing green to allow the aircraft to continue taxing across Runway 31C. Once
         the aircraft has exited Runway 31C it will hold short of runway 31L and accomplish
         the alerting signal to obtain approval from the RSU/ATC tower to cross the runway.
         The RSU/ATC tower shall issue a flashing green to allow the aircraft to continue
         taxing across Runway 31L. Once the aircraft has exited Runway 31L it will taxi to
         park.
     7.15.1.5. Arriving aircraft to all runways will exit at the end of the runway and
     follow standard taxiing procedures to parking. Aircraft will hold short of all runways
     and monitor RSU/ATC tower for a flashing green light. RSU/ATC tower will issue a
     flashing green light to authorize the aircraft to cross the runway.

     7.15.1.6. Aircrew shall return to the parking area using caution and shall monitor
     ATC tower for additional light signals.

7.15.2. Lost Communications in Tower Airspace. If the aircraft loses communication in
ATC tower airspace prior to receiving landing clearance, aircraft will continue the
approach, squawk 7600, and aircrew will watch the ATC tower for a green light (clearance
to land). If a flashing red light, steady red light or flare is observed, aircraft will execute
the go around/missed approach procedures and follow lost communication procedures.

7.15.3. Lost Communications while in RAPCON Airspace:

     7.15.3.1. Aircraft shall squawk IFF code 7600. If fuel does not permit compliance
     with FLIP or local procedures or if another emergency exists, squawk emergency
     code 7700 continuously. Expect ATC to attempt contact on GUARD (243.0) or
     suitable NAVAID with instructions. If asked to “squawk fuel”, set pounds of fuel
     remaining in transponder (use 7 for an 8 or 9).

     7.15.3.2. Outside local area, comply with FLIP procedures.

     7.15.3.3. North Area (except Sector 6). Aircraft shall descend and maintain 7,000’ in
     lateral confines of area, proceed direct CBM 13DME and arc east or west to last
     assigned runway for an ILS approach to the center runway.

     7.15.3.4. Sector 6. Columbus RAPCON does not own 7,000’ in the vicinity of
     Tupelo. Aircraft shall descend to 8,000’ and proceed to CBM 330 radial (not entering
     sector 5). Upon intercepting CBM 330 radial inbound, descend and maintain 7,000’,
     intercept CBM 13 DME arc and arc east or west to last assigned runway. Once
     established on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’ for an ILS approach to
     runway 13C/31C.

     7.15.3.5. North Area (High Sectors). Aircraft shall climb to FL230 in lateral
     confines of area, proceed direct KOBRE and execute the High ILS Approach to the
     center runway.

     7.15.3.6. CBM3 (West) High. Aircraft shall climb to FL 230 in the confines of the
     area then direct to KOBRE at FL 230 and execute the High ILS Approach to the last
     assigned runway.

     7.15.3.7. CBM3 (West) Low. Aircraft shall descend to 7,000’ in lateral confines of
     area. Intercept V278, IGB, maintain 7,000’. Intercept CBM 13DME Arc and arc east
     or west to last assigned runway . Once established on the 13 DME arc, descend and
     maintain 4,000’ for an ILS approach to runway 13C/31C.

     7.15.3.8. CBM2 (Echo) / CBM4 (Picks) HIGH. Aircraft shall climb to FL 230 in the
     lateral confines of the area, proceed to KOBRE, execute HI-ILS approach to the last
     assigned runway.

     7.15.3.9. CBM2 (Echo) / CBM4 (Picks) LOW. Aircraft shall descend to 7,000’
     within the lateral confines of the area, then intercept the 13 DME Arc, and arc east or
     west to last assigned runway. Once established on the 13 DME arc, descend and
     maintain 4,000’ for an ILS approach to runway 13C/31C.

7.15.4. All aircraft returning to CAFB from the East, not covered above, will intercept
V278, maintain 7,000’. Intercept CBM 13DME, arc to last assigned runway. Once
established on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’ for an ILS approach to
runway 13C/31C.

7.15.5. All aircraft returning to CAFB from the West, not covered above, will intercept
V278, maintain 7,000’. Intercept CBM 13DME, Arc to last assigned runway. Once
established on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’ for an ILS approach to
runway 13C/31C.

7.15.6. Lost Communication While Flying Drag Approach.

     7.15.6.1. If the lead aircraft loses communications prior to receiving landing
     clearance, aircrew shall continue the approach, squawk 7600, and observe the ATC
     tower for a green light. If the aircrew observes a red light or flare, aircrew shall
     execute the go around/missed approach procedures and follow lost communications
     procedures.

     7.15.6.2. If the trailing aircraft loses communications, aircrew shall squawk 7600,
     follow the lead aircraft and land (if sufficient spacing exists and no red light/flares are
     observed). If a go around is required, aircrew shall execute the go around/missed
     approach procedures and follow lost communications procedures.
Chapter 8

EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

8.1. Operation of Primary/Secondary Crash Nets. The ATC tower activates the primary
crash alarm system (PCAS) for emergencies or any situation deemed appropriate by the ATC
tower supervisor to include, but not limited to: barrier engagements, 14 FTW aircraft accidents
within RAPCON or ATC tower's area of jurisdiction, hijack, hot brakes, unannounced
dangerous/hot cargo and ATC tower evacuation. Airfield Management Operations (AMOPs)
will activate the Secondary Crash Net after the activation of the PCAS. AMOPs will respond in
accordance with paragraph 1.2.1.

     8.1.1. The primary crash alarm system is not activated when emergency locator transmitter
     (ELT) beacon signals are heard unless an actual crash/emergency is known to exist. The
     ATC tower will notify AMOPS if an ELT is transmitting. AMOPS is designated as the
     control coordinator and will notify those agencies listed in its checklist by landlines.

     8.1.2. Aircraft Crash Off-Base. When notification is received by another agency that a
     crash has occurred outside of Tower/RAPCON’s airspace, AMOPS shall activate the
     Secondary Crash Net and relay the information received. RAPCON/ATC tower will direct
     all aircraft not directly involved in search and rescue efforts to remain clear of the crash
     area.

8.2. Crash Phone Data for Emergencies. The following information concerning emergency
aircraft is transmitted via the crash circuits:

     8.2.1. Minimum information required for emergencies:

            8.2.1.1. Nature of emergency: In-flight emergency, ground emergency or crash.

            8.2.1.2. Aircraft identification: Call sign/type of aircraft/tail number.

            8.2.1.3. Aircrew intentions/grid location. If applicable, location of cargo, safe fire
            fighting time and specific requirements relayed by the aircrew (aircraft carrying
            dangerous cargo).

     8.2.2. Additional information that may be gathered if time permits:

            8.2.2.1. Landing runway.

            8.2.2.2. Aircraft altitude.

            8.2.2.3. Fuel remaining, in time.

            8.2.2.4. Number of people on board.
          8.2.2.5. Emergency equipment on board.

          8.2.2.6. Crew location.

          8.2.2.7. Recovery frequency.

          8.2.2.8. Wind direction.

     8.2.3. The primary crash alarm system will be tested daily IAW control tower operating
     instructions.

     8.2.4. Facilities Contacted On the Primary/Secondary Crash Phone/Net. Contact numbers
     will be validated when this AFI is reviewed IAW AFI13-204v3.

     8.2.5. The ATC facility having knowledge of a crash or suspected crash within Columbus
     airspace will notify the opposite facility.

8.3. Emergency Response Procedures. Procedures for responding to a major aircraft crash or
emergency are listed in CAFB Plan 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan. In
addition to the procedures spelled out in CAFB Plan 10-2, the following emergency response
procedures apply to emergencies or mishaps occurring on the airfield. AMOPs will respond
IAW with paragraph 1.2.1.
NOTE: Wing Safety and Aerospace Medicine personnel will respond IAW AFI 91-202 CAFB
Supplement 1 and 14 MDGI 48-109.

    8.3.1. Emergency Vehicle Crossing RSU Controlled Runway (Runway Crossing Only).

         8.3.1.1. RSUs will afford priority to emergency response vehicles destined for the
         center runway or the outside runway.

               8.3.1.1.1. Discontinue departures that will delay the emergency response
               vehicles.

               8.3.1.1.2. Issue restricted low approach instructions at or above 700’ MSL to
               airborne aircraft conducting approaches to the inside runway until all
               emergency response vehicle crossings are complete.

         8.3.1.2. ATC tower will coordinate with RSUs as soon as practical to facilitate
         crossing of the inside runway by emergency response vehicles. IAW 9.8.2.1., the
         RSU (Sunfish/Live Oak) controlling agency will relinquish control of the runway
         surface area to ATC Tower.

               8.3.1.2.1. ATC tower will retain control of emergency response vehicles for the
               duration of the crossing and will cross the vehicles only after RSUs relinquishes
               the runway.

               8.3.1.2.2. ATC tower will notify RSUs when all crossings are complete so they
               may resume normal operations.

    8.3.2. Transfer of the inside or outside runway to the ATC tower during emergencies.

         8.3.2.1. The ATC tower will assume control of the inside or outside runway only
         after the RSU relinquishes control. When the RSU controller becomes aware of an
         emergency/mishap involving aircraft operating on or near the runway surface under
         their control, they will:

         8.3.2.2. Immediately issue restricted low approach instructions at or above 700’ MSL
         to airborne aircraft conducting approaches to the affected runway. Coordinate with
         the ATC tower for any aircraft requesting to proceed to the center runway.

         8.3.2.3. Discontinue all departures.

         8.3.2.4. Relinquish control of the runway surface via landlines or radios using the
         Phraseology “RUNWAY OPERATIONS SUSPENDED, TOWER ASSUMES
         CONTROL OF THE INSIDE/OUTSIDE RUNWAY SURFACE, SUNFISH/LIVE
         OAK RETAINS CONTROL OF THE PATTERN”.
     NOTE: Suspending runway operations only authorizes the ATC tower to grant
     vehicles access to the affected runway. Responsibility for aircraft operating in the
     RSU patterns remains with the appropriate RSU, unless otherwise coordinated. ATC
     tower will NOT assume control of the runway until specifically relinquished by RSU
     controller.

     8.3.2.5. Once the emergency is terminated AMOPs will conduct a runway check per
     para 1.2.1. and notify the ATC tower of runway status. Prior to resuming normal
     operations the ATC tower will confirm all vehicles are off the runway, and return
     control of the runway surface to the appropriate RSU using the phraseology
     “RESUME NORMAL RUNWAY OPERATIONS, ALL VEHICLES OFF THE
     RUNWAY, SUNFISH/LIVE OAK ASSUMES CONTROL OF INSIDE/OUTSIDE
     RUNWAY.”

8.3.3. Transfer of the center runway to Sunfish during Emergencies. When the inside
runway is closed or operations are suspended, and it becomes necessary to recover a solo
student on the center runway due to a minimum fuel state, physiological emergency, or
aircraft malfunction, control of the center runway may be transferred to Sunfish. Control
of the center runway should be transferred to Sunfish if the RSU controller or SOF
determines that keeping the emergency solo student in direct radio contact with the Sunfish
controller is necessary to increase the chance of a successful recovery. This procedure will
only be used for emergency/minimum fuel solo students and will not be used for normal T-
6 training aircraft. In order to ensure a safe and orderly flow of traffic the following
procedures will apply:

     8.3.3.1. ATC tower will direct all aircraft under their control to execute the following
     procedures:

           8.3.3.1.1 Aircraft at or inside of the final approach fix (FAF) for IFR
           approaches, 4 miles to fly or closer for VFR approaches, will continue their
           approach and either full stop or low approach, return to radar or turn crosswind
           and climb to 1,700’ if the VFR pattern is open.

           8.3.3.1.2. Aircraft conducting an IFR approach that are between FAF and the
           initial approach fix (IAF) will be directed to execute the appropriate missed
           approach procedure if the field is IFR. If the T-38C status is Restricted
           Overhead or better, aircraft will be directed to climb to 1,700’, continue along
           final approach course and either return to radar or turn crosswind at the
           departure end of the center runway and enter the VFR pattern.

           8.3.3.1.3. Aircraft conducting a VFR approach that are between 4-9 miles will
           be directed to climb to the overhead pattern altitude of 1,700’ MSL, carry
           through initial and turn crosswind at the departure end of the center runway.

           8.3.3.1.4. Aircraft conducting an IFR approach that are at or outside of the IAF
           will be broken off of the approach and sent back to Approach Control.
                 8.3.3.1.5. Aircraft conducting a VFR approach with more than 9 miles to fly
                 will be broken off the approach and directed to one of the VFR entry gates.

                 8.3.3.1.6. ATC tower will transmit, “All aircrews plan on carrying straight
                 through initial until further advised”.

           8.3.3.2. Once ATC tower has ensured all aircraft in the VFR pattern are established
           at 1,700’ and there are no other aircraft inbound, they will transfer control of the
           center runway to Sunfish using established transfer procedures. Sunfish will advise
           emergency aircraft to remain at or below 1,200’ MSL. Sunfish will retain control of
           the center runway for the minimum time necessary for the emergency student solo to
           execute a full stop. ATC tower will maintain control of all other aircraft in the center
           runway pattern. Practice approaches by student solos or any type approaches by
           additional aircraft are not authorized.

           8.3.3.3. Once the student solo lands safely and is at a safe taxi speed, Sunfish will
           direct them to contact ATC tower. Sunfish will then contact ATC tower and
           relinquish control of the center runway using established transfer procedures.

           8.3.3.4. Once the runway transfer is complete, ATC tower will restore the normal
           flow of traffic.

     8.3.4. The SOF will determine the need for an AM response based on a combination of
     traffic pattern saturation, weather status and type of aircraft emergency.

           8.3.4.1. List of types of Emergencies that will require an AM response. (The list is
           not meant to be all inclusive)

                 8.3.4.1.1 Structural Damage

                 8.3.4.1.2. Landing in the overrun

                 8.3.4.1.3 Fire Light

                 8.3.4.1.4. Engine Problem

                 8.3.4.1.5 Tire/Brake Problem

                 8.3.4.1.6 Hydraulic/Gear Problem

                 8.3.4.1.7 Bird Strike

8.4. External Stores/Jettison Procedures. Aircraft assigned at CAFB are not equipped with
jettison capability. The external stores jettison area is the grass area north of the outside runway.
Once an emergency has been declared that requires the aircrew to jettison external stores, the
SOF determines if the RSU needs to be evacuated.
     8.4.1. VFR Jettison Procedures (aircrew may visually navigate to avoid over flight of
     populated areas).

          8.4.1.1. RAPCON will vector the aircraft to 10 mile straight-in final. Once the
          aircraft reaches 10-mile final, all aircraft in the Live Oak pattern will climb and
          maintain 2,700’ MSL or breakout to RAPCON. The ATC tower assumes control of
          the outside runway.

          8.4.1.2. The ATC tower will instruct vehicles to remain south of the center runway.

          8.4.1.3. Time permitting and/or at SOF’s request; AMOPS personnel will coordinate
          with Security Forces to ensure all personnel in the jettison area are evacuated and will
          conduct a FOD check IAW paragraph 1.2.1.

          8.4.1.4. ATC will instruct the aircraft to make an approach parallel to the runway in
          the direction of traffic at or below 1,000' AGL, approximately 1,000' northeast of the
          outside runway.

          8.4.1.5. The ATC tower controllers will not advise the aircrew when to jettison
          external stores.

          8.4.1.6. Resume normal airfield operations after AMOPS has checked the area.

     8.4.2. IFR Jettison Procedures:

          8.4.2.1. RAPCON will provide vectors to aircraft for a straight in approach.

          8.4.2.2. When the aircraft is 25 flying miles from Columbus AFB, the ATC tower
          will suspend airfield operations and ensure all vehicles remain south of the center
          runway. ATC will instruct the aircrew to fly a published approach until breaking out
          of the weather. After reaching VMC, the aircrew should proceed VFR to the external
          stores jettison area.

8.5. Fuel Dumping. Columbus has no designated fuel dumping area. Fuel dumping will be
IAW JO 7110.65.

8.6. Aircraft Arresting Systems (AAS) Emergency Procedures.

     8.6.1. BAK-15 barriers will be raised IAW JO 7110.65 at the request of aircrew, Live
     Oak, Supervisor of Flying, AMOPS and Barrier Maintenance. The barrier will be raised
     when the aircrew calls “BARRIER, BARRIER, BARRIER” on either ATC tower or Live
     Oak frequency. The primary responsibility for raising the barrier rests with the agency
     that is controlling the runway (i.e., ATC tower or Live Oak). Columbus ATC tower
     personnel will monitor appropriate frequencies and remain poised to raise the barrier at a
     moment's notice or upon the request of the agency controlling the runway. As conditions
     permit, the SOF will monitor the Live Oak frequency and remain poised to direct ATC
     tower personnel to raise the barrier. The agency responsible for the runway in use shall
     make the first attempt to raise the barrier. Other agencies with the capability of raising the
     BAK-15 will not do so unless specifically requested by the agency controlling the runway.

     8.6.2. If not on ATC tower or Live Oak frequency during approaches, aircrew may call for
     the barrier on the approach frequency. RAPCON will call ATC tower to raise the barrier.

     8.6.3. If an aircraft under RAPCON control requires the barrier in a specific position,
     RAPCON will notify the ATC tower as soon as practical. During normal duty hours, a
     minimum of 2 ½ hours is required between successive engagements to allow maintenance
     the opportunity to inspect and reconfigure the MA-1A barrier and 8 hours for the BAK-15.
     After normal duty hours, a 4-hour window between successive MA-1A engagements and
     10 hours for BAK-15 engagements may be required due to increased response times of on-
     call maintenance personnel.

     8.6.4. AMOPS shall conduct a runway check IAW para 1.2.1 and 4.5.6.

8.7. Hot Brakes. If hot brakes are suspected, aircraft will inform Ground Control and taxi to a
designated hot brake area and park aircraft facing upwind. Designated hot brake areas are the
North and South Hammerheads and Taxiway J.

8.8. Abandonment of Aircraft. The controlled bailout area is over the uninhabited area
northwest of Caledonia, MS. CBM 050/006 (IGB 028/016), at 7,000’ MSL. Aircrew will
abandon the aircraft on a heading that appears to be the least inhabited (approximately 050).

8.9. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitter Response.

     8.9.1. The RAPCON and the ATC tower will advise the opposite facility when an
     unscheduled ELT is heard.

     8.9.2. The ATC tower will advise AMOPS of an ELT's start/stop time. AMOPS will notify
     at a minimum the following facilities: maintenance operations center and all squadron life
     support facilities.

     8.9.3. The RAPCON will advise Memphis ARTCC of an ELT's start/stop time.

     8.9.4. The ATC tower and RAPCON assume the responsibility of the other facility if
     either is closed.

     8.9.5. In the event of a crash, the ATC facility responsible for that traffic will plot the
     aircraft's coordinates and advise all aircraft not participating in air rescue to remain clear of
     the crash area. 14 FTW aircraft will not participate in SAR without 14 FTW/CC approval.
8.10. Armament/Hung Ordnance Procedures.

    8.10.1. Aircraft landing at Columbus AFB with armament are directed to the De-arm Area
    (Taxiway A1 or F) for de-arming. Aircraft with hot guns, rockets, etc., will park with
    weapons facing 310° (Rwy 31) or 130 (Rwy 13) until ordnance is safed. The ATC tower
    will notify AMOPS of ordnance status. The ATC tower will not allow vehicles or aircraft
    to operate in front of an aircraft awaiting de-arming of unsafe forward propelled/firing
    munitions.

    8.10.2. De-arming, safing and arming of transient aircraft will be accomplished by
    qualified individuals IAW AFI 21-101, Chapter 16, or the aircrew of the aircraft.
    Columbus AFB Transient Alert personnel are not qualified to perform this function IAW
    AFI 21-201. Transient alert personnel will notify the ATC tower after all munitions have
    been safed.

8.11. Evacuation of ATC and AM Ops Facilities.

    8.11.1. The ATC tower/RAPCON may become unusable for any of the following reasons:
    anytime the wind velocity reaches 78 knots or greater (ATC tower only), complete
    electrical failure, RAPCON/ATC tower falls within the withdrawal distance of an on-base
    accident that involves dangerous cargo or hazardous materials and on confirmed bomb
    threats. If the airfield is open, tower will relocate.

    8.11.2. The WS/SC (WS)/Senior Controller (SC) is the final authority in determining
    whether the ATC tower/RAPCON will be evacuated and shall ensure that their respective
    facility checklists are accomplished prior to evacuating the facility.

    8.11.3. ATC tower evacuation.

    CS/SCOA shall deliver an AN/PRC-113, portable UHF/VHF transceiver, to the
    approach end RSU as soon as possible.

    8.11.3.5. The primary evacuation facility for nonessential personnel is the RAPCON
    or the far end of the parking lot as directed by the watch supervisor and based on the
    threat and/or operational requirements (as determined by the Watch Supervisor). The
    WS/SC may direct personnel to remain on standby status. All personnel will be
    accounted for.

    8.11.3.6. After ATC tower has been evacuated, all center runway operations will be
    suspended and taxi operation will be at the aircrew’s own risk. Vehicles will remain
    off all runways.

    8.11.3.7. If ATC tower is unable to make broadcasts over the crash phone and FM
    nets, RAPCON WS/SC is responsible for making the general UHF/VHF radio calls.
    AMOPS will make radio calls on the FM net and assume responsibility for the crash
    phone.

    8.11.3.8. RAPCON WS/SC shall also monitor ATC tower frequencies and issue
    ATC advisories/information to aircraft as directed by ATC tower WS/SC. All
    inbound aircraft will be advised that only full-stop landings are authorized.

    8.11.3.9. Control of airfield lighting will be done via the FM Net to airfield lighting
    personnel. 14 CES shall designate personnel to control the lights until the evacuation
    is terminated.

    8.11.3.10. Alternate facility procedures defined in Tower OI 13-204.

8.11.4. RAPCON evacuation.

    8.11.4.1. Time permitting; RAPCON CCTLR shall advise AOF/CC and AMOPS of
    reason for evacuation.

    8.11.4.2. One watch supervisor qualified person will be sent to the ATC tower to act
    as an advisor concerning ATC coordination with Memphis Center. Personnel will not
    attempt to operate a conventional approach control from the ATC tower nor use the
    Tower Radar Display to provide vectors.

    8.11.4.3. The primary evacuation facility for nonessential personnel is the far end of
    the parking lot. If there is inclement weather, ATC personnel will evacuate to the
    Fire Department via the main entrance (Do not enter via the flight line side). The
    senior ranking member will sign in at the Emergency Communication Center (ECC)
    and provide the ECC the total number of evacuees. Evacuees shall use caution for
    and give way to responding emergency vehicles. The WS/SC may direct personnel to
    remain on standby status. All personnel will be accounted for.
     8.11.4.4. Aircraft will not be permitted to depart CAFB during a RAPCON
     evacuation. Aircraft inbound shall be notified of the closure and a course of action
     shall be recommended by the SOF.

     8.11.4.5. If the RAPCON is evacuated for a bomb threat, the WS/SC shall remain (or
     designate someone to remain) at the entry control point (ECP) in order to assist
     Security Forces in searching the building and identifying unknown/suspicious objects
     unless otherwise directed by on-scene commander. If possible, the RAPCON
     building custodian should be selected to assist Security Forces.

8.11.5. AMOPS duties during ATC tower evacuation.

     8.11.5.1. Activate the Secondary Crash Phone and advise agencies the ATC tower is
     being evacuated.

          8.11.5.1.1. If the ATC tower was unable to transmit over the RAMP NET,
          advise vehicles on the RAMP NET the ATC tower is being evacuated and to
          remain off ALL runways.

          NOTE: This transmission must be repeated three times over the RAMP NET.

     8.11.5.2. AMOPS shall implement their respective checklist for ATC tower facility
     evacuation and notify appropriate agencies of the situation.

     8.11.5.3. Each agency will implement their respective checklists and will be notified
     should anything change.

8.11.6. AMOPS duties during RAPCON evacuation. AMOPS will issue a NOTAM and
advise Memphis/Atlanta ARTCC and other facilities

8.11.7. AMOPS Evacuation.

     8.11.7.1. AMOPS at a minimum shall initiate the SCN and notify ATC
     tower/RAPCON. Then AMOPS will evacuate to the RAPCON facility. A NOTAM
     shall be sent as necessary and all applicable checklists shall be completed as soon as
     possible.

     8.11.7.2. Airfield Management Shift Lead (AMSL) and at least one AMOPS
     representative will report to the RAPCON with the evacuation kit. AMSL will notify
     the Control Tower, RAPCON, Command Post and Fire Department of AMOPS
     arrival at RAPCON.

     NOTE: All agencies will be notified when AMOPS returns to the primary Facility.

     8.11.7.3. The primary evacuation facility for the remaining personnel is bldg 862,
     Parachute Survival Shop. The secondary evacuation facility is the OSS conference
           room in bldg 230. The AMSL may direct personnel to remain on standby status. All
           personnel will be accounted for.

     8.11.8. Upon returning to ATC tower/RAPCON/AMOPS following an evacuation,
     personnel shall conduct the procedures in the "opening" checklist prior to resuming
     operations.

     8.11.9. ATC tower CCTLR shall ensure controllers are scheduled for initial and refresher
     training on RSU equipment and operating procedures and fly-away kits contain materials to

8.12. Emergency Landing Procedures (ELPs). ELP patterns are authorized for local T-6
aircraft (any runway).

8.13. Hydrazine/Emergency Power Unit (EPU) Activation. ATC tower will activate the
crash phone when EPU activation is suspected or confirmed and advise all vehicles (except those
responding) and aircraft to remain well clear of the area. Direct aircraft to the designated
parking area, Taxiway M, and inform the aircrew of the wind.

NOTE: EPU activation may produce a white puff of smoke underneath the right wing.

8.14. Aircraft Mishap Reporting Procedures. Mishap/Accident reporting procedures are
located in CAFB Plan 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan.

8.15. UHF Single Frequency Approach (SFA). Aircrew with an emergency can request an
SFA (Ch 15/307.175) for recovery and landing from ATC. The aircrew may request an SFA to
minimize channel changes and coordinate the safe recovery with the controlling agency, SUP
and SOF. The SOF, RAPCON, ATC tower, and Fire Department are available on this
frequency for assistance. Aircrew must return to the RSU frequency prior to entering an RSU
controlled pattern.

8.16. Local ELP Airfields. T-6 Aircraft may utilize any local airfield for emergency engine-out
landing purposes. ELP operations will be conducted IAW 5.3.6 of this instruction.

8.17. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA). Columbus AFB has been designated as an emergency
divert base for the RQ-4 assigned to the 12th RS, Beale AFB, CA.

8.17.7. Towing of the RPA will be conducted in accordance with the CD/DVD located
within the RPA’s storage compartment. The RPA will be parked at a location determined
by Airfield Management in coordination with the aircraft owners.

8.17.8. Airfield Management will notify leadership when any change in airfield status will
affect the base’s ability to support RPA divert operations. After receiving leadership
approval, Airfield Management will notify the respective RPA operations center of the
changes in airfield status that prevent the base’s ability to support a RPA divert.
Chapter 9

RUNWAY SUPERVISORY UNIT COORDINATION PROCEDURES

9.1. General.

     9.1.1. The Runway Supervisory Unit (RSU) practice area operations within Columbus
     Class C airspace are governed by this instruction and AETCI 11-204. Practice area
     operations are exempt from Class C requirements IAW FAA Order 7210.3 and are in effect
     when a runway is controlled by the respective RSU.

     9.1.2. RAPCON will not allow non-base assigned aircraft to enter the practice area
     airspace delegated to the RSUs, when RSU operations are in progress, unless prior
     coordination is made with the ATC tower and applicable RSU. RAPCON will ensure
     separation is provided between RSU traffic and aircraft transitioning the Columbus Class C
     airspace.

9.2. RSU/SOF Advisories. The ATC tower and radar controllers will relay RSU/SOF
advisories when workload and traffic permit. Advisories will be prefaced with “RSU/SOF
ADVISES”.

9.3. Runway Control Transfer. Transfer of the runway is as follows: “tower/Live Oak/Sunfish
assumes control of runway XX at 1505Z”, followed by the controller’s initials. When transfer
occurs at the beginning of daily operations or after a runway change, ATC tower advises the
controller of barrier status.

9.4. Runway Crossing Procedures for Vehicles/Transient Aircraft.

     9.4.1. When Sunfish Controls Runway 13R:

            9.4.1.1. The ATC tower will coordinate with Sunfish RSU for approval prior to
            crossing transient aircraft/vehicles on runway 13R.

            9.4.1.2. While aircraft/vehicles are crossing 13R, radio contact will be maintained
            with the ATC tower. If the vehicle is UHF radio equipped, ATC tower may direct the
            vehicle to contact Sunfish (374.1).

            9.4.1.3. Sunfish RSU controllers are responsible for ensuring that all low approaches
            are conducted at or above 500 feet AGL when a vehicle is present on the runway and
            shall resume normal operations when the vehicle is off of the runway.

            9.4.1.4. The ATC tower will coordinate with Sunfish RSU for approval prior to
            allowing an aircraft to taxi across the extended centerline of runway 13R when
            utilizing the alert area.
     9.4.2. When Sunfish RSU Controls Runway 31L or Live Oak RSU controls the outside
     runway:

          9.4.2.1. The ATC tower will coordinate with the appropriate RSU for approval prior
          to crossing transient aircraft or vehicles on runway(s) 13L/31R/31L.

          9.4.2.2. While transient aircraft/vehicles are crossing runway(s) 13L/31R/31L, radio
          contact will be maintained with the ATC tower.

9.5. Sunfish/Live Oak Departures.

     9.5.1. Unless coordinated with RAPCON, Sunfish will provide RAPCON 90 seconds
     between departures.

     9.5.2. The Live Oak controller will obtain an IFR release from ATC tower before allowing
     an IFR aircraft to depart the VFR pattern. Live Oak will call ATC tower at 9 and 4 miles
     for release, and when the aircraft is at the approach end.

          9.5.2.1. If ATC tower is unable to release an aircraft, the aircraft may opt to conduct
          another pattern to attempt obtaining IFR release or the aircraft may conduct a
          breakout from the pattern and resume their departure VFR.

     9.5.3. Live Oak will contact RAPCON when an aircraft departs VFR to the MOAs.

9.6. Transient Aircraft Landing on RSU-controlled Runway.

     9.6.1. At receipt of an inbound transient from AMOPS, ATC tower will relay call sign,
     aircraft type, and ETA to both RSUs. When the transient is at 5NM, ATC tower will notify
     the RSUs via landline. If the runway is controlled by an RSU, the RSU will provide ATC
     tower with landing clearance. If the transient is unable to get landing clearance at 5NM, a
     go-around will be directed at 700’ MSL over the runway of intended landing.

          9.6.1.1. During dual runway operations, the SOF in conjunction with the ATC tower
          and RAPCON determine the landing runway. RAPCON will notify the appropriate
          RSU when the aircraft is 25 flying miles from touchdown. When 15NM from
          touchdown, ATC tower will notify the appropriate RSU via landline. When 10NM
          from touchdown, ATC tower will notify the appropriate RSU via landline. At that
          time, the RSU will not allow straight-ins, closed patterns or pitchouts until the
          transient is inside 5NM.

          9.6.1.2. If the transient will land on the inside runway, Sunfish will direct aircraft on
          90-to-initial to climb to 2200' MSL and carry straight-through-initial. (If weather
          precludes this, aircraft will fly an offset initial to avoid flying directly over the
          runway). At 5NM, normal operations may resume. Aircraft may expect to descend
          on the turn from crosswind to downwind. Aircraft will execute a restricted low
          approach (at or above 700’ MSL) and offset until the transient is off the runway.
          9.6.1.3. If the transient will land on the outside runway and Live Oak controls the
          runway, Live Oak will direct aircraft on 45 and 90-to-initial legs to “GIVE WAY”. (If
          weather precludes this, fly an offset initial, avoiding over-flight of the runway and
          carry straight through initial). Live Oak will direct all subsequent aircraft to report
          90-to-initial and issue instructions to ensure proper separation. At 5NM, normal
          operations may resume. Aircraft will execute a restricted low approach (at or above
          700’ MSL) and offset until the transient is off the runway.

          9.6.1.4. Departure Procedures: ATC tower will relay the type of aircraft and
          proposed departure times to the appropriate RSU and will notify both RSUs as the
          transient aircraft begins to taxi.

          9.6.1.4.l. Transient departing Live Oak runway: ATC tower will receive
          authorization from Live Oak for the transient to depart. Live Oak will cease all other
          departures until notified by ATC tower that departures may resume.

          9.6.1.4.2. Transient departing Sunfish runway. ATC tower will receive authorization
          from Sunfish for the transient to depart. Sunfish will cease all other departures until
          notified by ATC tower that departures may resume.

9.7. RSU Radio Failure.

     9.7.1. When an RSU experiences complete radio failure during local flying training, the
     RSU will notify ATC tower via landline. Tower assumes control of the respective runway
     on the appropriate RSU frequency and then directs a frequency change to Ch 3. The RSU
     will notify the ATC tower and SOF if any solos are in the pattern.

     9.7.2. If landlines are inoperative, the RSU will utilize RSU Net to contact Tower. In the
     event the RSU Net is inoperative, fire two flares in rapid succession indicating radio
     failure. Prior to assuming control, ATC tower will check communications on the landlines
     and the RSU radio frequency to ensure radio failure has occurred.

     9.7.3. For an RSU radio failure, ATC tower will full stop all solo students, but may allow
     continued operations by dual aircraft as directed by the SOF. Aircrew can expect the ATC
     tower or the SOF to direct aircraft to full stop or to leave the pattern. If student training is
     to continue utilizing the RSU, the SOF shall reference AETCI 11-204 for minimum RSU
     requirements.

     9.7.4. ATC tower will make a call on guard, “All aircraft in Sunfish/Live Oak’s Pattern,
     Contact tower, Ch 3”.

9.8 Runway Crossing/Access Procedures for Emergency Response Vehicles

     9.8.1. All Runway Crossings/Access will be given to emergency vehicles over the Crash
     Net by the ATC tower.
9.8.2. When Sunfish (Runway 13R/31L) or Live Oak (Runway or 13L/31R) are under
RSU control:

     9.8.2.1. The RSU (Sunfish/Live Oak) controlling agency will relinquish control of
     the runway surface area to ATC Tower but maintain control of the pattern/aircraft in
     order to expedite emergency response vehicles onto/across the RSU controlled
     runway. NOTE: This only applies to emergency vehicles en-route to the emergency,
     or until terminated.

     9.8.2.2. Time permitting, tower will call the appropriate RSU’s when the Crash
     Phone has been activated to inform them of the emergency location; this will allow
     the RSU time to prepare for vehicle crossing/access.

     9.8.2.3. Tower will call the RSU for control of the runway surface area only. The
     RSUs are responsible for ensuring all landing aircraft have exited the runway and all
     airborne aircraft have been issued low approaches at or above 500 feet AGL before
     giving tower control of the surface area (Phraseology: “Tower assumes control of
     Runway (designator) surface area only, all aircraft will conduct restricted low
     approaches until further advised”). To return control of the surface area back to the
     RSU: (Phraseology: “Sunfish/Live Oak assumes control of Runway (designator)
     surface area”).

     9.8.2.4. If any RSU controlled aircraft needs to land while tower controls the surface
     area, the RSU will coordinate with the ATC tower for available options.
Chapter 10

MISCELLANEOUS

10.1. Alternate NAVAID Procedures. Alternate NAVAID procedures will be implemented
any time the Caledonia VORTAC is out of service.

    10.1.1. Departure Procedures.

         10.1.1.1. T-6 Operations. Remain unchanged.

         10.1.1.2. T-38C and T-1 Operations. All departures will be via radar vectors and
         should expect runway heading with a climb to 5,000’ MSL.

    10.1.2. MOA Procedures. All wing aircraft will maintain area boundaries by visual
    references or GPS points. If unable, aircrew will notify RAPCON as soon as practical.

    10.1.3. Recovery/Arrival Procedures.

         10.1.3.1. T-6 Operations. For any status equal to or better than restricted overhead,
         aircraft should expect radar vectors to standard radar termination points. For IFR
         recovery status, aircraft should expect radar vectors to the Columbus RNAV (GPS) E
         or F. Slots status procedures are unchanged. If the radar goes out, aircrews can either
         recover to the standard radar termination points, request ILS or LOC/DME 13/31C, or
         divert to an airport that has a useable approach and/or radar service.

               10.1.3.1.1. In contingency situations (e.g., Lost Comm), aircrew shall use
               published canned flight plan routings (Attachment 20) in addition to good
               judgment as a guide to determine the best course of action.

         10.1.3.2 T-38C and T-1 Operations. For any status equal to or better than dual,
         aircrew may expect radar vectors to the standard radar termination points. For any
         status equal to or worse than restricted overhead, aircrew may expect radar vectors to
         ILS/LOC final. If the radar is not functioning, T-38C aircraft have no useful
         instrument approaches at CAFB. Aircrews can either recover to the standard radar
         termination points or divert to an airport that has a useable approach and/or radar
         service. If radar is not functioning, T-1 aircraft may request the ILS or LOC/DME
         13/31C, or divert to an airport that has a usable approach and/or radar service.

               10.1.3.2.1. In contingency situations (e.g., Lost Comm), aircrew shall use
               published canned flight plan routings (Attachments 21 and 22) in addition to
               good judgment as a guide to determine the best course of action.
10.2. Flyby Procedures.

     10.2.1. Local Flybys. The flight lead of local (CAFB) flybys will brief the squadron SUPs,
     SOF, and AMOPS at least 2 hours prior to the time over target (TOT) for all actual and
     practice events. The SOF will be the on-scene commander for local flybys. The flight lead
     is responsible for ensuring flybys are documented on all squadron's ops notes the day prior
     to the event.

     10.2.2. The formation will orbit as necessary north of the CBM 040 radial, 22 DME fix.
     The run-in will be made perpendicular to the runways to arrive over the flagpole at the
     designated TOT. Prior to departing the CBM 040/022 DME fix, the flight will cancel IFR.

     10.2.3. Prior to starting inbound, all VFR patterns must be directed to the high pattern
     altitude of 3,200' MSL. EXCEPTION: If the flyby is executing a missing man pull-up,
     Sunfish or ATC tower will ensure all aircraft in the runway 13R/31L pattern have landed or
     departed the pattern prior to the flyby inbound run to de-conflict outside downwind. The
     final run-in will be at 1,000’ AGL at 200 knots (T-6/T-1), 300 knots (T-38C).

     10.2.4. During inclement weather, 14 OG/CC will make the go/no-go decision 2 hours
     prior to TOT.

     10.2.5. Flyby Time Table - The following procedures will be implemented at the
     designated times to ensure positive aircraft separation throughout the flyby:

          10.2.5.1. 20 minutes prior to TOT:

                10.2.5.1.1. Lead notifies the SOF (Ch 12) of their position, confirms the TOT,
                and whether or not they are doing a “Missing Man” procedure.

                10.2.5.1.2. The SOF notifies squadron SUPs, Sunfish, Live Oak, ATC tower
                and RAPCON of the TOT.

                10.2.5.1.3. Sunfish, Live Oak and ATC tower (if ATC tower is controlling a
                VFR pattern) broadcast, “FLYBY PROCEDURES WILL BE IN EFFECT IN
                15 MINUTES, ALL AIRCREW PLAN YOUR MISSIONS ACCORDINGLY”.
                Sunfish and Live Oak monitor appropriate SOF/ATC tower frequency for
                coordination with the flyby aircrew.

          10.2.5.2. 15 minutes prior to TOT - Sunfish, Live Oak and ATC tower, as applicable,
          broadcast, “FLYBY PROCEDURES WILL BE IN EFFECT IN 10 MINUTES. ALL
          AIRCREW PLAN YOUR MISSIONS ACCORDINGLY.”

          10.2.5.3. 10 minutes prior to TOT:

                10.2.5.3.1. RAPCON discontinues Runway 13C/31C approaches and notifies
                ATC tower. Only those aircraft inside 10 DME on final will be allowed to
     continue their approach. Aircraft outside 10 DME on final requesting entry to
     either RSU pattern will be instructed to climb to breakout altitude for vectors to
     radar initial/radar termination point. Aircraft outside 10 DME on final
     requesting back to radar will be instructed to climb and maintain 4,000’ MSL,
     fly runway heading.

     10.2.5.3.2. Sunfish, Live Oak, and/or ATC tower, broadcast, “FLYBY
     PROCEDURES WILL BE IN EFFECT IN 5 MINUTES, ALL AIRCREW
     WITH LESS THAN 500# (T-6), OR 1200# (T-38C), PLAN YOUR NEXT
     PATTERN TO A FULL-STOP.”

10.2.5.4. Five minutes prior to TOT:

     10.2.5.4.1. Sunfish, Live Oak and ATC tower call RAPCON and advise all
     radar/VFR entries to enter the pattern at breakout altitude until further advised.

     10.2.5.4.2. Sunfish, Live Oak, and ATC tower, as applicable, broadcast,
     “FLYBY PROCEDURES ARE NOW IN EFFECT. ALL AIRCRAFT CLIMB
     AND MAINTAIN 3,200’ MSL AND CARRY STRAIGHT-THROUGH
     INITIAL UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.”

     10.2.5.4.3. SOF confirms with Sunfish, Live Oak, ATC tower and RAPCON
     that pattern entries are at breakout altitude for T-6s, T-1s, and T-38Cs.

     10.2.5.4.4. Flight Lead will contact ATC tower (Ch 3) with position and TOT.

     10.2.5.4.5. SOF confirms with ATC tower to stop launches until completion of
     the flyby.

10.2.5.5. TOT - Flyby aircraft crosses the flagpole.

10.2.5.6. After completion of the flyby:

     10.2.5.6.1. Flyby flight maintains at or below 1,700’ MSL. ATC tower directs
     the flight to contact RAPCON on Ch 14. RAPCON will not climb the aircraft
     above 1,700’ MSL until passing 7 DME. After aircraft are outside 7 DME,
     RAPCON will notify Sunfish that the flyby is complete and Sunfish will resume
     normal operations.

     10.2.5.6.2. SOF/ATC tower will notify Live Oak that the flyby is complete.

     10.2.5.6.3. Sunfish and Live Oak notify RAPCON and ATC tower when their
     patterns are open for normal ops.
                10.2.5.6.4. Sunfish, Live Oak, and ATC tower direct all traffic to descend to
                pattern altitude on the turn from crosswind to downwind and resume normal
                operations.

10.3. Alert Procedures.

     10.3.1. Columbus AFB does not have an alert mission.

10.4. Closed Runway Operations.

     10.4.1. Center Runway Closure. Sunfish will continue normal operations from the T-6
     VFR pattern on the Inside Runway. Minimum forecast weather conditions for returning to
     CAFB are side-step minimums. Radar delay patterns and multiple approaches should be
     minimized. These affect departures and must be coordinated by the SUPs and the SOF.
     Contact/instrument restricted low approaches to the Center Runway will descend no lower
     than 700' MSL.

          10.4.1.1. During Live Oak recoveries, Live Oak will continue normal operations of
          the T-38C VFR pattern on the Outside Runway. T-1 aircraft will request one VFR
          straight in to a full stop.

          10.4.1.2. When ATC tower controls the Outside Runway, aircraft shall minimize
          pattern operation. Departures have priority; aircraft shall anticipate restricted low
          approaches.

          10.4.1.3. A restricted low approach to the center may be flown if that aircraft is
          authorized in the outside pattern. It should be followed by a crosswind entry to
          outside pattern. Aircrew shall plan on sufficient fuel to return to radar. If scheduled
          for the outside pattern and denied a crosswind entry, aircrew shall maintain runway
          heading and climb to 2,700’ MSL. Aircrew shall proceed to the VFR entry point and
          remain clear of the outside pattern ground track.

     10.4.2. Outside Runway Closure. Sunfish will continue normal operations from the T-6
     VFR pattern on the Inside Runway. The outside pattern is flown to the Center Runway.
     No practice approaches or radar delays will be flown to the Center Runway during VFR
     pattern operations. During Live Oak recoveries, T-1s shall request one VFR straight in to a
     full stop with Live Oak.

     10.4.3. Inside Runway Closure. Sunfish will operate the T-6 VFR pattern on the center
     runway. No practice approaches or radar delays will be flown to the center runway during
     VFR pattern operations. T-6s should takeoff on the center runway. Aircraft shall hold for
     takeoff on the taxi line perpendicular to the center runway. Aircraft will provide enough
     room for T-1s and T-38Cs to taxi by to cross the center runway.
          10.4.3.1. During T-38 Recoveries, Live Oak will continue normal operations of the
          T-38C VFR pattern on the outside runway. T-1s will request one straight in to a full
          stop.

          10.4.3.2. When ATC tower controls the Outside Runway, minimize pattern time.

     10.4.4. Single Runway Operating Procedures. Takeoffs for local flying will be
     temporarily discontinued. If runway availability or fuel do not permit landing at CAFB,
     aircrew will divert. The SOF may direct Area Hold procedures (3.21.2.4). Aircrew will
     adjust Joker/Bingo fuels to land with 1200 lbs (T-38C/T-1), 350 lbs (T-6), or fuel to divert,
     whichever is higher. Solo students/team will be directed to full stop as soon as possible.

          10.4.4.1. Recovery Procedures With Both Overhead Patterns Open.

                10.4.4.1.1. Each aircraft will recover using normal procedures. All T-6s will
                utilize the Sunfish pattern ground track and frequency. T-38C or T-1 aircraft
                already operating in the pattern will continue in the pattern, while the other
                aircraft will approach via the center to a side-step/circle.

                10.4.4.1.2. Once established in the pattern, carry straight through initial.
                Report initial with 1,200/700 lbs and expect clearance from the Controller to
                break and land on the open runway. When flying the final turn, aircrew shall
                use caution for aircraft on initial.

          10.4.4.2. Recovery Procedures With Live Oak Pattern Closed.

                10.4.4.2.1. T-6s shall use procedures prescribed in 10.4.4.1.

                10.4.4.2.2. All T-38C/T-1s will recover via an instrument approach and shall
                expect to land, side-step, or circle to land on the open runway.

          10.4.4.3. Recovery with Both Overhead Patterns Closed. Recovery shall be via the
          VOR/DME A/B or vectors to an instrument approach. Aircrew shall expect to
          land/side-step/circle to land on the open runway.

10.5. Specialized Undergraduate Aircrew Training (SUPT) Student Solo Guidelines.

     10.5.1. All guidelines are based on the current syllabi of the base and are subject to
     change. Guidelines are not mandatory. They exist to provide a baseline for coordination
     with RAPCON, tower and the flying squadrons. Emergency aircraft are always allowed to
     conduct operations for safe recovery.

     10.5.2. T-6 Solo Restrictions.

          10.5.2.1. Solo students will not fly actual or simulated instrument approaches.
          10.5.2.2. Solo students will not fly in IMC and should ask for deviations around
          weather from ATC.

          10.5.2.3. Solo students are only authorized to fly ELP’s from High or Low Key at
          Columbus AFB or Gunshy Aux Field during actual emergencies.

          10.5.2.4. Solo students will not fly straight-in approaches, ELPs or no-flap patterns
          and landings.

          10.5.2.5. Solo students are limited to a maximum crosswind limit (to include gusts)
          of 15 knots.

     10.5.3. T-38 SUPT Solo Restrictions.

          10.5.3.1. Solo students are limited to a maximum crosswind limit (to include gusts)
          of 15 knots (dry runway) or 10 knots (wet runway).

10.6. Airfield Operations Board. The AOB provides a forum for discussing, updating and
tracking various activities in support of the wing flying mission.

     10.6.1. The Base Airfield Operations Board meetings should be conducted at the following
     intervals: Jan–Mar = first quarter, conducted in April; Apr–Jun = second quarter, conducted
     in July; Jul–Sep = third quarter, conducted in October; Oct–Dec = fourth quarter,
     conducted in January. The AOB shall convene at least once per quarter. The following is a
     list of minimum appointees to the AOB. Members may designate a representative to attend
     in his/her place.
