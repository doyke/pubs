     1.1.8. Makes all lodging arrangements for DVs based on host agency needs as indicated
     on the AETC IMT 88, AETC Distinguished Visitor Notification. The AETC IMT 88 is
     prescribed by AETC Instruction 90-401, Notification of Distinguished Visitors to AETC
     Installations. Refer to this AETC Instruction for further information on how to fill out
     the AETC IMT 88.
         1.1.8.1. The AU Commander’s Policy for DV lodging (Brett Hall) is as follows:
             1.1.8.1.1. Distinguished Visitors on official visits with a DV Code of 1-6 will
             receive priority lodging.
                 1.1.8.1.1.1. Distinguished Visitor’s aide and security will be lodged in Brett
                 Hall when possible. Additional members of the official party will be lodged
                 in closest proximity based on availability.
             1.1.8.1.2. Space Available (Space-A) visitors will be lodged in accordance with

  1.2. Other AU Organizations and Maxwell AFB Tenants, including those on Gunter Annex.
  Serve as OPR for agency-initiated distinguished visits, if purpose of DV’s visit is to present a
  lecture to an AU school or organization. If more than one agency is subsequently added to a
  DV itinerary, the agency initiating the invitation continues to act as the OPR, coordinating
  with each OCR involved in the visit. Exceptions to this policy will be coordinated with the
  Chief of Air University Protocol.
  1.3. Office of Primary Responsibility:
     1.3.1. Notifies AU Protocol of all distinguished visitors.
     1.3.2. Plans, coordinates, and executes visits and events.
     1.3.3. Serves as OCR for AU orientation visits when applicable.
     1.3.4. Updates the AU Consolidated DV Tracker on Air University Protocol SharePoint
     Site (discussed in paragraph 6) with potential DVs as far in advance as possible so that
     schools and organizations have visibility of the visit.
 4                                                                      AUI34-1201 9 JULY 2012


        1.3.5. Completes an AETC IMT 88, as shown at Attachment 2, for any DV Code 6 and
        above and e-mails it to AU Protocol (AU/CCP DV Request Org Mailbox) as soon as
        initial notification of a visit is received, but no later than (NLT) 1600 on the Monday
        before the week the DV arrives. Refer to the Department of the Air Force Protocol
        Precedence List link provided on the Air University Protocol SharePoint Site to
        determine appropriate DV Code. If there is any question regarding the proper DV code
        for an incoming guest, contact AU Protocol for further guidance. NOTE: AETC IMT 88
        must be accomplished on all DVs visiting Maxwell AFB regardless of which
        organization they are visiting and whether or not they remain overnight.
        1.3.6. Prepares a detailed itinerary (example itinerary templates are located on the AU
        Protocol SharePoint Site) for every DV visit. Coordinates itinerary and provides
        preliminary information to those agencies involved in the visit in a timely manner. Draft
        itineraries should be uploaded to the AU Protocol SharePoint Site NLT 2 weeks prior to
        the visit if possible and updated as necessary. Ensure AU Protocol and all affected
        agencies are notified of any updates. Only those units submitting the itineraries will have
        editing rights. NOTE: Itineraries should be marked ―FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.‖ It
        is understood that often arrival and departure times and other details are unknown until
        very close to the arrival. For senior leadership visibility, however, it is critical to upload
        the itineraries as soon as possible, keeping them current as conditions change.
     1.4. International Visitors. There is specific Air Force guidance with regard to foreign visits.
     Any agency receiving requests or direct notification of a proposed visit by an international
     visitor should redirect the inquiry to the Director, International Affairs (HQ AU/IA), in
     accordance with AUI 16-102, International Programs, paragraph 4.1. Make no commitment
     on the part of AU until HQ AU/IA and AU Protocol have approved. It is the AU
     Commander’s desire to have organizational briefings translated and presented to foreign
     guests in their native tongue when at all possible. Resources within the Maxwell AFB—
     through faculty, students, and other permanent party members—are often available to assist
     in accomplishing this goal, which is one more part of what has become ―The Maxwell
     Standard‖.
     1.5. Unexpected Guests. Occasionally, an unanticipated distinguished visitor will arrive at
     Maxwell Base Operations. Normally the command post learns of the arrival through the
     receipt of a flight plan or actual landing at Maxwell AFB. The 42d Air Base Wing
     Command Post notifies the AU Protocol On-Call Officer. The On-Call Officer should report
     to Base Operations to greet DV and provide assistance as necessary.
     1.6. AU Commander’s Expectations & Greeter Preferences: The AU Commander expects
     all personnel to meet the highest standards for all distinguished visitors and ceremonies.
     AU/CC’s most current preferences are located on the AU/CCP SharePoint site.
2. Official Ceremonies and Events – Duties and Responsibilities.
     2.1. AU Protocol:
        2.1.1. Serves as OPR for retirement and change of command of the Air University
        Commander. Serves as OCR for other official ceremonies and events officiated and
        hosted by the AU Commander or other senior officials. Exceptions to this policy will be
        at the discretion of the Chief of Protocol, Air University.
AUI34-1201 9 JULY 2012                                                                           5


      2.1.2. Provides guidance to AU agencies and organizations on official ceremonies and
      events.
      2.1.3. Attends pre-ceremony and event planning meetings, as necessary, and offers
      assistance as required or requested.
      2.1.4. Furnishes sample script, sequence of events, invitation, DV Pass, layout, program,
      or other materials as requested by organization serving as OPR.
      2.1.5. Reviews all ceremony and event materials before AU Commander coordination
      and approval.
   2.2. Other AU Organizations and Maxwell AFB Tenants, including those on Gunter Annex:
      2.2.1. Serve as OPR for official ceremonies and events, including those officiated and
      hosted by AU Commander, which are either held at or in honor of a member of their
      organization or unit.
      2.2.2. Notify AU Protocol as soon as possible of date and time for official ceremony or
      event. AU Protocol will serve as OCR and, as required, assign a Project Officer to work
      with organization, unit project officer, or planning committee.
3. Official Representation Funds (ORF).
   3.1. Background. The Air Force uses Official Representation Funds (ORF) to uphold the
   standing and prestige of the United States by extending official courtesies to certain officials
   and dignitaries of the United States and foreign countries. Accordingly, AU Protocol
   maintains the AU Commander’s Official Representation Fund (ORF), which is budgeted on a
   fiscal year basis. The AU Commander is the only person on Maxwell AFB who can
   authorize the use of these funds and is referred to as the designated authority.
   3.2. Policy. AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds, governs the use of ORF and should
   be referred to for guidance on authorized and unauthorized expenditures of ORF.
   3.3. Annual Budget Input. In February of each fiscal year, AU Protocol prepares an Official
   Representation Fund Spending Plan for the upcoming fiscal year and submits it to
   HQ AU/FM for HQ AETC approval.
   3.4. Requesting ORF Expenditure and Obligation of Budgeted Funds. Refer to AFI 65-603
   before submitting a request to expend or obligate ORF to determine the legality or propriety
   of the request. If there is any question about the appropriateness of the expenditure, AU
   Protocol personnel will contact AU/FM to obtain guidance on the request. If the proposed
   expenditure is allowed, the following procedures apply:
      3.4.1. To request approval to spend Official Representation Funds, submit an AU Form
      53, Official Representation Funds Expenditure Request/Report (used when requesting
      contingency funds of any amount), to AU Protocol as soon as the requirement is known,
      but no later than 7 duty days before the visit or event requiring the expenditure. Circle
      ―Request‖ at the top of the form. All blocks on the AU Form 53 must be filled in or it
      will be returned to the submitting organization for correction. Refer to the sample and
      detailed instructions at Attachment 3 and Figure A3.1. Where applicable, include a
      proposed guest list with name and position or title of invitees. Proposed guest list should
      be broken out into DOD/Non-DOD categories (Attachment 4). Additionally, provide a
 6                                                                   AUI34-1201 9 JULY 2012


        list of any attendees not being paid for by ORFs. This list should also contain the name,
        title and whether they are DOD/Non-DOD. AU Protocol will route the AU Form 53 for
        approval and call the submitting office when approved. Make no purchase or
        commitment on the part of the government before receiving approval notification from
        AU Protocol. A Government Purchase Card (GPC) cardholder on the AU Protocol
        account may make purchases after notification that the AU Form 53 is approved. Those
        organizations that do not have a GPC cardholder on the AU Protocol account must make
        arrangements with an AU Protocol cardholder to make the purchase. Forty-eight-hour
        advance notice is required if AU Protocol will be required to make the purchase. Follow
        all applicable GPC purchase guidelines.
        3.4.2. AFI 65-603 requires that a report detailing final costs and actual attendees be
        submitted following events or visits involving ORF expenditures. To report ORF
        expenditures, submit an AU Form 53 to AU Protocol no later than 3 days following visit
        or event. Circle ―Report‖ at the top of the form. Refer to detailed instructions at
        Attachment 5 and Figure A5.1.
4. Special Morale and Welfare Funds (SM&W).
     4.1. When to use SM&W Funds. In certain instances, SM&W Funds are authorized when
     hosting visitors or conducting an official ceremony. Examples for authorized use are: light
     refreshments and flowers for spouse at promotion ceremonies; light refreshments and flowers
     for spouse at retirement ceremonies; mementos for Government personnel. Refer to AFI 34-
     201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFS), and the Commander’s Guide to Special Morale
     and Welfare Related Expenditures, published by HQ AETC/A1SR, for specific guidance.
     4.2. NAF Form 90. If SM&W funds are authorized, submit a NAF Form 90, Special Morale
     and Welfare (SM&W) Funding Request (used to request non-appropriated funds of any
     amount), to 42 FSS/FSR, 42 FSS/FSR will forward through the appropriate approval offices,
     including the final approval authority, 42 FSS/CC. When 42 FSS/CC has completed review
     and approved or disapproved the NAF Form 90, they will email/fax the submitting office a
     copy, or call the submitting office for pick-up. For specific guidance on submitting NAF
     Form 90 contact 42 FSS/FSR.
5. Air University Mementos. Air University Protocol maintains an inventory of ORF
(appropriated funds) and Special Morale and Welfare (SM&W) (Nonappropriated funds)
mementos for the Air University Commander’s use. When there is to be a memento exchange
during a visit, or it is deemed appropriate for the Air University Commander or his representative
to present a memento, the Project Officer or OPR will fill out an AU Form 21 (used when there
is to be a memento exchange during a DV visit) (see Attachment 7 and Figure A7.1) to request
memento(s). Once the AU Form 21 is approved by the Chief or Deputy Chief of Protocol, the
Air University Memento Custodian will pull the memento from the inventory and update all
records accordingly. If the memento needs to be returned to inventory, Project Officer or OPR
will fill out AU Form 21 (See Attachment 8 and Figure A8.1) to return the memento to the
appropriate inventory.
6. Air University Protocol Sharepoint Site. Air University’s dynamic protocol environment
drives innovation and a continuous effort to increase the quality and efficiency of processes and
products used when handling thousands of visitors each year. To that end, in an effort to provide
the latest AU/CC preferences, templates, and examples that will help project officers in their
AUI34-1201 9 JULY 2012                                                                         7


event or visit planning, AU Protocol has moved these items to its AU Protocol SharePoint® site
on Maxwell Intranet. It is here that POCs have a wide range of tools that will help in
preparations for ceremonies, visits, and other protocol events. These products will be updated on
a recurring basis by AU Protocol as required or when a better product is devised. AU
organizations are highly encouraged to visit and utilize the site.
