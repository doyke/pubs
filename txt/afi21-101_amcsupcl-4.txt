                KC-135/E/R/T DEBRIEFING CHECKLIST


                              INTRODUCTION


This debriefing checklist will be used as a guide to assist the maintenance
debriefer in ensuring that all pertinent information on a system malfunction is
included on the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
Document. This checklist is considered minimal and is not intended to replace
systems knowledge or common sense. The debriefer is charged with the
responsibility of questioning the aircrew to make sure that all symptoms of a
malfunction are known and recorded on the AFTO Form 781A. Remember this is
the only information the technician will have to determine the source of the
problem.
Forward recommended changes to this form through channels to HQ AMC/A4M.
I.    Instructions: Prior to debriefing:
             A.     The debriefing team members will review past debriefing
                    forms, logs, or files to acquaint themselves with any
                    previous repeat/recurring discrepancies.
             B.     The appropriate maintenance specialty should be
                    represented at the debriefing to help clarify discrepancies.
II.   Debriefing Procedures.
             A.     The debriefing team leader will take charge of the
                    debriefing and debrief the aircrew, utilizing this checklist
                    as a guide.
             B.     Review all AFTO Form 781A for the mission(s). Make
                    special note of repeated or recurring discrepancies.
             C.     Check AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight
                    Status and Maintenance for flight time(s), total landings,
                    sorties, the number of discrepancies, pilot’s signature and
                    servicing data.
             D.     Debrief all discrepancies as clearly as possible.
             E.     Identify and annotate discrepancies that require follow-on
                    action, i.e., reportable flight control malfunctions, dropped
                    objects, and in-flight incidents. Request required support
                    from appropriate agency.
             F.     Check adequacy of corrective action on all cleared
                    discrepancies. If necessary consult with the on-duty Pro-
                    Super and specialist to validate questionable corrective
                    actions. This should be the responsibility of the SMO,
                    Maintenance Superintendent, Pro-Super, Expeditor, and
                    lead technicians, not the debriefer.
             G.     Determine if aircraft was flown low level over salt water
                    and act as necessary to comply with T.O. 1-1-691, Aircraft
     Weapon System Cleaning and Corrosion Control.
H.   Ensure ALL locations where the aircraft stopped and was
     chemically disinfected for Foot and Mouth Disease are
     annotated by placing an entry in the 781A’s. Debriefers
     will document this information in G081 using screen 9050,
     with work unit code 02400 to create the Foot and Mouth
     Decontamination discrepancy; G081 will automatically
     enter the information in the aircraft history. Report this
     information electronically to HQ AMC/A4MJS; DSN 779-
     2622 / Commercial 618-229-2622. Due to the potentially
     damaging long-term effects of the decontamination on
     sensitive aircraft parts, accurate tracking is essential.
I.   Determine if aircraft was flown through predicted areas of
     low volcanic ash, an entry is made in the 781A’s.
     Debriefers will document this information in GO81 using
     screen XXXX, with work unit code XXXX to create the
     volcanic ash discrepancy; G081 will automatically enter
     this information in the aircraft history.
