                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope. This instruction outlines the procedures applicable to the safe operation of the UV-
18. Along with the complementary references cited, this instruction prescribes standard
operational procedures to be used by all pilots operating UV-18 aircraft. Units will provide local
operating procedures in a supplement to this publication.
1.2. Pilot’s Responsibility. In conjunction with other governing directives, this instruction
prescribes UV-18 procedures under most circumstances but is not to be used as a substitute for
sound judgment or common sense. The pilot in command (PIC) is ultimately responsible for the
safe and effective operation of the aircraft and will ensure all occupants of the aircraft comply
with this directive.
1.3. Deviations. Do not deviate from the procedures and guidance in this publication except
when necessary to preserve safety or protect lives. In that case, the PIC has ultimate authority
and responsibility for the course of action to be taken and will take the appropriate action to
safely recover the aircraft. Report all deviations without waiver through channels to the
MAJCOM OPR.
1.4. References. The primary references for UV-18 operations are this instruction and technical
order (TO) 1U-18(V)B-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, UV-18 Aircraft. Training units may
develop phase manuals from the procedures contained in these documents. Phase manuals may
be used to augment initial and mission qualification training. They may expand these basic
procedures but will not be less restrictive. Only maneuvers described in these references will be
flown.
1.5. Waivers. Except where noted, the MAJCOM A3 is the waiver authority for this
instruction. Submit waiver requests to the OPR.
1.6. Crew Requirements:
     1.6.1. The normal crew for the UV-18 aircraft is two qualified pilots, one of which must be
     aircraft commander certified in accordance with AFI 11-2UV-18, Volume 1, UV-18 Aircrew
     Training. Exception: Single-pilot operations with an instructor pilot (IP) may be authorized
     by the operations group (OG) commander.
     1.6.2. Parachuting operations require a fully qualified jumpmaster (JM) in accordance with
     AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations, and MAJCOM guidance. The JM may
     perform a proficiency jump after all other jumpers have left the aircraft or in the last
     formation exiting the aircraft.
1.7. Maximum Flight Duty Period Flight Time. AFI 11-202, Volume 3, lists maximum flight
duty periods.
     1.7.1. For normal operations, consider the UV-18 as a utility type aircraft.
     1.7.2. When all missions in the flight duty period involve only point-to-point movement of
     the aircraft or passengers (no parachuting activities planned or performed), the UV-18 may
     be considered as a transport type aircraft.
AFI11-2UV-18V3 3 JANUARY 2012                                                                  5


   1.7.3. Use of additional crewmembers to extend the flight duty period (augmented crew) is
   not authorized.
1.8. Clothing Requirements. AFI 11-301, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program,
prescribes minimum aircrew clothing requirements. In the absence of specific guidance, all
aircrew members will wear flight suits and flight boots while operating the aircraft.
   1.8.1. Aircrew will carry flight gloves and appropriate seasonal flight clothing. Aircrew
   members will remove rings and scarves before performing aircrew duties.
   1.8.2. Aircrew will wear flight gloves during the exterior inspection and during critical
   phases of flight.
1.9. Seatbelts and Shoulder Harnesses:
   1.9.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seatbelt.
   1.9.2. All crewmembers will wear seatbelts at all times while operating the aircraft. Aircrews
   will wear seatbelt and shoulder harnesses during critical phases of flight.
   1.9.3. Passengers will remain seated with seatbelts fastened during taxi, takeoff, landing,
   below 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL), and any other time as determined by the PIC.
   (Exceptions: During taxi, the designated passenger monitor paragraph 3.11 may remove his
   or her seatbelt to handle unusual passenger situations. The passenger monitor will normally
   inform the pilot when removing the seatbelt is required. Designated JMs may remove their
   seatbelts above 500 AGL or power cutback, whichever occurs first, to perform required
   passenger cabin duties.)
   1.9.4. When the air operable cargo (Lexan) door is open, passengers without a parachute will
   remain seated with their seatbelts fastened or be secured to the aircraft by an approved
   restraining device.
1.10. Oxygen Requirements. The PIC will ensure oxygen is supplied to passengers according
to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and AFI 11-409, High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support Program.
1.11. Cargo Restrictions:
   1.11.1. Transportation of pets is not authorized.
   1.11.2. Transportation of hazardous cargo is not authorized except as follows:
      1.11.2.1. Only hazard class and division 1.4G (moderate fire, no blast) smoke grenades

                                            Chapter 2

                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The individual pilots and the operations functions of the organizations
jointly share responsibility of mission planning. The PIC is ultimately responsible for mission
planning.
2.2. General Procedures. The aircrew will:
   2.2.1. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment. AFI 11-
   202, Volume 3, specifies minimum requirements.
   2.2.2. Compute takeoff and landing data for each flight. MAJCOM-approved tabulated data
   may be used when available.
   2.2.3. Calculate single-engine service ceiling for flight over mountainous terrain and:
       2.2.3.1. On an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, only operate the aircraft along
       routes where the single-engine service ceiling exceeds the minimum IFR altitude as
       defined by AFI 11-202, Volume 3. Note: The minimum IFR altitude provides 2,000 feet
       of terrain clearance in designated mountainous terrain.
       2.2.3.2. On a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan, will not intentionally plan or fly a
       route over actual terrain less than 1,000 feet below the single-engine service ceiling. For
       example, if single-engine service ceiling is calculated to be 14,000 feet mean sea level
       (MSL), pilots may not plan or fly over terrain higher than 13,000 feet MSL.
   2.2.4. Ensure all passengers are manifested in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
2.3. Briefings and Debriefings. The PIC is responsible for presenting a logical briefing that
will promote safe, effective mission accomplishment. All pilots will attend the flight briefing.
The PIC will structure the flight briefing to accommodate the capabilities of each pilot in the
flight. Copilots, JMs, and passengers will be briefed on their specific duties and responsibilities
related to safe mission accomplishment to include in-flight discipline. JM briefing requirements
are specified in AFI 11-410.
   2.3.1. Minimum Briefing Times. Begin briefings at least 30 minutes (single-ship) or one
   hour (formation) before scheduled takeoff. On subsequent flights with the same crew on the
   same day, the PIC must brief only those items that have changed from the previous flights.
   2.3.2. Briefing Guides:
       2.3.2.1. Aircrews will refer to the appropriate briefing guides located in Attachment 2
       and Attachment 3, and brief applicable items before each mission. Note: Briefing guides
       are reference lists of items that may apply to particular missions. The flight manual
       contains the passenger briefing guide.
       2.3.2.2. Items listed may be briefed in any sequence. Those items covered by written
       squadron standards and understood by all participants may be briefed as standard. Each
       guide may be expanded as necessary to cover other important items of the flight. Brief
       only those items applicable to the particular mission and in sufficient detail to prevent
       any misunderstanding between crewmembers.
 8                                                          AFI11-2UV-18V3 3 JANUARY 2012


     2.3.3. Alternate Missions. If applicable, brief an alternate mission for each flight.
2.4. Maps and Charts. A local sectional and VFR terminal area charts (class B airspace) must
be on board the aircraft. When flying outside the local area, charts covering the route of flight
must be on board the aircraft. These charts must be appropriate for the type of mission flown.
2.5. Required Documents. The following documents must be on board for flight:
     2.5.1. Aircraft weight and balance.
     2.5.2. Airworthiness certificate.
     2.5.3. Aircraft registration.
     2.5.4. AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
     2.5.5. Passenger manifest, if required (according to AFI 11-202, Volume 3).
     2.5.6. TO 1U-18(V)B-1.
     2.5.7. TO 1U-18(V)B-1CL-1, Pilots Abbreviated Flight Crew Checklist, USAF Series UV-
     18B Aircraft.
     2.5.8. A unit-developed pilot aid according to paragraph 2.6.2 of this instruction.
2.6. Unit-Developed Checklists and Pilot Aids:
     2.6.1. According to AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP), when aircrew use
     unit-developed checklists in lieu of flight manual checklists, the checklists must contain, as a
     minimum, all items (verbatim and in order) listed in the applicable flight manual checklist.
     Crewmembers will still carry a current flight manual checklist and have it immediately
     available on all flights.
     2.6.2. Unit-developed pilot aids will include as a minimum, the following items:
        2.6.2.1. Briefing guides.
        2.6.2.2. Local radio frequencies.
        2.6.2.3. Appropriate airfield diagrams, including aircraft arresting systems.
        2.6.2.4. Emergency information, including impoundment procedures, emergency action
        checklists, lost communications procedures, and divert information.
        2.6.2.5. Cross-country procedures, including command and control, aircraft security, and
        aircraft servicing.
        2.6.2.6. Local training areas.

3.1. Preflight:
   3.1.1. Required Equipment:
       3.1.1.1. An operable flashlight is required for all night operations.
       3.1.1.2. Crews remaining off-station overnight will carry chocks, engine intake covers,
       propeller locks, tiedown straps, pitot tube covers, and a key to lock the doors.
   3.1.2. Aircraft Systems. Chapter 4 specifies the minimum equipment list.
       3.1.2.1. High Wind Exposure Inspection. The aircraft requires maintenance inspection
       prior to flight if it has been subjected to high wind or jet blast according to the following:
           3.1.2.1.1. With gust locks disengaged:
              3.1.2.1.1.1. Winds with a mean velocity equal to or greater than 30 knots from
              any direction.
              3.1.2.1.1.2. Jet blast from any direction.

              to 90 degrees of aircraft nose-into-wind position.
              3.1.2.1.2.3. Winds with a mean velocity equal to or greater than 30 knots from
              any other direction.
              3.1.2.1.2.4. Jet blast from any direction. Note: A mean wind speed of 30 knots
              may involve occasional gusts in excess of 50 knots.
       3.1.2.2. Instrument Cockpit Check. Complete an instrument cockpit check prior to
       initial takeoff on every sortie. Exception: An instrument cockpit check is not required
       when no instrument approaches are planned during a day local sortie.
   3.1.3. Foreign Object Damage (FOD). To reduce the risk of FOD and personal injury
   during ground operations, personnel will:
       3.1.3.1. Not approach an operating engine.
       3.1.3.2. Avoid using excessive power, especially when backing.
       3.1.3.3. Avoid prop or jet blast from other aircraft.
       3.1.3.4. Ensure loose items are secure in the cockpit before opening the doors or
       windows.
   3.1.4. Minimum Runway Condition Reading (RCR).
 10                                                       AFI11-2UV-18V3 3 JANUARY 2012


      3.1.4.1. Do not operate the aircraft with an RCR less than 6, with braking action poor, or
      when the runway surface condition is “ice on runway.” Note: A runway surface condition
      reported as patchy (runway less than fully covered) is not restrictive when adequate
      unaffected runway is available.
      3.1.4.2. Do not take off or land when the RCR is less than or equal to the crosswind
      component (steady state or gust).
      3.1.4.3. Consult the flight information handbook’s RCR correlation chart for adjustments
      to landing distance with RCR below “dry.” (Flight information handbook located at the
      National                                                         Geospatial-Intelligence
      Agency:https://aero.geointel.nga.mil/products/digitalaero/flip.cfm after an account is
      established at https://www.extranet.nga.mil/servlet/ShowHomepage.) (Note: With
      braking action poor or RCR below 6, landing distance could be doubled, potentially
      exceeding 3,000 feet.)
3.2. Ground and Taxi Operations:
   3.2.1. Refueling Operations. Personnel not actively involved in refueling will remain at
   least 50 feet away from an aircraft refueling operation. In addition, do not operate the engine,
   taxi, or radiate electromagnetic energy (radio, distance measuring equipment [DME], cell
   phones, or transponder operation) within the 50-foot safety zone.
   3.2.2. Visual Signals. Pilots will ensure systems that could pose any danger to the ground
   crew are not activated before receiving proper acknowledgment from ground personnel.
   When ground intercom is not used, visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-218,
   Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground, and this instruction. The ground crew will
   repeat the given signal when it is safe to operate the system.
   3.2.3. Aircraft Start. The PIC will:
      3.2.3.1. Not start the engines without a fireguard. If an external fireguard is not available,
      a crewmember will act as the fireguard.
      3.2.3.2. Not allow an individual who is not qualified or not in training leading to
      qualification to start engines or taxi the aircraft.
      3.2.3.3. Ensure the area around the propellers is clear and that all passengers are properly
      seated before starting engines.
   3.2.4. Minimum Spacing and Taxi Interval. Comply with the minimum taxi clearances in
   AFI 11-218. In addition:
      3.2.4.1. UV-18 formations will taxi with a minimum of 100 feet (staggered) or 250 feet
      (in trail).
      3.2.4.2. Maintain at least 100 feet of spacing behind single-engine light aircraft.
      3.2.4.3. Maintain at least 250 feet of spacing behind multi-engine or jet aircraft.
      3.2.4.4. Maintain a minimum of 500 feet behind taxiing helicopters.
   3.2.5. Wind Limitations. Ground operations will not be conducted when surface winds
   exceed 35 knots (steady state or gusting).
AFI11-2UV-18V3 3 JANUARY 2012                                                                  11


   3.2.6. Taxi Speed. Maximum taxi speed is 25 knots. Taxi across any lowered web barriers
   below the maximum taxi speed.
   3.2.7. Reverse Taxi. Reverse taxi will only be accomplished by certified crewmembers.
   Use a marshaller or spotters to clear the area behind the aircraft during reverse taxi.
   3.2.8. Engine Runup:
      3.2.8.1. Full engine runups are required only on the first flight of the day.
      3.2.8.2. The pilot not flying (PNF) will guard the brakes during static engine runup
      checks to prevent undetected aircraft movement and remain vigilant for other traffic.
   3.2.9. Crew Seat Changes. Crew seat changes on the ground will not be done with the
   engines running unless there is a pilot (or engine run qualified maintenance specialist) at the
   controls at all times to guard the brakes. Seat changes with only two crewmembers on board
   will not be done with the engines running.
   3.2.10. Engine Running On-Load/Off-Load (ERO). EROs may be accomplished with
   squadron commander approval. Units will provide specific ERO guidance.
3.3. Takeoff and Landing:
   3.3.1. Runway:
      3.3.1.1. The minimum runway required for normal UV-18 operations (takeoff or
      landing) is 3,000 by 40 feet of useable, hard surface. Do not consider runway prior to
      above-ground aircraft arresting cables as useable for takeoff. Do not consider runway
      after above-ground aircraft arresting cables as useable for landing, but it is available for
      taxi. The OG commander may approve operations on shorter runways when the takeoff
      and landing distances do not exceed 80 percent of the useable runway.
      3.3.1.2. Do not takeoff over a raised web barrier unless the minimum runway and the
      planned rate of climb will clear the barrier by 35 feet.
      3.3.1.3. Intersection takeoffs are approved as long as the useable runway remaining is
      3,000 feet or greater. When aircrews use less than the entire runway for takeoff, base
      takeoff data calculations on the actual runway remaining from the point where takeoff
      starts.
   3.3.2. Gross Weight. The maximum gross weight for takeoff must not exceed 12,500
   pounds.
   3.3.3. Minimum Rate of Climb:
      3.3.3.1. For VFR departures, ensure a positive single-engine rate of climb.

      Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures.
   3.3.4. Weather Requirements:
      3.3.4.1. For an IFR takeoff, existing weather must be at or above compatible IFR landing
      minimums at the departure airfield.
      3.3.4.2. For IFR landings, pilots will use a 200-foot ceiling and 1/2-mile visibility
      (runway visual range of 2,400 feet) or published minimums (whichever is higher) to
 12                                                       AFI11-2UV-18V3 3 JANUARY 2012


       determine IFR landing minimums. Exception: An IP may fly approaches to published
       approach minimums. When an IP is at a set of controls, the crew may fly approaches to
       the IP’s minimums.
   3.3.5. Minimum Runway Spacing. Reduced same runway separation is authorized in
   accordance with AFI 13-204, Volume 3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs.
   3.3.6. Crosswind Limitations. The maximum crosswind limit for takeoff and landing is 23
   knots for IPs and 18 knots for all other pilots. Pilots will use the maximum crosswind
   (including gusts) to determine if winds exceed pilot or aircraft limits for takeoff or landing.
   3.3.7. Touch-And-Go Landings. Do not perform touch-and-go landings with the air
   operable cargo (Lexan) door open.
   3.3.8. Flaps:
       3.3.8.1. Perform takeoffs using 10 degrees of flaps except during no-flap takeoff
       demonstrations when required by a training syllabus.
       3.3.8.2. Full-flap landings will only be flown to a full stop or a stop-and-go.
3.4. Fuel Requirements. Declare minimum fuel or emergency fuel to the controlling agency
any time it becomes apparent an aircraft will land at the base of intended landing (or alternate if
required) with less than the required fuel reserve.
   3.4.1. With 300 pounds or less, declare minimum fuel.
   3.4.2. With 200 pounds or less, declare emergency fuel.
3.5. Minimum Altitudes:
   3.5.1. Perform all portions of stalls, slow flight, unusual attitude recoveries, abnormal flight
   recoveries, minimum controllable airspeed demonstrations, and formation confidence
   maneuvering exercises above 2,000 feet AGL.
   3.5.2. The minimum altitude for parachute operations is 2,500 feet AGL.
   3.5.3. Only practice formation lost wingman procedures above 2,000 feet AGL.
   3.5.4. The minimum altitude for in-flight propeller feathering demonstrations is 2,000 feet
   AGL.

   required for obstacle clearance.
   3.5.6. The minimum altitude for seat changes is 1,000 feet AGL. Change seats only during a
   noncritical phase of flight.
3.6. In-Flight Weather Requirements:
   3.6.1. If lightning or thunderstorms are reported within 10 nautical miles (nm) of the area of
   operation, ensure the aircraft is not exposed to hail, lightning, windshear, or microbursts.
   Cease jump operations and traffic pattern operations with lightning within 5 nm.
   3.6.2. Without weather radar (Table 4.1):
       3.6.2.1. Maintain visual meteorological conditions (VMC) in areas of forecast
       thunderstorms.
AFI11-2UV-18V3 3 JANUARY 2012                                                                13


       3.6.2.2. Flight into areas of actual thunderstorms is prohibited.
   3.6.3. Flight into areas of known or forecast icing conditions greater than moderate is
   prohibited.

   3.7.5. Minimum controllable airspeed demonstrations.
   3.7.6. Touch-and-go landings.
   3.7.7. Full-flap landings.
3.8. Instrument and Navigation Procedures:
   3.8.1. IFR Departure Planning. Aircrews will comply with the departure planning
   guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 3. Use of special departure procedures to meet one-engine
   climb performance requirements is not authorized.
   3.8.2. Approach Category. To determine instrument approach minimums, pilots will
   consider the UV-18 a category “A” aircraft. Exception: When circling requires an approach
   flown above 90 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), higher category minimums apply.
   3.8.3. Global Positioning System (GPS). Two GPS systems are available for use in the
   UV-18.
       3.8.3.1. The Chelton Flight Logic electronic flight instrumentation system (EFIS)-SV
       EFIS equipment using the Chelton Flight Systems (CFS) Beta-3 GPS/WAAS receiver is
       certified in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Technical Standard
       Order (TSO) C-146a, Stand-alone Airborne Navigation Equipment Using the Global
       Positioning System (GPS) Augmented by the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).
       The EFIS meets the requirements of RTCA DO-229C, Minimum Operational
       Performance Standards for Global Positioning System/Wide Area Augmentation System
       Airborne Equipment, Class Gamma 1.
           3.8.3.1.1. This equipment complies with FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 20-138a,
           Airworthiness Approval of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Equipment, for
           navigation using GPS and WAAS (including “GPS”, “or GPS”, and “area navigation
 14                                                      AFI11-2UV-18V3 3 JANUARY 2012


          (RNAV)” approaches), and approach procedures with vertical guidance (including
          “LNAV/VNAV” and localizer performance with vertical guidance [“LPV”]). Based
          on compliance with TSO C146a, this equipment also complies with FAA AC 90-
          100a, U.S. Terminal and En Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations, for
          navigation on (U.S. RNAV routes), (Q-routes and T-routes), departure procedures,
          and standard terminal arrivals.
          3.8.3.1.2. Approved instrument approaches (with an asterisk in the database) may be
          flown to LNAV, LNAV/VNAV, or LPV minimums when WAAS or fault detection
          and exclusion (FDE) is available (no GPS caution flags displayed) and such
          minimums are published. In actual IMC, GPS instrument approaches will not
          continue beyond the final approach fix when WAAS or FDE is not available.
      3.8.3.2. The Bendix King KLN 90B GPS is considered a mission enhancement system
      IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and is approved for VFR en route operations only.
   3.8.4. Vertical Navigation (VNAV) Systems. Use of the CFS GPS/WAAS VNAV
   functions is approved for IFR during en route, terminal area, and nonprecision approach
   operations. This system is certified in accordance with FAA TSO C-146a. Instrument
   approaches are restricted to no lower than LNAV minimums when vertical deviation
   symbology is not displayed.
   3.8.5. Simulated Instrument Flight. Use of vision restricting devices to simulate
   instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) is not authorized.
   3.8.6. Holding Airspeed. Use 120 KIAS (two-engine) or 100 KIAS (single-engine) for
   holding.
3.9. Night Procedures:
   3.9.1. Aircrews will ensure that all required exterior and interior lights are operational.
   Perform an instrument cockpit check prior to all night flying.
   3.9.2. The landing lights may be used to provide additional illumination for taxi.
   3.9.3. Aircrews will only perform 10 degree flap takeoffs.
   3.9.4. For all night operations, do not file to a destination other than a home station unless
   there is an operable straight-in approach with glidepath guidance. A visual descent path
   indicator, precision approach guidance system, or GPS/WAAS VNAV guidance from a
   published RNAV (GPS) approach constitutes acceptable glidepath guidance.
3.10. Formation Procedures:
   3.10.1. Maximum Size. The maximum formation size is three aircraft. Larger formations
   and dissimilar formations require OG commander approval.
   3.10.2. Lead Change:
      3.10.2.1. Do not initiate a lead change unless the aircraft assuming the lead is in a
      position from which the lead change can be safely initiated and visual contact maintained.
      3.10.2.2. The minimum altitude for a lead change within a formation is 500 feet AGL.
   3.10.3. Takeoff:
AFI11-2UV-18V3 3 JANUARY 2012                                                                 15


     3.10.3.1. Minimum interval between aircraft on a formation takeoff is 15 seconds with
     the previous aircraft airborne.
     3.10.3.2. A two-ship echelon lineup requires a runway greater than 80 feet wide.
     3.10.3.3. A three-ship echelon lineup requires a runway greater than 120 feet wide.
     3.10.3.4. When the runway width prevents echelon lineup, line up in trail with 300 feet
     of spacing minimum between aircraft. If runway length precludes lining up with spacing
     on the runway, the wingmen will remain clear of the runway until the previous aircraft
     has started takeoff roll.
  3.10.4. Approach and Landing. Formation approaches and landings are not authorized.
  (Exception: When an aircraft malfunction requires a chase aircraft, the minimum altitude for
  the chase aircraft is 500 feet AGL.)
  3.10.5. Formation Maneuvers:
     3.10.5.1. In pre-jump position, limit maneuvering to approximately 30 degrees of bank
     or 10 degrees of pitch (up or down).
     3.10.5.2. In route position, the maximum bank angle is 45 degrees.
     3.10.5.3. In echelon position, the maximum bank angle is 45 degrees.
     3.10.5.4. In jump position, the minimum spacing between aircraft during jump
     operations is 100 feet lateral spacing and 150 feet vertical spacing. Limit maneuvering to
     approximately 20 degrees of bank.
     3.10.5.5. When an unusual situation requires a chase aircraft, the chase aircraft will fly
     no closer than route position unless required for observation of the supported aircraft.
  3.10.6. Lost Wingman Procedures. Formation flight into weather conditions other than
  VMC is not authorized.
     3.10.6.1. Wingman Procedures (Number Two). If the formation inadvertently enters
     weather and the number two loses sight of the leader, the wingman will simultaneously
     transition to instruments, inform lead, and perform the following procedures:
         3.10.6.1.1. If the formation is in straight flight (climbing, descending or level), turn
         away from lead using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds. Then, reverse the turn to
         resume the previous course. Obtain a separate clearance, if required.
         3.10.6.1.2. If the formation is turning (climbing, descending or level) and the
         wingman is:
             3.10.6.1.2.1. Outside the turn, reverse the direction of the turn using 15 degrees
             bank for 15 seconds. Then, roll out and continue straight ahead to ensure
             separation before resuming the turn.
             3.10.6.1.2.2. Inside the turn, momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail
             separation and inform lead to roll out of the turn. Maintain angle of bank to ensure
             lateral separation. Lead may resume the turn only when separation is ensured.
 16                                                       AFI11-2UV-18V3 3 JANUARY 2012


      3.10.6.2. Wingman Procedures (Number Three). If the formation inadvertently enters
      the weather and number three loses sight, the wingman will simultaneously transition to
      instruments, inform lead, and perform the following procedures:
          3.10.6.2.1. If the formation is in straight flight (climbing, descending, or level), turn
          away from lead using 30 degrees of bank for 30 seconds. Then, reverse the turn to
          resume the previous course. Obtain a separate clearance, if required.
          3.10.6.2.2. If the formation is turning (climbing, descending, or level) and the
          wingman is:
              3.10.6.2.2.1. Outside the turn, reverse the direction of the turn using 30 degrees
              bank for 30 seconds. Then, roll out and continue straight ahead to ensure
              separation before resuming the turn.
              3.10.6.2.2.2. Inside the turn, momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail
              separation and inform lead to roll out of the turn. Increase angle of bank by 15
              degrees to ensure lateral separation. Lead may resume the turn only when
              separation is ensured.
      3.10.6.3. Lead Procedures. Lead will immediately perform the appropriate procedure,
      acknowledge the lost wingman's radio call, and transmit lead's aircraft attitude which the
      wingman will acknowledge. Lead should transmit other parameters such as heading,
      altitude, and airspeed as necessary to aid in maintaining safe separation. Air traffic
      control (ATC) may also assist in ensuring positive separation.
   3.10.7. Knock-It-Off (KIO) Procedures. Any flight member may make a “knock it off”
   call to terminate maneuvering. When a dangerous situation is developing, flight members
   will be directive first. All participants will acknowledge a KIO by repeating the call.
   Aircrews will use KIO procedures to terminate maneuvering when a dangerous situation is
   developing. It may also be used when training is complete.
3.11. Passenger Transport Procedures:
   3.11.1. When carrying passengers, the PIC will designate an additional crewmember or a JM
   as a passenger (PAX) monitor. The PAX monitor will:
      3.11.1.1. Ensure all passengers are briefed according to the TO 1U-18(V)B-1CL-1
      passenger briefing guide.
      3.11.1.2. Remain on headset unless authorized to remove the headset by the PIC.
      3.11.1.3. Give passengers directions during emergencies.
   3.11.2. If no jump operations are planned, the air operable cargo door (Lexan) will remain
   closed.
   3.11.3. When the Lexan door is open, passengers without a parachute will remain seated
   with their seatbelts fastened or be secured to the aircraft by an approved restraining device.
   3.11.4. If passengers remain on board after all jumpers have left the aircraft:
      3.11.4.1. A qualified JM or an additional aircrew passenger will ensure the Lexan door is
      closed and secured, and will land with the aircraft. Exception: If all remaining
AFI11-2UV-18V3 3 JANUARY 2012                                                                 17


      passengers are JMs, rated aircrew, or career enlisted aviators, the Lexan door may remain
      open for landing with all passengers seated and their seatbelts fastened.
      3.11.4.2. Coordinate with the JM or additional aircrew passenger to ensure all
      appropriate automatic activation devices (AAD) are off and all passengers are secure for
      landing. Do not exceed a 1,000 feet per minute descent rate until all appropriate AADs
      are turned off.
      3.11.4.3. The aircrew will plan for the additional weight when returning to land with
      passengers on board.
3.12. Simulated Emergency Procedures: (Note: Practice no-flap landings are not emergency
procedures.)
   3.12.1. IP will brief all airborne simulated emergencies before flight.
   3.12.2. Conduct simulated emergency training only during day VMC.
   3.12.3. Do not practice simulated emergencies in-flight without an operable interphone.
   3.12.4. Do not practice compound or multiple simulated emergencies in-flight.
   3.12.5. Do not practice simulated emergency procedures with jumpers on board.
   3.12.6. Do not compound simulated single-engine circling approaches or low closed patterns
   with any other simulated malfunctions.
   3.12.7. Fly all simulated single-engine landings to a full stop or stop-and-go landing. During
   simulated single-engine landings, IPs will ensure both prop levers are returned to full
   increase prior to crossing the runway threshold. Pilots will not select reverse thrust during
   landing roll.
   3.12.8. IPs will ensure the aircraft does not descend below 300 feet AGL during practice
   single-engine go-arounds.
3.13. Nontowered Airfield (NTA) Operations:
   3.13.1. With the OG commander’s approval, aircrews may conduct operations at
   nontowered, public- use airfields as follows:
      3.13.1.1. Night NTA operations require operations supervisor approval.
      3.13.1.2. Formation NTA operations require operations supervisor approval. Night
      formation NTA operations are not authorized.
      3.13.1.3. Winds must be within limits for each runway to which the aircrew operates as
      best as can be determined with available information.
      3.13.1.4. In the event a landing is required at an NTA, the unit will ensure fire or crash
      recovery (according to AFPAM 32-2004, Aircraft Fire Protection for Military
      Operations Other Than War (MOOTW)) and maintenance personnel, as appropriate to
      the situation, are available for the subsequent launch.
      3.13.1.5. Aircrews will monitor the published common traffic advisory frequency and
      make all radio calls and position reports recommended in the Aeronautical Information
      Manual                      (AIM)                    (available                    at:
      http://www.faa.gov/airports_airtraffic/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/).

      3.13.1.6. Instrument approaches, rectangular patterns (as depicted in the AIM), and
      emergency procedures may be flown. Do not fly overhead patterns.
      3.13.1.7. Fly instrument approaches under an IFR clearance, unless waived in
      accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
      3.13.1.8. Weather restrictions for instrument approaches are as listed in paragraph 3.3.4
      of this instruction.
      3.13.1.9. If the aircrew is approaching the airfield on an IFR clearance and not intending
      to fly an instrument approach, weather conditions must permit a VFR descent from the
      appropriate IFR en route altitude.
      3.13.1.10. Aircrews will immediately notify the operations supervisor if any hazardous
      conditions exist at an NTA that would prevent normal operations.
   3.13.2. Each OG commander will approve and require a training program to prepare
   aircrews to operate in the NTA environment. As a minimum, the program will include a
   discussion of all applicable codes of federal regulations, advisory circulars, and AIM
   references on NTA operations. Training will emphasize standard civilian radio phraseology.
3.14. Functional Check Flights (FCF):
   3.14.1. Do not conduct an FCF with other type missions except FCF continuation training or
   FCF upgrade training flights. All FCF requirements will be accomplished by an FCF pilot or
   a pilot in training status with an FCF IP on board.
   3.14.2. The OG commander may waive a complete FCF and authorize an FCF to check only
   systems disturbed by maintenance, inspection, or modification.
   3.14.3. Maneuvers not in accordance with TO 1U-18(V)B-6CF-1, Functional Check Flight
   Procedures, will not be flown or practiced on FCF missions.
3.15. Mandatory Advisory Calls. Mandatory advisory calls while in IMC, or simulated IMC,
for the PNF are as follows: (Note: Minimum descent altitude (MDA) and decision height (DH)
are determined using the guidance in paragraph 3.3.4 of this instruction.)
   3.15.1. Nonprecision Approaches:
      3.15.1.1. “One hundred feet” above MDA.
      3.15.1.2. “Minimums” at MDA.
      3.15.1.3. “Continue” when the runway environment is in sight.
      3.15.1.4. “Go-around” at missed approach point if the runway environment is not in sight
      or the aircraft is not in a safe position to land.
   3.15.2. Precision Approaches:
      3.15.2.1. “One hundred feet” above DH.
      3.15.2.2. “Land” at DH if the runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a
      position for a safe landing.
      3.15.2.3. “Go-around” at DH if the runway environment is not in sight or if the aircraft is
      not in a position for a safe landing.
AFI11-2UV-18V3 3 JANUARY 2012                                                                        19


   3.15.3. Climb-Out or Descent:
       3.15.3.1. Transition altitude or transition level.
       3.15.3.2. One thousand feet above or below assigned altitude.
       3.15.3.3. One thousand feet above initial approach fix altitude or holding altitude.
       3.15.3.4. One hundred feet above procedure turn and final approach fix altitude.
3.16. Transfer of Aircraft Control. Both pilots must know at all times who has control of the
aircraft. In all cases, the pilot assuming control of the aircraft will state, “I have the aircraft” and
will shake the yoke. The pilot relinquishing control will state, “You have the aircraft.” Once
assuming control of the aircraft, maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above.
3.17. Post Flight. After flight, aircrews will:
   3.17.1. Complete AFTO Form 781 and notify maintenance of discrepancies.
   3.17.2. Ensure the wheel chocks, and if wind conditions warrant, control locks are installed
   before leaving aircraft.

                              PARACHUTING OPERATIONS

5.1. General. This chapter describes procedures for conducting parachute operations (wind drift
indicator [WDI] and personnel airdrops). Coordination between the PIC, the JM, and the drop
zone control officer (DZCO) is the key to successful parachuting operations.
5.2. Drop Zone (DZ) Requirements. Conduct all training jumps in DZs that are surveyed and
approved according to AFI 11-410.
5.3. Air Operable Cargo (Lexan) Door Procedures:
   5.3.1. The Lexan door will remain closed below 1,500 feet AGL.
   5.3.2. The pilot will authorize opening the Lexan door. The initial clearance to open the door
   is valid for all jump operations on that sortie, unless the PIC directs the JM to keep the door
   closed.
   5.3.3. Only a qualified JM or an additional aircrew member may open the door.
5.4. Wind Drift Indicator (WDI) Drop Procedures:
   5.4.1. The JM will determine the WDI drop altitude (normally 3,000 feet AGL; 2,000 feet
   AGL minimum).
   5.4.2. Pilots will fly WDI drop passes as coordinated with the JM (normally 80 to 85 KIAS
   with 10 degrees of flaps).
   5.4.3. The pilot will turn on the green jump clearance light prior to the WDI drop and the red
   jump clearance light immediately after the WDI drop.
   5.4.4. Units will publish procedures for monitoring the WDI during its descent.
   5.4.5. After the WDI drop, the JM will brief proposed jump runs to the pilot.
5.5. Personnel Airdrop Procedures:
   5.5.1. The JM will coordinate the airdrop airspeed with the pilot. The maximum airdrop
   airspeed is 140 KIAS.
   5.5.2. The JM will determine the airdrop altitude (paragraph 3.5.2). The maximum airdrop
   altitude is 17,500 feet MSL.
   5.5.3. The pilot will coordinate final jump run approval with the DZCO.
   5.5.4. The red jump clearance light will be red at all times until clearance is received from
   the DZCO. Once cleared for the drop, the pilots will turn on the green jump clearance light
   prior to the airdrop and the red jump clearance light immediately after the airdrop.
   5.5.5. The pilots will adjust the airdrop pattern to maintain adequate intervals between
   personnel airdrops. Units will determine the minimum intervals between each type of
   airdrop.
 24                                                         AFI11-2UV-18V3 3 JANUARY 2012


   5.5.6. On the jump run final, the pilots will make heading corrections as requested by the JM
   using the interphone or the directional command steering lights. Make heading corrections
   using rudder only.
   5.5.7. Static line personnel airdrops are not authorized.
5.6. Negative Drop Procedures:
   5.6.1. Turn on the red jump clearance light and terminate an airdrop any time:
       5.6.1.1. An unsafe condition develops.
       5.6.1.2. The JM directs a go-around. Notify the DZCO.
       5.6.1.3. The DZCO cancels the drop clearance. Notify the JM.
       5.6.1.4. Another aircraft becomes a conflict with the flight or the jumpers.
       5.6.1.5. The pilots or JM determine that jumpers will not land within the DZ.
   5.6.2. If the aircraft is on final for a jump run, the pilot will bank the aircraft to the right and
   call “negative drop” on the interphone.
5.7. Communications:
   5.7.1. The pilots will notify the appropriate ATC facility prior to conducting parachuting
   operations. Report the highest airdrop altitude.
   5.7.2. In-flight communications with a DZCO is required during all parachuting operations.
   A DZCO clearance is required before WDI or personnel airdrop.
