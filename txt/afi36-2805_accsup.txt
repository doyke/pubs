SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed: This revision expands
eligibility of those authorized to use appropriated funds for On-the-Spot Recognition and Appreciation
Awards programs to group and squadron commanders.
1.4.5. (Added) On-The-Spot Recognition and Appreciation Awards. It is important to recognize
military and civilian personnel who, by dedicated individual effort, facilitate successful accomplishment
of a particular program, function or mission. This type of program provides senior leadership with an
informal means to show special recognition of, and appreciation for, a job well done. Coins, trophies,
plaques, pens, emblems, certificates, or similar items are appropriate forms of recognition.
1.4.5.1. (Added) The following Air Combat Command (ACC) personnel are authorized to use
appropriated funds to purchase awards for their On-the-Spot Recognition and Appreciation Awards
Program.
1.4.5.1.1. (Added) ACC Commander
 2                                                               AFI36-2805_ACCSUP 23 JULY 2009


1.4.5.1.2. (Added) ACC Vice Commander
1.4.5.1.3. (Added) ACC Command Chief Master Sergeant
1.4.5.1.4. (Added) ACC headquarters directors
1.4.5.1.5. (Added) ACC center commanders
1.4.5.1.6. (Added) ACC numbered Air Force (NAF) commanders
1.4.5.1.7. (Added) ACC wing commanders (including expeditionary wing commanders)
1.4.5.1.8. (Added) ACC NAF and wing command chief master sergeants (including expeditionary wing
command chief master sergeants)
1.4.5.1.9. (Added) ACC group and squadron commanders (including expeditionary group and squadron
commanders)
1.4.5.1.10. (Added) No other individuals or positions are authorized to use appropriated funds to
supplement AFI 36-series awards regulations to create their own “On-the-Spot Recognition” and
“Appreciation Awards Program”. If other commanders or individuals desire to award coins, they must
do so at their own expense or by using self-generated funds (e.g., unit activity, morale, snack, etc.
funds).
1.4.5.2. (Added) Appropriated funds may be used to purchase coins, plaques, pens, or similar items if
they are used as a form of recognition as stated in paragraph 1.4.5 (Added). These items are only to be
used to recognize exceptional mission accomplishment if appropriated funds are used. They will not be
used as mementos or gifts (including going away gifts), nor should they be issued simply for being
assigned to an organization (refer to AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds, to use funds to
purchase mementos/gifts).
1.4.5.2.1. (Added) The award must be modest and not wasteful or extravagant if appropriated funds are
used to purchase “On-The-Spot Recognition” and “Appreciation Awards”.
1.4.5.2.2. (Added) When using appropriated funds, organizational coins will not be personalized by
stamping the presenter’s name on the coin or by adding them after the coin is cast. The coins are to be
presented as cast from the die without further embellishment (i.e. presenter’s name engraved). They are
organizational coins, not personalized mementos. Only use the organization and the position of the
presenter (e.g., 509th Bombardment Wing Commander, Whiteman AFB, Missouri). Personalized coins
create frozen stock (waste) when personnel change and require an additional expenditure to recast.
EXCEPTION: The Commander, Air Combat Command (COMACC) is authorized to personalize
coins IAW AFI 65-601 Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
1.4.5.3. (Added) Items purchased with appropriated funds will be clearly accounted for and stored
independent of office supplies. Authorized presenters are responsible for this recognition program and
must establish local accountable inventory procedures to document purchase, distribution, etc. Contact
supporting records managers as required for document retention and disposition.
1.4.6. (Added) Heart Link. The Heart Link Spouse Orientation Program is a COMACC directed
program, and the ACC Directorate of Manpower, Personnel and Services (HQ ACC/A1) is the ACC
office of primary responsibility. Installation commanders or their representatives will present this award
to spouses who completed the Heart Link Spouse Orientation Program. This award provides installation
leadership with an informal means to show special recognition of, and appreciation for, spouses’
dedication in support of the Air Force mission. The Heart Link Recognition and Appreciation Award
will be a coin.
