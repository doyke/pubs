This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 34-266, 24 Septem-
ber 2007, Air Force Fitness and Sports Programs. Air Force Reserve supplementary material is indicated
by (AFRC) in boldface type. It applies only to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) installations and
assigned units; and AFRC units collocated on active duty installations, National Guard installations, or
off-base facilities. This supplement describes Air Force Reserve procedures and guidance to be used in
conjunction with the basic instructions. This instruction provides direction and guidance to AFRC instal-
lations and units considering or currently operating a Unit Physical Training Facility (formerly Mini Fit-
ness Center) located at their unit work area and outside the scope and oversight of Services-operated
Fitness Center facilities. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publica-
tion are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://afrims.afm.af.mil/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
A new AFI 34-266 has been published. Paragraphs 1.2.2, 1.2.2.1, 1.2.2.2., and 1.2.2.2 have been renum-
bered to 1.3.3., 1.3.3.1. (Added), 1.3.3.2. (Added), and 1.3.3.3. (Added) to align with the basic instruc-
tion.
1.3.3. Unit Physical Training Facility (UPTF) (Note: UPTF supersedes the term mini fitness center).
The installation Commander authorizes UPTFs (unit owned, funded, and maintained fitness areas not
operated by the Services squadron/division) when he/she validates the installation’s fitness facilities can-
not meet the requesting unit’s requirements. The number of UPTFs should be kept to a minimum and
approved only when circumstances warrant their existence. Request for a UPTF are submitted by the Unit
Commander to the Installation Commander, after coordination with the Services Commander/Division
2                                                               AFI34-266_AFRCSUP 13 JUNE 2008


Chief of the installation. UPTFs must be equipped commensurate with Air Force fitness equipment
Golden Eagle Standards (GES). All equipment must be of commercial grade/quality. Units approved to
operate a UPTF will coordinate with the base Fitness Center Director to purchase equipment and mainte-
nance contracts using Allowance Standard 410, Allowance ID 410COOB, and in accordance with manu-
facturer’s recommendations.
1.3.3.1. (Added) Free weights, such as weight plates that are hand loaded onto weight bars, are not per-
mitted for use in UPTFs. When UPTFs are located within a hanger, maintenance area, or other unique
work environments, fitness equipment must be located on the ground floor of the facility. Fitness equip-
ment will not be located on balconies, mezzanines, catwalks, or other raised platforms.
1.3.3.2. (Added) Rules and restrictions governing use of the UPTF must be developed and posted in plain
view in the fitness area. Signage will include emergency phone numbers for medical assistance in the
event of an emergency. A member of the unit will be designated as the UPTF Safety Monitor to assure
equipment and area is maintained in a safe and usable condition. There must be at least three unit person-
nel trained (one per shift) in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), basic first-aid, and the use of auto-
matic external defibrillator (AED). A basic first-aid kit, AED, and phone will be located in the immediate
area of the UPTF.
1.3.3.3. (Added) An operating instruction (OI) will be developed by the unit operating a UPTF to outline
rules, requirements, and guidance associated with the operation, equipment, safety, and use of the fitness
equipment and area. The OI will be maintained in the immediate area of the UPTF.
