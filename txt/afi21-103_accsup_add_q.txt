            Addendum Q


This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting. It
applies to all E-9A ACC units. This addendum does not apply to Air National Guard or Air Force
Reserve Command units and members. Maintain records created as a result of prescribed processes in
accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and dispose of them IAW the AF
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims.
Contact supporting records managers as required. Send recommended changes or comments on AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to HQ ACC/A4YA-E4, 219 Dodd Blvd,

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This document added and
removed items from Table 1. The requirements for an airframe, propeller system, and power plant have
been removed, while additions include various communication and navigational devices. Notes
concerning each item have also been changed accordingly.
1.General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground work
for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential systems and subsystems
that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime, training, test or other
missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness Status of Resources and Training
Systems reporting only and denotes Mission Capable (MC) aircraft capable of being configured for a
contingency mission in accordance with COMACC Omnibus Plan.

1.1.Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex degraded mission
systems such as suspension equipment.
1.2.Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully Mission
Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A Not Mission
Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be configured and
generated to MRA status at an employment site.
1.3.All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major Command
(MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another MAJCOM
theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the unit's requirements and
resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
1.4.Reading the MESL. Due to the unique nature of the E-9, no -06 work unit code (WUC) manual was
created for this program; there are no WUCs within Table 1 to reference. This MESL instead is read by
comparing the systems listed in the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List
(BSLs) across the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines
applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft and therefore
it is important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the unit's
assigned aircraft.
