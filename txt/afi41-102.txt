                                    PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS).
     1.1.1. (MEPRS) is a cost management system that accumulates and reports expenses,
     manpower, and workload performed in DoD fixed military medical and dental treatment
     facilities. It is the basis for establishing a uniformed reporting methodology that provides
     consistent financial and operating performance data to support senior leaders who are
     responsible for allocating the programmatic resources used to sustain the health care delivery
     system. The MEPRS information assists in measuring productivity and management
     effectiveness, developing performance standards and process improvement initiatives to
     enhance business planning opportunities and resource allocation.
     1.1.2. Since the data derived from MEPRS may be incorporated into business planning
     analysis and used by the AFMS and DoD in making strategic programmatic decisions-- the
     data must be accurate, timely and reliable. Data integrity issues can affect the outcome of
     studies, analyses, and metrics; resulting in erroneous assumptions and leading to faulty
     decisions made concerning the efficiency and effectiveness of medical facilities and provider
     productivity.
     1.1.3. MEPRS identifies the cost of care provided in Medical Treatment Facilities by
     product line and beneficiary category. MEPRS connects the expenses incurred with the FTEs
     reported and workload generated in each MTF by Functional Cost Code (FCC); it will be
     used as a historical representation of the MTF for comparative analysis performed at higher
     Headquarters and DHA.

                                     DATA SUBMISSION

4.1. Data submission suspense. Each Air Force Fixed MTF is required to submit MEPRS data
monthly, 45 calendar days after the end of the data month. Medical facilities that are subordinate
to a reporting medical facility do not submit separate reports since their workload and expense
statistics are combined into the parent facility's report; however a child DMIS ID may be used
(when authorized) to further granulate data. This is Self-Inspection Checklist Item 18. (T-0)
   4.1.1. Each reporting facility forwards the monthly MEPRS files to the EASIVi Repository
   after validation; reconciliation and allocation have been completed, no later than 45 calendar
   days after the close of the reporting month. If later than 45 calendar days, annotate the
   reason for delinquency on the Data Quality Statement. This is Self-Inspection Checklist Item
   31. (T-0)
   4.1.2. Reports required for monthly backup. As a minimum, the following monthly
   reports must be saved electronically using the following naming conventions:
Note: Monthly Data should be saved and retained for five years. Ensure if corrections are made
the newly corrected, dated and signed files are saved.
       4.1.2.1. Expense Allocated FCC Summary – Exp Allocated MoYr_DMIS ID (Allocation
       Verification folder).

       subfolder).
   4.1.3. Refer to the current FY’s MEPRS Processing Timeline Matrix for specific completion
   timelines.
4.2. Limited Scope Medical Treatment Facilities (LSMTFs) or Acute Care Units (ACUs)
are not required to process MEPRS data. These facilities perform a predominately Family
Medicine mission to a generally AD Population and there is no need for further granulation of
these units data. There are also has several Aid Stations that are minimally staffed to perform
immediate medical care and are not considered for MEPRS reporting. ACUs are Line funded.
Any provider that spends time working in a MEPRS Reporting MTF should report time as
borrowed staff.

5.2. Work Center Definition. A work center is a discrete functional or organizational
subdivision within an MTF authorized to accumulate and measure expense, workload, manpower
utilization and performance.
   5.2.1. The following criteria listed below must be met before establishing a work center and
   assigning an FCC; it must:
       5.2.1.1. Have compatibility with the Unit Manning Document (UMD) or other allocated
       manpower (e.g. contractors).
       5.2.1.2. Have identifiable expenses (Supplies/Equipment/Contracts/Salaries).
       5.2.1.3. Have allocated physical space.
       5.2.1.4. Have valid production (count/code) as defined by DoD 6010.13-M or an AF
       special interest program (Attach 2).
       5.2.1.5. Have a uniqueness of service provided or expenses incurred when compared to
       other established work centers.
       5.2.1.6. Have Executive Leadership coordination.
Note: FCCs not listed on the AF Master ASD or Program Element Mapping (PEMAP) will not
be entered into CHCS/AHLTA or other systems without approval from AFMOA.
5.3. Establishing Functional Cost Codes (FCC) for a new work center shall be made in
coordination with basic coding guidance. FCCs and related data, as defined by the Account
Subset Definition (ASD) form the basis for cost allocation.
   5.3.1. First determine if the new work center meets the above requirements as stated in par
   5.2.
   5.3.2. MTF must receive approval from AFMOA/SGAR before new FCCs are implemented.
   This is Self-Inspection Checklist Item 3.
5.4. Account Subset Definition (ASD) identifies the FCCs used by an MTF, the activation
date, deactivation date, if applicable, and the Responsibility Center/Cost Center
(RC/CC). It specifies the Assignment Sequence Number (ASN), which is used in the
allocation/purification process. It also defines the Data Sets used in the allocation and
purification process (refer to Table 8.1. and 8.2. in this instruction for more information on Data
Set usage). AFMOA/SGAR will validate all facilities’ ASD annually.
   5.4.1. The ASNs are published on the Master MEPRS Table that is released annually from
   the Air Force MEPRS Program Manager.
   5.4.2. During budget preparation for the new Fiscal Year (FY), the MTF Budget Analyst
   (BA), Resource Advisors (RA) manpower manager, MPM, and logistics office must
   coordinate work center RC/CCs and FCCs or FACs. The addition or deletion of work centers
   or FCCs must be coordinated with each affected program to ensure proper allocation of data.
 16                                                                     AFI41-102 9 MAY 2014


   This will occur following the close out of the 3rd quarter. This is Self-Inspection Checklist
   Item 15. (T-0)
   5.4.3. Following in-house coordination, the MTF must submit the coordinated ASD to
   AFMOA/SGAR for review and approval. (T-0)
Note: Brief all changes during Data Quality, Executive Committee and Cost Center Manager
(CCM) meetings to ensure widest possible dissemination.
       5.4.3.1. Coordinate with systems administrators to ensure the accuracy of tables located
       in Composite Health Care System (CHCS), Armed Forces Health Longitudinal
       Technology Application (AHLTA) and Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support
       (DMLSS) or any other system(s) that interface with or provide data to EASIVi. This is
       Self-Inspection Checklist Items 18, 19, and 20. (T-0)
   5.4.4. DoD 6010.13-M is the master document used to ensure FCCs reflects the correct
   workload capture and expense assignment. RC/CC codes and Functional Account Codes
   (FACs) are matched to Functional Cost Codes (FCCs) as outlined in the PEMAP
   spreadsheet. All FCCs and RC/CCs used by the budget analyst, manpower manager,
   resource advisors, and logistics office should reflect the same information. The PEMAP is
   published annually by AFMSA/SGYR, validates appropriate MEPRS Code RC/CC Program
   Element Code (PEC) FAC usage; there may be multiple RC/CCs assigned to the same FCC,
   so that a more accurate tracking of financial information may be performed. (T-0)
Note: The PEMAP is frequently updated throughout the year so always ensure you are working
with the most current version. Refer to Knowledge Exchange - MEPRS Documents page for
most current version.
5.5. Cost Pool "X" Codes are used in situations where time and expenses are difficult to assign
directly and are used by more than one FCC because the work centers share physical space,
personnel, and/or supply items. Cost pools can be set up for any clinical function. Care should
be taken to ensure that all members of the cost pool benefit from all elements of the cost pool.
For example, establish a cost pool when multiple Family Health Clinic teams share
supplies/personnel and it is difficult to determine each clinic’s use. Identify cost pools with an
"X" in the third position of the FCC. Example - The code for Family Practice Teams B (BGAB)
and H (BGAH) cost pool would be "BGXA." Assign all shared personnel and expenses (i.e.
supply costs, square footage, linen, etc.) to the cost pool code. Those accumulated costs are then
distributed from the cost pool to the specialties within the cost pool based on workload for each
specialty during the purification process.
Note: Only shared administrative staff should report time to a cost pool; clinical support should
charge directly to the different teams as they are performing work in the specific clinical areas.

Note: Clinicians are never assigned to, or able to charge time against Cost Pool codes.
   5.5.1. Items purchased for a specific work center should be directly expensed to that work
   center. Any personnel salary, supply expense, contract cost or manning assist expense that
   can be readily identified to the pure code (example - BGAB or BGAH) should be reported to
   the specific work center. Cost pools can be used for any clinical area.

                                 TABLE MAINTENANCE

6.1. Tables used within the EASIVi system ensure personnel, financial and workload data
are properly identified and aligned for correct cost allocation. All EASIVi and associated
system tables will be reviewed and updated at least annually.
6.2. AFMSA/SGYR will review and update the master tables at least annually but also as
needed throughout the year.
6.3. MTFs will keep the tables in EASIVi updated to reflect current year activities. (T-0)
   6.3.1. Account Subset Definition (ASD) Table changes are made prior to each fiscal year
   following AFMOA/SGAR approval. This is Self-Inspection Checklist Item 3. (T-0)
   6.3.2. The MPM will approve all FCCs (with AFMOA/SGAR approval) in use at the MTF.
   (T-0)
   6.3.3. No MEPRS Codes will be used in CHCS/AHLTA or any other approved Military
   Health System (MHS) data system, without the AFMOA/SGAR approval. The CHCS
   Administrator, in coordination with the MPM, will ensure only approved MEPRS Codes are
   used in the CHCS Files/Tables. This is Self-Inspection Checklist Items 3, 5, 16, 18, 19, and
   20. (T-0)
   6.3.4. The DQ Assurance Team will provide oversight and ensure approved MEPRS Codes
   are being appropriately used in the CHCS File/Table structure. Non-approved MEPRS
   Codes will be identified and appropriate corrective action will be coordinated by the DQ
   Assurance Team.
   6.3.5. The EASIVi Account Subset Definition (ASD) Table will be reconciled with
   DMHRSi and the CHCS Site Definable MEPRS Table prior to the annual Fiscal Year
   update. This is Self-Inspection Checklist Items 4, 6 and 14. (T-0)
   6.3.6. The CHCS Administrator and MPM will complete an annual review of users who
   have access to add, edit or delete MEPRS Codes in CHCS. (T-0)
Note: The CHCS/AHLTA files are built for ease of use, not for acceptance into EASIVi. The
source system for correct FCCs is the EASIVi system. The same FCCs must be reflected in
CHCS/AHLTA as EASIVi. The CPT and DRG files must also be synchronized to avoid errors
when processing the Comprehensive Ambulatory Professional Encounter Record (CAPER) and
Standard Inpatient Data Record (SIDR). Ensure the same software versions are used.

                                            Chapter 7

              PERSONNEL UTILIZATION AND SALARY EXPENSE DATA

7.1. Time and Salary Reporting. Timely and accurate control of personnel data is essential for
the total success of MEPRS; personnel salary represents 60-75% of the total cost of care.
   7.1.1. Personnel data generally includes both salary and Full Time Equivalents (FTEs).
   MEPRS defines 168 hours as 1 (one) FTE. Please Refer to Para 2.11 for the responsibilities
   of the work center MEPRS POCs.
   7.1.2. There are a wide variety of helpful time reporting tools you can refer to for more
   detailed time reporting requirements, such as the MEPRS Quick Reference Time Matrix, and
   DoD 6010.13-M Appendix 3.
   7.1.3. All personnel working at the MTF during the timecard pay period will accurately
   report their hours in DMHRSi NLT COB the first duty day after timecard period ends
   (Monday). Actual hours should be reported, for work performed inside and outside the MTF
   in support of the mission. There is no hour reporting constraint (168 a month or 80 hours per
   pay period). The only exception would be Civil Service personnel refer to para 7.2.2. Refer
   to the DMHRSi EOM Processing Guidelines for more definitive instruction. (T-0)
7.2. All Personnel must submit their timecards NLT COB the first duty day after timecard
period ends (Monday). Timecard Approvers must approve or reject timecards NLT COB the
third duty day after timecard period ends (Wednesday). All rejected timecards must be corrected,
re-submitted and approved NLT COB the fifth duty day after the timecard period ends (Friday).
Upon rejection of a timecard, Timecard Approvers must immediately notify the individual that
their timecard was rejected along with the reason for the rejection. Actual Hours in support of the
mission should be reported in the appropriate Functional Cost Codes (FCCs), and should total to
at least the appropriate number of duty hours for that pay period. Hours are used to distribute
salary across the functional areas of the MTF, and are crucial in accurately reporting the cost of
services provided within the MTF. (T-0)
   7.2.1. United States active duty military personnel assigned and borrowed (e.g. manning
   assistance) to the facility. (T-0)
   7.2.2. Federal civilian employee assigned or borrowed to the facility. Hours reported by
   civil service personnel are reconciled with the Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS) pay file
   and will match time reported on their DCPS time card. (T-0)
Note: The one exception would be Providers under the Provider/Dental Pay Plan, only their
Non-Available time is reconciled, as they may have requirements to work more than the normal
80 hours per pay period.
   7.2.3. Foreign national employees (direct and indirect hire) paid from appropriated funds.
   (T-0)
Note: Indirect hires are foreign national personnel working within our facilities who are in-place
as a result of an agreement between the U.S. and a foreign government.
 20                                                                     AFI41-102 9 MAY 2014


   7.2.4. Military medical program students (e.g. phase II, interns, residents, etc.) working in or
   assigned to the facility to complete training requirements. (T-0)
   7.2.5. Contract personnel working in the facility. Contractors will submit only available
   hours (FTEs). Salary expenses (Financial Compensation) is reflected in the financial system.
   (T-0)
       7.2.5.1. If the contract doesn’t require personnel to report the number of work hours, the
       work center POC will refer to the Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) to determine the
       hours worked based on the statement of work and submit the available contract hours.
       7.2.5.2. Do not include day workers in the facility who are covered by a service contract
       (e.g. Copier Repair, or base CE personnel). These personnel are considered part of the
       services paid by the contract.
   7.2.6. Reserve, Air National Guard and Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA)
   personnel assigned to serve their tour at the facility. Personnel will report in accordance to
   current DMHRSi business rules. (T-0)
   7.2.7. Patient Squadron Personnel: Active duty members assigned to the patient squadron
   may help within the facility and their time is captured as borrowed personnel. Members of
   the Patient Squadron will use their appropriate Grade/Rank but will be assigned occupation
   codes that define the work that they are supporting. (T-0)
   7.2.8. Borrowed Personnel: Personnel borrowed from outside the facility (not on the MTF
   Unit Manning Document (UMD) will report their time and salary to the work centers they
   are supporting. An example of borrowed personnel would be the Squadron Medical Elements
   (SMEs) who are assigned to a flying squadron but provide services within the MTF. Track
   available time to the benefiting work centers for borrowed personnel, and report the
   remainder of their time to FCGC – Squadron Medical Element (SME) Non-MTF Activity,
   the total time they report should represent the total amount of time they worked during the
   reporting month. (T-0)
       7.2.8.1. Time for the entire pay period needs to be accounted for so that salary
       distribution to clinical services is accurate.
       7.2.8.2. Borrowed personnel will report time, until they are no longer performing
       recurring duties in the facility.
       7.2.8.3. If borrowed personnel (SMEs) are deployed from their unit, do not report any
       deployment time for them.
   7.2.9. Volunteers only report working hours as there is no salary compensation; included as
   volunteers are students utilized under an MOU with local colleges or facility programs such
   as Red Cross, Dental Assistant Program or pharmacy students. (T-0)
   7.2.10. All Non-DHP Employees working in Non-DHP programs such as, Family Advocacy
   (FASF) or Exceptional Family Member Program (FAZN), Domestic Abuse Victim Advocate
   (DAVA) (FASF) will report their time to the appropriate Code. (T-0)
7.3. Collect time until the member is no longer assigned (military and civilian), or working
(borrowed, contract and volunteers, etc. ) in the MTF.
AFI41-102 9 MAY 2014                                                                           21


Note: Report active duty departing personnel until their Report No Later than Date (RNLTD) or
day before they sign in at their next unit.
   7.3.1. For personnel, who are AWOL, continue to collect time for only the first 30 days. If
   the individual(s) are gone for longer than 30 days, depart them from the facility.
   7.3.2. When personnel process out for a PCS, retirement, or separation, report their time
   following their departure from the facility to the RNLT date, final duty day or separation date
   to FDGA – PCS/ETS Related Functions.
       7.3.2.1. The time they spend attending out-processing appointments will also be charged
       to FDGA – PCS/ETS Related Functions.
   7.3.3. Personnel attending school, report only the class time under FALA - Continuing
   Education (CE). Travel time will be charged to FDGA - PCS/ETS Related Functions.
   7.3.4. Personnel attending Professional Military Education (PME) will be captured in GBAA
   – Readiness Training. Travel time will be charged to FDGA - PCS/ETS Related Functions.
   7.3.5. When personnel are working outside of the MTF the entire month (deployed or TDY)
   or on leave it is not appropriate to report more than the total number of regularly scheduled
   duty hours in the reporting month. Keep in mind; we are trying to appropriately allocate the
   salary to the work produced.
   7.3.6. Time will not be captured or reported for civilian employees paid from non-
   appropriated funds or direct and indirect hire foreign national employees in an unpaid
   absence status time would not be captured for reporting.
   7.3.7. Civilians on leave without pay will report their time in DMHRSi under task code
   02.04. The timecard will reject in DMHRSi, during reconciliation, if hours are not input to
   match the civilian pay timecard.
7.4. The MPM will be responsible for importing the DMHRSi DoD EASIVi Create File
into EASIVi. Refer to the DMHRSi End of Month Manual (EOM) for step by step instructions.
(T-0)
7.5. The three types of FTE data are assigned, available, and non-available. DoD 6010.13-
M, Chapter 3, defines the use of available and non-available time. Refer to Appendix 3 for a list
of standard reporting scenarios.
   7.5.1. Available FTEs are based on hours worked. Available FTEs are calculated by
   dividing available hours in a given work center by 168 (1 FTE equals 168 hours). Actual
   hours should be reported to support all mission operations. Civilians are the only personnel
   category that has a capped hour requirement, the time reported on their civilian timecard.
       7.5.1.1. Military personnel report all hours spent in support of mission requirements,
       including work performed at home.           Civilian personnel will report approved
       overtime/compensatory time.
   7.5.2. Assigned FTEs are based on the actual number of days during each month an
   individual is assigned to the MTF. Assigned FTEs are not based on hours, but the percent of
   time actually assigned to a work center any given month.
 22                                                                   AFI41-102 9 MAY 2014


   7.5.3. Non-available FTEs include leave, sick (quarters/hospital admission/medical
   appointments), and military other (AD only).
   7.5.3.1. Leave is charged in accordance with normal duty hours (schedule). If personnel
   work a 12 hour schedule you would charge leave in 12 hour increments, but not charge leave
   on their normal off days.
7.6. Military salaries are standardized rates based on composites of all pay, allowances,
and entitlements updated annually (IAW AFI 65-503, U. S. Air Force Cost and Planning
Factors). Grade/Salary tables for Military will be provided to DMHRSi annually from the Air
Force MEPRS Program Manager as soon as they are available.
7.7. Civilian salaries are provided to DMHRSi by an interface with DCPS, local personnel
use the Automated Time Attendance and Production System (ATAAPS) to actually report
their payable work hours.
7.8. Available FTEs are applied against the Grade/Salary Table to calculate personnel
costs. Salary expense for non-available time is charged to the assigned work center.
7.9. The Grade/Salary Table reflects the monthly cost per FTE and is the maximum
amount that will be distributed. For example, if monthly salary is $2,500.00 and the hours
reported are 160 available and 32 non-available, then the total FTEs would be 1.14. The amount
distributed would still be $2,500.00.
7.10. Methods of Data Collection
   7.10.1. Defense Medical Human Resource System internet (DMHRSi) is the directed
   methodology of personnel time capture.
   7.10.2. The Military Health System (MHS), in fulfilling a Deputy Secretary of Defense
   mandate to simplify and centralize medical personnel asset visibility, has chosen DMHRSi, a
   Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) integrated Human Resource Management System.
   DMHRSi is intended to provide the MHS with an Automated Information System (AIS) that
   integrates HR data from multiple information sources and allows real-time access to essential
   manpower, HR, Labor Cost Assignment (LCA), Education and Training (E&T), and
   readiness information across the MHS.
   7.10.3. The Deputy Surgeon General (DSG) has mandated the use of the LCA, HR, and
   Manpower modules. The single most important factor for the Air Force is that DMHRSi will
   serve as a source system for manpower, human resources and readiness. The primary need
   for DMHRSi within the AFMS is to support functional processes for LCA, the critical labor
   source feed for the Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS), and the
   need for visibility of management data on all personnel working for the AFMS and
   subsequently the entire DoD.
   7.10.4. The HR asset for the MTFs consists of the following personnel types: active duty,
   guard, reserve, civilian or government service, contractor, local national and volunteer. HR
   assets can either be assigned to an MTF or borrowed from another military facility in order to
   fulfill specific functions within the MTF.
   7.10.5. Personnel data for active duty, guard, and reserve personnel is fed from the Military
   Personnel Data System (MILPDS) and data for government civilian service personnel is fed
   from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). Personnel data for contractors,
AFI41-102 9 MAY 2014                                                                        23


  local nationals and volunteers must be manually entered. HR personnel at each MTF will be
  responsible for the management of DMHRSi HR records for all person types throughout the
  employment life cycle, as outline in the DMHRSi Concept of Operations (CONOPS). A list
  of the HR roles and responsibilities are listed in DMHRSi CONOPS Usage Policies.
  7.10.6. The responsibility of HR personnel at each site is to effectively manage and update
  the DMHRSi HR records so that Senior Leadership has full visibility of all person-types
  working in a particular site and also visibility of all person-types enterprise wide. It is
  critical the site HR personnel perform record maintenance tasks and maintain the 18 essential
  data elements, as outlined in the DMHRSi CONOPS.
  7.10.7. The LCA, HR, and Manpower integrated management of DMHRSi is critical. Each
  MTF will form a Functional Integrated Working Group (FIWG) consisting of primary points
  of contact for each module to provide oversight to the DMHRSi processes, ensure it is used
  to its fullest potential, foster communication between functional areas, and recommend
  process changes to the MTF/CC.
 24                                                                  AFI41-102 9 MAY 2014


                                         Chapter 8

                               DATA SETS (WORKLOAD)

8.1. The Data Sets (Workload) section describes the workload data requirements of
MEPRS and includes an explanation of the applicability of existing Air Force data
collection procedures to the MEPRS data requirements.
8.2. Workload is captured in a data set that is used for allocation to quantify the amount of
work accomplished by a work center. DoD 6010.13-M defines specific allocation factors for
the various workload data. Air Force guidance and procedures will further define specific
workload reporting requirements. Workload is associated with both patient care and non-patient
care activities. Coordination with work center personnel, Data Quality Assurance Team, the
CHCS/AHLTA Data Base Administrator(s), and the MPM is crucial in establishing local
workload validation procedures. The Group Practice Manager must be an integral part of all
workload-capturing clinical processes. This is Self-Inspection Checklist Item 17.
   8.2.1. All workload factors will be covered in this document. Not all work centers
   documented on the master Accounts Subset Definition (ASD) File will be used by all
   facilities. The Unit Manpower Documents (UMD) will be the starting point to determine
   which codes should be reported in the system. For further guidance contact AFMOA/SGAR.
   8.2.2. Coordinate with appropriate work center personnel to determine the most efficient and
   effective means of acquiring the manually collected data. Implement additional procedures
   required by MEPRS reporting requirements as necessary. (T-0)
   8.2.3. If a work center closes, contact AFMOA/SGAR for appropriate actions.
8.3. Data Sets identify and collect different types of workload factors, expenses, FTEs,
weighted factors, and other information such as square footage, in a prescribed
format. Data Sets summarize workload data by FCC and show which work centers benefit from
a particular service.
   8.3.1. Table 8.1. is the automated and manually generated Data Set Standard Table and
   reflects how data is input into EASIVi. S indicates system-generated data and M indicates
   data that is manually tracked and input to EASIVi. For system-generated data, the Workload
   Assignment Module (WAM) must be used. Automated workload captured in CHCS will be
   transmitted via the WAM for use in the EASIVi System. The CHCS data is summarized for
   entry into EASIVi using generated reports in WAM, and must be validated prior to being
   transmitted to EASIVi.

8.4. Data Sets are used for:
   8.4.1. Allocation is defined as cost assignment of intermediate operating expense accounts
   (D -Ancillary & E - Support Accounts).
   8.4.2. Purification is defined as cost assignment of cost pool accounts.
   8.4.3. Refer to Table 8.2. Data Set Business Rules and other guidance supplied by
   AFMSA/SGYR to ensure accurate reporting. Coordinate with appropriate work center
   personnel to determine the most efficient and effective means of acquiring the manually
   collected data. Implement additional procedures required by MEPRS reporting requirements
   as necessary.
   8.4.4. Table 8.2. Represents all Data Sets used in EASIVi. It also identifies the workload
   factor indicator and the FCCs allowed/not allowed on the Data Sets and identify data
   elements that can be edited. Not all codes are used by all MTFs.

8.5. Workload accuracy and reconciliation: Workload accuracy and reconciliation is the
responsibility of the performing work center. The MPM in cooperation with appropriate MEPRS
work center POCs and work center managers will establish a process to conduct workload
validation, including assigning responsibility for validating data accuracy, data correction, and
accurate reporting. Significant workload inconsistencies will be corrected at the data source by
the work center and EASIVi will be updated accordingly. Consult AFMOA/SGAR for additional
guidance. This is Self-Inspection Checklist Items 7 and 22.
8.6. Work Center Specific Workload Validation: Workload reconciliation is a monthly
requirement to be performed by the MPM. To reconcile, compare the Monthly Statistical Report
(MSR) and the Workload Assignment Module (WAM) reports. EASIVi workload should be the
same as the data reflected in the WWR. Both data sets represent data as of the point in time
when the reports are generated and therefore may be different. Identified anomalies will be
reported to the Data Quality Manager and Group Practice Managers. (T-0)
Note: If End of Day Processing has not been accomplished, the End-of-Day Delinquency Report
will print instead of the Monthly Statistical Report. The Biometric Data Quality Assurance
Service (BDQAS) WWR suspense for inpatient facilities only is no later than the 5th duty day
after the month has ended, and WAM is usually generated later in the month.
   8.6.1. Inpatient Workload (A Accounts). Ensure proper FCCs are identified in CHCS
   Reports to identify the type of care the patient is receiving based on the specialty of the
   primary provider of care. Ensure inpatient ancillary requests contain the appropriate
AFI41-102 9 MAY 2014                                                                          29


   requesting inpatient FCC that is used during the inpatient stay while prescriptions issued at
   the time of discharge is properly assigned to the appropriate outpatient work center. Ensure
   workload has corresponding FTEs and expenses. (T-0)
Performance Factors: Admissions (ADM), Occupied Bed Days (OBD), Dispositions (Disp)
and Relative Weighted Products (RWPs)
   8.6.2. Outpatient Workload (B Accounts). Capture the workload where the care is provided
   (example: Provider assigned to Internal Medicine and sees a patient in Family Practice, the
   visit will fall under the Family Practice FCC). If the provider sees a patient in other than
   their normally assigned clinic, both workload (encounter), ancillary services (Lab, Rad,
   Pharmacy etc,) and time (DMHRSi) will be reported in the clinic where resources were
   consumed. Refer to the AFMS Workload Guidelines for specific workload reporting
   guidance. All workload must have corresponding FTEs and expenses. (T-0)
Performance Factors: Total Visits, Outpatient Visits and Relative Value Units (RVUs).
   8.6.3. Dental Workload (C Accounts). The MPM will receive the Monthly Dental Weighted
   Values (DWVs) and the Composite Time Values (CTVs) from the Base Dental Service
   Report (BDSR). The source data will be MEPRS DWV and MEPRS CTV Values for
   MEPRS Reporting. Ensure the workload has corresponding FTEs and expenses. (T-0)
Performance Factors: Dental Weighted Values (DWVs) and Composite Time Values (CTVs).
Note: Dental workload is provided to AFMOA/SGAR from the Command Dental Activity, and
should be the same data that is provided via the Base Dental Summary Report.
   8.6.4. Ancillary Services (D Accounts). Workload data reported within the Ancillary
   datasets will be used to allocate ancillary costs back to the requesting work centers. Use the
   MEPRS Group Report or other applicable ancillary report from CHCS or appropriate system
   to reconcile data reported in EASIVi ancillary datasets. (T-0)
       8.6.4.1. Pharmacy (DA). Ensure requesting work centers are accurately reported by
       reviewing workload products for invalid codes and coordinate with the CHCS Database
       Administrator to eliminate these codes in CHCS annually. Ensure the workload has
       corresponding FTEs and expenses. Use the PHR MEPRS Group Report to validate
       pharmacy workload reported. (T-0)
Performance Factors: Raw-Number of Scripts, Weighted-Weighted Value of Scripts.
Allocation methodology: Weighted Value of Scripts.

Note: Prescriptions provided to an Inpatient during discharge should be charged to the
Ambulatory MEPRS Code, not the Inpatient code (i.e and Internal Medicine patient (AAAA),
should have their prescriptions charged to BAA* not AAAA, based on the PCMH Team code of
the overseeing provider).
       8.6.4.2. Clinical Pathology (DBA), Cytogenetic Laboratory (DBD), and Molecular
       Genetics Laboratory (DBE). Ensure requesting work centers are accurately reported by
       reviewing workload products for invalid FCCs and coordinate with the CHCS Database
       Administrator to eliminate these codes in CHCS.          Ensure the workload has

       8.6.4.4. Special Procedure Services (DD) (i.e. electrocardiograms, pulmonary function
       tests, sleep studies, etc.). MTFs with a separately defined cardio or pulmonary function,
       or those which have work centers that conduct studies in one place on behalf of other
       clinics in the MTF or civilian network providers, will establish a non-count clinic with
       non-count appointment types in CHCS in the appropriate “D” FCC, to capture the
       workload and generate CAPER encounters for all workload done. The provider
       responsible for reading these tests will also capture their workload in a non-count clinic
       with non-count appointment type in the same “D” FCC, and will also generate CAPER
       records. The provider will capture their time spent reading these tests in the appropriate
       “D” FCC. All workload is manually entered into EASIVi. The recommendation is to
       generate as much of the data as possible through CHCS. CHCS data will be the source
       data system. Any remaining data not included in the CHCS generated data will be
       provided to the MPM within the prescribed timeframe. (T-0)

       expenses. (T-0)
Performance Factor: Raw-Cases, Weighted - Hours of Service.
Allocation methodology: Hours of Service.
   8.6.5. Support Services (E Accounts). Workload data reported within the support datasets
   will be used to allocate support costs back to the requesting work centers.
Note: Refer to Attachment 2 for Support Services FCCs using FTEs as an allocation
methodology.
       8.6.5.1. Third Party Collection Program (EBH). Ensure claims billed reflect the correct
       FCC for the specialty being billed. Also, ensure only appropriate FTEs are assigned to
       and reporting time to this work center. Personnel asking patients for other health
       insurance information in the clinics and ancillary services should not be reporting time in

       (EDI). These accounts support the infrastructure of the facility. Ensure the listed work
       centers have corresponding FTEs and expenses as appropriate. Only Plant Management
       would capture Time and FTEs, the remaining codes in this section would be for financial
       transactions only. (T-0)
Allocation methodology: Square Footage.
          8.6.5.2.1. Square Footage. All square footage of medical buildings must be reported
          by FCC at the start of each fiscal year and updated monthly as changes occur. Square
          footage and square footage cleaned is obtained from the Facility Management Officer
          using a report from Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS).
Note: Unused and facility common square footage would be reported against the plant
management FCC – EDAA/**5741 – Real Property Management.
       8.6.5.3. Transportation (EDG). The reporting of vehicle mileage is dependent on MTF-
       unique circumstances. Report all MTF vehicle mileage by FCC. When a work center
       has its own fuel card, the requirement for reporting mileage is unnecessary, as the cost is
       already being allocated against the using work center. If the fuel cards are shared or the
       MTF has GSA leased vehicles, then it is necessary to break out each user to make sure
       that expenses are allocated to the using work centers. Contact the Vehicle Control
       Officer/NCO for transportation issues.          Under other circumstances, refer to
       AFMOA/SGAR for clarification. Ensure EDG - Transportation has corresponding FTEs
       and expenses as appropriate.

       Medical Materiel is based on the Element of Expense Investment Codes (EEICs) used by
       the various work centers. A ratio of 6XXXX supplies used will be used to allocate the
       cost of Medical Logistics. This information is found in EASIVi under Standard Report
       section, Expense Accepted by RC/CC Report. Ensure EEA - Medical Logistics has
       corresponding FTEs and expenses as appropriate.       This is Self-Inspection Checklist
       Items 25 and 26. (T-0)

           8.6.5.5.1. Square Footage cleaned by FCC cannot exceed square footage by FCC, but
           will be most likely the same for clinical areas. For example, mechanical rooms are
           not cleaned under the housekeeping contract but are included in your square footage.
           Square footage cleaned is obtained from the Facility Management Officer using a
           report from Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS).
       8.6.5.6. Biomedical Equipment Repair (EG). Report Hours of Service by the requesting
       FCCs for Biomedical Equipment Repair Technician (BMET) repairs performed. Ensure
       the workload reported by FCC and RC/CC matches the current PEMAP. If this work
       center is a regional Medical Equipment Repair Center (MERC), ensure hours spent in
       support of outside activities are reported under the appropriate “FC” FCC. Ensure EGA -
       Biomedical Equipment Repair has corresponding FTEs and expenses as appropriate. The
       Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) MEPRS is the source document.
       (T-0)
Allocation methodology: Hours of service.
       8.6.5.7. Linen and Laundry (EH). Report clean, dry pounds of laundry issued to each
       requesting FCC. Beginning each fiscal year, validate the weight of each clean item on the
       master list by the Medical Materiel Flight. Ensure EHA - Linen/Laundry has
       corresponding FTEs and expenses as appropriate. Actual weight by work center can be
       used. (T-0)

                                     FINANCIAL DATA

9.1. Financial Data includes all expenses and obligations associated with operating the MTF
and meeting the organization’s mission.
9.2. Expense data is a combination of supply, equipment, contract, depreciation, additional
support and special program costs. These expenses make up the direct expenses for MEPRS
reporting. Expenses are collected monthly from Defense Financial Accounting System (DFAS)
or Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) using the Commander’s
Resources Integration System (CRIS) financial program as the source file for input into EASIVi.
Personnel expenses are generated from Defense Medical Human Resources System – internet
(DMHRS i)
   9.2.1. Financial Data reported in MEPRS are expenses-paid (AEP) and expenses-unpaid
   (AEU). Expenses will include all current months’ transactions that affect any current or prior
   year financial obligation. For information only, Total Obligations (AEP+AEU+UOO) is
   reported for only the current year.
   9.2.2. The MPM is responsible for calculating investment equipment depreciation at the
   beginning of each fiscal year. Only investment equipment currently in use at the MTF is
   depreciated. AFMOA/SGAR provides a Depreciation/Free Receipt Spreadsheet to assist in
   the determination of the monthly depreciation and free receipt calculations. This is Self-
   Inspection Checklist Item 29. The following procedures apply: (T-0)
       9.2.2.1. The depreciation expense will be charged to one or more of the following FCCs
       based on location of the investment equipment: Inpatient (EAAA), Outpatient (EABA),
       Dental (EACA), Special Program (EADA), or Medical Readiness (EAEA). (T-0)
       9.2.2.2. Request Medical Logistics provide a list of investment equipment currently in
       use from the Equipment Management Module of the Defense Medical Logistics Standard
       Support (DMLSS) system: Annual Capital Equipment Depreciation Report, and the
       DMLSS Active Historical Maintenance Report. These reports will provide necessary
       information (name, nomenclature, fiscal year in which received, purchase price, and cost
       center) to enter into the depreciation spreadsheet. (T-0)
       9.2.2.3. Do not depreciate equipment in the year of installation, start depreciating
       equipment the beginning of the next fiscal year. If equipment becomes no longer
       serviceable or is removed from the facility in the course of the year, make the appropriate
       updates to the depreciation spreadsheet. (T-0)
       9.2.2.4. Investment equipment purchases are identified and separately totaled by
       Inpatient, Outpatient, Dental, Special Programs, and Medical Readiness purchases. The
       investment equipment threshold is $100,000 unless changed by AF guidance. (T-0)
       9.2.2.5. Apply investment equipment purchases shared by inpatient and outpatient
       accounts using the applicable ratio in table 9.1. (T-0)

Note: If an MTF changes from inpatient to an outpatient facility, the depreciable equipment
must be moved in MEPRS to the current outpatient service using the equipment. Any inpatient
depreciable equipment transferred to another facility will be deleted from the listing.
       9.2.2.6. After the total dollar amount is established for inpatient and outpatient
       investment equipment purchases, enter it in the depreciation spreadsheet to yield the
       monthly depreciation expenses. (T-0)
Note: Dividing the total investment purchases by 60 months resulting in a five-year depreciation
cycle derives the monthly Depreciation Expense
9.3. Other Non-OBL Expenses are also calculated using the Depreciation/Free Receipt
Spreadsheet. Base support services, fire protection, and police protection expenses are assigned
in accordance with DoD 6010.13-M, Chapter 2, which designates assignment procedures
governing the work center account. These expenses are calculated monthly based on personnel
salaries and direct expenses from EASIVi using the Expense Accepted for Allocation Report.
More detailed instructions are provided in the Depreciation/Free Receipt Spreadsheet. This is
Self-Inspection Checklist Items 27, 28 and 29. The calculations are outlined below: (T-0)

       MPM. The Budget Analyst will coordinate with the MPM on all EASIVi financial
AFI41-102 9 MAY 2014                                                                          37


       adjustments. All errors, warnings and negative numbers for expenses and obligations will
       be researched, explained and documented by the Budget Analyst. If corrective actions
       cannot be determined locally, contact AFMOA/SGAR for further guidance. Corrections
       will be required in the month the error occurred and all subsequent months. Re-
       allocation and re-transmission of each month is required. Correction will be made in the
       source financial system as appropriate. (T-0)
       9.5.1.2. The MPM will work closely with the Budget Analyst to conduct the
       reconciliation. The BA will coordinate requirements with the Base Financial Services
       Office (BFSO), Defense Financial Accounting Service (DFAS), Civilian Personnel
       Office (CPO), or other critical base support agencies to ensure accurate data is received
       and minimal edits are required. The Budget Analyst and RMO Flight Commander will
       sign the finalized reconciliation documentation. This is Self-Inspection Checklist Items
       23 and 24. (T-0)
       9.5.1.3. Ensure financial data reported in EASIVi is the same as that reported through the
       financial management and DFAS systems. Source data received via the monthly
       financial file and must not be altered. (T-0)
       9.5.1.4. AFMOA/SGAR will provide oversight of financial reconciliation by conducting
       a quarterly comparison of EASIVi financial data to financial system reported data.
       Discrepancies will be communicated back to the MTF for explanation and/or correction,
       and to ensure the audit trail is complete.
       9.5.1.5. AFMSA/SGYR will conduct a financial reconciliation annually by comparing
       DFAS data to EASIVi. Again, any discrepancies will be communicated back to the MTF
       through AFMOA/SGAR for explanation and/or correction, and to ensure the audit trail is
       complete.
Note: Any changes to financial data, to include personnel salary, will necessitate updating the
monthly Depreciation/Free Receipt spreadsheet (personnel expense net or financial expense net).
Reallocate and retransmit as appropriate.

                                 MEPRS DATA QUALITY

10.1. The MEPRS Program Manager in conjunction with appropriate personnel will
ensure all systems’ files and tables are updated and synchronized as required. Data
reconciliation ensures program compliance and accuracy in collecting, coding, and reporting
workload, financial, and personnel data. (T-0)
10.2. The MPM will ensure initial and ongoing training of all personnel in the mechanics
of MEPRS data reporting. This is Self-Inspection Checklist Items 5 and 34. (T-0)
10.3. MTFs will use WAM for CHCS-generated workload data. Issues identified in WAM
or the workload migration process that drives update to data must be made in the source file of
CHCS by the responsible work center. After corrections, reinitialize WAM and resubmit file to
EASIVi. It would also be appropriate to regenerate and retransmit the WWR file during this
process if data affected impacted data reported in WWR, for inpatient facilities only. (T-0)
10.4. Changes to data in EASIVi can be made ONLY if correction in CHCS/AHLTA,
DMHRSi or the source financial system is not possible. Corrections made outside of the
source systems will be coordinated with the affected work center, the DQM, the GPM, the
Budget Advisor or Logistics as appropriate. (T-0)

A2.41. FEBB - Travel for Air Force Personnel/Non-Medical Attendants. This code acounts
for the costs of travel for active duty Air Force personnel and their non-medical attendants
assigned to locations without fixed MTF to obtain medical or dental care.
AFI41-102 9 MAY 2014                                                                           51


A2.42. FEBC - Travel for Family Members and Medical Attendants Overseas. This code
accounts for the costs of travel for the family members of active duty Air Force personnel and
attendants assigned to locations without fixed MTF, to obtain medical care when stationed
overseas.
A2.43. FEFA – Aero Medical Evacuation System. This code accounts for all the operating
expenses incurred by aero medical evacuation squadrons and detachments in support of the aero
medical evacuation system. Functions may include reception and processing of air evacuation
patients en-route to the MTF, as well as reception and processing of returning patients. This
work center is not a bedded activity and cannot be used where there is an operational ASF.
A2.44. BAKT – Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Clinic examines, diagnoses, and treats TBI
patients and provides a comprehensive plan of care for patients, including monitoring and
maintaining their state of health, counseling and guidance, health education, rehabilitation, and
prevention of disease. The Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Clinic is a distinct work center shall be
a subaccount that includes all expenses incurred in operating and maintaining the clinic, such as
expenses for personnel, supplies, travel, and any other expenses identified directly in support of
TBI activities.
A2.45. Patient Centered Medical Home Team Codes. Used to report labor hours, workload
and expenses for facilities using the PCMH Team concept to provide Internal Medicine (BAA*),
Primary Care (BGA*), Pediatrics (BDA*, BDB*) and Flight Medicine (BJA*). A complete list
is provided in attachment 4.
   A2.45.1. Ensure RC/CCs for these codes are mapped to the appropriate team, so that the
   expenses will be readily identifiable. Ensure that DMLSS also reflects the appropriate
   RC/CCs to issue supplies and equipment to the correct team.
   A2.45.2. Ensure the team codes are appropriately set up in DMHRSi with local
   organizations so the non-available time and expenses are charged to the correct team.
   A2.45.3. Using a cost pool to help account for shared space, supplies, expenses or personnel
   would be advisable.
       A2.45.3.1. Example – B Team: BGAB/540B – Patient Centered Medical Home Team
       B, shares a supply closet with BGAC/540C-Patient Centered Medical Home Team C,
       purchase those shared supplies in BGXA so that the cost of those supplies will be
       distributed to the teams based on the workload production of each of the teams.
A2.46. BAAR, BDAR, and BGAR – GME Resident Procedure Clinic. This code will be
used to report labor hours, workload and expenses for GME Procedure training, this code would
be affected by the GME Time splits of the Resident Training Program 50% of time to GME
Training (FAM*) and 50% of time to patient Care (B*AR).
A2.47. BAAZ, BDAZ, and BGAZ – Non-PCMH related functions. This code will be used to
report labor hours, workload and expenses for functions not appropriately captured under the
PCMH concept. These functions are, but are not limited to:
   A2.47.1. Clinical Pharmacy. Used to report labor hours, workload and expenses for
   facilities with a separately organized clinic providing Clinical Pharmacy Services. This will
   be a clinical function performed in an ambulatory clinic, not to be tracked as DA – Pharmacy
   workload.
 52                                                                    AFI41-102 9 MAY 2014


   A2.47.2. Primary Behavioral Healthcare Consultation Service. Behavioral Health
   Consultation Service (BHC Service) is a term used to describe any behavioral health service
   operating within a primary care clinic, using a consultative model of behavioral healthcare
   that is being delivered by a clinically trained Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC). In
   general, the goal of the BHC Service is to position the Behavioral Health Consultant on the
   healthcare team to augment and improve the delivery of overall healthcare, including
   behavioral healthcare. The BHC will not be used to provide comprehensive assessment or
   treatment of behavioral health conditions, as occurs in the specialty mental health clinic. The
   BHC may see the patient or perform limited interventions, but these activities are always
   designed to support the PCM’s impact on the patients’ health. On-going communication
   with the PCM regarding recommendations and the patient’s status is key to the BHC’s role.
   In contrast to specialty mental health settings, consultation by the BHC does not require a
   separate informed consent document since behavioral assessment and intervention are a part
   of the primary healthcare team’s service. Moreover, documentation is recorded only in the
   medical record rather than in a separate mental health chart. The PCM remains in charge of
   the patient’s care.
A2.48. BJAB – Personnel Reliability Program/Presidential Support Program
(PRP/PSP). Active PRP should be booked and seen under the BJAB MEPRS code. This code
is specific to PRP across the AFMS and will allow us to quantify the workload. AF/SG wants to
be able to quantify the PRP workload across the AFMS in order to build a business case to take
to AF/A10 requesting they fund the actual authorizations required to do PRP. It is in your best
interest to keep all PRP workload within the BJAB MEPRS code.
   A2.48.1. AF/SG directed that we rebuild PRP as a core competency within the AFMS. The
   only way we can do this is to group the PRP patients together so that they are seen by the
   same group of people. To this end, AF/SG directed that PRP would be managed and
   supervised by Flight Medicine across the AFMS.
   A2.48.2. The PRP Manpower Model and the new Flight Medicine Manpower Model are
   linked. As we looked at the PRP population at a base, if we rounded up to get a provider
   under the PRP model, then we would not round up in the Flight Medicine model to earn a
   flight surgeon. The intent being that these PRP patients with their earned staff (FAC 5320)
   would be embedded / combined with Flight Medicine. Additionally, the mix of PA's and
   physicians in the PRP Manpower Model was determined based on available flight surgeons
   as preceptors.
   A2.48.3. At bases that earn a stand-alone PRP clinic, the clinic (location and staff) should be
   integrated fully with the Flight Medicine Clinic under MEPRS code BJAB. Enroll all fly
   PRP patients to BJAA; workload coded as BJAB. Enroll all non-fly PRP patients to BJAB;
   workload coded as BJAB. The PRP-related administrative work, certifications,
   qualifications, etc., should be documented under MEPRS code FCGJ. The administrative
   work includes multi-disciplinary (Dental, Mental Health, Immunizations, Public Health, etc.)
   administrative evaluations.
   A2.48.4. At bases that have active PRP missions, but do not earn additional PRP staff, all
   PRP patients (both flyer and non-flyer) are to be seen within the Flight Medicine Clinic
   under MEPRS Code BJAA. Enroll all fly and non-fly PRP patients to BJAA; workload
   coded as BJAA. The PRP-related administrative work, certifications, qualifications, etc.,
AFI41-102 9 MAY 2014                                                                       53


   should be documented under MEPRS code FCGJ. The administrative work includes multi-
   disciplinary (Dental, Mental Health, Immunizations, Public Health, etc.) administrative
   evaluations.
A2.49. BJAC – Personnel Reliability Program/Presidential Support Program (PRP/PSP) –
Non-Flyers. This code would be used at locations where the Non-Flyer PRP/PSP personnel
would meet the requirement for a separately organized team.
A2.50. BJAT – Flight Medicine Trainee Clinic. This would be set up at MTFs where they
have a separately organized clinic to support Trainee Health, run by flight medicine. Refer to
above para A2.45.1 thru A2.45.3 for detailed info as to how to set this code up properly for
accurate reporting.
