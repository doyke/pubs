       2.3.2. Runway Visual Range (RVR) is measured by the FMQ-19. The equipment for
       Runway 04 is located north of the runway approximately 1,000 feet from the approach
       end. The equipment for Runway 22 is located north of the runway approximately 1,000
       feet from the approach end.
    2.4. Aircraft Arresting Systems.
       2.4.1. The BAK-12 (B) aircraft arresting systems stretch the width of the runway and are
       located as follows (see Attachment 2):
          2.4.1.1. Runway 04 (South BAK-12):
              2.4.1.1.1. 1,338 feet from approach end.
              2.4.1.1.2. 10,082 feet from departure end.
          2.4.1.2. Runway 22 (North BAK-12):
              2.4.1.2.1. 1,397 feet from approach end.
              2.4.1.2.2. 10,023 feet from departure end.
          2.4.1.3. (B) - DENOTES BI-DIRECTIONAL capability.
       2.4.2. The Fabric Braking System (MB-60) is a unidirectional arresting system found 35
       feet into the overruns of each runway. The cable is similar to that of the BAK-12 and is
       stretched 150 feet across the overruns (see Attachment 2).
       2.4.3. Arresting Systems and Procedures:
          2.4.3.1. Maintenance of arresting systems will be accomplished in accordance with
          AFI 32-1043, Managing, Operating, and Maintaining Aircraft Arresting Systems.
          2.4.3.2. Arresting System Configuration:
              2.4.3.2.1. Approach End: BAK-12 connected and in place across the runway,
              MB-60 (unidirectional) connected and in place across the under run.
              2.4.3.2.2. Departure End: BAK-12 connected and in place across the runway,
              MB-60 (unidirectional) connected and in place across the overrun.
          2.4.3.3. The control tower or Airfield Management must be notified prior to the
          approach in accordance with the Department of Defense (DoD) IFR supplement to
          ensure the cable is properly configured. Following any barrier engagement, Barrier
          Maintenance must recertify the arresting system before it can be put back in service.
          Recertification will take approximately 40 minutes for the BAK-12 and a minimum
          of 24 hours for the MB-60. However, response time for repositioning and
          recertification can lengthen this process depending on duty/on-call status of
          personnel.
          2.4.3.4. Power production will coordinate with Airfield Management Operations
          (AMOps) when planned maintenance will affect the operational status of the arresting
          systems. AMOps will then ensure proper authority has been granted to conduct the
          proposed maintenance. Only authorized power production personnel can take the
          barriers out of service.
MACDILLAFBI11-250 7 JULY 2010                                                                 5


         2.4.3.5. Power production will ensure AMOps is notified immediately when changes
         to the arresting system capabilities occur. AMOps will inform the control tower of all
         operational changes to arresting systems. AMOps will verify barrier status during the
         morning runway inspection and report status to the control tower along with airfield
         conditions.
         2.4.3.6. The arresting system at the northeast end of the field near the Dale Mabry
         Gate shall be referred to as "North BAK-12." The arresting system at the south end
         of the field near the water shall be referred to as "South BAK-12." The textile brake
         system barriers shall be referred to as ―North MB-60‖ and ―South MB-60‖.
     2.4.4. Emergency Actions:
         2.4.4.1. The pilots shall state their intent to make a barrier/cable engagement to the
         controlling agency as soon as possible.
         2.4.4.2. The control tower shall:
            2.4.4.2.1. Activate the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS).
            2.4.4.2.2. Immediately after the engagement, make the following transmissions
            on all ATC frequencies (275.8/118.575 and 294.7/123.7) and Guard frequencies
            (243.0/121.5):    "ATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT, MACDILL TOWER,
            MACDILL RUNWAY OPERATIONS ARE SUSPENDED DUE TO
            CABLE/BARRIER ENGAGEMENT, EXPECT A 30-40 MINUTE DELAY FOR
            LANDING." Make this transmission twice (updating the expected delay time).
            2.4.4.2.3. Release runway control to the on-scene commander once the
            emergency aircraft has come to a complete stop. Authorize runway access to
            responding emergency vehicles using the following transmission: "ALL
            EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLES ENTER THE RUNWAY AT THIS
            TIME."
            2.4.4.2.4. The control tower resumes control of the runway when notified by the
            Fire Department.
         2.4.4.3. Airfield Manager or designated representative will ensure BAK-12/MB-60 is
         properly configured and all foreign object debris and vehicles are off the runway prior
         to re-opening the runway.

            Airfield Management who will disseminate the approval to the Tower and base
            Weather.
            3.1.2.3. All transient aircraft requesting to arrive and/or depart during closure periods
            require 6 AMW/CC approval. The 6 AMW/CP will coordinate 6 AMW/CC approval
            for all transient after hours requests. Once AMW/CC approval is obtained, the
            information will be passed to Airfield Management who will disseminate the
            approval to the Tower and base Weather.
MACDILLAFBI11-250 7 JULY 2010                                                                   9


     3.1.3. With prior Airfield Management coordination, vehicles requesting access to the
     Controlled Movement Area (CMA)/Runway after hours will attempt to contact the
     Control Tower twice via the ramp net. If no response is received, vehicles are approved
     to enter the runway.
     3.1.4. MacDill AFB shall not operate as an uncontrolled airfield. Takeoffs and landings
     (except for emergencies) are not authorized during airfield closures.
     3.1.5. Transient Alert hours are 0600L-2200L as listed in the IFR Supplement. For
     tactical aircraft, limited transient parking is available; expect service delay(s). Unable to
     service aircraft with ordnance. Transient alert is contract maintenance; all transient
     fighter/trainer aircraft must land by 2100L, and all others must land by 2130L. Transient
     alert must get 6th Maintenance Group (6 MXG) approval for overtime for any aircraft
     arrivals/departures past 2200L.
  3.2. Runway in Use.
     3.2.1. The active runway shall be determined by the tower watch supervisor/senior
     controller only.
     3.2.2. Runway 04 is designated the primary instrument, calm wind, and alert force
     runway. This is to comply with stringent noise abatement procedures and aircraft flow
     requirements in the Tampa area.
     3.2.3. Runway 04 will normally be used for all flying operations at MacDill AFB when
     the tailwind component is 4 knots or less. Note: Before switching to Runway 22,
     MacDill Tower watch supervisor shall coordinate with Tampa TRACON supervisor to
     determine their runway in use and any anticipated runway changes. When the MacDill
     Runway 22 and Tampa Runway 36 are in use, all aircraft operations may experience
     delays. This configuration is complex and severely limits air traffic operations at both
     airports. Safety, however, will not be compromised. If severe weather, thunderstorms,
     high winds, etc., warrant Runway 22 operations, this configuration will be utilized.
     3.2.4. Tower will notify FAA Tampa Approach, AMOps, Combat Weather Team, and
     Fire Department of any change to the runway in use.
     3.2.5. Runway Surface Condition (RSC) checks will be accomplished and reported in
     accordance with AFI 13-213, Airfield Management, paragraph 5.4. MacDill AFB will
     report RSC as either wet or dry.
  3.3. Aircraft Taxiing.
     3.3.1. Transient Alert Procedures. When the Transient Alert dispatcher is notified by
     AMOps that a transient aircraft has landed, he/she will dispatch a "follow-me" vehicle to
     assist the aircraft. Transient aircraft not familiar with routes will be provided progressive
     taxi instructions and/or "follow-me" assistance.
     3.3.2. Taxiing with Live Ordnance. All aircraft loaded with armed forward firing
     ordnance will advise MacDill tower prior to taxiing and will taxi so as to avoid pointing
     their ordnance at any passenger-carrying aircraft.
     3.3.3. Space Shuttle and Space Shuttle Carrier landing and ground taxi procedures will
     be provided in accordance with the 6 AMW Space Shuttle Orbiter Vehicle (SCA/OV)
10                                                       MACDILLAFBI11-250 7 JULY 2010


     Contingency Support Plan. SCA/OV aircraft parking spots are located/painted on
     Taxiway Kilo and the South Ramp (Cal Docks).
     3.3.4. Aircraft towing will be accomplished in accordance with 6/927th Maintenance
     Group (927 MXG) OI 21-101.
     3.3.5. All helicopters will taxi to Taxiways Lima and Echo intersection per ATC
     instructions. Transient Alert will lead helicopter to parking at 52 Row, Spot C.
     Helicopters will not hover-taxi over any personnel, equipment, or aircraft on the ground.
  3.4. Aircraft Security/Stop Alert Procedures. Stop Alert procedures are designed to
  prevent and stop unauthorized engine start, taxi, takeoff, and landing at MacDill AFB. The
  control tower will maintain surveillance of all taxiing aircraft and aircraft tows. Tower will
  attempt to establish radio/light gun contact with any suspect aircraft and issue appropriate
  instructions. If unable to contact the aircraft or the instructions are ignored, the tower will
  immediately declare a ―Stop Alert‖ using the following procedures: Note: Not all ramp
  areas are visible from the tower. (See Attachment 2)
     3.4.1. MacDill Tower shall:
         3.4.1.1. Immediately activate the primary crash alarm system (PCAS) indicating the
         words ―Stop Alert,‖ the aircraft type, position, direction of movement, and any other
         pertinent information.
         3.4.1.2. Direct all taxiing aircraft to hold their present position until the stop alert is
         terminated or they are otherwise directed.
     3.4.2. Base Defense Operations Center shall:
         3.4.2.1. Dispatch a patrol to meet transient alert and the aircraft at the designated
         location.
         3.4.2.2. Notify Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) of the
         unauthorized aircraft movement/landing.
         3.4.2.3. Direct appropriate security forces to position themselves between the aircraft
         and priority resources on the airfield.
         3.4.2.4. Request the fire department respond to the designated location.
         3.4.2.5. Up-channel HELPING HAND/COVERED WAGON reports as necessary.
         3.4.2.6. Detain the pilot and take custody of the aircraft.
         3.4.2.7. Maintain control of the pilot and aircraft until it has been determined they do
         not pose a threat to priority resources and are no longer required as part of the
         investigation. Note: Should the situation require debarkation of crew and
         passengers, security forces will maintain surveillance and positive control at all times.
         Only the minimum force necessary will be used to ensure security while
         simultaneously rendering appropriate services to expedite resolution of the situation.
MACDILLAFBI11-250 7 JULY 2010                                                              11


     3.4.3. 6 CES/CL will:
        3.4.3.1. Ensure the Fire Department responds with a fire truck capable of causing the
        engine(s) of the aircraft to either flame out or shut down and block taxiways as
        required.
        3.4.3.2. Provide additional support as required.
     3.4.4. Airfield Management will:

  3.5. Control of Aircraft and Ground Vehicular Traffic.
     3.5.1. At MacDill AFB, the uncontrolled movement area shall be defined as the North
     Ramp, South Ramp, Deployed Unit Complex (DUC) Ramp, and taxiways. However,
     while on taxiways, all personnel, vehicles, and aircraft shall to the maximum extent
     possible, possess two-way radio capability on a channel/frequency allowing contact with
     the tower. Permission to enter these areas need not be gained from the tower. The sole
     purpose of the radio is to facilitate the taxi/ground movement of aircraft and aircraft
     related vehicles. While operating on the uncontrolled movement area, personnel shall be
     continually aware of their surroundings and periodically observe the tower for light gun
     signals.
     3.5.2. The controlled movement area (CMA) is defined as Runway 04/22, overruns,
     Taxiways Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, and Echo from the runway to the Visual Flight
     Rules (VFR) hold lines, and infield areas out to 175’ east and west of the painted runway
     edge.
        3.5.2.1. Radio contact with the tower and permission to enter are mandatory prior to
        crossing any boundary of the controlled movement area.
        3.5.2.2. Personnel shall use the FM (LMR) Ramp/Tower Net as the primary method
        to contact the tower. Cellular telephones are not an appropriate means of
        communication with air traffic control while operating in the CMA. Personnel
        operating in this environment shall avoid the use of air traffic control UHF/VHF
        frequencies.
        3.5.2.3. Vehicles operating in the CMA shall be two-way radio equipped or under the
        direct supervision of a two-way radio equipped vehicle. The radio-equipped vehicle
        shall establish and maintain two-way radio communications with the control tower
        while in the CMA. All vehicles shall exit the CMA immediately if two-way radio
        communication with the control tower is lost.
12                                                    MACDILLAFBI11-250 7 JULY 2010


        3.5.2.4. When Tower personnel wish to direct a vehicle off the runway and cannot
        establish radio contact, flashing the runway edge lights several times will constitute a
        runway exit command. Vehicle operators on the runway observing the flashing
        runway lights will immediately depart the runway. When recalled from the runway,
        vehicle operators will exit the runway at the nearest taxiway and position themselves
        behind the runway hold lines or at least 175 feet from the runway edge. Vehicle
        operators will continuously watch the tower for light gun signals.
        3.5.2.5. MacDill Tower is authorized to approve altitude restricted low approaches
        over vehicles, equipment, or personnel operating on the runway. A restriction of not
        less than 500 feet AGL (1,000 feet AGL for heavy jet aircraft) may be authorized.
        3.5.2.6. During evacuation of the control tower, vehicles on the runway will be
        instructed to exit the runway. Vehicle operations on the CMAs will be limited to
        emergency response operations only.
        3.5.2.7. Airfield Management is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the
        Flight Line Driving Program. All personnel driving on the flight line must be
        qualified in accordance with Chapter 25 of AFMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled
        Vehicle Operator, AFI 13-213, and MACDILLAFBI 13-200, Vehicle Operations on
        the Airfield, and possess a valid AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency. All
        contractors must receive an airfield briefing from AMOps before operating on the
        flight line. (If a user’s AF Form 483 is lost or misplaced beyond one year from the
        original pass date, the individual will be re-tested. Within one year, the individual
        will produce his or her documentation of training and certification form to justify the
        issuance of a new AF Form 483.)
            3.5.2.7.1. Vehicle traffic procedures are detailed in MACDILLAFBI 13-200.
            3.5.2.7.2. Agencies authorized privately owned vehicle (POV) passes are listed in
            MACDILLAFBI 13-200.

            MACDILLAFBI 13-200.
     3.5.3. All vehicles are restricted from operating within the lateral boundaries of any
     active drop zone (see Attachment 10) after the ―Jumpers 2 minutes out‖ call is made by
     the tower. Vehicles may resume operations when authorized by an ―All jumpers on the
     ground‖ call made by the tower or drop zone liaison. Drop Zone activities are published
     daily in the NOTAMs/Advisory Sheet.
  3.6. Runway Incursions.
     3.6.1. When an unauthorized vehicle enters the CMA (as defined in paragraph 3.5.2.),
     tower shall attempt to make contact with the vehicle and notify AMOps to investigate.
     Security Forces assistance will be directly requested as needed.
     3.6.2. The incursion may be elevated to a ―HELPING HAND‖ situation by the
     investigating agency if the runway incursion affects a protection level resource.
MACDILLAFBI11-250 7 JULY 2010                                                                 13


     3.6.3. Information identifying the vehicle, its operator, and duty section/employer will be
     obtained for inclusion into a USAF Hazard Report (AF Form 457) or Hazardous Air
     Traffic Report (HATR) (AF Form 651).
     3.6.4. Procedures for disposition of personnel involved in a runway incursion are defined
     in MACDILLAFBI 13-200.
  3.7. Precision Approach Critical Areas (see Attachment 4).
     3.7.1. Airfield Operations is responsible for the protection of the ILS critical areas.
     These areas are defined as follows:
        3.7.1.1. Localizer – A rectangular area parallel and perpendicular to the antenna
        array (including the 3° offset) extending from the antenna array 2,000 feet towards
        the approach end of the runway and 150 feet on each side of the centerline of the
        approach course. It includes a 50-foot extension behind the antenna array.
        3.7.1.2. Glide Slope – A fan-shaped area that extends from the glide slope antenna
        1,300 feet toward the approach end of the runway (or to the end of the runway,
        whichever is greater.) It covers an area 30 degrees each side of a line drawn through
        the glide slope antenna and parallel to the runway centerline.
     3.7.2. ILS Critical Areas are protected by means of establishing a controlled area or
     physically separating the critical areas from vehicular travel routes in order to prevent
     vehicles of all types from interfering with the radiation pattern emitted by the antenna
     array. Even the smallest interference can cause a significant deviation in the radiation
     pattern and affect the course of flight for landing aircraft.
     3.7.3. When an ILS approach to Runway 04 is in progress and the ceiling is below 800
     feet and/or visibility is less than 2 miles, tower will activate the North Boundary Road
     restriction lights on the tower lighting panel and have AMOps ensure lights and buzzers
     are functioning properly prior to the aircraft reaching 3 mile final. If lights are found to
     be inoperative, AMOps will request the 6 SFS to dispatch a patrol to restrict vehicle
     operations on the North Boundary Road (and South Boundary Road as needed)
     (Attachment 4).
  3.8. MacDill AFB Hangar 3/Ramp Quiet Hours.
     3.8.1. All requests for quiet hours will be forwarded to Airfield Operations (6 OSS/OSA)
     not later than two weeks prior to the event. Once approved by the 6 OG/CC, the Airfield
     Operations Flight Commander (6 OSS/OSA) will notify AMOps, maintenance operations
     plans and scheduling, command post, current operations, and tower of the date and times.
     AMOps will prepare and disseminate NOTAMs as appropriate.
     3.8.2. AMOps will pass quiet hour times to Command Post and Tower, who will post
     them on their operations boards. When required, the schedule will reflect a 15-minute
     "pad" for planned takeoffs and landings before and after the quiet period in order to
     accommodate unavoidable delays. However, ground operations may continue until 2
     minutes prior to the actual quiet period. The tower will make two blanket broadcasts on
     tower and ground control frequencies at least 10 minutes prior to and at the beginning of
     quiet hours using the following phraseology: "(Ramp) Quiet hours commence in XX
     minutes/are in effect at this time."
14                                                     MACDILLAFBI11-250 7 JULY 2010


        3.8.2.1. The term ―quiet hours‖ indicates that no operations are permitted on the
        airfield to include engine starts, engine runs, or taxiing aircraft. Any deviations must
        be requested and approved in advance through the Airfield Operations Flight.
        3.8.2.2. The term ―ramp quiet hours‖ applies for ceremonies in Hangar 3 and
        indicates that no engine starts, engine runs, taxiing aircraft, or vehicle operations will
        be permitted in the vicinity of Hangar 3. The affected area encompasses the transient
        spots 16- 20, DV spots 1-4, north ramp A1-A2, transient parking rows 52, 50, and 48,
        and any taxiing aircraft from the North Ramp to Taxiways Echo or Lima. All aircraft
        requesting pattern work should be advised of the quiet hours and proceed on an
        extended upwind to avoid overflight of the area. Any deviations must be requested
        and approved in advance through Airfield Operations Flight. Note: Aircraft can
        land/take-off from Runway 04/22, but must plan ahead to utilize the south ramp (Cal
        Docks area) and Taxiway Kilo in order to avoid the areas noted above during the
        ramp quiet hours.         Helicopter operations can utilize the alternate DUC
        arrival/departure location, but in all cases must avoid the noted areas.
     3.8.3. Time period and restrictions may vary depending on the type and location of the
     event requiring quiet hours. Most Change of Command ceremonies last one hour. Units
     should check the NOTAMs for quiet hour times.
  3.9. Weather Information/Severe Weather Procedures.
     3.9.1. Weather observations shall be transmitted via the New-Tactical Forecast System
     (N-TFS) to the 6 AMW Command Post, control tower, and Tampa TRACON at least
     hourly.
     3.9.2. Pilot Weather Reports (PIREP). MacDill Air Traffic Control personnel will relay
     to the Base Weather observer all PIREPs received from aircrew. Pilots may report
     PIREPs directly to METRO/PMSV (344.6 MHz). Base Weather shall ensure tower is
     informed of PIREPs transmitted via METRO/PMSV.
     3.9.3. Lightning Warnings. When the MacDill weather station broadcasts a lightning
     warning for lightning within five (5) nautical miles of the airfield, the following
     procedures apply:
        3.9.3.1. All personnel, including civilians, contractors, and transient/deployed
        personnel, must seek shelter in a vehicle, aircraft, or structure immediately after
        notification until the lightning warning has expired. The aircraft commander of an
        aircraft armed/loaded with hot/hazardous cargo may elect to disembark the
        crew/passengers if remaining on the aircraft creates a greater danger to personnel.
        Ground support will respond to transport the crew/passengers to shelter. Ground
        support will not vacate the transportation vehicle and no other ground/maintenance
        support will be provided.
        3.9.3.2. MacDill ATC (Local Control) will inform all inbound aircraft, ―A Lightning
        Warning is in effect, expect taxi and service delays.‖ MacDill ATC (Ground Control)
        will inform transient aircraft when on the ground that, "The airfield is in a Lightning
        Warning for lightning within 5 miles.            PARKING RAMP CLOSED FOR
        SERVICES. All aircraft will be held short of the parking ramp. Personnel will

  5.6. Alert Notification.
     5.6.1. The 6 AMW Command Post is responsible for the following:
         5.6.1.1. Notifying airfield management and control tower of daily alert call sign.
         5.6.1.2. Notifying the control tower of all alerts as soon as possible via the direct hot
         line.
         5.6.1.3. Terminating all alerts.
     5.6.2. Upon alert notification, the control tower will suspend runway operations except
     for aircraft within 1 mile of landing (full stop), aircraft past the hold line for departure, or
     aircraft blocking the path to the runway being used by the alert force. All other aircraft
     will remain outside of the arrival/departure corridor.
  5.7. Emergency Bailout/Jettison Procedures.
     5.7.1. If emergency bailout/stores jettison is required, aircrew should ensure stores
     and/or aircraft impact in the water or in an uninhabited area.
     5.7.2. When stores are jettisoned, the pilot will report the location of the stores to the 6
     AMW Command Post. Command Post will pass this information to the US Coast Guard
     as a possible hazard to surface vessels.
  5.8. Controlled Bailout Procedures.
     5.8.1. Aircrew planning a controlled bailout shall contact the 6 AMW Command Post
     and request coordination to enter the egress area. The primary egress area is the Avon
     Park Range. If weather or distance does not allow use of the Avon Park area, the area
     immediately southwest of Egmont Key, in the Gulf of Mexico, may be used as a
     secondary bailout area.
     5.8.2. Primary Controlled Bailout (Avon Park Range - VFR Conditions Only) (see
     Attachment 8).
         5.8.2.1. Contact Avon Operations on Guard (243.0 MHz) to confirm the area is clear
         prior to entering.
34                                                       MACDILLAFBI11-250 7 JULY 2010


         5.8.2.2. Position the aircraft south of the runway complex (approximately 2 NM),
         heading 050°, while maintaining safe airspeed and above 2,000 feet MSL. Bailout
         will be initiated as the aircraft passes abeam the center of the MacDill AUX 1 airfield
         runway. Prior to ejection, the pilot should take the necessary action to ensure the
         aircraft impacts within the confines of the Avon Park Reservation (nose down trim
         and idle power).
     5.8.3. Secondary Controlled Bailout (Gulf of Mexico) (see Attachment 9).
         5.8.3.1. Visually clear impact area to ensure it is free of surface vessels.
         5.8.3.2. The aircraft will be flown over Egmont Key, MCF 220°/21, heading 220°, at
         a safe airspeed and above 2,000 feet MSL. Bailout as the aircraft passes over the land
         mass at Egmont Key.
         5.8.3.3. If visual contact with Egmont Key is not possible, request Tampa Departure
         (119.65/353.575 MHz) give radar vectors to Egmont Key.
  5.9. Controlled Jettison Procedures. There are three controlled stores jettison areas for
  MacDill AFB Operations. Circumstances will determine which area is to be used.
     5.9.1. Tampa Bay. An area of water approximately 2,000 feet wide by 5,000 feet long
     adjacent to and west of the Runway 04 approach lights. Pilots will contact the 6 AMW
     Command Post stating reason for jettison and estimated time of arrival (ETA) in the
     pattern. Tower clearance is required. Obtain clearance to enter traffic for Runway 22.
     Enter at a point 2-3 miles from the approach end of Runway 22 at 1,600 feet MSL. Fly
     parallel to and to the right (north) of Runway 22 at 1,600 feet MSL. Security Forces,
     airfield management, and control tower personnel will assist pilots in ensuring that
     jettison area is clear of surface vessels. Stores will be released after passing the south
     boundary fence. Care should be taken to avoid dropping stores on approach lights or
     installations (see Attachment 9).
     5.9.2. Avon Park Jettison. Aircrew will contact 6 AMW Command Post for a phone
     patch into Avon Park for procedures and coordination (see Attachment 8).
     5.9.3. IFR Jettison. If weather precludes jettison of external stores in visual conditions,
     pilots will proceed to the secondary controlled bailout area (Egmont Key). Altitude
     should be 1,600 feet MSL. The area should be confirmed free of surface vessels using
     airborne/ground radar assistance. Heading will be 220° or as necessary to avoid surface
     vessels (see Attachment 9).
  5.10. Fuel Dump Procedures. 6 AMW aircrew will use the phrase ―adjusting gross
  weight‖ to indicate the need for fuel dumping after obtaining 6 OG/CC permission.
     5.10.1. After obtaining permission, the aircraft will proceed to MCF 212°/26 and
     establish themselves in a holding pattern. Fuel should be jettisoned above FL200 and the
     crew will record time, position, winds, and outside air temperature at the time of jettison.
     5.10.2. Should an emergency preclude the use of the above procedure, aircrews must use
     good judgment and record the time, position, and amount of fuel jettisoned and report the
     information to the wing safety office after landing.
MACDILLAFBI11-250 7 JULY 2010                                                                  35


  5.11. Hot Brake Procedures. A hot brake condition is a suspected, potential, or actual
  hazardous situation, attributed to overheating of the wheel brake systems.
     5.11.1. A hot brake condition will be treated as an aircraft ground emergency and the
     PCAS will be activated.
     5.11.2. Aircrew or ground personnel will immediately notify tower/ground control of a
     hot brake condition providing call sign, location, and aircraft tail number. The aircrew
     will taxi the aircraft as instructed to the designated taxiway areas completely off the
     active runway (see Attachment 2). Engines will not be shut down until fire-fighting
     equipment is in place.
     5.11.3. When a hot brake condition is verified, all nonessential personnel will evacuate
     the area within 300 feet of the aircraft.
  5.12. F-16 Emergency Power Unit (EPU)/Hydrazine Procedures. The F-16 EPU uses a
  highly toxic fuel called hydrazine (H-70). If the EPU is operated, a check must be made to
  ensure there is no hydrazine leak.
     5.12.1. When the EPU is used or a hydrazine leak is suspected, the aircraft must be
     isolated until a safety check can be made to determine if there has been an actual leak.
     5.12.2. The primary designated hydrazine inspection area is Taxiway A or E at either end
     of the runway (see Attachment 2). If it is not feasible to taxi the aircraft to the hydrazine
     inspection area, the aircrew will attempt to clear the runway and main taxi routes.
     5.12.3. The aircrew or ground personnel will immediately notify the control
     tower/ground control of an EPU activation and/or a hydrazine leak. The tower will
     activate the PCAS.
  5.13. Emergency Landing of Civil Aircraft at MacDill AFB. Civil aircraft making an
  emergency landing at MacDill AFB will be processed in accordance with AFI 10-1001 and 6
  AMW OPLAN 60-14. The aircraft will be handled as a stop alert.
  5.14. Dangerous Cargo. AMOps and Transient Alert are responsible for initiating actions
  required by the following:
     5.14.1. Aircraft will be parked, loaded, and unloaded in the designated dangerous (HOT)
     cargo areas (see Attachment 2).
     5.14.2. The following procedures will be implemented upon notification of inbound
     emergency aircraft with dangerous cargo aboard:
         5.14.2.1. Control Tower shall activate the PCAS if the aircraft declares and
         emergency, relaying all pertinent information (call sign, type aircraft, ETA, cargo,
         class number, and net explosive weight if known.) The control tower will relay any
         dangerous cargo information updates to AMOps.
         5.14.2.2. AMOps shall:
            5.14.2.2.1. Notify the following agencies/units, giving aircraft call sign, ETA or

            Center.
         5.14.2.3. Transient Alert personnel will ensure the aircraft is directed to and parked
         in the dangerous (HOT) cargo area.
  5.15. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Procedures.
     5.15.1. The reception of an ELT signal by the control tower or any agency will be treated
     as a possible aircraft accident/pilot ejection and will be handled accordingly, except the
     tower will not activate the PCAS.
     5.15.2. When an ELT signal is received or reported, the control tower will immediately
     notify Wing Command Post, AMOPs, and Tampa Approach Control.
     5.15.3. AMOPs will take action to locate and determine the source of the ELT signal and
     will advise the control tower of any results.
  5.16. Continuity of Air Traffic Services/Air Traffic Control Facility Evacuation.
     5.16.1. In accordance with HQ AMC policy, the 6th Operations Group Commander has
     determined that alternate air traffic control facilities are not required.
     5.16.2. In the event MacDill Tower personnel evacuate the facility, the aerodrome will
     be closed. Aircraft flight operations are restricted and aircraft shall divert. The airfield
     lighting system should be set to step 1 unless otherwise directed by FAAO 7110.65.
     5.16.3. The control tower can withstand winds up to 130 knots/150 miles per hour.
     Tower personnel will evacuate when winds reach 55 knots (steady or gusting) to building
     1161 if available, or Hangar 3.
     5.16.4. AMOps will evacuate to the DUC and continue operations. If the DUC is
