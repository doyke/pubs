This instruction establishes procedures for developing, reviewing, coordinating and publishing
Tinker AFB (TAFB) contingency plans. It applies to all TAFB organizations and units located at
TAFB. It implements the requirements of AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and
Execution, AFMC Supplement 1 to AFI 10-401, and AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, Planning
Formats and Guidance. Refer any changes to this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility, 72 ABW/XP, using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication, routed through the appropriate functional chain of command. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

With the publication of the AFMC instruction on Crisis Command and Control (C2) the Air
Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) will be responsible for the AFSC plans. This OI is therefore
revised to cover the management of TAFB plans only.
1. Background and Policy. AFMC Installation Commanders are responsible for planning and
executing installation-wide support to Air Force and AFMC contingency/crisis action operations.
The Installation Commander will designate a lead entity to be responsible for each of the
 2                                               TINKERAFBI10-401 25 NOVEMBER 2013


following installation-wide contingency planning functions: planning, training, exercising and
execution. The Wartime/Contingency Plans Division, 72 ABW/XPX, has been designated by
the Installation Commander, 72 ABW/CC, as the lead plans function for Tinker AFB. As such,
72 ABW/XPX is administratively responsible for all Installation level plans developed for
TAFB.
     1.1. This instruction is meant to be a guide to plan development and review. It does not
     replace or override higher headquarters (HHQ) guidance regarding specific plan format,
     guidance or review requirements.
     1.2. In accordance with AFMC Supplement 1 to AFI 10-401, Paragraph 3.5.3.4.6, the
     Installation lead plans office will be responsible for all Installation plan reviews. 72
     ABW/XPX and applicable plan OPRs will ensure all plans are reviewed every 12 months.
     72 ABW/XPX will maintain documentation on file from all plan Offices of Primary
     Responsibility (OPR) that certify the required reviews have been accomplished. The review
     process for TAFB Plan 10-403, Installation Deployment, must be accomplished IAW
     procedures established in AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution.
     1.3. Various special purpose Installation plans will be developed and managed by
     organizations other than 72 ABW/XPX. The OPR’s for these plans will be responsible for
     contacting the tasked organizations and requesting their plan be reviewed per Para 1.2,
     above. This does not negate the responsibility of 72 ABW/XPX for overall TAFB plan
     management. The following TAFB plans are managed by organizations other than 72
     ABW/XPX:
        1.3.1. TAFB Plan 10-403, Installation Deployment Plan (IDP) – 72 LRS.
        1.3.2. TAFB Plan 10-2, Installation Emergency Mgmt Plan (IEMP) – 72 ABW/CEX.
        1.3.3. BCE Plan 10-211, BCE Contingency Response Plan (CECRP) – 72 ABW/CEX.
        1.3.4. TAFB Plan 10-2604, Disease Containment Plan (DCP) – 72 MDG.
        1.3.5. TAFB Plan 10-404, Base Support & Expeditionary Site (BaS&E) - 72 LRS.
        1.3.6. TAFB Plan 19-2, Spill Prevention/Response – 72 ABW/CE.
        1.3.7. TAFB Plan 19-3, Wastewater Emergency Response – 72 ABW/CE.
        1.3.8. TAFB Plan 31-101, Integrated Defense Plan (IDP) – 72 SFS.
        1.3.9. TAFB Plan 32-1002, Snow and Ice Control – 72 ABW/CE.
        1.3.10. TAFB Plan 34-242, Mortuary Plan – 72 FSS
        1.3.11. TAFB Plan 36-3009, Family Readiness – 72 FSS.
        1.3.12. TAFB Plan 41-106, Medical Contingency Response (MCRP) – 72 MDG.
        1.3.13. TAFB Plan 91.1, Aircraft Mishap – 72 ABW/SE.
        1.3.14. TAFB Plan 91-2, Ground/Weapons Mishap – 72 ABW/SE.
        1.3.15. TAFB Plan 91-212, Bird-Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) – 72 ABW/SE.
     1.4. Installation plans will be assigned the same plan identification number as the AF/AFMC
     plan or directive it supports or implements. The supported instruction/plan will always be
TINKERAFBI10-401 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                              3


   shown as a reference in the installation plan. Per AFMC/A3X directions, the exceptions to
   this rule are TAFB Plans 8 and 17. If there is no specific supporting AFI, the plan number
   will reflect the general AFI category (Operations-10, Airfield Operations-13, Security-31,
   etc.).
   1.5. All installation plans must be coordinated with the 72d Air Base Wing Safety Office,
   72 ABW/SE, to ensure safety procedures are incorporated into every plan.
   1.6. The terms “base-level planning” and “installation-level” planning as used in AFI 10-401
   and the AFMC Supplement 1 are synonymous.
   1.7. The commander/director of each TAFB organization will appoint a primary and
   alternate plans representative to work planning issues for their unit. The name, office symbol
   and phone number of the organizational plans representative will be sent to 72 ABW/XPX.
   This individual will be the primary POC for all taskings and issues between 72 ABW/XPX
   and the unit when plans are being developed or updated. Required training is outlined in
   paragraph 6 below.
2. Plan Content. Depending on the subject of each plan, the OPR must ensure the plan contains
adequate provisions for implementing the following as needed:
   2.1. USAF Reporting Instructions (AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting).
   2.2. Emergency Actions and Alert Procedures (AFMC Emergency Action Plan).
   2.3. Post D-Day support requirements of associate organizations.
   2.4. Expansion or augmentation of command post operations.
   2.5. Alerting and operating the Crisis Action Team (CAT) or Emergency Operations Center
   (EOC) 24/7.
   2.6. Deployment plans in support of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) directed
   contingency operations.
   2.7. Support to civil authorities responding to man-made or natural disasters and acts of
   terrorism up to and including weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
   2.8. Emergency management plans and continuity of operations plans.
2.9. Changes in Force Protection Condition (FPCON).

3. Plan Formats. The general format given in AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, Planning Formats
and Guidance, will usually be followed for TAFB plans. The format shown in the AFMAN is
used for Operations Plans (OPlans) which are actual war plans supporting a Combatant
Commander. This format standardizes the content for plans and is easily followed for
installation level plans. The AFMAN specifies the exact annex each organization will use when
developing an OPlan (e.g. Annex D-Logistics, Annex S-Security, etc.).
   3.1. Since Installation plans do not always have a requirement for inputs from all units or
   require annexes for all subject areas, annexes may be modified to fit each plan’s need. The
   following items should be included in all plans:
       3.1.1. Plan transmittal memos using the AFMAN 10-401 format. This is signed by the
       appropriate commander (72 ABW/CC for TAFB plans).
 4                                                 TINKERAFBI10-401 25 NOVEMBER 2013


        3.1.2. Table of contents.
        3.1.3. Record of changes.
        3.1.4. Plan distribution list (Usually Annex Z).
     3.2. The paragraph headings within the plan (summary, basic plan and annexes) can be
     modified to meet the plan requirements. This includes “Situation”, “General”, “Mission”,
     ‘Execution”, “Tasks”, “Concept of Operations”, etc.
     3.3. Annexes supporting plans will be prepared by the appropriate functional OPR. These
     should be in the same format as the supported plan. If the HHQ supported document uses the
     “chapter outline” the supporting plans can use this same format. Also, if the supported
     document requires a specific format the plan will follow those instructions.
     3.4. Tasked organizations will prepare supporting checklists or instructions to outline their
     organization’s actions required to support the plan.
4. Plan Coordination/Approval. The following procedures should be followed for the
organizational coordination on the draft plan (new or review) and to obtain final approval and
signature on the plan transmittal memo by the appropriate commander.
     4.1. The plan OPR will develop or update their plan by requesting input for a new plan or by
     sending the draft/existing plan to all tasked organization’s plans OPR for review. Obvious
     changes such as published office symbol changes should be made to the existing plan before
     forwarding.
     4.2. The plan will be put in final draft format by the OPR using inputs from the tasked
     organizations. If necessary it may be returned to the tasked organization’s plans OPR for a
     final review if any of the information needs to be clarified. Any additional changes will be
     made to the final draft plan if required.
     4.3. The final draft plan will then be forwarded to each tasked organization’s appropriate
     management level for approval/coordination using an Electronic Staff Summary Sheet
     (eSSS) for his/her coordination.. If taskings are extensive for the organization the
     approval/coordination by the organization’s commander/director may be required. The
     signed eSSS will be returned to the plan OPR. Each wing/directorate/group is responsible
     for obtaining the coordination from all subordinate organizations within their organization.
     4.4. When all required coordination has been returned to the plan OPR, a final eSSS for 72
     ABW Commander’s approval/signature will be prepared. The transmittal memo (Tab 1), the
     plan (Tab 2) and the organizational eSSS’s with review comments (Tab 3) will be attached.
     Some TAFB plans that are too large to e-mail can be posted to 72 ABW SharePoint site.
     This will be noted on the eSSS. (Refer to the “AFSC Action Officer Information” under the
     “Administrative” tab on the TAFB Home Page for templates)
     4.5. After the Commander has signed the plan it will be returned to the plan OPR. A hard
     copy or electronic copy of the plan will then be forwarded to 72 ABW/XPX to file and post
     to the “Plans” folder on the Virtual Operations (VOC) SharePoint site                     at:
     https://cs.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/Tinker/72DVOC/default.aspx The plan OPR will include
     certification that all required coordination on taskings was accomplished by the tasked
     organizations and that the coordination documentation is retained on file. This can be copies
TINKERAFBI10-401 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                              5


   of the eSSS showing coordination by the tasked organizations. 72 ABW/XPX will keep this
   information on file.
   4.6. If the plan does not require complete rewrite during the annual review, the plan OPR
   must forward a memo to 72 ABW/XPX certifying that an annual review was conducted and
   provide a list of those organizations conducting the review. 72 ABW/XPX will keep this
   certification on file. The review memo with the data/date will be posted to the VOC with the
   plan.
   4.7. If a plan has major tasking changes but is not completely redone, the plan OPR must
   have the change memo and list of changes coordinated by the impacted tasked organizations
   and signed by the commander using the same procedures outlined in Paragraphs 4.1 – 4.5 ,
   above. The decision as to whether to completely re-publish a plan or to use a change memo
   is left up to the plan OPR, but usually a rewrite is accomplished when a significant number of
   administrative changes, new taskings or a major revision to the organization’s taskings
   occurs. This will depend on the number of required changes/corrections and their complexity.
   4.8. A copy of the change memo, review certification and a copy of the plan with the
   changes posted will be forwarded to 72 ABW/XPX. The memo and revised plan will then be
   posted to the VOC and the replaced version removed. For any hard copy of a plan the
   change memo will be filed as the first page of the plan and the change data will be entered in
   the “Change” page of the plan when the required changes are posted. The memo and other
   documentation will be filed by 72 ABW/XPX. A sample of a change memo to a plan is
   Attachment 3.
   4.9. The plan OPR will notify all tasked organization’s plans OPR’s and e-mail the
   organizational workflow mailbox that the new/updated plan is available and posted to the
   VOC at the link shown in paragraph 4.5. A read receipt should be used to ensure the tasked
   organizations received the information. The organizational OPR will ensure copies of the
   plan are made available to all tasked units.
5. Plan Timeliness. In order to review and update plans on the 12-month cycle, plan OPR’s
will need to begin the review process well before the plan anniversary date. The planner will
need to begin the process based on the plan’s previous review time and complexity of the plan.
   5.1. 30 to 60 days is the normal time required to complete the review process. However,
   larger plans such as 10-2, 31-101 and 10-2604 may take considerably more time for all
   tasked organizations to complete their review. Plan OPRs are ultimately responsible for the
   currency of their plans and ensuring they have been reviewed and/or updated/signed NLT the
   anniversary date of the original plan.
       5.1.1. Plan OPRs should establish a realistic suspense for the tasked organizations to
       complete their reviews. Suspense will depend on the size, complexity, and number of
       sub-organizations that have to review the plan taskings. The plan OPR may include the
       statement, “failure to respond by the suspense date will be taken as your organization’s
       concurrence.” However, if the organization’s input is critical to the plan and no response
       has been received by the suspense date the plan OPR should elevate this to their
       group/squadron commander/director for follow up to the non-responding organization’s
       commander/director. If there is still no response to the review request, 72 ABW/XP will
       be notified and the request may be elevated to the Wing Commander for action.

     5.2. The status of TAFB plans will be reported to 72 ABW/CC on a regular basis. This
     includes current plans, those in coordination and plans being worked by organizations. It is
     the goal of the 72 ABW to have 80% of the installation plans current at all times. Plan OPRs
     will capture metric data on the plan review process for the status report to the Commander.
     This will include review start date, when tasked organizations responded, when coordination
     completed, time it was forwarded for 72 ABW/CC signature, etc.
6. Planner Meetings/Training.
     6.1. 72 ABW/XPX will host planner meetings quarterly to discuss planning issues, problems
     and exercises. These sessions can also be used to train newly appointment planning
     personnel. Out of cycle meetings may be called to discuss special issues or exercise
     requirements if needed. 6.2. The Contingency Wartime Planners Course (CWPC) is
     available to teach the basic planning process to war planners at all levels. The depth of
     instruction is sufficient to bring students to a level of comprehension that enables them to
     carry out their duties more effectively.
        6.2.1. HQ AFMC/A3X is the MAJCOM course manager for the AF CWPC.
        6.2.2. The Installation Deployment Office in the 72d Logistics Readiness Squadron (72
        LRS) is the installation OPR for requesting/scheduling student spaces for the CWPC.
        When the AFMC course manager notifies the 72 LRS course manager that a space is
        available he/she will contact installation planners who have not had the course and offer
        them the space. Spaces are usually allotted by quotas requested during the previous year.
