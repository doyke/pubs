This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 34-2, Managing
Nonappropriated Funds. It extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 34-246, Air
Force Lodging Program. It provides guidance and procedures on Unit Training Assembly
(UTA) procedures for March Air Reserve Base (ARB) Lodging. It is designed to provide an
efficient and effective lodging process on UTA weekends. It applies to 452 AMW and associated
units, 4th Air Force (AF) and 163d Reconnaissance Wing (RW) UTA training staff, orderly
rooms and schedulers. The goal of this instruction is to maximize occupancy in government
quarters and eliminate no-show costs. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force Form (AF Form)

                                         Chapter 1

                                   RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Unit Lodging Point of Contact (POC). Each unit is responsible for appointing a Unit
Lodging Point of Contact (ULPOC). Primary ULPOCs must be full-time employees, to be able
to work lodging issues, and validate lodging rosters during the week. Alternate ULPOCs may be
traditional Reserve or Guard personnel who will work issues on UTA weekends. Changes to
ULPOCs must be forwarded, in writing, to the March Inn, whenever there is a change in
designation.
    1.1.1. The Unit Lodging POC is responsible for working all lodging requirements with the
    Lodging Office.
1.2. Lodging Office. The Lodging Office will provide the ULPOC with no-show listings by
Wednesday, following the respective UTA.
    1.2.1. The Unit Lodging POC’s will validate the no-show listing and advise Lodging of any
    errors.

                                       PROCEDURES

2.1. UTA Roster. On the Monday following UTAs, all respective units will provide the March
Inn Lodging Office with the signed, standardized generic lodging roster listing. The roster
should reflect only those members residing outside the non-commute area, and who will require
lodging for the next month’s UTA.
   2.1.1. The ULPOC will ensure that personnel requiring lodging sign and annotate the roster
   with the number of nights for lodging required.
   2.1.2. Three (3) days prior to the scheduled UTA, the ULPOC will revalidate the roster, in
   writing, with any additions or deletions. Any changes after the validation will be treated as
   walk-ins.
   2.1.3. Members who have signed the roster for the prior month, and whose unit is assigned
   to a commercial hotel, can go directly to the hotel. The payment voucher (call slip) will have
   been provided to the hotel. There is no need to report to the March Inn.
   2.1.4. Members who are on Mandays will be given equal status for on base rooms. Members
   will “roll” into a UTA need to ensure their ULPOC notifies lodging of the correct status of
   their orders, as soon as possible. The dates and status changes are necessary to avoid “double
   booking” for the same individual. Every effort will be made to leave the individual in place
   for the duration of their tours.

                                            Chapter 3

                             HOTEL PAYMENT GUARANTEES

3.1 Payments to The Hotel for Friday Night Room Reservations. These are guaranteed with
the exception of those rooms canceled by the ULPOC or Lodging, by 1800 on Friday Night
3.1. 1. Saturday night reservations are guaranteed, but only held until 1800. Members desiring a
late (after 1800) check-in must contact lodging or contract hotel and guarantee late arrival with
his/her personal credit card. Upon check-in, the room reservation will convert to “unit pay”.
However, should an individual, after extending a room reservation with a personal credit card
fail to show, lodging/contract hotel will charge that individual’s credit card with no expectation
of reimbursement.
3.2. Double Buy-Out. “Double Buy-outs” are not permitted during UTAs. A “Double Buy-
Out” occurs when one person scheduled to share a room with another unit member, pays the
hotel “out of pocket”, for the second half of the room; for example, to accommodate a spouse
during the UTA weekend. Double Buy-Outs cause the second unit member to return to Lodging
for alternate accommodations and it increases 452 AMW lodging costs.
3.3. Double Bookings. 452 AMW members are not to make reservations directly with
commercial hotels and then report to Lodging. This results in double bookings and double billing
for a no-show, at one or the other locations. Individuals are not authorized to procure their own
accommodation, unless at their own expense, and with prior Lodging coordination.
3.4. Cactus Flight. The Cactus Flight is a training mission that is also used to transport our
UTA reservists living around the Phoenix, AZ and Las Vegas, NV areas. As a result of air travel,
those members have no vehicle transportation, and are consequently quartered on base. The
mission arrives on UTA Friday nights and departs Sundays around 1630.
    3.4.1. This free airlift is not a guarantee, and if regular Cactus riders, for any reason, do not
    arrive via this flight (i.e. they drive to the UTA), they can no longer be considered a Cactus
    Flight participant, and will only be eligible for any room assignment available, whether it is
    on or off base.
3.5. Walk-Ins. Members who do not sign the Unit Lodging Roster or have not had their
ULPOC validate the member’s UTA intentions three (3) days prior to the respective UTA are
considered walk-ins. Per AFI 34-246, Air Force Lodging Program, para 3.1, Air Force Reserve
Command(AFRC) members are required to make advanced lodging reservations. Members who
walk in without making reservations may still utilize government quarters, however, the
wing/unit of assignment will not pay for lodging of members who fail to comply with this
directive. (EXCEPTION: New recruits, members returning from long deployments, etc). It is the
Wing Lodging POCs responsibility to ensure that all members are aware of and in compliance
with this policy. Walk-in members will be housed after 1400 on the day of arrival.
3.5.1 With the exception of the 163 RW, all members who are not included on the unit roster
and who are scheduled for the UTA, will need to appear physically at the Lodging Front Desk
after 1400.
452AMWI34-205 23 JULY 2009                                                                         5


       3.5.1.1. A military Identification card, validation letter, or AF Form 40A, Record of
       Individual Inactive Duty Training and a signature are required prior to any room
       assignment being offered by the desk.
           3.5.1.1.1. The only exception to this policy is a newcomer attending their first UTA.
           In this case, every attempt will be made to accommodate the newcomer on base.
3.6. No-Show Listing. The Lodging Office will provide the ULPOC with no-show listings by
Wednesday following the respective UTA. The ULPOC will validate the no-show listing and
advise the Lodging Office of any errors.
   3.6.1. The 452 AMW, 4 AF and 163 RW units will be responsible in most cases, for paying
   for rooms not used, as a result of no-shows.
       3.6.1.1. Exception: a member who called to ensure a Saturday night hotel extension, with
       their personal credit card and fails to show (see para. 2.2.2.) In this case, lodging/hotel
       will charge the member’s personal card for payment.
       3.6.1.2. First no show status validated by the ULPOC; the member will receive a
       warning.
       3.6.1.3. Second no show status validated by the Lodging POC; member’s lodging
       privileges will be suspended for 6 months.
       3.6.1.4. ULPOC must document and forward no show information to 1st Sergeants who
       will review, take appropriate action and forward documentation to 452 AMW/CCC.
       Suspension of privileges documentation must be forwarded to 452 AMW/CC.
3.7. Cancellations. It is the member’s responsibility to cancel their reservation through the
respective ULPOC prior to a scheduled UTA. If they are not available, please e-mail Lodging at:
lodging.cancellations@march.af.mil prior to 1600 hours on UTA Fridays.
3.8. Rescheduled UTA.         Reservations must be requested through your ULPOC. Verification
from the unit is required.
3.9. Lodging Front Desk numbers: (951) 655-5241, (951) 653-3174 Lodging Worldwide
Phone Number: 1-888-AFLODGE (1-888-235-6343) (Follow the instructions on the voice
message to reach any base).

and/or disciplinary action.
