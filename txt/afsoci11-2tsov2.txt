                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Objectives. The Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Program is the
commander’s tool to validate mission readiness and the effectiveness of unit flying, to include
documentation of individual aircrew member qualifications and capabilities.
1.2. General. This instruction establishes requirements and grading criteria for ground and
flight phases of initial and periodic flight evaluations. All TSO aircrew evaluations will be
conducted IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as supplemented. Specific areas for
evaluation are prescribed to ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of
aircrews. Flight examiners use this instruction when conducting aircrew evaluations. Instructors
use this instruction when preparing aircrews for qualification. AFSOC is lead MAJCOM for
TSO operations. (T-2)
1.3. Applicability. This instruction applies to any operator acting in the capacity of a TSO on
USAF aircraft or other aircraft as required.
1.4. Keywords and Definitions.
     1.4.1. “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.4.2. “Should” is used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.4.3. “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.4.4. “Note” indicates operations procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
     emphasize.
1.5. Waivers. IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, AF/A3OT is the waiver authority for the USAF aircrew
standardization and evaluation programs. Waiver authority for the contents of this document is
MAJCOM Director of Operations, A3 for individual aircrew requirements. Submit requests for
waivers to this instruction through Standards and Evaluation channels to HQ AFSOC/A3V. Post
all waivers to this instruction in the individual’s flight evaluation folder behind Tab 2.
Document waivers IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as supplemented.
     1.5.1. Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk.
        1.5.1.1. “Tier 0” (T-0) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
        is determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority.
        1.5.1.2. “Tier 1” (T-1) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
        may put airman, mission, or program strongly at risk, and may only be waived by the
        MAJCOM/CC or delegate with concurrence of publication approver. When multiple
        MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate.
        1.5.1.3. “Tier 2” (T-2) requirements are reserved for requirements that potentially put
        the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission or program, and may only be
        waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate.
AFSOCI11-2TSOV2 27 MARCH 2014                                                                     5


       1.5.1.4. “Tier 3” (T-3) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
       has a remote risk of mission failure, and may be waived by the Wing/CC but no lower
       than the OG/CC.
1.6. Roles and Responsibilities.
   1.6.1. HQ AFSOC/A3V is the functional lead for this document and will:
   1.6.1.1. Ensure subordinate organizations comply with contents.
       1.6.1.2. Coordinate updates to content.
   1.6.2. HQ AFSOC /A3 is the waiver authority for the contents of this document.
   1.6.3. Special Operations Wings (SOW), Groups (SOG), and Squadrons (SOS and IS) will:
   (T-2)
       1.6.3.1. Ensure unit standardization and evaluation organizations serve as the unit Office
       of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for unit document adherence.
       1.6.3.2. Collect and route data for document updates.
1.7. Supplements. Units are encouraged to supplement this instruction with standard evaluation
profiles that best fit the unit’s mission, equipment, and location. Subordinate units will forward
any recommended supplements or changes to 361 ISR Group. (T-2)
1.8. Evaluation Procedures. During the crew briefing, the evaluator will inform the aircraft
commander of any special requirements. Flight examiners will brief the examinee on the
conduct, purpose, and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation criteria,
prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish all required mission planning. If an Operations
Planning Team or Deployment Planning Team accomplishes mission planning, the examinee is
ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all mission-planning paperwork.
Flight examiners will be furnished a copy of necessary charts, flight logs, mission folders, and
any additional items they deem necessary. The flight examiner should not occupy a primary
crew position during evaluations to ensure the most comprehensive evaluation. If conditions
warrant, however, the flight examiner may occupy a primary crew position during an evaluation.
(T-2)
   1.8.1. Flight examiners will ensure all required training and documentation is complete prior
   to initial/requalification evaluations. (T-2)
   1.8.2. The examinee will be current for all events evaluated during a recurring evaluation.
   (T-2)
   1.8.3. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
   but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight. (T-2)
   1.8.4. Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight. During the
   critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations,
   area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required. (T-2)
1.9. Instructor Certified Events. These are events that require certification of training by an
instructor or flight examiner. Document certification on the AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew
Certifications, IAW 11-202, Vol 2, AFSOC Sup, and file in the individual's Flight Evaluation
 6                                                       AFSOCI11-2TSOV2 27 MARCH 2014


Folder (FEF) behind Tab 1. Refer to AFSOCI 11-2TSO, Vol 1, Aircrew Training, for a current
listing of instructor certified events.
1.10. Grading Instructions. All evaluations will follow the guidelines in AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as
supplemented, and this instruction. Examiners will use the criteria in this volume to accomplish
all flight, simulator, and emergency procedures evaluations. To ensure standard and objective
evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with prescribed evaluation criteria. (T2)
     1.10.1. Area/Subarea Grades. Areas/subareas will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level
     (Q/Q-/ U) grading system. Discrepancies will be documented against the listed subareas.
        1.10.1.1. Q. ‘Q’ indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
        all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed tolerances.
        1.10.1.2. Q-. ‘Q-’ indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned
        area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the
        flight examiner. Deviations will not exceed prescribed ‘Q-’ tolerances, jeopardize flight
        safety, or breach flight discipline. (T-2)
        1.10.1.3. U. ‘U’ indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters, thereby
        compromising flight safety; that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
        adversely affected mission accomplishment; and/or evaluated performance constituted a
        breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade of ‘U’ requires
        debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight examiner.
     1.10.2. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew
     member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member
     receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will
     also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by “Critical” in the area title. (T-2)
1.11. Evaluation Requirements. Evaluation profiles will reflect a sampling of the unit’s
missions. Evaluation tables are provided to summarize evaluation areas. Areas common to all
crew members are contained in Table 2.1. Instructor evaluation areas are in Table 3.1. Events
required in-flight only, and/or in simulators, and/or alternate methods (see Paragraph 1.10.1
below) will be identified in the tables. For any areas without a note, flight examiners may
evaluate at their discretion if observed. If required events are not observed, then the evaluation is
incomplete and will be accomplished on another flight. If a required event cannot be
accomplished, the evaluator will place a restriction on the AF Form 8a, Certificate of Aircrew
Qualification (Multiple Aircraft), as applicable. (T-2)
     1.11.1. Simulator. Weapon System Trainers (WSTs) with a C or greater certification (or
     Training Value Code (TVC) of 3 or greater for all areas evaluated as determined by simulator
     certification (SIMCERT)) may be used to accomplish evaluations. Simulator certifications
     will be located at the HQ AFSOC/A3T website. Use the prefix SIM to indicate evaluation
     was administered in the simulator or Aircrew Training Device (ATD). Do not conduct two
     consecutive combined QUAL/MSN evaluations in the simulator. All initial evaluations will
     be accomplished in the aircraft. (T-2)
        1.11.1.1. Document evaluations requiring multiple sorties IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as
        supplemented. Document in the comments section of AF Form 8a which portion(s) of
        the evaluation were conducted in the simulator.
AFSOCI11-2TSOV2 27 MARCH 2014                                                                 7


   1.11.2. Alternate Method. When it is impossible to evaluate an area in-flight due to
   equipment malfunctions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, etc., the area may
   be evaluated via alternate method (procedural trainer, or verbal examination) unless noted.
   If, in the flight examiner’s judgment, an item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate
   method, complete the evaluation on an additional flight. Document in the comments section
   of AF Form 8a which portions of the evaluation were conducted via alternate method.
   Exception: Certain items listed in Table 2.1 and Table 3.1 may be evaluated via alternate
   method without additional AF Form 8a comments.
   1.11.3. Grading Criteria. To the maximum extent possible, flight examiners will use the
   grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area grades. Exercise judgment when
   the wording of areas is subjective and when specific areas are not covered. Flight examiner
   judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade. Consider cumulative
   deviations when determining the overall grade. (T-2)
       1.11.3.1. Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a
       stable aircraft. In some cases, momentary deviations are allowable provided the
       examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying
       safety.
1.12. Unsatisfactory Performance. If the flight examiner observes the examinee jeopardizing
safe flight, the examiner will assume the duties of that aircrew member (provided the examiner’s
flight duty period does not exceed AFI 11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules, maximum flight
duty period for an unaugmented crew). This does not mean the examiner will assume the
examinee's position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed. If the examiner feels the
examinee can continue safely with supervision, the examiner is not required to assume the
examinee's duties. However, if the flight examiner assumes the examinee's duties, a
Qualification Level 3 (Q-3) will be assigned as the overall grade. (T-2)
   1.12.1. Evaluators     will    report     deviations/discrepancies from     established
   procedures/directives in any area, regardless of the individual's crew specialty, to
   squadron/group commander as required for evaluation and necessary action in accordance
   with AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as supplemented. (T2)
1.13. Additional Training. Flight examiners are responsible for assigning additional training,
at their discretion. Document additional training and completion IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as
supplemented. Any approved training device or medium may be used for additional training.
   1.13.1. Additional training may be accomplished on the same flight as the evaluation, when
   unique situations present valuable training opportunities. However, this option requires
   flight examiner discretion and judicious application. The examinee will be informed when
   the additional training begins and ends. (T-2)
1.14. Rechecks. Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the
one who administered the original evaluation.
1.15. Instructors.
   1.15.1. Instructor will be qualified in all sub-areas they will instruct. (T-2)
 8                                                        AFSOCI11-2TSOV2 27 MARCH 2014


     1.15.2. Instructor will be evaluated on instructor performance during a representative sample
     of procedures. Instructors will have a solid understanding of systems, procedures, and
     techniques. (T-2)
     1.15.3. Instructor requalification evaluations may be combined with the basic requalification
     evaluation.
     1.15.4. There are no requisites for initial instructor evaluations. Requisites for periodic
     evaluations administered to qualified instructors will be completed IAW the requirements for
     the type (QUAL/MSN) evaluation being administered. (T-2)
     1.15.5. Conduct evaluation of instructor ability during all subsequent periodic evaluations
     following the INIT INSTR evaluation.
1.16. Flight Examiners.
     1.16.1. Evaluators will be instructor qualified in a given event prior to acting as an evaluator
     in the event. (T-2)
     1.16.2. Certified evaluators who subsequently add special mission instructor or other
     instructor qualifications are automatically certified to evaluate these new qualifications.
1.17. Verbal Evaluation of Sub-Areas.
     1.17.1. Make every effort to evaluate all sub-areas through actual performance. When this is
     not possible, evaluate the sub-areas verbally.
     1.17.2. Areas prohibited from verbal evaluation are listed in the specific crew position
     chapter of this instruction.
     1.17.3. The unit chief of Stan/Eval, flight examiner or squadron commander decides if the
     evaluation is complete.
1.18. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). All aircrew members are responsible for
understanding and applying proper emergency action procedures applicable to their crew
position. EPEs may be performed in-flight, in an ATD, or verbally.
1.19. Evaluation Forms. The prescribed form for annotating flight evaluation areas/sub-areas
and grades/notes is the AFSOC Form 48 TSQ, Tactical Systems Operator Flight Evaluation

                             EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General. The general criteria contained in this chapter apply to all crew positions and all
evaluations. Use criteria and table in the appropriate crew position chapters for evaluations.
   2.1.1. All evaluations will follow guidelines in AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as supplemented, and
   Table 2.1 in this volume. This table depicts specific grading areas that apply to all crew
   position evaluations; Table 3.1 applies to all instructor evaluations. (T-2)
   2.1.2. Administer aircrew evaluations on any flight that as scheduled will accomplish all
   required items for that evaluation. Mission evaluations should be as realistic as possible with
   minimum of simulated events. Do not deviate from peacetime restrictions.
2.2. Requirements.
   2.2.1. Evaluate all crew members with guidance in the following subparagraphs, Table 2.1
   and Table 4.1. For instructor evaluations, also see Table 3.1.
   2.2.2. Examinations. All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations
   as a requisite to periodic evaluations. Conduct requisite examinations IAW AFI 11-202, Vol
   2, as supplemented. Additionally, TSOs will complete open/closed examinations for all
   aircraft on which they are currently qualified. In requalification training, TSOs will complete
   examinations for all aircraft on which they were formerly qualified, unless directed otherwise
   by SQ/CC. If examinations are not completed, the TSO will lose qualification on all
   airframes not tested. (T-2)
   2.2.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). EPEs are requisites for all flight
   evaluations. EPEs may be conducted verbally, in-flight, in a simulator, or by another method
   determined     by the        examiner  or    unit    Stan/Eval.         Operations     Group
   Standardization/Evaluations (OGV) may develop EPE guides for flight examiner use in each
   crew position. EPEs should be scenario-driven, and tailored to the specific crew position.
   The EPE will include areas commensurate with the examinee's qualification and experience
   level. Emphasize emergency procedures and systems knowledge. Examiners should include
   other general knowledge areas as well. EPEs will include sufficient in-flight and ground
   emergencies to evaluate the examinee's knowledge of systems and procedures to the flight
   examiner's satisfaction. (T-2)
       2.2.3.1. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The
       examinee will recite all CAPs/ BOLDFACE (as required by MDS) items from memory
       and should provide the initial steps of emergency procedures that, in the opinion of the
       examiner, would not allow time for reference. (T-2)
       2.2.3.2. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs for
       all crew positions. The flight examiner will assign an overall EPE grade (1, 2, or 3) in
       the Qualification Ground Phase block of the AF Form 8/8A, regardless whether all or a
       portion of the EPE was performed in-flight. Exception: For BOLDFACE use grading
       criteria in Area 4. (T-2)

2.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290,
Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, CRM skills will be evaluated during
initial and periodic evaluations. CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight; therefore no
specific area titled CRM exists. CRM skills are imbedded within specific grading criteria
(mission planning, airmanship/ situational awareness (SA), crew coordination, communication,
risk management/decision making, task management, and briefing/debriefing) and include all of
the skills listed on the AF Form 4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation Form.
Therefore, use of the AF Form 4031 is unnecessary for evaluations. (T-2)
2.4. Formal Course Evaluations. Fly syllabus evaluations IAW syllabus mission profile
guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives. All
required areas will be evaluated for the type of evaluation being flown, IAW guidance in this
instruction. Grade training objectives and related areas using the performance criteria in this
volume. Formal course guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or
examiner judgment, to complete the evaluation. (T-2)
