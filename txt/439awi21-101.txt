This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance, and AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. It establishes

taxi programs. It applies to the 439th Operations Group Commander (439 OG/CC), Airfield
Management, Command Post, and all Maintenance Group (439 MXG) work centers. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises 439AWI21-101 by adding the statement, “Enter data into FCF
feature in QANTTAS for tracking purposes.” This statement is to be placed in between the
statements “maintain a copy of AF Form 2400 for deficiency and trend analysis” and “If the FCF
was unsuccessful, this coordination will be re-accomplished in its entirety” to attachment 2; C-5
Functional Check Flight Coordination Checklist.
1. General. The 439th Maintenance Group Quality Assurance (439 MXG/MXQ) and the
applicable Aircraft Maintenance Squadron or Maintenance Squadron superintendent will
 2                                                              439AWI21-101 24 JUNE 2010


evaluate aircraft maintenance activities to determine if a Functional Check Flight (FCF) or
Operational Check Flight (OCF) is required before returning an aircraft to regular service.
Aircraft being recovered from cannibalization status, isochronal inspections, Contract or Depot
Field Team, or other major repair will be evaluated to determine if a FCF or OCF is required
based on the type and degree of maintenance performed.
2. FCF.
     2.1. FCFs will be conducted as determined by requirements in Technical Order (T.O.) 1-1-
     300, Acceptance/Functional Check Flights and Maintenance Operational Checks, 1C-5A-6,
     Aircraft Scheduled Inspections, and as directed by the 439th Maintenance Group Commander
     (439 MXG/CC).
     2.2. Westover ARB aircrews are not qualified to perform FCFs. When it becomes necessary
     to accomplish an FCF at Westover, the 439 MXG/CC will coordinate with Robins AFB, GA
     to schedule it.
     2.3. The 439 MXG/MXQ Office and the applicable maintenance flight chief will serve as
     the focal point to brief the FCF aircrew on matters concerning the discrepancies and/or
     conditions prompting the necessity of the FCF.
     2.4. The 439 MXG/MXQ will utilize the FCF Checklist (Attachment 2) and maintain an
     information file for briefing aircrews, ensure aircraft Weight and Balance (W&B) documents
     are reviewed prior to FCF, and document all FCF / OCF in Quality Assurance Tracking and
     Trend Analysis System (QANTTAS).
3. OCF.
     3.1. OCFs will be conducted as determined by requirements in applicable Time Compliance
     Technical Orders 1C-5A-2 and 1C-5A-6, or as directed by the 439MXG/CC.
     3.2. The 439 MXG/MXQ Supervisor and the applicable maintenance flight chief will serve
     as the focal point for contact between the Maintenance Group and the Operations Group to
     discuss requirements of OCFs. On the day of the OCF a member of the 439 MXG/MXQ
     office will brief the OCF aircrew on the requirements for the OCF and/or conditions
     prompting the need for the OCF.
     3.3. The Maintenance Group Plans Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D) Supervisor will
     provide the 439 OG a minimum of 24 hours notification to ensure a smooth transition and for
     scheduling the most qualified aircrew to complete the required checks. The PS&D supervisor
     will also coordinate and schedule OCFs with the 439 OG/CC.
     3.4. The 439 OG, Standardization/Evaluation section, will assign a qualified aircrew to
     accomplish the required OCF and will meet, if necessary, with the 439 MXG/MXQ
     Supervisor to discuss the requirements of the OCF.
