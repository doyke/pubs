MACDILLAFBI91-212 8 NOVEMBER 2011                                                          5


     2.9.5. Conduct bird dispersal in accordance with this instruction and Air Force Pamphlet
     (AFPAM) 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management
     Techniques, utilizing the following mitigation methods when required:
        2.9.5.1. Harassment. Make the airfield stressful and inhospitable for unwanted bird
        species through the use of canines without damaging any protected wetland habitat.
        2.9.5.2. Depredation. Studies show that wildlife becomes accustomed to harassment
        techniques that are used over a period of time. In order to associate harassment
        techniques with mortality, at times it may become necessary to use depredation
        techniques to ensure harassment techniques remain effective.
        2.9.5.3. Pyrotechnic equipment (pistols with 12 gauge insert, airburst shells, and 12
        gauge scare cartridges) and any other bio-acoustic pyrotechnic equipment necessary
        for bird control. Personnel assigned will maintain proficiency on above devices.
        2.9.5.4. Remote-controlled vehicles.
     2.9.6. Collect data concerning bird activity and provide a migratory survey and monthly
     reports of this activity to 6 AMW/SE.
        2.9.6.1. Bird Data Collection. Information on birds gathered empirically by 6 AMW
        agencies and Florida Fish and Wildlife, such as the following, aids in minimizing
        exposure to bird activity:
            2.9.6.1.1. Number and type of bird flights.
            2.9.6.1.2. Approximate time of flights.
            2.9.6.1.3. Types of control methods used.
            2.9.6.1.4. Result of those activities.
            2.9.6.1.5. Types and number of animals killed.
            2.9.6.1.6. Suggestions for habitat management.
            2.9.6.1.7. Any other information pertinent to MacDill AFB flying safety.
     2.9.7. Notify 6 OSS/OSAA (Airfield Management) before beginning any off-duty period
     to ensure positive transfer of responsibility for dispersal efforts in accordance with
     paragraph 2.10.7.
  2.10. 6 OSS/OSAA will:
     2.10.1. Declare or downgrade BWC/BW Alert in accordance with paragraph 4.4.2.
        2.10.1.1. Notify Command Post of BWC changes and bird strikes.
     2.10.2. Monitor conditions during airfield inspections that might present a bird strike
     hazard. Inspections will normally take place in BASH areas A and B (annotated in
     Attachment 2). Immediate hazards will be reported to the 6 AMW/CP during periods of
     normal flying operations. Airfield Management Operations will then coordinate BWC
     with the 6 OSS/OSAT.
     2.10.3. Receive reports of bird activity from any source.

    2.10.4. Issue airfield BWC advisories as declared. Also, issue a local Notice to Airmen
    (NOTAM) when a BW Alert is activated to include time window for the alert, if
    available, and reason (i.e., mowing operations, migration period, sunrise/sunset activity,
    etc.).
    2.10.5. Record unusual bird activity or bird-aircraft strike(s) by transient aircrews and
    report this information to 6 AMW/SEF.
    2.10.6. Observe environmental conditions in the runway vicinity that could attract birds
    and report them to Pest Management QAE (6 CES/CEOHHE), Commercial 813-828-
    2991, DSN 968-2991.
    2.10.7. Airfield Management (6 OSS/OSAA) will be the OPR for bird dispersal when 6
    AMW/SEFB is not on duty. Conduct bird dispersal in accordance with this instruction
    and AFPAM 91-212, utilizing the following mitigation methods when required:
       2.10.7.1. Harassment. Use pyrotechnic equipment (pistols with 12 gauge insert,
       airburst shells, and 12 gauge scare cartridges) and any other bio-acoustic pyrotechnic
       equipment necessary for bird control. Personnel assigned will maintain proficiency
       on above devices.
       2.10.7.2. Grounds maintenance. Airfield grass height will be maintained to a
       minimum of 7 inches and a maximum of 14 inches to discourage bird activity and
       habitation. The BHWG will establish and review airfield-designated boundaries as
       required. During the rainy season, grass is allowed to exceed 14 inches in low-lying
       areas when the mowers create ruts on the airfield. At the end of the rainy season,
       grounds maintenance will reinstitute normal grass cutting procedures.
       2.10.7.3. Habitat modification. Meetings and conversations will continue with local
       Fish and Wildlife representatives, Base Civil Engineer, Base Agronomist, and
       Environmental Management to discourage activities that attract birds to the local area.
       These include, but are not limited to, seed crop planting in fields around approach and
       departure corridors, landfill operations, and industrial operations that create standing
       water.
       2.10.7.4. Depredation.     Studies show that wildlife becomes accustomed to
       harassment techniques that are used over a period of time. In order to associate
       harassment techniques with mortality, at times it may become necessary to use
       depredation techniques to ensure harassment techniques remain effective.
       2.10.7.5. Collect data concerning bird activity and provide a migratory survey and
       monthly reports of this activity to 6 AMW/SE.
           2.10.7.5.1. Bird Data Collection. Information on birds gathered empirically by
           MacDill AFB agencies and Florida Fish and Wildlife, such as the following, aids
           in minimizing exposure to bird activity:
               2.10.7.5.1.1. Peak concentration by species of bird.
               2.10.7.5.1.2. Radar and visual sighting by time of day.
               2.10.7.5.1.3. Bird aircraft strike incidents at MacDill AFB.
MACDILLAFBI91-212 8 NOVEMBER 2011                                                               7


                2.10.7.5.1.4. Weather conditions.
                2.10.7.5.1.5. Bird flying activity (soaring, transitioning, feeding, etc.).
  2.11. 6 OSS/OST (Operations Training) will:
     2.11.1. Issue specific guidance for 6 AMW aircrews on procedures to be followed under
     BWC on the airfield in accordance with Air Mobility Command, Directorate of
     Operations (AMC/A3) guidance.
     2.11.2. Publish BASH considerations and guidance in AFI                              11-2KC-
     135V3_MACDILLAFBSUP, C/KC-135 Operations Procedures, for BWC.
     2.11.3. Coordinate with Standardization and Evaluation (6 OG/OGV) to ensure BASH
     procedures are covered during aircrew flight briefings as necessary.
  2.12. 6 OSS Control Tower (6 OSS/OSAT) will:
     2.12.1. Declare or downgrade a BWC or BW Alert in accordance with paragraph 4.2.
     2.12.2. Remain alert for bird activity on, over, or near the airfield.
     2.12.3. Inform Tampa Approach Control and Airfield Management Operations of bird
     activity and changes in the BWC.
     2.12.4. Include the BIRD WATCH information in the Airport Terminal Information
     System (ATIS) broadcast.
     2.12.5. Relay verbatim any instructions from the Command Post to aircraft under their
     control (i.e., divert or holding instructions).
     2.12.6. Provide 6 AMW/SEFB and 6 OSS/OSAA personnel access to the runway during
     BIRDWATCH conditions in line with safe aircraft operations if bird dispersal is
     necessary.
     2.12.7. Notify Airfield Management Operations when aircraft are conducting practice
     approaches at MacDill (instrument flight rules (IFR) and visual flight rules (VFR)). This
     includes all aircraft (base assigned or transient).
         2.12.7.1. Notify Airfield Management Operations 10 minutes prior to the first aircraft
         beginning approach and again when the last aircraft has departed the area.
     2.12.8. Notify mowers operating near the runway (BASH Inspection Areas A and B on
     Attachment 2) five minutes prior, or as soon as possible thereafter, of any aircraft arrival
     and/or departure. If the aircraft is a full stop arrival or a departure outbound, all mowers
     will be directed to cease operations near the runway and move toward Taxiway G (if on
     the ramp side) or the tree line (if on the Tower side) to a distance at least 200 feet away
     from the runway edge and turn off all mowers until advised that mowing operations may
     resume. If arriving or departing aircraft will conduct multiple approaches, Tower will
     advise the mowers of approximate delay due to pattern work. If lengthy (TBD by mower
     operator), mowers will concentrate their efforts on parts of the airfield outside of 200 feet
     of the runway and away from the arrival/departure corridors. These procedures will
     mitigate the hazard associated with birds following the mowers to prey on insects stirred
     up by the mowers.

       2.13.1. 6th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (6 AMXS) will:
           2.13.1.1. Ensure Wing Safety has the opportunity to investigate any damaging bird
           strikes before clean up and repair.
           2.13.1.2. Make arrangements to gather and preserve evidence of blood smears and/or
           non-fleshy remains of bird strike(s) until Squadron or Wing Safety assumes
           responsibility of it in accordance with this instruction.
           2.13.1.3. Ensure any evidence of a bird-aircraft strike found after the crew has
           departed is forwarded promptly to maintenance debrief. 6 AMXS will forward
           evidence to 6 AMW/SEF as soon as possible. If maintenance personnel notice a bird
           strike that was not reported by the aircrew, they must notify the Maintenance
           Operation Center immediately.
           2.13.1.4. Determine initial cost estimates and damages caused by the bird strike and
           forward information to Wing Safety.

      2.16.2. Provide data to Wing Safety concerning bird migration periods and bird activity
      at least quarterly.
3. Specific Hazards.
   3.1. General: Specific bird hazards and hazard reduction plans for the MacDill AFB area
   include:
   3.2. Turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) and black vulture (Coragyps atratus).
      3.2.1. Hazard: This species is the most serious threat to aircraft operations at MacDill
      AFB. This dense and heavy species (average 3-4.3 pounds) can be seen soaring in a
      circular motion in numbers from one to a few hundred over open areas of the flight line.
      They soar at altitudes of 50 to 3000 feet. Turkey vultures are carrion feeders and circle
      the flight line searching for food. This primary threat comes from small to large flocks
      circling the runway approaches and other open areas of the pattern, especially during
      early to late afternoon during the months of October to February.
      3.2.2. Hazard Reduction: The airfield and other open areas of the pattern should be
      closely monitored for their activity and appropriate advisories should be transmitted as
      required. During the months of October through February, flying during early to late
      afternoon should be done only after checking for the presence of flocks in the open areas
      of the pattern. Every effort should be taken to check the airfield every morning for dead
      animals. Birds circling over a specific area provide a common visual indication of where
      a possible dead animal may be found. All dead trees and unneeded manmade structures
      should be removed from the airfield.
   3.3. Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis).
      3.3.1. Hazard: This protected species can be seen frequently on the catwalk of the
      approach lighting for runway 04 and in the drainage ditches near taxiway H. It also flies
      in small flocks (3-6 birds) in varied formations. Pelicans feed primarily on small fish and
      dive from altitudes of 30 feet or less. The primary threat occurs when the small flocks
      transit the runway approaches and departures in search of food.
      3.3.2. Hazard Reduction: The approaches should be closely monitored for their activity
      and appropriate advisories should be transmitted as required. Positive measures such as
 10                                             MACDILLAFBI91-212 8 NOVEMBER 2011


      the removal of vegetation in the drainage ditches must be employed. Constant surveying
      by aircrews, airfield management, and tower personnel is imperative.
   3.4. Gulls (Charadriiformes laridae).
      3.4.1. Hazard: This species provides the second largest threat to flight operations in the
      airfield area. Several subfamilies are permanent residents of the bay area as well as a
      migratory hazard. Gulls are primarily scavengers and gather at garbage dumps, ducts,
      and other lucrative sources of food. They have a relatively slow wing beat that affects
      their maneuverability and they cannot accurately judge the descent path of an aircraft.
      This combination leads to most bird strikes occurring on takeoffs and landings. In
      addition, their movements from roost, to food source, to loafing areas constitute hazards.
      3.4.2. Hazard Reduction: Habitat modification and control techniques must be devised
      to effectively reduce the threat.
          3.4.2.1. The source of easy food and fresh drinking water near loafing areas within
          the general airfield area must be reduced to an absolute minimum. Sanitary landfill
          operations must be closely monitored as they are a major attractor and food source.
          Every consideration must be given to controlling insects and vegetation both through
          the use of chemicals and a vigorous mowing program. (OPR: 6 CES/CEO)
          3.4.2.2. Once the food source is eliminated, action will be taken daily to reduce the
          attraction of the loafing areas such as clearing ramp space and closely mowing fields.
          Dispersal procedures, such as pyrotechnics and bioacoustics, will be used as
          appropriate. If birds are unresponsive to dispersal techniques, consider the use of
          depredation. These same techniques will be vigorously employed during BWC
          MODERATE and SEVERE. (OPR: 6 AMW/SEFB)
   3.5. Resident Waterfowl (Herons, Egrets, Ibises, Storks, Ducks, and Cormorants).
      3.5.1. Hazard: These species are attracted to the drainage ditches on the airfield. The
      emergent and submerged vegetation provides areas for feeding, nesting, and shelter.
      Their movement from the shore areas to the drainage ditches on the airfield constitutes
      the primary hazard. They have a flight characteristic very similar to gulls. Due to the
      location of their feeding areas, they are primarily found adjacent to the arrival end of
      runway 04, Mole Hole area, and connecting taxiways.
      3.5.2. Hazard Reduction: Removing vegetation and perch areas adjacent to ditches will
      significantly reduce waterfowl numbers. Pyrotechnics are excellent control techniques.
   3.6. Other resident species in the immediate area that are being studied as needed include
   raptors, owls, nighthawks, doves, crows, shorebirds, plovers, pipers, upland species,
   blackbirds, and starlings.
4. Operations.
   4.1. Reporting Procedures. All personnel discovering a bird-aircraft strike will notify Wing
   Safety and Command Post as soon as possible. This is required to ensure that evidence is
   preserved in order to identify the bird species involved. The only identification features that
   should be preserved are blood smears and non-fleshy remains (feathers, feet, or beaks).
   During non-duty hours, maintenance and Airfield Management Operations personnel will
MACDILLAFBI91-212 8 NOVEMBER 2011                                                             11


  make arrangements for the preservation of evidence until Wing Safety assumes responsibility
  for it.
     4.1.1. The aircrew involved will complete an AF Form 853 providing as much
     information as possible concerning the circumstances of the incident. Forms will be
     turned in to Maintenance Debrief or directly turned in to Wing Safety.
     4.1.2. Maintenance Debrief will transmit all AF Forms 853 to 6 AMW/SEF at
     6amw.sef@us.af.mil (preferred method) or FAX at Commercial 813-828-6794, DSN
     968-6794.
     4.1.3. Airfield Management Operations personnel will assist transient aircrews in
     completing AF Forms 853, as applicable.
     4.1.4. Command Post will run appropriate checklists and provide a copy of all bird strike
     related Operational Report 3 (OPREP-3) reports to Wing Safety.
     4.1.5. The Wing Safety Office will maintain a historical database of bird-aircraft strike(s)
     in their area of influence. This information will be compiled and reviewed regularly in
     order to determine the current hazard and appropriate operational risk management
     (ORM) measures.
     4.1.6. The Wing Safety Office will up-channel bird-aircraft strike data in accordance
     with AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
     4.1.7. This operation establishes procedures to be used for the immediate exchange of
     information between ground agencies and aircrews concerning the existence and location
     of birds that could pose a hazard to flight.
  4.2. Bird Watch Condition.           The following terminology will be used for rapid
  communications to disseminate bird activity and implement unit operational procedures.
  Bird locations should be given with condition code (i.e., Condition Severe, runway 04,
  approach end). Note: It is apparent that some subjectivity may be involved in declaring a
  BWC. Further, it cannot be overstressed that the use of numbers (5 to 15 large birds, etc.) is
  intended as a guide and a myriad of factors must be assessed when establishing a BWC. The
  declaring authority will utilize his/her expertise and best judgment to make the decision. If
  doubt exists as to the severity of the hazard, the declaration will be made for the worst case.
     4.2.1. BWC LOW: Normal bird activity on and above the airfield with a low probability
     of hazard. No flight restrictions apply.
     4.2.2. BWC MODERATE: Concentrations of 5 to 10 large birds (waterfowl, raptors,
     gulls, etc.) or 10 to 30 small birds (terns, swallows, etc.) observable on locations that
     represent a probable hazard to safe flying operations. Flight restrictions apply from
     paragraph 4.4.2.
     4.2.3. BWC SEVERE: Heavy concentrations of birds (more than 10 large birds or 30
     small birds) on or above the runway, taxiways, in field areas, or departures or arrival
     routes. Flight restrictions apply from paragraph 4.4.2.
     4.2.4. BIRD WATCH Alert: Weather, time of day, and seasonal conditions are such as
     to expect a hazardous influx of birds onto the airfield. A Bird Watch Alert should be
     issued in lieu of a Bird Watch Condition whenever the certainty of expected/potential
12                                             MACDILLAFBI91-212 8 NOVEMBER 2011


     bird activity is not high enough to warrant altering flight operations. For example,
     conditions such as migratory periods and mowing operations, among others, have
     historically produced hazardous levels of bird activity, especially when experienced in
     combination. When a BWC of MODERATE or SEVERE is declared, there is no longer
     a need to announce a Bird Watch Alert.
  4.3. Authority. The authority to declare a BWC is vested with Airfield Management (6
  OSS/OSAA), the Wildlife Control contractor (6 AMW/SEFB), or Tower (6 OSS/OSAT).
  Aircrews, Safety, Aircraft Maintenance, Security Forces, and Airfield Maintenance personnel
  will inform Airfield Management Operations, 6 OSS/OSAT, or Command Post if significant
  bird activity is observed. When 6 OSS/OSAA, 6 AMW/SEFB, or 6 OSS/OSAT determines
  that bird dispersal is required, Airfield Management or 6 AMW/SEFB will respond
  immediately and will complete all documentation after tasking.
     4.3.1. Downgrading: Once BWC MODERATE has been declared, only 6 OSS/OSAA, 6
     OSS/OSAT, or 6 AMW/SEFB may cancel or downgrade. Upon the declaration of BWC
     SEVERE, downgrade authority is solely vested in 6 OG/CC or 927 OG/CC to condition
     commensurate with latest information.
  4.4. BWC Phase Operating Restrictions.
     4.4.1. Phase Periods.
         4.4.1.1. Phase I Operations. (Typically 1 March-31 October): No restrictions.
         Migratory Periods: Fall (15 October-15 November) and spring (15 March-15 April)
         migration periods will be mitigated by entering BW Alert when migration cycles are
         observed. Bird movement occurs all day long but is likely to increase during the hour
         before and after sunrise and sunset. Changes from the BW Alert to a BWC will be
         declared by 6 OSS/OSAA, 6 OSS/OSAT or 6 AMW/SEFB. The BWC will be
         declared as conditions warrant and will be based on the location, number, and size of
         the birds.
         4.4.1.2. Phase II Operations (Typically 1 November-28 February): During Phase II
         operations, the BASH posture will be BW Alert. Although BW Alert will be in affect
         24 hours a day during Phase II operations, particular attention should be given to the
         hour before and after sunrise and sunset due to bird feeding times and during mid-day
         hours from 0900-1500 due to the soaring bird threat. The declaration of a BWC will
         carry the operational limitations associated with the BWC. Crews will ensure
         vigilance and proper coordination prior to operations in a declared BWC window.
         Note: Phase II Operations is a scheduling requirement. If a mission in execution
         returns during the BASH window, they will make their approach based on the current
         BWC.
     4.4.2. Flight Restrictions. The following flight restrictions for airfield operations will be
     imposed during BWC MODERATE and SEVERE.
         4.4.2.1. MODERATE:         Requires increased vigilance by all agencies and extra
         caution by aircrews.
            4.4.2.1.1. Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed only when departure and
            arrival routes avoid identified bird activity.
MACDILLAFBI91-212 8 NOVEMBER 2011                                                             13


              4.4.2.1.2. Local IFR/VFR traffic pattern activity ceases.
          4.4.2.2. SEVERE: Requires total vigilance by all agencies and extreme caution by
          aircrews.
              4.4.2.2.1. Takeoffs and landings are prohibited without 6 OG/CC (or higher)
              approval.
5. Depredation. Personnel performing depredation must be trained and follow all prescribed
procedures to ensure safe operations. All other methods of dispersal must be exhausted prior to
commencing depredation operations.
   5.1. Location: Depredation operations will be conducted only in designated areas. The area
   of operation is designated as perimeter road to the north (due to the close proximity of a
   roadway, weapons must only be fired towards the airfield in this area at all times, no
   exceptions), to the end of the 04 approach lighting pier to the south. The western boundary is
   the tree line. The eastern boundary is approximately 200 feet east of taxiway "Golf".
   Additionally, the entire wetland area east of "Golf" taxiway, between "Hotel" and "Kilo"
   taxiways, will be included as a designated area.
   5.2. Requirements: Personnel will attend shotgun and bird identification training prior to
   being authorized to perform depredation operations. Weapons safety is paramount and must
   be practiced at all times. Any observed safety violation or depredation of a protected species
   would result in immediate revocation of depredation privileges.
   5.3. Authorization: Only qualified personnel from Airfield Management Operations, 6
   AMW/SEFB, and Wing Safety will be authorized to perform depredation operations on
   MacDill AFB. The names of qualified personnel with current training dates will be tracked
   on a locally developed form at base operations. A copy of this list will be attached to the
   depredation permit for reference.
   5.4. Procedures: The following procedures have been set up to comply with regulatory
   standards and to provide safe operations. By following these procedures, the possibility of a
   mishap or depredation of a protected species will be greatly reduced.
       5.4.1. Prior to beginning depredation operations, the individual must submit a verbal
       request to the following agencies:
          5.4.1.1. AMOPS (Commercial 813-828-2321; DSN 968-2321).
          5.4.1.2. Tower (Commercial 813-828-2120; DSN 968-2120).
          5.4.1.3. Security Forces (Commercial 813-828-3322; DSN 968-3322).
       5.4.2. AMOPS, Tower, and Security Forces will confirm no conflict exists and it is safe
       to conduct depredation operations on the airfield. The individual will again notify the
       above agencies at the completion of depredation operations.
          5.4.2.1. Individuals performing depredation must carry a copy of the weapons and
          depredation permit during operations to comply with federal regulations.
          5.4.2.2. Personnel will wear appropriate eye and ear protection while performing
          depredation operations.
14                                            MACDILLAFBI91-212 8 NOVEMBER 2011


        5.4.2.3. Wildlife species on the United States or Florida State Threatened or
        Endangered List must not be taken for any reason. If you are unsure of the species,
        do not depredate it. If a threatened or endangered species is taken accidentally, report
        it immediately to 6 AMW/SE and 6 CES/CEVN. Do not dispose of the remains until
        instructed to do so.
        5.4.2.4. The use of blinds, pits, or other means of concealment, decoys, calls, or other
        devices used to lure or entice birds is strictly prohibited and will not be utilized.
        5.4.2.5. Taking birds will be by 12 gauge shotgun fired from the shoulder only with
        shot no larger than No. 7 1/2.
        5.4.2.6. Personnel must be in radio contact with Tower at all times while depredation
        operations are in progress. All depredation actions must cease immediately upon any
        aircraft activity within 1000 yards on the ground or upon any aircraft entering final
        approach patterns.
        5.4.2.7. Personnel must be aware of their surroundings at all times. A spotter should
        be used to increase vigilance during operations. Do not shoot directly towards any
        personnel at any time. Additionally, do not shoot towards buildings or airfield
        equipment if it is located within 100 yards of your position or towards aircraft within
        1000 yards.
        5.4.2.8. Personnel will position themselves between the runway and the birds
        whenever possible during depredation to provide the maximum dispersal
        effectiveness.
     5.4.3. Tracking and Disposal: The numbers of birds taken is a critical factor in
     conservation and must be tracked accordingly. State and federal agencies use these
     numbers to determine how many birds were taken in a region and may limit the allowed
     take to prevent over-depredating the species. Proper disposal is an equally important
     issue. Improper disposal has the possibility of spreading disease as well as acting as an
     attractor to other birds or other scavengers.
        5.4.3.1. Tracking will be by species on a locally created form. Information the form
        must contain is 1) the date birds were taken, 2) the species of the birds taken, and 3)
        the number of each species. These forms will be turned in quarterly to Wing Flight
        Safety (6 AMW/SEF). Flight Safety will then compile the total numbers and report
        these to 6 CES/CEVN.
        5.4.3.2. Birds taken must be disposed of by burial. Carcasses must be buried in the
        wooded areas off the airfield and covered by at least 6 inches of dirt when level with
        ground. Use a new burial location each time to minimize any effects at any single
        location. Periodically, review recent burial sites to see if other animals have
        disturbed them. If there is evidence of this, increase the amount of dirt covering the
        carcasses to at least 12 inches on subsequent burials.
MACDILLAFBI91-212 8 NOVEMBER 2011                                                      15


6. Non-MacDill AFB Located Units. Non-MacDill located units will notify Tower of any bird
strikes that occur in the MacDill AFB traffic pattern. Their respective Safety office will
coordinate with the 6 AMW/SEF or 6 AMW/SEFB for coordination of remains collection and
investigation as necessary.

                                 BASH INSPECTION AREAS

A2.1. Area A: This is the most critical area for aircraft operations and is defined as the runway
area from the clear zone (CZ) of Runway 04 through the CZ of Runway 22, to include the area
1500 feet to the left and right of the runway. The 1500-foot area on the tower side of the runway
extends to the tree line.
A2.2. Area B: This area is defined as the remainder of the airfield and includes all taxiways,
parking apron, refueling pits, infield areas, departure and arrival routes, and all remaining areas
on the airfield. Active bird removal from these areas is paramount when bird activity is low in
Area A.
A2.3. Area C: This area includes all hangars and buildings on the airfield perimeter. BASH
personnel will work in cooperation with the building owning agencies to help prevent a continual
bird presence in and around these areas. Note: For large numbers of birds, BASH activities will
be prioritized based on area. It is important to emphasize that, although birds may have moved
away from a critical area (Area A) into a less critical area (B or C), continued vigilance is
required. Birds can quickly nest in certain areas, so continual harassment is needed.
