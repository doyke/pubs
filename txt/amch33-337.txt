MODERN STAFFING
CONSIDERATIONS 
     Intent
     The traditional staff structure as used by the DoD is a powerful archi-
     tecture with centuries of proven performance. The concepts in this
     document will augment this architecture with Web 2.0 capabilities for
     increasing the speed, accuracy, and relevance of knowledge for AMC
     and MAF decision makers' benefit.                                                              The pyramid above represents the formal staff hierarchy. AMC
                                                                                                    uses Task Management Tool (TMT) to track tasker flow through

     The power of Web 2.0 tools depends upon the effective combination
     of formal and informal collaboration. Trust is required to foster in-
     formality, which leads to the most open dialogue and deepest contri-
     bution of content by participants.                                                           AMC members should only need to look in one place to find offi-

     Destructive criticism and censure, regardless of the source, whether

YOUR
     DIGITAL OFFICE:
     A New Perspective
      The Web 2.0 collaboration tools are just a fraction of your digital of-
      fice. There are a variety of tools that you use on a daily basis that you
      may not be using to their full advantage or using out of habit.
      Now that you’re aware of some of the collaboration tools available to
      you, take another look at e-mail and other Office Suite tools. Perhaps
      there are new ways to use them with Web 2.0.




           E-mail
      Though e-mail is the most familiar tool in the AMC staffer’s tool box
      there are more effective ways to collaborate.

      E-mail Saves Time & Energy

       It’s the standard and everyone has access to it: We don’t always
         do business with just DoD
       It’s integrated with Microsoft products: The 2013 edition of Mi-
         crosoft Office Suite is even more integrated than before

      Not Recommended For

       Large attachments: Upload the file to an EIM/SharePoint website
         and share a link to the uploaded file's website via e-mail. Large
         attachments clog inboxes
       Group collaboration: Attachments and reply all e-mail chains can
         hinder communication. Inbox limits can prevent files from being
         sent and received and trap information from excluded parties
       Redundant files cost the sender time and energy as well: In addi-
         tion to the unnecessary consumption of valuable data storage
         space on personal computers and network servers, version control

      will involve several large meetings with over 30 people, typically lasting an
      hour. Capturing the notes will be difficult even with the help of others.
      Questions will later arise over the intent of a comment and who made it.                                TMT

      Reconciling notes will be so much easier and effective. Instead of requir-
