                                  PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview. This instruction provides guidance, responsibilities, and procedures for
execution of the AME. The AME provides direct support to Air Force operations by promoting
and sustaining force health, preventing injury and illness, restoring health, and sustaining human
performance. These key mission areas are accomplished at the unit level through effective
management of seven major Aerospace Medicine programs. These are:
   1.1.1. Flight and Operational Medicine Program.
   1.1.2. Occupational and Environmental Health Program.
   1.1.3. Force Health Protection and Medical Readiness Program.
   1.1.4. Community Health Program.
   1.1.5. Human Performance Sustainment Program.
   1.1.6. Emergency Response/Disaster Management Program.
   1.1.7. Health Promotion.
1.2. AME Unit-Level Management.
   1.2.1. Management of the Aerospace Medicine programs to achieve objectives and desired
   effects will follow established principles of program management:
       1.2.1.1. Establish clear objectives and goals.
       1.2.1.2. Define tasks and responsibilities necessary to achieve objectives.
       1.2.1.3. Specify clear and reasonable timelines.
       1.2.1.4. Ensure accountability.
       1.2.1.5. Measure effectiveness of reaching the objectives and desired effects.
       1.2.1.6. Redirect local plans, guidance, and practices as needed to better achieve desired
       effects.
1.3. AME Scope.
   1.3.1. The AME is comprised of personnel (Team Aerospace (TA)) and activities that
   include, but are not limited to: Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), Aerospace & Operational
   Physiology (AOP), En Route Patient Staging, Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE), Flight
   and Operational Medicine (FOM), Occupational Medicine (OM), Optometry, Public Health
   (PH), Personnel Reliability Program (PRP), and Health Promotion as well as education,
   research and development activities related to these programs. TA personnel work
   collaboratively for the success of the seven Aerospace Medicine programs. Medical
   treatment facilities’ (MTF) AMEs are represented to the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS)
   corporate structure for the purposes of planning and programming by the Aerospace
   Operations (AO) panel.

     1.3.2. The AME is implemented at locations wherever there is an AF mission. Locations
     include Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve
     (AFR) installations, Geographically Separated Units (GSU), sites with a Limited Scope
     Medical Treatment Facility (LSMTF), sites with a medical aid station (MAS), sites with a
     Medical Squadron, sites with no assigned medical personnel, and deployed locations.
     1.3.3. Sites with a MTF will implement the appropriate scope of the AME with assigned
     personnel as the base operational mission demands. Defining the scope of the AME and
     missions covered will be the responsibility of the base Chief of Aerospace Medicine (SGP),
     Squadron and Medical Group (MDG) commanders in consultation with the base line
     command and Major Command (MAJCOM)/SGP.
     1.3.4. GSUs, sites with a Medical Squadron, LSMTF, MAS, or no assigned medical
     personnel will implement the AME with the assistance of a supporting MTF designated by
     the unit’s owning MAJCOM/SG. The overall responsibility for the execution of the AME at
     supported sites will reside with the supporting MTF Commander (MTF/CC). If the nearest
     MTF is from another MAJCOM, the supported site will arrange through Memorandum of
     Understanding (MOU) or Support Agreement (SA) with that MTF after consultation with the
     supporting and supported MAJCOM/SGPs for the appropriate support.
     1.3.5. Deployed sites will implement all Aerospace Medicine programs tailored to support
     the operational mission. As these sites mature, phasing in of more robust AME is indicated
     as directed by the Combatant Command (COCOM) or Air Force Forces (AFFOR)/Surgeon
     General (SG) or SGP. The timeline for phasing in will be developed by the local SGP after
     coordination with the appropriate COCOM, AFFOR or MAJCOM/SG or SGP.
     1.3.6. ANG or AFRC medical units will implement the AME either utilizing organic
     capabilities or they will ensure the quality of the AME through an actively enforced host-
     tenant support agreement (HTSA). The overall responsibility for ensuring the execution of
     the AME will reside with the ANG or AFRC medical unit, even though AME services may
     be provided through HTSA or contract.
        1.3.6.1. AD units will be responsible for services and program support agreed to in a
        HTSA.
     1.3.7. AF units in a supported relationship on a joint base will implement the appropriate
     scope of the AME through organic capabilities or they will ensure the quality of the AME
     through agreement with the host base.
1.4. Specific Organizational Responsibilities.
     1.4.1. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve
     Affairs (SAF/MR) serves as an agent of the Secretary and provides guidance, direction, and

                   HUMAN PERFORMANCE SUSTAINMENT PROGRAM

6.1. Definitions of Human Performance Terms.
   6.1.1. Personnel are the most important and valuable resource for the AF. The Airman is a
   “human weapon system” requiring “total life-cycle support and maintenance.” This line of
   reasoning leads to three interrelated human performance areas.
       6.1.1.1. Human       Performance      Sustainment      covers     accession     through
       separation/retirement with the goal of maintaining target performance levels throughout
       an Airman’s career while minimizing adverse health effects. Preventive medicine is a
       major contributor to performance sustainment because physical and mental health are
       necessary precursors to performance.          Accordingly, performance sustainment
       encompasses health service support functions.
       6.1.1.2. Human Performance Optimization seeks to achieve the most efficient use of
       limited human resources by comprehensively integrating Airmen with organizational and
       technical systems. It goes well beyond human-machine interface design and involves
       deliberate planning to efficiently leverage Airmen through the process of HSI. This area
       aligns both line and medical resources and objectives.
       6.1.1.3. Human Performance Enhancement enables Airmen to operate beyond currently
       achievable and sustainable performance thresholds. It is chiefly accomplished through
       science and technology initiatives that range across the spectrum from intra-human (e.g.,
       biotechnology and pharmacology) to extra-human (e.g., hardware and software).
6.2. Objectives.
   6.2.1. The purpose of the Human Performance Sustainment Program is to sustain the
   performance of Airmen, whether in the face of enemy conflict, environmental threats and
   stressors, or advancing age. AME personnel provide feedback and lessons learned on human
   performance shortfalls and/or emerging threats to those organizations and agencies
   responsible for Human Performance Optimization and Enhancement.
   6.2.2. Physical, mental and emotional health as well as physical fitness are necessary
   precursors to human performance. As such, any activity that supports or encourages
   improvement in health or fitness contributes to sustaining baseline human performance.
   Therefore, the other six AME programs described in this Instruction each contribute to
   human performance sustainment and their indicators can be classified as human performance
   sustainment indicators. This program, while looking at all AME programs and indicators,
   will also focus base-wide on the threats that are specific to subordinate units and/or locations.
   The AMC will consult with operational line leadership and develop a prioritized list of local
   human performance sustainment threats. The AMC/line leadership team will develop
   interventions and indicators to measure implementation effectiveness. Examples of human
   performance sustainment threats are: fatigue, degraded visual acuity, inappropriate shift
   work cycles, weather extremes (cold and heat), spatial disorientation, hazardous noise, G-
   induced loss of consciousness (GLOC), inadequate manpower for task, air sickness,
   vibration, inadequate diet, use of nutritional supplements and hydration, hypoxia, etc. (T-2)

   6.4.2. Airmen available for and capable of deployment and/or employment to successfully
   accomplish assigned missions with minimized assumed risk.
   6.4.3. Operational commanders’ decision-making and risk management processes are
   informed by consideration of mission-specific human performance capabilities, limitations,
   and requirements and associated full spectrum threats.
   6.4.4. Threats to human performance are proactively mitigated (i.e., primary prevention),
   negative human performance trends are quickly identified and corrected (i.e., secondary
   prevention), and processes to minimize the impact of the adverse effects of human
   performance failures are in place (i.e., tertiary prevention).
   6.4.5. Organizations and agencies responsible for Human Performance Optimization are
   aware of human performance shortfalls or emerging full spectrum threats.
   6.4.6. Organizations and agencies responsible for Human Performance Enhancement are
   aware of the need for potential new human performance capabilities (i.e., capabilities that
   cannot be achieved with or derived from current programs and/or systems).
6.5. Indicators.
   6.5.1. An AMC validated prioritized list of local human performance sustainment threats
   developed. (T-1)
