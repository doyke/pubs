     program and ensuring that all organizations and volunteers are adhering to uniform standards
     of professionalism.
3. Eligibility. Opportunity to participate in the Volunteer Program is available to all active duty
military, federal civilians, military and federal retirees, and family members that possess a valid
Department of Defense Identification Card regardless of their agency affiliation.

     longer available.
     4.4. Volunteer incentives will be made available based on the resources that are available.
     4.5. Incentives earned are non-transferable and can only be used by the volunteer who
     qualified for the incentive.

   4.7. Family VIP. Families can enroll in this program if they want to collectively accrue 12,

   by the all participating family members.

            award.
        5.1.8. Volunteer of the Month: Each agency with five or more volunteers is encouraged
        to have an internal Volunteer of the Month recognition program.

6. VIP Program Mechanics.

     6.2. A list of volunteers and the number of hours they have donated will be compiled by
     each agency Volunteer Coordinator and turned in no later than the 5th duty day of each
     month. If hours are not turned in on time, the volunteer could lose that month’s incentives.
     The agency Volunteer Coordinator is responsible for certifying the hours.
     6.3. The number of hours volunteered will be tabulated from the first day to the last day of
     each month. Volunteer incentives will be effective from the 16th of the month to the 15th of
     the following month. For example, the hours volunteered 1–31 May qualify for incentives
     effective 16 June–15 July.
     6.4. MacVIP cards will be issued to each eligible volunteer. The cards will show an
     expiration date, the level of incentive, and an explanation of incentives on the reverse side of
     the card.
     6.5. The A&FRC will provide each agency the appropriate number of cards for issue to
     eligible volunteers. Volunteer agencies can pick up their agency’s cards no earlier than the
     15th of each month. The agency representative will sign for the packages upon receipt.
