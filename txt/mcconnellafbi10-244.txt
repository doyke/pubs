1. Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) Unit Type Code (UTC) AEF Reporting Tool
(ART) Reporting. Unit commander assessments reported in ART present the status of each
UTC in the UTC Availability Module (UTA) library. Provide higher levels of command the
necessary information to make force and resource allocation decisions to effectively support
theater commanders. Within the AEF construct, UTC assessments are used to determine the
most effective force tasking. Effective management of Air Force resources requires accurate
information at all levels. For these reasons integrity in reporting an accurate status is paramount.
ART is not a report card, but a method of identifying a UTC’s ability to perform its Mission
Capability (MISCAP) and identify shortages of resources. Therefore, commanders must “tell it
like it is”.
2. Written Guidance. Each ART reporting unit must have a soft copy of AFI 10-
244_AMCSUP1 Reporting Status of Aerospace Expeditionary Forces to AFI 10-244, AFI 10-
400 AEF Planning and Operations, and McConnell Air Force Base Instruction (MAFBI) 10-244.
3. ART Reporting Process Responsibilities:
     3.1. Wing ART Manager:
        3.1.1. Will conduct and document ART training for all primary and alternate designated
        unit approvers (managers).
        3.1.2. Will collect and compile each unit’s report into an approved format for wing
        commander and key staff review at the wing monthly SORTS/ART Briefing.
        3.1.3. Will review ART Point of Contact (POC) listings quarterly for accuracy and for
        personnel that have departed station.
        3.1.4. Will conduct an annual staff assistance visit to all units responsible for ART
        reporting.
        3.1.5. Will monitor database daily for overdue UTCs and immediately notify unit
        managers.
        3.1.6. Will report ART status to WG/CC in conjunction with monthly Status of Training
        and Resources System (SORTS) briefing.
     3.2. Unit commanders:
        3.2.1. Will designate at least two ART managers in writing and provide wing ART
        administrator a copy for file. Units must maintain the ability to deploy one trained
        manager and allow for peacetime leave and temporay duty assignment (TDY) without
        disrupting normal reporting requirements. (Attachment 1)
        3.2.2. Must ensure ART managers have the proper security clearance to access AEF
        materials. This will be verified by the Unit Security Manager on each unit’s appointment
        letter.
        3.2.3. Must be aware of current and projected resources status in order to provide
        accurate get well date (GWD) projections when submitting assessments.
        3.2.4. Must receive training from the Wing ART Manager within 10 duty days of taking
        command.
     3.3. Unit Monitors/Approvers:
MCCONNELLAFBI10-244 22 OCTOBER 2013                                                             3


       3.3.1. Primary and alternate unit ART managers must receive training from the Wing
       ART Administrator within 10 duty days of appointment.
       3.3.2. If discrepancies are noted between other deployment tasking databases and the
       UTA time phased force development data (TPFDD) loaded in ART, it is incumbent on
       the unit to research the disconnect and work to resolve the issue with their respective
       Major Command (MAJCOM) Functional Area Managers.
       3.3.3. Ensure continuity is maintained in the unit ART program. Maintain a separate
       continuity binder to include the following MANDATORY sections:
TAB 1:
- Wing ART Administrator Appointment Letter
- Unit ART Manager Appointment Letter
- Unit Appointment Letter for Authorization to sign ART reports in absence of the commander

TAB 2:

4. Unit Reporting Requirements/ Procedures:
   4.1. All units reporting AEF status must use the ART On-line. The Air Force goal for on-
   time reporting is 97% with AMC setting its goal at 98%. McConnell AFB goal for on-time
 4                                             MCCONNELLAFBI10-244 22 OCTOBER 2013


     reporting is no less than 100% at all times. Any failure to maintain this will require
     justification to be provided to and through the group commander to the wing commander.
     4.2. For updated information used in compiling your monthly assessments, such as the TPFDD,
     Manpower and Equipment Force Packing System (MEFPAK) regulations, Manpower Force
     Packing System (MANFOR) and Functional Area Manager listing, please refer to the AMC
     website, https://afkm.wrightpatterson.smil.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter-382 and
     for further information on Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEF), refer to the AEF center
     website, https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil.
     4.3. Units are required to update and submit the approval of commander’s UTC assessment
     (readiness and tasking) between the 10th and 15th of each month. Commander’s Approval
     Reports (Readiness and Tasking) are only required to be submitted to the Wing ART
     Administrator in hard copy once a month, no later than close of business (COB) on the 15th.
     4.4. Upon notification of a significant event that changes the assessment of a UTC, the unit
     will submit an out-of-cycle assessment report within 24 hours of the change. This includes
     notification of a UTC add, change, or deletion. 22 LRS/LGRDX will make every attempt to
     keep the unit informed but this will be a courtesy notification and does not relieve the unit
     ART manager of their responsibility to review ART daily.
     4.5. Units with UTCs tasked to deploy will submit via ART an assessment of their ability to
     support the tasking, including theater-specific requirements, within five (5) days of receipt of
     a deployment notification.
     4.6. Units with a UTC returning from deployment will reset the deployment status from
     "Yes" to "No" not later than five (5) calendar days after the tasked resources return to home
     station.
     4.7. Units will ensure data and remarks adequately and accurately reflect the UTC’s
     capability.
     4.8. Units will utilize the worksheets to provide an accurate assessment.
5. Commander’s Approval Report:
     5.1. Unit: Unit Reporting on UTC/AEF
     5.2. AEF: AEF # or Enabler. (Enabler: A UTC not assigned to an AEF but can be tasked at
     any time.)
     5.3. Unit Type Code/Unit Line Number (UTC/ULN)
     5.4. GWD: Get Well Date (Date expected status to be back to green)
     5.5. UTC Status:
5.5.1. Green = Go: MEFPAK (MANFOR, Logistics Force Packing System (LOGFOR))
Identified personnel and equipment for the AEF allocated UTC are available for deployment
within 72 hours of notification or sooner if subject to more stringent criteria.

        5.5.2. Yellow = Caution: The UTC has a missing or deficient capability; but that
        missing or deficient capability does not prevent the UTC from being tasked and
        accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF Rotation. Mandatory: Provide a
MCCONNELLAFBI10-244 22 OCTOBER 2013                                                           5


      detailed explanation of the shortfall in remarks. Describe the shortfall, the corrective
      action and provide a Get Well Date.
      5.5.3. Red = No Go: The UTC has a missing or deficient capability that prevents the
      UTC from being tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF
      Rotation. Mandatory: Provide a detailed explanation of the shortfall in remarks.
      Describe the shortfall, the corrective action and provide a Get Well Date.
   5.6. Resource Area: Commanders rate each UTC against the unit’s current ability to deploy
   and employ the UTC. Areas to be assessed are personnel, equipment, training, and
   equipment condition. Personnel must be worldwide mobility qualified and have all required
   mission and skill level training complete IAW applicable directives and instructions.
   Equipment must be serviceable and available for deployment. For reporting purposes
   personnel substitutions reflected in the UTC MISCAP are authorized unless precluded in the
   deployment planning guidance.
   5.7. Tasked to Deploy/Can meet Theater specific Required/Line Remarks: Each unit will
   indicate if a UTC is tasked to deploy, the remaining question is whether it can meet theater
   specific requirements including line remarks IAW timing criteria. Remarks are mandatory if
   UTC cannot meet theater specific requirements. If a portion of a UTC is tasked to deploy,
   the remaining assets continue to be postured for the entire deployment eligibility window.
   Commanders will continue to submit an overall UTC assessment that treats the deployed
   portion of that UTC as available and healthy unless circumstances/information warrant
   otherwise. Units owning a UTC tasked to deploy will reset the deployment status from
   “Yes” to “No” not later than five (5) days after the tasked resource returns to home station.
   5.8. Remarks: Each unit will submit remarks IAW AFI 10-244, Chapter 3.
6. AEF Tempo Bands:
   6.1. Based on Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) approval and direction, functional area
   placement in one of five Temp Bands is based on the deploy-to-dwell ratio corresponding to
   levels of risk to a functional area’s effort to effectively train and sustain forces.
      6.1.1. Tempo Band A = Four months deployed every 20 months. Deployment dwell
      ratio is 1:6.
      6.1.2. Tempo Band B = Six months deployed followed by two years at home.
      Deployment dwell ratio is 1:4.
      6.1.3. Tempo Band C = Six months deployed followed by 18 months home.
      Deployment dwell ratio is 1:3.
      6.1.4. Tempo Band D = Six months deployed and one year home. Deployment dwell
      ratio is 1:2.
      6.1.5. Tempo Band E = Six months deployed and six months home. Deployment dwell
      ratio is 1:1.
