                                              Chapter 1

                                    PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

1.1. Program Description. The USAF Military Personnel Exchange Program (MPEP) is an
instrument by which the USAF builds, sustains, and expands international relationships that are
critical enablers for our Expeditionary Air and Space Force. MPEP allows the USAF to
exchange personnel in substantially equivalent grades and specialties with foreign nations,
enhancing our ability to perform coalition operations with global partners. To maximize the
overall effectiveness of MPEP as an engagement tool, exchanges must support the strategic
guidance, goals, and criteria set forth by the Department of Defense (DoD), HQ USAF, and
regional Combatant Commanders.
1.2. Strategic Guidance. The DoD, HQ USAF, and Combatant Commanders have outlined
goals and objectives for building long lasting relationships with our global partners. Knowledge
of the following is essential in order to employ MPEP as an effective engagement tool.
     1.2.1. The Secretary of Defense Security Cooperation Guidance.
     1.2.2. The United States Air Force Security Cooperation Strategy.
     1.2.3. The Combatant Command Theater Security Cooperation Strategies.
1.3. Goals. The Air Force MPEP is intended to:
     1.3.1. Promote mutual understanding and trust.
     1.3.2. Enhance interoperability through mutual understanding of doctrine, tactics,
     techniques, and procedures of both air forces.
     1.3.3. Strengthen air force-to-air force ties.
     1.3.4. Develop long-term professional and personal relationships.
1.4. Criteria. The MPEP must meet the following criteria:
     1.4.1. Exchanges must provide political and military advantages to both air forces.
     1.4.2. Foreign exchange personnel must serve a practical utility, considering national
     security interests, operational requirements, and disclosure limitations.
     1.4.3. Exchanges must support and not contradict other military arrangements with the
     applicable country.
     1.4.4. Exchanges must be fiscally affordable for both air forces and within their manpower
     capabilities.
     1.4.5. Exchanges must be reciprocal, particularly the ability of the U.S. Air Force to assign
     exchange personnel within the foreign air force in a substantially equivalent capacity.
     Requests for assignment of exchange personnel on a non-reciprocal basis shall be forwarded
     to the International Security Programs Directorate, Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of
     Defense (Technology Security Policy) for approval.

                                           Chapter 3

                                PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

3.1. Program Foundation. Military Personnel Exchange Programs between the USAF and the
air forces of a foreign nation are established under a formal international agreement. The
agreement sets general conditions for the exchange program and, among other things, provides
for the establishment, modification, and cancellation of individual exchange positions within the
exchange program.
   3.1.1. DUSD(ISP) conducts Department of State consultation under Case Act (1 USC
   112b(c)) in accordance with DoD Directive 5530.3, International Agreements, June 11, 1987,
   with Change 1.
   3.1.2. USAF negotiations for exchange agreements will comply with DoDD 5230.20, its
   implementing instruction, and DoDD 5530.3, with Change 1. SAF/IAPA drafts all USAF
   MPEP agreements and coordinates them with the CONUS and Regional Program
   Management Offices, affected MAJCOMs, AF/XO, AF/DP, AF/SG, SAF/GCI, SAF/IA
   Country Directors, SAF/XC, DUSD(ISP), and the National Guard Bureau as applicable.
3.2. General Requirements. The MPEP operates with a one-for-one reciprocal exchange of
US and foreign personnel. Each exchange places substantially equivalent, qualified personnel
into similar positions so both services benefit. Foreign exchange personnel fill existing USAF
Unit Manpower Document (UMD) positions. Since the MPEP utilizes existing positions on
USAF Unit Manpower Documents, the MPEP does not increase Air Force end strength.
3.3. New Exchange Programs. The SECAF has re-delegated authority to develop, oversee,
and execute international programs and activities affiliated with the Department of the Air Force
to SAF/IA. As part of these general responsibilities, SAF/IA has direct responsibility for the
MPEP.
   3.3.1. Requests for New Exchange Program. USAF units requesting the establishment of
   a new exchange program and or positions must submit their proposal to the appropriate
   CONUS Program Management Office. The CONUS Program Management Office will
   forward the proposal to SAF/IAPA for coordination and final approval or disapproval. Any
   foreign unit requesting a new exchange program must submit their proposal through their Air
   Chief. The Air Chief either sends the request to the CSAF, or submits it to SAF/IAPA,
   through their air attaché in Washington, DC, for coordination and final approval or
   disapproval. Include the following documents and information with the proposal:
   3.3.1. (EGLINAFB) Submit requests for new exchange officer positions through the Eglin
   MPEP manager.
       3.3.1.1. Position Description and Requisition Report (PDRR). PDRRs outline the
       position’s essential elements. They must fully and clearly describe the duties,
       qualifications, minimum number and type of accrued flight hours, mandatory
       certifications, training course requirements, required grade, security clearance, and
       experiences needed by the candidate in full detail, so the USAF and foreign air force can
       identify the best-qualified candidate for the exchange position, and schedule required
       training. PDRRs not submitted as outlined in Attachment 2 will be returned.
12                                  AFI16-107_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 SEPTEMBER 2013


     3.3.1.2. Justification for the Exchange. The justification must describe in detail why
     the exchange is being requested. It should include, but is not limited to, the political-
     military benefits the exchange will bring to both air forces, how the exchange will
     enhance the air force-to-air force relationship, and the desired duration of the exchange.
     3.3.1.3. Suggested Reciprocal Position. Regardless of who requests establishment of
     the exchange, a suggested reciprocal position is required. For example, Country X wants
     to enter into an exchange of F-16 pilots but does not maintain F-16s in their inventory.
     Country X would suggest a similar airframe with similar capabilities.
     3.3.1.4. Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letter (DDL): New or modified exchange
     position packages must include a DDL. Governed by AFI 16-201, Air Force Foreign
     Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program, the DDL identifies information,
     information systems, and networks to which the exchange officer requires access in order
     to perform the duties outlined in the PDRR. The DDL is submitted at the time of the
     proposal. Failure to submit a DDL could result in significant delays in approving the
     proposal. The host unit, in coordination with the applicable MAJCOM Foreign
     Disclosure Office (FDO), will develop the DDL. The MAJCOM FDO will forward the
     DDL to SAF/IAPA and SAF/IAPD via appropriate communication channels to determine
     feasibility of disclosure. The foreign air force is not required to provide a DDL.
     3.3.1.5. Security Plan (SP). New or modified exchange position packages must include
     a Security Plan (reference Attachment 8 for a recommended format). The SP provides
     written documentation that appropriate access to USAF communication and computer
     systems, information systems, networks, enclaves, and work areas, as outlined in the
     proposed PDRR and DDL, have been approved by the USAF supervisor, the local
     Information Assurance Office, the Foreign Disclosure Office, and the CONUS Program
     Management Office, and that all applicable requirements listed in AFI 16-201 and AFI
     33-202, Volume 1, Network and Computer Security have been met before the proposal is
     forwarded to the appropriate approval authority. In short, the SP identifies how the
     exchange personnel will gain access to work areas and information listed in the DDL.
     The foreign air force is not required to submit an SP. The SP will:
        3.3.1.5.1. Identify the exchange position number, Unit Manpower Document (UMD)
        position number, and organization of assignment.
        3.3.1.5.2. Identify the physical location of the individual’s work area and any other
        local organizations the exchange officer will be required to visit during their tour.
        3.3.1.5.3. Identify the name, organizational address, and telephone number of the
        USAF supervising official.
        3.3.1.5.4. Identify computers, communication systems, and other equipment the
        exchange officer is authorized to use along with any applicable conditions, user
        licensing requirements, restrictions, and or safeguards.
        3.3.1.5.5. Identify physical access requirements (e.g., escorted or unescorted access
        to the work area or any other areas, badge requirements, etc.)
AFI16-107_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                      13


          3.3.1.5.6. State that the exchange personnel will be instructed to identify himself as a
          member of his parent service in all written, electronic and telephonic communications
          as referenced in AFI 33-202, Volume 1 and AFI 33-119, Air Force Messaging.
          3.3.1.5.7. List the actions US personnel will be responsible for taking to ensure that
          classified and controlled unclassified military information in their work areas or
          common work areas will be controlled during the exchange tour.
          3.3.1.5.8. Identify how visitors will be informed about the existence of the exchange
          personnel and the applicable disclosure and security requirements.
          3.3.1.5.9. If applicable, state that contract employees tasked to provide training for
          exchange personnel have an approved and documented Technical Assistance
          Agreement (TAA).
          3.3.1.5.10. Identify the points of contact and applicable actions to be taken should
          security plan violations occur.
       3.3.1.6. Site Surveys. Site surveys are essential to determining whether to approve the
       establishment of a position within the exchange program. They are required prior to
       approving new positions and should include unit sponsor information; identify whether
       the exchange officer will be subject to unit deployment; describe availability of housing,
       dependent schools, and medical facilities; outline force protection issues; and identify
       driver license and vehicle registration requirements (reference Attachment 9). If a site
       survey was previously accomplished at that location, a new site survey is not required,
       but the information must be validated. This information should be listed in the Notes
       History section of the PDRR.
          3.3.1.6.1. Site Surveys for Exchange Positions Hosted by USAF Units. The
          USAF host unit conducts site surveys in concert with the MAJCOM. Site Surveys
          must ensure security access (OPSEC, COMSEC, physical, etc.) is finalized and meets
          the requirements established in the PDRR and DDL.
          3.3.1.6.2. Site Surveys for Exchange Positions Hosted by Foreign Units. The
          Regional Program Management Office will conduct a site survey and may request
          assistance from the local Air Force Office of Special Investigations Detachment or
          the U.S. Embassy’s Regional Security Officer.
3.4. Revalidating, Submitting Requisitions, and Selecting Personnel for Exchange Positions
Hosted by Foreign Air Force Units. SAF/IAPA will transmit a revalidation requirement
notification to the Regional Program Management Office based on the cumulative duration of a
position's language and pre-employment training as it relates to the USAF assignment cycle
timeline.
   3.4.1. Revalidation. Prior to requesting a replacement, the Regional Program Management
   Office will contact the foreign air force to revalidate the PDRR (reference paragraph 3.3.1.1
   for requirements). Revalidation is required for all positions even if there are no changes to
   the current PDRR. Because many nominees have not undergone language training prior to
   selection, they will be required to take the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB).
   Therefore, the PDRR must include the position’s required DLAB and Defense Language
   Proficiency Test (DLPT) scores. (Reference Attachment 11.) If the position includes flying
 14                                   AFI16-107_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 SEPTEMBER 2013


   duties, the Regional Program Management Office will request assistance from the servicing
   MAJCOM to assess flight safety. Revalidation will be documented with all appropriate
   signatures on the PDRR and submitted to SAF/IAPA for approval as outlined in Attachment
   2.
   3.4.2. Requisitions. Upon approval of the PDRR and in compliance with the AFPC
   assignment cycle timeline, the regional program management office will submit the PDRR to
   AFPC/DPASF (Officer) or AFPC/DPAAS4 (Enlisted), and courtesy copy SAF/IAPA.
   3.4.3. Selecting USAF Exchange Personnel. US Air Force personnel selected for
   exchange duty must be able to successfully carry out their professional responsibilities and
   manage their personal affairs in a highly visible and potentially stressful environment. Based
   on the requirements listed in the PDRR, AFPC will forward nominations to the Regional
   Program Management Office, with courtesy copy to SAF/IAPA. The Regional Program
   Management Office will review the nomination package and forward to the host unit for
   approval. The Regional Program Management Office will notify SAF/IAPA and AFPC or
   ANG/DP in writing of approval or disapproval, to include the name and position of the host-
   country approving authority. If approved AFPC will load the assignment attaching USAF
   exchange personnel to the host unit and the member’s servicing Military Personnel Flight
   will publish Permanent Change of Station orders. If the nomination is disapproved, the host
   unit will provide specific rationale and justification for the disapproval, and AFPC will
   forward a more qualified nomination.
3.5. Revalidating, Submitting Requisitions, and Selecting Personnel for Exchange Positions
Hosted by USAF Units. SAF/IAPA will transmit a revalidation requirement notification based
on the cumulative duration of a position's language and pre-employment training as it relates to
the USAF assignment cycle timeline.
   3.5.1. Revalidation. CONUS Program Management Offices will request USAF host units
   revalidate existing foreign exchange positions by updating the PDRR before personnel are
   replaced (reference paragraph 3.3.1.1 for requirements). Revalidation is required for all
   positions even if there are no changes to the current PDRR. Revalidation will be documented
   with all appropriate signatures on the PDRR (see Attachment 2). The MAJCOM or Agency
   FDO, in coordination with the CONUS Program Management Office, will update the DDL
   (if required) and forward it along with the revalidated PDRR and SP to SAF/IAPA and
   SAF/IAPD via appropriate communication channels for review and approval. SAF/IAPD,
   SAF/IAPA, and HQ USAF organizations with an interest in the position review the
   documentation to ensure the position is current, and disclosure policy is consistent with the
   duties as described in the PDRR. SAF/IAPA will send approved documentation to the
   CONUS Program Management Office who will forward the documentation to the host unit
   commander/supervisor.
   3.5.2. Requisitions. Upon approval, SAF/IAPA will forward the revalidated PDRR to the
   parent service and notify them of replacement requirements.
   3.5.3. Selecting Foreign Exchange Personnel. Based on the requirements listed in the
   PDRR, the parent air force will forward nominations to SAF/IAPA, through their air attaché
   in Washington, DC. Nominations should include a career brief/Curriculum Vitae (CV) that
   outlines the officer's name, rank, service history, English language capabilities, level of
   security clearance, date the security clearance was granted, and date the security clearance
AFI16-107_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                     15


   will expire. For flying positions, the nomination package should also include the individual’s
   flying hours, altitude chamber and centrifuge certifications, and other special qualifications
   as applicable. SAF/IAPA will review and forward replacement nomination packages to the
   applicable CONUS Program Management Office. The CONUS Program Management
   Office will review the nomination package and forward to the host unit for approval. The
   CONUS Program Management Office will notify SAF/IAPA in writing of approval or
   disapproval. If approved, SAF/IAPA will request that AFPC publish orders attaching foreign
   exchange personnel to the host unit. Should the nomination be disapproved, the unit will
   provide specific rationale and justification for the disapproval.
   3.5.4. Assigning Foreign Exchange Personnel. When the nomination package is approved,
   the parent government will submit an Extended Visit Authorization Request and security
   assurances through the parent government’s embassy in Washington, D.C. in accordance
   with DoDD 5230.20. Upon SAF/IAPA request, AFPC/DPASF will publish special orders.
   These orders will identify the exchange officer by name; their service number (if applicable);
   parent service; exchange post number and location; dates of assignment; dates and details of
   pre-employment training (if applicable and available); security clearance information, to
   include date granted and date of expiry; and privileges granted. AFPC/DPASF will forward
   copies to the applicable CONUS Program Management Office, SAF/IAPA, parent
   government embassy, unit of assignment, and individual concerned. These orders, in
   conjunction with the Extended Visit Authorization Request, authenticate exchange personnel
   security clearances and are the sole authority for travel of foreign exchange personnel to the
   United States for the purpose of the exchange assignment. Foreign exchange personnel will
   not initiate travel prior to receipt of these orders. (This does not apply to non-MPEP travel
   such as International Military Education and Training, Professional Military Education
   exchanges, or other travel conducted under Invitational Travel Orders or the Extended Visit
   System.)
3.6. Familiarization, Qualification, and Other Pre-employment Training. Exchange
officers must possess the grade, skill, training, and academic qualifications described in the
applicable PDRR. The parent service will schedule and conduct training needed by the exchange
officer to meet the listed mandatory qualifications. The host service will schedule and conduct
familiarization, orientation, and other pre-employment training listed in the PDRR as required
training.
   3.6.1. When assigning USAF personnel to exchange positions, the applicable branch within
   the AFPC Assignments Division (AFPC/DPA) will assess the outbound individual's
   qualifications and, if required, schedule appropriate training to ensure currency.
   3.6.2. If inbound foreign exchange personnel require operational transition or Mission
   Qualification Training, the host unit and applicable training office of the gaining MAJCOM
   will assess the inbound individual's qualifications, flying history, altitude chamber and
   centrifuge certifications (reference AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program,
   para 2.1.5.5. and AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew, para 1.2.), and
   English language skills in relation to the applicable PDRR, develop an appropriate training
   plan, and coordinate with the applicable branch in AFPC/DPA to obtain any required training
   quotas.

3.7. Language Requirements. Personnel selected for exchange duty must speak the host
language fluently, or receive enough language training to speak with a minimum level of
professional proficiency as identified in the PDRR.
   3.7.1. Language Training for Foreign Exchange Personnel. Unless English is the parent
   country’s primary language (e.g., Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom), nomination
   packages must include the nominee’s English Comprehension Level (ECL) and Oral
   Proficiency Interview (OPI) test scores.
      3.7.1.1. ECL. The ECL test is a four-option, multiple-choice test of listening and
      reading comprehension which is used to assess the English language proficiency of
      international military students being considered for assignment or training in the United
      States. The emphasis is on informal American English, the kind of language that might
      be used in a military training environment. ECL scores are valid for 105 calendar days.
      3.7.1.2. OPI. An OPI is a test of a candidate's English language listening
      comprehension and speaking ability, conducted under controlled conditions by two
      certified OPI raters. Candidates are rated on an 11-point scale, ranging from "0" (no
      functional proficiency) to "5" (educated native-speaker proficiency), with plus levels (0+,
      1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) assigned to candidates who demonstrate inconsistent proficiency at the
      next higher base level. The appraisal factors considered at each level (though not equally
      weighted) are vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, fluency, linguistic tasks, and socio-
      linguistic/cultural awareness. OPI ratings are valid for six months.
      3.7.1.3. Required Scores. Foreign personnel filling exchange positions as pilots,
      instructors, doctors, and lawyers must score at least 85 out of 100 on the ECL and at least
      2+/2+ on the OPI. Nominees who have not achieved the required test scores but are
      otherwise qualified for the exchange position will be scheduled to attend the 16-week
      Advanced English Language Program. In addition, unless English is the parent country’s
      primary language, all pilot nominees are required to attend the nine-week Specialized
      English Training Course (SET) regardless of ECL/OPI scores. The SET course focuses
      on building language skills and terminology associated with technical training. Foreign
      personnel filling all other exchange positions must score at least 80 out of 100 on the
      ECL and at least 2/2 on the OPI. Nominees who have not achieved the required test
      scores but are otherwise qualified for the exchange position will be scheduled to attend
      the 12-week Language Proficiency Skills course. If, upon completion of language
      training, the nominee still hasn’t achieved the required test scores, the Defense Language
      Institute English Language Center will notify SAF/IAPA of the circumstances
      surrounding the individual’s performance. SAF/IAPA will notify the host unit, through
      the CONUS Program Management Office, and if circumstances warrant, query if they are
      willing to accept the nominee’s test scores. If the host unit agrees, SAF/IAPA may grant
      a test score waiver.
   3.7.2. Language Training for USAF Exchange Personnel. Unless English is the host
   country’s primary language (e.g., Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom), nomination
   packages must include the nominee’s Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) and or
   Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) scores. Neither AFPC nor the Regional
   Program Management Office should forward nominations without a valid DLPT or DLAB
   score. If the individual does not meet the language proficiency (DLPT) requirements
AFI16-107_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                        17


   outlined in the PDRR, but achieves the required language aptitude (DLAB) score, they will
   be scheduled for foreign language training. Reference Attachment 11 for required DLAB
   scores, DLPT scores, and language training course length.
       3.7.2.1. Language Training for Spouses of USAF Exchange Personnel. Spouses may
       also receive MPEP-funded language training. If the sponsor is scheduled for foreign
       language training at the Defense Language Institute, the spouse may audit the course on a
       space available basis. If space is not available, or other constraints apply, the spouse may
       attend a publicly available certified language course or obtain a professional tutor, subject
       to authorization by the applicable Regional Program Management Office.
3.8. Tour Length. Unless otherwise specified in the MPEP Memorandum of
Agreement/Understanding (MOA/U), exchange tours are two years, plus travel and training time.
   3.8.1. Tour adjustment of USAF exchange personnel. Regional Program Management
   Offices will request approval for minor adjustments to tour length (e.g., to coincide with a
   PCS port call) from HQ AFPC/DPASF or ANG/DP as appropriate, with an info copy to
   SAF/IAPA. HQ AFPC/DPASF will provide approval or disapproval to the regional program
   management office with info copy to SAF/IAPA. For longer extensions, the Regional
   Program Management Office must also gain host country and SAF/IAPA approval.
   Extension of tours beyond one year will not be considered, and requests for tours beyond 36
   months will not normally be approved. The Regional Program Management Office must
   complete the tour adjustment request before submitting a replacement requisition.
   3.8.2. Adjusting tours of foreign exchange personnel. Foreign exchange personnel who
   desire tour adjustments must have the approval of their parent service. Host unit
   commanders of foreign exchange personnel will send a written request with justification for
   tour adjustment to the CONUS Program Management Office. The CONUS Program
   Management Office will endorse the request for adjustment and forward it to SAF/IAPA.
   SAF/IAPA will coordinate the request with the air attach of the parent service and advise the
   CONUS Program Management Office of approval or disapproval. If the parent nation
   approves the adjustment, SAF/IAPA will request HQ AFPC/DPASF publish amendments to
   orders. Once the amendments are published, SAF/IAPA will provide copies to all interested
   parties.
3.9. Modifying and Adding Positions. Modifying and adding positions to a pre-existing
international agreement will be conducted in the same manner as outlined in paragraph 3.3.1.
3.10. Deleting Positions. In accordance with the existing international agreement, either party
can request that a position be deleted when it is determined that the position no longer serves the
purpose for which it was established. USAF units hosting an exchange position will submit
formal requests for deletion to the appropriate CONUS Program Management Office. The
CONUS Program Management Office will forward requests to SAF/IAPA. Foreign units
hosting an exchange position will notify their Air Staff of a decision or desire to delete an
existing position. The foreign air staff will submit a proposal of deletion to SAF/IA, through
their air attach in Washington, DC. SAF/IA will forward the request to SAF/IAPA. Upon
receipt, SAF/IAPA will staff the request through the appropriate USAF agencies that have a
vested interest in that particular exchange. If the decision is made to delete the position,
exchange personnel currently serving in the affected billets should be permitted to fulfill their
tours unless otherwise agreed by the host and the parent nation.

                                           Chapter 4

                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Duty Positions of Exchange Personnel. Host services identify duty positions for foreign
exchange personnel, and exchange personnel normally fill positions with responsibilities equal to
their grade and qualifications. Exchange personnel perform their duties:
   4.1.1. Under the parent government’s administrative control.
   4.1.2. Under the host government’s operational control.
4.2. Legal Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to exchange personnel:
   4.2.1. USAF and foreign exchange officers shall not act in the dual capacity as an MPEP
   participant and as a representative of their parent government (e.g., a Foreign Liaison
   Officer). Foreign and U.S. exchange personnel perform the duties of the assigned position in
   the host service, not the duties of the parent service in the host country. They may not
   perform duties on behalf of the parent government during their tour. If operational
   requirements dictate that the parent government must utilize their exchange personnel to
   perform parent country tasks, they must first gain host government approval to temporarily
   remove and reassign the affected personnel from their exchange tour. If approved, exchange
   personnel will normally be required to extend their tour to fulfill their assignment obligations
   unless otherwise agreed by the host and the parent nation.
       4.2.1.1. U.S. organizations wishing to utilize USAF exchange personnel to perform
       parent country tasks will submit formal requests to the appropriate Regional Program
       Management Office outlining the purpose, duration, and rationale for reassigning the
       affected personnel from their exchange tour. The Regional Program Management Office
       will forward requests to SAF/IAPA. SAF/IAPA will coordinate the request with the
       foreign air attach in Washington, DC.
       4.2.1.2. Foreign organizations wishing to utilize their exchange personnel to perform
       parent country tasks will submit formal requests to SAF/IAPA, through their air attach in
       Washington, DC. Upon receipt, SAF/IAPA will coordinate the request through the
       appropriate USAF agencies that have a vested interest in that particular exchange.
   4.2.2. USAF and foreign exchange officers shall not serve as conduits between the
   Department of Defense and their government for requests and transmissions of classified
   military information (CMI) or controlled unclassified military information (CUMI).
   4.2.3. Foreign exchange officers shall not be assigned to command or other positions that
   would require them to exercise responsibilities that are reserved by law or regulation to an
   officer or employee of the U.S. Government. They shall not, for example, be given UCMJ
   disciplinary authority over USAF personnel, perform responsibilities of a contracting
   officer's technical representative (COTR), classified document custodian or security officer,
   or escort for foreign nationals.
   4.2.4. Foreign exchange officers shall not be permitted to commence duty in positions that
   could result in their access to CMI or CUMI that has not been authorized for release to their
   government.
 20                                    AFI16-107_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 SEPTEMBER 2013


   4.2.5. Foreign exchange officers shall not be assigned to DoD contractor facilities.
   4.2.6. Foreign exchange officers shall not have personal custody of CMI or CUMI. They
   may have access to the information during normal duty hours at the place of assignment
   when access is necessary to perform the functions in their position descriptions, if the
   information is authorized for disclosure pursuant to the DDL or other disclosure guidance.
   They may not have unsupervised access to classified libraries or operations centers, or to
   document catalogues unless the information therein is releasable to the public.
4.3. Security Instructions. Foreign and U.S. exchange personnel will:
   4.3.1. Sign Annex A to the MPEP MOA/U, entitled Certificate of Conditions and
   Responsibilities (reference Attachment 12).
   4.3.1. (EGLINAFB) Maintain the signed certificate in the unit exchange officer folder.
   4.3.2. Follow the host government’s security instructions and guidance at all times.
   4.3.3. Obtain access to classified information only as authorized by the host government, and
   only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.
   4.3.4. Recognize and respect host government policies that deny them access to certain
   information.
4.4. Safeguarding U.S. Classified Material. All disclosures and releases of military
information and materiel to foreign nationals resulting from international affairs and security
assistance activities must be authorized in accordance with AFPD 16-2, Operations Support,
Disclosure of Military Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations and
AFI 16-201. To avoid creating false impressions of U.S. intent or potentially disclosing
classified or controlled unclassified information, USAF exchange officers will not use or provide
any US government information without prior approval from their servicing Foreign Disclosure
Office.
   4.4.1. USAF personnel will disclose CMI or CUMI to foreign exchange officers only when
   they possess the appropriate security clearance and have a need-to-know based on their
   positional duties. USAF special orders assigning foreign exchange personnel to USAF units
   identifies the security clearance granted by the officer’s parent government and formally
   recognizes the technical eligibility of foreign exchange personnel to access U.S. CMI and
   CUMI as specified in the DDL. Commanders or supervisors of foreign exchange personnel
   permit access to CMI and CUMI in accordance with the DDL and only to the extent
   necessary for exchange personnel to perform their duties.
   4.4.2. Commanders, supervisors, and co-workers of foreign exchange personnel must be
   thoroughly familiar with the DDL.
   4.4.3. Exceptions to approved DDLs are processed through MAJCOM/Agency FDOs in
   accordance with existing disclosure procedures, and require SAF/IAPD approval.
   4.4.3. (EGLINAFB) Submit requests for exceptions to approved DDLs to the Eglin MPEP
   manager.
   4.4.4. Foreign exchange personnel may be granted access to and use of appropriate
   information systems (consistent with the requirements of AFI 33-202 Volume 1, Network
AFI16-107_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                           21


   and Computer Security) as listed in the DDL, but not access to information listed below
   without prior SAF/IAPD approval:
   4.4.4. (EGLINAFB) Access to information systems must be coordinated with the Eglin
   MPEP manager. See Paragraph 2.14.7.
       4.4.4.1. Restricted or Formerly Restricted Data.
       4.4.4.2. Information likely to harm, deride, or cause bias against any U.S. government
       official, agency, department or their operations, or U.S. relations with another
       government or air force.
       4.4.4.3. Any project, program, document, or information of critical sensitivity to U.S.
       national security, or identified by caveats or marking limiting access, such as, Special
       Access Required, or Limited Distribution.
       4.4.4.4. Information about cryptographic devices, communications security, or
       communications intelligence.
       4.4.4.5. Classified portions of the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide.
       4.4.4.6. General war plans or armed alert operations.
       4.4.4.7. Information that could help build an independent, strategic, national nuclear
       capability with nuclear devices and weapons, or strategic weapons launch or delivery
       vehicles.
4.5. Foreign Exchange Personnel Visits. The U.S. installation commander or organization
must approve visits of foreign exchange personnel.
   4.5.1. U.S. supervisors of foreign exchange personnel must obtain U.S. installation
   commander or organization approval if an exchange of military information is expected
   during a visit (e.g., when foreign exchange personnel attend meetings, briefings, planning
   conferences, etc.). Supervisors must advise the installation or activity commander, or
   contractor facility director of the foreign disclosure limitations before the visit. If a visit to a
   U.S. installation is not expected to result in an exchange of military information (e.g., cross-
   country flights, competitive sporting events, open house activities, etc.), then disclosure
   limitations need not be forwarded. In all cases, however, the unit to be visited must be
   informed that the individual is a foreign exchange person. Foreign exchange personnel will
   perform the visit on official TDY orders and not on Invitational Travel Orders.
   4.5.1. (EGLINAFB) Supervisors must give the Eglin MPEP manager at least 10 working
   days’ notice when their exchange officers are going on temporary duty (TDY). Supervisors
   will provide a copy of travel orders to the Eglin MPEP manager prior to travel. The MPEP
   manager will provide disclosure guidance to organizations to be visited.
   4.5.2. Foreign exchange personnel may not perform TDY in a third country without
   approval of the parent service and prior clearance. Supervisors consult the DoD Foreign
   Clearance Guide to determine specific travel clearance requirements.
4.6. U.S. Exchange Personnel Visits. U.S. exchange personnel visits to third countries will be
conducted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host country and the country or
countries to be visited and requires United States approval.
 22                                     AFI16-107_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 SEPTEMBER 2013


4.7. Ground and or Airborne Alert Duty. Participating in armed ground or airborne alert duty
could place U.S. and foreign exchange officers in situations involving active or imminent
hostilities or may jeopardize the interests of either the parent or host government. Therefore,
unless both the parent and host governments provide prior approval, U.S. and foreign exchange
personnel may perform armed alert duty only in units under the operational control of a
combined command [e.g., North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), or the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)] to which the both the parent and host governments
belong. In the case of NORAD, the NORAD Commander, with the concurrence of the parent
service, must approve alert duty.
4.8. Dress and Appearance. USAF exchange personnel will comply with guidance contained
in AFI 36-2903, Dress and Appearance of Air Force Personnel. Consistent with the intent of
U.S. laws, the Laws of Armed Conflict, and the Geneva Conventions, exchange personnel must,
at all times, retain their identity and status as members of their parent military service. As such,
exchange personnel are not authorized to wear host nation uniforms for the purposes of force
protection or unit cohesion. USAF exchange personnel may not wear foreign military clothing
or insignia except the following:
   4.8.1. Flight Suit Patches. USAF exchange personnel may wear the host unit squadron patch
   on the right sleeve of flight suits. If available, personnel may wear the host group or wing
   patch on the left sleeve. If none exists, USAF exchange personnel will wear the American
   flag emblem or, if a graduate from the appropriate school, the USAF Weapons School or
   USAF Test Pilot School patch (instructor or graduate) on the left sleeve. The USAF Wing
   and Star patch will be worn on the right breast.
   4.8.2. Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) Patches. USAF exchange personnel may wear a
   subdued host unit squadron patch on the BDU shirt above the individual’s nametape. If
   available, personnel may wear a subdued host group or wing patch on the left breast pocket.
   If host unit patches are worn, the subdued USAF Wing and Star patch will be worn on the
   right pocket.
   4.8.3. Survival Equipment. USAF exchange personnel may wear host-nation survival
   equipment if appropriate USAF equipment is not available.
   4.8.4. Flight Clothing and Equipment. USAF exchange personnel may wear host-nation
   flight clothing and equipment when required for compatibility with host-nation aircraft life-
   support systems or Nuclear, Chemical, Biological (NBC) protection systems.
4.9. Military Discipline. Exchange personnel are expected to follow the orders, instructions,
and customs of the host service when applicable and consistent with those of the parent service
and the MPEP MOA/U.
   4.9.1. Consistent with the above guidance, U.S. and foreign exchange personnel follow the
   legal orders of host service personnel senior in rank when related to their exchange duties.
   4.9.2. Exchange personnel may not discipline host service personnel.
   4.9.3. The host service may not take administrative or disciplinary action against exchange
   personnel who break military laws or ignore parent or host service instructions. They may,
   however, document violations and notify the parent service.
AFI16-107_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                     23


   4.9.4. The parent service may withdraw, with notification to the host service, their exchange
   personnel from the program and take administrative or disciplinary action.
   4.9.5. If the parent service conducts an investigation or takes administrative or disciplinary
   action against one of its own exchange personnel, the host service cooperates when asked, to
   the extent permitted by law.
4.10. Status of Exchange Personnel and Eligible Family Members. Where they exist, Status
of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) determine the legal status of U.S. armed forces personnel and
their dependents stationed in foreign countries. SOFAs set forth rights and responsibilities
between the United States and the host government on such matters as criminal and civil
jurisdiction, the wearing of the uniform, the carrying of arms, tax and customs relief, entry and
exit of personnel and property, and resolving damage claims. The applicable SOFA will
determine to what extent exchange personnel and their families are subject to the civil or
criminal jurisdiction of the host government. In the absence of a SOFA, exchange personnel and
their families are subject to host-nation jurisdiction in all respects.
4.11. Claims. An existing Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) with a host country will govern
claims procedures arising from the assignment of U.S. exchange personnel in that country. The
exchange agreement will address the handling of claims, citing any applicable SOFA provisions.
4.12. Firearm Possession and Purchase. Firearm possession and purchase must be in
compliance with host nation laws and regulations, and possession may only be for personal use.
Exchange officers may not purchase or transfer firearms for a third party.
 24                                     AFI16-107_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 SEPTEMBER 2013


                                            Chapter 5

           SUPERVISION AND RATING OF USAF EXCHANGE PERSONNEL

5.1. Supervisory Responsibilities. Exchange personnel may exercise supervisory
responsibilities similar to those of host service personnel in similar positions. However, U.S. and
foreign exchange personnel may not serve in unit command positions, administer discipline to
host government civilian employees, or exercise responsibilities that are reserved by law or
regulation to an officer or employee of the host government.
5.2. Evaluating USAF Exchange Personnel. The chief of the regional program management
office or rater:
   5.2.1. Discusses U.S. exchange personnel performance with host supervisor.
   5.2.2. Provides details on the Officer Evaluation System (OES) and Enlisted Evaluation
   System (EES) to foreign raters and exchange personnel.
   5.2.3. Requests that the host service supervisors provide a performance assessment letter on
   the U.S. exchange officer or NCO.
   5.2.4. Uses the assessment letter for performance feedback, to prepare the individual’s
   performance report, and to recommend promotions.
   5.2.5. Ensures the servicing Military Personnel Flight (MPF) receives additional reports,
   such as training reports, as required by the OES/EES.
5.3. Rating Officials.
   5.3.1. Canada. The Canadian supervisor is the rater. The Deputy Commander, Canadian
   NORAD Region (CANR/CD) is the additional rater, and reviewer. HQ NORAD is the
   management organization.

                                            Chapter 6

                OPERATIONS, DEPLOYMENT, AND TEMPORARY DUTY

6.1. Flying Status and Use of Flying Facilities. Exchange personnel on active flying status
will safely and effectively use host-country flying facilities and resources to maintain proficiency
and earn operational flying credit. USAF flight records will be maintained IAW AFI 11-401,
Aviation Management. The HARM office nearest to where the member's finance records are
maintained will manage the flight records folder.
6.2. General Flight Rules. USAF exchange personnel flying with foreign air forces will
comply with the following general guidance:
   6.2.1. USAF exchange personnel flying with foreign air forces may not perform duties in
   host-nation aircraft unless specifically authorized, physically qualified (i.e., member cannot
   be in DNIF status), and current in physiological training (if applicable). Members may not
   credit flying activity while on leave or permissive TDY. See AFI 11-401 for additional
   guidance on crediting flight time.
   6.2.2. Comply with host-nation flight directives, unless otherwise agreed to in the MPEP
   MOA/U. USAF exchange personnel are expected to use their best judgment to ensure the
   safe conduct of the flight. If flight safety is in doubt, it is the individual’s responsibility to
   inform their supervisor and suggest corrective action.
   6.2.3. Comply with host-nation crew rest directives, unless otherwise agreed to in the MPEP
   MOA/U. Each aircrew member is responsible for ensuring that they receive the proper rest
   during crew rest periods and that they do not engage in activities that would prevent them
   from doing so. If crew rest is violated or an individual does not feel adequately rested to
   perform a flight safely, it is the individual’s responsibility to inform their supervisor and
   request removal from the flight schedule.
   6.2.4. If USAF exchange personnel are unable to resolve flying issues (to include safety of
   flight or crew rest concerns) through their supervisor, they will request assistance from their
   Regional Program Management Office. The Regional Program Management Office will
   notify SAF/IAPA. If required, SAF/IAPA will coordinate resolution with AF/XOOT, the Air
   Force Flight Standards Agency, and other appropriate organizations.
6.3. Hostilities and UN Operations. U.S. and foreign exchange personnel will not be placed
on duty in areas with active hostilities, imminent hostilities, or any situation where their presence
might jeopardize the interests of either the parent or host government, including UN
Peacekeeping Missions, without first obtaining approval as outlined below.
   6.3.1. In an armed conflict involving both nations against a common enemy, exchange
   personnel will stay with their units but will not carry out any combat duties until authorized
   by the parent and host governments.
   6.3.2. In cases of armed conflict not involving both nations, U.S. and foreign exchange
   personnel must await orders from their parent government before performing any further
   military duties.
 26                                   AFI16-107_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 SEPTEMBER 2013


6.4. Deployment and Temporary Duty Travel of USAF Exchange Personnel. Deployment
of USAF exchange personnel to areas of hostilities, imminent hostilities, or any situation where
their presence may jeopardize the interests of the United States, including UN Peacekeeping
Missions and NATO activities, requires a deployment order approved by the Secretary of
Defense and signed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition, the Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy and the Department of State must approve routine Temporary
Duty Travel (TDY) to countries designated as Special Areas in the DoD Foreign Clearance
Guide. SAF/IAPA, in conjunction with AF/XOS-PI, will approve all other types of TDY travel
and deployment outside the host country. USAF exchange personnel will request approval for
deployment or TDY by submitting a Travel Request Message (Attachment 4) to the Regional
Program Management Office. Be as specific as possible when completing the form, clearly
outlining dates, locations, purpose, and duties. The Regional Program Management Office will
forward the request to AF/XOS-PI and SAF/IAPA, with courtesy copy to AFPC/DPASF,
AFPC/DPAAS4, and AFPC/DPFC, NLT 30 days prior to scheduled departure for coordination
and approval. For recurring travel, the Regional Program Management Office may request
blanket clearance and blanket approval. If blanket clearance and approval is granted, further
approval is not required but the Regional Program Management Office, AF/XOS-PI, and
SAF/IAPA must still be notified when the exchange officer conducts the approved travel.
6.5. Deployment and Temporary Duty Travel of Foreign Exchange Personnel. Foreign
exchange personnel will not be deployed or sent on TDY outside of the United States without
parent government approval. USAF units hosting foreign exchange personnel will request
approval by submitting a Travel Request Message (Attachment 4) to their CONUS Program
Management Office. Be as specific as possible when completing the form, clearly outlining
dates, locations, purpose, and duties. The CONUS Program Management Office will forward
requests to SAF/IAPA, with courtesy copy to AFPC/DPASF, AFPC/DPAAS4, and AFPC/DPFC
NLT 30 days prior to scheduled departure for coordination and approval. SAF/IAPA will then
coordinate approval or disapproval with the parent government Embassy and notify the CONUS
Program Management Office of results. The CONUS Program Management Office will relay
the results to the host unit.
6.5. (EGLINAFB)Submit requests for deployment or TDY outside of the United States to the
Eglin MPEP manager.

                           HEALTH AND WELFARE SERVICES

8.1. Using Facilities. Per the MPEP MOA/U, foreign exchange personnel and their eligible
family members are afforded access to military commissaries, exchanges, theaters, and clubs in
the same manner as their USAF counterparts, and will be issued appropriate identification cards
to support this level of access.
8.1. (EGLINAFB)Host units are responsible for arranging for appropriate identification cards to
be issued to exchange personnel and their eligible family members.
8.2. Leave and Passes. The host service grants leave and passes to exchange personnel in
accordance with parent service guidelines and the MPEP MOA/U. Exchange personnel may
observe the holiday schedule of the host service and the parent service if mutually agreed upon
by the host and parent services.
8.3. Quarters and Messing. Consistent with the MPEP MOA/U, the host service provides on-
base quarters and messing, when available, for exchange personnel on the same basis and
priority as provided for its own personnel of similar rank.

requirements contained in the MPEP MOA/U, any bilateral Reciprocal Health Care Agreements,
any applicable host country laws, and AFH 41-114, Military Health Services System (MHSS)
Matrix. To ensure receipt of eligible medical and dental services, foreign exchange personnel
and eligible family members must be registered in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting
System (DEERS). Failure to register, or update DEERS records when eligibility information
changes, may cause problems in obtaining medical and dental benefits.
