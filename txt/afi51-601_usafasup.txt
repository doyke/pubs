AFI51-601_USAFASUP 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                7


       1.6.2.3. (Added-USAFA) A quarterly (March, June, September, December) report will
       be submitted by HQ USAFA/DFLIB to HQ USAFA/CMA identifying all gifts accepted
       by the USAF Academy Library during the quarter. DFLIB reports should list
       donor/address and number/type of items, such as books, papers, etc. The Chief,
       HQ USAFA/CMA, will submit a consolidated quarterly report to HQ USAFA/CC
       identifying all gifts accepted by the USAF Academy during the quarter.
       1.6.2.4. (Added-USAFA) Any gift which memorializes an individual or group must be
       approved by the USAFA Memorial Board prior to official acceptance. For books, or
       items received by special Collections at McDermott Library, Memorial Board action is
       normally not required.
1.7. Determination of the Nature of an Offer of a Gift:
   1.7.1. Officials receiving a gift offer must initially determine whether a gift has been offered
   conditionally or unconditionally, because procedures for the acceptance of conditional or
   unconditional gifts and property accounting are similar but not identical. See Chapter 2,
   Chapter 3, and Chapter 4.
   1.7.1. (USAFA) Refer queries from donors concerning procedures for offering a gift to the
   Academy to HQ USAFA/CMA. HQ USAFA/CMA will determine whether the gift has been
   offered unconditionally or conditionally.
   1.7.2. If there is any doubt as to whether the offer is conditional or unconditional, process as
   a conditional gift. See Chapter 3.
1.8. Expenses Prior to Acceptance. Officials receiving a gift offer must inform the prospective
donor that the Air Force cannot assume responsibility for any expenses incurred before the
offered gift is accepted, even if it is in the temporary custody of the Air Force.
1.9. Custodial Responsibility. Except in unusual circumstances, the Air Force must not accept
custody of a gift before it is officially accepted. When money or negotiable instruments are
offered, advise the prospective donor to retain custody until official acceptance of the gift. If the
Air Force assumes custody, advise the donor in writing that acceptance of money or endorsement
of negotiable instruments does not constitute official acceptance of the gift. If an authorized
officer later determines that the gift cannot be accepted, refund the money or value of the
negotiable instruments upon endorsement to the prospective donor. The Air Force will not pay
interest on money or the value of negotiable instruments returned to a prospective donor
according to this instruction. If the Air Force assumes custody of gifts other than money or
negotiable instruments, inform the donor in writing that the Air Force cannot assume
responsibility for any loss or damage to the gift before it is officially accepted. Immediately turn
over money or negotiable instruments accepted for custodial purposes to the local defense
accounting officer (DAO) for deposit to Suspense Account 57F3875 pending a determination as
to official acceptance.
1.9. (USAFA)Custodial Responsibility. Report any gift offered or received to
HQ USAFA/CMA. HQ USAFA/CMA accepts custody of gifts to the USAF Academy. If the
gift has been officially accepted prior to receipt, HQ USAFA/CMA deposits funds in Account
578928.0001. If a gift is received prior to official acceptance, HQ USAFA/CMA deposits in
Suspense Account 57F3875 pending a determination of official acceptance.           Deposit
documentation is forwarded to HQ USAFA/FM.

     1.9.1. If an authorized official accepts the gift, notify the local DAO. The DAO processes an
     SF 1081, Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits, to withdraw the funds from
     Account 57F3875 and deposit them to Account 578928, if a conditional gift, or Account
     571299, if an unconditional gift.
     1.9.1. (USAFA) If a gift is deposited in Suspense Account 57F3875, a SF 1081, Voucher
     and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits, will be prepared by HQ USAFA/CMA and
     forwarded to HQ USAFA/FM upon official acceptance to withdraw the funds from Suspense
     Account 57F3875 and deposit in Account 578928.0001. HQ USAFA/FM will forward the
     SF 1081 to DFAS to be processed. After funds are deposited into the gift fund receipt
     account, HQ USAFA/CMA will prepare a letter through HQ USAFA/FM to DFAS
     requesting budget allocation into fund code 75. DFAS generates a funding document to
     HQ USAFA/FM who processes the target to the appropriate program.
     1.9.2. If an authorized official rejects the offered gift, notify the local DAO. The DAO
     processes an SF 1049, Public Voucher for Refunds, to refund money for the value or indorse
     negotiable instruments to the prospective donor.
     1.9.2. (USAFA) If a gift offer is rejected, HQ USAFA/CMA will forward a letter to
     HQ USAFA/FM requesting a check be sent back to the donor.
1.10. Records. All records must be maintained and disposed of in accordance with AFMAN
37-123, Maintenance of Air Force Records and AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition
Schedules. The command receiving final custody of gift property for use, storage or display must
retain the original letter or instruments offering the gift and a copy of the instrument accepting
the gift.
1.11. Copyrighted or Patented Items. Treat a gift of a copyrighted or patented item in the
same way as a gift of an item not so protected. However, if a copyrighted or patented gift might
be used for governmental purposes within the scope of the copyright or patent, accept it only if
the donor also grants the Air Force a royalty-free license, to the extent necessary under the
copyright or patent, or gratuitously assigns the copyright or patent to the United States.
1.12. Gifts from Foreign Governments:
     1.12.1. Gifts from foreign governments to the Department of the Air Force do not require
     congressional approval (see AFI 36-2803, The Air Force Awards and Decorations Program
     concerning decorations and awards from foreign governments).
     1.12.2. The Secretary of the Air Force has not delegated the authority to accept or reject
     those gifts offered to the Department of the Air Force by foreign governments.
     1.12.3. Offers of gifts to the United States from foreign governments made under 10 U.S.C.
     2608 will be processed according to Chapter 4.
     1.12.4. Offers of gifts to individuals from foreign governments are processed under AFI 51-
     901, Gifts From Foreign Governments.
1.13. Gifts of Real Property:
     1.13.1. The Secretary of the Air Force may accept gifts of land and interests therein for
     specific purposes (see Titles 10 U.S.C. 2601; 10 U.S.C. 2672, 10 U.S.C. 2676, 10 U.S.C.
     9771, 10 U.S.C. 9773, and annual Military Construction Authorization Acts).
AFI51-601_USAFASUP 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                               9


   1.13.2. Process offers of gifts of real property through functional channels to the official
   having authority to accept or reject the gift. Include the information specified in paragraph
   3.15 in the transmittal.
   1.13.3. When a gift of real property involves construction on Air Force land or any
   modification, alteration or addition to Air Force structures which will result in additions to
   the Air Force real property inventory, process the proposed gift to AFREA/DR who will
   forward the request, through channels, to SAF/MII. The request will contain the data required
   by paragraph 3.15 and AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property. In addition, if the
   construction costs are $500,000 or more, process a copy of the gift package through
   functional channels for reporting purposes. (See DoDI 7700.18.) Upon approval or
   acceptance of the gift, the MAJCOM will be directed to issue a right-of-entry for
   construction of the gift. Upon completion of the construction, the donor will deliver a deed to
   the Air Force installation commander, who will accept the gift on behalf of the Secretary of
   the Air Force.
1.14. Advice to Donors Concerning Tax Benefits:
   1.14.1. Air Force personnel will not advise a donor that a gift to the Department of the Air
   Force is tax deductible, but may only call the donor's attention to 10 U.S.C. 2601.
   Acceptance of a gift occurs when it is approved in writing. Written notification of acceptance
   of a gift constitutes receipt of it by the Air Force.
   1.14.2. Air Force personnel will not place any value on a gift that a donor might offer to gain
   a tax benefit, but will suggest that the donor consult a civilian expert for specific tax advice.
   1.14.3. Do not backdate an offer or accept an offer on a condition that the offer be backdated
   for tax purposes.
1.15. Gifts Not Covered by this Instruction. Promptly forward through functional channels to
HQ USAF any offers of gifts not covered by this instruction. Depending on the nature of the gift,
send it to the attention of one of the offices listed in paragraph 3.11.

                                   UNCONDITIONAL GIFTS

2.1. Method of Offering Gifts. An offer of an unconditional gift may be in any written form
and should contain sufficient information to determine whether the gift being offered is
unconditional or conditional. Offers from a company, profit or nonprofit corporation, or other
entity requires accompanying documentation evidencing authority to make the gift on behalf of
the entity. See Attachment 2. Other legal documents may also be required as needed. Consult
with the staff judge advocate (or equivalent command legal office).
2.2. Transmittal of an Offer. Any person, military or civilian, in the Department of the Air
Force who receives an unconditional offer of a gift, which he or she is not authorized to accept
on behalf of the Air Force, will send the offer through functional channels to the appropriate
authority. (See paragraphs 1.2-1.6) Process any offers which must be forwarded to the Secretarial
level through functional channels. (See paragraph 3.11 for guidance.)
   2.2.1. If the offer is forwarded to a higher command, provide a transmittal memorandum and
   recommendation for acceptance or rejection from the installation commander.
   2.2.2. The transmittal memorandum for tangible personal property, including items of
   historical significance, will:
   2.2.3. Describe the item, including the quantity, condition, material, and approximate size
   and weight.
   2.2.4. Indicate the item's present use, location, and availability.
   2.2.5. Describe any unusual or large expense of accepting and using the item.
   2.2.6. Describe the donor's present or prospective business relationships with the Department
   of the Air Force.

property as directed in paragraph 1.13.
2.4. Basics to Processing Gifts. Strictly observe the following basic rules in processing offers
of unconditional gifts.
   2.4.1. If an offer of a gift requires Secretarial level acceptance or rejection (see paragraph
   1.2), send it through functional channels to the appropriate Air Staff office for staffing to the
   Secretary of the Air Force, or his / her designee, for acceptance or rejection.
   2.4.2. A gift that may be accepted below the Secretarial level is accepted on behalf of the
   Secretary of the Air Force. When in doubt that the value of the gift, or the cost of accepting
   and maintaining it, is within limits permitting acceptance below the Secretarial level, process
   the offer to the Secretarial level for approval.
2.5. Acceptance of a Gift. The person authorized to accept a gift will:
AFI51-601_USAFASUP 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                               11


   2.5.1. Accept the gift on behalf of the Air Force in writing, and when appropriate inform the
   donor where to deliver or send the gift.
   2.5.2. Instruct the appropriate commander as to the disposition to be made of the item if it
   was delivered to a subordinate command for custody, pending acceptance.
2.6. Rejection of Gifts. The person authorized to accept an unconditional gift should not reject
any gift, unless its acceptance would not be in the best interest of the Air Force.
   2.6.1. Gifts may be rejected under the following circumstances:
       2.6.1.1. Acceptance involves the expenditure or use of funds in excess of amounts
       appropriated by Congress.
       2.6.1.2. The offered item is extremely dangerous.
       2.6.1.3. The offered item is in bad taste.
       2.6.1.4. Acceptance of the gift would raise a serious question of impropriety in light of
       the donor's present or prospective business relationships with the Department of the Air
       Force.
       2.6.1.5. The cost of acceptance and maintenance is disproportionate to any benefit.
       2.6.1.6. Acceptance would not be in the best interest of the Air Force.
2.7. Rejection in Writing. The rejection of an unconditional gift will be in writing and signed
by the person authorized to reject the gift. The letter will acknowledge receipt of the offer (or the

2.8. Transfer of Title. Transfer of title or ownership of an unconditional gift occurs when:
   2.8.1. The title to a gift of tangible or intangible personal property passes to the United
   States when the offer of the gift is accepted by a person authorized to do so.
   2.8.2. The title of a gift of real property passes to the United States when a deed to that
   property is delivered to, and is accepted by, the Corps of Engineers, acting in behalf of the
   Secretary of the Air Force. Before accepting a deed, the Corps must assure the deed conveys
   good title. If a donor offers a gift of real property by any means other than a deed, and the
   Secretary determines that the offer should be accepted, the donor must prepare and deliver a
   deed.
2.9. Accounting for or Disposing of Unconditional Gifts. After acceptance, dispose of the
following gift items as indicated:
   2.9.1. When an unconditional gift of money is accepted, turn it over to the local DAO for
   deposit to the Miscellaneous Receipts Account 571299 (Gifts to the United States not
   Otherwise Classified) of the United States Treasury.
   2.9.2. Endorse, or make payable, gifts in the form of negotiable or nonnegotiable
   instruments to the Treasurer of the United States, and process them in the same manner as
   gifts of money.
   2.9.3. The disposition of tangible personal property depends on its category:
       2.9.3.1. Gifts of historical significance are processed according to AFI 84-101,
       Historical Products, Services and Requirements. Direct communication between the Air

     collection, inventory, and disposition of Air Force historical properties is authorized.
     2.9.3.2. The Air Force Historian’s Art Branch (SAF/AART) will examine artistic gifts
     and determine their historical significance. When an artist or donor presents an original

     print or photograph of the artwork to SAF/AART. If the item is accepted for inclusion in
     the USAF Art Collection (see AFI 81-104), SAF/AART assumes responsibility for the
     artwork and controls its future use. If the donated artwork is not accepted in the USAF
     Art Collection, but is nonetheless accepted as a gift by an authorized official, the local
     unit assumes control of the artwork. No one may make reproductions of artwork in the
     USAF Art Collection without the permission of SAF/AART. No one may make
     reproductions of other artwork accepted as gifts without the permission of the
     commander controlling the artwork. The purely commercial use of any artwork accepted
     by the Air Force is prohibited.
     2.9.3.3. Process gifts of tangible personal property for current use according to paragraph
     3.11. Use these items for the purpose indicated by the accepting authority.

                                            Chapter 3

                                    CONDITIONAL GIFTS

3.1. The Method of Offering Conditional Gifts. An offer of a conditional gift made under 10
U.S.C. 2601 from an individual may be in any written form, signed by the donor, witnessed, and
dated. However, if the donor is a corporation, one of the corporate officers must sign the offer on
behalf of the entity and include a certificate evidencing authority to make the gift. See
Attachments Attachment 2 and Attachment 3. Tailoring of the offer is acceptable as warranted
by the circumstances in each case.
3.2. Acceptance of Conditional Gifts. The following policies govern the acceptance of all
conditional gifts:
   3.2.1. Accept all conditional gifts unless it is not in the best interests of the Air Force to do
   so.
   3.2.2. If an offer of a gift requires Secretarial level acceptance or rejection, the person
   receiving the gift offer should forward it through functional channels to HQ USAF for
   acceptance or rejection by, or by direction of, the Secretary of the Air Force.
3.3. Who May Accept. The Secretary of the Air Force or designee may accept conditional gifts
at the Secretarial level. Authorized persons below the Secretarial level, as provided in paragraphs
1.3 through 1.6, are also authorized to accept conditional gifts. When in doubt that the value of
the gift, or the cost of accepting and maintaining it, is within limits permitting acceptance below
the Secretarial level, the person receiving the gift offer will process the offer to the Secretarial
level. The person who accepts a gift below secretarial level will submit a copy of the letter
accepting the gift to the appropriate functional activities. See paragraph 3.11.
3.4. Form of Acceptance. Use the sample letters provided in attachments Attachment 4 and
Attachment 5 as a guide. Modify the acceptance when the circumstances warrant it. Tailoring is
appropriate if the offer contains special conditions or arrangements that should be acknowledged.
3.4. (USAFA)Forms of Acceptance. Prepare and coordinate with HQ USAFA/CMA an offer
of gift certification (AFI 51-601, Attachment 2 or 3) and send it to the donor. If a check is
already in hand from a donor, an offer of gift certification is not required; however, a
memorandum stating the donor’s name, address, and purpose of the gift must accompany the
check submitted to HQ USAFA/CMA. Upon return of a completed offer of gift or check with
memorandum, HQ USAFA/CMA:
   3.4.1. (Added-USAFA) Determines whether the gift is suitable for acceptance.
   3.4.2. (Added-USAFA) Prepares an AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, with a
   memorandum of acceptance and thanks (AFI 51-601, Attachment 4 or 5) to the donor from
   the appropriate acceptance authority.
   3.4.3. (Added-USAFA) Coordinates the staff package, including the offer of gift
   certification and all related correspondence, through all affected agencies plus the Staff Judge
   Advocate (HQ USAFA/JA).
 14                                                AFI51-601_USAFASUP NOVEMBER 2013


   3.4.4. (Added-USAFA) If the gift is intangible personal property, coordinates through
   USAFA/FM. If the gift is a memorial, present it to the USAFA Memorial Board for approval
   prior to acceptance.
3.5. Acceptance at Secretarial Level. When acceptance of a conditional gift requires
Secretarial approval, the Air Staff office concerned will prepare the letter of acceptance and
submit it, with the approval of the Office of the Chief of Staff, to the Office of the Secretary of
the Air Force, or his /her designee, for signature.
3.6. Rejection. The authorized official who may accept a conditional gift will make the
decision to reject it in writing. Gifts may be rejected under the following circumstances:
   3.6.1. Acceptance involves the expenditure or use of funds in excess of amounts
   appropriated by Congress.
   3.6.2. The offered item is extremely dangerous.
   3.6.3. The offered item is in poor taste.
   3.6.4. Acceptance of the gift would raise a serious question of impropriety in light of the
   donor's present or prospective business relationships with the Department of the Air Force.
   3.6.5. The cost of acceptance and maintenance is disproportionate to any benefit derived
   from it.
   3.6.6. The acceptance of the gift would not be in the best interest of the Air Force.
3.7. Contents of Rejection Letter. The rejection of a conditional gift must be in writing and
signed by the authority that is authorized to accept it. The letter must acknowledge receipt of the
offer (or the gift) and briefly explain why the Air Force cannot accept it.
3.8. Rejection at the Secretarial Level. When rejection is at the Secretarial level, the Air Staff
office concerned will submit a proposed letter of rejection (e.g. attachment Attachment 4 or
Attachment 5) with approval of the Office of The Chief of Staff, to the Office of the Secretary
of the Air Force, or designee, for signature.
3.9. Initial Receipt of a Conditional Offer of Gift. Any person, military or civilian, in the
Department of the Air Force may receive a conditional offer of a gift from a donor and may also
receive the gift item, subject to paragraph 1.9.
3.10. Forwarding a Conditional Offer to Higher Level. Seek the lowest level of acceptance
possible in processing any offer of gift. When it is necessary to forward an offer to a higher level
for acceptance (or rejection) including the Secretarial level, the memorandum of transmittal, with
offer of gift documentation attached, must be forwarded through appropriate functional channels.
The memorandum should contain pertinent information concerning the proposed offer to
include:
   3.10.1. A description of the item (and the quantity), its condition, material, and approximate
   size and weight.
   3.10.2. State the conditions and limitations of the offer.
   3.10.3. Explain the present use, location, and availability of the item.
   3.10.4. Describe any unusual or large expense involved in accepting and using the item.

   3.10.5. Describe the donor's present or prospective business relationships with the
   Department of the Air Force.
   3.10.6. Summarize the item’s significance to the Air Force. Include the recommendation of
   the installation commander (or equivalent) transmitting the offer (and any intermediate
   commander’s coordination) for acceptance or rejection.
3.11. Processing Gifts for Current Use through Functional Channels. All offers of gifts of
personal property for current use, (see terms in Attachment 1) are staffed through functional
channels to the appropriate level that can accept or reject the offer. For example, forward an offer
of equipment items valued in excess of $50,000 through logistics channels to HQ USAF/IL,
Washington DC 20330; medical and nonmedical items for use in a medical facility to HQ
USAF/SG, Bolling AFB, DC 20332; and automatic data processing equipment to HQ USAF/SC,
Washington DC 20330.
   3.11.1. (Added-USAFA) The Chairperson of the Cadet Awards Council establishes awards
   for a 5-year period, renewable for additional 5-year periods with the concurrence of both the
   donor and the USAF Academy. Donors may contribute sums sufficient to cover awards for a
   period of 1 year or 5 years. HQ USAFA/CMA maintains proper accountability for all gifts
   accepted. Each award is officially designated by purpose and donor.
   3.11.2. (Added-USAFA) HQ USAFA/DFLIB processes gifts offered to the McDermott
   Library as specified in paragraph 3.2., in the basic, and sends the donor a memorandum of
   acknowledgment at the time each gift is received. Books or other library-related material
   valued at less than $50 and received by the library directly from a publisher for sample or
   review may be acknowledged by a card signed by the Director, HQ USAFA/DFLIB.

that requires Secretarial approval to the Air Force Museum, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433,
and a gift of personal papers to the Air Force Historian, HQ USAF/HO, Bolling AFB, DC 20332.
   3.12.1. Gifts of historical significance are processed according to AFI 84-101, Historical
   Products Services and Requirements.
   3.12.2. Direct communication between the Air Force Historian and the Director, Air Force
   Museum; and other commands on the collection, inventory, and disposition of Air Force
   historical properties is authorized.
3.13. Processing Items of Artistic Significance. When an artist or donor presents an original
artwork as a gift, or delivers a commissioned artwork to a unit or base, forward a color print or
photograph of the artwork to SAF/AART, 1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-
1720, with a summary of the item’s historical significance to the Air Force and the name of the
artist.
   3.13.1. The Air Force Historian’s Art Branch (SAF/AART) will examine artistic gifts and
   determine their historical significance. If the item is accepted for inclusion in the USAF Art
   Collection, SAF/AART assumes responsibility for the artwork and controls its future use. If
   the donated artwork is not accepted in the USAF Art Collection, but is nonetheless accepted

      DE/ADRA with a request for Budget and Allocation Authority documents.

       3.17.4.5. If the nature of the conditions of the gift is such that the unused funds cannot be
       used for another purpose or by another activity, advise the donor of the amount of unused
       funds and ask him or her to provide disposition instructions. Either refund the unused gift
       balance to the donor or consider it a new gift, depending on the donor's instructions. If
       the donor does not desire a refund, do not process the balance as a new offer of a gift,
       provided the donor's disposition instructions authorize use of the funds for a purpose or
       by an activity other than that indicated in the original offer of gift.
       3.17.4.6. If the condition of the gift allows use of the residual funds by activities other
       than those originally funded, the unused balance should be identified, through channels,
       to SAF/FMPB as available for withdrawal and subsequent reallocation to another
       activity. For example, the Secretary (or other authorized official) may withdraw the

   ACQUIRED UNDER PROVISIONS OF 10 U.S.C. 2601."
3.18. Transfer of Title. With respect to conditional gifts of real property under 10 U.S.C. 2601,
the offer of a gift is merely an offer to transfer title to the property to the Secretary of the Air
Force acting on behalf of the United States of America. With respect to all other conditional gifts
under 10 U.S.C. 2601, acceptance of the offer of a gift effects a transfer of title to the gift
property to the Secretary of the Air Force acting on behalf of the United States.
3.19. Sale of Gift Property. Only the Secretary of the Air Force may, except when specifically
prohibited by the terms of the offer, sell any gift or property received under 10 U.S.C. 2601.
Treat the proceeds of sale in the same manner as a gift of money. Deposit the proceeds in the
appropriate account. They are subject to disbursement at the discretion of the Secretary of the Air
Force, according to the terms and conditions of the gift. AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property
governs the disposal of all real property.

McDermott Library. The proceeds of these sales will be treated in the same manner as a gift of
money and will be deposited in an appropriate gift fund account through USAFA/FM.

                                           Chapter 4

          CONDITIONAL GIFTS NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER 10 U.S.C. 2601

4.1. General Provisions. The Secretary of Defense is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2608 to accept
or reject, on behalf of the United States, any gift made on condition that it be used by the
Department of Defense.
   4.1.1. Limitations.
       4.1.1.1. The statute does not modify or repeal the authority to accept conditional gifts
       granted under any other provisions of law.
       4.1.1.2. This statute does not impair the authority of the Secretary of the Air Force under
       10 U.S.C. 2601 to accept or reject a conditional gift.
4.2. Procedures for Accepting Gifts Other Than Under 10 U.S.C. 2601. When an Air Force
command receives a conditional gift (offer of a gift) and determines that the gift cannot be
accepted under 10 U.S.C. 2601 and under Chapter 3, take the following steps:
   4.2.1. Money or Other Intangible Personal Property. The receiving command:
       4.2.1.1. Acknowledges receipt of the gift and its referral to the Department of Defense,
       but will not indicate acceptance or rejection of the gift on behalf of the United States.
       4.2.1.2. Sends the money or other intangible personal property, together with the
       acknowledgment and original correspondence, to DFAS-DE/ALA, Denver CO 80279.
       4.2.1.3. Recommends, in the letter of transmittal to DFAS-DE/ALA, acceptance or

   4.2.2. Real Property or Tangible Personal Property. The command receiving a
   conditional offer of a gift of real property or tangible personal property:
       4.2.2.1. Acknowledges receipt of the offer and advises the donor of its referral to the
       Department of Defense, but will not indicate acceptance or rejection of the gift on behalf
       of the United States.
       4.2.2.2. Notifies SAF/FMPB and recommends acceptance or rejection of the gift.
       SAF/FMPB will, in turn, notify the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).
       4.2.2.3. Sends a copy of the acknowledgment with notification and recommendation to
       SAF/FMPB.
4.3. Doubtful Cases. In case of doubt as to whether a conditional gift may properly be
accepted under 10 U.S.C. 2601 or whether it must be processed under 10 U.S.C. 2608, resolve it
in favor of 10 U.S.C. 2601 and process the offer of gift under Chapter 3 of this instruction. HQ
USAF will make the final determination, and will direct that the gift be transmitted to DFAS or
the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), if appropriate.
AFI51-601_USAFASUP 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                              21

agency concerned of the action taken.

                                            Chapter 5

                      GIFTS FOR DISTRIBUTION TO INDIVIDUALS

5.1. Scope. This chapter establishes procedures for the acceptance or rejection of gifts offered
to the Air Force for distribution to Air Force personnel. It does not apply to gifts offered to Air
Force personnel from sources outside the Department of Defense, (see 5 C.F.R. 2635 Subpart B
[JER section 2-100]), to gifts among Air Force personnel, (see 5 C.F.R. 2635 Subpart C [JER
section 2-100]), gifts given to nonappropriated funds (see AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated
Funds, Chapter 5 ), or to gifts offered to Air Force personnel from foreign governments, (see
AFI 51-901, Gifts from Foreign Governments). This chapter refers to gifts of personal items
offered to the Air Force for the benefit of, and distribution to, Air Force members and
employees.
5.2. Acceptable Gifts. The Air Force may accept under this chapter only those gifts of a
desirable and useful nature, that contribute to the health, comfort, convenience, or morale of
military personnel. (For example: playing cards, books, or written material for hospitalized
members.) Tobacco products and alcoholic beverages are not considered acceptable gifts.
5.2. (USAFA)Acceptable Gifts. Academy agencies travel throughout the country to represent
the USAF Academy. Audiences and sponsors of these groups often present gifts to the group in
appreciation for their performance or service. Such gifts are usually considered gifts to the
Academy and must be reported to HQ USAFA/CMA by the person in charge immediately upon
the group’s return to the Academy.
5.3. Responsibilities Assigned.
   5.3.1. Gifts offered to the Air Force for distribution to Air Force members and employees
   must be accepted or rejected by the Secretary of the Air Force, or designee, in compliance
   with the provisions of paragraphs 1.1 through 1.6 of this instruction. The total value of the
   gift will be used to determine the authority for accepting or rejecting gifts processed under
   this Chapter. (For example, if the total value of a gift is less than $50,000, the commander of
   a major command (or his delegee), the commander of a field operating agency, or the
   commander of an Air Force medical treatment facility may accept or reject the gift,
   regardless of the cost of items to be distributed to individual personnel or employees.) Note:
   Before accepting proposed gifts that would be distri-buted under the procedures of paragraph
   5.3.4, below, coordinate with the Commander, Air Force Services Agency, in order to
   determine whether acceptance would be in the best interest of the Air Force.
   5.3.2. After acceptance, CONUS commanders may receive gifts intended for distribution to
   personnel solely within their command, and determine the method of distribution.
   Commanders may delegate this authority to subordinate commanders.
   5.3.3. After acceptance, overseas commanders may receive gifts from donors located within
   their geographic area and intended for distribution to personnel solely within their command.
   The overseas major commander may also determine the method of distribution. Commanders
   may delegate this authority to subordinate commanders.
   5.3.4. After acceptance, the Commander, Air Force Services Agency is designated to receive
   gifts from persons or organizations in the United States for distribution to overseas
AFI51-601_USAFASUP 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                            23


   commands, and for CONUS distribution when gifts are intended for military personnel or
   employees of more than one MAJCOM. The Commander, Air Force Services Agency is also
   responsible for determining the method of distribution.
5.4. Advertising and Publicity.
   5.4.1. By the Donor of the Gift. Do not place restrictions on advertising or publicity by the
   donor. However, such advertising or publicity should not imply an endorsement of the
   product by the Air Force or any Air Force member or employee.
       5.4.1.1. A donor may place on the gift a marking which identifies the property as being
       donated by a particular person, group, or organization. However, the marking must be in
       good taste and must not be worded so that it endorses (or implies an endorsement of) the
       product by the Air Force or any Air Force member or employee.
       5.4.1.2. Receipt by an Air Force commander of a gift so marked will not be construed as
       either advertising or publicity of the gift by the Air Force.
   5.4.2. By the Commander Receiving the Gift for Distribution:
       5.4.2.1. Do not publicly acknowledge the receipt of the gift, except in special cases
       specifically authorized by the Secretary of the Air Force. The commander authorized to
       receive the gift will acknowledge its receipt by an appropriate letter to the donor on
       behalf of the military personnel of the command concerned.
       5.4.2.2. Do not grant special concessions or privileges to the donor.
       5.4.2.3. Do not initiate publicity for the donor.
5.5. Transportation Charges:
   5.5.1. Packaging and Transportation Charges Paid by the Donor. Except for the gifts
   discussed in 5.5.2, accept gifts under this chapter only if the donor pays all packaging and
   transportation charges to the following points:
       5.5.1.1. Gifts for Distribution in the CONUS. The distribution point or points
       designated by the receiving commander or Commander, Air Force Services Agency.
       5.5.1.2. Gifts for Distribution in Overseas Commands. The port of embarkation or
       other coastal activity designated by the Commander, Air Force Services Agency, or to the
       point designated by the receiving overseas commander. Overseas commanders must
       make all necessary arrangements with the port of embarkation for shipment of gift
       property to its destination in the overseas area.
   5.5.2. Transportation Charges Paid by the Air Force. The Air Force may pay
   transportation charges from current appropriations for gifts in this chapter, under the
   following conditions:
       5.5.2.1. The gift consists of supplies or materials that would otherwise be purchased with
       appropriated funds and transported to their destination at Government expense.
       5.5.2.2. No conditions of any kind are attached to the gift.
5.6. Temporary Custody of Gift Items. If an offer of gift under this chapter is made to
someone who is not authorized to accept it, and the donor specifically requests that the Air Force
 24                                            AFI51-601_USAFASUP NOVEMBER 2013


assume custody of the gift while the offer is processed, inform the donor that the Air Force
cannot assume responsibility for any loss or damage to the property before it is officially
accepted and delivered to a point designated under paragraph 5.5.1.1 or paragraph 5.5.1.2.

Gift to the Department of the Air Force—A gift offered to the United States, or to the
Secretary of the Air Force acting on behalf of the United States.
Conditional Gift—A gift is conditional if offered with specified limitations upon its ownership,
use, expenditure, or disposition. (Examples: A gift of $5,000 to Base X; a gift to Base X to buy
speakers for base theater; a gift of surgical equipment to be used at a specific Military Medical
Center; donation of services valued at $5,000 to build a golf pavilion on Base X’s golf course; a
gift of historical memoirs to the AF Museum to be displayed at a specific location.)
Unconditional Gift—A gift offered without limitation upon its ownership, use, expenditure, or
disposition. (Examples: A bequest of cash to the United States Air Force; a gift of fire protection
equipment to the Air Force; a gift of historical memoirs to the AF.)
Tangible Personal Property—As used here, tangible personal property is divided into three
categories: Items of Historical Significance; Items of Artistic Significance; and Items of Current
Use.
Items of Historical Significance—Historical property items, including personal papers, having
value because of their association with the history of the US Air Force.
Items of Artistic Significance—Paintings, prints, sculptures, and other art objects.
Items for Current Use—All other goods, wares and merchandise, including items which, upon
acceptance, are used by or for the benefit of some command, organization, or institution under
the jurisdiction of the Department of the Air Force.
Intangible Personal Property—Money, checks, money orders, drafts, bonds, shares of stock,
and similar documents with a present or future value.
Real Property—For the purpose of this instruction, real property includes any right, title, or
interest in land and buildings, fixed improvements, utilities, and other permanent type additions
to land. All offers of gifts involving construction on Air Force land or any modification,
alteration, or addition to Air Force structures which will result in additions to the Air Force real
property inventory will be considered and processed under this instruction and AFI 32-9001,
Acquisition of Real Property, as gifts of real property.
Functional Channels—Counterpart organizations (e.g. civil engineering, logistic, medical,
communications and others) in the chain of command that process and route an offer of gift to
the Air Force official that has authority to accept or reject it.
Gifts of Services—Performance of work or labor on behalf of the Air Force with no expectation
of payment.

      IC 99-1 TO AFI 51-601, GIFTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE


15 NOVEMBER 1999

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This interim change (IC) 99-1 clarifies that the acceptance level for conditional gifts is that
specified in paragraphs 1.3 through 1.6 and adds an item of pertinent information to be
transmitted with an offer of conditional gift when forwarding to a higher level for acceptance.
See the last attachment of the publication for the complete IC. A bar (|) preceding a paragraph
indicates changes from the previous edition.

3.3. Who May Accept. The Secretary of the Air Force or designee may accept conditional gifts at
the Secretarial level. Authorized persons below the Secretarial level, as provided in paragraphs
1.3 through 1.6, are also authorized to accept conditional gifts. When in doubt that the value of
the gift, or the cost of accepting and maintaining it, is within limits permitting acceptance below
the Secretarial level, the person receiving the gift offer will process the offer to the Secretarial
level. The person who accepts a gift below secretarial level will submit a copy of the letter
accepting the gift to the appropriate functional activities. See paragraph 3.11.
3.10.6. Summarize the item’s significance to the Air Force. Include the recommendation of the
installation commander (or equivalent) transmitting the offer (and any intermediate commander’s
coordination) for acceptance or rejection.

    IC 2003-L TO AFI 51-601, GIFTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE


26 NOVEMBER 2003
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This interim change (IC) 2003-l changes the OPR responsible for receiving and distributing gifts
to: 1) persons in overseas commands, and 2) military personnel or employees of more than one
MAJCOM.
5.3.1. Gifts offered to the Air Force for distribution to Air Force members and employees must
be accepted or rejected by the Secretary of the Air Force, or designee, in compliance with the
provisions of paragraphs 1.1 through 1.6 of this instruction. The total value of the gift will be
used to determine the authority for accepting or rejecting gifts processed under this Chapter. (For
example, if the total value of a gift is less than $50,000, the commander of a major command (or
his delegee), the commander of a field operating agency, or the commander of an Air Force
medical treatment facility may accept or reject the gift, regardless of the cost of items to be
distributed to individual personnel or employees.) Note: Before accepting proposed gifts that
would be distri-buted under the procedures of paragraph 5.3.4, below, coordinate with the
Commander, Air Force Services Agency, in order to determine whether acceptance would be in
the best interest of the Air Force.
5.3.4. After acceptance, the Commander, Air Force Services Agency is designated to receive
gifts from persons or organizations in the United States for distribution to overseas commands,
and for CONUS distribution when gifts are intended for military personnel or employees of more
than one MAJCOM. The Commander, Air Force Services Agency is also responsible for
determining the method of distribution.
5.5.1.1. Gifts for Distribution in the CONUS. The distribution point or points designated by
the receiving commander or Commander, Air Force Services Agency.
5.5.1.2. Gifts for Distribution in Overseas Commands. The port of embarkation or other
coastal activity designated by the Commander, Air Force Services Agency, or to the point
designated by the receiving overseas commander. Overseas commanders must make all
necessary arrangements with the port of embarkation for shipment of gift property to its
destination in the overseas area.
