This instruction implements and extends the guidance in AFI24-302, Vehicle Management. This
instruction establishes procedures for the management, maintenance, acquisition, and disposal of
base-operated Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyances and Neighborhood Electric
Vehicles, also known as low-speed vehicles. This instruction also establishes the Fleet Card
reimbursement policy for units/individuals and Alternate Fuels Policy. It applies to all
organizations and tenant units attached to Luke Air Force Base (Luke AFB) to include Air Force
Reserve Command but not Air National Guard Units. Note: This instruction does not apply to
Falcon Dunes Golf Course. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to
the Office of Primary Responsibility using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air
Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). This publication may be
supplemented at any level, but all direct supplements must be routed to the OPR of this
publication for coordination prior to certification and approval. The authorities to waive
wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”)

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Due to AFI 24-302 replacing AFI 23-302, Vehicle Management, the series was changed on this
instruction. The Luke AFB Form 160, Operator’s Inspection and Trouble Report Guide, is
obsolete and will no longer be used.
1. Low Speed Vehicle (LSV) and Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyance
(OGMVC).
     1.1. Non-Registered Equipment Management (non-REMS) System LSVs are conveyances
     with a maximum speed of 25 mph and meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. All
     others will be considered OGMVCs, e.g., rangers, four wheelers, and bobcats. Use of
     OGMVCs/LSVs on Luke AFB is an integral component of the Trip Reduction Program and
     assists in reducing air pollution.
     1.2. Proper management and maintenance of OGMVCs/LSVs ensures extended life span and
     compliance with manufacturer requirements for warranty coverage. The OGMVCs and/or
     LSVs may be periodically recalled to support AF/wing-sponsored events such as parades, air
     shows, distinguished visitor visits, etc.
     1.3. Luke AFB has reached its ceiling of OGMVCs/non-REMS reportable LSVs; future
     requests for OGMVC purchases will be on a one-for-one basis. Any self-propelled assets
     providing a basic transportation capability (e.g., golf carts, all terrain vehicles, quad-runners,
     Bobcats) not meeting specifications of Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations 571.500 Federal
     Motor Vehicle Standard, will be categorized as OGMVCs. Initial or one-for-one
     replacement vehicle requests must be coordinated through the Equipment Accountability
     Element, Ground Safety, the Vehicle Management & Analysis OGMVC/LSV Program
     Manager, to the 56th Logistics Readiness Squadron Commander for approval then to
     Contracting for the actual purchase.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Vehicle Management Flight (56 LRS/LGRV) will establish and manage the LSV
     Program for the 56th Fighter Wing (56 FW). The 56 LRS/LGRV will appoint an LSV
     Program Manager to serve as the central point of contact for the wing on all LSV issues.
        2.1.1. The LSV Program Manager is responsible for:
            2.1.1.1. Loading and tracking scheduled inspections in the On-Line Vehicle
            Interactive Management System (OLVIMS) for the purpose of notifying
            organizations of pending maintenance IAW AFI 24-302, Para 4.77.
            2.1.1.2. Coordinating and monitoring OGMVC/LSV purchases, transfers, and
            dispositions.
            2.1.1.3. Conducting acceptance inspections on all new OGMVCs/LSVs and ensuring
            identification data is loaded into OLVIMS before releasing the asset to the owning
            organization.
            2.1.1.4. Organization commanders must maintain current letters of appointment for
            Vehicle Control Officers (VCOs) & Vehicle Control Noncommissioned Officers
            (VCNCOs) and the letters will be reviewed during the annual program manager's
LUKEAFBI24-302 30 APRIL 2014                                                                  3


          staff assistance Visit. Any changes due to permanent change of station, separation, or
          retirement will require updated appointment letters.
   2.2. The VCO/VCNCOs are responsible for:

          2.2.3.1. Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. Overdue OGMVC/LSV safety
          inspections will be considered a safety violation and the vehicle will be deemed

          safety inspections.
   2.3. Operators are responsible for conducting daily, weekly, and monthly tire pressure
   checks and battery inspections.

7. Acquisition.
   7.1. As of 29 October 2007, LSVs will no longer be purchased locally. All LSVs will be
   purchased through the annual Vehicle Buy Submission. Organizations that want to convert
   General Purpose vehicles to LSVs can request to do so by submitting an AF Form 601,
   Equipment Action Request, routed through HQ AETC.
   7.2. Purchase requests for OGMVCs will be accompanied by a paper copy of AF IMT 1768,
   Staff Summary Sheet, with Manufacturer Specification Sheet attachment in the following
   format.

Table 7.1. Sample format.
 56 LRS/LGRVMA (validate X-registration of turn-in and OGMVC purchase request)
 56 FW/SEG (coordination)
 56 LRS/LGRMCE (coordination)
 56 LRS/LGRV (Flight Chief coordination)
 56 LRS/CC (approval)
 HQ AETC/A4RMV (approval)
 56 MSG/CC (approval)
 56 CONS/LGCA (purchase)
   7.3. The organization will prepare and provide an AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-in Request, to
   Vehicle Management prior to approving any requests.
   7.4. All OGMVCs will be procured and managed as equipment items. The OGMVCs and
   non-REMS reportable LSVs will be loaded in Air Force Equipment Management System and
   managed on the R14. Existing LSVs will be managed as equipment items.
   7.5. Organizations will have 15 days to load OGMVCs/LSVs on their R14. The OGMVCs
   will be assigned prime National Stock Number (NSN) 2340-00-585-7495 and LSVs will be
   assigned prime NSN 2340-00-50-3900.
8. Disposal.

     8.1. Disposal and transfers must be coordinated through the LSV Program Manager.
     8.2. All OGMVCs/LSVs will be processed for disposal by owning organizations. Local
     Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) procedures will be utilized for the
     disposal of organizational-owned government equipment.
     8.3. License plates must be turned in to the LSV Program Manager before OGMVCs/LSVs
     are processed through DRMO.
9. Charging Stations. In order to reduce the load on base infrastructures to charge
OGMVCs/LSVs, 56 FW charging stations must be used to the maximum extent possible.
10. Driving. Driving OGMVCs/LSVs on base requires following the same regulations and
policies that apply to operating government vehicles.
11. Alternate Fuels Policy. Luke AFB currently uses B20 Bio diesel fuel for its fleet because it
is the only diesel fuel available. Vehicles that operate on MoGas do not use alternative fuels
because the nearest station is not geographically close to the base. HQ AETC has provided a
waiver due to the unavailability of the alternative fuels.
12. Unauthorized Fleet Card Policy. If an individual fails to follow training, the Statement of
Understanding, or established card use policies, that individual's unit is responsible to reimburse
the organization responsible (56 LRS) for making the non-fuel payment to the vendor, Wright
Express. The individual's organization can take action to recoup losses from the individual if
necessary.
13. Material Control.
     13.1. Issue requests are sent to Customer Support instead of Demand Processing.
     13.2. The Vehicle Fleet Manager or Vehicle Maintenance Superintendent will be briefed on
     Mission Capable and Non-Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) status weekly during Estimated
     Time of Completion meetings. Unsatisfactory status is any vehicle that is in NMCS status
     for 30 or more days on a case-by-case analysis.
14. Standard Base Supply Accountable Record Inventory Discrepancy Management.
     14.1. All Inventory adjustments must be coordinated with the 56 LRS Physical Inventory
     Control Section.
     14.2. All reverse-post actions must be coordinated with the 56 LRS Customer Support
     Section.
