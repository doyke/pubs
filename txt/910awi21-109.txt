SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been administratively revised and must be completely reviewed. Major
changes include the modification of procedures.
1. Security and control.
   1.1. Due to lack of facilities and manning, tools rooms are not available in all work centers;
   therefore, it is the Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge’s (NCOIC) / supervisor’s
   responsibility for security and control of tools and equipment.
 2                                                          910AWI21-109 4 FEBRUARY 2013


2. Inventory requirements.
     2.1. Shift inventories will be conducted at the beginning and end of shift; this will be
     documented in the Tool Control Accountability System (TCMax). CTK`s are not required to
     be opened for shift inventory, personnel will ensure all equipment is present at the beginning
     and end of shift. Document inventory in TCMax by creating an EID number assigned to be
     used for the purpose of tracking the shift inventory.
     2.2. CTK inventory requirements.
        2.2.1. All CTK inventories will be documented in TCMax utilizing the agreed upon
        TCMAX Master Inventory List (MIL), an example will be located on the 910
        Maintenance Group (MXG) base computer share drive under the TCMAX folder. Tool
        storage locations do not require a TCMAX MIL but should have an inventory of content.
        2.2.2. Decentralized CTK sign out procedures: The tool box will be signed out at the
        owning work center, a folder identified by the tool box EID will be taken to the box, this
        will contain the AFRC 175, 177 the CTK will be inventoried and member will sign the
        AFRC 177. Custodial responsibility begins when inventory is completed and AFRC 177
        is signed. At the end of use another person will inventory the box and sign the AFRC
        177, this will be returned to the CTK room enabling the tool box to be signed back in.
        Lost, broken, or removed tools will be annotated on the AFRC 175, Missing/Removed
        Tools and Equipment, and transcribed into TCMax. Decentralized CTK’s are those which
        are owned by one work center and stored at another for ease of production i.e. ISO.
     2.3. Deployed CTK’s deployed from home station/cross country will be signed out long
     term to the deploying location from the owning work center. All deployed CTKs will add the
     AFRC 174, Lost Tool/Object Report in addition to the AFRC 175 and AFRC 177. The
     senior ranking maintenance person for the mission will identify a CTK custodian for the
     deployment. Furthermore, the CTK custodian will be responsible to load all deploying CTKs
     into deploying database. Ensure that all deployed CTK’s are accounted for at the beginning
     and end of each shift. Additionally, CTK’s will be signed out and back in using the AFRC
     Form 177 if a TCMax system is not available.
     2.3.1. Aircraft without maintenance personnel, the CTK is the responsibility of the aircraft
     commander and will be signed out/in on the AFRC Form 177 when used by aircrew
     members.
3. Warranted tools.
     3.1. Ensure broken or defective tools are disposed of properly and CTK EID is properly
     removed; usually a one-for-one swaps with the warrantor.
4. Consumable, Hazmat and Replacement tools.
     4.1. Expendable hand tools such as blades, apexes, files, wire brushes, acid brushes and
     other shop designated items will be controlled in TCMax. Items can be loaded as
     replacement or special tools.
        4.1.1. Replacement tools will be accounted for in TCMax as spares, they will be stored
        in a limited accessible area, quantities of replacement tools will be tracked in TCMax and
        quarterly inventories will be approved by the Flight Chief.
910AWI21-109 4 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   3


      4.1.2. Hazardous Material (Hazmat) items that are one time use items such as oil,
      hydraulic cans and mixing compounds need not be tracked in TCMax. They will follow
      all HAZMAT and base supply procedures. Multi-use HAZMAT items which are
      dispatchable, will be treated like a tool, added to TCMax and will be signed out and
      signed in after use. The HAZMAT storage locker must have an inventory listing of all
      stored items with items tracked in TCMax. All HAZMAT lockers must be secured .
5. Procedures.
   5.1. Tool sets are identified on the MIL by total number of items in the set (e.g., Allen
   wrench set - 9 each Allen wrenches + container for a total of 10). For the purpose of being
   able to more accurately reflect the status of items in a set, the set will be itemized on the
   MIL. The first line will identify the set and account for the pouch/case/container/etc. of the
   set. Followed by an itemized breakdown of the set as per example:

Table 1. MIL.
 Nomenclature                                                       Location        QTY
 Allen wrench set- (9 Allen wrenches + container = 10 total)        DR1 001              1
 **this accounts for main item**
 ¼ Allen wrench                                                     DR1 001A             1
 ½ Allen wrench                                                     DR1 001B             1
 And so on…                                                                              1
                      (Note: counted as one on MIL, but each one listed)

      5.1.1. Locations of tools will be listed by drawer/section on the MIL
   5.2. Procedures for transferring of CTK at the job site both parties will inventory the
   CTK together and after agreeing to its content, the individual who receives the CTK assumes
   custodial responsibility by signing the AFRC Form 177 which is maintained in each CTK.
   5.3. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) issued to an individual (e.g. ear defenders,
   headsets, safety glasses, face shields, and respirators) can be long term issued through
   TCMax or assigned to a shadow board. Shadow board items will be marked with as a
   minimum, EID designator. When issued long term to an individual, they may be maintained
   in personal lockers or tool rooms. As a minimum, these items will be marked with a TCMax
   number which can be traced back to an individual. Individuals are responsible for control of
   their personal protective equipment.
   5.4. Rags will be controlled in TCMax they will be stored in a secure location and issued out
   in TCMax for positive control. See Maintenance Operations Instruction (MOI) 21-37 for Rag
   Control procedures.
   5.5. Procedures for lost/missing tools will be in accordance with AFI21-101_AFRCSUP_I,
   and AWI 21-105, Impoundment Procedures.
   5.6. CTK/Vehicle keys will be located in a designated area of the owning work center.
4                                                          910AWI21-109 4 FEBRUARY 2013


       5.6.1. Vehicle keys will be controlled and issued through TCMax using the assigned 9 -
       digit EID number.
       5.6.2. CTK keys will be marked with the applicable CTK number and listed on the MIL
       with appropriate QTY. If the key is being stored separately from CTK for security then
       the location of the key needs to be annotated on the MIL in the comments section. (e.g.
       Key stored in key box when CTK is not in use for security) Some CTK’s have multiple
       keys for separate compartments. Total number of keys is identified in the nomenclature
       block with the ring and id tag.
       5.6.3. If the Tool Storage Facility/Tool Room is unable to be secured or does not meet
       the requirements as outlined IAW AFI21-101_AFRCSUP_I. CTK keys will be secured
       separately from CTK.
       5.6.4. If a key box or any other means of securing keys is used, an inventory is required
       to account for all keys being stored for security.
    5.7. Only designated CTK custodians, their alternate or a flight chief will procure tools and
    replacement items for the CTK.
    5.8. Depot teams, factory representatives and contract field teams will be able to show full
    accountability of tools per the workload agreement/contract.
    5.9. Locally manufactured or developed tools/equipment will be requested by the custodian
    or shop supervisor per 910 MOI 21-25, Local Manufacture Operating Instruction, and after
    manufactured, will be marked with the appropriate EID number and added to the MIL.
    Further, these tools / equipment will be inspected/ reviewed for applicability and
    serviceability i.e.(go/no-go gauge) during CTK’s annual inspection. During biennial review
    of local man tool(s), if the tool/equipment is deemed applicable and configuration current,
    consider submitting an AFTO Form 22 for potential inclusion into technical data AF-wide.
    5.10. Special Purpose CTKs are defined as ―small individually issued tool kits that because
    of the nature of contents or type of container could preclude shadowing or silhouetting (e.g.,
    launch kits, recovery kits, cartridge cleaning kits, oxygen servicing kits, etc).‖
       5.10.1. The CDDAR equipment trailer will be clearly marked with assigned EID number
       on the outside of trailer. Equipment contained in trailer that cannot be silhouetted /
       shadowed will be labeled with nomenclature and quantity at its storage location. Positive
       control is required in the form of physical inventories at the start and stop of a procedure
       or at a minimum daily when in use. All Hand-tools on the trailer fall under the CTK
       program guidelines and will be etched with appropriate CTK EID number. Operating
       Stock/materials need a master listing or other type of positive control.
    5.11. In a one-person shop, the same individual may inventory non-dispatchable CTK at the
    beginning and end of each shift. Dispatchable CTK’s will be signed out using TC Max. In the
    event there is no other person available to sign the tool box / tools back in using TC Max,
    personnel will utilize the AFRC form 177 ensuring that all information is filled in to include
    writing TC Max in the signed out block. The next day / shift, a different person will review
    the tools/ toolbox for inventory, ensure AFRC form 177 was completed and then sign tools/
    toolbox back into inventory using TC Max.
