SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This version consoli-
dates and supersedes FAIRCHILDAFBI10-126, Resource Augmentation Duty (READY),14 January 2003.


1. Execution.
   1.1. Concept of Operations. An identified and trained pool of READY augmentees will be available
   to allocate to previously approved and validated functional areas at the direction of the 92d Air Refu-
   eling Wing Commander (92 ARW/CC). The 92d Air Refueling Wing Vice Commander (92 ARW/
   CV) administers the program and provides operational direction. Groups provide trained personnel to
2                                                           FAIRCHILDAFBI10-126 4 APRIL 2008


    fulfill assigned READY commitments when activated by the 92 ARW/CV. Requirement owners pro-
    vide periodic training courses to enable Groups to satisfy their READY commitments. Requirement
    owners request activation of READY augmentees through 92 ARW/CV, who validates the require-
    ment and activates the READY augmentees. Upon activation of a validated READY requirement,
    Group points of contact provide required manpower to the requirement owners.

2. Definitions and Assumptions.
    2.1. READY Augmentee: A member trained to perform an additional function outside of normal duty
    areas. Augmentees are assigned to support validated READY tasks, as required.
    2.2. READY Requirement: A validated Wing-level task that can be performed by a member holding
    any Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) after undergoing appropriate training and equipping. Tasks
    requiring specific AFSCs and detailed training and or experience should not be validated as READY
    requirements.
    2.3. Requirement Owner: The functional agency point of contact (POC) responsible for mission
    accomplishment of the READY requirement. Requirement owners will exercise operational supervi-
    sion over augmentees when activated, are responsible for providing periodic training opportunities,
    and will validate augmentees’ certification in any required skills. Requirement owners will keep a
    database to track names of trained personnel.
    2.4. Assigned Manpower: For the purpose of READY tasking calculations, only Technical Sergeants
    and below are considered in a unit’s assigned manpower pool.
    2.5. Exempt Manpower: Those assigned members who cannot be used as READY augmentees.
    Members may be considered exempt for one of three reasons: 1) Air Force Instruction or Air Mobility
    Command Instruction expressed prohibition against use for READY duties; 2) Medical profile or pro-
    hibition against performing specific duty, or; 3) deemed as mission essential by functional owner and
    validated by READY Board.
    2.6. Available Manpower: Defined as the assigned manpower, minus the exempt manpower, for each
    Squadron or Group.
    2.7. READY Tax: Defined as the overall percentage charged to each Group to meet the total number
    of validated Wing-level READY requirements. The READY tax is calculated by dividing the total
    number of personnel needed to support all validated READY requirements by the total available
    Wing-level manpower pool. [(READY requirements) / (Wing Available) = READY Tax]
    2.8. Group-Level READY Task: Will be defined by multiplying the Wing-level READY Tax by the
    available manpower pool for each Group. [(READY Tax) x (Group Available) = Group Task]
    2.9. READY Task Matrix: The READY Task Matrix is a refined break out of the Group responsibil-
    ities toward each individual validated READY requirement. This matrix allows Group POCs to assign
    specific READY tasks to their respective Squadrons.
    2.10. Standing READY Requirement: A standing READY requirement is approved for activation at
    any time by the 92 ARW/CV (Table A3.1.). A standing READY requirement grants the requirement
    owner permission to call up assigned augmentees without having to go through a separate activation
    approval for each use and should be granted to owner’s who have short duration recurring require-
    ments. The 92 ARW/CV will limit the number of standing READY requirements to a minimum to
    ensure manpower activations are not abused.
FAIRCHILDAFBI10-126 4 APRIL 2008                                                                     3


3. Responsibilities.
   3.1. 92 ARW/CV: Will maintain operational control over the base READY program. These duties
   will include chairing the READY Review Board to validate READY Requirements and Group-level
   READY Taxes based on manpower availability. The 92 ARW/CV will act as the approval authority
   for activating any READY forces, review requests from requirement owners, coordinate those
   requests with all Groups, and validate standing READY requirements that do not require approval for
   each use.
   3.2. 92 ARW Groups and Wing Staff: Group Commanders and the Director of Staff serve, in addition
   to 92 ARW/CV, as voting members of the READY Review Board. They are responsible for maintain-
   ing trained and equipped READY augmentees available to respond to tasks assigned in Table A2.1.
   (Attachment 2). Trained members must be available to respond to READY tasks at all times. To sat-
   isfy this requirement, Groups will make personnel available for scheduled training provided by
   Requirement Owners, and should train a sufficient number of augmentees to cover their assigned
   tasks. For Security Forces augmentees, units must train a primary and an alternate for each require-
   ment. This extra pool of trained personnel will help account for members who may be deployed, sick,
   on temporary duty, or otherwise unable to perform assigned READY duties. Groups have the ultimate
   responsibility for providing READY augmentees as required. Each Group will appoint a POC who
   can be contacted to activate required augmentees after approval is granted by the 92 ARW/CV. Group
   POCs are listed in Table A3.1. (Attachment 3).
   3.3. Requirement Owners: Requirement owners are responsible for providing training to potential
   augmentees as required. POCs should be available to schedule training and respond to inquiries as
   required. Requirement owners must also provide any specialized equipment that may be required to
   perform the READY task. Validated requirements with POCs are listed in Table A4.1. (Attachment
   4). Requirement owners must formally request activation of READY augmentees through their Group
   commander and the 92 ARW/CV using the format letter located at Attachment 5. Standing approval
   to use READY augmentees can also be requested and granted for some functions (Table A4.1., Note
   1) using Attachment 5 as well. Requirement owners will maintain a database documenting the names
   and units of trained augmentees.
   3.4. 92 Mission Support Squadron Commander (92 MSS/CC) will act as the administrative authority
   for the READY program and the executive director (non-voting) for the READY Review Boards.
   This responsibility will include scheduling and running the READY Review Board, maintaining and
   generating current data on available manpower, maintaining and generating the current list of vali-
   dated requirements, and maintaining the READY Task Matrix. 92 MSS/CC will provide any required
   READY Tax adjustments based on reduced or increased numbers of requested augmentees in
   response to a previously unaccounted for world condition. 92 MSS/CC will appoint a Wing READY
   POC who will maintain the listing of assigned READY tasks and ensure Requirement Owners main-
   tain a list of names and units of trained augmentees.
   3.5. 92 ARW Squadrons and Wing Staff Agencies: Units who are assigned READY tasks by their
   Groups will ensure that all trained personnel are coded as READY augmentees in Personnen Concept
   III (PC-III), see Table A6.1. (Attachment 6) by their Commander Support Staffs. Units with READY
   augmentees who PCS/PCA should use the PC-III identifier to ensure a new augmentee is trained and
   equipped as a replacement.

    3.6. Associate Units: The 336th Training Group may provide personnel for augmentee duty on an
    as-available basis. Provided personnel will be used to offset the READY tasks levied against 92 ARW
    groups. READY requirements filled by associate units will be limited to those that require little or no
    advance training (just in time training). As soon as READY requirements become known, 92 MSS/
    CC will contact 336 TRG/CD to determine the level of support available from 336 TRG. All remain-
    ing associate units may be approached to provide personnel for augmentee duty by 92 ARW/CV; how-
    ever no standing requirement to support is established by this instruction.

4. Activation Procedures.
    4.1. Upon validation of a READY Requirement, 92 ARW/CV will direct activation through the most
    expeditious means available. At a minimum, 92 MSS/CC must be notified to initiate activation proce-
    dures with Group POCs.
    4.2. If the Installation Control Center (ICC) is active, an ICC Directive will be released with details
    of the directed READY activation. Units will notify applicable READY augmentees to prepare for
    activation and to await further instruction from the Group READY POC.
    4.3. 92 MSS/CC will immediately notify the Wing READY POC, who will in turn notify Group
    READY POCs. The Wing READY POC will coordinate with Requirement Owners to establish
    reporting procedures and provide that information to Group POCs. If less than the full READY
    Requirement is activated, each Groups contribution will be prorated equal to their percentage of the
    full READY Requirement as indicated in the READY Task Matrix.
    4.4. Group READY POCs will notify individual units of the activated READY Requirement, includ-
    ing how many augmentees the unit is to provide and reporting instructions. Group POCs will provide
    hourly updates to the Wing READY POC until the Group’s READY Requirement has been fully met.
    4.5. Requirement Owners will provide hourly updates to the Wing READY POC until the READY
    Requirement has been fully met.
    4.6. 92 MSS/CC will report the status of all activated READY Requirements to 92 ARW/CV through
    appropriate means until the requirement has been fully met.

Note 1: Security Forces requires each unit to provide a primary and an alternate.
Note 2: These positions are considered standing READY requirements. The requirement owner may
immediately call augmentees to fill these positions without prior approval from 92 ARW/CV.
Note 3: These positions, though validated READY requirements, will not be tasked to individual units.
These known requirements, and others when identified, will be tasked directly by 92 ARW/CV as and
when required as part of the READY program.

A5.1. The following written documentation (i.e., e-mail or letter) should be used by requirement owners
to request activation of READY augmentees. Requirement owners should also use this form to request
permanent authority to call up augmentees as required without having to go through 92 ARW/CV each
time. Once granted permanent authority, the requirement owner can contact Group POCs directly to acti-
vate required augmentees.

                              PC-III READY ASSIGNMENT CODES

A6.1. The following codes should be used to annotate trained READY augmentees in PC-III. Each
Squadron will be responsible for upkeep and maintenance of their READY personnel in PC-III. At such
time as PC-III is no longer being utilized by the Air Force, 92 MSS/CC will determine appropriate codes
and procedures to track READY augmentee training in Military Personnel Data System (MILPDS) and/
or the Defense Integrated Military Human Resource System (DIMHRS).
