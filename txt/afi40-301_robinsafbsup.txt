           PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND ADMINISTRATION OVERVIEW

2.1. AF FAP. The FAP develops, implements, and evaluates programs and policies to prevent
and treat family maltreatment. The FAP provides expert training and consultation services to its
key customers, including Airmen and their families, AF leaders, and other AF helping agencies.
AF FAP collects, maintains, analyzes, and reports data on family maltreatment. In concert with
installation and community agencies, the AF FAP provides a continuum of services designed to
build community health and resilience by reducing family maltreatment. The AF FAP promotes
family, community, and mission readiness.
   2.1.1. Providing services to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).
       2.1.1.1. This instruction applies to all military and civilian AF personnel and their
       dependents entitled to receive medical care in a MTF as specified in AFI 44-115;
       including reservists and their families. Collaboration between FAP staff and reserve
       personnel is highly encouraged and may include consultation, one-time emergency
       evaluations, referrals, prevention, and education. Any duty to warn requirements must
       result in a timely referral to the appropriate non-military authority.
       2.1.1.2. The Air Force Reserve Command does not maintain a separate reserve FAP.
       Efforts to minimize family maltreatment and its effect on mission readiness to reserve
       forces are limited to preventive education, identification, emergency intervention, and
       referrals, when indicated. Allegations of family maltreatment involving reserve airmen
       and/or their families (not eligible for care in a MTF) are routinely managed by civilian
       agencies in conjunction with civilian law enforcement organizations.
2.2. FAP Components. The FAP is comprised of three principal components: Prevention
(Prevention/Outreach Program, NPSP, and FAST), Maltreatment Intervention, and Research and
Evaluation.
   2.2.1. The Prevention/Outreach Program is the focal point for family maltreatment education
   and training to leaders, agencies, and the community. The program includes secondary
   prevention programs for at-risk families. The FAOMs are masters level social workers,
   prevention team leaders, and community liaisons. They coordinate FAP marketing,
   community outreach, and collaboration services. The FAOM is the FAP representative to the
   IDS.
   2.2.2. The installation FAP prevention team collaborates with key community leaders, the
   IDS, and other helping agencies to provide services that enhance the resilience of AF
   communities and reduce the incidence of family maltreatment. FAP prevention services
   include Prevention/Outreach, the NPSP, and FAST. FAP Prevention/Outreach coordinates
   and implements primary and secondary prevention services that include education and
   psychosocial skills training, advocacy, collaboration, community intervention, referral to
   community resources, and marketing.
   2.2.3. The NPSP is a secondary prevention program that uses an intensive, voluntary home
   visitation model to provide education and supportive services to families with children from
   birth to three years of age, including the prenatal period. Services are provided primarily by
AFI40-301_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 5 JUNE 2014                                                        19


   Registered Nurses (RNs), augmented by social workers. NPSP services capitalize on
   parents’ strengths and are provided in a manner sensitive to cultural differences.
   Involvement of both parents in NPSP services is promoted, when applicable.
      2.2.3.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) 78th Medical Group TOPA Flight will provide the New
      Parents Support Program (NPSP) a monthly listing of all obstetric patients referred off
      base to ensure NPSP is able to offer services. 78th Medical Group Force Health will
      refer all expectant active duty personnel to the NPSP Passport to Parenthood class for
      information about specialized base and community services.
   2.2.4. Family Advocacy Strength-based Therapy (FAST) offers brief intervention and
   support to couples and families at risk of family maltreatment who do not meet eligibility
   criteria for NPSP.
   2.2.5. Maltreatment Intervention: Provides comprehensive family assessment, intervention,
   and case management to all eligible beneficiaries where there is an alleged incident(s) of
   family maltreatment. FAP providers collaborate with other medical and mental health
   professionals, community service providers, and the various FAP management teams to
   provide optimal care and service coordination to their clients.
      2.2.5.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Ensures a maltreatment record is opened for suspected
      domestic violence or domestic abuse involving unmarried intimate partners, where at
      least one partner or former partner is active duty military.
      2.2.5.2. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Family Advocacy Program staff will refer all eligible
      adult victims to the Domestic Abuse Victim Advocate (DAVA). The DAVA will ensure
      intensive and individualized safety planning is provided for all victims of domestic
      abuse/violence, including retirees. The DAVA will also provide a full range of advocacy
      services including, assistance with obtaining orders of protection, escort service to
      medical appointments, guidance on restricted reporting for domestic violence/domestic
      abuse liaison to commanding officers, and education about domestic violence and abuse.
      DAVA services are available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
   2.2.6. Research and Evaluation: FAP sponsors targeted and system-wide research and
   evaluation of prevention and intervention services. Research projects are conducted through
   collaborative partnerships with military and civilian researchers who understand the unique
   needs of military families. Projects are selected based on their potential to inform and
   improve FAP programs and practices. The Central Registry staff maintains a database on
   family maltreatment cases. Statistical reports are generated from Central Registry data to
   assess trends, respond to OSD, DoD, AF senior leaders, and media queries and provide
   opportunities for process outcome and compliance improvement. A significant proportion of
   FAP research is conducted for the purpose of program evaluation, accountability, and quality
   assurance.
2.3. Additional Administrative Elements. To ensure program effectiveness, the following key
features will exist as a part of each installation FAP:
   2.3.1. A FAP Installation Instruction (Supplement to AFI 40-301) and MTF operating
   instructions (OIs) for implementation of the FAP are required. This guidance will address
   local policies and unique circumstances impacting FAP implementation. All first responder
   agencies and medical personnel should coordinate on these documents, which should

       conducting clinical assessment of the alleged domestic abuser, as required by DoDI
       6400.06, August 21, 2007, paragraph 6.6.4.
       4.4.4.3. (Added-ROBINSAFB) When a HRVRT has been activated and the case is
       being closed unresolved with risk assessment of moderate or higher for the victim, the
       offender, or both, the HRVRT will be reactivated.
4.5. Intervention.
   4.5.1. Each allegation of family maltreatment will receive an immediate risk assessment
   followed by individual psychosocial assessments with each family member. If the incident
   meets criteria for maltreatment, an intervention plan will be developed with the family.
   Regardless of incident status, referrals will be made to address any needs identified in the
   assessment process.
   4.5.2. When domestic abuse or child maltreatment occurs between an AD member and an
   unmarried intimate partner who is not a military beneficiary; a FAP provider will assess the
30                                             AFI40-301_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 5 JUNE 2014

  4.5.3. Information and referral to the Victim/Witness Assistance Program (VWAP) is
  provided to victims IAW Chapter 7, AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice, and
  local JA policy.
  4.5.4. FAP staff refer adult victims to DAVA services. These services may be in partnership
  with civilian providers. If the victim is not an eligible beneficiary, the victim is assessed by
  the FAP provider and then referred to local resources.
  4.5.5. Law enforcement, emergency personnel, and squadron/unit commanders are
  responsible for managing acute situations where there is risk to the safety of a military
  member or family member. FAP staff will not accompany command or emergency
  personnel to unsecured home environments in emergent situations.

  service and/or contract), will not provide clinical intervention to sexual offenders to modify
  deviant sexual arousal patterns. These clients will be referred for such clinical intervention
  to specialists in the community. FAP and MTF personnel may provide other services to sex
  offenders as long as services do not focus on deviant arousal patterns.
  4.5.11. Child and Domestic Abuse Fatality Review.
     4.5.11.1. The AF Child and Domestic Abuse Fatality Review Team will convene
     annually, at minimum, to review fatalities and develop the annual report for submission
     to ODUSD (P&R/MC&FP) IAW DoDI 6400.06.
     4.5.11.2. Fatality reviews will be conducted annually on homicides resulting from family
     maltreatment and family maltreatment related suicides. AF FAP is responsible for
     coordinating the Air Force Multidisciplinary Fatality Review Team.
     4.5.11.3. The AF Multidisciplinary Fatality Review Team will be chaired by the Chief,
     AF FAP or designee and will include senior representatives from, Air Force Personnel
     Center, AF Security Forces, AF Chief of Chaplains, Military Victim Advocate, Office of

AFI40-301_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 5 JUNE 2014                                                           31


4.6. Domestic Abuse Victim Advocates (DAVAs).
   4.6.1. DAVAs should be available to AF victims of domestic abuse 24/hrs a day 7 days a
   week. Where installation FAP resources cannot sustain a DAVA, the FAO will ensure
   domestic abuse advocate services are provided through MOU(s) with local civilian domestic
   abuse advocate services.
   4.6.2. During non-duty hours, AF DAVA services will be accessed through the Mental
   Health provider on call.
   4.6.3. AF DAVAs will provide supportive services to victims as described in DoD guidance
   and the AF FAP standards.
4.7. Domestic Abuse Reporting Options. Adult victims of domestic abuse have two reporting
options: unrestricted reporting and Restricted Reporting (RR). Regardless of whether the victim
elects restricted or unrestricted reporting, confidentiality of medical information will be
maintained IAW the HIPAA.
   4.7.1. Unrestricted Reporting for Domestic Abuse. Unrestricted reporting is a process
   allowing a victim of domestic abuse to report an incident using chain of command, law
   enforcement or AFOSI Detachment, and Family Advocacy for clinical intervention. Victims
   of domestic abuse who choose to pursue an official command or criminal investigation of an
   incident should use these reporting channels. Upon notification of a reported domestic abuse
   incident, DAVA (where available) and FAP clinical services will be offered to the victim. At
   the victim’s request, the medical provider, in coordination with criminal investigators, will
   conduct a forensic medical examination. Details regarding the incident will be limited to
   only those personnel who have a legitimate need to know.
   4.7.2. Restricted Reporting (RR) for Domestic Abuse.
       4.7.2.1. RR is a process allowing an adult victim of domestic abuse, who is eligible to
       receive military medical treatment (including civilians and contractors who are eligible to
       receive military healthcare outside the CONUS on a reimbursable basis) the option of
       reporting an incident of domestic abuse to specified individuals for the purpose of
       receiving medical care, supportive services, and/or advocacy and information without
       initiating the investigative process or notification to the victim’s or alleged offender’s
       CC.
          4.7.2.1.1. When sexual assault occurs between spouses or unmarried intimates it is
          domestic violence and will be managed by FAP.
          4.7.2.1.2. Once FAP assumes case management of domestic abuse sexual assault
          cases, no information about the case is shared with the SARC without the client’s
          consent.
       4.7.2.2. When an adult victim elects RR, and discloses an abuse allegation to a DAVA,
       or healthcare provider (including FAP staff), the domestic abuse allegation may not be
       disclosed to command or civilian or military investigative or law enforcement agencies
       except as provided in the exceptions to this RR policy or mandated by state law.
       4.7.2.3. Victims who make a domestic abuse RR inquiry to Military One Source, NPSP
       staff, or the SARC will be referred to a FAP provider, who will assist the victim with the
       reporting process.
32                                            AFI40-301_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 5 JUNE 2014


     4.7.2.4. If the victim discloses a domestic abuse allegation in the presence of the alleged
     offender, the RR option does not apply.
     4.7.2.5. For purposes of command responsibility and in the interest of gathering accurate
     data, information concerning RRs of domestic abuse, without personal identifiers, will be
     reported by the FAO at the next FAC meeting. This will inform installation leadership as
     to the number and type of domestic abuse incidents within the command and enhance the
     CC’s ability to provide a safe environment. If the installation leadership wants to be
     notified of DA RRs sooner than the next FAC, the FAO will supply the required
     information as requested.
     4.7.2.6. The medical provider will initiate appropriate care and treatment and will report
     the domestic abuse only to a DAVA or FAP. At the victim’s request, the medical
     provider will conduct/arrange any forensic medical examination deemed appropriate.
     The forensic component includes gathering information from the victim for the medical
     forensic history, an examination, documentation of biological and physical findings,
     collection of evidence from the victim, and follow-up, as needed, to document additional
     evidence. The medical provider will transfer the forensic evidence, via proper evidence
     chain of custody procedures, to an AFOSI Detachment agent using a control number in
     lieu of personal identifying information.
        4.7.2.6.1. All RRs that have physical evidence associated with them will be assigned
        a Restricted Report Control Number (RRCN) by a FAP provider. The RRCN will be
        developed using a two-digit year, two-digit month, the first four letters of the
        installation name, a three-digit numerical sequence, and followed by “R-FAP.” For
        example, “0709RAND001R FAP” represents the incidence occurred in 2007, during
        September, at Randolph AFB, is the first report of this sequence, and is a restricted
        report.
        4.7.2.6.2. DAVAs or FAP providers have no responsibility for the collection of
        physical evidence when a restricted report has been made. DAVAs or FAP providers
        will not collect or receive physical evidence of domestic violence from a victim.
        4.7.2.6.3. The local AFOSI detachment is responsible for taking custody of the
        physical evidence from Healthcare Personnel and will log, store and preserve the
        evidence IAW AFOSI procedures.
        4.7.2.6.4. If prior to the one-year anniversary date a victim changes the reporting
        preference to an unrestricted report, the FAP shall notify the AFOSI, who shall then
        process the physical evidence IAW AFOSI procedures.
        4.7.2.6.5. FAP will notify the victim 30 days prior to the expiration of the one-year
        evidence storage period. The FAP will appropriately document the efforts to obtain a
        decision from the victim or efforts to locate the victim. The FAP is authorized to
        complete any documentation required from AFOSI for the destruction of evidence on
        behalf of the victim. The evidence will be destroyed at the one-year anniversary date
        unless:
            4.7.2.6.5.1. The victim decides to make an unrestricted report.
            4.7.2.6.5.2. The victim does not request the return of any personal effects or
AFI40-301_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 5 JUNE 2014                                                        33


             clothing maintained as part of the collection of evidence.
             4.7.2.6.5.3. The victim does not advise the FAP of his or her decision after being
             notified of the upcoming one-year anniversary.
             4.7.2.6.5.4. The victim cannot be located.
     4.7.2.7. If the DAVA has the first contact with the victim, he/she will notify the FAO as
     soon as possible. The DAVA will provide information about victim reporting options
     and available VA services.
     4.7.2.8. The victim will acknowledge in writing his/her understanding that RR will limit
     the government’s ability to prosecute the alleged offender in a domestic abuse incident by
     signing the USAF Family Advocacy Victim Reporting Preference Statement
     (Attachment 5) after all available reporting options, exceptions and limitations are
     explained to the victim by the FAP staff member.
     4.7.2.9. Documentation of a RR is maintained in a Family Advocacy Restricted Report
     Maltreatment Record. If the Victim Reporting Preference Statement is completed by
     someone other than a FAP provider, a copy will be submitted to FAP for the Family
     Advocacy Restricted Report Maltreatment Record. The victim will receive a FAP intake
     assessment and will be advised of clinical and support services available on and off the
     installation.
     4.7.2.10. The AF RR policy is in addition to the current protections afforded privileged
     communications under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and does not
     alter or affect those protections.
  4.7.3. Exceptions to Confidentiality, RR, and Limitations on Use:
     4.7.3.1. In cases in which a victim elects RR, the prohibition on disclosing covered
     communications to the following persons or entities will be suspended when disclosure
     would be for the following reasons:
         4.7.3.1.1. Named individuals when disclosure is authorized by the victim in writing.
         4.7.3.1.2. Command officials or law enforcement when necessary to prevent or
         lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of the victim or another
         person.
     4.7.3.2. A present or past risk for danger does not necessarily equate to a serious and
     imminent threat in a case. FAP must use the totality of the facts and apply professional
     judgment as a result. In assessing the risk of imminent harm to the victim, and the
     potential for escalation of violence the FAP clinician and /or DAVA should weigh the
     existence and frequency of the following risk factors:
         4.7.3.2.1. Victimization patterns have increased in severity or frequency.
         4.7.3.2.2. Alleged offender threatened or attempts to kill the victim or his/her
         children.
         4.7.3.2.3. Alleged offender threatened or attempted suicide.
         4.7.3.2.4. Alleged offender strangled the victim.

        4.7.3.2.5. Alleged offender used a weapon or threatened to use a weapon against the
        victim.
        4.7.3.2.6. Victim sustained serious injury during the abusive incidents.
        4.7.3.2.7. Police had prior contact with the alleged offender regarding domestic
        abuse.
        4.7.3.2.8. Victim has a restraining order or order of protection against the alleged
        offender.
        4.7.3.2.9. Victim is estranged, separated, or attempting to separate from the alleged
        offender.
        4.7.3.2.10. Alleged offender stalked the victim.
        4.7.3.2.11. Alleged offender exhibits obsessive behavior, extreme jealousy, or
        extreme dominance.
        4.7.3.2.12. Alleged offender abuses alcohol or drugs.
        4.7.3.2.13. Alleged offender forced sex on the victim.
        4.7.3.2.14. Alleged offender has abused victim during current pregnancy.
        4.7.3.2.15. Victim expresses fear of imminent serious harm or death.
        4.7.3.2.16. Alleged offender has active psychosis and/or mania.
        4.7.3.2.17. Alleged offender use of psychoactive drugs, such as amphetamines or
        cocaine.
     4.7.3.3. FAP and any other agencies authorized by law to receive reports of child abuse
     or neglect when, as a result of the victim’s disclosure, the DAVA or FAP has a
     reasonable belief that child abuse has also occurred. However, disclosure will be limited
     only to information related to the child abuse.
     4.7.3.4. Disability Retirement Boards and officials when disclosure by a healthcare
     provider is required for fitness for duty for disability retirement determinations, limited to
     only that information necessary to process the disability retirement determination.
     4.7.3.5. Supervisors of the DAVA, FAP, or medical provider when disclosure is required
     for the purposes of supervision of direct victim treatment or services.
     4.7.3.6. Military or civilian courts of competent jurisdiction when a military, federal, or
     state judge issues a subpoena or order for the covered communications to be presented to
     the court or to other officials or entities, when the judge orders such disclosure.
     4.7.3.7. To other officials or entities when required by federal or state statute or
     applicable U. S. international agreement.
     4.7.3.8. Healthcare providers may also convey to the victim’s CC, if applicable,
     information on any possible adverse duty impact related to an AD victim’s medical
     condition and prognosis. Such circumstances, however, do not otherwise warrant an
     exception to policy and therefore, the specific details of the domestic abuse incident will
     still be treated as covered communication and may not be disclosed.
AFI40-301_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 5 JUNE 2014                                                           35


       4.7.3.9. If the DAVA or FAP provider believes that disclosure is required, pursuant to
       one of the exceptions, the DAVA or FAP provider shall first consult with his or her
       supervisor and JA prior to disclosure. When there is uncertainty or disagreement on
       whether an exception applies, the matter will be referred to the installation CC for
       resolution.
NOTE: When the exception to RR relates to an imminent risk of harm to a victim or other, the
FAP will act to ensure the safety of those involved, disclosing the minimal amount of
information necessary to allow for an informed coordinated response to the perceived threat, will
document the rationale for and extent of the disclosure and will consult with his/her supervisor
and JA at the earliest opportunity.
       4.7.3.10. The DAVA or FAP provider must make every reasonable effort to provide the
       affected victim advance notice of the intention to disclose a covered communication with
       a description of the information to be disclosed, the basis for disclosure, and the
       individual, group, or agency to which it will be disclosed. The disclosure will be limited
       to information necessary to satisfy the purpose of the disclosure in the event the
       disclosure is made under the authority of one of the stated exceptions. Further disclosure
       will not be made unless the domestic abuse victim authorizes the disclosure in writing.
       4.7.3.11. In the event that information about a domestic abuse incident is disclosed to the
       CC or FAP from a source independent of the RR avenues, law enforcement or AFOSI
       Detachment shall also be notified. FAP shall intervene with the family and conduct
       assessments and provide treatment. Additionally, a victim’s disclosure of his or her
       domestic abuse to persons other than those covered by this policy may result in an
       investigation of the allegations by law enforcement and clinical intervention from FAP.
       Consistent with current policy, CCs acquiring information under these circumstances
       about a domestic abuse incident shall immediately notify law enforcement and FAP.

                               DISPOSITION OF PERSONNEL

5.1. Special Duty. FAP involvement alone does not require any duty restriction. For
information about how to assign personnel receiving FAP assistance while performing duties
requiring either the Sensitive Duty Programs, security clearance, access to classified information,
or unescorted entry into restricted areas refer to DoDR5210.42_AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear
Weapons Personnel Reliability Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program
Management.
5.2. Review of Duty Assignment. CCs must review the duty assignment status of all military
members whose current duties may make it difficult for them to receive Family Advocacy
intervention. Military members considered fit for duty may continue in their primary or control
Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) while involved in FAP intervention, unless precluded under
AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel. If precluded, the CC may assign members under
their secondary or tertiary AFSC during the FAP intervention process.
5.3. Promotion and Retention of Personnel. A member's involvement in the FAP will not be
the sole basis for denying or withholding promotion, retention, or special duty assignments.
   5.3.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Clinician shall provide prognosis for abuser to Commander

  USAF FAMILY ADVOCACY VICTIM REPORTING PREFERENCE STATEMENT

PRIVACY ACT STATEMENT

AUTHORITY: Section 301 of Title 5 U.S.C. and Chapter 55 of Title 10 U.S.C.

PRINCIPAL PURPOSE(S): Information on this form will be used to document elements of the
abuse response and/or reporting process and comply will the procedures set up to effectively
manage abuse incidents.

ROUTINE USE(S): None

DISCLOSURE: Completion of this form is voluntary; however, failure to complete this form
with the information requested impedes the effective management of care, safety planning, and
support required by the procedures of domestic abuse prevention and response programs.

1. Reporting process and options discussed with the Domestic Abuse Victim Advocate (DAVA)
or Family Advocacy Provider:

I, ____________________________________, had the opportunity to talk with a DAVA or
Family Advocacy Provider before selecting a reporting option.

2. The following applies to Unrestricted Reporting:

I understand that law enforcement, my or the offender’s chain of command will be notified of
my report that I am a victim of domestic abuse and a law enforcement investigation will occur. I
understand that I can receive medical treatment, advocacy services, support, and counseling. I
also understand that I can request to be separated from the offender, that a military protective
order can be issued to enforce that separation, and that I can also pursue a civilian order of
protection through the local courts.

       Initial                             Date

3. The following applies to Restricted Reporting:

a. I understand that I can confidentially receive medical treatment, advocacy services, support,
and counseling. Law enforcement and command will NOT be notified. My report will NOT
initiate an investigation; therefore, no action will be taken against the offender as the result of my
report.

b. I understand that there are exceptions to “Restricted Reporting” (see exceptions in paragraph
4). If an exception applies, limited details of my allegation may be revealed to satisfy the
exception. Further disclosure will not be made unless I authorize the disclosure in writing.
AFI40-301_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 5 JUNE 2014                                                               55


c. I understand that if I do not choose a reporting option at this time, the commander (or
designated persons within the chain of command) and law enforcement will be notified.

d. I understand that state laws, local laws or international agreements may limit some or all of
the restricted reporting protections explained to me. In (state/country)
_____________________, medical authorities must report the abuse to_______________ (if
applicable).

e. I understand that the DAVA or Family Advocacy Provider will provide aggregate and non-
identifying information to command officials. This information will give commanders a clearer
picture as to the number and type of domestic abuse incidents within their command, and
enhance the commanders’ ability to provide an environment that is safe and contributes to the
well-being and mission-readiness of all.

f.       I understand that if I make a “Restricted Report”, after 1 year any evidence collected
will be destroyed and no longer available for any future investigation or prosecution efforts.

g. I understand that if I talk about my abuse to anyone other than the Health Care Provider
(HCP), DAVA, or Family Advocacy Provider, it may be reported to command and law
enforcement which could lead to an investigation.

h. I understand that Restricted Reporting does not extend to offenders who seek services.

i. I understand that the Family Advocacy Provider, DAVA, or HCP, and their supervisors, may
discuss the details of my case to ensure effective delivery of services when receiving
supervision.

j. I understand that I may change my mind and report the abuse at a later time as an
“Unrestricted Report”, law enforcement and command will be notified. I also understand
delayed reporting may limit the ability to prosecute the alleged offender. If the case goes to a
judicial proceeding, my DAVA and others providing care may be called to testify about any
information I disclosed.

       Initial                            Date

4. EXCEPTIONS to Restricted Reporting:

a. Named individuals when disclosure is authorized by the victim in writing.

b. Command officials or law enforcement when necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and
imminent threat to the health or safety of the victim or another person.

c. FAP and any other agencies authorized by law to receive reports of child abuse or neglect
when, as a result of the victim’s disclosure, the DAVA or HCP has a reasonable belief that child

abuse has also occurred. However, disclosure will be limited only to information related to the
child abuse.

d. Disability Retirement Boards and officials when disclosure by a HCP is required for fitness
for duty for disability retirement determinations, limited to only that information which is
necessary to process the disability retirement determination.

e. Supervisors of the DAVA or HCP when disclosure is required for the supervision of direct
victim treatment or services.

f. Military or civilian courts of competent jurisdiction when a Military, Federal, or State judge
issues a subpoena for the covered communications to be presented to the court or to other
officials or entities when the judge orders such disclosure; or to other officials or entities when
required by Federal or State statute or applicable U. S. international agreement.

5. Choose a reporting option:

_________ Unrestricted Report: I elect unrestricted reporting and have decided to report that I
am a victim of domestic abuse to law enforcement, command, or other military authorities for
investigation of the incident.

_________ Restricted Report: I elect restricted reporting and have decided to confidentially
report that I am a victim of domestic abuse. Command will NOT be provided with information
about my identity. Law enforcement or other military authorities will NOT be notified unless
one of the exceptions above applies. I understand the information I provide will not start an
investigation or be used to punish the alleged offender with respect to this report. I further
understand that choosing a restricted report will limit the government’s ability to
prosecute the alleged offender in this domestic abuse incident and will also limit FAP and
command’s ability to provide the most comprehensive safety plan.
