1. Responsibilities.
     1.1. IBDSS Equipment. A security alarm system, or ESS, is defined as a system designed
     to detect unauthorized intrusion into secure areas. The system consists of electronic
     monitoring devices, detection devices, associated transmission lines, power supplies, and
PACAFI32-1075 29 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  3


  signaling equipment. Scanners, cameras, radars, card readers, biometrics, and any other
  security device are not Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE) per AFI 32-9005. Any
  system installed with 3080 equipment funds would not be RPIE per AFI 65-601 Vol 1. All
  new installation of IBDSS/ESS are considered non-RPIE.
     1.1.1. HQ PACAF/A7 will provide maintenance funds for these non-Real Property
     (RP)/RPIE PACAF assets, if and only if one of the following is true:
         1.1.1.1. System directly supports Protection Level (PL) 1 through PL 3 assets.
         1.1.1.2. System is required as the only means of protection per AFI, Unified
         Facilities Criteria (UFC), Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Department of Defense
         Manual (DoDM), or other code and regulatory requirements (A consolidated list of
         all such approved systems are itemized in Table A2.1).
     1.1.2. Tenant units belonging to other MAJCOMs with IBDSS installed in the tenant
     facility will receive IBDSS maintenance on a reimbursable basis via individual support
     agreements.
     1.1.3. Acceptance documentation. Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 747,
     Communications and Information Systems Acceptance Certificate, will be used to accept
     all IBDSS equipment IAW AFI 31-101. Note: AFTO Form 747 replaced AF Form 1261.
     Equipment integral to the operation of ESS that is defined as RPIE and minor equipment
     installed/replaced incidental to the ESS project will be transferred as Real Property (RP)
     and conveyed using Department of Defense (DD) Form 1354, Transfer and Acceptance
     of Department of Defense (DoD) Real Property.
  1.2. IBDSS – Legacy Real Property and Real Property Installed Equipment. Under the
  PACAF initiated Command and Control (C2) and ESS modernization program in 2004, the
  command standardized all IDS to Vindicator® Command and Control Platform (VCCP) v5-
  Version 5.0 or later systems which replaced older legacy head end systems. During this
  transition, there were still legacy intrusion alarm systems or IDS that meet the criteria of RP
  and RPIE in accordance with AFI 32-9005. However, these systems were to be migrated out
  of service and placed under the new installation ESS head end. If there are alarm systems
  that have not yet migrated off legacy systems and are still listed as real property, the
  installation shall migrate those systems and remove them from the real property records IAW
  AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property, using AF Form 300, Facility Disposal.
  1.3. IBDSS – PL 4. PL 4 or lower assets not listed in Table A2.1 are the owner/users
  responsibility to fund and maintain (to include install costs; maintenance/sustainment costs;
  allied support costs such as power/data communication, and physical security upgrades).
  Tenant units and organizations will always be responsible to fund and maintain IBDSS
  supporting their asset. Owner/users may solicit the BCE for maintenance on these systems
  (stand alone or connected to the base security network) on a reimbursable basis; the BCE has
  the authority to accept this responsibility if they are capable of managing it via individual
  support agreements. IDSs are not required for PL 4 or lower resources not listed in Table
  A2.1.
  1.4. Other ESS. For owner/users that wish to utilize ESS to meet desired/enhanced
  requirements for ease of use and security, these systems will be procured and maintained by
 4                                                        PACAFI32-1075 29 OCTOBER 2013


     the owner/user and not tied into the main base head end system. Prior to installation,
     coordinate efforts with local BCE to coordinate facility support.
2. New IBDSS installations and upgrades/renewals. Per AFI 31-101 and its PACAF
supplement, all units will submit new IBDSS installations/upgrade requirements through their
group commander to the Installation Alarm Working Group (AWG) for validation. The AWG
will forward recommendations to the Integrated Defense Council (IDC) for approval. The IDC
is chaired by the Installation Commander or designee IAW AFI 31-101. Once approved at the
base level, the IDC will forward requirements to HQ PACAF AWG for final approval. This
process will allow HQ PACAF/A7O to facilitate command program management, configuration
control and integration. HQ PACAF/A7S and A7O will plan and program for installation
funding, testing and certification of PACAF Priority IBDSS projects (as assigned by the AWG).
HQ PACAF/A7P will work with installations to plan and program for Restoration and
Modernization (R&M) projects for submission into the applicable fiscal year R&M centralized
budget. HQ PACAF/A7O will plan and program for maintenance and sustainment of assigned
PACAF Priority IBDSS projects and R&M Projects. A detailed flow chart of the organizational
responsibilities within the IBDSS approval and certification process is included in Figure A3.1.
     2.1. Installation criteria. The Civil Engineer Squadron (CES) and Security Force Squadron
     (SFS) will coordinate and manage IBDSS installations in accordance with applicable
     technical orders, regulations, directives, and local policies. All IBDSS installs will follow
     the guidance of UFC 4-021-02NF, Security Engineering Electronic Security Systems and the
     Standardized Electronic Security Equipment Siting and Design Guidance for Permanent
     Installations, ESE-SIT-0001. IBDSS using the VCCP v5- Version 5.0 or later are required in
     all PACAF IBDSS installations. To ensure compatibility with the VCCP v5- Version 5.0 or
     later, units will use IDS & ACS equipment from the Non-Nuclear IDS Equipment Approval
     Memorandum distributed by HQ USAF/A7S. Installations of PL 4 assets identified in Table
     A2.1 (SCIFs and SAPs) will be accomplished by respective security personnel.
     2.2. Installation & Modification approval. Unit personnel will not install or modify
     IBDSS without prior approval of the supporting installation BCE and SFS through the
     installation AWG and IDC.           If the system is supporting PL 1-3 assets then
     HQ PACAF/A7S/A7O will provide final approval. Sensitive Compartmented Information
     Facility (SCIF) systems will require Accrediting Official (AO) approval via the base Special
     Security Officer (SSO) & HQ PACAF/A2S. AOs for SCIFs are from National Security
     Agency (NSA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) or another SCIF accrediting agencies,
     HQ PACAF/Special Security Office (A2S) will help determine who the AO is. Special
     Access Program (SAP) systems will require HQ PACAF/A3XZ approval via the MAJCOM
     Senior Government SAP Security Officer (GSSO). Information Protection (IP)/open storage
     systems will require wing Information Protection Office (IPO) and HQ PACAF/IP approval
     and certification.
     2.3. Communications infrastructure support. Communications infrastructure (dry copper
     pairs or single mode fiber supporting IBDSS) between facilities remains the responsibility of
     the installation Communications Squadron (CS). If the IBDSS maintainer identifies
     problems with the communications infrastructure, the IBDSS maintainer will notify the
     supporting installation CS support desk. New installs and life-cycle refresh projects shall
     utilize fiber infrastructure as much as possible to ensure future supportability.
PACAFI32-1075 29 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  5


  2.4. Allied Support. In order to properly install IBDSS, there may be a need to provide
  additional capital improvements, such as fencing, Entry Control Facilities (ECF),
  communications rooms or lighting, to support the installation of alarms, cameras or
  supporting communications equipment. In this case, that allied support need is still funded
  and authorized under their respective construction activity, the use of turn-key procurement
  does not preclude or create any exception(s) to the legal use of appropriated funds.
     2.4.1. Any real property allied support improvement will be capitalized on a DD
     Form 1354.
  2.5. PL 1-3 Restricted Facilities & PL 1-3 Restricted Areas (RA)s ESS. Requirements
  are covered in AFI 31-101 and it’s PACAF Supplement. HQ PACAF/A7S /A7O will plan
  and program all installs exceeding $250K using other procurement funds IAW AFI 65-601
  Vol 1. These projects will be prioritized on the PACAF IBDSS Priority Project List which is
  centrally funded by AF A7S.
     2.5.1. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
         2.5.1.1. IDS for Facilities. PL 1-3 facilities that are manned 24-hours a day are not
         required to have IDS; however, they must have a duress alarm that terminates at the
         Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC) IAW AFI 31-101 and the PACAFSUP.
         PL 1-3 facilities that are not manned 24-hours a day are required to have IDS. They
         must have a detection capability for all facility openings greater than 96 square inches
         that terminates at the BDOC responsible for dispatching response elements. PL 1-3
         facilities that have minimal manning during night/weekend/holiday hours and are too
         large for those occupants to monitor the entire facility will have IDS.
         2.5.1.2. IDS for Areas/Assets.
             2.5.1.2.1. PL 1 Areas/Assets require one line of detection at the restricted area
             boundary and one line of detection at each facility or individually exposed
             resource IAW AFI 31-101.
             2.5.1.2.2. PL 2 Areas/Assets require one line of detection at the restricted area
             boundary and another line of detection at the facility or resource(s) IAW AFI 31-
             101.
             2.5.1.2.3. PL 3 Areas/Assets require a line of detection adjacent to the restricted
             area boundary or individual resource boundary IAW AFI 31-101 and the
             PACAFSUP.
         2.5.1.3. IDS Funding. PL 1-3 IDS installations will be funded by the owning
         MAJCOM or tenant organization. PACAF PL 1-3 IDS projects less than $250K will
         be funded at the owner user or at base level using Operations & Maintenance (O&M)
         funds. PACAF will fund maintenance and sustainment of its PL 1-3 assets requiring
         IDS. Tenant organizations, or their owning MAJCOMs who have PL 1-3 assets at
         PACAF bases that require IDS, are responsible for maintenance and sustainment of
         their IDS.     Non-PACAF units/organizations may request maintenance on a
         reimbursable basis via their individual base support agreements.
         2.5.1.4. IDS Emergency Power. IDS shall be protected by independent backup
         power source providing a minimum of 4 to 12 hours of emergency operation
6                                                    PACAFI32-1075 29 OCTOBER 2013


       dependent on the asset being protected (DODM 52001.01-V3 and AFI31-101 6.3).
       The back-up power sources chosen shall be based on the most efficient minimally
       required source either by battery, uninterruptable power, or generator. Systems that
       are the responsibility of the owner/user are required to provide adequate UPS support
       and replace systems as directed by manufactures' established timeline.
    2.5.2. Access Control Systems (ACS). With the exception of PL 2 facilities designed
    and constructed after 8 Oct 2009, Automated Entry Control Systems (AECS) are not
    required for restricted areas; however, these electronic systems can significantly enhance
    the ability of Security Forces (SF)s and owner/user agencies to positively identify
    individuals who request entry into restricted and controlled areas IAW AFI 31-101.
    HQ PACAF A7O/A7S will determine if AECS is required for PL 1 facilities, areas/assets
    and PL 2 areas/assets based on manning and ECF throughput. PL 3 Air Sovereignty
    Alert (ASA) RA requires automated or manned entry control at a single Entry Control
    Point (ECP) to the restricted area IAW AFI 31-101. All other PL 3 facilities and
    areas/assets are not required to have AECS. PL 3 AECS related alarms will be monitored
    by the owner user.
       2.5.2.1. AECS. When AECS is employed, use standardized AECS level I, II or III
       systems to control entry to designated areas/facilities IAW AFI 31-101 Chapter 7.
       2.5.2.2. ACS/AECS Funding. PL 1 and 2 and ASA PL 3 ACS installations,
       maintenance, and sustainment will be funded by the owning MAJCOM or tenant
       organization. All other PL 3 ACS installations, maintenance, and sustainment will be
       funded by the owner/user or wing. Non-PACAF units may request maintenance on a
       reimbursable basis via their individual base support agreements.
    2.5.3. PSS-CCTV & CCTV. All permanent restricted areas containing PL 1-3
    resources must employ an IDS concept of operations that provides Immediate Visual
    Assessment (IVA) of exterior alarms. SFs perform assessment in near-real time to
    determine the cause of an alarm and initiate an appropriate response. Near-real time is
    defined as that period of time between notification of an event, such as an alarm, and the
    assessment of the event. The time should be as close to instantaneous as possible. Visual
    assessment of exterior sensor zones is a vital and essential requirement for security
    programs. Ideally, the SFS should be able to make an immediate visual assessment of
    any sector from which an alarm is received. Fixed cameras provide near real-time alarm
    assessment capability for all sectors of the boundary. Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras can
    provide surveillance of areas outside and inside the protected area and aid in the
    deployment of security forces.
       2.5.3.1. PL 1 and 2 requirements for exterior CCTV and lighting systems should
       follow ESE-SIT-0001; it is a design goal that all PL 1 and 2 areas be equipped for
       complete video alarm assessment monitored from the BDOC. Exterior lines of
       detection for PL 1 and 2 assets, areas and facilities will have fixed camera CCTV
       coverage for visual assessment a limited number of PTZs may be used for
       surveillance.
       2.5.3.2. PL 3 ASA RAs requires continuous CCTV surveillance capability monitored
       at the BDOC. Exterior lines of detection for PL 3 assets, areas and facilities will have
PACAFI32-1075 29 OCTOBER 2013                                                               7


         as a minimum PTZ camera CCTV coverage for visual surveillance, fixed cameras
         will be used for unmanned ECPs and when more economical than PTZs.
         2.5.3.3. CCTV Funding. PL 1-3 CCTV installs and maintenance in excess of the
         requirements in paragraph 2.5.3 will be funded by the owner user or base. Non-
         PACAF units may request maintenance on a reimbursable basis via their individual
         base support agreements.
  2.6. Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) ESS. Requirements and
  standards are covered in Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 704, 705 and Intelligence
  Community Standards (ICS) 705-1 and 705-2. Specific SCIF IDS and ACS requirements are
  contained in Intelligence Community (IC) Technical Specification (Tech Spec) for ICD/ICS
  705 (IC Tech Spec 705). SCIFs accredited prior to 26 May 2010 (publication date of ICD
  705) are not required to upgrade to current IDS standards. The Accrediting Official (AO)
  shall approve all system plans for IDS. The IDS system administrator with knowledge of the
  systems key controls & variables will be SCI indoctrinated, IAW IC Tech Spec 705.
     2.6.1. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). SCIFs shall be protected by IDS when not
     occupied. IDS installation related components and monitoring stations shall comply with
     Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Standard for National Industrial Security Systems for the
     Protection of Classified Material, UL 2050. Installation shall comply with an Extent 3
     installation as referenced in UL 2050. Systems developed and used exclusively by the
     U.S. Government do not require UL certification, but shall comply with an Extent 3
     installation as referenced in UL 2050.
         2.6.1.1. SCIF IDS sensors including motion sensors covering possible access points
         and doors, sensors above false ceilings or below false floors, High Security Switches
         (HSS)/Balanced Magnetic Switch (BMS)s for doors, window sensors and duress
         buttons will be installed, configured and operated IAW IC Tech Spec 705 and AFI
         31-101.
     2.6.2. Access Control Systems (ACS). SCIFs shall be controlled by Sensitive
     Compartmented Information (SCI)-indoctrinated personnel or by an AO- approved ACS
     to ensure access is restricted to authorized personnel. Visual recognition of persons
     entering the SCIF by an SCI-indoctrinated person at the entrance to a SCIF is the ideal
     access control. Entrances where visitor control is conducted shall be under continuous
     visual observation unless the SCIF is properly secured. An automated personnel ACS or
     AECS that verifies an individual’s identity before the individual is permitted unescorted
     access shall be utilized when continuous visual observation is not possible and personal
     recognition and verification is not used.
         2.6.2.1. AECS for SCIFs when required will employ two of three identification
         techniques, Identification (ID) Badge, Personal Identification Number (PIN) and/or
