       2.2.1. Act as a focal point for PMEL related questions within the 434 ARW.
       2.2.2. Maintain a list of equipment, per paragraph 2.5.1, requiring "on-site" calibration.
       2.2.3. Coordinate on-site calibration requests between owning work centers and WPAFB
       PMEL laboratory.

    within the 434 ARW at Grissom ARB solicit volunteers from TMDE customers within their
    squadron to perform PMEL rider duties on a rotating monthly basis. PMEL riders can be
    either management or bargaining unit employees. Squadron assignments for PMEL riders
    are shown in Attachment 1. PMEL riders must possess: (1) secret security clearances and
    (2) valid state drivers licenses.

    pickup. Classified equipment is picked up at the owning work center prior to departure to
    WPAFB PMEL Tuesday morning. PMEL riders ensure that they receive a security briefing
    from the owning work center prior to departure to WPAFB. The classified equipment hand
    receipts are placed in the PMEL receipt folder provided by the PMEL Equipment room.

     start of any calibration to ensure area is clean and orderly. After the work has been
     completed, the area will be inspected again by both parties to ensure work area is left in the
     same original condition. 434 ARW PMEL’s coordinator will be responsible for locking up
     the area. Appropriate power supplies and equipment will be provided by the 434 ARW
     PMEL section and all additional requests will be made in a timely manner and coordinated
     through the Wing PMEL coordinator and the facility manager for Bldg 427.
