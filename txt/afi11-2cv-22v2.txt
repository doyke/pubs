                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This instruction establishes requirements and grading criteria for ground and
flight phases of initial, requalification and periodic flight evaluations. Aircrew evaluations will
be conducted in accordance with (IAW) this instruction and AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented.
Specific areas for evaluation are prescribed to ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency
and capabilities of aircrews. Flight examiners use this AFI when conducting aircrew
evaluations. Instructors use this AFI when preparing aircrews for qualification.
1.2. Key words and definitions.
     1.2.1. ―Will‖ and ―Shall‖ indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.2.2. ―Should‖ is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.2.3. ―May‖ indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.2.4. ―Note‖ indicates operations procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
     emphasize.
1.3. Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication is HQ AFSOC/A3, IAW AFI 11-202,
Volume 2. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI, except for safety or when
necessary to protect the crew or aircraft from a situation not covered by this AFI and immediate
action is required. Report deviations or exceptions without waiver through channels to
MAJCOM Standardization/Evaluation function who in turn, notifies HQ AFSOC/A3V for
follow-on action, if necessary.
1.4. Revisions. Personnel are encouraged to submit proposed changes through stan/eval
channels IAW AFI 11-215. Use AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, for
comments and suggested improvements.
1.5. Supplements. Units are encouraged to supplement this instruction with standard evaluation
profiles that best fit the unit’s mission, equipment, and location. MAJCOMs will coordinate
with HQ Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC)/A3V and HQ USAF/A3OT prior to
publishing supplements. Units below MAJCOM level will forward one copy of each supplement
to their MAJCOM OPR for pre-publication review.
1.6. Evaluation Procedures. Flight examiners will use the evaluation criteria in this volume to
conduct all flight, aircrew training device (ATD), and emergency procedure evaluations (EPE).
Flight examiners will brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, and requirements of the
evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation criteria prior to flight. The examinee will
accomplish all required mission planning. If an Operations Planning Team or Deployment
Planning Team accomplishes mission planning, the examinee is ultimately responsible for the
accuracy and completeness of all mission-planning paperwork. Flight examiners will be
furnished a copy of necessary charts, flight logs, mission folders, and any additional items they
deem necessary.
AFI11-2CV-22V2 3 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                    5


   1.6.1. Flight examiners will ensure all required training and documentation is complete prior
   to initial/requalification evaluations.
   1.6.2. Unless requested by examinee and approved by squadron operations officer or
   designated representative, the examinee will be current for all events evaluated during a
   periodic evaluation.
   1.6.3. Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight. During the
   critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations,
   area/sub area grades assigned, and any additional training required.
1.7. Flight Examiner Role. The pilot flight examiner should occupy a primary crew position
during evaluations. Flight Engineer examiners will not occupy a primary crew position while
administering evaluations.
   1.7.1. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
   but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight. (Exception: During
   evaluations conducted in ATDs, equipment may be failed or disabled.)
   1.7.2. During pilot initial or requalification evaluations either a qualified instructor pilot or
   flight examiner will be at a set of controls.
1.8. Grading Instructions. To ensure standard and objective evaluations, flight examiners will
be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria. Flight examiner judgment will be
the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
   1.8.1. The evaluator will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air
   and a stable aircraft. Do not consider a momentary deviation from tolerances provided the
   examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying
   safety. The evaluator will consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall
   grade.
   1.8.2. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a satisfactory
   knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
   tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
   1.8.3. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea tasks, but
   requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner. Deviations
   from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight
   safety.
   1.8.4. U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable parameters, or
   deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely affected mission
   accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade
   of U normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of the flight examiner,
   additional training will not constructively improve examinee’s performance, it is not
   required. In this case, the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief the examinee.
1.9. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew member in
order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member receives an
unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will also be
unqualified. Critical areas are identified by (CRITICAL) in the area title and by shading of the
Q- block on the appropriate evaluation worksheet.
 6                                                         AFI11-2CV-22V2 3 FEBRUARY 2011


     1.9.1. Safety/judgment, aircrew discipline, airmanship/situational awareness (SA),
     instructional abilities and boldface are considered critical. If one of these sub-areas is graded
     U, then the overall grade for the evaluation will be Q-3.
1.10. Evaluation Requirements. Conduct flight evaluations as specified in AFI 11-202V2 as
supplemented, the specific crew position chapter and associated tables of this volume.
Examiners will use the criteria contained in this volume to accomplish all flight, ATD, and
emergency procedures evaluations. Do not conduct two consecutive evaluations in the
simulator. (Exception: Instrument (INSTM) evaluations). Initial qualification (QUAL) Mission
(MSN) and Special Mission Event (SME) evaluations will be accomplished in the aircraft.
     1.10.1. Alternate Method. When it is impossible to evaluate an area in flight due to
     equipment malfunctions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, or weather, the
     area may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., ATD, or verbal examination). If, in the
     flight examiner’s judgment, an item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method,
     complete the evaluation on an additional flight.
     1.10.2. If an area/subarea was not able to be evaluated in flight, and the event is certified for
     evaluation purposes in the simulator, it can be evaluated in the simulator to complete the
     evaluation. Document in the comments section of AF IMT Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew
     Qualification, which portion(s) of evaluation were conducted in simulator.
1.11. Unsatisfactory Performance. If the flight examiner observes an aircrew counterpart
jeopardizing safety, the examiner will assume the duties of that aircrew member (provided the
examiner’s flight duty period (FDP) does not exceed AFI 11-202V3 General Flight Rules
maximum FDP for an un-augmented crew). This does not mean the examiner must assume the
examinee’s position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed. If the examiner feels the
examinee can continue safely with supervision, the examiner is not required to assume the
examinee’s duties. However, if the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties, assign a
Qualification Level 3 (Q-3) as the overall grade.
     1.11.1. Evaluators     must   report    deviations/discrepancies  from     established
     procedures/directives in any area, regardless of the individual’s crew specialty, to
     squadron/group commander, along with evaluator’s recommendation for corrective action,
     IAW AFI 11-202V2 and MAJCOM supplement.
1.12. Additional Training. Flight examiners are responsible for assigning additional training at
their discretion. Document additional training and completion IAW AFI 11-202V2 and
MAJCOM supplement. Any approved training device or medium may be used for additional
training.
     1.12.1. Additional training may be accomplished on the same flight as the evaluation,
     provided the unique situation presents a valuable training opportunity and the discrepancy
     requiring the additional training will not result in overall Q-3 evaluation. This option
     requires flight examiner discretion and judicious application. The examinee must be
     informed when the additional training begins and ends.
1.13. Rechecks. Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the
one who administered the original evaluation.
1.14. Flight Examiners.
AFI11-2CV-22V2 3 FEBRUARY 2011                                                               7


   1.14.1. Evaluators must be instructor qualified in a given event prior to acting as an
   evaluator in the event.
   1.14.2. Certified evaluators who subsequently add special mission instructor or other
   instructor qualifications are automatically certified to evaluate these new qualifications.
   1.14.3. For evaluations administered by unit evaluators to unit members the unit chief of
   stan/eval flight examiner, or squadron commander determine when the evaluation is
   complete. For evaluations administered by outside flight examiners (MAJCOM, cross
   command, ASEV etc.) the evaluator determines when the evaluation is complete.
1.15. Special Qualifications. Special qualification evaluations are administered for Special
Mission Events. These events are not universal to all crewmembers. Special qualification
evaluations may be conducted separately or in conjunction with qualification/mission
evaluations. After qualification, areas can be graded as part of periodic mission evaluations.
There are no requisites for special qualification evaluations unless specified. Refer to
appropriate crew position chapter for any special qualification evaluation requirement, and AFI
11-202 Vol 2 for AF Form 8/8a procedures.
   1.15.1. Special mission evaluations are defined per AFI 11-2CV-22V1 CV-22 Aircrew
   Training and this publication; and results in an AF Form 8/8a. Special mission evaluations
   will be annotated as SPOT evaluations in the Flight Phase block of the AF Form 8/8a and the
   Type of Evaluation block on the AF Form 942. If SME current/qualified and the SME is
   accomplished during the evaluation profile, the SME will be evaluated during the MSN
   evaluation but annotated separately on the AF Form 8/8a in the Mission Description.

                                            Chapter 2

                                     ALL EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. The general grading criteria contained in this chapter applies to all crew positions
and all evaluations. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform required
duties safely and effectively. This includes appropriate aircraft systems operation IAW
applicable technical orders, instructions, and directives.
2.2. Requirements. Evaluate all crewmembers on areas listed in Table 2.1.
     2.2.1. Examinations. All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations
     as a requisite to periodic evaluations IAW AFI 11-202V2 and applicable supplements.
     2.2.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluation. An EPE is a requisite for all QUAL and MSN
     evaluations except special mission evaluations. EPEs may be conducted verbally, in-flight,
     in a simulator, or by another method determined by the examiner or unit stan/eval.
     Operations Group stan/eval may develop EPE guides for each crew position for flight
     examiner use. EPEs should be scenario driven, and tailored to the specific crew position.
     The EPE will include areas commensurate with the examinee’s qualification and experience
     level. Examiners should include other general knowledge areas as well. For mission
     evaluations, evaluate mission-specific equipment and situations. EPEs will include sufficient
     in-flight and ground emergencies to evaluate the examinee’s knowledge of systems and
     procedures to the flight examiner’s satisfaction.
        2.2.2.1. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The
        examinee must recite all BOLDFACE items from memory and should provide the initial
        steps of emergency procedures that, in the opinion of the examiner, would not allow time
        for reference.
     2.2.3. Publications Check. Required for all QUAL or combined QUAL/MSN evaluations
     as outlined in area 12 of General Grading Areas and AFI 11-215.
     2.2.4. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290,
     Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, crew resource management skills
     will be evaluated during initial and periodic evaluations. CRM skills are integral to all
     phases of flight; therefore, no specific area titled CRM exists. CRM skills are imbedded
     within specific grading criteria (mission planning, airmanship/situational awareness, crew
     coordination, communication, risk management/decision making, task management, and
     briefing/debriefing) and include all of the skills listed on the AF IMT Form 4031, CRM Skills
     Criteria Training/ Evaluation Form. Therefore, use of the AF IMT Form 4031 is
     unnecessary for evaluations.
     2.2.5. Formal Course Evaluations. All required areas must be evaluated for the type of
     evaluation flown, IAW guidance in this volume. Grade training objectives and related areas

                                  PILOT EVALUATIONS

4.1. General. All pilots require a QUAL and INSTM evaluation; these two evaluations are
normally combined and can be completed in either the aircraft, an ATD or a combination of the
two. MSN qualified pilots require a separate MSN evaluation. Evaluation standards will be
administered in accordance with the individual’s crew position as listed below:
   4.1.1. Basic Aircraft Qualified (BAQ) pilot (FP), Mission Pilot (MP):
       4.1.1.1. FPs and MPs are evaluated to the standards outlined in Table 2.1 and Table 4.1-
       4.3
       4.1.1.2. MPs certified as aircraft commanders will be evaluated as aircraft commanders
       and formation lead. This implies they have command of the aircraft, crew, and
       formation.
   4.1.2. Evaluator Pilots (EP): EPs may be evaluated IAW Table 4.1 and AFI 11-202V2.
4.2. Requirements. Refer to Chapter 2 for general and Chapter 3 for instructor grading areas
and criteria. Pilot required areas and criteria follow in this chapter.
   4.2.1. Qualification (QUAL):
       4.2.1.1. See Table 4.1 and Table 4.3 for required QUAL evaluation areas. Requisites
       (prerequisites for initial/re-qualification evaluations) include qualification open and
       closed book examinations (or formal school end of course examinations), EPE
       (requisite), and boldface examination. This evaluation can be accomplished in
       combination with the INSTM evaluation IAW paragraph 1.10
          4.2.1.1.1. Initial QUAL evaluations will be accomplished in the aircraft.
          Requalification evaluations should be conducted in the aircraft.
       4.2.1.2. The evaluation profile will include: visual flight rules (VFR) pattern; roll-on
       landing, normal and steep approach, airland, approach to hover and hovering maneuvers;
       engine-out go-around (simulated in aircraft), and simulated engine-out landing (simulated
       in aircraft).
   4.2.2. Instrument (INSTM):
       4.2.2.1. See Tables 4.1 and 4.3 for required INSTM evaluation areas. The evaluation
       profile will include: One precision; two non-precision approaches; holding or procedure
       turn, and a missed approach. Both INIT and recurring INSTM evaluations may be
       accomplished in either the aircraft or an ATD.
       4.2.2.2. The instrument written examination is a requisite (prerequisite for initial and
       requalification evaluations).
       4.2.2.3. The instrument and qualification flight evaluations may be combined. NOTE:
       The MV-22 is considered a different MDS, therefore, all pilots require a CV-22
       QUAL/INSTM evaluation. NATOPS evaluation forms will be maintained in the pilot’s
       FEF.
 20                                                     AFI11-2CV-22V2 3 FEBRUARY 2011


   4.2.3. Mission:
        4.2.3.1. See Tables 4.2 and 4.3 for MSN evaluation areas and subparagraphs below for
        requirements. Requisites (prerequisites for initial/re-qualification evaluations) include
        Mission Open and Closed Book examinations (or formal school end of course
        examinations) and EPE.
        4.2.3.2. Evaluations will be accomplished at night.
        4.2.3.3. For all mission evaluations, flight examiners will ensure evaluation profiles
        include demonstration of an adequate number of events to thoroughly measure
        knowledge of specific employment procedures to include tactical defensive measures.
        One form of low level will be accomplished every other year.
   4.2.4. Special Mission Event (SME):
        4.2.4.1. SMEs are listed in AFI 11-2CV-22V1, CV-22 Aircrew Training.
        4.2.4.2. See Table 4.2 for SME evaluations.
        4.2.4.3. Initial SME evaluations may be conducted separately or in conjunction with a
        mission evaluation.
        4.2.4.4. If a pilot is SME current and qualified and the SME is accomplished during the
        evaluation profile, the SME is evaluated during the MSN evaluation but annotated
        separately on the AF IMT Form 8/8a.
        4.2.4.5. There are no requisites for SME evaluations.
        4.2.4.6. Annotate the specifics of SME evaluations in the ―Comments‖ section of the AF
        IMT 8/8a.

are listed in Table 5.1; areas marked by an X are required to complete the specific evaluation.
5.3. QUAL Evaluations (QUAL). This type of evaluation is for FEs that maintain BAQ status
only. See Table 5.1 for required QUAL evaluation requirements. QUAL evaluations may be
accomplished during daylight hours.
5.4. Combined Qualification/Mission Evaluations (QUAL/MSN). QUAL/MSN evaluations
will be accomplished at night. For all QUAL/MSN evaluations, flight examiners will ensure
evaluation profiles include demonstration of adequate events to thoroughly measure knowledge
of specific employment procedures. BAQ flight engineers upgrading to mission flight engineers
will complete a full QUAL/MSN evaluation to realign their periodic expiration date as
appropriate.
   5.4.1. Hoist/Alternate Insertion and Extraction (AIEs).
         5.4.1.1. Hoist/AIE requirements. Both initial and periodic evaluations require the
         performance of at least one type of AIE using actual equipment (i.e. hoist, fast rope). For
         periodic evaluations, if certified, live AIEs are encouraged, but not required.
   5.4.2. Special Mission Event: SMEs are listed in AFI 11-2CV-22V 1. Initial SME
   evaluations may be conducted separately or in conjunction with a mission evaluation. If a FE
   is current and qualified and the SME is accomplished during the evaluation profile, the SME
   is evaluated during the MSN evaluation but annotated separately on the AF Form 8/8a.
         5.4.2.1. Ramp Mounted Weapon System. Once trained and evaluated on one gun system
         during the initial SME evaluation, subsequent certification on any other system does not
         require an evaluation. Document certification IAW AFI 11-2CV-22 Vol 1.
         5.4.2.2. FEs qualified in more than one gun system may be evaluated on either system.
         Verbally evaluate the system not evaluated by performance. Do not verbally evaluate the
         same system on subsequent evaluations.
