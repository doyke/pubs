  2.2. Supervisors of at risk workers will provide initial and annual training as required by 29
  CFR 1910.1030, Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens, see Attachment 5 for
  training requirements.
     2.2.1. Supervisors will ensure initial training is documented on the employee's AF Form
     55 or on computerized training record, or equivalent, as Initial Bloodborne Pathogen
     training.
     2.2.2. Supervisors will ensure annual training is documented on the employee's AF Form
     55 or computerized training record, as Annual Bloodborne Pathogen Training.
  2.3. Personal Protective Equipment. Supervisors will:
     2.3.1. Ensure adequate PPE (gloves, masks, goggles, face shields, outer protective
     garments, etc.) is available for workers to use at all times where there is a potential for
     occupational exposure to blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials.
     2.3.2. Enforce the wearing of PPE during procedures in which there is a potential for
     occupational exposure to blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials.
     Noncompliance of workers to adhere to policies and directives of this program must be
     immediately addressed through appropriate administrative procedures.             These
     administrative actions will be documented on AF Form 55 in the comments section. This
     policy is established to protect the government's financial interest and to protect the
     worker's health.
     2.3.3. Evaluate worker's duty performance during an exposure incident. If worker does
     not wear appropriate PPE or PPE is breached during the incident, the supervisor will
     complete a narrative summary (which will include the individual's name, job description,
     source of the blood, body fluid, or other infectious materials if known, and a statement on
     how the exposure occurred) of the situation and forward copies to Ground Safety
     Division (355 FW/SEG) and Public Health (355 AMDS/SGPM) for their information and
     action.
  2.4. Exposure Incident: If a worker is actually EXPOSED to blood, body fluids, or other
  potentially infectious materials in the course of their duties, (i.e. a needle puncture wound,
  getting cut with a contaminated object such as glass, or having blood splash on the skin or
  mucous membranes of the eyes, nose or mouth) the supervisor will immediately send the
  exposed worker and, if possible, the source individual to 355 MDG for appropriate
  evaluation, treatment, and follow-up.
     2.4.1. Primary Care Provider or Occupational Health Consultant will:
         2.4.1.1. Evaluate the worker's potential exposure to bloodborne pathogens using
         criteria developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on the
         type of exposure and source's risk factors.
         2.4.1.2. If indicated, ensure appropriate testing of the source as well as testing,
         treatment, and follow-up care for the exposed worker is accomplished in a timely
         manner.
         2.4.1.3. Notify the exposed worker of the necessity for treatment and follow-up.
 6                                              DAVISMONTHANAFBI48-103 4 APRIL 2011


            2.4.1.4. Provide a written opinion on the individual's exposure incident and
            recommended follow-up care. Ensure the written opinion is placed in the individual's
            medical record.
            2.4.1.5. Ensure appropriate follow-up is accomplished following Centers for Disease
            Control and Prevention guidelines.
        2.4.2. The organization where the exposure incident occurred will ensure that areas,
        equipment, clothing, and materials contaminated by blood, body fluids, or other
        potentially infectious material are appropriately decontaminated. This may be done by
        properly trained unit employees or by certified contractors. Consultation with the Public
        Health office on spills that may be beyond the scope of the unit to take care of internally
        is appropriate.
        2.4.3. Unit decontamination team will:
            2.4.3.1. Decontaminate and dispose of any blood, body fluids, or other potentially
            infectious materials using appropriately trained personnel and the procedures outlined
            in Attachment 6. If it is determined that use of bleach is not feasible due to its
            caustic nature (i.e. on equipment panels) the unit should consult with the Public
            Health office for an alternate method of decontamination.
            2.4.3.2. Place all contaminated articles which are to be disposed of in a biological
            hazard bag. This task will be accomplished by appropriately trained organizational
            personnel wearing the proper PPE, including: puncture-resistant waterproof gloves, a
            protective outer garment, and shoe coverings, if there is a potential for contaminating
            the workers shoes. If aerosolization or splattering of blood, body fluids, or other
            potentially infectious materials is expected, individuals must wear a mask and
            goggles or face shield. The biohazard bags will be handled and transported
            appropriately to building 401, (report to 355 MDG Facility Management, at 228-2557
            or 2558 during duty hours). The biohazard bags will be disposed of in the medical
            waste disposal system by personnel from the originating organization. If waste
            contains sharp items, such as broken glass, needles, or knives, these must be placed in
            a puncture resistant container which is sealed prior to placing it in the biohazard bag.
            2.4.3.3. Attachment 7 provides a recommended inventory for a blood or body fluid
            spill kit.
3. Contracted Operations
     3.1. The Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO), with assistance from Public Health and
     work area supervisor (if requested), will advise contractors of the need to follow OSHA
     guidance provided in 29 CFR 1910.1030. Protection for contract employees and appropriate
     disposal of collected waste should be the responsibility of the contractor.
     3.2. Units planning to use contract services must proactively establish a standing contract
     that will be quickly initiated when required. Ideally, contract workers should be on scene
     within an hour of their notification. Do not wait until a BBP incident occurs to try and
     establish an adequate contract.
4. Record Keeping
DAVISMONTHANAFBI48-103 4 APRIL 2011                                                           7


   4.1. Training record must be appropriately maintained by the organization for the duration of
   the worker’s employment. Organizations are required to provide the employee, upon
   request, the employee's training records for examination and copying.
   4.2. Medical record:
      4.2.1. The 355 MDG will maintain all civilian and military medical records and all
      documentation pertaining to the medical status of each individual who is identified as
      having a reasonably anticipated occupational exposure to BBP in the course of his/her
      duties.
      4.2.2. The medical record will contain a copy, if designated to receive vaccine, of the
      employee's hepatitis B vaccination status (or declination statement), including the dates
      of all the hepatitis B vaccinations, or any medical records relative to the employee's
      ability to receive the vaccination; along with medical testing, test results, health
      professional's written opinion, and follow-up procedures pertaining to any occupational
      exposures.

DAVIS-MONTHAN AFB BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS
EXPOSURE CONTROL PROGRAM
WITH DETAILED EXPLANATIONS
UNIT: _________________________________________
PREPARATION DATE: __________________________
CERTIFYING OFFICIAL: ________________________
(THIS SAMPLE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ONLY AS A GUIDE TO ASSIST IN
COMPLYING WITH 29 CFR 1910.1030, OSHA'S BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS
STANDARD. ORGANIZATIONS WILL NEED TO ADD RELEVANT INFORMATION
OR CHANGE/DELETE INFORMATION NON RELEVANT TO THEIR PARTICULAR
ORGANIZATION/FUNCTION IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE,
COMPREHENSIVE EXPOSURE CONTROL PROGRAM. ORGANIZATIONS MUST
REVIEW THE STANDARD FOR PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO
THEIR SPECIFIC SITUATION. THE EXPOSURE CONTROL PROGRAM MUST BE
REVIEWED ANNUALLY AND UPDATED WHEN NECESSARY.)
In accordance with the OSHA Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, 29
CFR 1910.1030, the following exposure control program has been developed.
A2.1. EXPOSURE DETERMINATION
OSHA requires employers to perform an exposure determination concerning which employees
may incur occupational exposure to blood, body fluids or other potentially infectious materials.
The exposure determination is made without regard to the use of personal protective equipment.
This exposure determination requires a listing of ALL job classifications in which ALL
employees may be expected to be exposed, regardless of frequency.
   A2.1.1. List job classifications where ALL employees have been determined to have a
   reasonably anticipated occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens.




JOB TITLE                                          JOB SERIES/AFSC
(List Title)                                       (List Job Series or AFSC)
(I.e. Public Health (PH) Technician)


In addition, if the organization has job classifications in which SOME employees may have
occupational exposure, a listing of those classifications is required. Since not all the employees
in these categories would be expected to incur exposure to blood, body fluids, or other
DAVISMONTHANAFBI48-103 4 APRIL 2011                                                                11


potentially infectious materials, a listing of tasks or procedures is required to clearly understand
which employees are considered to have occupational exposure.
   A2.1.2. List job classifications where SOME employees have been determined to have a
   reasonably anticipated occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens while performing
   specific job tasks and procedures.

A2.2. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE AND METHODOLOGY
This plan also requires a schedule and method of implementation for the various requirements of
the standard. The following complies with this requirement:
   A2.2.1. UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS: The term "universal precaution" refers to an
   infectious disease control system intended to prevent health care and Public Health workers
   from parenteral, mucous membrane, and non-intact skin exposures to bloodborne pathogens.
   Assume all blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal fluids, cerebrospinal, lymph, pericardial,
   etc.) are potentially infectious and appropriate barriers must be established between the
   patient's blood, body fluids, and other infectious materials and the health care and public
   safety worker. Under circumstances where differentiation between body fluid types is
   difficult or impossible, consider all body fluids potentially infectious. Consider all blood,
   body fluid, or other potentially infectious materials infectious regardless of the perceived
   status of the source individual.
   A2.2.2. ENGINEERING AND WORK PRACTICE CONTROLS: Utilize engineering and
   work practice controls to eliminate or minimize exposure to employees. Where occupational
   exposure remains after institution of these controls, use personal protective equipment.

 THE FOLLOWING ENGINEERING CONTROLS WILL BE UTILIZED:
CONTROLS
(List controls, i.e. sharps containers, hand washes, eye washes, etc.)

The above controls will be examined and maintained on a regular schedule. The schedule for
reviewing the effectiveness of the controls is as follows (list schedule such as daily, weekly,
etc.). List who (individual or section) has responsibility to review the effectiveness of the
individual controls.
INSPECTIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED FOR THE FOLLOWING CONTROLS:
CONTROL                                             INSPECTION CONTROL
(Hand washes)                                       (Weekly/Inspected by SGT XXXX/or
                                                     list responsible section)

       A2.2.2.1. HAND WASHING FACILITIES: Employees who incur exposure to blood,
       body fluids or other infectious materials will wash at a readily accessible area. If hand
 12                                           DAVISMONTHANAFBI48-103 4 APRIL 2011


       washing facilities are not feasible, the organization is required to provide either an
       appropriate antiseptic hand cleanser in conjunction with a clean cloth/paper towels or
       antiseptic towelettes. If these alternatives are used, wash the hands with soap and
       running water as soon as feasible. Also, after removal of protective gloves, employees
       shall wash hands and any other potentially contaminated skin area immediately or as
       soon as feasible with soap and water. If employees incur exposure to mucous
       membranes, wash or flush those areas with running water immediately following contact.
       Organizations shall list locations of readily accessible hand washing facilities and
       alternatives to hand washing facilities. Organizations that must provide alternatives to
       readily accessible hand washing facilities must ensure the maintenance and accessibility
       of these alternatives.

 HAND WASHING STATIONS ARE LOCATED IN THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS:
PERMANENT STATION LOCATIONS                   PORTABLE STATION LOCATIONS
(List locations, i.e. patient rooms, procedure areas, vehicles, specific areas in hangars, etc.)

       A2.2.2.2. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)
           A2.2.2.2.1. All employees will use PPE to minimize or eliminate exposure risks.
           Consider equipment appropriate only if it does not permit blood, body fluids, or other
           potentially infectious materials to pass through or to reach the employee's clothing,
           skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes, under normal condition of use and
           for the duration of use.
           A2.2.2.2.2. Providing PPE: It is the responsibility of the individual organization to
           provide PPE for their employees at no cost to the employee. (List here who in the
           organization will provide PPE.) will provide to all employees at risk, PPE to
           include, but not limited to gloves, gowns, coats, masks, eye protection, and
           mouthpieces, resuscitation bags or other ventilation devices. Choose PPE based on
           the anticipated exposure to blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious
           materials. Make hypoallergenic gloves, powderless gloves, or other similar
           alternatives available for those employees who are allergic to the gloves normally
           used.
           A2.2.2.2.3. Enforcing the wearing of PPE: The supervisor or section head will
           enforce the use of PPE by all employees. Not wearing PPE when exposed to blood,
           body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials is only allowed under rare and
           extraordinary circumstances where specific use of PPE will prevent delivery of health
           care or pose as a safety hazard to the employee or co-workers. When the employee
           makes this judgment, the circumstances shall be investigated by the supervisor and
           documented on a/an ____________________, (use an appropriate form for official
           documentation) to determine whether changes need to be instituted to prevent
           further incidents where PPE is not worn.
           A2.2.2.2.4. Accessibility of PPE: The supervisor or section head will ensure
           availability of PPE in the work area and provide protective clothing to employees.
           The following (organization, person, unit, etc.) is responsible for distribution of
           PPE.

   A2.5.1. HANDLING CONTAMINATED NEEDLES, SHARP INSTRUMENTS OR
   OTHER CONTAMINATED ARTICLES: Education programs are to stress proper
   management of needles, sharp instruments, or other contaminated articles. Workers are to be
   aware of the occupational health hazards concerning their use. Common sense, safety, and
   environmental concerns are paramount in the workers handling and disposal of needles,
   sharp instruments, or other contaminated articles. Place emphasis on the minimal handling
   of these items.
       A2.5.1.1. Do not use hands to pick up sharp instruments, broken glass, needle/syringe
       units, or other sharp objects contaminated with blood, body fluids, or other potentially
       infectious materials. Pick the object up using other methods not requiring an individual
       to come in direct contact with the contaminated object, (i.e. tongs, forceps, a broom and
       dust pan, cardboard, etc.).
       A2.5.1.2. Place the contaminated objects in a puncture resistant, leak proof biohazard
       container, or other impervious, puncture resistant container to be placed in a biohazard
       bag and take to the 355th Medical Group (355 MDG), building 401, for disposal. If the
       organization does not have a suitable biohazard container, contact the 355 MDG to pick
       one up. You must exercise extreme caution when disposing of needles and sharp
       instruments/objects.
       A2.5.1.3. Place contaminated non-sharps, (i.e. contaminated gauze, towels, clothing,
       etc.) in a leak proof biohazard bag.

individuals (e.g. clinic personnel, fire department personnel, military members with potential
occupational blood or body fluid exposure) who have been identified as having risk of exposure
to blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials. All other designated civilian
employees will be offered the vaccine at no cost to the employee. The vaccine will be offered
within 10 working days of their initial assignment to work involving the potential for
occupational exposure to blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials unless the
employee has previously completed the vaccine series or is has a positive blood test for hepatitis
B surface antibodies. Civilian employees who decline must sign the hepatitis B declination
statement, Attachment 4, which is placed in their medical record kept at the hospital.

PREPARATION DATE: _________________________
CERTIFYING OFFICIAL: _______________________
In accordance with the OSHA occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens standard, 29 CFR
1910.1030, the following exposure control program has been developed.
A3.1. EXPOSURE DETERMINATION
   A3.1.1. Below is a list of job classifications where ALL employees have been determined to
   have a reasonably anticipated occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens.

A3.2. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE AND METHODOLOGY
   A3.2.1. UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS: The mandatory use of universal precautions will
   be effective ________________. The term "universal precaution" refers to an infectious
   disease control system intended to prevent health care and public safety workers from
   parenteral, mucous membrane, and non-intact skin exposures to bloodborne pathogens.
   Assume all blood and body fluids, (semen, vaginal fluids, cerebrospinal, lymph, pericardial,
   etc.) are potentially infectious, therefore appropriate barriers will be established between the
   patient's blood, body fluids, and other infectious materials and the health care and public
   safety worker. Under circumstances where differentiation between body fluid types is
   difficult or impossible, consider all body fluids potentially infectious. Consider all blood,
   body fluid, or other potentially infectious materials infectious regardless of the perceived
   status of the source individual.
   A3.2.2. ENGINEERING AND WORK PRACTICE CONTROLS: Utilize Engineering and
   work practice controls to eliminate or minimize exposure to employees. Where occupational
   exposure remains after institution of these controls, use personal protective equipment.

A3.2.2.1. HANDWASHING FACILITIES: Employees who incur exposure to blood, body
fluids or other infectious materials will wash at a readily accessible area. If hand washing
facilities are not feasible, the organization is required to provide either an appropriate antiseptic
hand cleanser in conjunction with a clean cloth/paper towels or antiseptic towelettes. If these
alternatives are used, wash the hands with soap and running water as soon as feasible. Also,
after removal of protective gloves, employees shall wash hands and any other potentially
contaminated skin area immediately or as soon as feasible with soap and water. If employees
incur exposure to mucous membranes, wash or flush those areas with running water immediately
following contact.

 HAND WASHING STATIONS ARE LOCATED IN THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS:

       A3.2.2.2. PROCEDURES:
           A3.2.2.2.1. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)
2.2.2.1.1. All employees will use PPE to minimize or eliminate exposure risks. Consider
equipment appropriate only if it does not permit blood, body fluids, or other potentially
infectious materials to pass through or to reach the employee's clothing, skin, eyes, mouth, or
other mucous membranes, under normal condition of use and for the duration of use.
               A3.2.2.2.1.2. Providing PPE:
                                 will provide to all employees at risk, PPE to include, but not
limited to gloves, gowns, coats, masks, eye protection, and mouthpieces, resuscitation bags or
DAVISMONTHANAFBI48-103 4 APRIL 2011                                                            23


other ventilation devices. Choose PPE based on the anticipated exposure to blood, body fluids,
or other potentially infectious materials. Make hypoallergenic gloves, powderless gloves, or
other similar alternatives available for those employees who are allergic to the gloves normally
used.
               A3.2.2.2.1.3. Enforcing the wearing of PPE:
The supervisor or section head will enforce the use of PPE by all employees. Not wearing PPE
when exposed to blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials is only allowed
under rare and extraordinary circumstances where specific use of PPE will prevent delivery
of health care or pose as a safety hazard to the employee or co-workers. When the employee
makes this judgment, the circumstances shall be investigated by the supervisor and documented
on an ____________________, to determine whether changes need to be instituted to prevent
further incidents where PPE is not worn.
               A3.2.2.2.1.4. Accessibility of PPE: The supervisor or section head will ensure
               availability of PPE in the work area and provide protective clothing to employees.
               The following __________________ is responsible for distribution of PPE.
               A3.2.2.2.1.5. Coordinate with Medical Supply on types of PPE available for
               purchase.

A3.3. 1. Remove all PPE penetrated by blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious
materials immediately or as soon as feasible. Remove all PPE prior to leaving the work area.
   A3.3.2. Place all contaminated PPE in an appropriately designated area or container for
   storage prior to decontamination or disposal. Handle contaminated disposable PPE as
   follows:
       A3.3.2.1. The buddy system should be used if more than one individual is involved.
       A3.3.2.2. Remove outer protective garment, (i.e. gown, apron, lab coat, etc.) fold
       garment in on itself as the garment is being removed and place in the biohazard bag.
       A3.3.2.3. Remove shoe covers and place in the biohazard bag.
       A3.3.2.4. Remove the face shield/goggles and place in designated storage area identified
       for holding contaminated PPE prior to decontamination for re-use.

   A3.5.1.     HANDLING CONTAMINATED NEEDLES, SHARP INSTRUMENTS OR
   OTHER CONTAMINATED ARTICLES: Education programs are to stress proper
   management of needles, sharp instruments, or other contaminated articles. Workers are to be
   aware of the occupational health hazards concerning their use. Common sense, safety, and
   environmental concerns are paramount in the workers handling and disposal of needles,
   sharp instruments, or other contaminated articles. Place emphasis on the minimal handling
   of these items.
      A3.5.1.1. Do not use bare hands to pick up sharp instruments, broken glass,
      needle/syringe units, or other sharp objects contaminated with blood, body fluids, or
      other potentially infectious materials. Pick the object up using other methods not
      requiring an individual to come in direct contact with the contaminated object, (i.e.
      tongs, forceps, a broom and dust pan, etc.).
      A3.5.1.2. Place the contaminated objects in a puncture resistant, leak proof biohazard
      container, and take to the 355th Medical Group, building 401, for disposal. If the
      organization does not have a suitable biohazard container, contact MDG Facility
      Management, at 228-2557 or 2558 during duty hours for assistance. You must exercise
      extreme caution when disposing of needles and sharp instruments.
      A3.5.1.3. Place contaminated non-sharps, (i.e. contaminated gauze, towels, clothing,
      etc.) in a leak proof biohazard bag.
   A3.5.2. NEEDLES: Do not bend, recap, remove, shear or purposely break contaminated
   needles and other contaminated sharps. OSHA allows an exception to this if the procedure
   requires the contaminated needle be recapped or removed and no alternative is feasible and
   the medical procedure requires the action. Use a mechanical device or one-handed technique
   if recapping or removal is required.

                 HEPATITIS B VACCINE DECLINATION STATEMENT

I, _____________________________, understand that due to my occupational exposure to
blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials I may be at risk of acquiring hepatitis
B virus (HBV) infection. I have been given the opportunity to be vaccinated with hepatitis B
vaccine, at no charge to myself. However, I decline hepatitis B vaccine at this time. I
understand that by declining this vaccine, I continue to be at risk of acquiring hepatitis B, a
serious disease. If in the future I continue to have occupational exposure to blood, body fluids,
or other potentially infectious materials during my employment at Davis-Monthan Air Force
Base and I want to be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, I can receive the vaccination series at
no charge to myself.

       DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURES FOR BLOOD AND BODY FLUIDS

The following procedures are recommended for "site specific" clean-up of spills involving blood
or body fluids. Five percent household bleach is used here, but any disinfectant used must be
first approved by the 355 MDG Infection Control Review Function. Also, outline in your unit's
exposure control program the procedures for clean-up using the disinfectant.
A6.1. Make a "spill kit” readily available for site clean-up. Place 1/2 cup of household bleach in
a dark brown or opaque bottle. (Heat and time degrade the qualities of bleach. Replace bleach
in kit at an interval not to exceed six months). Put the bleach, one gallon of water (don't mix the
two until you clean up a spill), pair of heavyweight, puncture resistant utility gloves, such as
those used for house cleaning and dish washing, 2 household sponges, and paper towels or gauze
in a plastic container or a box. Label the kit, attach a hazardous material sticker to the container
and place in an area where a spill may occur or in the trunk of a security vehicle, etc. Also have
the following available for large spills or spills that have the potential for splattering:
   A6.1.1. Clothing. You must use cloth or disposable gowns/coats to prevent blood
   contamination of clean-up workers’ clothing. A disposable plastic apron that covers the torso
   and thighs is recommended if there is a significant probability that blood or body fluids may
   be splashed onto the clean-up workers. At the completion of clean-up, discard the disposable
   apron into the biohazard waste bag.
   A6.1.2. Facial Protection. Wear facial protection if splattering of blood or body fluids is
   anticipated. A disposable mask offers protection for the nose and mouth. Plastic, wrap-
   around safety glasses offer adequate protection; however, if there is substantial risk of
   splattering of blood or body fluids, wear a full-face shield or goggles. Ordinary glasses do
   not offer adequate protection against splattering. After the completion of clean-up, discard
   disposable facial protection into a biohazard waste bag.
   A6.1.3. Shoes. If the spill is large and/or there is a potential of contaminating the worker's
   shoes, wear water-proof shoe covers.
   A6.1.4. DO NOT PICK UP CONTAMINATED SHARP OBJECTS BY HAND. If the
   spill contains broken glass or other sharp objects, these must be picked up without direct
   contact with hands. Use metal tongs, a broom and dust pan, or rigid sheets of cardboard used
   as "pusher" and "receiver" to pick up objects. Place sharp objects into a puncture-resistant
   container prior to placing into a biohazard waste bag.
A6.2. ABSORB THE SPILL. Absorb the bulk of spilled material prior to disinfection with
disposable absorbent material (paper towels, gauze pads, or if a small spill, sponge). If the spill
is large, granular absorbent material like that used to absorb caustic chemical spills may be used
(i.e. kitty litter). Blot (do not wipe) up the spill allowing the fluids to be absorbed by the towels,
etc. After absorption of the liquid, discard all materials into a biohazard waste bag.
A6.3. Mix the 1/2 cup of bleach with the one gallon of water. Flood the site or wipe down the
spill site with disposable towels or sponge soaked in bleach to make the site "glistening wet."
Allow the bleach solution to remain in contact with the infectious material for 10 minutes.

A6.4. Absorb the disinfectant with paper towels and dispose of the paper towels in a biohazard
waste bag. Alternatively, the spill site may be permitted to air dry.
A6.5. Rinse the spill site with water to remove a chemical residue. Dry the site to prevent
slipping.
A6.6. Place all disposable materials used in the decontamination process into a biohazard waste
bag. Dispose of the remaining disinfectant by pouring down the sanitary sewer.
A6.7. Decontaminate reusable materials and equipment following above procedures.
A6.8. If clothing becomes contaminated with blood or body fluids it should be removed as soon
as possible, the skin washed with soap and water, the clothing placed in a biohazard bag and
disposed of or cleaned by a laundry capable of handling blood contaminated clothing.
