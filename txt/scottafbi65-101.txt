Commanders/Directors; and paragraph 3 changed reimbursement procedures from filing an SF
1164, Claim For Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business, to using the Defense
Travel System (DTS).
1. Local Area Determination. The following counties; St. Clair, Clinton, Monroe, Madison
and Washington in Illinois and St. Louis County in Missouri are included in the local area of
Scott AFB IL. (Reference: Attachment 2 of this instruction.)
2. Responsibilities. Government vehicles should be used to the fullest extent to satisfy local
travel requirements. To accomplish this and conserve travel funds, managers at all levels must,
where possible, schedule requirements well in advance preferably at least 72 hours. The 375th
Logistics Readiness Squadron Distribution Deployment Operations Office (375 LRS/LGRDDO),
requires as much advance notice to assure availability of vehicle support. These procedures will
be followed:
     2.1. Traveler. When advised of a local travel requirement, the individual should request
     government vehicle support from the 375 LRS/LGRDDO.
        2.1.1. In accordance with AFI 24-301 paragraph 1.7.5., Logistics Readiness Squadron
        (LRS) Commanders/Directors are required to establish a permissible operating distance
        (POD) (Reference: Attachment 2 of this instruction) around the base in which
        Department of Defense (DoD)-owned or leased motor vehicles may operate without the
        approval of the host transportation squadron. The DoD maintains emergency and
        wartime requirements that cannot be met from commercial carriers. Requirements in
        excess of DoD capabilities shall be met by the use of commercial carriers. The POD is
        that distance from the installation that a government vehicle travels before competing
        with commercial carriers. The established Scott AFB POD is a 100-mile radius.
        2.1.2. The following agencies are automatically exempt from the POD: Air Force
        Courier Transfer Stations, Armed Forces Courier Service, Air Force Bands, Air Force
        Academy, Air Force Office of Special Investigation, 375 LRS/LGRDF,
        375LRS/LGRDDO, and Scott AFB Honor Guard when performing details. Other units
        that operate beyond this radius on a regular basis must submit a written request to 375
        LRS/LGRDDO for approval to exceed the POD. Any unit that exceeds the POD on a
        one-time basis must coordinate the approval of the trip with the vehicle operations chief
        dispatcher (375 LRS/ LGRDDO) at commercial (618) 256-3201/DSN 576-3201.
     2.2. Orders Issuing/Approving Official. When government vehicle support is not available,
     determine alternate mode of transportation. If a POV is determined advantageous, inform the
     traveler. Note: Members cannot be directed to use a POV for official business.
     2.3. Vehicle Operations Office. Where possible, provide government vehicle support to
     satisfy local travel requirements. If government vehicles cannot be made available, advise
     the requester.
3. Reimbursement Procedures. After travel is completed, the individual who was authorized
travel by POV will:
     3.1. File local voucher in DTS. Mileage expenses will be completed under “mileage” tab
     and non-mileage expenses will be completed under the “non mileage” tab.

  3.2. Assign the appropriate line of accounting within DTS.
  3.3. Sign the local voucher and use appropriate routing list for the unit funding the expenses.
