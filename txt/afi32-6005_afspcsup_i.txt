                                            Chapter 1

                          PHILOSOPHY AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Philosophy:
     1.1.1. Leadership at all levels is accountable for the success of the Air Force Unaccompanied
     Housing Program. Emphasis on UH as a Quality of Life (QoL) issue and the impact on
     readiness and retention have driven new DoD standards and priorities. Air Force dormitories
     and how we manage them are critical to the development process of unaccompanied Airmen.
     The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) and Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) are
     dedicated to providing a quality unaccompanied living environment that balances needs of
     Airmen with the needs of the Air Force. Our Air and Space Expeditionary Force requires
     trained warriors and leaders, and the first 3 years of an Airman’s career are key years in
     shaping a future noncommissioned officer (NCO) corps.
     1.1.2. Development and training extends into the private lives and living quarters of each
     Airman. The UH is an Airman’s personal residence and should be modern, functional, well
     maintained and comfortable, as well as promote pride, professionalism and personal dignity.
1.2. Responsibilities:

                                          Chapter 2

                                           POLICY

2.1. Unaccompanied Housing (UH) Management Concept. Installation UH management is
the responsibility of the UH Management Section aligned under the Asset Management Flight
within the CES. UH management duties must be performed by highly motivated personnel
dedicated to ensuring residents receive quality service.
2.1. (AFSPC)Unaccompanied Housing (UH) Management Concept. The Unaccompanied
Housing (UH) Management Concept is the standard for AFSPC bases. The consolidated UH
management section is aligned under the Capital Asset Element of the Asset Management Flight
or under the Housing Flight.
   2.1.1. UH Managers carry the Special Duty Identifier (SDI) 8H000, Airmen Dorm Leader,
   per the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory, and assigned for a minimum of 2 years
   with the option to extend for 1 additional year. The term Airmen Dorm Leader is equivalent
   to, and may be used synonymously with, Unaccompanied Housing Manager.
   2.1.2. Manpower authorizations are inherently governmental and earned based on an
   established manpower variance (currently one manager for a minimum of 50 rooms up to 145
   rooms and one manager for every 145 rooms thereafter based on the long-range DMP
   requirements).
   2.1.3. Manning will be primarily military to provide for mentoring and leadership
   responsibilities. At least one civilian authorization is appropriate for program continuity.
       2.1.3.1. As a minimum, designate a Master Sergeant or civilian equivalent as the UH
       Management Section Chief /UH Superintendent.
       2.1.3.2. As a minimum, designate one civilian as a UH Manager (if not as the UH
       Management Section Chief).
       2.1.3.3. All other UH Managers are limited to NCOs (Technical and Staff Sergeants).
   2.1.4. UH Managers must receive required training to be proficient in the tasks identified in
   the Air Force JQS for Dormitory Managers within 90 days after being appointed as a UH
   Manager (reference JQS 8H000).
   2.1.5. UH Managers will deploy in their primary Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). No
   more than 50 percent of the managers will be deployed at one time.
   2.1.6. Installations establish a UH Manager selection process. The Installation CCM
   monitors the status of UH Manager assignments to help provide program management
   stability, ensure assigned UH Managers receive the correct AFSC and assignment availability
   codes, and to program for replacements to ensure managers are in place when required. They
   participate in the UH Manager selection process.
2.2. Unit Integrity. Unit integrity is required in dormitories at all installations to promote
esprit-de-corps, camaraderie and buddy care among squadron members. The Commander
approves space allocation for individual squadrons based on rooms being located in the same
dormitory facility, on the same wing or floor and grouped together. Where space is not available
AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012                                                             15


in a single dormitory for an individual squadron, group together additional required rooms in the
nearest dormitory.
2.3. Space Allocation:
   2.3.1. The UH Management Section Chief monitors space allocation and recommends
   changes to the Housing Asset Manager. At minimum, a thorough assessment must be
   accomplished semiannually. The Commander approves space reallocation adjustments.
       2.3.1.1. Reallocate existing inventory to maintain 95 percent utilization in each UH
       facility.
       2.3.1.2. The Commander authorizes redistribution of required UH space based on a
       squadron population of Priority 1 and 2 unaccompanied personnel.
   2.3.2. Eligible members are assigned to rooms identified for use by their squadron.
       2.3.2.1. If a room is unavailable in the squadron allocated space for an arriving member,
       assign member to a hospitality room or another squadron space until a room becomes
       available.
       2.3.2.2. Moves resulting from space reallocation or to apply unit integrity are considered
       government-directed. Members directed to relocate are authorized a government-funded
       move and reimbursed services reconnection fees.
2.4. Utilization:
   2.4.1. The minimum Air Force standard for utilization of permanent party dormitory,
   UNCOQ and UOQ facilities for Priority 1 and 2 personnel is 95 percent. Optimum utilization
   is 95 percent for all priorities.
   2.4.2. Do not authorize BAH for E1s through E3s and E4s with less than 3 YOS unless
   overall base-wide 95 percent utilization is maintained. Authorize BAH based on UH
   assignment priorities.
   2.4.3. Dormitory facilities no longer needed to house Priority 1 and 2 personnel are
   considered surplus. Identify surplus dormitories and take action to remove facilities from the
   UH inventory IAW the base DMP (Paragraph 2.6).
       2.4.3.1. If 95 percent utilization cannot be maintained in each dormitory, UNCOQ or
       UOQ for 2 consecutive quarters, the Commander must establish a get-well plan. An
       explanation regarding this circumstance must be submitted with the base quarterly UH
       metric along with the get-well plan and estimated completion date.
       2.4.3.2. If 95 percent utilization cannot be maintained for four consecutive quarters (1
       year), the Commander must reallocate the existing inventory to meet 95 percent
       utilization and remove surplus rooms from the inventory.
   2.4.4. Utilization of pipeline (non-prior service members) facilities or rooms used to house
   pipeline students are not included in installation utilization rate for Priorities 1 and 2.
2.5. Diversions:
   2.5.1. The total base-wide diversions cannot exceed two percent of the base inventory.
   Diversions included in the two percent threshold are:
 16                                                 AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012


      2.5.1.1. Divert rooms anticipated to be unavailable for less than 90 days due to the
      accomplishment of minor repairs or COM. These diversions are included in the two
      percent diversion cap and in the utilization rate calculation.
      2.5.1.2. Divert rooms anticipated to be unavailable for individual assignment due to use
      as UH management administrative offices, storage space, hospitality rooms, or first
      sergeant rooms. These diversions are included in the two percent diversion cap but
      excluded in the utilization rate calculation.
      2.5.1.3. Divert rooms for use by pipeline students in facilities other than pipeline student
      dormitories. These diversions are excluded from the two percent diversion cap and the
      utilization rate calculated separately.
      2.5.1.4. Divert rooms for major repairs or renovations (structural, plumbing, electrical
      repairs or renovation work such as bath fixtures, window and door replacement, or
      complete refurbishment). These diversions are excluded from the two percent diversion
      cap and excluded in the utilization rate calculation.
   2.5.2. Report diverted rooms on the quarterly UH metric as appropriate. Conditions related
   to the diversion of rooms for more than 4 consecutive quarters should be assessed and
   consideration given to initiating action to surplus these facilities.
2.6. Change-In-Use of Surplus Unaccompanied Housing (UH):
   2.6.1. MAJCOMs approve permanent changes in use of surplus UH facilities, maintaining
   the integrity of the DMP (AFI 32-9002, Use of Real Property Facilities).
      2.6.1.1. The Commander and MAJCOM civil engineer must take a proactive,
      coordinated approach to identify and determine the disposition of surplus dormitories to
      maintain sound dormitory investment strategies.
      2.6.1.2. Consider the DMP, specifically the Area Development Plan, force protection
      (FP) concerns and building conditions, when determining surplus dormitory facilities.
   2.6.2. Surplus dormitory facilities may be permanently converted to another function, leased
   for enhanced use or demolished.
      2.6.2.1. In CONUS, surplus dormitory facilities (721-312) may be converted to
      UNCOQs (721-314) and offered to members in grades E4 with 3 YOS or higher on a
      space-available basis (Priority 3 and 4) if base anticipates that 95 percent occupancy rate
      can be maintained.
      2.6.2.2. In OCONUS, surplus dormitory facilities may be converted to UNCOQs (721-
      314) or UOQs (724-415) and offered on a space available basis if base anticipates that 95
      percent occupancy rate can be maintained.
      2.6.2.3. If converted to UOQs or UNCOQs, use base operations and maintenance
      (O&M) funds to maintain and/or upgrade. Apply the Air Force UH Design Guide
      standards and management practices for facility upgrades.
   2.6.3. Ensure appropriate approval documents are obtained and real property records
   adjusted for surplus dormitory facilities to include the application of the UOQ and UNCOQs
   real property accounting codes. AFI 32-9002, AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air
   Force Real Property; AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property; and AFI 32-9005, Real
AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012                                                                 17


   Property Accountability and Reporting, apply to managing disposition of surplus
   dormitories.
2.7. Unaccompanied Housing (UH) Metric. The UH metric is the Air Force tool for
determining utilization of UH facilities, providing justification for space reallocation, authorizing
BAH, managing change of occupancy timelines and supporting construction and renovation of
assets. Installations and MAJCOMs accomplish reporting requirements IAW latest AF/A7CAH
guidance.
   2.7.1. The UH Management Section Chief maintains daily auditable occupancy records for
   all UH facilities, accomplishes the UH quarterly metric as of 31 Mar, 30 Jun, 30 Sep and 31
   Dec each calendar year and forwards to the MAJCOM.
   2.7.2. MAJCOM consolidates installation quarterly UH metrics and forwards to HQ
   USAF/A7CAH by 5 May, 5 Aug, 5 Nov and 5 Feb each calendar year.
2.8. Tenant and Attached Unit Support. The host base provides UH support to eligible tenant
and attached unit personnel, when possible.
   2.8.1. Require support agreements IAW AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Requirements, if a
   unit or element of one MAJCOM is located on or near an installation of another command.
   Require inter-service support agreements if units of another service are located on or near an
   Air Force installation.
   2.8.2. Host base UH policy prevails where policy conflicts between tenant and host unit.
   The host base is the approving authority for tenant and attached unit UH BAH authorizations.
2.9. Training Facilities:
   2.9.1. Recruit Housing and Training (RH&T). Housing facilities to accommodate basic
   enlisted military training are located at Lackland AFB. These facilities are not administered
   by UH Managers.
   2.9.2. Non-Prior Service Student Housing (Pipeline). UH facilities constructed to support
   initial skills training for pipeline students are located at Lackland, Sheppard, Goodfellow and
   Keesler. These facilities are not administered by UH Managers. Refer to AETC Instruction
   36-2216, Administration of Military Standards and Discipline Training, for guidance
   regarding these facilities.
   2.9.3. Officer Training School (OTS). Housing facilities constructed to support OTS are
   located at Maxwell AFB. These facilities are not administered by UH Managers.
   2.9.4. Unaccompanied Officer Quarters (UOQs). Housing facilities used to support
   officer training other than OTS are administered by the UH Managers using this AFI.
   2.9.5. Cadet Dormitories. Housing facilities to accommodate United States Air Force
   Academy cadets are located at the Academy. These facilities are not administered by UH
   Managers.
2.10. Leased and Contract Housing. The Commander may lease or contract for UH facilities
for Priority 1 and 2 personnel when adequate government-owned quarters are unavailable (IAW
AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property).
 18                                                   AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012


   2.10.1. Use leasing to fill a long-term and stable UH requirement and a contract arrangement
   to fill a short-term or fluctuating need.
   2.10.2. Leased and contract UH is government-controlled housing and must meet the
   minimum adequacy standards.
   2.10.3. Manage leased and contract UH according to this instruction.
   2.10.4. Use O&M funds (XX679F) for lease and contract costs. Verify availability of O&M
   funds before entering into leases and contracts, and limit costs to basic rent, utilities and
   furnishings support unless otherwise approved by the MAJCOM.
   2.10.5. Initiate appropriate actions to stop entitlements to BAH, including partial BAH, for
   personnel assigned to leased or contract UH when the cost to the government exceeds the
   member’s BAH or Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA).
   2.10.6. Do not lease or contract UH if:
       2.10.6.1. There is less than 95 percent utilization by Priority 1 and 2 personnel of
       adequate on-base UH.
       2.10.6.2. Priority 3 and 4 personnel occupy adequate on-base UH.
       2.10.6.3. Adequate government quarters, controlled by other Air Force installations or
       other Services within the local commuting distance are available through a host-tenant,
       inter-service support or other agreement.
       2.10.6.4. Adequate and affordable private community housing is available.
       2.10.6.5. Competent authorities deem quarters unsafe through a climate assessment.
       2.10.6.6. Excess Temporary Lodging Facilities (TLF) are available.
2.11. Dormitory Councils. The Commander establishes dormitory councils to ensure each
dormitory resident has an opportunity to be responsible, accountable and involved in their living
conditions.
   2.11.1. The Airmen Dormitory Council is the forum by which residents of an individual
   dormitory address their concerns about their living environment with a panel of their peers,
   establish standards for all residents, present solutions for problem areas, establish positive
   recreational activities and identify facility and furnishings improvements. The goals of the
   council should include:
       2.11.1.1. Developing a spirit of camaraderie and esprit-de-corps.
       2.11.1.2. Improving QoL for residents.
       2.11.1.3. Instilling a sense of home ownership to residents.
       2.11.1.4. Enhancing the responsibility of residents.
       2.11.1.5. Encouraging teamwork for the accomplishment of goals.
       2.11.1.6. Resolving resident issues at the lowest level.
   2.11.2. Installation Dormitory Council is the forum that serves as the communication link
   between the Airmen Dormitory Councils and wing leadership to promote and garner support
   for improving dormitory life for all residents. The goals of the council should include:
AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012                                                            19


       2.11.2.1. Improving QoL for all dormitory residents
       2.11.2.2. Addressing concerns/issues associated with dormitory living environments.
       2.11.2.3. Empowering dormitory residents to be responsible and accountable for
       occupancy standards and living conditions.
       2.11.2.4. Gathering information and advising leadership about the ―Health of Dormitory
       Life‖.
       2.11.2.5. Acquiring support from the Commander for initiatives proposed by the Airmen
       Dormitory Councils.
   2.11.3. Membership for Airmen Dormitory Councils includes all residents of the dormitory.
   Advisors should include first sergeants, UH Managers and bay chiefs (if applicable).
   2.11.4. Membership for the Installation Dormitory Council include the Installation CCM as
   the Chairperson, all Chairpersons or Vice-chairpersons of the individual Airmen Dormitory
   Councils, first sergeants, Housing Asset Manager, UH Management Section Chief and UH
   Managers.
2.12. Charge of Quarters (CQ). If the Commander determines that a CQ program is required,
develop CQ procedures to provide for security, control building and room entry, escort official
visitors and facilitate emergency response. Squadron commanders and first sergeants provide
manning and oversight to support a CQ program.
2.13. Dormitory Inspection Program. The Commander establishes a base-wide dormitory
inspection program focused on safety and health. Squadron Commanders (may be delegated to
first sergeant) implement the inspection program to ensure the residents from their squadron
comply with installation standards.
2.14. Bay Orderly Program. The bay orderly program is comprised of residents detailed by
individual units to perform required duties that ensure cleanliness standards of UH campus
common areas are maintained. Installations establish a bay orderly program based on local
requirements. Squadron commanders or first sergeants schedule and assign bay orderlies for
duty as required. The UH Management Section provides overall program management and
supervises residents performing these functions. Attachment 5 provides a sample bay orderly
checklist.
2.14. (AFSPC)Bay Orderly Program. It is the responsibility of the Base Civil Engineer and
Capital Asset Manager to ensure bay orderlies perform activities consistent with the sample
checklist at Attachment 5. Additionally, this program has been added by HQAF/A7C to the HAF
Core Checklist for Housing as an area to be assessed during IG Unit Compliance Inspections. To
ensure the effectiveness of this program a four-fold improvement plan includes:
   2.14.1. (Added-AFSPC) Installation civil engineering and asset management flight
   emphasis on the importance of the program when communicating with installation
   commanders, command chiefs, squadron commanders, base engineers, first sergeants, and
   Airmen Dorm Leaders.
   2.14.2. (Added-AFSPC) Those assigned to bay orderly duties are not to be detailed to other
   duties (including but not limited to: moving furniture, perform contract escort, construction
   clean-up, self-help, and other non-bay orderly duties).
 20                                                  AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012


   2.14.3. (Added-AFSPC) Elements of the Bay Orderly Program (i.e., attendance) should be
   added into measurement criteria for dormitory awards at AFSPC installations with a local
   awards program.
   2.14.4. (Added-AFSPC) Performance of the Bay Orderly Program must be added as a
   continuing discussion item during Installation Dormitory Councils.
2.15. Quarters Improvement Committee (QIC) and Quarters Improvement Plan
(QIP): Refer to AFI 32-6004 for QIC and QIP policy.
   2.15.1. QIC. The QIC is the installation primary forum for identifying facility and
   requirements for permanent party unaccompanied and transient personnel. The QIC reviews
   the annual UH inventory, use, requirements and standards. The QIC ensures that UH facility
   and furnishings requirements are maintained, renovated and replaced on a timely basis by
   following a QIP. The UH Management Section Chief participates on the QIC, ensure
   updates are included and advocates for specific UH facility and furnishings requirements.
       2.15.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) The UH Manager will brief the following topics at the QIC:
       status of dorm quarters improvement efforts, recommendation of funds distribution,
       future facility and/or furnishing projects for acceptability and compatibility with interior
       design goals, base dormitory standard based on the AFSPC Comprehensive Interior
       Design Package for Dormitories, furnishing warranty status and issues, results of annual
       furnishing and appliance condition assessment, results of room and furnishing
       ROS/damage collections, and the status of ACES-FMO implementation and records
       upkeep.
   2.15.2. QIP. The QIP is a 5-year facility and furnishings requirements plan that documents
   all elements of UH facility living environments to include standards for the facility,
   furnishings, interior design, decorative themes, privacy, recreation, leisure, convenience,
   storage, parking and security. The QIP, approved by the QIC, includes budget inputs for the
   current fiscal years and the next four fiscal years. The UH Management Section Chief
   identifies UH facility and furnishings requirements to the Furnishings Management Office
   (FMO) for inclusion in the annual QIP.
2.16. Resident Liability. Residents are liable for loss or damage to UH, equipment and
furnishings caused by abuse or negligence of the residents or their guests and for failure to
satisfactorily clean an assigned room upon termination (10 U.S.C. § 2775).
   2.16.1. The UH Management Section Chief makes the initial determination whether or not
   the resident is responsible for the abuse or negligence, informs the resident of their liability
   and ensure the costs of damage are collected.
   2.16.2. The UH Management Section Chief notifies the Housing Asset Manager of the need
   for an ROS when the member does not accept liability or the damage is valued at over $500
   (AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property). The Housing Asset Manager
   requests the BCE initiate an ROS to determine liability. Financial liability is determined
   IAW 10 U.S.C. § 2775 and DoD 7000.14R Volume 2, Chapter 7.
       2.16.2.1. Ensure member reimburses government for responsible costs sufficient to cover
       necessary repairs, replacements or cleaning. Authority to deduct charges from a military
       member’s pay is in 10 U.S.C. § 2775. Salary offset for civilian employees is authorized
AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012                                                              21


       in DoD 7000.14R Volume 8 (Civilian Pay).               Notify member prior to taking
       reimbursement actions.
       2.16.2.2. Credit the amount collected for loss or damage to UH facilities and furnishings
       to the installation O&M account for UH PE xx679.
2.17. Automated Civil Engineer System (ACES). ACES-HM is the Air Force Civil Engineer
standard management software for managing family housing (FH) and UH.
   2.17.1. ACES is one of the tools used to plan, advocate, program, design and execute UH
   requirements.
   2.17.2. UH management is required to utilize the existing Air Force automation system to
   perform daily operations. Installations may not fund or use other information systems when
   the functions exist in ACES.
   2.17.3. Reporting and data extraction (mining) occur at every level of command and the
   assumption is that data in ACES-HM is accurate and reliable. It is critical that UH staffs at
   all locations use ACES-HM exclusively to record, manage, monitor and track the following:
       2.17.3.1. UH resident data, waiting lists, assignments into and termination from UH
       facilities and diversions.
       2.17.3.2. Inspection schedules and results for UH rooms.
       2.17.3.3. Drayage and storage authorizations and obligations.
2.18. Deployment. Residents will retain room assignments during deployment. Develop local
procedures to ensure rooms and personal property is inspected weekly for damages from local
climatic conditions, insects and intrusion.
   2.18.1. Members who will become eligible for BAH based on promotion during deployment
   may make arrangements in advance of their departure to terminate room assignment while
   deployed (paragraph 5.1.3.1.4).
2.19. Pregnant Member. Pregnant members at the 20th week of pregnancy, regardless of rank
or marital status, may submit a squadron commander approved request to the UH Management
Section Chief to relocate from UH to community housing. An earlier move may be requested if
deemed necessary by medical authority. The Commander may direct the move of pregnant
members from the 30th week of pregnancy until the date of birth. If a live birth does not occur,
or the child does not reside with the member after BAH is authorized (i.e., adoption, resides with
others relatives, etc.) paragraph 4.2 applies
   2.19.1. Air Force FH policy allows a single pregnant member to apply for government FH
   60 days prior to the expected delivery date. The member may not be assigned government
   FH until member is entitled to BAH at the with-dependent rate. If excess FH is available it
   may be temporarily diverted to UH (approval authority is MAJCOM) which allows the single
   pregnant member to occupy the unit 60 days prior to the anticipated delivery date (AFI 32-
   6001, paragraph. 3.1.4). Ensure FH funds are used for all costs associated with the
   temporary diversion to UH. Before assignment in OCONUS areas, the member must
   provide evidence of application for command sponsorship and tour extension as an
   accompanied member.
 22                                                AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012


   2.19.2. Temporarily diverted FH to UH for occupancy by a single pregnant member must be
   converted back to FH upon the live birth of the child and the establishment of BAH at the
   with-dependent rate.
2.20. Social Visits. The Commander establishes local policy regarding social visits. At
minimum, guests must be at least 18 years old, be escorted at all times and are prohibited
between hours 2400 – 0600 hours. Cohabitation is not authorized.
2.21. Smoking. Smoking is permitted in UH rooms but prohibited in common areas.
   2.21.1. The Commander may designate the entire UH facility as nonsmoking, if necessary,
   to eliminate second-hand smoke exposure. If UH facilities are designated as nonsmoking,
   commanders make provisions for smokers through a segregated area with separate
   ventilation.
   2.21.2. Reference AFI 40-102, Tobacco Use in the Air Force, and seek assistance from base
   environmental health technicians if air quality measurement is required.
2.22. Sex Offender Policy. The Commander establishes disclosure processes for persons
assigned to or applying for unaccompanied housing who are sex offenders. Commanders must
ensure all current residents comply with the requirements for disclosure and determine
appropriate actions based on results of disclosure. Compliance is mandatory, except in foreign
countries where compliance will be determined by the MAJCOM/CC based on host-nation
requirements and sensitivities.      See AFI 32-6001, Family Housing Management, for
implementation guidance.

           UNACCOMPANIED HOUSING (UH) ADEQUACY STANDARDS

3.1. Unaccompanied Housing (UH) Standards Philosophy. UH provides the space, privacy
and furnishings required for comfortable living. Adequacy standards apply to government-
owned or government-controlled UH unless otherwise specified by contract or lease between the
Air Force and a private contractor. Use Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 to determine whether UH is
adequate to involuntarily assign personnel to on-base UH. When the Commander determines
existing on-base UH is not adequate, permanent party members may reside off base with
allowances.
   3.1.1. UH standards are established to support the mission and maintain QoL for
   unaccompanied residents. No authority is provided to exceed Air Force standards included
   in this chapter.
       3.1.1.1. Commanders must ensure all residents are assigned a single private
       sleeping/living room before divesting or changing the use of UH facilities.
       3.1.1.2. Do not establish local criteria that would result in increased BAH, OHA or
       O&M expenditures.
       3.1.1.3. Maintaining surplus inventory to assign Airmen to multiple private
       sleeping/living rooms is not authorized.
   3.1.2. Tables 3.1 and 3.2 establish Air Force adequacy standards for existing UH inventory
   constructed or converted in FY95 and earlier (2+2 construction standard) and for inventory
   constructed or converted between FY96 and FY02 (1+1 construction standard). Dormitories
   constructed or renovated in FY03 and beyond must be constructed to the Dorms-4-Airmen
   standard (Table 3.3).

3.2. Adequacy Standards for Constrained Housing Locations. In areas where the installation
Housing Requirements and Market Analysis (HRMA) justifies a deficit of adequate and
affordable off-base housing for any portion of unaccompanied E-4 with over 3 YOS through E-9
personnel and officers, the MAJCOM/CC may designate the affected grades of unaccompanied
personnel as Priority 2, space required. Installations should program to build UH for the
affected grades as outlined in their base DMP. At these installations, grades affected in the
HRMA will be housed on base at the appropriate standard provided in Table 3.1, Table 3.2 or
Table 3.3.
3.3. Exceptions to Adequacy Standards. The Commander may reduce adequacy standards for
a period not to exceed (NTE) 30 days for reasons of military necessity or to satisfy mission
needs. For periods exceeding 30 days, the MAJCOM Civil Engineer is the approval authority
and must provide written approval to the installation before standards are reduced. MAJCOMs
notify HQ USAF/A7CAH in writing of the approval and include the basis for reducing
standards, the estimated get-well date and plan of action to correct. At AETC Technical
Training Centers the Commander may approve the waiver for a period NTE 120 days. Periods
beyond 120 consecutive days require MAJCOM CE approval.
      3.3.1. For AETC student training dormitories, the Commander may reduce adequacy
      standards for a period NTE 30 days for reasons of military necessity or to satisfy mission
      needs. For periods exceeding 30 days, NAF/CC must provide written approval to the base
      before standards are reduced. Send notification to HQ USAF/A7CA and HQ AETC/A7C
      and include the basis for reducing the standards, the corrective action plan and estimated get-
      well date.

3.4. Non-Air Force Installations. When Air Force personnel are assigned to an Army, Navy or
Marine Corps installation, host installation service adequacy standards apply, except where
otherwise provided for in an official support agreement.
3.5. Unaccompanied Housing (UH) Programming Criteria. To ensure MAJCOMs and bases
appropriately plan, program and budget for UH requirements, the Air Force uses a master
planning process. The plan quantifies projected UH requirements, captures facility data,
identifies deficits and requirements for replacement and provides recommendations and cost
estimates for each installation UH program. For current dormitory programming information,
see the latest Air Force DMP and AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements.
3.6. Unaccompanied Housing (UH) Design Guidance. For UH design guidance, refer to the
Air Force Unaccompanied Housing Design Guide.

                   ELIGIBILITY, ASSIGNMENT AND TERMINATION

4.1. Eligibility. The following categories of personnel are eligible for assignment to UH:
   4.1.1. Military Members. Permanent party unaccompanied personnel who are on active
   duty.
       4.1.1.1. Members with dependents, separated for 30 days or less awaiting arrival of
       family members, are not authorized to be assigned UH or reside in UH temporary
       accommodations. These members must reside off base or in lodging.
       4.1.1.2. Members who are on temporary duty (TDY) and authorized per diem are not
       authorized to reside in UH facilities.
   4.1.2. Civilian Personnel. Civilian personnel (defined in Attachment 1, Terms) are
   expected to rely on the civilian community for housing. Commanders may provide housing
   to eligible civilians as follows:
       4.1.2.1. In CONUS (Alaska and Hawaii), civilians are only eligible for UH if required to
       live on base for reasons of military necessity, as determined by the Commander.
           4.1.2.1.1. Positions should be identified in the base supplement to AFI 32-6001.
           4.1.2.1.2. Members are required to pay fair market rental rate (paragraph 5.5.).
       4.1.2.2. Civilians may be provided UH in OCONUS and non-foreign OCONUS (other
       than Alaska and Hawaii), when appropriate and adequate housing, support services and
       facilities do not exist, are not readily available in the local community or may not be used
       without restrictions (DoD 1400.6-D, DoD Civilian Employees in Overseas Areas) or
       when housing is excess to the needs of military personnel assigned or attached to the
       installation or adjacent installation (5 U.S.C. § 5911).
           4.1.2.2.1. Eligible civilians authorized LQA funded with APF, who are offered and
           accept UH, are not authorized to continue to receive LQA. The UH Manager
           provides formal notification to the servicing CPO and/or tenant agency when a
           civilian employee is assigned to UH so LQA can be terminated. No further charges
           are required by the civilian employee or their agency.
           4.1.2.2.2. Eligible civilians not authorized LQA funded with APF, who are offered
           and accept UH, must pay a monthly rental charge based on the established LQA rate
           of the equivalent grade. This rental charge is a reimbursement to the UH O&M
           account (see AFI 65-601, Section 10K).
           4.1.2.2.3. Eligibility for housing is limited to 5 years occupancy at any location,
           except for key and essential (K&E) civilians. When there is a waiting list, issue 60-
           day mandatory termination notices to those who have occupied UH for 5 years or
           longer. When local community housing is adequate or sufficient to house civilians, at
           the Commander’s discretion, issue termination notices to civilians who have occupied
           UH for 5 years or longer.
AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012                                                           29


  4.1.3. US Coast Guard, US Public Health Service and National Oceanic and
  Atmospheric Administration. Unaccompanied personnel from these agencies may be
  assigned UH using priorities determined by the Commander. Normally, full-time
  unaccompanied personnel are assigned on the same basis as military members. Personnel are
  charged a rental rate equal to BAH of their equivalent grade (paragraph 5.5).
  4.1.4. Contractor Employees and Technical Representatives. Unaccompanied personnel
  are not authorized to apply for or be assigned UH unless designated K&E. Exceptions are
  approved by MAJCOMs. Personnel in OCONUS are charged a rental rate equivalent to the
  civilian LQA rate unless otherwise stated in the contract with the government. In CONUS,
  personnel are charged a fair market rental rate (paragraph 5.5).
  4.1.5. US Government, non-DoD personnel in foreign areas and US Territories and
  Trusts. Unaccompanied personnel are eligible for UH on a space-available basis or as stated
  in host country agreements. Personnel are charged a rental rate equivalent to the civilian
  LQA rate (paragraph 5.5).
  4.1.6. American Red Cross (ARC) Personnel. An unaccompanied ARC Regional
  Manager, Senior Station Manager, Station Manager and Assistant Manager may be assigned
  UH as follows:
     4.1.6.1. In CONUS and non-foreign OCONUS, ARC personnel are housed on the same
     basis as DoD civilians and pay a fair market rental rate (paragraph 5.5).
     4.1.6.2. In OCONUS, ARC personnel listed in Table 5.1 of AFI 32-6001 may be
     assigned UH without charge. All other ARC personnel are eligible on a space available
     basis and charged a rental rate equivalent to the civilian LQA rate (paragraph 5.5.)
  4.1.7. AFRC and ANG Personnel. Unaccompanied personnel (all grades) on active duty
  for training (school and annual tours) and for reasons other than training (man-days,
  activation, mobilization), as determined by the Commander at the permanent duty station
  (PDS). NOTE: The PDS for members of AFRC and ANG components ordered to active
  duty for training is the training location to which each member travels. The PDS for
  members ordered to active duty, other than for training, is their monthly drill or training
  station. The PDS for AFRC members who have no monthly drill or training station, i.e.,
  individual ready reserve, some individual mobilization augmentees, standby reservists, is the
  place from which they were called or ordered to active duty.
  4.1.8. Foreign Military Trainees (Foreign Military Sales Trainee, International
  Military Education and Trainee and Security Assistance Trainee). Unaccompanied
  members are eligible for UH on a space-available basis, or as stated in official agreements.
  Personnel are not required to pay a rental charge (paragraph 5.5).
  4.1.9. Foreign Exchange Personnel. Unaccompanied members are eligible for UH on the
  same basis as US military personnel. Personnel must pay rent equal to BAH of their
  equivalent grade (paragraph 5.5).
  4.1.10. Foreign Liaison Personnel. Unaccompanied members are eligible for UH on a
  space-available basis. Personnel must pay rent equal to BAH of their equivalent grade or as
  specified in the current agreement between the United States Government and the Foreign
  Government (paragraph 5.5).

   4.1.11. Non-US Citizen Personnel. Unaccompanied members are eligible for UH on a
   space available basis. Personnel must pay rent equal to BAH of their equivalent grade, equal
   to the civilian LQA or as specified in the current agreement between the United States
   Government and the Foreign Government (paragraph 5.5).
4.2. Assignment Priorities. Assign unaccompanied personnel to UH according to the following
priorities.
   4.2.1. Priority 1, Space Required. Personnel (all grades) required to live on base for
   reasons of military necessity, readiness (to include FP), training mission, or discipline,
   including unmarried and unaccompanied married incumbents of designated K&E positions
   and members with a bonafide hardship as determined by the Commander (para 1.2.2.7).
      4.2.1.1. Pipeline students who are not authorized per diem or BAH are considered
      Priority 1.
      4.2.1.2. E4 personnel who attain over 3 YOS and have less than 6 months remaining on
      station due to permanent change of station (PCS) or separation, convert from Priority 2 to
      Priority 1 and are not authorized to relocate off base with BAH.
      4.2.1.3. K&E positions must be listed in the base supplement to AFI 32-6001.
      4.2.1.4. For hardship assignments, members initiate and submit a request with squadron
      commander endorsement to the UH Management Section Chief who processes the
      request to Housing Asset Manager with a recommendation. The Commander is authority
      for approval or disapproval and may delegate this authority no lower than the Mission
      Support Group Commander, or equivalent.
      4.2.1.5. Priority 1 personnel must be revalidated annually.
   4.2.2. Priority 2, Space Required. Beginning with the most junior member, Priority 2

      4.2.2.7. DELETED
   4.2.3. Priority 3, Space Available. Beginning with the most junior member, Priority 3
   includes:
AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012                                                             31


       4.2.3.1. Unmarried personnel in grades E-4 with 3 or more YOS through E-9.
       4.2.3.2. Unmarried officers in OCONUS locations with established UOQs.
   4.2.4. Priority 4, Space Available. Beginning with the most junior member, Priority 4
   includes unaccompanied personnel who are authorized with-dependent BAH but voluntarily
   separated from dependents:
       4.2.4.1. Unaccompanied personnel in grades E-1 to E-9.
       4.2.4.2. Unaccompanied officers in OCONUS locations with established UOQs.
4.3. Assignment Priorities in Constrained Housing Locations. When the HRMA reflects a
deficit of adequate, affordable and safe off-base housing to support unaccompanied members in
grades E-4 with 3 or more YOS through E-9 and officers at any location, the MAJCOM
commander designates the affected grades of unaccompanied personnel as Priority 2, space
required.
4.4. Waiting List. The UH Management Section manages waiting lists for assignment to and
termination from UH.
   4.4.1. Priority 1 members must have written approval from the Commander to relocate off
   base.
   4.4.2. Priority 2 waiting list for BAH. Maintain a base-wide BAH waiting list of Priority 2
   members desiring to relocate off base with BAH. Ensure local procedures require squadron
   commander and/or first sergeant approval prior to member notification of selection and
   authorizing BAH.
   4.4.3. Priority 2 waiting list for assignment to UH. Maintain a list of members waiting
   assignment to UH due to insufficient UH space in grades E1-E3 and E4s with less than 3
   YOS and others in approved constrained housing locations in the grades of E4s with 3 YOS
   through E9 and officers.
   4.4.4. Priority 3 and 4 waiting list for assignment to UH. Maintain a list of Priority 3 and 4
   members requesting assignment to UH on a space available basis.
4.5. Temporary Accommodations:
   4.5.1. Provide a hospitality room as temporary accommodations for unaccompanied eligible
   personnel arriving and departing during non-duty hours. Include designated rooms in the
   total rooms authorized for diversion but do not assign the member to the room.
       4.5.1.1. UH Manager notifies first sergeant or squadron commander when there is no
       available UH permanent party room or hospitality room for arriving eligible members, so
       arrangements can be made for temporary accommodations in lodging. Members eligible
       for UH and occupying lodging facilities pay the daily lodging fee.
   4.5.2. Installations may elect to use UH rooms to provide space for temporary
   accommodations for personnel involved in extraordinary situations (such as domestic
   altercations). Keep the number of rooms used for this purpose to an absolute minimum
   (minimum adequacy standards do not apply) and limit a member’s stay to no more than a
   total of 72 hours. Give special consideration to location within the dormitory campus for
   rooms designated for this purpose and furnish with only essential furniture (i.e. bed, chest).
 32                                               AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012


   Include designated rooms in the total rooms authorized for diversion but do not assign the
   member to the room.
      4.5.2.1. The UH Management Section Chief is responsible for the management of these
      rooms.
4.6. Assignment Criteria and Procedures. The Air Force assignment standard is one private
room for each permanent party Airman (E1 through E4 with less than 3 YOS). Exception: See
paragraph 3.3 for waiver authorities.
   4.6.1. Assignment Criteria:
      4.6.1.1. UH Manager assigns member to a private room, including UOQs and UNCOQs,
      as soon as possible after an eligible member arrives on the installation.
      4.6.1.2. Assign members to appropriate UH allocated for their squadron to ensure unit
      integrity.
      4.6.1.3. Authorize BAH to inbound Priority 2 members within 60 days of having 3 YOS
      so they may obtain off-base housing immediately upon arrival on station.
      4.6.1.4. E4s residing in dormitories reaching 3 YOS may voluntarily become a Priority 3
      and occupy a dormitory on a space-available basis without BAH (Exception: E4s in this
      category with less than 6 months remaining on station convert to Priority 1). If the
      government requires a move to another on-base facility, the move is at government
      expense. Voluntary moves to another on-base facility are at the member’s expense. Any
      subsequent move off base is at government expense.
      4.6.1.5. Priority 3 and 4 members relocating from off base into UH on a space-available
      basis, are not authorized a government-paid move. Lower grade members have
      precedence for space available assignment.
   4.6.2. Assignment Considerations.     When determining room assignments UH Managers
   must consider the following issues:
      4.6.2.1. Males and Females. Males and females may be assigned in the same facility, but
      must be housed in separate modules. A module is either a Dorms-4-Airmen four-room
      suite, or the two-room/one bathroom suite in the 1+1 and 2+2 dorms.
      4.6.2.2. Smokers and Non-smokers. Attempt to assign smokers with smokers and
      nonsmokers with nonsmokers considering UH room and module configurations. If a
      smoker and nonsmoker are assigned to the same room or module, the rights of the
      nonsmoker prevail. If a nonsmoker detects second-hand smoke, regardless of its source,
      the rights of the nonsmoker prevail.
   4.6.3. Assignment Procedures. UH Managers process assignment actions, including UOQs
   and UNCOQs. UH Managers must:
      4.6.3.1. Make assignments in writing using ACES-generated Unaccompanied Quarters
      Assignment-Termination Record (attachment 2). Ensure Priority 3 and 4 personnel
      acknowledge, in writing, that:
          4.6.3.1.1. They are occupying UH on a space-available basis and may be required to
          terminate quarters with 30 days notice.
AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012                                                              33


          4.6.3.1.2. Moves into and out of UH, including local drayage, nontemporary storage
          (NTS) of personal property and service reconnections (cable TV, telephone and
          internet) are at their own expense. Exception: Government-funded moves are
          authorized when space-available members are directed to move from an assigned on-
          base dormitory room to another on-base dormitory room for the convenience of the
          government for reasons such as major repairs, renovations and demolitions.
      4.6.3.2. Accomplish AF IMT 594, Application and Authorization to Start, Stop or
      Change Basic Allowance For Housing (BAH) or Dependency Redetermination for every
      UH assignment to include E1-E3 and E4with less than 3 YOS personnel.
      4.6.3.3. Perform an initial inspection of the UH facility and room with the resident.
      Ensure discrepancies are annotated in writing and acknowledged by the resident and the
      UH Manager (see sample checklist at Attachment 6).
      4.6.3.4. Provide a Resident Brochure identifying applicable Air Force, MAJCOM and
      local base standards (see sample Resident Brochure at Attachment 7).
      4.6.3.5. Issue and provide local cleaning policy for linens including bedspreads,
      draperies, sheets, blankets, etc.
      4.6.3.6. Perform an inventory and assessment of furnishings. Use AF Form 228 to issue
      and identify condition of room furnishings.
      4.6.3.7. Use locally developed checklists to ensure residents acknowledge receipt of the
      Resident Brochure, linens, condition of room and any other locally required information.
          4.6.3.7.1. Ensure members acknowledge in writing that they are required to reside in
          the assigned room provided unless otherwise approved by the first sergeant or
          commander.
      4.6.3.8. Maintain all UH records to include those related to determinations made by the
      Commander.
4.7. Involuntary Assignments. Involuntary assignments to UH are made when:
   4.7.1. Required for reasons of military necessity, readiness or discipline. This applies to all
   personnel and to adequate and inadequate quarters.
   4.7.2. Occupancy of adequate UH by Priority 1 and 2 personnel is below 95 percent
   utilization.
      4.7.2.1. Involuntary assignments in CONUS and OCONUS apply to all Priority 1 and 2
      personnel and those grade groups identified in constrained location approval. Make
      assignments beginning with the most junior member.
      4.7.2.2. Provide members 30 days advance written notice of an involuntary assignment.
   4.7.3. Make every effort to fill UH vacancies with newly arrived personnel. If projected
   unaccompanied personnel gains will not increase the utilization rate to 95 percent within 120
   days, the Commander must recall Priority 1 and 2 personnel previously authorized to live off
   base and receive BAH. (Priority 1 and 2 personnel residing off-base when Interim Change 1
   was issued may be involuntary assigned to UH if the utilization rate falls below 90 percent.)
   Moves are at government expense.
 34                                                 AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012


   4.7.4. Unless required for military necessity, readiness or discipline, do not involuntarily
   assign personnel in grades E-1 to E-3 and E-4s with less than 3 YOS, under the following
   conditions:
      4.7.4.1. Member has official notification to depart the installation PCS.
      4.7.4.2. After the death of a sole family member.
      4.7.4.3. A military married to military couple resides off base. One spouse is reassigned
      to another base and one remains at the original location.
      4.7.4.4. The Commander determines that a member will experience a hardship. (For
      example, member made permanent off-base housing arrangement; requires the sale of a
      home; or requires financial penalties resulting from the terms of existing lease.)
   4.7.5. Civilian employees may not be involuntarily assigned to occupy on-base quarters,
   except when required by military necessity or FP. If the civilian employee refuses
   permanent, adequate, available on-base housing in foreign countries and US overseas areas
   (DoD 1400.25-M, Department of Defense Civilian Personnel Manual (CPM), Chapter 592,
   Overseas Allowances and Differentials), LQA is not authorized for off-base housing.
4.8. Termination Criteria and Procedures. UH Managers process termination actions for all
UH to include UOQs and UNCOQs. UH Managers must:
   4.8.1. Terminate UH assignments in writing when:
      4.8.1.1. A member departs PCS or ends active military service or civilian employment.
      4.8.1.2. A member becomes eligible for BAH (both with and without dependent rate)
      and authorized by proper authority to reside off base.
          4.8.1.2.1. An E4 residing in a dormitory reaches 3 YOS regardless of the utilization
          rate (unless they have less than 6 months remaining on station). The UH Manager, in
          coordination with commanders/first sergeants, validates rank and time in service for
          E4s before processing BAH.
          4.8.1.2.2. Space is required for a member in a higher priority (over 95 percent
          utilization).
      4.8.1.3. A member who voluntarily occupies UH (space available) requests termination.
      4.8.1.4. When a military or civilian member is away from their PDS and status is
      changed to deceased, missing in action, captured or detained by the enemy, use
      procedures identified in AFI 34-244, Disposition of Personal Property, for protection of
      personal property. Direct a move for members who are on extended confinement
      or absent without leave (AWOL).
      4.8.1.5. To provide needed space for Priority 1 and 2 personnel. Use the following
      guidelines:
          4.8.1.5.1. Terminate Priority 4 and then Priority 3 personnel, senior member first.
          4.8.1.5.2. Authorize BAH to Priority 2 personnel (all grades) on the BAH waiting
          list, senior member first, when utilization of total space required (Priority 1 and 2)
          personnel exceeds 95 percent.
AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012                                                           35


  4.8.2. Termination of assigned dormitory room is accomplished in two phases:
     4.8.2.1. Prefinal Inspection. UH Manager conducts the prefinal inspection in advance
     (generally 30 to 45 days) of member vacating UH.
         4.8.2.1.1. Provide residents written cleaning standards used for final inspection (see
         sample cleaning standards at Attachment 3 which may be adjusted to meet local base
         needs).
         4.8.2.1.2. Assess condition of assigned rooms/shared common space and furnishings
         as compared to discrepancies noted at the initial inspection to determine damages or
         loss. Provide members detailed written information regarding financial liabilities and
         include alternatives for restitution and/or repair as soon as possible to ensure
         requirements are accomplished before final inspection.
         4.8.2.1.3. Identify COM requirements (see Attachment 4, Sample COM checklist).
     4.8.2.2. Final Inspection. Ensure resident meets cleaning standards established by the
     Commander and the room is cleared of personal property. Allow resident to correct
     minor items during the final inspection. If the unit fails inspection, schedule a
     reinspection at the earliest mutually acceptable time to minimize delay of resident
     departure.
         4.8.2.2.1. After a successful final inspection, the UH Manager initiates and issues
         ACES-generated Unaccompanied Quarters Assignment-Termination Record
         certifying termination.
         4.8.2.2.2. UH Manager prepares AF IMT 594 and processes as required.
         4.8.2.2.3. If member is relocating off base, BAH is not authorized until a successful
         final inspection is completed.
  4.8.3. Change of Occupancy Maintenance (COM). During the prefinal inspection, the UH
  Manager identifies maintenance required to make the unit ready for the next resident (see
  sample COM checklist at Attachment 4 which may be adjusted to meet local base needs).
  Identify items for repair or replacement on AF Form 1219, BCE Multi-Craft Job Order, and
  forward to CE customer service or contractor for action (or use locally established forms and
  procedures).
     4.8.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) COM Requirements are to be considered ―urgent‖ work (7
     calendar day timeframe), as defined in AFI 32-1001.

                                          Chapter 5

                                  FINANCIAL MATTERS

5.1. Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). An unaccompanied member’s entitlement to BAH
may be affected by assignment to UH [Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) Chapter 10,
U103064].
   5.1.1. Unaccompanied personnel assigned to UH are authorized partial BAH. Partial BAH
   is not authorized when members occupy leased or contract quarters which cost more than
   BAH, plus OHA. The FSO automatically starts partial BAH for unaccompanied members
   not authorized without-dependent BAH.
   5.1.2. Unaccompanied personnel are authorized to live off base and receive single rate BAH
   when dormitory, UNCOQ and UOQ utilization of Priority 1 and 2 personnel exceeds 95
   percent. Members, with approval by the first sergeant or squadron commander, are eligible to
   apply for the BAH waiting list.
      5.1.2.1. Personnel who voluntarily live off base without BAH are not automatically the
      most eligible and must compete with other members on the BAH waiting list to receive
      BAH.
      5.1.2.2. The UH Management Section maintains a single BAH waiting list system by
      seniority. The waiting list system must ensure equitable allocation of dormitory space
      among squadrons and minimize frequent dormitory resident moves. The UH
      Management Section Chief should monitor individual dormitory utilization rates, advise
      asset manager when individual facilities are causing the base-wide dormitory utilization
      rate to fall below 95 percent and recommend space reallocation or change in use.
          5.1.2.2.1. Single base-wide BAH waiting list. When a single base-wide BAH
          waiting list adversely impacts unit integrity or causes hardship to unaccompanied
          Airmen by forcing frequent moves among dorms, the Commander may authorize
          BAH waiting lists by individual facility (dormitory) or unit.
          5.1.2.2.2. Facility (dormitory) or unit BAH waiting list. If the base-wide utilization
          rate is greater than 95 percent and the dormitory rate of a specific dorm is below 95
          percent utilization, do not issue BAH until that dormitory rate exceeds 95 percent.
   5.1.3. There are conditions when unaccompanied personnel are authorized to live off base
   with allowances, regardless of the utilization rate or availability of government quarters, as
   long as the Commander does not require them to live on base for reasons of military
   necessity, readiness, or discipline. The following moves from UH to off base are at
   government expense.
      5.1.3.1. Personnel (without dependent family members anywhere) in grades E-4 with 3
      YOS and above.
          5.1.3.1.1. Inbound E-4 members within 60 days of attaining 3 YOS will be
          authorized BAH and must obtain off-base housing immediately upon arrival on
          station.
AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012                                                            37


        5.1.3.1.2. E4s attaining 3 YOS will not be authorized to move off base with BAH if
        they have less than 6 months remaining on station prior to PCS or separation from the
        Air Force unless the move meets requirements in paragraph 5.1.3.4, 5.1.3.6 or 5.1.3.8.
        5.1.3.1.3. Normally, BAH for newly assigned members in grades E-4 with 3 YOS
        and above will continue from their last duty station; however, if necessary, the local
        FSO starts BAH during in-processing once the member has certified non-occupancy
        of government quarters.
        5.1.3.1.4. Airmen who will become eligible for BAH as a result of promotion during
        a deployment may make arrangements to out-process prior to departure. Another
        military member, with a valid power of attorney, may terminate UH on behalf of the
        deployed member on the date he/she becomes eligible for the entitlement. Airmen,
        who chose to move off base and/or store the contents prior to that date, must do so at
        their own expense and with approval from the First Sergeant or Squadron
        Commander. The UH Management Section Chief will process an AF IMT 594 only
        when the member is eligible and the room is cleared IAW with local policies.
     5.1.3.2. Personnel with a hardship may submit a unit commander-endorsed request to
     reside in community housing and receive BAH based on a hardship condition to the UH
     Management Section Chief for coordination.
        5.1.3.2.1. The Commander is the approval authority for a hardship request.
            5.1.3.2.1.1. A hardship can be described as a unique and unusual circumstance
            that, in the judgment of the Commander, imposes an extraordinary burden on a
            member not normally encountered by other members of similar grade at that
            installation.
        5.1.3.2.2. The UH Management Section Chief provides a recommendation to
        Housing Asset Manager who then forwards the request to the Commander for
        approval/disapproval.
        5.1.3.2.3. The member must provide annual recertification to the UH Management
        Section Chief to continue the entitlement.
     5.1.3.3. Personnel with privately owned mobile homes moved from the previous duty
     station to the new duty station at government expense (authorized in PCS orders).
     Members with privately owned mobile homes may submit a request to reside in the
     community and receive BAH. The request must include a copy of the authorization to
     move the mobile home to the new duty station at government expense.
     5.1.3.4. Pregnant women residing in UH. Pregnant women, regardless of rank or marital
     status, may submit a unit commander-approved request to the UH Management Section
     Chief, to move from assigned UH at the 20th week of pregnancy and receive BAH. An
     earlier move may be requested if determined necessary by medical authority. The
     commander may direct a pregnant member to terminate assigned UH from the 30 th week
     of pregnancy up to the date of birth. If a live birth does not occur, or the child does not
     reside with the member after BAH is authorized (i.e., adoption, resides with others
     relatives, etc.) paragraph 4.2 applies.
38                                                 AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012


        5.1.3.4.1. A single pregnant member may apply for FH (government controlled) 60
        days prior to the expected delivery date. However, the member may not be assigned
        quarters until entitled to BAH at the with-dependent rate.
        5.1.3.4.2. The installation may temporarily divert an excess FH unit to UH and allow
        the single pregnant member to occupy the unit 60 days prior to the anticipated
        delivery date (AFI 32-6001, paragraph 3.1.4). Before assignment in OCONUS areas,
        the member must provide evidence of application for command sponsorship and tour
        extension as an accompanied member.
     5.1.3.5. Personnel with extensive HHG. Members may submit a commander-endorsed
     request to the UH Management Section to reside in community housing and receive BAH
     when the annual cost of drayage and storage would exceed 50 percent of authorized BAH
     (drayage + 12 months storage)/by 12 months > (monthly BAH rate)/2).
     5.1.3.6. Personnel within 60 days of marriage, if setting up a household in the local area.
     Members may submit a commander-approved request to the UH Management Section to
     reside in community housing and receive BAH up to 60 days prior to pending marriage.
     Within 30 days after the date the marriage was scheduled to occur, member must submit
     proof of marriage to continue BAH. If the marriage does not occur, paragraph 4.2
     applies.
     5.1.3.7. Personnel who are military married to military (joint-spouse). Members with a
     military spouse who have an approved joint spouse assignment may submit a request to
     move from assigned UH to community housing and receive BAH 60 days prior to arrival
     of the spouse. If the joint assignment does not occur, paragraph 4.2 applies.
     5.1.3.8. Agents or agent-trainees with the Office of Special Investigation (OSI).
     Members who are OSI agents and agent-trainees may submit a request to the UH
     Management Section to reside in community housing and receive BAH. The request
     must include an Air Force OSI region commander or squadron commander certification
     that assignment to UH would impair agent or the agent trainee’s mission effectiveness.
     5.1.3.9. Personnel with approved terminal leave. Members who have approved terminal
     leave may request to move from assigned UH to community housing and receive BAH.
     The request must include documentation that the member is on terminal leave.
     5.1.3.10. ARC personnel on active duty for training. BAH entitlement for ARC
     members is determined by the availability of UH at each training location. Each training
     location is viewed as a different PDS.
        5.1.3.10.1. When UH is not available, the unit at the PDS prepares and sends to the
        UH Management Section Chief an AF IMT 594 and member’s orders on an AF Form
        1373, MPO Document Control Log-on Transmittal. Additionally, if a letter of
        determination from the unit commander is necessary it should be included. The UH
        Management Section Chief signs and forwards all documents to the member’s
        servicing pay FSO (provided by the ARC component) for processing.
     5.1.3.11. Members in an ARC component on active duty tours other than for training are
     entitled to BAH under the same conditions as members serving on full-time active duty.
     Use the same process specified in paragraph 5.1.3.10.1.
AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012                                                                39


  5.1.4. Members who are unaccompanied but have dependents residing elsewhere. Members
  with dependents residing elsewhere may occupy UH without affecting their right to receive
  BAH, at the with-dependent rate, under certain circumstances.
     5.1.4.1. A member may occupy UH or other government housing that does not exceed
     UH standards (Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3) for the member’s grade without dependents and
     still be eligible to receive BAH at the with-dependent rate if (a) the member is
     unaccompanied and (b) family members are not residing in adequate government quarters
     elsewhere (JFTR U10302).
     5.1.4.2. The following only applies to personnel designated K&E (all others are
     ineligible for this exception). If the member occupies UH or other government quarters
     which exceed the unaccompanied standard for the member’s grade, BAH will be
     terminated unless the quarters are the only quarters available and (a) quarters are not
     suitable for joint occupancy (Table 5.1) or (b) quarters are suitable for joint occupancy
     and are jointly occupied with another member of the appropriate grade permanently
     assigned to the duty station.
         5.1.4.2.1. Air Force policy is to discourage the use of government-owned or
         privatized FH units as temporary UH. FH units or other quarters temporarily
         designated as UH will be considered adequate for joint occupancy if they have at least
         two private bedrooms, two separate full bathrooms, with a total net living area at least
         equivalent to the total net living area the joint residents would each be entitled to if it
         were permanent UH. Members in grades 0-1 to 0-10, W-1 to W-5 and GS-10 and
         above must have access to a living room, kitchen and dining area (not necessarily
         private) as shown in Table 5.1.
         5.1.4.2.2. Regarding clause (b) in paragraph 5.1.4.2, the quarters must actually be
         jointly occupied, although such quarters may be singularly occupied for no longer
         than 30 days in order to accommodate a change in one of the joint residents who
         departs PCS. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Installations
         (SAF/IEI) may approve waivers to this policy to relieve hardship circumstances
         (other than financial).
     5.1.4.3. This policy does not apply to unaccompanied members residing in privatized
     housing since members must pay rental charges for PH.
     5.1.4.4. This policy applies to all locations and to FH units or other government quarters
     temporarily designated as UH.
     5.1.4.5. Unaccompanied members should be assigned quarters that meet adequacy
     standards for their grade, whenever possible.
  5.1.5. The UH Management Section is responsible for processing AF IMT 594, for
  unaccompanied personnel assigned UH.
     5.1.5.1. The UH Management Section prepares AF IMT 594 annotating the date and
     address of the UH being assigned or terminated and forwards the AF IMT 594 to the FSO
     for processing. The FSO determines dependency and BAH entitlements and records
     required changes on the AF IMT 594.

          5.1.5.1.1. For Army, Navy and Marine Corps members, the UH Management Section
          prepares the AF IMT 594 and forwards to the appropriate servicing FSO as identified
          by the squadron or member.
       5.1.5.2. Establish local procedures to ensure all AF IMT 594s are forwarded to the FSO
       within 1 workday after the member is assigned UH.

5.2. BAH Certification. Each quarter, IAW FSO guidance, the UH Management Section and
FSO reconcile their data to ensure members assigned to UH are receiving appropriate housing
allowances.
   5.2.1. The FSO provides the UH Management Section Chief a list of personnel residing in
   UH receiving more than partial rate BAH. Within 5 business days, the UH Management
   Section Chief validates the data and submits changes to the FSO using AF IMT 594. The
   action date on the AF IMT 594 will be retroactive to the date changes should be have
   effective.
   5.2.2. The FSO provides the UH Management Section Chief a list of personnel residing in
   UH not receiving partial BAH. Within 5 business days, the UH Management Section Chief

   IMT 594 will be retroactive to the date changes should have been effective.
   5.2.3. The UH Management Section, in partnership with the CPO, should reconcile their
   data to ensure APF civilians residing in UH, are forfeiting LQA and/or paying rent. The UH
   Management Section should work with tenant agencies to ensure civilians are forfeiting LQA
   and/or paying rent.
5.3. Drayage and Storage. If a move is directed by the government, local drayage and NTS of
personal property is authorized at government expense in connection with assignment or
termination of government quarters (JFTR, Volume 1, paragraphs U4770, U5355 and U5380).

   possible, but no later than 30 days after quarters are assigned.
       5.3.3.1. Member must submit an inventory of property to be stored. UH Manager only

       5.3.3.2. Members assigned UH as a Priority 3 or 4 are not entitled to government-funded
       moves, unless the member has been directed to move from one on-base facility to another

          their agency.
          5.5.1.2.2. For all other civilians not authorized LQA funded with APF, the UH
          Manager initiates actions to collect a monthly rental charge based on the established

Management Section Chief provides written notice to the servicing CPO and/or agency when
UH is assigned and terminated so that appropriate actions can be taken to start and stop LQA.
5.7. Dislocation Allowance (DLA). DLA may be authorized for members in PCS status to
partially reimburse relocation expenses not otherwise reimbursed. Conditions and requirements
for payment of DLA are identified in JFTR, Volume 1, Chapter 5, Part G. Members without
family members include personnel who have family members but do not relocate them in
conjunction with PCS. Personnel may be assigned to government quarters for a period NTE 60
days without impacting their entitlement to DLA. When calculating the 60 days, exclude days

authorized by the member’s commanding officer for a maximum of 120 days.
   5.7.1. DLA entitlement does not exist for members in grades E-4 with 3 or less YOS and
   below who have been offered permanent quarters, but elect to live off base at their own
   expense.
   5.7.2. Members in grade E-4 with 3 YOS and above who elect to reside off base are eligible
   to receive DLA, regardless of the availability of quarters and may self-certify their non-

requirements for payment of TLA are identified in the JFTR, Volume 1, Chapter 9.
5.10. Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE). TLE is authorized for members to partially offset
the added living expenses incurred within CONUS when it is necessary for the member and/or
dependents to occupy TLF due to PCS. TLE is payable for TLF occupied in the old and new

5.13. Housekeeping and Custodial Services. All members assigned quarters are responsible
for ensuring individual rooms and common areas meet local cleaning standards. Lodging offices
may elect to provide this service to members assigned UOQs or UNCOQs for a fee. The UH
Management Section should work with lodging to establish a written agreement to meet
AFI32-6005_AFSPCSUP_I 6 JUNE 2012                                                               45


minimum cleanliness standards and a service charge that is set at the lowest possible rate to
cover direct costs and a fair share of the lodging administrative and other indirect costs.
Members should work directly with the lodging office to establish the service. Commanders
may make housekeeping service or custodial service a mandatory condition for personnel
voluntarily occupying UNCOQs or UOQs.
5.14. Daily Operations. An UH Operations PE is established to identify funding requirements
for UH management (xx679). This PE covers requirements associated with the UH assignments,
terminations, surveys, utilization and inspections. It excludes any administrative costs associated
with the management of furnishings operation and all requirements funded under Facility
Operations (FO), Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization of facilities [e.g., facility project

       and replacement linens. Government-owned supply items such as toilet paper, light
       bulbs, toilet/shower cleaner, window cleaner, paper towels and other miscellaneous

use gritty or harsh detergents when cleaning. Also, do not pour grease down the drain as it can
solidify in the pipes and cause stoppages. Be careful to keep hot pots, pans and utensils off
countertops to avoid permanent damage. We recommend nonadhesive shelf paper for inside
drawers and cupboards to avoid damaging surfaces upon removal. Clean walls periodically to
prevent grease buildup.
Bathroom. Because of the potential for bacteria growth, bathroom areas require special care and
attention. Clean the toilet inside and out with a disinfectant type cleaner at least weekly. Do not
leave soap scum or other residue on walls. Since shower curtains tend to mold quickly if
allowed to remain damp for extended periods of time, clean mold and mildew stains frequently.
If the stains will not come off, request a new one from the UH Manager. Clean tub and shower
walls periodically with a product made to clean mildew.
Floors. Excessive water can damage any floor. Use a quality wax remover to prevent wax
build-up, paying special attention to corners and baseboards.
Carpets. Vacuum and shampoo carpets, as needed.
Walls. Use mild soap and warm water for cleaning walls. Do not apply adhesive-backed
materials, wallpaper, or decals to the walls, since removal can cause damage. Use nails or
picture hangers to hang pictures and objects and fill holes when you remove the nails. Please
make sure doorstops are in place to prevent damage to walls. (Indicate items the self-help store
maintains.)
Painting. Request prior approval from the UH Manager to paint your room.
