1. Objectives. The primary goal of the Vandenberg Air Force Base Cross Connection Control and Back-
flow Prevention Program is to protect public health and to ensure the potablity and safety of the base
drinking water supply and system. This program is also intended to identify local requirements as estab-
lished by the 30th Civil Engineer Squadron, and to clarify and simplify existing requirements as estab-
lished by AFI 32-1066, Plumbing Systems, Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations, the Uniform
Plumbing Code (UPC), the Launch Operations & Support Contract, and any Memorandums of Under-
standing or Agreement. Furthermore, interpretations of existing California law as determined by the
Department of Health Services of Santa Barbara County are included in this instruction.

2. Scope. A vigilant and proactive cross connection control and backflow prevention program will help
to significantly minimize backflow occurrences in the base potable water supply and system. Serious ill-
nesses and deaths have resulted in this country due to backflow incidents that were directly attributable to
the ineffective management of a backflow prevention program. It is critically important, therefore, that a
program be aggressively and alertly managed and maintained to ensure public safety and to protect the
potable water supply and system. This instruction focuses on the following elements of the base program:
   2.1. Base Cross Connection Control (CCC) and Backflow Prevention Program Management Respon-
   sibilities.
   2.2. Contractor And Independent Agency (IA) Responsibilities.
   2.3. Cross Connection Control, Identification, and Mitigation.
   2.4. CCC and Backflow Prevention Assembly (BPA) Documentation And Inventory Control.
   2.5. BPA Test Scheduling, Procedures, Documentation, and Reporting Requirements.
   2.6. BPA Repair and Correction Requirements.
   2.7. BPA Tester Certification Requirements.
   2.8. BPA Tester Training Courses.

4. Cross Connection Control.
   4.1. Procedures:
      4.1.1. Identification.
         4.1.1.1. A cross-connection is any actual or potential physical connection between the potable
         water supply and a non-potable water supply. Non-potable sources include industrial fluids,
         gases, or any substance other than that intended for a potable water system.
8                                                                      30SWI32-1066 1 APRIL 2004


       4.1.1.2. Personnel performing Cross Connection surveys should be trained in a Backflow Pre-
       vention Assemblies or Cross-Connection Survey course. Certification by the United States Air
       Force, California-Nevada American Water Works Association (AWWA), American Backflow
       Prevention Association (ABPA), or the University of Southern California is highly recom-
       mended.
       4.1.1.3. When surveying or identifying cross-connections, the craftsman should start tracing
       the water system from the facility’s isolation valve to the mechanical or boiler room. From that
       point the rest of the potable water system should be traced downstream towards any other
       rooms that have a water supply terminating in it, such as laboratories, bathrooms, and kitch-
       ens. The facility’s fire suppression system should also be inspected for BPAs or cross connec-
       tions from the main valve connection [usually the Position Indicator Valve (PIV)] to the
       system’s termination point(s).
       4.1.1.4. An exterior inspection of the facility is also required, including the tracing and inspec-
       tion of all hose bibbs, lawn sprinkler or irrigation systems, air conditioning or chiller units,
       cooling towers, and any other type of treatment equipment requiring water.
       4.1.1.5. Once a cross connection has been identified, it must be classified according to the risk
       it poses to the potable water system or supply. Vandenberg Air Force Base will classify cross
       connections based on the potential pollutant or contamination threat it poses to the water sys-
       tem. All cross connections will be classified as either High or Low Hazards (see Attachment
       1).
    4.1.2. Isolation / Mitigation.
       4.1.2.1. Backflow Incidents. If a backflow incident occurs, the backflow hazard will be imme-
       diately corrected, a cause determined for the incident, and a plan of action implemented to pre-
       vent further backflow incidents of a similar nature from occurring.
       4.1.2.2. High Hazards. If a cross connection is identified between the potable water system
       and a source of pollution or contamination, it will require urgent attention for remediation. If
       the source of cross connection poses a contamination risk to the potable water system (i.e.,
       poison, sewage, or health risk), then it must be immediately corrected or the source of contam-
       ination disconnected from the potable water system until a correction can be made.
       4.1.2.3. Low Hazards. If the source of cross connection poses a pollution (low) hazard to the
       potable water system, then it must be corrected within thirty days of its discovery. Immediate
       correction or isolation or the cross connection will only be required if a backflow condition is
       perceived or is occurring. If a correction cannot be made within thirty days, then the cross con-
       nection must be isolated or disconnected from the potable system until it is corrected.
       4.1.2.4. Before, during, and/or after isolating and disconnecting a piece of equipment, area, or
       facility, you must immediately notify the Facility Manager and the Utility Systems Work
       Scheduler of your actions. When discussing your actions with the Facility Manager, it is
       important that you inform him or her that your primary duty is the protection of the potable
       water supply.
    4.1.3. Correcting Cross Connections.
       4.1.3.1. Install only approved backflow prevention assemblies. Primacy over assembly
       approval rests with the California Department of Health Services in accordance with the Cali-
30SWI32-1066 1 APRIL 2004                                                                                  9


          fornia Code Of Regulations, Title 17. Local jurisdiction over enforcement and punitive action
          over these assemblies rests with the Department of Health Services of the County of Santa
          Barbara. A complete listing of approved assemblies is in Appendix G. Since this list is updated
          on an annual basis, the most current list can be obtained by accessing the California DHS web-
          site at: http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ps/ddwem/publications/Backflow_2000.PDF
          4.1.3.2. All assemblies must be installed in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code, Air
          Force, federal, state, or local regulation. Follow the regulation that requires the most stringent
          installation method.
          4.1.3.3. Once a new assembly is installed, it is important to add the assembly to the Backflow
          Prevention Assembly Inventory and placed on the schedule for regular inspection and mainte-
          nance. An initial test and inspection must be performed immediately after installation, and a
          follow-up inspection must be performed 90 days after installation. Any additional or further
          inspections and testing will be conducted in accordance with 30SWI32-1066.
      4.1.4. For further information regarding cross-connections and backflow assemblies, please refer
      to the Uniform Plumbing Code, Air Force Instructions, Manual For Cross Connection Control
      (USC), the California DHS Guidance Manual For Cross Connection Control Programs, and
      applicable manuals and training texts.

5. VCCCBP Program And BPA Documentation And Inventory Control.
   5.1. Regulations Management. The VCCCBP Program Manager will maintain all applicable Air
   Force, federal, state, county, and local operating instructions or regulations in a hard-copy and (if pos-
   sible) electronic format concerning the VCCCBP Program.
   5.2. Field Test Forms Management. The VCCCBP Program Manager will maintain hard-copy
   records all BPA Field Test Forms for a minimum of the prior three years’ worth of test information for
   each BPA. The Field Test Forms will be organized and filed to allow quick and easy access to verify
   historical test data for each individual BPA. The VCCCBP Program Manager will be responsible for
   updating or modifying the Field Test Form if any changes are required.

     5.3. Database Inventory Management. The VCCCBP Program Manager will be responsible for
     maintaining the database inventory record for all BPAs located on Vandenberg Air Force Base and any
     other remote sites assigned to its responsibility. The primary method of database management will be
     performed through the Cross Connection Management System, which is a Microsoft Access elec-
     tronic database program. Hard-copy records of the database inventory and other relevant information
     will be maintained by the Program Manager as a standby for the electronic database record and to
     allow for faster access to certain elements of the program. Additional inventory control and testing
     schedules will be maintained and kept current in the Recurring Work Program (RWP) of the Interim
     Work Information Management System (IWIMS) or the Automated Civil Engineer System (ACES).
     The RWP is principally used to track work progress and accountability, and to monitor labor and
     material expenditures.
     5.4. Database Records Management. All Vandenberg BPAs will be inventoried and the relevant
     information for each assembly will be maintained in the following formats:
        5.4.1. AF IMT 843, Backflow Prevention Inspection Form, and AF IMT 844, Backflow Pre-
        vention Inspection Form, will be an optional method to track test information because Vanden-
        berg uses a local Field Test Form as a suitable substitute.
        5.4.2. AF IMT 845, Cross Connection Information record will be kept current with the follow-
        ing data:
            5.4.2.1. Date.

6. BPA Test Scheduling, Procedures, Documentation, And Reporting Requirements.
   6.1. Test Scheduling.
      6.1.1. It is imperative that a consistent and recurring BPA test schedule be developed, imple-
      mented, tracked, and followed with minimal deviation. When developing a test schedule, one of
16                                                                        30SWI32-1066 1 APRIL 2004


        the most important variables to consider is the anticipated BPA failure rate, which can be as high
        as twenty-five percent. Part of the BPA testing schedule should therefore take into account ade-
        quate assembly repair and replacement time while still maintaining a viable testing schedule.
        6.1.2. Following are the minimum testing requirements for Vandenberg BPAs:

Table 1. BP Assembly Minimum Testing Requirements.
Assembly Type / Degree Of Hazard                     Minimum Testing Requirements

Air Gap                                              Annual
Low (Pollution) Hazard                               Annual
High (Contamination) Hazard                          Semi-Annual
Repaired BPA                                         Immediately After Repair
New BPA                                              Immediately After Installation
                                                     90 Days After Installation

     6.2. Test Procedures And Repair Requirements.
        6.2.1. Test procedures for all Vandenberg BPAs will be in accordance with industry-accepted
        standards as outlined in Manual Of Cross Connection Control, Ninth Edition (or later), Univer-
        sity of Southern California. Applicable manufacturer’s instruction manuals will also be used if
        they comply with the minimum testing standards as outlined in the Manual Of Cross Connection
        Control.
        6.2.2. If a BPA should fail testing, then it will be immediately retested. If the assembly fails the
        retest, the BPA will be repaired as soon as possible to correct the malfunction. Time constraints on
        BPA repairs will be:

Table 2. Assembly Repair Timetable.
Degree Of Hazard                              BPA Will Be Repaired In

High                                          30 Calendar Days
Low                                           30 Calendar Days

           6.2.2.1. High Hazards. For high hazard applications, if a backflow condition is anticipated,
           perceived, or is occurring, then the assembly will be immediately isolated until it is repaired
           and passes the appropriate BPA test.
           6.2.2.2. Low Hazards. For low hazard applications, malfunctioning assemblies can be left in
           service until repaired as provided by Table 2., but only if a backflow condition is not per-
           ceived or is not occurring. If a backflow condition is perceived or is occurring, then the assem-
           bly will be immediately isolated until the assembly is repaired and passes the appropriate BPA
           test.
           6.2.2.3. Bypass Arrangements. A bypass system can be used while the BPA is isolated if the
           bypass arrangement has the same or higher backflow protection as provided by the isolated
30SWI32-1066 1 APRIL 2004                                                                                 17


           BPA. To ensure the requirements in Table 2. are met, it is highly recommended that a suffi-
           cient amount of spare parts or repair kits be kept on inventory to avoid delays in the repair pro-
           cess.
   6.3. Test And Repair Documentation.
        6.3.1. Proper documentation for BPA testing is critical in maintaining an accurate database inven-
        tory system. Failure to properly document test results can result in program confusion, unneces-
        sary retesting, and present a false impression of the program’s status.
