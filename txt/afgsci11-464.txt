                                        Chapter 1
                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. References, Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms. See Attachment 1.

1.2. General. The objective of formal flying training is to ensure student aircrews attain the
skill level established by syllabus course training standards. AFGSC formal flying training will
offer aircrews the opportunity to develop their maximum individual capabilities within the
constraints of available sorties, facilities, or other resources. This instruction describes the forms
and procedures used to document the student's progress toward and attainment of course
training standards.
1.3. AFGSC Weapon System Training Program Managers. AFGSC/A3TO is the training
program manager and coordinates AFGSC actions associated with programming, scheduling,
and conducting formal training for the B-2 and B-52 weapon systems. AFGSC/A3TW
represents the USAF Weapons School and their Weapons Instructor Courses.
1.4. Screening of Student Data. Units will screen incoming student records to ensure that
they are complete and that course entry prerequisites are met. Units will immediately notify the
AFGSC training program manager if records are missing or if the student does not meet course
entry prerequisites and there is no evidence of a waiver. The AFGSC training program
manager will notify the appropriate training unit when course entry prerequisites are waived for
any student.
1.5. Class Quotas. The AFGSC Programmed Flying Training (PFT) document establishes
quotas for each class. The AFGSC training program manager will notify affected units of
changes of quotas. If the number of available students fails to equal the latest established class
quota, the training unit will immediately notify the AFGSC training program manager.
1.6. Student Training Records:
1.6.1. Formal Training Units (FTU) will prepare Student Training Record Folders for each
student entering training.
1.6.2. Lists of records that will be filed/maintained in the Student Training Record Folder
are in Chapter 2 of this instruction. Individual FTUs may develop local training forms with
the approval of the OG/CC (or equivalent). These forms will include but are not limited to the
student's name and rank, instructor's name and rank, date of mission, sortie number, module or
phase completed (if applicable).
1.6.3. Student Training Record Folders will be available for review by instructors, supervisors,
and student aircrew members.
1.6.4. Instructors will review Student Training Record Folders prior to each flight or simulator
mission. Supervisors will make weekly reviews of the progress of student aircrews.
1.7. Distinguished Graduates (DGs). The goal in designating DGs is to give formal
recognition to aircrew members who demonstrate superior performance. DG status does not
automatically apply to the best student in a given class; the highest standards apply, and it is
possible that a given class may have no DGs. The FTU is responsible for determining DG
eligibility criteria. The OG/CC or equivalent will approve the criteria and include it in this
AFGSCI 11-464 1 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 5

instruction's wing supplement. Annotate Training Record, or equivalent, to reflect DG status for
those selected.
1.8. Withdrawal from Training. When a student withdraws from training for medical or other
reasons (e.g., extended Duties Not Involving Flying [DNIF], Flying Evaluation Board [FEB],
waiver to FEB, death, etc.), the training unit will immediately notify the AFGSC weapon system
training program manager (AFGSC/A3TO) by message or e-mail with an information copy to
Numbered Air Force (NAF) CV (For ANG students, unit's request from ANG/DPDF to have the
student recalled). Recalling a student from training is initiated by the gaining unit, students
cannot withdraw themselves. In accordance with (IAW) AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, page
5, paragraph 1.5.2.2, Recall Procedures; MAJCOMs will notify training command headquarters
and training units prior to recalling a student from a formal school course. Recalling a student
will be done for reasons other than performance. i.e., emergencies, unforeseen delays in
training, etc.) If the student is a recent Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training/ Specialized
Undergraduate Navigator/Combat Systems Officer Training or IFF graduate, send an
information copy of the message to AFPC/DPAOC. The message will include the student's
name, rank, Social Security Account Number, and assignment action number; the course title
and class number from which the student was withdrawn; the reason for withdrawal; and any
effect on follow-on courses/assignments. See AFI 36-2110, Assignments, for additional
guidance.
1.9. Disposition of Student Training Records:
1.9.1. Student Training Records will be either hand-carried by the graduate or mailed/e-mailed
directly to the gaining unit within 10 working days after the graduation date. Only complete
records may be hand-carried. If any portion of the records is incomplete when the graduate
departs, the FTU must complete and mail the records within the time limit.
1.9.2. Student Training Records of aircrew members who are withdrawn from a course
due to requests for suspension, fear of flying, FEB action for failure to meet course training
standards, or by reason of death, will be filed and then destroyed.
1.9.3. The unit will retain Student Training Records of aircrew members who complete formal
training and remain in the same unit.
1.9.4. USAF Weapons School student grade books will remain at the weapons school. The
USAF Weapons School will complete a Training Record and Training Summary; and then
forward them to the student's gaining unit.
1.9.5. "Academic only" courses do not require student grade books. However flying courses
that consist of academics at the FTU and in-unit flying still require grade books.
1.10. Course Critiques. Units conducting formal flying training courses will solicit student
comments on the effectiveness of instruction using locally developed end-of-course critiques. In
addition to review by FTU agencies, the FTU's operations training development team will
review the critiques.
1.11. Classification of Training Systems. AFGSC uses two generalized training systems in
flying training programs. The OG/CC (or equivalent) will determine the system the unit uses,
and will notify the AFGSC training program manager. Once designated, the chosen system
applies to all flying courses in a given FTU.
6                                                       AFGSCI 11-464 1 FEBRUARY 2010

1.11.1. Sortie-Driven System. The basic building block for student progression is
completion of specific sorties, modules ("blocks"), or phases.
1.11.2. Event-Driven System. The basic building block for student progression is the
individual event or training task. The unit may combine events or tasks in appropriate sequences
on a given mission.
1.12. Grading Criteria. FTUs may use the criteria in Table 1.2. to grade both specific mission
elementsand overall performance on each flight and simulator mission. Units may also use
criteria developed by the unit and approved by AFGSC/A3T. Reference to additional criteria,
such as written behavioral objectives, is permissible.
1.12.1. Determine individual mission element grades and the overall mission grade by
comparing the student's performance with the grading criteria. The overall grade is an
assessment of the student's achievement of the primary mission objectives for that sortie.
1.12.2. As a minimum, record grades for each mission on the Individual Mission Grade sheet.


Table 1.2. Grading Criteria.

         Grade             Explanation of Grade
         Unknown           Performance was not observed or the element was not performed.
         Dangerous         Performance was unsafe (one element marked "Dangerous" will
                           require an overall grade of "zero").
         0                 Performance indicates a lack of ability or knowledge.
         1                 Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of
                           omission or commission.
         2                 Performance is essentially correct. Recognizes and corrects errors.
         3                 Performance is correct, efficient, skillful, and without hesitation.
         4                 Performance reflects an unusually high degree of ability.

1.13. Course Training Standards. Use course training standards in course design to describe
the minimum overall performance levels required to progress through and/or graduate from a
course. Standards will reflect average performance as described in the units grading standards;
an example would be a "1", "2", or "3", as defined above in paragraph 1.2. It is inappropriate to
design courses to train to the upper or lower end of the grading scale.
1.14. Documentation of Achievement of Course Training Standards:
1.14.1. Sortie-driven Systems. The student's immediate supervisor will determine
achievement of course training standards in each phase, module, or course for sortie-driven
system. The supervisor will enter the following statement in the remark's section of the final
individual grade sheet at each stage: "Course training standards achieved for (enter appropriate
phase, module, or course)." Enter the standards achieved in each phase/module/course on the
training record.
1.14.2. Event-driven Systems. The student's immediate supervisor will determine that
AFGSCI 11-464 1 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   7

achievement of proficiency in all required events is complete before the AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew
Standardization/ Evaluation Program, flight. The instructor will enter the following statement
on the master training record: "Proficiency achieved in all required events."
1.15. Responsibilities of Syllabus Offices of Primary Development Responsibility (OPDRs):
1.15.1. Determine the level of proficiency required of each task in the task list and publish
course training standards in each syllabus as required by AFGSCI 36-2252, Air Force Global
Strike Command (AFGSC) Formal Operations Training Publications.
1.15.2. Use the course task list to develop master overprints of mission elements for Individual
Mission Grade Sheets for flying and simulator missions.
1.16. Non-effective Missions:
1.16.1. Sortie-driven Programs:
1.16.1.1. Mark a mission Non-effective/Student Non-progression (NE/SNP) on the Individual
Mission Grade Sheet if student performance is not sufficient to allow progression to the next
syllabus mission or if the student receives a "Dangerous" performance grade. Make an entry
citing specific student performance deficiencies. For missions marked NE/SNP, the student will
fly an additional instruction sortie ("X" sortie), for example, if TR-6 is NE/SNP, annotate the
additional sortie as TR-6X.
1.16.1.2. Mark a mission Non-effective/Other (NE/OTH) on the Individual Mission Grade
Sheet when the student cannot complete specific elements called for in the mission and the unit
cannot incorporate them into a subsequent mission. This is not an "X" sortie. The instructor will
make an entry citing the specific reason the mission was non-effective (for example, weather,
weapon system malfunction, air abort, etc.). For missions marked NE/OTH, the mission will be
reflown (for example, if TR-6 is NE/OTH, fly another mission with the TR-6 annotation).
1.16.2. Event-driven Systems:
1.16.2.1. Mark an event NE/SNP on the Individual Mission Grade sheet if the student has not
met proficiency requirements and is unable to complete an AFI 11-202V2 mission. Entries by
the instructor will cite specific student performance deficiencies. For events marked NE/SNP,
the student will fly an additional instruction sortie ("X" sortie) concentrating on event(s)
requiring proficiency. The sortie will be reflown as the last sortie the student completed (for
example, if S-14 is the last sortie prior to the AFI 11-202V2 mission, annotate the X sortie as S-
14X).
1.16.2.2. Mark an event or sortie NE/OTH on the Individual Mission Grade Sheet when the
student cannot complete specific events called for in the mission and the unit cannot incorporate
them into a subsequent mission. Events marked NE/OTH will require a waiver prior to
the AFI 11-202V2 mission or graduation.
1.17. Procedures for Handling Substandard Performance (Flying and Simulator Missions).
Remedial action for failure to meet performance standards may include training/practice using
academic programs, part-task trainers, simulators, or additional sorties.
1.17.1. Additional Sorties:
1.17.1.1. Sortie-driven Systems. The unit will call additional instructional sorties "X" sorties
and identify them by adding the suffix "X" to the normal syllabus sortie number. The student
8                                                       AFGSCI 11-464 1 FEBRUARY 2010

will fly an "X" sortie when the instructor marks a mission Non-effective/Student Non-
progression (NE/SNP) or when a student fails to meet course training standards at the end of a
phase, module, or course. If an "X" sortie is not successful and requires additional "X" sorties
for the same syllabus sortie annotate those additional sorties with suffixes "XX," "XXX," etc., to
the normal syllabus sortie number. The squadron commander may authorize additional
instructional sorties only to the extent that such flights would result in the student meeting
course requirements.
1.17.1.2. Event-driven Systems. Additional instructional sorties are "X" sorties and identified
by adding the suffix "X" to the last normal training sorties prior to checkride. A student will fly
an "X" sortie upon the failure to meet end of course training standards and completion of the
total number of syllabus sorties. If an "X" sortie is not successful and requires additional "X"
sorties for the same events. The instructor will annotate the additional sorties by adding suffixes
"XX," "XXX" etc., to the number of the last training sortie. The squadron commander may
authorize additional instructional sorties only to the extent that such flights would result in the
student meeting end of course requirements.
1.17.1.3. Maximum Additional Sorties. Each AFGSC formal course syllabus determines the
maximum number of "X" sorties per course. "X" sorties beyond the course limit require the
approval of the training program manager. Corrective action (adding the suffix "C" to the
normal syllabus sortie number) and recheck sorties (the suffix "R") generated because of
standardization/evaluation flight check deficiencies are not "X" sorties.
1.17.2. Progress Check Flight. A progress check flight is a non-instructional sortie flown at the
discretion of the squadron commander to document a student's proficiency level and to
recommend follow-on action. There is no requirement to provide a progress check flight.
1.17.2.1. Identify a progress check flight by adding the suffix "Prog" to the normal syllabus
sortie number. It is not countable as an "X" sortie.
1.17.2.2. The squadron commander may direct a progress check at any time. The progress
check will include an assessment of the student's basic flying skills. Recommendations of
personnel conducting progress checks may be, but are not limited to: continuation in the
normal course of training, additional training followed by another progress check, or
elimination from the course.
1.17.2.3. The FTU will conduct, if required, an FEB IAW AFI 11-402, Aviation and
Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings, and Badges.
1.17.3. The training unit will notify the ANG/DPDF if an ANG student is placed into remedial
training for failure to meet performance standards.
1.18. Class Training Summary. Training units will send a summary for each graduating class to
the AFGSC/A3TO weapon system training program manager. Units may send this report by
FAX or electronically. The report will contain the following:
1.18.1. A list of graduates by name, rank, and end assignment.
1.18.2. Comments and recommendations concerning problem areas.
1.18.3. Number entering training (including washbacks from earlier classes).
1.18.4. Number graduating.
AFGSCI 11-464 1 FEBRUARY 2010                                                       9

1.18.5. Number of individuals washed back to later classes.
1.18.6. Names of individuals withdrawn from training for any cause. Indicate new class
designation for washbacks and specify reasons for withdrawals.
1.18.7. Number of additional missions flown (flight and simulator) due to student non-
progression. Report type of event or mission.

                             STUDENT TRAINING RECORDS

2.1. Student Training Records. The following documentation will be filed/maintained in the
Student Training Record Folder. The documentation will be applicable to both sortie and event
driven systems. Each wing will develop a standard format for training records. Upon approval
of the OG/CC or equivalent, the FTU may include local forms that meet school needs. FTUs
will include locally developed forms in the local supplement to this regulation.
2.2. Completion of Records. Complete all records by computer or in ink. The records for each
student should include:
2.2.1. Flying/Simulator Training. For each phase, enter the actual number of sorties flown.
Enter the overall course-training standard achieved for each phase of training.
2.2.2. Tactical/Weapons Delivery Accomplishment. Enter proficiency achieved in each event
without regard to proficiency required. This will recognize above-or below-average performance
(for example: required FAM but achieved QUAL or required QUAL, but achieved NONE).
2.2.3. Training Deficiencies. List all training deficiencies. Identify the office or agency that
granted the waiver to graduate the student with a training deficiency.
2.2.4. Academic Training. For courses with exams, enter the percentage grade achieved. Enter
the failed exam grade and followed by the make-up exam grade (for example, 72/89).
2.2.5. End-of-phase summary. Should contain a brief description of the student's characteristic
flying performance in each phase and should cite specific strengths, weaknesses, areas of
improvement, and general attitudes. When a student flies at least one sortie, an entry is
mandatory for that phase of training. When two or fewer sorties constitute a phase, the
instructor may combine entries with another phase (for example: Transition/Formation). To
ensure accurate recall of desired details, instructors will write phase summaries as soon as
possible after the completion of each phase. The end-of-course summary will contain a brief
description of the student's overall flying performance during the course and should include an
overall evaluation of the student's judgment, situation awareness, flight discipline, and general
airmanship. It will include an assessment of performance trends throughout the course and a
subjective evaluation of the degree of supervision the student will require at the gaining unit.
2.2.6. Maintain a chronological record of all flying and simulator missions accomplished.
2.2.7. The Individual Mission Grade Sheet. A student will receive a grade for each flying
and simulator mission where performance is under the supervision of an instructor. The
instructor will complete the grade sheet prior to the next mission (unless flown with the same
instructor on the same day) but in no case later than 48 hours following the mission. Until some
information is available, the instructor may withhold an assessment of performance in events
requiring weapons scores, film/video tape recorder assessment, or any other data. The following
should be documented on the individual mission grade sheet:
2.2.7.1. Details of student performance graded below phase/block standard, as needed to
properly advise subsequent instructors of the student's training progress.
2.2.7.2 Specific student performance deficiencies for missions marked NE/SNP.
