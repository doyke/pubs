Supersedes QTP 4Y0X2-4, 01 Sep. 2001
Introduction ___________________________________________________ i


        Volume 4, Dental Laboratory Administration, contains modules on managing
inventories of artificial teeth and precious metals, conducting self-assessments, preparing and
reviewing operating policies and instructions, preparing and reviewing reports and
correspondence, reporting defective equipment, and reporting treatment data. This QTP is
designed to enhance 5- and 7-skill level OJT of dental laboratory personnel. The 4Y0X2
Career Development Courses may be used to compliment the training references listed in a
module. All QTPs are intended to be used by trainees, trainers, supervisors, and task
certifiers. Before initiating any training you should review your responsibilities—as a
supervisor/trainer—for conducting on-the-job training (OJT) per AFI 36-2201, Volume 3,
Air Force Training Program On The Job Training Administration.

        QTPs are designed to help you conduct and evaluate your field training. Once you
begin upgrade training you are required to use the QTPs. QTPs provide continuity to the
trainee’s upgrade training and are divided into the following volumes: 1) General Dental
Laboratory Experience; 2) Fixed Prosthodontics 3) Treatment and Orthodontic Appliances,
Complete and Removable Partial Dentures; 4) Dental Laboratory Administration; 5)
Medical Material; and 6) Supervision and Training. The QTP modules were written to assist
you in preparing for and conducting training. You must use the QTP modules for training
when the STS task is a core task (minimum qualification for the specialty). Each module
segments the major tasks into teachable elements. Your goal is to provide enough training
and guidance so trainees can do all task related steps, without assistance, and produce an
appliance that meets local requirements for speed and accuracy. QTPs also aid OJT task
certifiers in evaluating the trainee’s demonstrated performance. If you have local training
requirements not covered by a QTP module you should develop “steps in performance” and
“performance checklists” that support and standardize those tasks.

       Accompanying each volume of QTPs is a qualification training progress record.
This QTP record serves as a document to record the date the trainee completes each module.
Every person in qualification/upgrade training must have this QTP progress record filed in
their OJT folder. Use and annotation of this progress record is similar to current OJT
documentation. When you are satisfied the trainee meets standards, as prescribed in the QTP
performance checklist, you must document each task completion date in the “date
completed” column in the QTP progress record. If a person is being recertified on a task that
is supported by a QTP you must use that module to complete the recertification process.

       Typically, you will manage each module by first, training the tasks and then,
evaluating performance. Your local steps in performance may vary from the method listed in
the QTP module. If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to the first half of
each module, (i.e. steps in task performance); however, the “performance checklist” is
considered a standard and cannot be altered. You may train each QTP volume/module in
any sequence; however, when conducting training use an organized and methodical
approach. This will reduce your training time and enhance your efforts.

      For effective use of this QTP, conduct training in the following manner:
          1. Review the procedures in each module with the trainee.
Introduction ___________________________________________________ ii

          2. Direct the trainee to review the training references listed to prepare for task
             performance.
          3. Review the steps in task performance with the trainee, allowing enough time to
             adequately train each step (some modules may take longer to teach).
          4. Evaluate the trainee’s work at each critical step—using the performance
             checklist at this point will be helpful.
          5. Fifth, evaluate the trainee’s performance and provide feedback on any areas for
             improvement.
          6. Finally, when the trainee has successfully completed the task you must
             document and initial both the STS and the QTP progress record. If the trainee
             does not accomplish the module, conduct follow-up instruction until the trainee
             successfully completes the task.

      The QTP project goal of the 381st Training Squadron, Sheppard AFB TX, is to publish
a useable document for trainers and trainees. You are encouraged to write-in changes or
revisions to the QTPs. A corrections/improvements letter is located on the last page of each
QTP volume. You may choose to call in your recommendations to DSN 736-6906 or FAX
DSN/Commercial 736-2781 or (940) 676-2781 or you can email the author at
andrea.bates@sheppard.af.mil.

STEPS IN TASK PERFORMANCE:
     1. Local fabrication standards will be determined by the laboratory officer and
        the laboratory NCOIC
     2. Standards will be based off of what the laboratory officer deems clinically acceptable.
     3. Fabrication standards are developed locally as part of an established quality control plan that
        includes:
        a. A review by the laboratory officer or laboratory NCOIC of all incoming,
           working, and completed cases.
        b. The review for incoming cases should ensure: acceptable casts, adequate
           occlusal records, a properly completed and signed DD Form 2322, and any
           additional items e.g. shade tabs, matrices, and drawings.
        c. The fabrication standards should require a review of the
           prostheses/appliance by a trainer or NCOIC at the completion of logical
           steps in the fabrication process.
        d. A review of completed casework should include general requirements such
           as; sanitation, form, function, and esthetics.
     4. Review feedback from the prescribing dentists and have a method in place for
        tracking data to evaluate trends and identify areas for improvement.
