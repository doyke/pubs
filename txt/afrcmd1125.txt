1. Mission: RED HORSE is a self-sufficient, mobile, heavy construction squadron capable of
rapid response and independent operations in remote, high-threat environments worldwide. They
provide heavy repair and construction capabilities when requirements exceed that of Prime
BEEF civil engineer unit capabilities. The primary mission of RED HORSE Squadrons is to
assess,     plan    and     establish    contingency      facilities/infrastructure  to     support
humanitarian/contingency operations and combat missions. Activities include rapid
assessment/repair, bare-base development, and heavy construction operations such as runways,
aircraft parking ramps, and large facilities. RED HORSE Squadrons possesses special
capabilities such as remote beddown planning, water-well drilling, explosive demolition, quarry
operations, material testing, concrete and asphalt paving, and expedient facility construction.
2. Command. The RHS Commander:
     2.1. Reports to the Commander, 622d Civil Engineer Group.
     2.2. Exercises administrative control over assigned personnel and assigned units.

12304b), combatant command authority (COCOM) transfers to the combatant commander to
which the forces are assigned/attached and operational control (OPCON) transfers to the
operational chain of command established by that commander.
