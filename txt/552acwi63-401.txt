This instruction implements responsibilities and procedures for reporting suspected errors in
software and for requesting changes to software programs and documentation through the use of
Computer Software Change Requests (CSCRs). Operating instructions or processes may be
developed to provide detailed procedures for processing CSCRs within wing agencies. This
instruction is the prescribing directive for the 552d Air Control Wing (552 ACW) 2, 5 Oct 11;
552 ACW 6, 1 Apr 10; 552 ACW 7, 5 Oct 11; 552 ACW 8, 5 Oct 11; and 552 ACW 9, 5 Oct 11.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Information Management Tool (IMT) 847, Recommendation
for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through Major Command
(MAJCOM) publications/forms managers. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFPD 33-3, Information
Management, and AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the      Air      Force      Records       Disposition      Schedule     (RDS)       located     at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Contact supporting records manager as
required. This instruction is directive and applies to all units and personnel assigned to the 552
ACW. It does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard
(ANG) units, except where noted otherwise. This Instruction may not be supplemented.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Added instructions for submitting AOCP CSCRs,DBCRs, C2MS PERs and SDRs, revisions to
update office symbols and changed formatting where applicable.
 2                                                              552ACWI63-401 17 May 2012


1. Policy. The timely identification, expeditious processing and appropriate feedback of
software incidents/errors and software changes are essential for accomplishment of the 552d Air
Control Wing’s mission. CSCRs must be submitted in order for customer requirements to be met
and software/documentation errors to be corrected in a timely manner.
2. Responsibilities. All 552 ACW personnel using or maintaining software are responsible for
identifying program and documentation incidents/errors and suggested changes by submitting
appropriate CSCRs as specified. It is the responsibility of all CSCR originators and analysts to
ensure their respective portions of the CSCR are accurate and complete, and to comply with the
instructions contained in the attachments.
     2.1. Focal Points. Effective and efficient software development requires an integrated but
     focused review of CSCRs.
        2.1.1. The single point of contact for all CSCRs is 552 ACNS/SCXC, Configuration
        Management. This office is responsible for receiving and tracking all CSCRs, forwarding
        them to the appropriate program manager, and providing feedback as necessary. All
        CSCRs must be submitted to this office.
3. Procedures. All proposed changes and requests submitted to 552 ACNS/SCXC will be
processed under one or more of the following CSCR types:
     3.1. Program Incident Report (PIR), 552 ACW 6. A PIR identifies a suspected software error
     and may be initiated by any individual responsible for operating, maintaining, or observing
     any software driven system. See Attachment 2 for format.
     3.2. Program Error Report (PER), 552 ACW 2. A PER identifies a confirmed software error
     and may only be initiated by a programmer/analyst associated with software support. If the
     confirmed software error was originally reported in a PIR, the PIR will be closed and a PER
     will be initiated by the analyzing organization. See Attachment 3 for format.
     3.3. System Design Request (SDR), 552 ACW 2. An SDR identifies a proposed change to
     improve system performance or program design. Any individual associated with a system
     may initiate an SDR. See Attachment 4 for format.
     3.4. Document Error Report (DER), 552 ACW 7. A DER identifies an error in
     documentation and may be submitted by any individual associated with a system. See
     Attachment 5 for format.
     3.5. E-3 Database Change Request (DBCR), 552 ACW 8. A DBCR will be used to initiate
     changes to contents of the E-3 operational databases (ESM, JTIDS, Map, or Calculated
     Adaptation Data (CAF) as required to improve the operational effectiveness of the E-3
     system. See Attachment 6 for format.
     3.6. E-3 Database Change Request (DBCR) Deployed, 552 ACW 9. A DBCR-Deployed will
     be used to initiate changes to contents of the E-3 operational databases (ESM, JTIDS, Map,
     or Calculated Adaptation Data (CAF) as required to improve the operational effectiveness of
     the E-3 system. See Attachment 7 for format.
3.7. Trouble Incident Report (TIR). A TIR is used to document Trouble Reports (TRs)
generated during interoperability testing of AOCP. See Attachment 8.

routed through 552 ACNS/SCXP, prior to being sent to 552 ACNS/SCXC. The use of acronyms
and jargon should be avoided. A PIR may be converted to a PER, SDR, or DER by the analyzing
organization should further analysis/action be necessary.

when program version/ subversions are released. However, if the number or importance of
corrections warrants, the DER may be used as the authority to make out-of-cycle changes to the
affected document(s). The originator must review the DER for classification purposes and
properly mark with classification markings before submitting.
A5.3. FORMAT. 552 ACW 7, Document Error Report, will be used to initiate a DER.

                         TROUBLE INCIDENT REPORT (TIR)

A8.1. PURPOSE. The TIR is used to document Trouble Reports (TR) generated during
interoperability testing of AOCP.
A8.2. INITIATION. A TIR is initiated by the external test section (552 ACNS/SCTE) upon
receipt of a TR from an interoperability test. This is done by forwarding the TR to the
configuration management section (552 ACNS/SCXC). The configuration management section
assigns a tracking number to the TIR and forwards to the AOCP project manager for analysis.
The external test section is the only office that can initiate a TIR.
A8.3. FORMAT. The information boxes on the TTR form are self explanatory.

Table A9.1. CSCR PRIORITY SCHEME.
Priority   Applies if a problem could:
      1    a. Prevent the accomplishment of an operational or mission essential capability. b.
           Jeopardize safety, security, or other requirements designated "critical."


      2    a. Adversely affect the accomplishment of an operational or mission essential capability,
           and no work-around solution is known. b. Adversely affect technical, cost, or schedule
           risks to the project or to life cycle support of the system, and no work-around solution is
           known.


      3    a. Adversely affect the accomplishment of an operational or mission essential capability,
           but a work-around solution is known. b. Adversely affect technical, cost, or schedule risks
           to the project or to life cycle support of the system, but a work-around solution is known.



      4    a. Result in user/operator inconvenience or annoyance, but does not affect a required
           operational or mission essential capability. b. Result in inconvenience or annoyance for
           development or support personnel, but does not prevent the accomplishment of those
           responsibilities.


      5    Any other effect.



Priority 1 = Emergency Priority 2 = Urgent Priorities 3-5 = Routine.
