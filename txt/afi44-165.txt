SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This AFI has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: changing the title of this AFI and clarifying the support requirements for the Military
Treatment Facility (MTF). It also describes the En Route Patient Staging System (ERPSS)
capabilities and configurations, adjusts the scope of care and functions of the ERPSS, phases of
deployment and updates forms, abbreviations and acronyms. Changes to this document also
include the deletion of Global Expeditionary Medical System (GEMS), the addition of the
Theater Medical Information Program (TMIP), and includes eliminating the Defense Message
System (DMS) program. The Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC) will no longer
provide DMS services for official messaging to AF organizations. Alternative message
coordination methods will be organizational Common Access Card (CAC) Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) signed and encrypted e-mail on the Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router
Network (NIPRNET) and organizational e-mail on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network
(SIPRNET). “How to” information has been removed from this instruction and added to the

                                           Chapter 1

                   EN ROUTE PATIENT STAGING SYSTEM (ERPSS)

1.1. Mission Overview. The ERPSS has a two-fold mission: to provide support and continuity
of medical care for patient movement (PM) IAW AFI 41-307, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient
Considerations and Standards of Care, and serve as an integral patient interface to the En Route
Care Capability (ERCC). The ERPSS provides personnel and equipment necessary for 24-hour
patient staging operations, patient transportation to/from aircraft, and administrative processes
for tracking patients transiting the ERCC worldwide. Note: The ERPSS has no surgical, lab,
dental, mental health, x-ray, or blood bank capabilities. Thus, it should be co-located with an
MTF capable of providing required inpatient and outpatient services. Critically ill patients and
inpatient psychiatric patients must be staged/held at the co-located or supporting MTF. The co-
located or supporting inpatient MTF is responsible for holding/staging all patients with medical
care requirements outside the scope of the ERPSS. (T-2)
1.2. En Route Patient Staging Facility. The staging facility is a key healthcare component of
the ERCC, and provides temporary holding capability for patients transiting the system. All
ERPSS facilities (with the exception of the tactical ERPSS 10) should be co-located with a
bedded facility in order to maximize its capability to care for patients. Primary medical/surgical
and other ancillary services must be available 24 hours/day for patients in the staging facility.
(T-2) If the staging facility is not co-located with an MTF that can provide the required clinical
support, arrangements must be in place to meet the clinical support levels needed for patients
transiting the facility. (T-3)
   1.2.1. The ERPSS Control Center will communicate directly with the Staging Facility OIC
   any changes to the patient manifest or patient condition to ensure the most current medical
   information is available to the AE crew. (T-3)
1.3. Interface Requirements. The leadership element of the ERPSS (Officer in Charge (OIC),
Senior Flight Surgeon, Administrator, and Chief Nurse) will: (T-3)
   1.3.1. Coordinate with the supporting MTF to establish administrative, ancillary service, and
   clinical support requirements. (T-3)
   1.3.2. Establish communications with the appropriate Patient Movement Requirements
   Center (PMRC), 618th Air Operations Center/Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) and
   appropriate Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Squadron(s). (T-2) The ERPSS – 10 Team Chief
   may request the sourcing of a flight nurse (e.g. pare and tailor line 001 from UTC FFQLL,
   AE Liaison Team [AELT]), to serve as liaison between the ERPSS -10 and the AE system.
   1.3.3. Establish communications with all supported service tactical evacuation assets/units.
   (T-2)
   1.3.4. Establish communications with all MTFs moving patients to the ERPSS to ensure
   transportation and continuity of patient care is maintained. (T-2)
   1.3.5. Establish communications with the base commander (deployed) and airfield manager.
   The ERPSS leadership team should also develop a relationship with the Air Terminal
   Operations Center (ATOC), Civil Engineering (CE), communications, transportation, dining

    facilities (DFAC), flight safety, fire and force protection units. These units should be
    notified of the presence of a Staging Facility on the base and the mission support
    requirements inherent in the patient movement system. (T-3)

AFI44-165 28 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   11


3.8. Training.
   3.8.1. Unit training and deployment requirements will be maintained IAW AFI 41-106
   Medical Readiness Program Management. The staging mission is a unique role integral to
   the successful movement of patients. All personnel assigned to an ERPSS UTC will attend
   the Aeromedical Evacuation and Patient Staging Course (AEPSC) at Camp Bullis, TX.
   Individual readiness skills verification (RSV) and other AFSC-specific training requirements
   will be current prior to attending AEPSC training. Training requirements will be current
   prior to deployment. Smaller personnel packages supporting expeditionary operations will
   require personnel to perform a variety of functions (multi-tasking) which may not be in their
   specific AFSC responsibilities. Accordingly, training shall emphasize a breadth of talents,
   skills and be appropriate to the mission. A flexible approach to patient care, movement,
   staging, administration, facility management, and security is essential for success. (T-2)
   AFI 41-106 remains the governing AFI for ERPSS training.

   through the Operations Group to the AF Reach Back office at Port San Antonio, Texas. Port
   San Antonio will remain the initial source supply until mature DoD logistical supply chains
   are established. Once the theater has sustained operations, the Theater Lead Agent for
   Medical Materiel (TLAMM) system will become the source for all joint medical supply
   needs. Fixed Staging Facilities will be supported by the base MTF. (T-2)
3.10. Patient Movement Items (PMI).
   3.10.1. All Medical personnel must be familiar with the many aspects of the theater’s PMI
   program, to include obtaining, storing, maintenance, tracking, and recycling practices of the
   PMI commodities. The PMI Tracking System is the Joint tool for asset visibility and
   essential for timely AE equipment recycle support to prevent degradation of forward element
   medical capability. Personnel must work with the AE community in tracking assets for
   optimal use. Guidance for PMI is located in AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics Support.
   3.10.2. AMC/SG is the Manpower Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) Responsible
   Agency (MRA) for the Global PMI Program and will provide funding, management direction
   and oversight in support of PMI Centers, PMI operational support, PMI training platforms
   and will develop and maintain the PMI Concept of Operations (CONOPS). (T-2)

ERPSS personnel will notify the PMRC of interruption of PM. (T-2)
4.9. Remain overnight (RON) in the MTF or other agency. If patients need to RON in the
MTF or other agency while transiting the ERCC, they need not be formally admitted to the MTF.
The MTF flight surgeon or designee will manage the medical care of such patients and will
reaffirm their readiness for flight. Patients in RON status at a civilian medical facility may be
admitted, but the ERPSS will retain them as ERPSS RON patients. (T-3)
4.10. Flight Surgeon.
   4.10.1. Post patient arrival to the staging facility, the Flight surgeon will review the patient’s
   records, prescribed medications, treatments, diet and special interest items and address any
   current medical complaints. Assessment findings and orders for any new medications and/or
   treatments will be documented on the patient’s AF Form 3899. The Flight Surgeon will
   determine whether each patient can remain in the staging facility or must be transferred to the
   supporting MTF for medical care. If the determination is made that the patient needs to be
   transferred or RON, coordination with the MTF Chief of Medical Services will occur. Note:
   A flight surgeon will evaluate and document the patient's condition every 24 hours, will
   consult with medical specialists as needed and will be available on a 24-hour basis. All
   entries will be recorded in ZULU time (example: 1837Z or 0245Z). (T-2)
