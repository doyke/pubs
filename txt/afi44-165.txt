                                               Chapter 1

                     AEROMEDICAL STAGING FACILITY COMPOSITION

1.1. Mission. The Aeromedical Staging Facility (ASF) Mission.
    1.1.1. The ASF has a two-fold mission: To provide support and continuity of medical care for patient
    movement and serve as an integral link in the Global Aeromedical Evacuation system. NOTE: The
    ASF has no surgical, lab, dental, x-ray or blood bank capabilities. It is designed for short-term com-
    plex medical-surgical nursing care and limited emergent intervention. Critically ill patients will
    receive care at the nearest MTF or by the Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT) at the ASF
    while awaiting airlift.
    1.1.2. Patients with active Global Patient Movement Requirements Center (GPMRC) or Joint Patient
    Movement Requirement Center (JPMRC) cite numbers and medical/non-medical attendants may
    transit through the ASF.

1.2. Types of ASFs. There are three types of ASFs: Fixed, Contingency, and Mobile.
    1.2.1. Fixed: A Fixed ASF (FASF) is a permanent facility and may be co-located or geographically
    separated from a permanent MTF, and as such will require administrative and logistical support from
    that treatment facility. The FASF will support current contingencies by expanding resources used dur-
    ing peacetime operations. FASF personnel provide complex medical-surgical nursing care and admin-
    istrative processing in accordance with Department of Defense (DOD), Air Force (AF) standards of
    health care.
    1.2.2. Contingency: A Contingency ASF (CASF) is a modular and expeditionary concept that sup-
    ports the full spectrum of contingency operations including Operational Plans (OPLANS), the Inte-
    grated CONUS Medical Operations Plan (ICMOP), Homeland Defense (HLD), and Humanitarian
    Relief Operations (HUMRO) at the time of execution. (Logistics and designated equipment, are capa-
    ble of sustaining 24-hour operations). CASFs are staffed with medical, administrative and logistics
    personnel - including designated equipment - that is capable of sustaining 24-hour operations. Equip-
    ment and personnel Unit Type Codes (UTC) assigned to Reserve and Active Duty units will provide
    capabilities to operate CASFs of given bed capacities. Employed CASFs coordinate with all service
    medical and transportation elements to accomplish patient movement. CASFs provide patient recep-
    tion, complex medical-surgical nursing care, limited emergent intervention and ensure that patients
    are medically and administratively prepared for medical evacuation. Patients requiring extensive
    medical treatment or critical nursing care will remain in the MTF until arrangements have been made
    for transfer.
    1.2.3. Mobile: A Mobile ASF (MASF) is a deployable, tented asset for temporary staging, casualty
    care and administration support during contingency operations. It is located near runways or taxiways
    of forward air heads, operating bases used by tactical airlift or designated transportation hubs. This
    mission is to support the tactical interface between service MTFs and medical evacuation. MASF
    holding capability is 2-6 hours for patients entering the patient movement system. The MASF requires
    logistical and administrative support from the supporting base. (MASFs do not have physicians).

1.3. ASFs. Aside from the fixed ASF, the CASF or MASF may operate from buildings of opportunity or
tents (See Attachment 2) to support the AE/patient movement mission and is usually located on or near
AFI44-165 6 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                                5


an airfield in close proximity to an aircraft-parking ramp. ASFs provide personnel and equipment neces-
sary for 24-hour staging operations, patient transportation to aircraft and administratively processes
patients transiting the AE system worldwide. The ASF coordinates and communicates with medical and
transportation elements to accomplish patient care and patient movement, including ground transportation
for patients entering, transiting, or leaving the AE system.
   1.3.1. The ASF can be co-located with an MTF, but may be geographically separated to support AE
   mission requirements. If the distance from the MTF to ASF is determined by the Chief of Medical
   Services to be significant, emergent care personnel, (such as a CCATT) may be co-located with the
   ASF to assist in stabilizing patients. NOTE: If geographically separated, the ASF will require admin-
   istrative and logistical assistance from supporting bases or service agencies. (i.e. orderly room, base
   supply etc.
   1.3.2. The ASF is a key healthcare component of the AE or other medical evacuation resources. It
   provides holding capability for patients transiting the patient movement system. NOTE: The length of
   stay in the ASF may be from 24-72 hours.
   1.3.3. The CASF/MASF utilizes War Reserve Materiel (WRM) supply and equipment assets that may
   be pre-positioned. The ASF deploys with an initial 7 day supply of expendable items. Expeditionary
   Medical Logistics provides timely re-supply of ordered items to deployed medical units. Orders will
   flow from the deployed unit through the Operations Group to the CONUS Sustaining Base. The
   CONUS Sustaining Base receives orders from deployed units and takes necessary actions to ensure
   100% of all orders are transmitted to vendors/depots, are immediately purchased, packed, marked,
   and shipped so that the materiel is received by the deployed unit. Once the theater has sustained oper-
   ations, the Single Integrated Medical Logistics Management (SIMLM) system will become the source
   for joint medical supply needs. (Fixed ASFs will be supported by the base MTF).
   1.3.4. Depending on the type of ASF, the ASF personnel include flight surgeons, nurses, medical
   technicians, medical logistics technicians, mental health nurses and technicians, pharmacy techni-
   cians, nutritional medicine technicians, and biomedical repair personnel.

1.4. Operations. The ASF may be located at major AE/medical evacuation interface points within the
theater at tactical or strategic air hubs. Upon notification of impending deployment, the commander of the
deploying ASF will coordinate with the Medical Readiness Officer and accomplish a pre-deployment
review of key documents and responsibilities. The Execution Order (EXORD)/Operational Order
(OPORD) identifies Operational Control (OPCON), Tactical Control (TACON), Administrative Control
(ADCON), mission objectives, rules of engagement, force protection, handling of classified information,
hazardous cargo, and other mission specific requirements for the deployment. The theater combatant
commander’s redeployment order authorizes the redeployment of medical resources.

1.5. Interface with Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF). Upon arrival at the deployed location, the
command element of the ASF (Commander, Chief of Medical Services, Administrator, and Chief Nurse)
will contact appropriate Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC), sister service tactical evacua-
tion assets/units, and shall attempt to contact all MTFs that will be moving patients to the ASF to ensure
transportation and continuity of patient care is maintained. In addition to medical relationships, the Base
Commander and Airfield Manager should be contacted to coordinate Base Operating Support (BOS) e.g.
Air Transport Operations Center (ATOC), Civil Engineering, Communications, Transportation, Dining
6                                                                       AFI44-165 6 NOVEMBER 2007


Facilities (DFAC), flight safety, and Fire and Force Protection units should be notified of the presence of
an ASF on the base.

1.6. Medical Reports and Communication. All medical intelligence reports are submitted in accor-
dance with AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting and specific combatant commander, Joint Task Force
(JTF) and Air Force Forces (AFFOR) guidance.
    1.6.1. The Medical Readiness Contingency Report (MEDRED-C) is a status report for emergencies,
    disasters and contingencies. This report is accomplished daily and communicated to the AFFOR sur-
    geon, contributing Major Command (MAJCOM) surgeons and the AF Surgeon General. It is an
    on-site assessment of the deployed medical unit’s ability to complete its mission. This report provides
    information on the operational readiness status, unit availability, and patient care activities of Air
    Force Medical Service (AFMS) units on alert for contingency operations or which have come under
    the influence of an unusual occurrence (natural disaster or other emergencies). Refer to AFI 10-206,
    Operational Reporting.
    1.6.2. The Situation Report (SITREP) will be completed by the deployed medical commander (senior
    medical officer) to provide daily medical input for inclusion in the deployed wing’s SITREP. Data is
    used to make operational decisions on medical support forces and to perform medical intelligence
    analyses during contingency operations. FASFs, CASFs and MASFs may be required to provide
    information for this report. Refer to AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, Chapter 4 for further guid-
    ance.

1.7. Scope of Care. ASFs are an intermediate level of care facility. Critically ill patients will be cared for
at either the nearest medical treatment facility with required capability or on a short-term basis by CCATT
at the ASF location for patients awaiting airlift. ASF personnel provide complex medical-surgical nursing
care and administrative processing for all patients transiting the AE system. ASF personnel will:
    1.7.1. Stage, enplane and deplane patients
    1.7.2. Receive regulated patients and provide continuing and supportive care
    1.7.3. Prepare and “clear patients for flight” to ensure suitability for AE under the guidance of the
    PMRC validating flight surgeon
    1.7.4. Brief patients and accomplish appropriate documentation and TRAC2ES inputs
    1.7.5. Provide ground transportation between the ASF and the aircraft
    1.7.6. Provide facility security for the protection of assets, personnel and entry control

     2.9.1. The flight surgeon will review the patient’s record, prescribed treatment and diet, and address
     any current medical complaints upon arrival with appropriate documentation on the patient’s AF
     Form 3899. The flight surgeon will determine if the patient can begin or continue travel in the patient
     movement system and coordinate status with appropriate PMRC and Medical Crew Director (MCD).
     NOTE: A flight surgeon will evaluate the patient's condition every 24 hours, will consult with medical
     specialists as needed, and will be available on a 24 hour basis.
     2.9.2. For extensive documentation, use Standard Form 600, Health Record-Chronological, or other
     locally approved forms. Attach all forms to the AF Form 3899 and transport with the patient.
     2.9.3. Doctor's Orders. Physicians will order enroute treatment on continuation sheets attached to the

2.10. Nursing Services.
     2.10.1. ASF nursing services document all patient care on AF Form 3899. All entries will be recorded
     in ZULU time (example: 1837Z or 0245Z). Charting is required upon admission, once a shift and
     upon discharge from ASF at a minimum. Triage starts with review of the patient manifest and PMR
     and continues through the patient’s arrival and nursing report. The flight surgeon with assistance of
     the ASF nurse determines whether each patient can remain in the ASF or must be transferred to the
     MTF for medical care. Ensure all patients have a patient identification, ID bracelet. Bracelet will
     include last name, first name, middle initial, last five of SSN (printed or typed).
AFI44-165 6 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                               11

  3899 or PMR.
  2.10.3. Patients will not self medicate with controlled medications. It will be the responsibility of the
  medical personnel in each patient care area (user service, CASF, AE crews, ASF and destination
  MTF) to administer controlled medications to their patient population. Documentation will be charted
  in ZULU time on the AF Form 3899. If patient arrives without an AF Form 3899, for example, arrives
  with a DD Form 602, Patient Evacuation Tag or a DD Form 1380, US Field Medical Card, informa-
  tion from those documents will be transcribed onto an AF Form 3899 and the original documentation
  will be attached to the AF Form 3899 and will become a permanent part of the patient’s medical
  record.
     2.10.3.1. Patients may self medicate with non controlled medication only when designated by the
     flight surgeon. Self medication orders will be documented on the AF Form 3899. The ASF nurse
     with assistance from pharmacy personnel, when available, will provide an adequate supply of
     medications and an AF Form 3861, Medication Record for identifying dosages and schedules for
     self administered medication. (intra-theater movement requires a 3 day minimum supply;
     inter-theater movement requires a 5 day minimum supply). During time of war, intra and inter-the-
     ater medication supply levels will be based on command directives. Pharmacy technician will pro-
     vide patient with instruction and information regarding their prescribed medication. Education
     will be documented on the AF Form 3899.
     2.10.3.2. Provide AF IMT Form 78l, Multiple Item Description, as required to fill an inpatient
     narcotic prescription request. AF IMT Form 781 should be completed by the attending physician.
  2.10.4. Prior to departing the ASF, the patient will be assessed for pain and, if required, administered
  medication within one hour of departure. If possible, delay administering diuretics until after flight.
  2.10.5. Narcotics that are unaccounted for will be turned into the pharmacy and documented on AF
  IMT Form 3859, Turn-In of Unaccompanied Narcotics.
     2.10.5.1. If controlled medication is stored at a remote location other than a pharmacy, i.e., nurses
     station, an ASF nurse and another qualified person must count narcotics at change of shift and
     document on AF IMT Form 579, Controlled Substance Register.
  2.10.6. When preparing patients for departure the ASF nurse will include as attachment, the Patient
  Preparation Checklist.
  2.10.7. Place all medical records (clinical records, outpatient treatment records, X-rays, and any other
  pertinent patient information) in an envelope. The following information will be printed on the outside
  of each patient envelope:

                                    FACILITY MANAGEMENT

3.1. Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) and the Co-located ASF.
   3.1.1. Medical Support. The MTF provides the co-located ASF with medical, administrative, logisti-
   cal, pharmaceutical, nutritional medicine, radiology and other support services as needed. (Unless
   otherwise designated, the Director of Aerospace Medicine has oversight of clinical ASF functions).
   3.1.2. Administrative and Logistical Support. The originating or enroute MTF provides medical
   materiel support for patients transiting the continuum of medical care. The MTF shall provide sup-
   plies, equipment, linen, and custodial services and the subsequent accounting for such materiel: IAW
   AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics Support.
   3.1.3. Resource Management. The MTF Resource Management Office (RMO) will include reports
   from the co-located ASF as part of the MTF's reporting requirements. The MTF will assist the ASF
   with personnel, Unit Manning Documentation (UMD), funding requests and requirements and other
   services as needed.
   3.1.4. TRAC2ES. The MTF will support network and terminal connectivity to TRAC2ES providing
   patient demographic, transportation and clinical information.
   3.1.5. Operational Footprint. The MTF will ensure the ASF has enough physical space to accommo-
   date patient loads, infection control processes, readiness requirements and AE mission or transporta-
   tion surges.
   3.1.6. Vehicles. The MTF vehicle control officer will provide appropriate vehicles for ASF transpor-
   tation needs and will serve as the liaison to the vehicle operations flight.
   3.1.7. Orderly room. The MTF will provide standard orderly room services in support of disciplinary
   actions, career training and leave monitoring.
   3.1.8. The MTF will provide trained personnel for patient loading teams as required.
   3.1.9. Scope of Care. ASF personnel provide complex medical-surgical nursing care for patients who
   have been transferred to the ASF awaiting transportation. Patients on life support systems or cardiac
   monitors, psychiatric patients and homicidal or suicidal patients are provided care in adjacent civilian
   facilities or MTF.
   3.1.10. Patient movement process is initiated by the MTF by entering patient information into
   TRAC2ES in the form of a Patient Movement Request (PMR). The PMR is then regulated through the
   appropriate Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC). Information available on the PMR
   includes:
       3.1.10.1. Flight number
       3.1.10.2. Aircraft tail number
       3.1.10.3. Information in TRAC2ES is subject to change on short notice based on current opera-
       tional requirements. Changes are updated as quickly as possible, but the PMR may not reflect the
       most current information available. The MCC will be in contact with the PMRC to ensure the lat-
16                                                                      AFI44-165 6 NOVEMBER 2007


        est information is provided to staff, but some changes do not get communicated until a flight
        arrives on station.
        3.1.10.4. Estimated departure time on originating flights
        3.1.10.5. Patient classifications, diagnoses, and requirements for special equipment, diets, ambu-
        lance or personnel
     3.1.11. Releasing Patients from the AE System. See AFI 41-301, Worldwide Aeromedical Evacuation
     System, provides the current guidance on policies and procedures.
        3.1.11.1. Placing Patients on Medical Hold. In the event of changes in the patient’s condition, the
        Flight Surgeon may place a patient on medical hold, not to exceed 72 hours. Patients with severe
        conditional changes may require admission to an MTF whereupon the flight surgeon will arrange
        for hospitalization. ASF personnel will notify the PMRC of interruption of patient movement.
        NOTE: Patients who are removed from the AE system may not resume travel on their original
        TRAC2ES cite number.
        3.1.11.2. RON in the MTF or Other Agency. All RON patients are census assets of the ASF. If
        patients need to RON in the MTF or other agency while transiting patient movement system, they
        shall not be formally admitted to the MTF. The MTF flight surgeon or designee will manage the
        medical care of such patients and will reaffirm their readiness for flight. Patients in RON status at
        a civilian medical facility may be admitted, but the ASF will retain them as ASF RON patients.

                    CONTINGENCY AEROMEDICAL STAGING FACILITY

4.1. CASF will follow ASF guidelines in previous chapters where applicable.
   4.1.1. CASF Mission. The CASF is a unique, modular aeromedical staging facility that is designed to
   support world-wide expeditionary contingencies while itself is supported by a level 3 MTF or higher.
   The CASF personnel package is composed of three building block UTCs that are combined in various
   ways to customize the CASF depending on nature and size of mission requirement. It provides patient
   reception, complex medical-surgical nursing care, limited emergent intervention, and ensures patients
   are medically and administratively prepared for flight. For planning purposes patient holding times
   range from 12 hours to 72 hours depending on aircraft availability and patient status. The build-
   ing-block approach of the CASF allows its size to be scaled according to medical needs, changing
   requirements, and airlift availability. CASFs can be deployed anywhere in the world. CASFs support
   combatant commanders, humanitarian/disaster relief operations, the ICMOP and/or potentially home-
   land security/defense/disaster response missions. Additionally, CASF equipment is composed of four
   UTCs that can be sized to support the mission requirements. Configurations range from the
   CASF-BASIC to a CASF+250, with appropriate increases in personnel and equipment.
      4.1.1.1. Clinical Nursing Function UTC (FFVNF). This 24 personnel UTC provides the clinical
      care components to the CASF and is the only UTC that can be deployed independently in support
      of CASF-BASIC. FFVNF includes a nurse administrator, clinical nurses, medical technicians, and
      limited technical services, and an administrative technician. Administrative duties are limited to
      patient support and patient movement. Larger CASF builds require deployment of this UTC in
      combination with other UTCs to form the various packages. See Attachment 3.
      4.1.1.2. Command Function UTC (FFVCF). This twelve 12 person UTC package contains per-
      sonnel with the knowledge, skills, and experience of the patient movement system, and command,
      communications, and control for a CASF+25 for independent medical care and support. This UTC
      brings health service administration (MSCs), flight surgeon, physician assistant, mental health
      nurse, medical services superintendent, logistics, biomedical equipment repair (BMET), phar-
      macy, and mental health technician support for the mission. It is utilized in building CASF+25,
      +50, +100, and +250 size facilities. It is absent in the CASF-BASIC package since these services
      are provided by the co-located MTF, whether a fixed CONUS or deployed MTF such as EMEDS.
      If BOS is limited, planners should add provisions for personnel with expertise in aircraft ground
      equipment (AGE) setup and management for generator, electrical grid and lighting. See Attach-
      ment 3.
   4.1.2. CASF-BASIC (Nursing function). CASF-BASIC must be co-located with the medical facility.
   CASF-BASIC is not equipped for independent medical care and provides only ward support and/or
   medical billeting for patients transiting the patient movement system. CASF-BASIC provides com-
   plex medical-surgical nursing care only and relies on the attached medical facility for dietary, logis-
   tics, pharmacy, mental health, physician and administrative services. These functions will be provided
   by a co-located DoD contingency MTF or CONUS level-3 MTF in support of the COCOM mission.
   4.1.3. CASF+25 (Command function). The command function deploys when medical care beyond
   complex medical-surgical nursing care for a 25-bed configuration is necessary. The CASF+25 pro-
   vides physician care and additional support for administrative, biomedical equipment repair, logistics,
18                                                                    AFI44-165 6 NOVEMBER 2007


     pharmacy, and mental health functions. CASF+25 requires support for dietary, and critical care nurs-
     ing.
     4.1.4. CASF+50 Consists of a 50-bed configuration with the same support services as the CASF+25.
     4.1.5. CASF+100 (Specialty function). Dietary and critical care nursing services are included in a
     100-bed configuration. A CASF+100 is capable of functioning on a more independent level, and
     although utilizes MTF logistics supply line, medical waste management services, and ancillary ser-
     vices is able to function geographically separated from the MTF's.

4.2. Operations. The CASF may be located at major AE or other transportation/patient movement inter-
face points within the theater at tactical or strategic transportation hubs. Upon notification of impending
deployment, the unit CASF commander will coordinate with the Medical Readiness Officer and accom-
plish a pre-deployment review of key documents and responsibilities. The EXORD/OPORD identifies
OPCON, TACON, ADCON, mission objectives, rules of engagement, force protection, handling of clas-
sified information, hazardous cargo, and other mission specific requirements for the deployment. The the-
ater combatant commander’s redeployment order authorizes the redeployment of medical resources.

4.3. Interface with MTF. Upon arrival at the deployed location, the command element of the CASF
(Commander, Chief of Medical Services, Administrator, and Chief Nurse) shall contact all MTFs that will
be moving patients to the CASF in the AE/transportation system in order to coordinate transportation and
continuation of patient care. The executive team must also be familiar with the deployed environment’s
patient movement items (PMI) program for obtaining and tracking the elements essential to AE opera-
tions. Theater policy should be indicated in the OPLANS. In addition to medical relationships, the base
commander and airfield manager should be contacted to coordinate BOS (e.g. Air Transport Operations
Center [ATOC], Civil Engineering, Communications, Transportation, DFAC and flight safety), and fire
and force protection units should be notified of the presence of a CASF on the base.

4.4. Command and Control.
     4.4.1. The CASF will be designated a squadron under the expeditionary or fixed medical group Com-
     mander. A CASF-BASIC shall be under the command of the EMEDS/MTF Commander and follow
     the EMEDS/MTF command structure as outlined in the OPORD.
     4.4.2. The CASF will fall under TACON of the Air Force AEW/AEG Commander or the commander
     of the MTF (if other than Air Force) in accordance with the OPORD, which will define specific com-
     mand relationships. OPCON will remain with the theater Air Force commander. For AFRC personnel,
     under full mobilization, full ADCON authority goes to the Commander of the Air Force Forces
     (COMAFFOR). Under less than full mobilization, the COMAFFOR receives specified ADCON that
     includes Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) authority, force protection requirements, and other
     specified authorities written in G-series orders. AFRC retains all other ADCON authorities (AFTTP
     3-42.1). Intelligence reports, including medical intelligence, will be forwarded through the medical
     group. All medical reports such as MEDRED-C and SITREPS are submitted in accordance with AFI
     10-206, Operational Reporting and specific combatant commander, JTF, and AFFOR guidance
     according to MAJCOM directives.
     4.4.3. The senior CCATT member will coordinate with the CASF commander for optimal patient care
     and mission efficiency; however C2 for CCATT personnel will remain with the Aeromedical Evacua-
     tion Squadron commander, IAW CCATT CONOPS.
AFI44-165 6 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                                 19


4.5. Communications/Computer Systems Support. The CASF will deploy with radio equipment that
will be operated by CASF personnel. The radio equipment will be the Air Force current model and type
with appropriate encryption capability as defined by the combatant commander. This radio system is
operationally focused to manage intra-CASF communications and support flight line patient movement
operations. Support for this radio system will be required from base and/or expeditionary combat support
communication resources for initial setup as well as ongoing support for telephone, local area network
(LAN), and internet and worldwide web access. Health services technicians and senior leaders should be
trained in the application and operation of required systems, including, but not limited to Global Emer-
gency Management System (GEMS), TRAC2ES, Secure Telephone Equipment (STE), Defense Messag-
ing System (DMS), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), Global Decision Support
System (GDSS) and Security Management System (SMS).

4.6. Security. CASF personnel and equipment are non-combatant assets, though personnel may be
armed as dictated by theater instructions. Facility security for asset protection and entry control, personal
protection, and patient protection is performed by armed CASF personnel IAW the Laws of Armed Con-
flict and Geneva Conventions. Security for CASF personnel and patients against enemy aggressors is the
responsibility of the host unit.
   4.6.1. Upon arrival, the CASF/CC will establish Plans, Policies, Procedures and Processes (P4) for
   Weapons Handling and Storage Procedures. (Weapons are defined as: Any device which may be used
   to inflict injury or death to include (but not limited to) firearms, explosives, ammunition, and knives
   (Including multi-purpose tools, aircrew knives, etc). See AFI 31-301 Air Base Defense for additional
   guidance). P4 for weapons handling and storage procedures will include:
       4.6.1.1. Ensuring the proper control of weapons when temporarily stored in the facility
       4.6.1.2. Outlining the proper storage and distribution procedures for weapons that are CASF
       assets. Establish secure site for CASF defensive weapons and ammunition
       4.6.1.3. Establishing clear policies defining personnel authorized to carry weapons: members of
       Security Forces (SF) or Military Police (MP) performing official duties are authorized to carry a
       firearm while in the CASF. CASF Commander or Wing Commander may issue written authoriza-
       tion to other individuals with specific mission requirements to carry weapons into the CASF.
       4.6.1.4. Determining and establishing a secure weapons storage area and log. Ensure that persons
       unauthorized to carry firearms or other weapons in the facility are identified and disarmed
   4.6.2. P4 will be implemented relative to the establishment and supervision of entry control points
   (ECP) to include entry, exit and firearm management. ECP policy will include:
       4.6.2.1. Personnel identification (photo ID, passwords, protective barriers, etc)
       4.6.2.2. Positioning of clearing barrel, and weapons
       4.6.2.3. Collection, securing and storing patient weapons to include firearms, grenades and explo-
       sives. Weapons will be identified and inventoried using AF IMT 1297
       4.6.2.4. Establishing and managing the disposal of collected weapons and ammunition with Secu-
       rity Forces and/or armory
   4.6.3. P4 will be established for the temporary storing of weapons for redeploying CASF personnel to
   include:
20                                                                     AFI44-165 6 NOVEMBER 2007


        4.6.3.1. Securing and reclaiming weapons to and from Security Forces
        4.6.3.2. Securing weapons in approved travel case or storage
     4.6.4. P4 will be firmly established regarding the issuance of firearms to unexploded ordinance
     (UXO) sweep teams, to include:
        4.6.4.1. Number of weapons and ammunition issued to CASF members
        4.6.4.2. Ascertaining the weapons qualification of the individual.
        4.6.4.3. Proper loading and clearing of weapons

4.7. Force Protection. Civil Engineering has the primary responsibility to provide facility hardening for
the CASF and ancillary structures associated with the CASF (e.g. logistics storage, laundry, latrines,
anti-hijacking areas, patient leisure areas). In the event CE does not provide support, CASF personnel will
harden their own facilities. See AFMAN 10-100 for additional guidance.

4.8. Anti-Hijacking. Anti-hijacking measures will be accomplished on any patients, non-medical atten-
dants, and/or baggage transiting the ASF. CASF personnel will deploy with appropriate personal protec-
tive equipment (PPE), including helmet, eye shields, gloves and interceptor vests; and wear the PPE while
performing anti-hijacking duties.

4.9. Training. Unit training and deployment requirements will be maintained IAW AFI 41-106 Medical
Readiness Planning and Training and AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual. The CASF mission is a unique
role integral to the successful movement of patients. All personnel assigned to CASF (FFVCF, FFVNF &
FFVSF) will attend CASF course at Sheppard AFB TX within their training window before their AEF
bucket of assignment is in the window for deployment cycle. Individual readiness skills verification
(RSVs) and other AFSC-specific training requirements will be current prior to attending CASF training.
Training requirements will be current prior to deployment. Smaller personnel packages supporting expe-
ditionary operations will require personnel to perform a variety of functions (multi-tasking) which may
not be in their specific AFSC responsibilities. Accordingly, training shall emphasize a breadth of talents,
skills and be appropriate to the mission. A flexible approach to patient care, movement, staging, adminis-
tration, facility management, and security is essential for success. AFI 41-106 remains the governing AFI
for CASF training.

4.10. Expeditionary Medical Logistics.
     4.10.1. Expeditionary Medical Logistics. Orders will flow from the deployed unit through the opera-
     tions group to the CONUS sustaining base. The CONUS sustaining base receives orders from
     deployed units and takes necessary actions to ensure 100% of all orders are transmitted to vendors/
     depots, are immediately purchased, packed, marked, and shipped so that the materiel is received by
     the deployed unit. The Single Integrated Medical Logistics Management (SIMLM) system is the
     source for joint medical supply needs. Until SIMLM is fully implemented, additional FFVS1 CASF
     expendable medical supply packages could be utilized for re-supply of expendable items. The re-sup-
     ply chain of medical and administrative equipment and expendable materials will follow the normal
     channels through the affiliated MTF.
     4.10.2. The facility manager is responsible for making arrangements for proper disposal of biomedi-
     cal (red bag) waste with the EMEDS or the MTF.
AFI44-165 6 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                            21


   4.10.3. Medical logistics personnel must be familiar with the many aspects of the theater’s PMI pro-
   gram, to include obtaining, storing, maintenance, tracking, and recycling practices of the PMI com-
   modity. Asset visibility is essential for timely AE support to prevent degradation of forward element
   medical capability. Personnel must work with the AE community in tracking assets for optimal utili-
   zation.
