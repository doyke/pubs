1.13.5. (Added)) The base vehicle management function is funded to provide preventive
periodic maintenance and repair damage caused by fair wear and tear, but not for accident and
abuse repairs. 2
       1.13.6. (Added) The intended purpose of a government vehicle accident/abuse program
       is to deter the number of vehicle accidents and abuses, protect Air Force people from
       injury or death, and eliminate unnecessary expenditure of limited monetary resources.
       The keys to successfully reduce the number of accidents and abuses are to make base
       personnel aware of the high costs associated with the repair of accident and abuse repairs
       and encourage commanders to maintain high standards of vehicle operator training and
       discipline.
          1.13.6.1. (Added) Funding these avoidable repairs with organizational user's funds
          will ensure that limited maintenance dollars are used to maintain the fleet and
          underscore the need for management involvement in a viable squadron-level accident
2                          AFI24-302_JBLANGLEYEUSTISSUP 12 DECEMBER 2013


       and abuse prevention program. It will also foster an effective operator training
       program, encourage operator care, prevent needless repairs and ultimately save wing
       funds by holding commanders and their assigned vehicle operators accountable for
       their actions.
    1.13.7. (Added) Fair wear and tear: The normal and expected deterioration of a vehicle
    or equipment based on its age, usage, and service life expectancy.
       1.13.7.1. (Added) Vehicle accident: Any situation where a government owned or
       leased vehicle or equipment strikes or is struck by a government owned or leased
       vehicle or equipment, a non-government owned or leased vehicle or equipment and/or
       an object, structure, or animal, which could have been prevented by action on the part
       of any vehicle operator involved.
       1.13.7.2. (Added) Vehicle incident: Any situation where a government owned or
       leased vehicle or equipment sustains damage which could not have been prevented by
       action on the part of any vehicle operator or other responsible party, despite taking all
       reasonable precautions to prevent such damage. Examples of incidents include acts
       of nature, road hazards, etc.
       1.13.7.3. (Added) Vehicle abuse: Any situation where a government owned or
       leased vehicle or equipment sustains or may sustain damage not attributable to fair
       wear and tear, a vehicle accident, or a vehicle incident, which could have been
       prevented by action on the part of any vehicle operator or other responsible party.
       Some examples of vehicle abuse are listed in Attachment 10.
    1.13.8. (Added) The Vehicle Management Flight (633 LRS/LGRV) will implement the
    wing’s vehicle accident and abuse programs and policies. The Commander, 633d
    Logistics Readiness Squadron (633 LRS/CC) will coordinate with affected unit
    commanders on the transfer of O&M funds to cover vehicle accident and abuse repair
    costs.
       1.13.8.1. (Added) All vehicle management O&M funds expended for vehicle
       accident and abuse repair costs, including contract cost, civilian and military labor
       will be reimbursed to vehicle management by the owning organization, or the
       organization responsible for the damage, if not the owner. The using organization
       may not be the owning organization (e.g., U-Drive-It vehicle from Logistics
       Readiness Squadron or a loaned vehicle from another organization). Damage caused
       to U-Drive-It vehicles is the responsibility of the operator’s assigned organization.
       Report U-Drive-It vehicle damage to Vehicle Operations (633 LRS/LGRDO).
       Accident damage discovered on vehicles temporarily reassigned due to a priority
       recall situation will be the responsibility of the organization gaining the vehicle.
       1.13.8.2. (Added) The using organization investigates all damage not attributable to
       fair wear and tear IAW AFI 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property.
       1.13.8.3. (Added) Reimbursement and/or direct payment will be made regardless of
       any administrative or pecuniary liability assessed to an individual. The using
       organization will coordinate reimbursement and direct payments through 633
       LRS/LGRV. This can be accomplished by a straight transfer of funds using an OF
       1017-G, Journal Voucher, direct payment via the Government Purchase Card (GPC),
AFI24-302_JBLANGLEYEUSTISSUP 12 DECEMBER 2013                                               3


        or a Form 9 (Request for Purchase). Units electing to use GPC for transactions under
        $3,000 will coordinate with vehicle management and pay contractor and/or the
        supplier directly. Vehicles will not be released to the user until 633 LRS/LGRV
        receives confirmation that payment was made or the transfer of funds was completed.
        1.13.8.4. (Added) The Vehicle Management Flight Commander, Vehicle Fleet
        Manager (VFM), or Vehicle Management Superintendent (VMS) will provide a
        written analysis of whether the vehicle damage was caused by accident, abuse, or
        incident and forward his or her opinion to633 LRS/CC, who will make the final
        determination on classifying the type of vehicle damage.
        1.13.8.5. (Added) If a government owned or leased vehicle or equipment is involved
        in an accident with a privately owned vehicle (POV) and the POV is the negligent
        party, 633 LRS/LGRV Vehicle Management and Analysis (VM&A) will coordinate
        with 633 ABW/JA to have the liable party’s insurance company make direct payment
        to the repairing contractor.
        1.13.8.6. (Added) If a government owned or leased vehicle or equipment is involved
        in an accident with a POV and the government owned or leased vehicle or equipment
        operator is the negligent party, that individual’s organization is responsible for
        reimbursement of repair costs for the government owned or leased vehicle or
        equipment. 633 ABW/JA will resolve the POV liability issue if a claim is filed.
        1.13.8.7. (Added) Accident/Abuse letters of release will be completed within a 2-
        day period, unless the owning organization, in coordination with VFM/VMS,
        determines more time is needed for investigative purposes. Maintenance repairs will
        commence after the third day of the vehicle being reported to vehicle management.
        Exception: Accidents involving a GOV and a POV or any other non-Air Force owned
        property will not be repaired until authorized by 633 ABW/JA.
        1.13.8.8. (Added) Accidents/Abuses to GSA leased vehicles must be reported to the
        GSA Accident Control Center through 633 LRS/LGRV (VM&A) section. VM&A
        will coordinate with the GSA Accident Center, who in turn will direct them where to
        take the vehicle for repairs. If a vehicle is involved in an accident, a Standard Form
        91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report must be filled out and forwarded to VM&A. All
        damages other than “fair wear and tear” are a “Bill-Back” from GSA to Langley
        AFB. These damages are a “Must-Pay Bill.” All costs incurred by GSA to restore
        the vehicle to its original condition will be borne by the using organization
        responsible for the damage. If responsibility for damages cannot be determined, the
        owning organization will be responsible for payment. The responsible organization
        can pay the vendor with a GPC card or GSA will pay for the accident and 633
        LRS/LGRV will seek reimbursement from the unit.
     1.13.9. (Added) 633 LRS/LGRV will:
        1.13.9.1. (Added) Provide the 633 LRS/CC with accident/abuse notification letter,
        who will in turn notify the owning/using organization commander by letter
        (Attachment 11). The letter may be electronically signed. The letter will contain an
        estimate of the costs to repair the accident or abuse damage through LGRV or
        commercial sources. The bottom portion of the notification letter will include an
4                       AFI24-302_JBLANGLEYEUSTISSUP 12 DECEMBER 2013


    endorsement section for the organizational commander, and once endorsed, serves as
    the release letter back to 633 LRS/LGRV.
    1.13.9.2. (Added) Repair the vehicle upon receipt of the completed bottom portion
    of the Accident/Abuse Notification Letter (Attachment 11) from responsible unit.
    Repairs can commence 2 days after the notification letter is released.
    1.13.9.3. (Added) Perform vehicle repairs using the most economical means. Local
    commercial vendors will be the primary method of repairing GOVs with accident or
    abuse damage. 633 LRS/LGRV will select the source for repair based upon quality,
    timeliness, warranty, reliability, economy, and mission needs.
    1.13.9.4. (Added) Maintain accident/abuse case files for at least 1 year to track
    quantity and repair cost data.
    1.13.9.5. (Added) Provide the AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value
    Statement, when requested by the owning/using organization.
    1.13.9.6. (Added) Track and provide costs to be reimbursed to the 633d Comptroller
    Squadron, Accounting and Finance Flight (633 CPTS/FMA).

    organization.
    1.13.9.8. (Added) Using/Owning organizations will:
    1.13.9.8.1. (Added) Ensure vehicle accident/incident damages are immediately
    reported to Security Forces or civil authorities prior to moving the vehicle. Operators
    must complete Standard Form 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report, at the scene. In
    accidents involving Privately Owned Vehicles (POVs), the operator must complete
    DD Form 518, Accident-Identification Card, at the scene. Report damages within 24
    hours to the Vehicle Management Customer Service Center in Bldg 30 when released
    by authorities.
       1.13.9.8.2. (Added) Ensure a viable vehicle accident prevention program is part
       of the unit’s safety program. Safe driving guidelines for an effective vehicle
       accident prevention program are provided in Attachment 12.
       1.13.9.8.3. (Added) Forward a copy of the Letter of Release/Acceptance of
       Financial Responsibility to 633 LRS/LGRV when vehicle is no longer needed for
       investigation.
       1.13.9.8.4. (Added) Conduct an investigation in accordance with AFI 23-220,
       Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, to determine if gross negligence, willful
       misconduct, or unauthorized use was involved.
       1.13.9.8.5. (Added) Submit an ACC Form 164, Ground Mishap Report, to 1
       FW/SE or 633 ABW/SE, regardless of injury or extent of damage. The operator’s

       personnel assigned to their unit.
AFI24-302_JBLANGLEYEUSTISSUP 12 DECEMBER 2013                                                 5


         1.13.9.9. (Added) 633 CPTS/FMA will:
             1.13.9.9.1. (Added) Approve and forward supporting documentation Journal
             Voucher to DFAS.
         1.13.9.10. (Added) 633 ABW/JA will:
             1.13.9.10.1. (Added) Contact the liable party’s insurance company and arrange
             direct payment to the repairing contractor when the POV operator is the negligent
             party in an accident with a government owned or leased vehicle and equipment.
             If the operator of the POV is uninsured, 633 ABW/JA will pursue reimbursement.
         1.13.9.11. (Added) 633 MSG/CC will:
             1.13.9.11.1. (Added) Resolve all conflicts concerning the vehicle accident and
             abuse program and serve as the final decision authority. If an organizational
             commander believes the government owned vehicle or equipment accident/abuse
             case is not justified, written justification must be forwarded to the 633 LRS/CC.
             If the 633 LRS/CC agrees, the case will be dropped. If not, the case will be
             forwarded to the 633 MSG/CC for final decision. Exception: Open cases
             involving GSA leased vehicles cannot be contested as they are a “Must Pay Bill”
             borne by the using organization.
  11.9.10. (Added) This anti-idling policy limits the amount of time vehicles can idle their
  engines. Exhaust from idling vehicles contains dangerous air pollutants, including carbon
  dioxide, which contributes to global climate change, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic
  compounds, both of which contribute to the formation of ozone smog, poisonous carbon
  monoxide and harmful particulate matter. Idling vehicles also waste fuel and increase wear
  and tear on the vehicle’s engine. JBLE instructions concerning the Vehicle Idling Policy are
  included in paragraphs 11.9.10.1 through paragraphs 11.9.13.3.
         11.9.10.1. (Added) Anti-idling policies are a cost-effective, common sense way to
         reduce air pollution, and they are easy to implement. By reducing the amount of time
         that engines idle, we will use less fuel, save money, and help clean the air.
     11.9.11. (Added) IAW Virginia Administration Code Title 9, 5-40-5670(C) Motor
     Vehicles, idling time limit is 10 minutes for diesel vehicles & tour buses in commercial
     or residential urban areas.
         11.9.12.1. (Added) During extreme cold weather situations associated with Wind
         Chill Index and flag colors “yellow” and “red”, vehicles may remain idling for the
         purposes of warming, when no indoor heated environment is available. The vehicle
         should only remain idling during the hourly warming cycle, IAW AFPAM 48-151,
         Thermal Injury. Safety is the number one concern. It is at the operator’s discretion if
         he/she feels the need to have a vehicle idle longer for the purpose of warming, to
         prevent hypothermia, frostbite, etc.
         11.9.12.2. (Added) During extreme hot weather situations associated with Heat
         Category flag colors “red” and “black”, vehicles may remain idling for the purposes
         of cooling, when no indoor cooling environment is available. The vehicle should
         only remain idling during the hourly rest/cooling cycle, IAW AFPAM 48-151,
         Thermal Injury. Safety is the number one concern. It is at the operator’s discretion if
6                       AFI24-302_JBLANGLEYEUSTISSUP 12 DECEMBER 2013


    he/she feels the need to have a vehicle idle longer for the purpose of cooling, to
    prevent heat exhaustion, etc.
    11.9.13.1. (Added) The idling policy does not apply to the following vehicles,
    equipment or situation. Operators must use their own discretion in certain situations.
       11.9.13.1.1. (Added) Vehicles undergoing maintenance/diagnostic procedures
       and flight line operations such as loading and unloading aircraft.
       11.9.13.1.2. (Added) The purpose of defogging, defrosting or deicing windows.
       Idling must end when fog, frost, or ice conditions have been eliminated.
       11.9.13.1.3. (Added) Emergency vehicles and equipment are exempt while
       engaged in operational activities such as a fire, police or ambulance services or
       vehicles assisting in an emergency activity/military exercise. In addition, Security
       Forces vehicles transporting K-9s are exempt.
       11.9.13.1.4. (Added) Where engine power is necessary for an associated power
       need such as, but not limited to, electrical power, compressed air, and various
       power take off devices such as auxiliary hydraulics/wrecker/deicer operations.
       11.9.13.1.5. (Added) Where safety may be compromised by shutting down the
       engine, at the discretion of the operator.
       11.9.13.1.6. (Added) During passenger loading or unloading of buses.
       11.9.13.1.7. (Added) When in Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) I-
       IV conditions, vehicles may remain idling for air conditioning use to prevent heat
       exhaustion, unless otherwise directed.
    11.9.13.2. (Added) Unless otherwise specified, a “5 minute” idling policy is in
    effect on Joint Base Langley-Eustis, VA.
    11.9.13.3. (Added) Vehicles will not be left idling unattended.
