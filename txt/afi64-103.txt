Supersedes AFI 64-103, 1 May 1997                                                              Pages: 23

This Air Force Instruction (AFI) identifies procedures and responsibilities for leasing U.S. Air Force
non-excess personal property, including aircraft and related equipment, to non-government organizations.
This instruction does not apply to leases of non-appropriated fund personal property or to military leases
of U.S. property to foreign governments or international organizations under Chapter 6 of the Arms
Export Control Act. This AFI applies to all active and reserve components of the United States Air Force
(AF), including Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. This
instruction aligns with AFPD 64-1, The Contracting System, and implements, in part, Title 10 United
States Code (U.S.C.), Section 2667, as amended. It also complements: 1) DoD Financial Management
Regulation 7000.14-R, Vol.11A, “Reimbursable Operations, Policy, and Procedures,” Chapter 4, “User
Charges,” 2) DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Vol. 12, ”Special Accounts, Funds and
Programs,” Chapter 14, “Transferring, Disposing, and Leasing of Personal Property,” and 3) DoD Direc-
tive 7230.8, Leases and Demonstrations of DoD Equipment. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW AFMAN 37-123 (will be AFMAN 33-363),
Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication
to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
The scope of this AFI is expanded to include procedures for leasing not only aircraft and related equip-
ment, but also all types of non-excess personal property. This AFI now clarifies policy regarding charges
to lessees (see paragraph 3.2.) participating in international air shows or conducting demonstration or
evaluation flights for representatives of foreign governments. The scope is also expanded to include new
procedures for the selection of lessees (see paragraph 4.1.), for notification of Congress (see paragraph
2                                                                                                      AFI64-103 6 NOVEMBER 2006


4.2.), and for annual reporting requirements (see paragraph 4.3.) and is applicable to ANG and AFRC
units.

                                               Chapter 1

                                     PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Section 1A—Overview

1.1. Purpose. The AF is authorized to lease equipment to non-Governmental entities (e.g. defense con-
tractors, industry associations) when it has been determined that such equipment is not “excess” property
and can be leased without adversely impacting military readiness. This instruction provides AF proce-
dures for: processing lease requests to obtain necessary approval, structuring lease agreements, and
reporting lease activity.

1.2. Approval Authority. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (SAF/AQ) may autho-
rize lease of non-excess USAF aircraft, aircraft-related equipment and other personal property, when
SAF/AQ considers it advantageous for the United States, under such terms and conditions as SAF/AQ
considers will promote the national defense or be in the public interest. SAF/AQ will indicate approval to
lease non-excess personal property by signing a written Determination and Findings (D&F) prepared for
each lease request as described by this instruction. The D&F documents will conform to the requirements
of law, DoD directives, and this instruction. Authority to waive or deviate from the provisions of this
instruction or to delegate leasing authority rests with SAF/AQ (authority may be exercised by memoran-
dum, D&F or Assistant Secretary of the Air Force Order (ASAFO), as deemed appropriate). Although
SAF/AQ exercises approval authority to lease non-excess personal property, other officials exercise
related approval authority as described in this instruction (e.g. approval to export equipment to foreign
countries is addressed in paragraph 3.10., and approval for direct DoD participation at international air-
shows is addressed in paragraph 3.12.).

1.3. Coordinating Officials. Field activities receiving requests from non-governmental organizations to
lease non-excess USAF aircraft, aircraft-related equipment and other personal property shall review and
evaluate the requests (see paragraph 1.6. and 1.9.) and submit such requests via staff summary sheet to
SAF/AQ through SAF/AQCK for approval. Lease request packages shall include: the written request
from the defense contractor or other non-Government entity (see paragraph 1.13 below for minimum con-
tents), a D&F for SAF/AQ signature (see sample at Attachment 2), the proposed leasing agreement that
includes the elements identified in Attachment 4, and all necessary coordinations as described below. All
lease requests for non-excess USAF aircraft and aircraft-related equipment flow through the cognizant
Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) organization that is responsible for the property to SAF/AQCK.
Lease requests for all other non-excess personal property (other than aircraft and related equipment) are
forwarded by the requesting Major Command (MAJCOM) directly to SAF/AQCK in accordance with
MAJCOM procedures.
    1.3.1. The Office of the Assistant Secretary (Financial Management and Comptroller) (SAF/FMBIS)
    determines the appropriate amount to charge the lessee. SAF/FMBIS provides direct support to con-
    tracting officers contemplating leases.
    1.3.2. Director of Operations and Training, Headquarters US Air Force (AF/XOO) approves lessee
    air show participation plans (see paragraph 3.12.), including demonstration flight profiles in accor-
    dance with AFI 11-209, Air Force Aerial Events.
AFI64-103 6 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                                  5


   1.3.3. Within 90 days after the end of an international trade show or exhibition, the Deputy Under
   Secretary of the Air Force (International Affairs) Action Group (SAF/IAG) provides to Defense Secu-
   rity Cooperation Agency (DSCA), a list of USAF equipment leased for the event. The total cost
   charged to training budgets for transportation of equipment to and from the event is provided to
   DSCA by the appropriate Combatant Command.

Section 1B—Leasing Non-Excess Aircraft and Related Equipment

1.4. Procedures. AFMC establishes procedures and management controls for all leasing of aircraft and
related equipment. All other major commands and the ANG submit lease requests for aircraft and related
equipment to the appropriate AFMC organization for consideration and processing.

1.5. Review. Upon receipt of a request to lease non-excess AF aircraft or related equipment, the cognizant
program office, logistics center, test center, laboratory or other AFMC activity responsible for the aircraft
or related equipment must:
   1.5.1. Evaluate the request and determine if the proposed lease benefits the United States Government
   (U.S. Government);
   1.5.2. Determine that the item requested for lease is not excess to USAF requirements;
   1.5.3. Determine whether the property is available during the proposed lease period;
   1.5.4. Determine if the intended use of the property is appropriate; (See para 1.2. for description of
   appropriate use.)
   1.5.5. Determine whether or not to impose any necessary limitations or reservations on its use;
   1.5.6. Determine whether the proposed lease would pose any technology disclosure issues, and
   whether there are security assistance considerations or any guidance from DOD relevant to the lease;
   and
   1.5.7. As required, evaluate the lessee’s Air Show Participation Plan (see Attachment 3).
   1.5.8. Forward the request package, MAJCOM legal review, D&F, and supporting information
   through SAF/AQCK to SAF/AQ for approval of the lease. SAF/AQCK will ensure SAF/GCQ coordi-
   nation is obtained and other SAF offices as needed (e.g. SAF/GCI, SAF/IAG, etc.).

1.6. Contracting Officer (CO) Responsibilities. The CO representing the cognizant AFMC organization
will:
   1.6.1. Prepare a D&F (see Attachment 2) to lease aircraft and related equipment and forward it with
   the lease request and the supporting information from paragraph 1.6. above to SAF/AQCK for staffing
   and SAF/AQ approval;
   1.6.2. Prepare the lease agreement (see Attachment 4, Required Elements of a Lease Agreement);
   1.6.3. Synopsize the lease requirement, as required, to comply with statutory competition require-
   ments (see paragraph 4.1.1.);
   1.6.4. Assess whether or not the lessee’s proof of insurance (see paragraph 3.4.) meets the require-
   ments of this instruction, or whether it is prudent to permit the lessee to be self-insured;
6                                                                     AFI64-103 6 NOVEMBER 2006


    1.6.5. When applicable, the CO concurrently forwards the prospective lessee's Air Show Participation
    Plan, including demonstration flight profiles, to the Director of Operations and Training, Headquar-
    ters U.S. Air Force (AF/XOO) for staffing and approval. SAF/AQCK can assist the CO in securing
    this approval;
    1.6.6. Assess whether the consideration amount for the lease constitutes fair market value (see para-
    graph 3.2.3.). If consideration represents an amount less than fair market value, ensure the D&F is
    prepared with the appropriate determination (see Attachment 2);
    1.6.7. Execute the lease after SAF/AQ has signed the D&F. Forward a signed copy of all international
    leases for aircraft and related equipment to SAF/IAG; and
    1.6.8. Prepare a Congressional notification and annual reports (as required in accordance with para-
    graph 4.2. and 4.3.).

Section 1C—Leasing Non-Excess Personal Property (Non-Aircraft and Related Equipment)

1.7. Procedures. MAJCOMs establish procedures and management controls for leasing non-excess per-
sonal property (other than aircraft and related equipment). Each MAJCOM will evaluate lease requests
for non-excess personal property as described below.

1.8. Review. Upon receipt of a request to lease non-excess personal property, the cognizant MAJCOM
fielding the request, must:
    1.8.1. Evaluate the request and determine if the proposed lease benefits the United States Government
    (U.S. Government);
    1.8.2. Determine that the item requested for lease is not excess to USAF requirements;
    1.8.3. Determine whether the property is available during the proposed lease period;
    1.8.4. Determine if the intended use of the property is appropriate; (See para 1.2. for description of
    appropriate use.)
    1.8.5. Determine whether or not to impose any necessary limitations or reservations on its use; and
    1.8.6. Determine whether the proposed lease would pose any technology disclosure issues, and
    whether there are security assistance considerations or any guidance from DOD relevant to the lease.
    1.8.7. Forward the request package, MAJCOM legal review, D&F and supporting information
    through SAF/AQCK to SAF/AQ in accordance with local procedures and this AFI for review and
    approval of the lease. SAF/AQCK will ensure proper SAF offices coordinate (e.g. SAF/IAG, SAF/
    GCQ, SAF/GCI, and when personal property is related to real property in any way such as, “fixtures,”
    SAF/GCN).

1.9. CO Responsibilities. The CO will:
    1.9.1. Prepare a D&F (see Attachment 2) and forward it with the lease request and supporting infor-
    mation to SAF/AQCK for staffing and SAF/AQ approval;
    1.9.2. Prepare the lease agreement (see Attachment 4, Required Elements of a Lease Agreement);
AFI64-103 6 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                               7


   1.9.3. Synopsize the lease requirement, as required, to comply with statutory competition require-
   ments (see paragraph 4.1.1.);
   1.9.4. Assess whether or not the lessee’s proof of insurance (see paragraph 3.4.) meets the require-
   ments of this instruction, or whether it is prudent to permit the lessee to be self-insured;
   1.9.5. Assess whether the consideration amount for the lease constitutes fair market value (see para-
   graph 3.2.3.). If consideration represents an amount less than fair market value, ensure the D&F is
   prepared with the appropriate determination (see Attachment 2);
   1.9.6. Execute the lease after SAF/AQ has signed the D&F; and
   1.9.7. Prepare a Congressional notification and annual reports (as required in accordance with para-
   graph 4.1.2 and 4.2.).

Section 1D—Air National Guard Process for Lease of Non-Excess Personal Property

1.10. Overview. The ANG will follow the procedures in Section 1B above for lease requests of aircraft
and related equipment. ANG lease requests for non-excess property under their control (other than aircraft

                                               Chapter 2

                                            LIMITATIONS

2.1. Foreign Governments. This instruction does not apply to military leases of U.S. property to foreign
governments or international organizations under Chapter 6 of the Arms Export Control Act.

2.2. Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB). This instruction may be used in conjunction with the
provision of MRTFB test and evaluation assets to commercial customers under the authority of Title 10
U.S.C., Section 2681, Use of Test and Evaluation Installations by Commercial Entities.

2.3. USAF Assets. The AF may only lease out property that is under its control and is available on a non-
interference basis with U.S. Government requirements.

2.4. Commercial-Like Assets. The AF does not typically lease out property that is otherwise available
from commercial sources.

2.5. Excess Property. Title 10 U.S.C., Section 2667 prohibits the AF from leasing out property which is
excess to AF requirements as defined by Section 102 of Title 40 U.S.C., except as otherwise may be pro-
vided in subsection 2667(f).

2.6. Leasing to Government Organizations and Contractors. Leasing under this instruction may not be
used to provide AF personal property to other government organizations for any purpose (except, see
paragraph 3.2.7.), or to provide AF personal property to contractors for the primary purpose of supporting
U.S. Government contract requirements.

2.7. Duration of Lease. The lease may not be for more than five years, unless SAF/AQ determines that a
lease for a longer period will promote the national defense or be in the public interest.
10                                                                      AFI64-103 6 NOVEMBER 2006


                                                 Chapter 3

                            FEATURES OF THE LEASE AGREEMNENT

3.1. Authorized Uses. The lease agreement specifies how the leased property may be used. The lease
identifies the locations of lease performance.

3.2. Lease Charges. The lessee normally pays the full cost of the lease. Charges include rent, reimburse-
ment for any expense incurred by the U.S. Government in support of the lease and other costs agreed to
under the terms of the lease. Title 10 U.S.C., Section 2667 requires payment (in cash or in kind) by the les-
see of consideration in an amount that is not less than the fair market value of the lease interest. The only
exception to this requirement is limited to real and personal property located at military installations to be
closed or realigned under a base closure law, as provided in subsection 2667(f).
     3.2.1. Rent, including charges for depreciation and interest on investment, is payment in cash or in
     kind by the lessee in an amount not less than the fair market value of the lease interest. The CO deter-
     mines whether to assess rental charges on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis.
     3.2.2. The CO should assess flying-hour charges for a leased aircraft to include, among other things,
     fuel, maintenance, and base support, depending on the leasing situation. Do not assess these charges
     to the extent they are otherwise provided by the lessee. A lessee who is authorized under the lease to
     obtain spare parts from the supply system must pay the appropriate flying-hour charges or the cost of
     the parts.
     3.2.3. Rental charges are set in accordance with DoD Financial Management Regulation DoD
     7000.14-R, Vol.11A, “Reimbursable Operations, Policy, and Procedures,” Chapter 4, “User Charges.”
     SAF/FMBIS sets rental charges for aircraft and other lease property covered by this instruction. SAF/
     FMC sets flying-hour charges. When actual costs are not known, reasonable estimates may be used.
     The CO should solicit direct support from SAF/FMBIS on these charges. When the specific item to be
     leased is identified, these charges may be based on supplemental information obtained from the pro-
     gram office. This information includes the property's:
        3.2.3.1. Acquisition Cost.
        3.2.3.2. Replacement cost.
        3.2.3.3. Age.
        3.2.3.4. Cost of major modifications.
        3.2.3.5. Salvage value.
     3.2.4. Assess rent for equipment leases or for items of equipment the lessee needs to support the
     major items of leased property. For equipment items, the CO may use the clause in the Federal Acqui-
     sition Regulation (FAR) 52.245-9, “Use & Charges.”
     3.2.5. The cognizant Contract Administration Office (CAO) ensures that the lessee reimburses the
     U.S. Government in accordance with the terms and conditions of the lease for the cost of any support
     the lessee receives, including, but not limited to, aircrew pay, travel, and per diem, support aircraft,
     equipment, and facilities to the extent not recovered through assessment of flying-hour charges.
AFI64-103 6 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                                11


   3.2.6. Consistent with DoD Directive 7230.8, Leases and Demonstrations of DoD Equipment, in
   order to promote the national defense or serve the public interest, SAF/AQ may waive cash rental
   charges for leased equipment in support of air shows or trades exhibitions held outside the United
   States; or sales demonstrations to representatives of foreign governments. This waiver authority only
   applies to cash rental charges for the leased property. Regardless of whether or not a cash rental fee is
   charged, charges for any and all expenses related to the support provided a lessee by the U.S. Govern-
   ment are not waived and must be reimbursed by the lessee. For leases of equipment to contractors or
   associations for display or demonstration at international air shows or trade exhibitions, the lessee
   must agree to reimburse the Treasury of the United States for the costs set forth below in subpara-
   graphs 3.2.6.1. through 3.2.6.3. Consideration consisting of reimbursement of all U.S. Government
   costs--whether or not a cash rental fee is charge--and the national defense or public interest to be
   served in these cases generally can support a D&F of not less than fair market value of the lease inter-
   est.
       3.2.6.1. Costs of military personnel accompanying the equipment (e.g. food, lodging, local trans-
       portation);
       3.2.6.2. Transportation costs incurred in moving such equipment from its normally assigned loca-
       tion to and from the event; and
       3.2.6.3. Any other miscellaneous costs that would have been incurred had the equipment not been
       leased. Transportation of equipment to and from an event that fulfills legitimate training require-
       ments that would otherwise have to be met does not constitute a cost that must be reimbursed.
   3.2.7. Property leases supporting the AF and National Guard Community Relations programs may be
   approved and executed on a no-cash rental basis when:
       3.2.7.1. The recipient of the benefits as listed in DODI 5410.19, Public Affairs Community Rela-
       tions Policy Implementation, or in the case of the National Guard those recipients authorized by
       law, are engaged in nonprofit activity designed for the public safety, health, or welfare;
       3.2.7.2. Payment of the full fee by a state, local government, or nonprofit group would not be in
       the interest of the program; and
       3.2.7.3. A local AF official or National Guard United States Property & Fiscal Official makes a
       written determination that the training value, goodwill and/or other national defense or public
       interest associated with support of the Community Relations program constitutes in-kind consid-
       eration that is not less than the fair market value of the lease interest.

3.3. No Cost to the U.S. Government. The lessee must pay all rent, costs, and charges relating to the
leased property during the lease. Because AF property generally may not be provided to contractors for
the primary purpose of supporting U.S. Government contract requirements, the lessee shall not include
any charges or costs resulting from the lease, directly or indirectly, in any U.S. Government contract or
subcontract. Exceptions include:
   3.3.1. Contracts for foreign military sales;
   3.3.2. Independent research and development costs;
   3.3.3. Costs associated with international air shows;
12                                                                      AFI64-103 6 NOVEMBER 2006


     3.3.4. Other limited cases where specific U.S. Government contracts or programs benefit from the
     lease activities; or
     3.3.5. When otherwise authorized by law.

3.4. Risk of Loss. The lessee must agree to assume the risk of loss, damage, or destruction of the leased
property during the period of the lease. The lessee must obtain insurance to cover the depreciated value of
the leased property or, with the prior written approval of the CO, the lessee may be self-insured. When
negotiating a lease, the CO may consider a provision requiring the lessee to replace the leased property in
kind should it be destroyed while the lessee is liable. There are limited situations where a USAF pilot may
be authorized to operate a leased aircraft as pilot-in-command. For example, when no lessee pilot is qual-
ified or available to fly a particular flight profile. In these limited situations the U.S. Government may, if
authorized by SAF/AQ, agree to assume risk of loss of the leased aircraft as an exception to the policy that
the lessee assumes this risk. For aircraft leases, the AF shall review and approve the flight or operation
plan to ensure that the risks are not inordinate to the need (see paragraph 3.12.).

3.5. Indemnification of the U.S. Government. The lessee must agree to hold harmless and indemnify the
U.S. Government, its agents, employees, and officers from any and all loss and liability arising from the
lease. The lessee must obtain insurance to cover all these liabilities.

3.6. Maintenance. The lessee must maintain the leased property during the lease period according to stan-
dards established by the U.S. Air Force or pay the cost of maintenance if the U.S. Government agrees to
perform the maintenance.

3.7. Inspection Responsibilities. The CO must ensure that:
     3.7.1. Contract administration personnel or others are adequately instructed to conduct appropriate
     oversight during lease performance, as required; and
     3.7.2. The activity receiving the property after completion of the lease adequately inspects it to see
     that the lessee maintained the leased property according to USAF standards.

3.8. U.S. Government Support. Any support that the U.S. Government gives to the lessee must not inter-
fere with other Government operations and must be fully reimbursed. This paragraph applies but is not
limited to materials, facilities, transportation, support aircraft, aircrew, and ground support personnel.

3.9. Termination of the Lease. The US Government may terminate the lease at any time and at no cost to
itself. The lessee may terminate the lease after notifying the CO upon 15 days’ written notice. In either
case, the lessee will still have residual responsibilities under the lease (payment of charges, return of the
leased property, etc.). Upon termination of the lease, the property must be returned to the U.S. Govern-
ment. If the property is not returned to the U.S. Government as agreed upon by the terms of the lease, the
CO must request, in writing, return of the property. A notice of interest should be included in the demand
letter. Charging of interest is mandatory under Title 31, U.S.C. and Title 4, Code of Federal Regulations.
The interest on the property is calculated on a “daily rate” basis from the date of the first unsuccessful
request for the return of the property. The CO must consult with local finance office for the actual rate of
interest. In long-term leases, the CO may include a provision in the lease allowing for return of the prop-
erty whenever the U.S. Government has a requirement for it.
AFI64-103 6 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                                13


3.10. State Department Export License Approval. When a lessee wants to demonstrate the leased prop-
erty to representatives of foreign governments or international organizations or to participate in interna-
tional air shows, the lessee must present the CO with evidence of valid export license clearance from the
State Department or other responsible U.S. Government agency. Normally, lessee personnel conduct these
demonstrations.

3.11. Flights for Dignitaries - Orientation Flights. The lessee must get prior approval for orientation
flights for foreign nationals or for dignitaries, including members of the Congress and representatives of
the U.S. news media according to AFI 11-401, Aviation Management (and AFMC Supplement 1 to AFI
11-401). This requirement applies regardless of which MAJCOM provides the leased aircraft or the loca-
tion of the flights. In such cases, the lessee shall submit its request to the CO and the CO will coordinate
with AFMC/DOO to obtain the required approval.
   3.11.1. The following U.S. Government or foreign government equivalent medical evaluation and
   training documentation is required for those receiving orientation flights:
       3.11.1.1. Current flight physical with medical clearance to fly;
       3.11.1.2. Current physiological and altitude chamber training when required by AFI 11-401; and
       3.11.1.3. Life support, egress and/or ejection seat training.
   3.11.2. Requests for approval of an orientation flight when a non-qualified pilot is to occupy a man-
   datory pilot position or perform takeoffs and landings from any position in fighter to trainer aircraft,
   shall include:
       3.11.2.1. Adequate justification;
       3.11.2.2. Details of the training program to be used;
       3.11.2.3. Identification of individuals; and
       3.11.2.4. Type of aircraft in which each individual maintains currency and date of last flight, total
       flight hours in current aircraft, and total flight hours.

3.12. Air Show Participation Plan. Leases that authorize aerial demonstrations at an air show must
require the lessee to obtain prior AF/XOO approval of air show participation plans (see Attachment 3,
Air Show Participation Plan Clause, for required items). The leasing office should identify the US Gov-
ernment contract monitor, brief the monitor on approvals granted the lessee and any limitations that may
have been imposed for a particular air show, and provide copies of pertinent documents. In accordance
with DoDD 7230.8, direct DoD participation in international airshows and trade exhibitions is only autho-
rized if a determination is made by the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy (USD(P)) that such partici-
pation is in the national security interests of the United States.

3.13. Administering Leases. After negotiation, the CO delegates the lease to the cognizant contract
administration office (CAO) for administration. The CAO ensures that the lessee complies with all the
terms and conditions of the lease. It ensures that all lessee flight crewmembers are qualified and maintain
currency and proficiency according to Air Force Joint Instruction 10-220, Contractor Flight and Ground
Operations. In addition, the lessee must:
   3.13.1. Obtain necessary approvals;
14                                                                      AFI64-103 6 NOVEMBER 2006


     3.13.2. Follow maintenance requirements;
     3.13.3. Keep records of property use as a basis for rental charges;
     3.13.4. Pay rental and other charges according to the lease agreement; and
     3.13.5. Return the leased property as directed by the CO.

3.14. Lessee Payments.
     3.14.1. Payments. The CO shall instruct the lessee and appropriate Defense Finance and Accounting
     Service (DFAS) Office on handling lessee money payments. The payment office will deposit lease
     payments to a special Treasury receipt account.
     3.14.2. Reimbursements. The payment office credits payments for flying-hour charges and reim-
     bursements received for support or services provided by the U.S. Government, to the appropriations
     of the activities to which the leased property is assigned or which provided the support or service. The
     payment office will reimburse the supply system with lessee payments for items obtained from the
     supply system.
     3.14.3. In-Kind Rental. The lessee shall make in-kind rental payments in accordance with the terms
     of the lease and instructions from the CO.

                                                 Chapter 4

                            APPROVAL AND REPORTING PROCESSES

4.1. Selection of Certain Lessees. If a proposed lease involves only personal property, the lease term will
exceed one year, and the fair market value of the lease interest is expected to exceed $100,000, then com-
petitive procedures must be used to select the lessee.
   4.1.1. Notice. If the criteria in paragraph 4.1. are met, the CO shall publish a notice on the Internet at
   http://www.fedbizopps.gov describing the USAF’s intent to lease certain property to certain parties
   for a specific period of time. The CO shall use FAR Part 5.2, as a guide. This notice affords other
   potential lessees the opportunity to propose alternative lease projects. The CO will consider all
   responses to the notice. The CO will:
       4.1.1.1. Retain copies of all responses to the notice, prepare a summary of all comments and or
       proposals, and determine whether the initial lease request and/or alternate proposal(s) should be
       processed for approval; and
       4.1.1.2. Include the notice and summary of responses in any lease request package forwarded to
       SAF/AQCK. When proposed leases involve flyable aircraft and related equipment, AFMC will
       forward the package for approval through SAF/AQCK to SAF/AQ.

4.2. Congressional Notification. In the case where all or part of the consideration proposed to be accepted
for a lease is in-kind consideration with a value in excess of $500,000, the Air Force may not enter into
the lease until 30 days after the date on which a report of the facts of the lease is submitted to the Congres-
sional Defense Committees. Also, not later than 45 days before entering into any lease meeting the criteria
in paragraph 4.1., SAF/LLP and SAF/FML shall submit to Congress a written notification prepared by the
CO describing the terms of the proposed lease and the competitive procedures used to select the lessee.
The notification will be submitted to SAF/LLP and SAF/FML, through SAF/AQCK. A copy of the Con-
gressional notification for leases to be approved by SAF/AQ will be included in the D&F approval pack-
age submitted to SAF/AQCK.

4.3. Annual Reports. Activities which have entered into or amended leases during the fiscal year shall
report (through SAF/AQCK to SAF/AQ) within 60 days of the end of the fiscal year an accounting of the
receipt and use of all money rentals that were deposited and expended pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2667, and a
detailed explanation of each lease entered into and of each amendment made to existing leases during the
preceding fiscal year. Reporting of in-kind rental payments and reimbursements for items including but
not limited to support, spares, flying-hour charges is not required. Reporting process shall follow proce-
dures set forth in DoD Financial Management Regulation, 7000.14R, Vol. 12, “Special Accounts, Funds
and Programs,” Chapter 14, “Transferring, Disposing and Leasing of Real Property and Personal Prop-
erty” (Aug 2002).

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS
Authority to Lease United States Government Property
Pursuant to Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C), Section 2667 and the authority delegated to me by the
Secretary of the Air Force, I have reviewed the request to have the Department of the Air Force lease
_________________________ (specify property) to ________________________ (name of non-Gov-
ernment entity) from the period _________ to ________ (term of lease) for the purpose of
_________________________ (i.e. describe the lessees intended use specifying whether the equipment
will be used in static or aerial). I have found that the property to be leased is in fact not excess . Air Force
property and the proposed lease agreement includes the elements required by Air Force Instruction (AFI)
64-103 Leasing Non-Excess USAF Aircraft, Aircraft-Related Equipment and Other Personal Property to
Non-Government Organizations.
       Pursuant to Title 10, U.S.C., Section 2667, I hereby determine that the property to be leased is
under the control of the Department of the Air Force; is not excess property as defined by Title 40, U.S.C.,
Section 102; and that the cash rent and other consideration has been determined to be not less than the fair
market value of the lease interest. Therefore, I consider the above-described lease of such property to be
advantageous to the United States and such terms to be in the public interest.
[If the proposed lease entails consideration in an amount less than fair market value, replace the second
paragraph with the following: I have found that the consideration for this lease has been determined to be
less than the fair market value of the lease interest; however, it has been determined that (insert the basis
for the exception to the statutory requirement for receipt of consideration in an amount not less than the
fair market value of the lease interest). Pursuant to Title 10, U.S.C., Section 2667, I hereby determine that
the property to be leased is under the control of the Department of the Air Force and is not excess property
as defined by Title 40, U.S.C., Section 102. Therefore, I consider the above-described lease of such prop-
erty to be advantageous to the United States and such terms to be in the public interest.]
The Director for Contracting, (name of the organization), or designed contracting officer, is authorized to
execute a lease according to this Determination and shall conform to the findings specified above.

Officer, the approval of the Director of Operations and Training (HQ USAF/XOO) for an Air Show Par-
ticipation Plan covering the following:
               (1) Detailed schedule of planned use of the leased aircraft;
                (2) The names and qualifications of the pilots who are scheduled to fly the aircraft in prac-
tice, deployment or redeployment, and air show flights. This includes any civilian visitor anticipated to be
at the controls of the aircraft during orientation flights;
               (3) Specific information on the qualifications of other crewmembers who may be needed;
             (4) The names, qualifications, and exact duties of contractor supervisors who may in any
way manage and control the U.S. Air Force aircraft while it is leased;
               (5) The intended flight profiles planned for:
                   (i) Favorable weather conditions (specify favorable weather conditions for subject
aircraft);
                    (ii) Weather conditions less than favorable but above the air show minimums, USAF
flight rules, and the aircraft handbook (technical order) limitations; include request for waiver of aircraft
weather minimums, if applicable; and
                   (iii) Alternate modified profiles for both weather conditions that would be flown if air
show authorities limit flight time due to scheduling problems.
               (6) Provisions for ensuring adequate preflight rest for the pilot (or pilots) and other crew-
members. This discussion must include how the flight crews (pilots) will be isolated from potential mar-
keting or other possible pressures that may be expected;
                (7) Specific schedule and attendees at preflight planning, preflight briefings, and post
flight debriefings;
               (8) Means of providing a visual record of all practice flights and air show demonstrations;

for maneuvers (such as anti-G suit);
               (11) Specifics on each nonstandard configuration of the leased aircraft; and
                (12) A list of each item of equipment or stores the Lessee intends to incorporate in or use
to support the leased aircraft, other than U.S. Air Force standard equipment or approved stores list;
       b. Lessee's initial proposal and any revised proposals for such Air Show Participation Plan shall be
submitted to the Contracting Officer.

        c. The Lessee shall comply with the provisions of the approved Air Show Participation Plan for all
air show demonstrations, exhibition, and evaluation flights performed with the leased property during the
term of this lease at, or in the general vicinity of, the air show and for all practice and pilot qualification
flights performed during the term of this lease in preparation for such demonstration, exhibition, or eval-
uation.
        d. The Lessee shall permit the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) or a dele-
gate, as appointed by the U.S. Government for this lease, to monitor air show participation under this
lease. The COTR must have access to the leased aircraft and maintenance and staging areas during the
entire period of air show participation and during all periods of practice or qualification for air show par-
ticipation as authorized under this lease.
        e. The COTR shall be considered an element of U.S. Air Force support, whose costs are charged
to the Lessee as lease support costs.
         f. The Lessee shall submit to the Contracting Officer, within 30 days after the completion of the air
show, a lease completion report explaining any problems encountered in aircraft practice and participation
flights and recommending changes in procedures to improve the safety of U.S. Air Force aircraft leased
for air show participation in the future. The Lessee shall also, at the written request of the Contracting
Officer and at no cost to the U.S. Government under this lease, provide to the U.S. Government two cop-
ies of all visual records and flight recorder data of all practice flights and air show demonstrations as
called for above.
        g. The Lessee shall advise the Contracting Officer if it plans to participate in static displays or
flights demonstrations at the air show. The COTR will designate a time and place for Lessee personnel to
receive a cautionary briefing on the military security requirements and other sensitive areas related to the
leased aircraft and equipment.
         h. It is mutually understood and agreed that the sole purpose of this clause is to give the U.S. Gov-
ernment full knowledge of the intended use of the leased property and an opportunity to observe the Les-
see's compliance with its proposed plan. The Lessee acknowledges and agrees that the U.S. Government
makes no warranty that the approved plan is safe and that the U.S. Government assumes no risk of loss or
liability to third parties that may arise even if the Lessee adheres to the approved plan. This clause creates
no exceptions to the Lessee's obligations to assume risk of loss and third party liability, including obtain-
ing insurance, as set out fully in the clauses elsewhere in this lease.

equipment to the lessee and back from the lessee and whether the lease will begin and end with the trans-
fer of possession of the leased equipment, or whether it will begin at another specified time.

leased property while it is under lease according to applicable Department of Defense and Department of
the Air Force directives and instructions and this Determination and Finding. No daily rental charge will

eral Acquisition Regulations. Costs charged to the U.S. Government for the leased property under such
contracts will not exceed the lessee's costs under the lease. The U.S. Government reserves the right to

rectly to the U.S. Government based on this lease.
22                                                                         AFI64-103 6 NOVEMBER 2006


12. The lessee shall assume the risk of loss, damage, or destruction of the leased property. The lessee’s
risk must be covered by insurance or, with the Contracting Officer’s prior written approval, a plan for
self-insurance on the depreciated value of the property. (Unless the undersigned determines that the U.S.
Government agrees to assume this risk (e.g. when a U.S. Air Force pilot is the pilot-in-command of the
leased aircraft)
13. The lessee shall release the Department of the Air Force, including a release from all consequential
damages, and defend, indemnify, and hold the U.S. Government, its agents, officers, and employees
harmless from any and all loss and liability (whether in tort or contract) that might arise in connection
with the lease because of: (a) injury or death of personnel of the U.S. Government, the lessee, or third par-
ties; and (b) damage to or destruction of property of the lessee or third parties, and leased property, sup-

the lease
15. The lessee shall return all leased property to the Department of the Air Force, at such place as is des-
ignated by the Contracting Officer, in the same condition and configuration as when accepted, except for
fair wear and tear. If the Department of the Air Force determines that any of the leased property was not
returned in such condition, or has not been maintained according to prescribed Department of the Air
Force standards, the lessee shall reimburse the Department of the Air Force for the cost of returning such
property to its proper condition, except for fair wear and tear.
16. The Department of the Air Force may revoke this lease at any time. The lessee may terminate the lease
at any time upon 15 days' prior written notice. If the lease is revoked by the Department of the Air Force
or terminated by the lessee, the lessee shall be responsible for its residual responsibilities under the lease
(to return leased property, to pay all charges or costs resulting from the lease, to release, defend, indem-
nify, and hold harmless the U.S. Government, etc.).
17. The lessee shall assume any responsibility imposed by other U.S. Government agencies, or by foreign
governments and their taxing authorities, for certification and registration of the leased property and for
payment of any taxes or other charges thereon.

resentative determines that the lessee has implemented procedures to ensure safe and proper storage,
maintenance, and operation of the leased property.

see and shall ensure, if applicable, all lessee flight crewmembers are qualified and maintain currency and
proficiency according to Air Force Joint Instruction 10-220, Contractor Flight and Ground Operations.
In addition, the lessee shall ensure that no civilian visitor is at the controls of the aircraft during any orien-
tation flight, unless specifically approved by the Department of the Air Force.
20. During the term of the lease, the lease status of the leased property may be interrupted from time to
time by the Department of the Air Force to make the property available for other U.S. Government activ-
ities under U.S. Government contracts with the lessee. During such periods, the property reverts to Gov-
ernment-Furnished Property status under the applicable U.S. Government contract. Any doubt as to the
AFI64-103 6 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                                   23


status of the leased property at any particular time will be resolved in favor of lease status, unless other-
wise determined by the Department of the Air Force.
21. The lessee shall secure from the Department of State or other responsible U.S. Government agency
any export licenses or other approvals required under the Arms Export Control Act or other U.S. law or
regulations before using the leased property in connection with the provision of articles or services to a
foreign government or other foreign person.
22. The lessee shall obtain approval in accordance with DoD Directive 7230.8, before any demonstration,
orientation, or evaluation flights for representatives of foreign governments. (applies only in leases of air-
craft contemplating this possibility.)

according to AF Instruction 11-401, Aviation Management. (applies only in leases of aircraft contemplat-
ing this possibility.)

for approval by the Department of the Air Force. The plan shall cover all information listed in the Air
Show Participation Plan Clause. Department of the Air Force approval of, or involvement in, such a plan
shall not diminish the lessee's assumption of risk of loss and liability in connection with the lease. (applies
in all leases contemplating air show flights of leased aircraft.)
25. The lease will require the lessee to obtain Air Force approval for each project utilizing the leased air-
craft even if the individual projects are within the scope of intended use as described in the lease (used
rarely, but may be used if desired to maintain strict control over use of leased aircraft)
26. The lessee will not use any government equipment contrary to international law including the law of
armed conflict, domestic law, or Department of Defense and Air Force policies relating to, or more
restrictive than, international law and the law of armed conflict. Furthermore, the lessee will not use any
government equipment in inherently military activities such as combat or combat support. This clause
does not prohibit the inherent right of self-defense.
