1. Overview of the Air Force Special Access Administrative Process. When normal security
methods cannot protect an activity from a known threat, special access controls safeguard
operational and technological advantages from potential enemies by limiting access to
information about, or observation of, certain weapons, weapon systems, techniques, and
operations. DoD, SAF, HQ USAF, and many commands, agencies, and program offices work
together in SAPs to create, maintain, modify, and terminate special access controls. The
Secretary of the Air Force and Deputy Secretary of Defense set formal SAP policy. A SAP’s
dynamic oversight feature must be at least equal to normal security programs; justify the need for
special access controls by constantly monitoring the specific threat(s) to the program; and require
individuals to follow tailored security and operating procedures, public laws, and national
policies.
1. (AFOTEC)General Information. The AFOTEC mission requires command insight and
involvement in all areas for SAPs, ranging from DoD SAPs sponsored by individual services to
those processes managed at Joint Staff and Air Staff levels to enhance warfighting capability. To
streamline internal and external communications and ensure maximum efficiency, the oversight
of these areas is the responsibility of a single organization, AFOTEC/A-3Z. AFOTEC/A-3Z
 4                                          AFI16-701_AFOTECSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2011


reports directly to AFOTEC/A-3, while interacting with all directorates in AFOTEC and
supporting subordinate AFOTEC units.
     1.1. (Added-AFOTEC) AFOTEC/A-3Z will serve as OPR for all SAP issues. As OPR,
     AFOTEC/A-3Z will function as AFOTEC’s SAP Central Office (SAPCO) to provide policy,
     oversight, and guidance for SAP management.
2. Program Oversight. For security reasons, few people have blanket access to SAPs. Among
those authorized personnel are members of the Special Access Required (SAR) Programs
Oversight Committee (SPOC), the Special Access Program Review Group (SPRG), and selected
members of Congress and the Department of Defense as approved by the DepSecDef. The
SECAF chaired SPOC ensures SAP status is justified and that SAPs conform to standards and
policy. It reviews program elements, security, and audits of all Air Force SAPs and eliminates
duplicate efforts by SAPs and other programs. The SPRG, on the other hand, acts as the Air
Force OPR for programmatic and resource review of Special Access Programs.
3. Special Access Programs Categories. For the purpose of sending annual budget reports to
Congress, DoD 5205.7 categorizes Special Access Programs as Acquisition (AQ-SAP),
Operations & Support (OS-SAP) or Intelligence (IN-SAP).
     3.1. AQ-SAP activities are reported to OUSD(A&T)/DSP (AQ-SAP Central Office) because
     they receive RDT&E, procurement funds, or both.
     3.2. OS-SAP activities are reported to DUSD(P)/PS (OS-SAP Central Office) because they
     do not receive RDT&E or procurement funds, but do protect sensitive operations.
     3.3. IN-SAP activities are reported to ASD(C3I)/ODASD(I&S) (IN-SAP Central Office)
     because they are intelligence funded.
4. Acquisition Planning. Managers of SAPs impacted by DoD acquisition directives (5000.x
series) must consider guidelines specifically tailored to SAPs.
     4.1. Contracting in Special Access Programs. SAPs conform to contracting regulations,
     including the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS),
     and Air Force FAR Supplement (AFFARS). These regulations reflect the laws, Executive
     Orders, and OSD policy applying to all DoD acquisitions except those specifically exempted.
     In addition, major command regulation supplements and other regulations further guide
     contracting offices. Clearly, SAP acquisition offices may not be able to conform to some
     regulations without compromising national security or violating security restrictions. Some
     regulations already provide sufficient exceptions for national security or classified
     information. Other deviations may require case-by-case waivers.
        4.1.1. SAF/AQCF is the Air Force focal point for FAR, DFARS, and AFFARS
        deviations. SAP acquisition offices submit deviation requests to the SAF/AQC
        contracting staff officer located in SAF/AQL for staffing and approval. Deviation
        requests must be formatted IAW DFARS 201.402 and AFFARS 5301.402.
     4.2. Designating Carve-Out Contracts. "Carve-out contracting" removes a program from
     the security oversight of the Defense Investigative Service’s Defense Industrial Security
     Program. The DoD Information Security Regulation (DoD 5200.1R) authorizes carve-out
     contracting only for SAPs that meet exceptionally stringent security criteria. Chapter XII of
     DoD 5200.1R describes the criteria for carve-out status. Only the Secretary or Deputy
AFI16-701_AFOTECSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2011                                                           5


   Secretary of Defense can approve carve-out contracting. Program managers will request
   carve-out contracting with the request for SAP approval to the Deputy Secretary of Defense
   and revalidate carve-out procedures annually.
       4.2.1. Using the DD Form 254, DoD Contract Security Classification
       Specification. Activities sponsoring a SAP with contractor support use DD Form 254,
       classified if necessary, when creating a carve-out from DIS. DD Forms 254 must include
       requirements for contractor(s) to identify specific program locations (such as a safes,
       rooms, buildings, plants, etc.) which are a "carve-out" to the program’s CSA. Send a
       copy of each DD Form 254 to the proper DIS security office, except when a SAP needs
       extra protection. In this case, forward DD Form 254 to SAF/AAZ, who notifies DUSD(P)
       or DIS.
5. Relationships Among Special Access Security Controls, Procedures, Activities,
Programs, and Other Security Systems. Executive Order 12356, National Security
Information, as implemented by Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) Directive No 1;
DoD 5200.1R/AFPD 31-4/AFI 31-401; and DoDD O-5205.7, implements special access
controls. These controls provide extraordinary protection by: keeping personnel access to the
minimum needed to meet program goals; setting investigative or adjudicative criteria for persons
seeking access; naming officials who determine whether cleared people have a need-to-know;
using access lists and registered unclassified nicknames (and, in some cases, classified code
words) to identify information needing additional protection; security guides and procedures
specifically tailored for certain information and equipment; and supporting and overseeing
infrastructures. Security controls protect a given activity. A special access program is the
protected activity. The Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense formally approves, in writing,
these legally defined programs and annually reports on them to Congress. Each Air Force SAP
and each SAP the AF operates for other agencies or activities must be formally registered with
SAF/AAZ, the Air Force SAP Central Office (SAPCO). SAPs containing Sensitive
Compartmented Information (SCI) or Single Integrated Operational Plan-Extremely Sensitive
Information (SIOP-ESI) may have other security control systems, such as SCI and SIOP-ESI.
For example, SAPs must obtain approval to introduce the SAP into a Sensitive Compartmented
Information Facility (SCIF) from HQ 497 IG/INS and also negotiate a security agreement with
HQ 497 IG/INS. Since SAPs in SCIFs are usually a tenant, SCI directives govern SCI protection.
These additional security control systems apply only to that specific compartmented information.
The term SAP, often substituted for "Special Access Required (SAR)", may describe the security
control system, the entire effort, and in some cases certain budget information.
6. The SAP Administration System Concept. Senior management uses the SAP to increase
the security of information about an activity. Only "core secrets" have special access controls; in
an unacknowledged program, its very existence is a core secret and all information relating to the
program may be protected with special access controls. Normal security controls, classification,
and handling systems protect other information. Examples of activities protected with special
access controls might include a technology breakthrough or exploitation of an enemy’s
weakness. A SAP could also fix a US weakness or protect extremely sensitive operations.
   6.1. SAP Initiation and Approval Procedures. An Air Force office wanting to establish a
   SAP sends a recommendation through command channels to the HQ USAF or SAF office
   responsible for the activity. At a minimum, the request must contain the information in
   Attachment 2 and the approval memoranda (Attachment 3) for the Secretary of the Air
6                                           AFI16-701_AFOTECSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2011


    Force to sign. Mark all documentation with the proposed special access classification
    markings (see 6.1.1 paragraph.) or other information to reflect minimum access required.
    Coordinate the request with the responsible DCS, ACS, or Secretariat office and include at
    least: HQ USAF/PE, to evaluate funding and manpower need; SAF/ AA, to review security
    plans; SAF/GC, to review legal issues; SAF/FM, to review funding; and HQ USAF/IN, to
    review programs with SCI material or needing the intelligence community to participate and
    to approve the overall threat assessment (see 6.1.1 paragraph.). Then send request through
    HQ USAF/CC and SAF/US to SAF/OS for the final decision before forwarding it to OSD.
    The responsible Air Staff office will prepare proposed approval memoranda for Secretary of
    the Air Force signature. SAF/AAZ routes the approval packages through the appropriate
    OSD Central Office to the Deputy Secretary of Defense.
       6.1.1. A thorough, current threat assessment constitutes the basis for applying and
       maintaining special access controls to a program. In the absence of a threat, special
       access controls are inappropriate. Likewise, changing threats may deem special access
       controls no longer necessary. Threat assessments must consider both the system threat
       and the intelligence threat. System threats prepared by USAF/IN generally apply to AQ-
       SAPs and describe the threat to be countered by the weapon system. The focus of the
       system threat is to identify current and projected capabilities that an adversary could use
       to defeat, destroy, degrade, or deny the effectiveness of a proposed concept or system.
       The intelligence threat, on the other hand, is normally assessed by AFOSI and describes
       the susceptibility that program information will be compromised through foreign
       intelligence activities. These activities include Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery
       Intelligence (IMINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Measurement and Signatures
       Intelligence (MASINT), and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).
       6.1.2. Prospective Special Access Programs (PSAP). During the SAP approval
       process, you may protect information with Prospective Special Access Programs (PSAP)
       procedures. SAF/ AAZ gives PSAP status in a formal memorandum sent to the program
       office. Unless the PSAP gains formal SAP status, or the protected program ends or is
       reclassified, the PSAP automatically ends after 180 days. A PSAP’s only purpose is to
       protect information until the SAP staffing is completed.
    6.2. Air Force Participation in a Program Directed by Another DoD Component or
    Another Agency. Any request for Air Force participation in or support of another DoD
    Component or Agency’s SAP must be made through SAF/AAZ. At a minimum, the request
    must contain a proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or Memorandum of
    Agreement (MOA) and the information described in Attachment 4. SAF/AAZ will ensure
    the responsible Air Force office reviews the recommendation and coordinates it with the
    responsible DCS, ACS, or Secretariat office, as well as SAF/ OS, SAF/US, HQ USAF/CC,
    USAF/CV, SAF/GC, SAF/AA, SAF/FM and HQ USAF/PE (for SAPs proposing to use Air
    Force funds or manpower), and HQ USAF/IN (for all programs with SCI material or having
    intelligence community participation). SAF/FM will also coordinate on those programs
    where Air Force funding is not involved but other component/agency funding flows through
    Air Force mechanisms. If the agreement originates outside DoD, the Air Force must notify
    the Deputy Secretary of Defense.
    6.3. Changes in SAP Controls. SAP managers notify Congress before they make
    significant changes in SAPs, such as termination, discarding controls, regrading to collateral,
AFI16-701_AFOTECSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2011                                                              7


   and public announcement. Program managers prepare notification packages in advance and
   forward them through SAF/AAZ to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Contact SAF/AAZ for
   additional information.
7. SAP Access. DoD and other Executive Agency and legislative members or employees may
require SAP access to meet their support or oversight responsibilities. Some may need only
administrative information (such as printing plant personnel and administrative staff) while
others (such as the Air Force SPOC and the Joint Staff’s Joint Requirements Oversight
Committee (JROC)) may need detailed briefings to fully understand the impact of their actions
on a SAP. People outside the Air Force (i.e., DoD/IG, other services, etc.) normally send a
Program Access Request (PAR) memo to the SAPCO (SAF/AAZ), who forwards it to the
program manager to determine the need-to-know and access level. Attachment 5 describes the
specific policies and procedures for granting SAP access to legislative members and employees.
Certain organizations, such as the JROC, have established billet structures (as found in JSI
5220.02) to identify personnel needing access because they routinely work SAP issues. Such
billet structures are not blanket access approvals nor do they give all persons in the billets access
to any or all SAPs. Access is given on a case-by-case, need-to-know basis.
   7.1. Ensuring Personnel Security for Access to SAPs. The minimum security clearance
   level for access to SAP information is a Secret clearance based on a National Agency Check
   with Credit Check (NACC). The NACC must be no more than five years old. Access control
   procedures are strictly followed and to gain access, personnel must accept, in writing,
   specific restrictions and liability for unauthorized disclosure. Additionally, personnel may
   undergo separate access adjudication procedures beyond basic security clearance. Persons
   requiring access to one or more SAPs may be subject to periodic counterintelligence scope
   polygraph examinations, within the limits set by Congress or the Office of the Secretary of
   Defense. Commanders and supervisors continually evaluate all personnel with access to SAP
   information. Follow the continuing evaluation requirements found in AFI 31-501 and in SAP
   Security/Classification Guides.
       7.1.1. Special Handling Procedures. SAP materials require enhanced security
       measures by all persons generating or handling such materials. To ensure proper handling
       of these types of materials, the procedures and practices listed in Attachment 6 apply to
       all SAPs.
   7.2. Administrative Recourse. The Air Force follows DoD policies for administrative
   recourse for all SAP personnel security and access decisions. If reports on a candidate are
   unfavorable, a central adjudication office sends a letter to the applicant’s security staff stating
   access is denied, suspended, or limited. A properly marked, sealed letter for unopened
   delivery to the candidate is included. When consistent with national security, the letter
   explains the action; gives the candidate 30 days to request information about the action; and
   states that the candidate may submit clarifying, rebutting, mitigating, or explanatory
   information. If, after reviewing the new information, the judgment remains unfavorable, the
   candidate receives notification and an explanation of other appeal procedures.

            program and gives specific classification and regrading guidance. It also explains
            how to report fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) without violating security agreements
            and procedures. Each person participating in the program is taught to report FWA
            properly.

10. Reporting Requirements. SAF/AAZ compiles and submits annual SAP reports (DoD
Report Control Symbol: DD-C3I(A)1605) to OSD Central Offices, which send them to
Congress. Annual SAP reports serve as the vehicle for annual DEPSECDEF revalidation and
SAP approval. By 1 December of each year, program managers send SAF/AAZ a report in the
format given in Attachment 8. Program managers also send SAF/AAZ by 31 December of each
year a separate security report (SAP Summary) per DoD 5200.1R and the instructions given in
Attachment 9. SAF/AAZ compiles these reports and sends them to DUSD(P). Program
managers also report program nicknames to SAF/AAZ whenever they change.
11. Handling Program Artifacts. The program manager must properly screen classified or
sensitive unclassified objects such as test equipment, test fixtures, prototype systems, models,
and associated technical information and files for intrinsic or historical value. Actions the
program manager considers include reviewing the objects" classification, destroying it, giving it
to the contractor or other DoD organizations to keep or destroy, and sending it to a museum or a
secure storage site.

   sensitive unclassified SAP artifacts. Contact SAF/AAZ before disposal.
12. (Added-AFOTEC) Program Accessing Requirements and Procedures:
   12.1. (Added-AFOTEC) Access to SAP information is neither a right nor an entitlement; it
   is a wholly discretionary security determination granted only to those individuals who meet
   stringent background and security standards. Personnel will not be granted access based
   solely on federal service, contracting status, a matter of right or privilege, or as a result of any
   particular title, rank, position, or affiliation.
   12.2. (Added-AFOTEC) Individuals requiring access must have a valid need-to-know and
   materially or directly contribute to the program.
   12.3. (Added-AFOTEC) At a minimum, individuals requesting SAP access must be US
   citizens and hold a minimum of a current National Agency Check with Local Agency and
   Credit Check for access to SECRET SAPs. TOP SECRET SAPs require a current Single
   Scope Background Investigation (SSBI). Clearance investigations must be current within 5
   years.    Also, certain SAPs require individuals to maintain eligibility for Special
   Compartmental Information access. If the person’s periodic reinvestigation is outside the 5-
   year scope and all other access processing is current and valid, the SAPCO may authorize
14                                       AFI16-701_AFOTECSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2011


  access. However, the individual will be immediately processed for a SSBI and submit a
  Letter of Compelling Need (LOCN). The LOCN requires a detailed justification (specific to
  the individual) and the following questions must be addressed:

                                         Attachment 5
      POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ON ACCESS TO SAP INFORMATION FOR
                EMPLOYEES OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

A5.1. Purpose. This attachment amplifies the DoD policy on access to information protected
with Air Force or joint SAPs for employees of the Legislative Branch and details procedures on
how access to program information may be requested.
A5.2. Scope. These policies and procedures for Air Force SAPs apply to Legislative Branch
and the General Accounting Office (GAO) employees. These procedures do not apply to SAPs
initiated under the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) or other Executive
Branch departments and agencies.
A5.3. Air Force Policy:
   A5.3.1. Only permanent professional staffs of congressional defense committees and
   selected intelligence committees, and employees of the GAO who have a minimum of a
   SECRET clearance and a need-to-know gain access to Air Force SAPs, while serving in an
   official capacity for the following:
       A5.3.1.1. DoD authorization or appropriation legislation.
       A5.3.1.2. DoD oversight or investigative activities directed by law or formal committee
       action.
       A5.3.1.3. Other legislative matters requiring SAP access as determined by the Secretary
       or the Deputy Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the Air Force
   A5.3.2. The term "defense committees" means the Senate Committee on Armed Services,
   the House of Representatives National Security Committee, and the Defense and National
   Security Subcommittees of the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of
   Representatives. For Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA) SAPs, the term
   also includes the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select
   Committee on Intelligence.
   A5.3.3. Access to Air Force SAPs will not be granted to any employee of the Legislative
   Branch serving in the capacity of personal staff to a member of Congress.
   A5.3.4. Where possible, the Air Force meets congressional needs for information on SAPs
   with non-compartmented material. The Air Force gives direct access to compartmented
   material only when noncompartmented material does not meet congressional need.
   A5.3.5. Compartmented access will last only long enough to fulfill the information
   requirement and only to approved individuals while serving in a capacity requiring such
   access.
   A5.3.6. The Legislative Branch may not keep material DoD protects with compartmented
   security controls unless the DUSD(P) approves it in advance and the Air Force primary
   office sponsoring the SAP determines that the retention facilities meet all prescribed security
   standards for the classification level and any special handling requirements for the materials
   involved.
AFI16-701_AFOTECSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2011                                                    33


   A5.3.7. The Department of Defense, DCI, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Office of
   Personnel Management (OPM), or other investigative agencies approved by DoD investigate
   the backgrounds of employees seeking access to compartmented information. The results of
   the background investigation (BI) must meet the DoD standards for the SAP.
A5.4. SAP Procedures:
   A5.4.1. A request for access to Air Force SAP compartmented information must be
   submitted with the approval of the chair or ranking minority member of a committee or
   subcommittee with defense oversight. In extremely urgent cases, the Air Force accepts the
   staff member’s signature. The request must include:
      A5.4.1.1. Name of individual requiring access.
      A5.4.1.2. Social Security number.
      A5.4.1.3. Date of most recent BI and name of investigating agency.
      A5.4.1.4. Committee or subcommittee capacity in which access is required.
      A5.4.1.5. Purpose and duration of required access.
      A5.4.1.6. Identification of information required.
   A5.4.2. SAP managers process requests for access by:
      A5.4.2.1. Submitting them to SAF/AAZ for approval, who coordinates with the
      responsible OSD office as needed.
      A5.4.2.2. Verifying an individual’s security clearance before identifying and providing
      access to compartmented information.
      A5.4.2.3. Referring disputes to the DEPSECDEF when Air Force and congressional staff
      are unable to resolve access issues.
   A5.4.3. Promptly notifying SAF/AAZ when individuals granted access no longer require
   access or are departing the local area so a debriefing can be completed.

A6.1. The following handling procedures apply to all SAP materials.
   A6.1.1. Materials hand-carried from one office to another will be enclosed within a locked
   security pouch or briefcase.
   A6.1.2. Exposed wrapping/packaging material will not display any classified information,
   i.e., outer cover sheets/wrapings may have unclassified nicknames but will not have
   codewords. Outer cover sheets/wrappings will have special handling instructions, such as
   SPECIAL HANDLING OF THIS DOCUMENT IS REQUIRED. HAND
   CARRY DURING ROUTING. NORMAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS
   WILL NOT BE USED. ACCESS TO THIS DOCUMENT MUST BE
   LIMITED ONLY TO THOSE WITH A STRICT NEED TO KNOW.
   CONTACT THE PROGRAM OFFICE FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.
   A6.1.3. Wrappings and/or cover sheets will have specific program point of contact
   (POC)/alternate and telephone number for material retrieval. In the event the program POC
   cannot retrieve SAP or sensitive materials, instructions will be provided to the recipient to
   contact a specifically cleared individual for pickup.
   A6.1.4. Clearances and access for an individual will be verified prior to leaving material
   with that individual.
   A6.1.5. Only in rare or unusual instances will executive officers, military assistants, or office
   administration personnel be granted access to SAP information, and then only if there is a
   bonafide need-to-know. Convenience or efficiency are not legitimate need-to-know criteria.
   A6.1.6. Materials will be stored only in program approved storage facilities and security
   containers. Individuals transporting such materials will ensure recipients understand any
   specific handling and storage requirements.

                        SAP SUMMARY REPORT INSTRUCTIONS

A9.1. SAP Summary Reports are required for all Air Force Special Access Programs established
by the Secretaries of Defense and the Air Force. They are designed to solicit information from all
program offices to comply with established DoD and Air Force requirements. The formal report
for the annual summary to DEPSECDEF has two sections. Section 1 solicits headquarters
program managers to provide general program information; section 2 focuses on carve-out
contracts that may require information from the contractor and/or the system program office
(SPO). SAF/AAZ will task appropriate offices 60 days before required due dates and include the
prescribed format to be used. Submit one consolidated Program Summary to SAF/AAZ. Follow
the program security guide to determine the overall classification of each report. While specific
format and data requirements will be provided in formal tasking, the following guidelines are
provided to assist in preparing the main report.
   A9.1.1. Section 1 provides basic security and administrative information about the program.
   It’s important to identify all subprograms and projects within the SAP. If any of them
   changed names, give the old and new names. Assess the importance of arms control
   agreements, changes in threat, and actions taken to protect your information. Attach a metric
   assessing the program’s technological or operational advantage against an adversary or threat
   (AFPD 16-7).
   A9.1.2. Section 2 addresses carve-out contracts. Each program with one or more associated
   carve-out contracts must include all subcontractor carve-outs and a complete copy of
   section 2 for each carve-out contract. A carve-out contract awards a classified contract to an
   industrial firm but relieves the Defense Investigative Service of security inspection
   responsibility. This distinction is particularly important since the Secretary must specifically
   identify to DEPSECDEF and request approval to continue all carve outs in the annual report.
       A9.1.2.1. If inspectors do not use a DD Form 696 (Industrial Inspection Report), clearly
       identify the type of inspection format used.
       A9.1.2.2. DD Forms 254 (Contract Security Classification Specification) will be made
       available upon request.
