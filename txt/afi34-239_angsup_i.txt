                           FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

1.1. Unauthorized Uses. Do not use appropriated fund (APF) food from food service for social activi-
ties.
1.1. (ANG) Unauthorized Uses. Under no circumstances will appropriated subsistence funds be used to
support activities outside of normal authorized meals. Subsistence forecasting is coordinated through the
base comptroller. Units are authorized one meal per eight-hour period. If units require additional meals, it
is the Installation Commander’s prerogative. Identify any subsistence funding shortfalls through the Wing
FINPLAN. Unauthorized activities include but are not limited to family days, air shows, commander’s
calls, change of commands, “awards,” “promotions” or retirement functions. For additional information
see, Attachment 9, Eligible Customers and What They are charged in ANG APF Food Service Facilities.
   1.1.1. Organizational Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funds (3400) may not be used to provide
   free beverages to military or civilian employees. With exception of those members who are on Essen-
   tial Station Messing (ESM), formerly known as Subsistence in Kind (SIK) and meet the requirements
   of being exposed to the elements for extended periods, have no reasonable access to refreshment
   sources, and where beverages are required to remain alert. For example, Security Force personnel who
   are ESM and manning gates and guard posts. Civil Engineering personnel who are ESM involved in
   snow removal or work locations where no reasonable access to refreshment sources to remain alert
   would be authorized. These individuals would be authorized mission essential beverages provided at
   Government Expense using the 3500 Appropriation for ESM. All other personnel, military or civil-
   ians, would be required to pay for coffee or other beverages that are provided from the Air Force Din-
   ing Facility.
   1.1.2. Sports Beverages (Gatorade) used as Mission Essential Beverages will not be purchased with
   3500 Appropriation for ESM. Sports beverages will be purchased using Organizational O&M funds.
   Organizations must comply with AFMOA/CC Memo dated 3 Jul 01. AF 3500 ESM funds will not be
   used to purchase sports beverages. Sports beverages must be purchased with unit/operation/mainte-
   nance 3400 funds. Must have medical commander approval. AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and
   Procedures, paragraph 4.45.6 Sports Beverages.

1.2. Nutrition Education. Refer to AFI 40-104, Nutrition Education, for specific information on meet-
ing recommended nutritional standards.

1.3. Menu Patterns. The food service officer (FSO) makes sure the menu patterns in the Worldwide
Menu are used.
1.3. (ANG) Menu Pattern. The Services Commander ensures menus are developed for each FY. The
ANG Services (NGB/A1S) web page provides a menu template based on the Air Force’s 14-day standard
menu. The menu will include the minimum standards of 2 meat entrees, 2 starches, 2 vegetables, gravy,
soup, salad, dessert, 2% milk, coffee, tea and soda. Units may also provide low-calorie and/or vegetarian
entrees based on customer needs. Authorized holiday meals are posted on the Air Force Services
Agency’s (AFSVA) web site and celebrated during the Unit Training Assembly (UTA) weekend of the
holiday month. The kitchen superintendent has the authority to alter/deviate from the standard Air Force
menu as long as cost structure and accountability are maintained.

1.4. What People Do? Refer to Attachment 2.
1.4. (ANG) What People Do. NGB/A1S has the same duties and responsibilities as a MAJCOM. The
Mission Support Group Commander will appoint a responsible individual for units without a Services
Officer assigned.
    1.4.1. (Added-ANG) Services Commanders are responsible for having a current food service contin-
    gency plan.

1.5. Use of Air Force APF Dining Facilities. Refer to Attachment 3.

1.6. Types of Flight Meals and Allowances. Refer to Attachment 4.
1.6. (ANG) Types of Flight Meals and Allowances. Any flight meals prepared in an ANG regular din-
ing facility must meet Air Force standards for flight meals.

1.7. Customer Feedback. Use AF Form 27, Food Service Customer Survey base or major command
(MAJCOM) approved form to get feedback from customers in all APF dining facilities.

1.8. A La Carte System (ALACS). A system in which the dining facility charges the Basic Allowance
for Subsistence (BAS) guest and other cash guests for each menu item selected. ESM guests are furnished
their meals without charge. This is the only authorized feeding system for Air Force food service opera-
tions.
1.9. (Added-ANG) Food Service Evaluation. All ANG units will use NGB 1038, Food Service Evalu-
ation Record, semi-annually to evaluate their food service operation. NGB 1038 Guidelines are in

                                               Chapter 3

                            MANUAL FOOD SERVICE ACCOUNTING

3.1. Accounting for Cash and Forms. FSOs and food service managers fully and accurately account for
the meals they serve.
    3.1.1. FSOs
       3.1.1.1. Safeguard AF Form 79, Head Count Record.
       3.1.1.1. (ANG) Safeguard AF 79, Head Count Record. AF 79, Head Count Record, is replacing
       AF 79, Cash Collection Record, AF 1339, Dining Hall Signature Record, AF 463, Request for
       Flight Meals, and AF 2039, Ground Support Meal Request. Use AF 79 to collect signatures for
       customers eating in the ANG dining facility and ground support feeding. ANG food service oper-
       ations will not integrate the forms during production times. Units will use a separate AF 79 for
       SIK customers and Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) customers.
          3.1.1.1.1. (Added-ANG) Each signature on the AF 79 must include the last four-digits of the
          Social Security Number (SSN) (required for SIK).
          3.1.1.1.2. (Added-ANG) NGB/A1S approves Meal Electronic Identification Scanning
          (MEIS). Use this program to generate automated AF 79s or other formats to document cus-
          tomer meals.
          3.1.1.1.3. (Added-ANG) Services Commanders will assign control numbers for SIK and
          BAS accountability for AF 1254, Register for Cash Collection Sheets, based on local auditing
          requirements. Example; 123BAS001 to 123BAS100 or 123SIK001 to 123SIK100.
       3.1.1.2. Verify the daily amount of cash collected and turn in to the accounting and finance office.
          3.1.1.2.1. (Added-ANG) Submit the DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, to the finance
          office on the day requested by FM. For exercises requiring continuous feeding operations
          greater than two days, submit the DD Form 1131 daily. For control and information purposes,
          enter the consolidation of cash overages or shortages in the lower part of the “detailed descrip-
          tion of purpose for which collections were received” column. Then total all amounts at the bot-
          tom of DD Form 1131. For units who purchase money orders, deduct the cost of the money
          order from the cash receipts and identify as a line item (i.e. - $1.50 Money Order) on the DD
          Form 1131. NOTE: local financial managers do not require original or copies of the AF 79.
          Accounting and Finance is required to issue a voucher number on the DD Form 1131, which
          in turn is posted on the AF 1254.
       3.1.1.3. Investigate if safeguarded forms are missing.
       3.1.1.4. Account for signature records on AF Form 1254, Register for Cash Collection Sheets.
       3.1.1.5. For all type of meals, prepare the AF Form 1119-1, Manual Monthly Monetary Report
       (RCS: HAF-SVS(M) 9122). Refer to Attachment 5.
       3.1.1.5. (ANG) ANG food service is not authorized cross-service billing for one or two members
       of another military service, but can for large groups of marines, army, navy etc. Cross billing is
       authorized for groups that do not use our subsistence monies.
AFI34-239_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                         9


       3.1.1.6. Use AF Form 282, Unannounced Spot-Check of Cashier, each month to spot check
       each cashier function for accurate customer count and cash control procedures.

3.2. Food Service Managers:
   3.2.1. Account for forms and cash issued to cashiers on AF Form 1305, Receipt for Transfer of
   Cash and Vouchers.
   3.2.2. Report any cash overages or shortages on DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher.

   3.2.5. Record all instructions to the cooks about what food to prepare, how much to make, and when
   to prepare meals on the Production Log.
   3.2.6. (Added-ANG) AF 1119, Monthly Monetary Records, must be completed and sent electroni-
   cally to NGB/A1S monthly. Send AF 1119 on the last day of the month or on the last day of feeding
   operations as applicable. When meals are contracted/catered, the AF 1119 is still required to ensure
   block 8 (closing inventory) and block 13 (cumulative gain/loss) are carried over to the next month. If
   contracted, provide the number of contract meals served in block 18 (remarks).

3.3. Gains and Losses. The food manager must try to keep each food account within three percent of the
monthly-earned income. If a manager records greater losses for three consecutive months, the following
action is taken:
3.3. (ANG) Gains and Losses. ANG tolerances are based on the number of days of operations on the
reporting month. For UTA or any other one or two-day lunch feeding operations, ANG units are autho-
rized 10% gain or loss on the AF 1119. For Annual Training (AT) periods or feeding operations of three
days up to 17 days, the unit is authorized 5% gain or loss on the AF 1119. If feeding operations exceed 17
days, units are required to maintain a 3% gain or loss on the AF 1119. AF 1119 is due to NGB/A1S on the
last day of feeding operations each month. Units providing more than one continuous operation within a
given month must meet the lowest tolerance authorized, i.e., one UTA feeding and one 15-day AT feeding
allows 5% tolerance for the month even if the 15 days carry over to the next month.
   3.3.1. The Services Squadron Commander or Division Chief investigates the account and takes
   appropriate action to include a report of survey on DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation
   of Property Loss. The commander or division chief informs the Mission Support Group Commander
   with a summary of the deficiencies and the corrective action taken to bring the food account back
   within authorized tolerances.
   3.3.1. (ANG) The Services Commander will investigate and take appropriate action if the Food Ser-
   vice operation is out of tolerance (gain or loss) for three consecutive months. Provide a Memorandum
   for Record (MFR) to NGB/A1S identifying why the food service operation was out of tolerance. The
   MFR should accompany the AF 1119 when sent to NGB/A1S on the last day of feeding operations
   each month.
   3.3.2. The Mission Support Group Commander informs the MAJCOM Director of Services (SV) of
   the actions taken to fix the problem.
10                                                              AFI34-239_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


     3.3.2. (ANG) If the Food Service operations are out of tolerance (gain or loss) for four consecutive
     months, the Mission Support Group Commander will investigate and take appropriate action, to
     include an MFR to the Chief of Services, ANG, (NGB/A1S) identifying why the food service opera-
     tion cannot meet authorized tolerances and the corrective action taken.

3.4. Small and Large Flight Meals. When FSOs and managers use a dining facility or flight kitchen to
prepare meals that will be served away from the dining facility, the food cost for these meals must not
exceed 30 percent of the meal cost allowance for a small meal and 65 percent of the meal cost allowance
for a large meal. Request meals on AF Form 79.

3.5. Field Feeding. Use a meal cost allowance determined quarterly by HQ AFSVA/SVOHF for field
feeding.
3.5. (ANG) Field Feeding. Use the ANG field feeding meal allowance when utilizing unique B-rations
or Unitized Group Rations (UGRs).
     3.5.1. Keep a weekly record of all types of meals served and a weekly monetary accounting on the AF
     Form 1119-1, Manual Monthly Monetary Report. For reporting procedures, refer to Attachment 5.
     3.5.2. All accounting will be done on a weekly basis. Take a weekly physical inventory to determine
     the food expenses. Conduct monthly inventories in accordance with paragraph 5.4.
     3.5.3. For base exercises or short-term contingencies; the food manager must try to keep the food ser-
     vice account three percent of the total earned income for the exercise. For field operations, which
     extend over a one-month period or consecutive months, the food manager must try to keep the food
     service account within three percent of the monthly-earned income. If a manager records greater
     losses for the timeline listed above:
        3.5.3.1. The Services Squadron Commander or Division Chief investigates the account, takes
        appropriate action, to include a report of survey on DD Form 200. The commander or division
        chief informs the Mission Support Group Commander with a summary of the deficiencies and the
        corrective action taken to bring the food account back within authorized tolerances.
        3.5.3.2. The Mission Support Group Commander informs the MAJCOM SV of the actions taken
        to fix the problem.
     3.5.4. Each base food service activity conducting field feeding will carry forward gains/losses each
     month throughout the fiscal year.
     3.5.5. For menu patterns, all field feeding operations must comply with the Air Force feeding plan as
     defined in United States Air Force War and Mobilization Plan, Vol 1 (WMP-1, Annex GG).
     3.5.6. (Added-ANG) AF 1650b, Field Feeding Summary, and AF 1119-1, Manual Monthly Mone-
     tary Record, are required for field operations exceeding 48 hours. Transfer all food items in/out of the
     dining facility using AF 3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer Receipt. This allows removal of food
     from one inventory and placement into another (other appropriated fund activities only). It is also used
     to send food outside of food service (such as to a field exercise) or return food to the food service sys-
     tem. Use AF 3516 to remove food from the subsistence account when it is determined to be unfit for
     human consumption. The FSO designates in writing, by name and duty title, the persons responsible
     for the security of food in each facility.
AFI34-239_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                         11


3.6. (Added-ANG) The Food Cost Index (FCI). NGB/A1S will provide an annual ANG-specific FCI
for ANG dining facilities and field feeding operations prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.
3.7. (Added-ANG) Ground Support Meals. Mission Support Group Commanders must ensure meals
served away from the dining facility are kept to a minimum. Unit level supervisors are responsible for
ensuring personnel obtain a meal in the dining facility during meal hours. Meal, Ready to Eat (MREs) are
accounted for on “AF Form 1119-1”. Ensure the DoD food inspection stamp is on the back of all copies
of AF Form 3516 and keep a signed copy of AF Form 3516 on file for audit and inspection purposes.
Ensure the oldest rations on hand are used or rotated first. Operational rations stored by the unit must be
re-inspected by local Military Public Health inspection personnel in accordance with DSCP Handbook
4155.2, at least 180 days before the inspection Test Date (ITD) stamped on each case or placard. NOTE:
expected shelf life is 3 years unrefrigerated; however, shelf life may be extended or shortened by certifi-
cation from Military Public Health inspection personnel per applicable directives. MREs or UGRs are
recommended as a substitute for ground support meals for at least one meal per day during training exer-
cises, inspections or base alerts.
   3.7.1. (Added-ANG) ANG Food Service Operations are authorized to purchase MREs and Tailored
   Operational Training Meal’s (TOTM) from Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP). For addi-
   tional information pertaining to the TOTM, see the DSCP Webpage: http://www.dscp.dla.mil/subs/
   oprat.htm.
       3.7.1.1. (Added-ANG) Issuing Meals-Ready-to-Eat (MRE) From Food Service. Whe n Se r -
       vices issues MREs to units and the unit controls the issue of MREs and the collection of monies,
       the following applies:
           3.7.1.1.1. (Added-ANG) The base FSO transfer the MREs to the requesting organization on
           DD form 1297.
           3.7.1.1.2. (Added-ANG) The FSO provides the using organization with AF Forms 79 and
           current meal rates. The FSO advises the organization that the rations are accountable. When
           the exercise is concluded, all rations not documented as issued or sold on AF Form 79 must be
           immediately returned to food service, with the turn-in of cash collected on AF Form 79.
           3.7.1.1.3. (Added-ANG) Once all meals, forms and cash have been received, complete AF
           Form 1119-1 to account for the meals used during the exercise.
   3.7.2. (Added-ANG) When members are on RUTA/SUTA status and the dining facility is closed,
   recommend MRE’s/TOTM or frozen meals. Another option is the meal chits program coordinated
   through the Contracting Office to obtain a Vendor to provide meals based on the annual DoD rates.
   Any other packaged meal must be approved by NGB/A1S before purchase.

use contract/catered meals once per quarter to allow Services units to conduct home station training. Sub-
sistence forecasting must be coordinated with the finance office Wing FINPLAN. Co-located units should
coordinate with their host Services unit to forecast Subsistence funding by May 1st for the following fiscal
year.
3.12. (Added-ANG) BAS Entitlement at Reserve Training Sites (RTS).
DoD policy is that all military members, both officer and enlisted, on any type of active duty, at a Reserve
Training Site under Temporary Field Assignment, receiving no per diem, will receive full BAS. Food ser-
vice personnel will collect cash, at the Discounted Meal Rate (DMR), for each meal consumed at the RTS
on stationary days. On travel days, if a member is in a group travel status (members traveling together in
a government owned or procured vehicle), they will be charged the Discounted Meal Rate, if members are
traveling in any other status and receiving full per diem, they will be charged the Standard Meal Rate for
any meals consumed at the Reserve Training Site. For guidance, see DODFMR Vol 7A Chapter 25, para-

   4.2.4. Keep a daily accounting of all food costs and meals served in all types of dining facilities on the
   Sales and Cost Report. Refer to Attachment 5 for reporting procedures.
   4.2.5. Record all instructions to the cooks about what food to prepare, how much to make, and when
   to prepare meals on the Production Log.
   4.2.6. Record raw and finished waste on the Waste Log.

4.3. Theoretical Cost Percentages. Food service managers in automated operations are responsible for
ensuring the theoretical cost percentage, from the Sales and Cost Report, average between 75 percent
and 85 percent with 80 percent being the target.

4.4. Gains and Losses. The food manager must try to keep each food account within three percent of the
total sales. If a manager records greater losses for 3 consecutive months:
   4.4.1. The Services Squadron Commander or Division Chief investigates the account, takes appropri-
   ate action, to include a report of survey on DD Form 200. The commander or division chief informs
   the Mission Support Group Commander with a summary of the deficiencies and the corrective action

                                                Chapter 5

                               FOOD ORDERING AND INVENTORY

5.1. Forecasting. The FSO gives the Defense Supply Center - Philadelphia (DSCP) account manager the
forecast for food requirements 60 days in advance for Continental United States (CONUS) locations and
120 days for overseas (OCONUS) locations. The Prime Vendor (PV) forecast allows contracts to be tai-
lored to the customer’s requirements and allows the customer maximum flexibility.

5.2. Ordering. For manual operations, the storeroom clerk uses E-mail to order food. Use DeCA Form
70-20, Subsistence Request for Issue, Turn-in, or Transfer, when purchasing from the Defense Com-
missary Agency (DeCA) resale store. In automated operations, the storeroom clerk will input commissary
purchases in Aloha’s inventory control. In automated dining facilities under PV, the user orders directly
from the PV through an electronic catalog in Aloha’s inventory control that lists all the items available for
the customer to order. Catalog updates, requisitions, purchase orders, acknowledgments, and receipts are
transmitted electronically using a closed loop Electronic Commerce system between the customer, the
DSCP, and the contractor.
   5.2.1. (Added-ANG) All ANG units will use STORES web, Prime Vendor Program. ANG food ser-
   vice operations will use DSCP as their primary subsistence source. Subsistence Government Purchase
   Card (GPC) purchases are only for emergency purposes, when the normal subsistence provider cannot
   supply a needed item.

5.3. Reconciliation. The storeroom manager will turn in all paperwork to the accountant within 24 hours
of receipt of food items. The accountant will:
   5.3.1. Record all types of purchases on the SF 1080, Voucher for Transfer Between Appropriation
   and/or Funds.
   5.3.2. In automated operations, verify correct amounts on the Purchase (History) Journal and the
   Receipt Confirmation. If you do not receive receipt confirmation within 2 business days, contact
   STORES helpdesk for further assistance.
   5.3.3. Correct any discrepancies using Inventory Control or STORES Web, as applicable. Refer to
   the CFS Handbook.
   5.3.4. Coordinate discrepancies with the DSCP account manager.

5.4. Inventory Control. To make sure food is controlled from the time of receipt until it's served, store-
room clerks:
   5.4.1. Keep high dollar storage areas secured.
   5.4.2. Record all food transferred between facilities, on AF Form 3516, Food Service Inventory
   Transfer Receipt at non-automated operations. For automated operations, a transfer-in will be an
   Invoice Entry and a transfer-out will be an Adjustment Entry. Use the CFS Handbook to manage
   transfers between food service operations.

5.5. Physical Inventory. The storeroom clerk will conduct a weekly inventory as defined by CFS. The
FSO assigns a member other than the storeroom clerk to take a physical inventory of all food items at the
close of business on the last day of the month.
5.5. (ANG) Physical Inventory. The Services Commander assigns a member, other than storeroom per-
sonnel, to physically inventory all food items at the close of business on the last day of UTA or the last
day of the month for continuous operations. Inventory levels for storerooms will not exceed $3K unless
approved by the FSO. The FSO or Services Commander reviews and certifies the inventory.
     5.5.1. The person taking the inventory:
        5.5.1.1. In manual operations, record the inventory count on AF Form 3514, Inventory Count
        Worksheet. In automated operations, record the count on the Count Sheets. Enter counts in the
        Physical Count Entry under Inventory Control.
     5.5.2. The FSO reviews and certifies the inventory.

5.6. End of Fiscal Year (FY) Inventory.
     5.6.1. On the last day of the current fiscal year, the FSO assigns someone outside of food service to
     conduct the physical inventory using the following procedures:
        5.6.1.1. The Food Service Manager will provide the inventory officer with the count sheet printed
        from CFS (Physical Count Entry).
     5.6.2. The inventory officer will count all items in all storage locations, kitchen, and production areas
     assisted by storeroom personnel.
        5.6.2.1. Once the inventory officer completes the counts, storeroom personnel will enter the
        counts into CFS (Physical Count Entry). The inventory officer will verify all counts are entered
        into CFS. Storeroom personnel will save the inventory and reconcile the overages and shortages.
        Once complete, the storeroom clerk will print the Edit List Count Sheet. The inventory officer
        will sign the Edit List Count Sheet, certifying the inventory is correct. The Food Service Manager
        will also sign the Edit List Count Sheet.
     5.6.3. Once inventory is complete save the inventory and close out.
        5.6.3.1. The following day, the manager will process the physical counts. After processing phys-
        ical counts, verify all counts were processed (look in Physical Counts and the Event Viewer).
     5.6.4. Once this process is completed food service manager will print out 3 copies of the On Hand
     Summary Report (RCS: HAF-SVO(A)0304)—this is your new fiscal year starting inventory. The
     FSO will sign all the On Hand Summary Reports. Provide one copy to the food service accountant—
     send one copy to your MAJCOM food service manager and one to HQ AFSVA/SVOHF. CONTINUE

                                                  Chapter 6

                        WAR RESERVE MATERIEL (WRM) MANAGEMENT

6.1. Requirements. This section expands on responsibilities and policies in DoD Directive (DoDD)
3110.6, War Reserve Materiel Policy, and AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance
and Procedures. The War Consumable Distribution Objective (WCDO), USAF War and Mobilization
Plan (WMP-1, Annex GG), and MAJCOM Ration Requirements summary specify the number of days,
quantity, and type of rations to be maintained as WRM funded levels by the principle MAJCOM for stor-
age and use at the operational level.
     6.1.1. Only MAJCOM identified requirements are programmed and funded as WRM. Installations
     must coordinate all Air Force Operational Plan (OPLAN) requirements with their MAJCOM/SVX/
     Logistics Plans Office (LGX) for identification.
     6.1.2. MAJCOM/SVX/LGX provides their WRM ration requirements in writing to HQ AFSVA/
     SVOHF by 15 March annually. Requirements identified for locations that do not have an Air Force
     food service activity assigned will be stored at the nearest Air Force installation that has a food service
     activity.
     6.1.3. MAJCOM/SVX identifies and approves all self-sustaining unit ration requirements in their
     annual ration requirements summary. These units may store their rations instead of food service.
     Rations and all accountable forms will be issued on a hand receipt.
     6.1.4. The total Air Force wartime requirement for operational rations (Unitized Group Rations
     (UGR) and Meals Ready to Eat (MREs)) to support the Air Force two Major Theater War (MTW)
     Regional concept as identified in the Defense Guidance and WMP-1 are budgeted for by HQ AFSVA/
     SVO for storage at active duty bases having a requirement and with the Defense Logistics Agency in
     CONUS and OCONUS.

6.2. Requisitioning. Congress specifically approves WRM ration Essential Station Messing (ESM) for-
merly, Subsistence-in-Kind (SIK) funds (3500).
     6.2.1. HQ AFSVA/SVO approves any new or increased WRM requirements and places annual requi-
     sitions for all CONUS bases. WRM rations are only approved for storage at active duty bases that
     have an Air Force food service activity.
     6.2.2. Bases will not exceed WRM-funded levels.
     6.2.3. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF approves the release of depot-stocked rations for exercise use before req-
     uisitioning.

6.3. Storage. Where feasible, store all WRM rations under refrigeration (ideal temperature is 35-50
degrees Fahrenheit) to extend their shelf life. The maximum storage life is 36 months at 80 degrees Fahr-
enheit.
     6.3.1. If current facilities are inadequate for storage of WRM rations, the installation commander will
     provide space elsewhere on base. The facility will be under lock and key control of food service per-
     sonnel and must provide adequate security. Erect a physical barrier (floor to ceiling) to prevent theft
     or pilferage should the facility be jointly used with another base activity.
AFI34-239_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                        19


   6.3.2. Store WRM rations by lot number and date-of-pack on standard (40” X 48”) size pallets.
   6.3.3. WRM rations may be stored in the same warehouse as food service stocks. However, they will
   not be commingled together. WRM and food service rations should not be stacked more than three
   pallets high, without warehouse rack shelving.
   6.3.4. Food Service will not break down or store WRM rations individually on separate pallets for
   units.
   6.3.5. Rations stored by self-sustaining units are issued on AF Form 3516, with a Memorandum of
   Understanding (MOU) signed by the services and self-sustaining unit commanders. Refer to Attach-
   ment 7. Food service must account for these rations in the WRM account and report monthly on the
   AF Form 28, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Ration Report (RCS: HAF-SV(M)9601). Refer to
   Attachment 8 for reporting procedures.

6.4. Issues and Transfers. Do not issue rations directly from the WRM account. If sufficient rations are
not available in food service and WRM rations have to be used for emergencies, transfer them to the food
service account before issue. The Services commander or designated representative must approve the
release of all WRM rations in coordination with the base War Reserve Materiel Officer (WRMO) on AF
Form 3516.
   6.4.1. Active duty Air Force units cannot use unit funds to purchase operational rations, except for
   survival packets and emergency drinking water. Active duty units must obtain rations through food
   service. Food service will then issue rations to the unit with accountable forms and guidance for con-
   trol of ESM funds when the rations are used. Survival packets and drinking water will not be stored in
   the food service warehouse. Storage of these items is the unit’s responsibility.
   6.4.2. Issue all operational rations in full case lots only.
   6.4.3. Include date-of-pack and lot number of the rations issued on AF Form 3516.
   6.4.4. Transfer operational rations requiring Military Public Health inspection, in full cases only,
   from WRM to food service using AF Form 3516. Military Public Health inspectors provide DD Form
   1222, Request for and Results of Tests, to food service personnel for the quantity of destroyed
   rations during inspection.
   6.4.5. Return operational rations only to food service activities if there is a recurring demand for
   them. Accept full cases only and have Military Public Health inspectors to inspect the rations for ser-
   viceability before acceptance.
   6.4.6. For support of exercises and contingencies, transfer operational rations from one base to
   another using DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document. A document number
   must be obtained from HQ AFSVA/SVOHF and rations must be inspected by Military Public Health
   inspectors prior to shipment in accordance with DSCP Handbook 4155.2, Inspection of Meal,
   Ready-To-Eat (MRE) Rations (Appendix A). A copy of the inspection report will accompany the ship-
   ment.

6.5. Rotation. MAJCOM/SVX develops and monitors rotation of all pre-positioned WRM assets includ-
ing those stored in food service. Rotate MREs annually. Program and requisition one-third of all
WRM-funded levels of MREs annually (in November) based on storage conditions. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF
20                                                           AFI34-239_ANG_I 1 NOVEMBER 2006


will also inform the MAJCOM/SVX of the quantities and types of WRM stocks stored by DSCP in
CONUS that require rotation.
     6.5.1. Identify rations not used in local exercises, to the MAJCOM/SVX for redistribution to other
     installations.
     6.5.2. Place new rations in WRM upon receipt of annual replacement rations. Transfer the same
     quantity of the oldest date-of-pack in WRM to food service for rotation.
     6.5.3. Use AF Form 28, to report each type of operational ration (MRE and UGRs) by lot number and
     date-of-pack in the WRM account monthly. Refer to Attachment 8 for additional guidance on report-
     ing periods.

6.6. Inventory. Conduct inventories to determine the monetary value of WRM assets, physical quantities
on hand by date-of-pack, and lot number, to prepare inventory adjustments, or to certify the financial sta-
tus of the WRM account. WRM assets will not exceed the funded-level established by HQ AFSVA. Per-
form a inventory on the last workday of each month.
     6.6.1. Self-sustaining units will inventory rations issued on an AF Form 3516 monthly, and report the
     results to food service personnel. Include these rations on all physical inventories and reports.

6.7. Revaluation. Each fiscal year when the case price of MREs changes, food service will revalue MRE
inventories to account for the unit price change. Two AF Forms 28 will be submitted. Food Service will
conduct an end of fiscal year inventory on 30 September at the old case price. The quantity will be trans-
ferred to a new AF Form 28 for the next fiscal year on 1 October, with the new fiscal year case price.

6.8. Prescribed Forms. AF Forms 28, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Ration Report, and 1119-1,
Manual Monthly Monetary Report.

                                      Chapter 7 (Added-ANG)

FOOD SERVICE PROCEDURES FOR COMBAT READINESS TRAINING CENTERS (CRTC)

7.1. (Added-ANG) Deployed Unit Responsibilities. Deployed Units are responsible for menu plan-
ning, and proper ordering procedures to include operational rations. Forecasting the number of personnel,
menus and meal times should be pre-coordinated with CRTC support personnel to eliminate confusion
when units arrive.
   7.1.1. (Added-ANG) Deployed units are responsible for coordinating with CRTC Services person-
   nel. All items will normally be approved based on CRTC requirements. Deployed personnel will
   accomplish ordering of operational rations as well as movement and storage of these items. Any
   desired enhancements must be pre-coordinated with CRTC personnel. Units must coordinate with the
   CRTC 30 workdays prior to deployment on the following items:
       7.1.1.1. (Added-ANG) Menu planning.
       7.1.1.2. (Added-ANG) Personnel forecasting.
       7.1.1.3. (Added-ANG) Meal times.
   7.1.2. (Added-ANG) Deployed unit personnel, if requested and required by CRTC Services person-
   nel, will augment CRTC personnel in: (NOTE: All unit personnel provided must be fully trained in
   safety and security procedures)
       7.1.2.1. (Added-ANG) Store Room Operations.
       7.1.2.2. (Added-ANG) Inventory Control.

       7.1.2.4. (Added-ANG) Serving and cleaning of facilities and equipment.
7.2. (Added-ANG) Deployed Food Service Accounting. The deployed unit will complete the AF 1119,
monitored by CRTC food service managers. The CRTC will maintain the AF 1119 on file as a regular
dining facility operation. Deployed units will be annotated in Block 18 of the AF 1119.
   7.2.1. (Added-ANG) The official record copy of the AF 1119 will be completed and submitted by
   CRTC personnel. Units in training status are required to operate within authorized tolerances for a
   fixed facility. Units in training status are required to prepare a Memo for Record (MFR) when the AF
   1119 is out of tolerance in the 1119 web reporting system. This MFR will be sent to NGB/A1S by
   CRTC personnel explaining the reasons for the non-compliance. Amounts exceeding authorized toler-
   ances will be reimbursed by either DD form 448 or AF form 616.
7.3. (Added-ANG) CRTC Authority. CRTC Installation Commander’s will request deployed unit
complete AF 85, Report of Survey, if food service operations exceed standard tolerances. The CRTC
reserves the right and authority to make adjustments necessary to ensure compliance with regulatory guid-
ance. This includes, but is not limited to:

ordering, shipping, movement and storage. Once these rations are ordered and shipping is coordinated, the
CRTC must be contacted and advised as to when these rations will arrive and the incoming quantity.
7.5. (Added-ANG) Unit Inventory Procedures. Deployed units are required to maintain the food
inventory and will be monitored by CRTC food service managers for accuracy. The deployed unit will
conduct beginning and ending inventories with CRTC Services personnel prior to opening the first day
and leaving the last day using AF 3514, Inventory Count Worksheet.

                          USE OF AIR FORCE APF DINING FACILITIES

A3.1. The Air Force operates APF enlisted dining facilities in order to provide the subsistence entitle-
ment to enlisted members who reside in dormitories, to provide a training environment for food service
personnel to meet our war-fighting mission, and to provide flight meal service in support of daily opera-
tions. Generally, use of dining facilities is restricted to enlisted members and those individuals authorized
by the installation commander to meet mission requirements. Attachment 9 lists the meal rates for the
following customers and other situations where it is appropriate for the installation commander to autho-
rize other customers to eat meals in the dining facility. Meal rate charges are determined by the Under
Secretary of Defense, Comptroller (USD/C), and are published annually. All waivers to meal charges
must be approved by USD/C.

A3.2. Enlisted Members:
   A3.2.1. Enlisted members who are essential station messing (ESM) are authorized to use the dining
   facility at no charge.
   A3.2.2. Enlisted members who receive BAS are authorized to use the dining facility as a cash-paying
   customer.
   A3.2.3. Enlisted members receiving the meal portion of per diem are authorized to use the dining
   facility as a cash-paying customer.

A3.3. Officers:
   A3.3.1. Permanent party officers are not authorized to use the enlisted dining facility except as pro-
   vided below. The installation commander may authorize officers to eat meals in the dining facility
   after determining other facilities, including NAF food activities, base exchange cafeteria, and base
   restaurant, are not available, adequate, or readily accessible to the duty station.
   A3.3.2. Officers receiving a meal portion of per diem are authorized to use the dining facility when
   the authorization is included in the TDY orders by the orders authorizing official. Officers may only
   be authorized to use the dining facility at locations where the installation commander has determined
   government meals are available for DoD TDY travelers. Locations where government meals are
   available to TDY travelers are listed in AFMAN 34-255.

A3.4. Civilians:
   A3.4.1. Generally, permanent party civilian members of the DoD component are not authorized to
   use the enlisted dining facility. The installation commander may authorize DoD civilians to eat meals
   in the dining facility after determining other facilities, including NAF food activities, base exchange
   cafeteria, and base restaurant, are not available, adequate, or readily accessible to the duty location.
   A3.4.2. DoD civilians receiving a meal portion of per diem are authorized to use the dining facility
   upon presentation of their TDY orders. Civilians may only use the dining facility at locations where
   the installation commander has determined government meals to be available to DoD TDY travelers.

A3.5. Dependent family members of military personnel. Generally, dependent family members of
military personnel are not authorized to use the enlisted dining facility. When family members of military
personnel E1-E4 are authorized to eat in the enlisted dining facility, they are charged the discount meal
rate (food cost only). The installation commander may authorize family members of military members
and family members of DoD civilians assigned overseas to eat meals in the dining facility after determin-
ing other facilities, including NAF food activities, base exchange cafeteria, and base restaurant, are not
available or adequate.

A3.6. Retirees. Installation commanders have the authority to allow retirees to use the enlisted dining
facility. When making such a decision, the installation commander should consider the capability of the
dining facility, the service impact on delivering the subsistence entitlement to active duty enlisted mem-
bers, and the service impact on TDY travelers. Where such permission does not degrade our ability to
serve our primary customers, use of the enlisted dining facility may be granted.
