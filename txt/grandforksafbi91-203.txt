             SAMPLE LEVEL ONE (TIME-CRITICAL) RISK ASSESSMENT


MEMORANDUM FOR ALL EXERCISING UNITS

FROM: 319 ABW/SEW

SUBJECT: Operational Risk Assessment - Use of Training Munitions

1. The employment of training munitions to increase realism will be an integral part of Exercise
_______________. This risk assessment, encompassing the proposed use of training munitions
is submitted in accordance with AFPAM 90-902.

a. Hazard Identification:

(1) All hazard class 1.2 munitions have an associated blast/projection hazard. No mass
detonation hazard exists.

(2) All hazard class 1.3 munitions have an associated fire hazard and minor blast/projection
hazard. No mass explosive hazard exists.

(3) All hazard class 1.4 munitions have an associated minor blast hazard. No appreciable
projection hazard exists. Additionally, ground burst simulators pose a noise hazard if utilized in
enclosed spaces.

b. Risk Assessment:

(1) Hazard Exposure. The primary risk of exposure to associated hazards will be to the exercise
evaluation team members transporting/handling/activating the munitions. Secondary hazards
could be faced by unprotected personnel downwind of smoke-generating devices and/or in close
proximity to noise-producing/projection-producing devices.

(2) Hazard Severity. Our assessment of hazard severity is based on worst-case scenarios.

(a) The hazard severity for smoke producing, noise producing, and blast/projection-producing
munitions is rated as CRITICAL. These items are fully capable of causing severe injury to
personnel through improper use or unintentional activation.

(b) The hazard severity for fire-producing munitions is rated as CATASTROPHIC due to the
abundance of combustible materials in the training area and the speed at which fire is capable of
spreading. An out-of-control fire is capable of causing personnel death, loss of equipment, or
widespread environmental damage.

(c) The hazard severity for the possible introduction of live small arms ammunition into the
exercise area is rated as CATASTROPHIC. This hazard could cause personnel death.
 10                                                 GRANDFORKSAFBI91-203 13 MAY 2013


(3) Hazard Probability.

(a) The hazard probability for smoke producing, noise producing, and blast/projection-
producing munitions is rated as SELDOM. The probability of an occurrence of the severity
indicated in paragraph 1b(2)(a) is “unlikely, but could occur in the life of the system. ”

(b) The hazard probability for fire-producing munitions is rated as OCCASIONAL. The
probability of an occurrence of the severity indicated in paragraph 1b(2)(b) is “will occur in the
life of the system.”

(c) The hazard probability for the introduction of live small arms ammunition into the exercise
area is rated as SELDOM. The probability of an occurrence of the severity indicated in
paragraph 1b(2)(c) is “unlikely, but could occur in the life of the system.”

(4) Complete Risk Assessment. The following overall risk assessment ratings are based on the
Risk Assessment Matrix contained in Figure 7 of AFPAM 90-902. This risk assessment is
based on raw data and reflects the risks prior to application of control measures.

(a) The overall risk of severe injury to personnel resulting from the use of smoke-producing,
noise-producing, and blast/projection-producing munitions is MEDIUM.

(b) The overall risk of death to personnel, loss of equipment, or widespread environmental
damage resulting from the use of fire-producing munitions is HIGH.

(c) The overall risk of death to personnel resulting from the introduction of live small arms
ammunition into the exercise area is HIGH.

c. Analyze Control Measures:

(1) Identify Control Measures:

(a) Munitions will be transported/handled/activated only by members who have been trained in
the use of the specific munitions to be expended, in accordance with AFMAN 91-201 and this
instruction.

(b) Qualified Security Force members will inspect all weapons prior to entry into exercise areas
to ensure that no member has live small arms ammunition introduced. Blank adapters will be
affixed to all weapons, and weapons will not be fired at personnel, vehicles, or buildings with a
facing window when within 20 feet.

(c) Munitions will only be expended in pre-designated areas, (as approved by 319 ABW/SEW),
that have been cleared of combustible material to a minimum circumference of 10 feet.

(d) All personnel handling explosive or heat producing training munitions will wear leather
work gloves. All personnel expending noise-producing training munitions will wear hearing
protection.
GRANDFORKSAFBI91-203 13 MAY 2013                                                                   11


(e) Smoking is not permitted within 50 feet of any munitions storage or handling location.

(f) Proper firefighting equipment must be present when munitions are expended and within 50
feet of munitions storage areas. Contact the Fire Prevention Office (7-4174) if you need
assistance.

(g) Smoke-producing munitions will be permitted to cool for 10-15 minutes following their
expenditure.

(h) In the event of munitions malfunction, training exercise team members will secure the site
and contact EOD personnel to perform render-safe operations. The Wing Commander will be
immediately notified.

(2) Determine Control Effects:

(a) The control measures indicated for smoke-producing, noise producing, and blast/projection-
producing munitions will reduce the hazard severity/probability from CRITICAL/SELDOM to
NEGLIGIBLE/UNLIKELY.

(b) The control measures indicated for fire-producing munitions would reduce the hazard
severity/probability from CATASTROPHIC/OCCASIONAL to NEGLIGIBLE/SELDOM (the
“seldom” probability allows for the increased fire threat if extremely dry environmental
conditions are present).

(c) The control measures indicated for introduction of live small arms ammunition into the
exercise area will reduce the hazard severity/probability from CATASTROPHIC/SELDOM to
NEGLIGIBLE/UNLIKELY.

(d) Prioritize Control Measures (certain control measures are common to more than one hazard):

1. Since fire is perceived as the greatest threat, the control measures associated with controller
training and fire/burn hazard control are given top priority (items 1c(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g), and
(h)). Through history, these munitions have consistently demonstrated the highest probability of
hazard occurrence and, once a fire is started, have the greatest severity potential.

2. Smoke-producing, noise-producing, and blast/projection-producing munitions are evaluated
as the secondary threat, and the control measures associated with controller training, blast
hazards, and inhalation hazards are applicable (items 1c(1)(a), (c), (d), and (e)). This category
received a higher priority than small arms ammunition due to a much higher probability of
occurrence.

3. Hazards associated with the introduction of live small arms ammunition are evaluated as a
tertiary threat, and items associated with controller training and ammunition control are
applicable (items 1c(1)(a) and (b)). This category, although having a high severity potential, was
rated third due to its low probability of occurrence.

d. Make Control Decisions: All control measures will be implemented and strictly enforced by
 12                                                GRANDFORKSAFBI91-203 13 MAY 2013


training exercise team members. The measures stated will significantly reduce associated
hazards and should not cause a negative impact on deployment operations.

(1) Select Risk Controls: Since all risk control measures will be implemented, selection is not
required.

(2) Make Risk Decision: Based on the implementation of the stated control measures, it is our
opinion that the benefits of the operation far exceed the reduced level of risk involved. The only
exception would be in the event of extremely dry environmental conditions at the exercise site.
Should these conditions occur, the Wing Commander and Exercise Team Chief will reassess the
risk of utilizing fire-producing munitions.

e. Implement Risk Controls:

(1) Risk controls will be included in the lesson plan for munitions training and in the exercise
rules of engagement.

(2) The accountable person will be the commander of the exercising unit.

f. Supervise and Review: Control measures will be monitored and reviewed on a daily basis.
Any problems noted will be immediately brought to the attention of the accountable officer and
Wing Commander for resolution. Where sufficient changes cannot be made to resolve the
