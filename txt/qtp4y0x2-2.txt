Supersedes QTP 4Y0X2-2, 01 Sep. 2001
Introduction ______________________________________________________ i

       Volume 2, Fixed Prosthodontics, contains modules on such procedures as fabricating
post and cores; full gold, metal-ceramic, and metal-resin restorations, and porcelain laminate
veneers. This QTP is designed to enhance 5- and 7-skill level OJT of dental laboratory
personnel. The 4Y0X2 Career Development Courses may be used to compliment the training
references listed in a module. All QTPs are intended to be used by trainees, trainers,
supervisors, and task certifiers. Before initiating any training you should review your
responsibilities—as a supervisor/trainer—for conducting on-the-job training (OJT) per AFI
36-2201, Volume 3, Air Force Training Program On The Job Training Administration.

         Six months after the apprentice graduates, you should receive a survey that allows
you to evaluate the in-residence apprentice course. This poll is a valuable tool; your
feedback is critical to improving our 3 level course and your career field. Subsequently, 3-
skill level training provides a foundation for your OJT. Once you begin upgrade training you
are required to use the QTPs.

        QTPs are designed to help you conduct and evaluate your field training. QTPs
provide continuity to the trainee’s upgrade training and are divided into the following
volumes: 1) General Dental Laboratory Experience; 2) Fixed Prosthodontics; 3) Treatment
and Orthodontic Appliances, Complete and Removable Partial Dentures; 4) Dental
Laboratory Administration; 5) Medical Material; and 6) Supervision and Training. The
QTP modules were written to assist you in preparing for and conducting training. You must
use the QTP modules for training when the STS task is a core task (minimum qualification
for the specialty). Each module segments the major tasks into teachable elements. Your goal
is to provide enough training and guidance so trainees can do all task related steps, without
assistance, and produce an appliance that meets local requirements for speed and accuracy.
QTPs also aid OJT task certifiers in evaluating the trainee’s demonstrated performance. If
you have local training requirements not covered by a QTP module you should develop
“steps in performance” and “performance checklists” that support and standardize those
tasks.

        Accompanying each volume of QTPs is a qualification training progress record.
This QTP record serves as an interim document to record the date trainee completes each
module. Every person in qualification/upgrade training must have this QTP progress record
filed in their OJT folder. Use and annotation of this progress record is similar to current OJT
documentation. When you are satisfied the trainee meets standards, as prescribed in the QTP
performance checklist, you must document and initial each task completion date in the “date
completed” column in the QTP progress record. If a person is being recertified on a task that
is supported by a QTP you must use that module to complete the recertification process.

       Typically, you will manage each module by first, training the tasks and then,
evaluating performance. Your local steps in performance may vary from the method listed in
the QTP module. If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to the first half of
each module, (i.e. steps in task performance); however, the “performance checklist” is
considered a standard and cannot be altered. You may train each QTP volume/module in
any sequence; however, when conducting training use an organized and methodical
approach. This will reduce your training time and enhance your efforts.
Introduction ______________________________________________________ ii


            For effective use of this QTP, conduct training in the following manner:
       1.   Review the procedures in each module with the trainee.
       2.   Direct the trainee to review the training references listed to prepare for task
            performance.
       3.   Review the steps in task performance with the trainee, allowing enough time to
            adequately train each step (some modules may take longer to teach).
       4.   Evaluate the trainee’s work at each critical step—using the performance
            checklist at this point will be helpful.
       5.   Fifth, evaluate the trainee’s performance and provide feedback on any areas for
            improvement.
       6.   Finally, when the trainee has successfully completed the task you must
            document and initial both the STS and the QTP progress record. If the trainee
            does not accomplish the module, conduct follow-up instruction until the trainee
            successfully completes the task.

            The QTP project goal of the 381st Training Squadron, Sheppard AFB TX, is to
     publish a useable document for trainers and trainees. You are encouraged to write-in
     changes or revisions to the QTPs. A corrections/improvements letter is located on the
     last page of each QTP volume. You may choose to call in your recommendations to
     DSN 736-6906 or FAX DSN/Commercial 736-2781 or (940) 676-2781 or email the
     author at andrea.bates@sheppard.af.mil.
