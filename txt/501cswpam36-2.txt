              Complainants have various protected communication channels
              for voicing their Equal Opportunity & Treatment related
              concerns. Any person who becomes aware of discriminatory
              practices should refer the complaint to his/her respective chain
              of command for resolution. If the complainant and alleged
              offender are from different agencies, leadership should use this
              pamphlet for appropriate notification and resolution of the
              complainant’s concerns.       At this point, the Equal
THE PROCESS



              Opportunity & Treatment Counselors (Agency
              Advisors) should be notified using the chart on page 5
              of this pamphlet.

              The Equal Opportunity & Treatment Counselors for
              the complainant and alleged offender should begin the
              coordination process. The purposes of coordination are to
              ensure the rights of the complainant and alleged offender in
              complaints processes are not violated, and to provide an avenue
              for identification and notification within the appropriate chain of
              command (on a need-to-know basis).               In addition, the
              counselors determine the most appropriate method for resolving
              the complainant’s concerns in accordance with their respective
              policies and guidelines.


              The Equal Opportunity & Treatment Counselor for the
              complainant should make the appropriate notifications
              to leadership using the example format provided on
              page 6. The primary purpose for the initial notifications are to
              inform the appropriate leadership of allegations crossing
              organizational boundaries and to provide them specific
              recommendations on how to best move forward in resolving a
              complaint.

                           3
              The Equal Opportunity & Treatment Counselor for the
              complainant should coordinate with the appropriate
              legal officials; usually the host legal office. This
              coordination allows legal officials to review the respective
              policies of the different agencies and provide any additional
              guidance for resolving the complainant’s concerns. The sample
              format provided on page 7 may be used.
THE PROCESS




              After legal coordination, the Equal Opportunity &
              Treatment Counselor for the complainant should
              communicate any process changes to those with a need
              to know and execute the agreed upon process for
              resolving the complainant’s concerns.




              The Equal Opportunity & Treatment Counselor for the
              complainant should brief the disposition of the process
              to leadership on a need-to-know basis. In addition,
              both counselors should coordinate any             administrative
              requirements necessary for appropriate closure.
