1. General.
     1.1. EWIR is a communication intensive process, requiring close interaction with multiple
     wing agencies and is directed by the 31 Operational Support Squadron (OSS) Electronic
     Combat Pilot (ECP).
     1.2. EWIR is developed and implemented through PACER WARE and SERENE BYTE
     Messages from the Air Warfare Center (AWC) and HQ USAFE/A3TW. PACER WARE is
     the unclassified term for an actual change or notification of a deficiency to an Electronic
     Warfare (EW) system. SERENE BYTE is the unclassified term for an exercise change or
     deficiency notification to an EW system. This instruction governs how the 31 FW will
     respond to an EWIR Message.
     1.3. During contingency operations or periods of increased operations tempo the 31
     OSS/OSK ECP may request a waiver letter from the 31 Operations Group Commander
     (OG/CC) to excuse the 31 FW from participating in SERENE BYTE exercises. The ECP
     will then distribute copies of this waiver letter to all 31 FW agencies responsible for EWIR
     notification or processing.
     1.4. Successful EWIR implementation requires a continuous flow of information between all
     participants. All 31 FW units affected by an EWIR implementation will maintain contact
     with the 31 OSS/OSK ECP.
2. Notification.
     2.1. Attachment 2 shows a flow chart schematic of the notification process for an EWIR
     Message.
     2.2. Upon receipt of an EWIR Message the Command Post will immediately notify the 31st
     Maintenance Group (MXG) Maintenance Operation Center (MOC) and the 31 OSS/OSK
     ECP. If the 31 OSS/OSK ECP cannot be contacted, the Command Post will then contact an
     alternate listed on the 31 OSS/OSK PACER WARE/SERENE BYTE message recall roster.
3. EWIR Message Types.
     3.1. The four primary EWIR Message types are listed in AFI 10-703.
4. 31 FW EWIR Response.
     4.1. Upon receipt of a Serene Byte/Pacer Ware message, Command Post personnel will
     immediately notify the 31 OSS/OSK ECP and 31 MXG MOC via telephone. Only the
     unclassified title will be passed over the telephone. Additionally, during telephonic
     notification the Command Post will also advise on the methods of dissemination available
     (NIPRNET, SIPRNET, Hardcopy (except for the MOC, AUTODIN receipt will require pick-
     up). The Command Post will log the time and name of the ECP/MOC personnel notified.
     ECP and MOC action will be dependent upon the EW system listed in Attachment 11,
     Appendix A (or Appendix B when supporting deployed Combat Air Force (CAF) units
     during contingency operations), then the ECP and MOC will take the following actions:
        4.1.1. System Impact Message (SIM):
AVIANOABI10-703 20 AUGUST 2013                                                             3


        4.1.1.1. The 31 OSS/OSK ECP will immediately download the message using secure
        electronic means. After reviewing the message the ECP will give copies to the Wing
        Weapons Officer, each squadron’s ECP and Weapons Officer, as a last resort, the
        ECP will leave a copy of the message with the squadron Top-3. During contingency
        operations the ECP will immediately notify the 31 FW/CC, 31 OG/CC, and 31
        MXG/CC. Otherwise, the ECP will notify the 31 FW/CC, 31 OG/CC, and 31
        MXG/CC as soon as possible during normal duty. In all cases the 31 OSS/OSK ECP
        will research and advise the 31 OG/CC of all available options to counter or minimize
        the identified EW shortfall.
        4.1.1.2. The 31 MXG MOC will immediately notify the Aircraft Maintenance
        Squadron’s Production Supervisors who in turn will immediately notify their
        designated Avionics Specialist personnel. The MOC will also notify the primary or
        alternate POC from the 31 MXG Wing Avionics Manager (WAM) using the recall
        roster supplied by the 31 MXG/WAM. MOC will record the time and name of each
        person notified. If the maintainers in the Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMUs) cannot
        download the message using secure electronic means then the AMUs are responsible
        for dispatching a courier to pick up the EWIR message from the MOC. If the
        message concerns the ALQ-131 Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) pod then the
        MOC will also immediately notify the 31 MXS/MXMVE. If the 31 MXS/MXMVE
        cannot download the message using secure electronic means then the 31
        MXS/MXMVE is responsible for dispatching a courier to pick up the EWIR message
        from the MOC.
     4.1.2. Reprogramming Impact Message (RIM):
        4.1.2.1. The 31 OSS/OSK ECP will download the message using secure electronic
        means as soon as practical. Immediate action is not required. For example, if
        notified in the evening or on the weekend, then the ECP will download the message
        first thing the next day. After reviewing the message the ECP will notify the 31
        FW/CC, 31 OG/CC, 31 MXG/CC, Wing Weapons Officer and each squadron’s ECP
        or Weapons Officer and provide them a copy of the RIM if needed. A RIM logically
        precedes an Implementation Message (IMP). Therefore, the ECP will contact HQ
        USAFE/A3TW and ask if an IMP will follow the RIM. If so, the ECP will advise the
        Wing Weapons Officer and instruct the squadrons’ ECP/Weapons Officer to have
        their maintenance personnel download the appropriate software from the Multi-
        Service EW Data Distribution System (MSDDS) and be prepared to reprogram the
        affected EW system.
        4.1.2.2. The 31 MXG MOC will respond identically to a RIM as described earlier for
        an EWIR SIM.
     4.1.3. Maintenance Instruction Message (MIM) or TCT Message:
        4.1.3.1. The 31 OSS/OSK ECP will immediately notify the Wing Weapons Officer
        and each squadron weapons officer or ECP and read them the unclassified EWIR
        message title. If the squadron does not require further assistance then the 31
        OSS/OSK ECP will treat this message as a RIM. If the MIM or TCT Message
        requires further clarification then the 31 OSS/OSK ECP will coordinate with HQ
        USAFE/A3TW for clarification.
 4                                                     AVIANOABI10-703 20 AUGUST 2013


           4.1.3.2. The 31 MXG MOC will respond identically to a MIM or TCT Message as
           described earlier for an EWIR SIM.
        4.1.4. IMP:
           4.1.4.1. The 31 OSS/OSK ECP will immediately notify the 31 FW/CC, 31 OG/CC,
           and 31 MXG/CC. The ECP will then notify the Wing Weapons Officer, each
           squadron’s ECP and Weapons Officer. If none is available, then as a last resort the
           ECP will notify the squadron Top-3. Prior to reprogramming the ECP will ensure the
           squadron’s ECP or Weapons Officer is aware of all changes to the affected EW
           systems. Once reprogramming begins, the ECP will work directly with the 31
           MXG/WAM to facilitate a timely and efficient reprogramming process. The ECP
           will notify and keep the 31 OG/CC and the Wing Weapons Officer informed of the
           reprogramming status. Once reprogramming is complete for the 31 FW the ECP will
           submit a Unit Load Message (ULM) within 72 hours to HQ USAFE/A3TW. The
           ECP will include the appropriate offices at the 53 WG and 16 AF as information
           recipients when sending the ULM. The ULM will state the 31 FW is in compliance
           and will give the completion time and any problems encountered. Finally, the ECP
           will notify the 31 FW/CC and 31 OG/CC when all reprogramming is complete and
           RIM is complied with HQ USAFE/A3TW.
           4.1.4.2. The 31 MXG MOC will respond in an urgent manner to an IMP using the
           procedures described earlier for an EWIR SIM. In addition, the MOC will record the
           start and completion time of the first and last 31 FW aircraft modified. MOC will also
           notify the ECP of completion of reprogramming.

                      31 OSS/OSK ECP PROCEDURES FOR EWIR

A3.1. The 31 OSS/OSK ECP is responsible for the Electronic Warfare (EW) systems listed in
Attachment 11, Appendix A and will notify the appropriate 31 FW agencies with changes to
these systems. In addition, the 31 OSS/OSK ECP will notify and assist the ECP of any USAF
units deployed to the 31FW affected by a PACER WARE Message. When USAF CAF units
deploy to the 31 FW in support of contingency operations the ECP will update Appendix B to
reflect a current listing of EW systems deployed to the 31FW.
A3.2. In the 31 OSS/OSK ECP’s absence, the alternate ECP will assume these responsibilities.
The 31 OSS/OSK ECP will train and prepare all alternates to assume the responsibilities of the
31 OSS/OSK ECP in the 31 OSS/OSK ECP’s absence. The 31 OSS/OSK ECP will provide the
31 FW/CP a list of alternate personnel to contact in his/her absence. The ECP will ensure all
designated alternates are authorized to receive classified messages.
A3.3. See Attachment 2 for a flow chart schematic of the notification process for an EWIR
message.
A3.4. When notified of a PACER WARE / SERENE BYTE message the Command Post
personnel will read the unclassified message title line to the ECP over the telephone. If the
message pertains to an EW system listed in Attachment 11, Appendix A or B, then the ECP will
respond as described in paragraph 4 of this instruction.
A3.5. When notified of a RIM the 31 OSS/OSK ECP will contact HQ USAFE/A3TW and ask if
an IMP will follow. If HQ USAFE/A3TW confirms an IMP will follow then the 31 OSS/OSK
ECP will ask HQ USAFE/A3TW to send the unclassified portion of the IMP via unclassified
email directly to the 31 OSS/OSK ECP. When received the 31 OSS/OSK ECP will respond to
this IMP as described in paragraph 4 of this instruction.
A3.6. In addition, the ECP will notify the 31 FW/CC, OG/CC, MXG/CC, and OSS/CC of all
pertinent EWIR messages. Further, during all EWIR implementations, the ECP will, as required,
provide periodic status updates to the 31 FW/CC, OG/CC, MXG/CC, and OSS/CC. Likewise,
the 31 OSS/OSK ECP will ensure each squadron’s Weapon Officer and/or ECP are informed of
the latest EW changes immediately especially before EWIR implementation occurs.
A3.7. For PACER WARE Messages that affect the 31FW the ECP will give the squadrons a
memo describing the impact on our tactics or EW systems. This memo will be included in the
Weapons Read File. The 31 OSS/OSK ECP will work with 31 OSS/IN to update the 31 FW
smart packs with the latest EW changes.
A3.8. The 31 OSS/OSK ECP will file and catalog electronically all pertinent EWIR messages
on the appropriately-classified network under the 31 OSS/OSK folder.

A4.1. This attachment establishes procedures for 31 FW/CP response to PACER
WARE/SERENE BYTE messages.
A4.2. Upon receipt of a PACER WARE/SERENE BYTE message the CP will immediately
notify the 31 OSS/OSK ECP and the 31 MXG MOC. If the 31 OSS/OSK ECP cannot be
contacted, the CP will then contact an alternate listed on the PACER WARE / SERENE BYTE
recall roster logging the date and name of all personnel notified. NOTE: Only the unclassified
title will be read over unsecure lines.
A4.3. The CP will ensure dissemination of PACERWARE/SERENE BYTE messages following
telephonic notifications. Electronic (NIPR/SIPR) will be forwarded over the appropriate system
received. Hardcopy messages will always be delivered to the MOC regardless of system of
receipt. ECP will have to arrange pick-up from the Command Post of hardcopy AUTODIN
messages.
A4.4. The CP will notify the Mission Director (if Battlestaff formed). When requested by the 31
OSS/OSK ECP, the CP will notify the 31 OG/CC and 31 MXG/CC.
A4.5. During reprogramming, the CP will provide notification assistance to the 31 OSS/OSK
ECP if required.
A4.6. The CP will participate as a member of the EWIR Action Team when required by the 31
OSS/OSK ECP.
