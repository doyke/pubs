                                          Chapter 1

                      AIR FORCE ANTITERRORISM PROGRAM

1.1. Air Force Antiterrorism Program. This instruction establishes guidance and procedures
for the Air Force Antiterrorism Program and supports the Department of Defense AT Program.
The AT Program is a high priority, comprehensive program which focuses on defensive
measures to reduce the risk to AF personnel and property to terrorist acts. The guidance and
procedures for AT risk management provide guidance on collecting and disseminating timely
terrorist threat information, guide development and support the implementation of
comprehensive AT plans, ensure AT training and exercises for all AF members, provide
guidance for allocation and application of AT resources, and establish procedures for
comprehensive AT program reviews.
1.2. AT Responsibility. AT is a command responsibility which must be thoroughly integrated
into every unit mission. Commanders and equivalents at all levels have the responsibility and
authority to enforce appropriate AT standards and measures. Commanders and equivalents must
be aware of evolving threats against their command and continually review their AT posture
using the Integrated Defense Risk Management Process (IDRMP), to manage risk and
appropriately adjust the posture of elements and personnel subject to their control. The next
level up the chain of command must be notified and mitigate or accept any AT risk that cannot
be controlled to an acceptable level within a commander's resources.
   1.2.1. The Major Command (MAJCOM) AT Program Manager (ATPM), the Numbered Air
   Force (NAF) Antiterrorism Officer (ATO), the Installation ATO, and the Unit Antiterrorism
   Representative (ATR) are advisors to commanders at each respective level. They shall not
   assume AT responsibility but are charged with advising the commander or equivalent on AT
   issues, managing the AT Program, and coordinating implementation of the AT Program.
   1.2.2. The AF Antiterrorism program is a cross-functional supported program which utilizes
   the skills and expertise of a variety of AF professionals. MAJCOM and Installation
   Commanders will identify personnel on their staff to oversee the antiterrorism program and
   act as the subject matter expert responsible for executing both DoD and AF-directed AT
   requirements across a major command or installation, and coordinates the efforts of key
   functional areas to ensure synergy on behalf of the commander. At a minimum, Security
   Forces, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), Intelligence, Civil Engineers (to
   include Emergency Management, Engineering Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Fire
   Emergency Services), Force Support, Command Post, Public Affairs, Communications,
   Contracting, Operations, Public Health and Bioenvironmental Engineering (food and water),
   Judge Advocate, and Comptroller must coordinate efforts to achieve an effective AT posture.
   The installation ATO is responsible to coordinate among these key players and facilitate the
   integration and coordination of their efforts on behalf of the commander. As a sub-element
   of the overarching FP program, AT must be integrated with and complement other programs
   supporting FP.
   1.2.3. Additionally, an effective AT program requires participation from every member of
   the force. Each individual must maintain awareness of potential terrorist threats, practice
   personal security measures, and report suspicious activity.
 6                                          AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014


        1.2.3.1. (Added-PACAF) NAF, installation, unit, and tenant commanders are
        responsible for implementing DoD, AF, USPACOM and USNORTHCOM (Alaska
        installations) AT policy within their organizations.
        1.2.3.2. (Added-PACAF) The AT standards in this AFI incorporates USPACOM
        OPORD 5050-08 and additional PACAF AT guidance.
     1.2.4. The AT Program shall be considered when establishing and exercising support
     agreements or mutual aid agreements (MAA) with local agencies, whether CONUS or
     OCONUS. At a minimum, agreements must establish procedures for information sharing,
     must address AT capabilities and limitations, and must outline roles and responsibilities
     during response to acts of terrorism. If agreements with outside agencies do not provide
     sufficient support to the AT program, associated vulnerabilities will be entered into Core
     Vulnerability Assessment Management Program (CVAMP) explaining the lack of support.
     1.2.5. Installation AT planning shall include a communications plan to inform the base
     populace through Public Affairs of the need to report suspicious activities/incidents, the
     nature of items to be reported, and how to report them.
        1.2.5.1. Eagle Eyes. The Eagle Eyes program is an Air Force AT initiative that enlists
        the eyes and ears of Air Force members, civilians, contractors, and dependants. The
        Eagle Eyes program will inform the community on how to recognize possible terrorist
        activity and how to report suspicious behavior. Armed with this information, all
        individuals can recognize elements of potential terror planning when they see it. The
        program provides a network of local, 24-hour phone numbers to call whenever a
        suspicious activity is observed. Each installation shall establish procedures to receive
        and log suspicious activity reports and suspicious incident reports (SAR/SIR) and to pass
        those reports expeditiously to their servicing AFOSI detachment for appropriate action.
        Eagle Eyes is an AFOSI-led program requiring close and continuous liaison and
        coordination between the installation Security Forces Squadron, AFOSI Detachment,
        Installation ATO, Command Post, Public Affairs office and others. This program
        implements the spirit and intent of DoDI 2000.26, Suspicious Activity Reporting. See
        Attachment 7 for the categories of suspicious activities that are required to be reported.
        1.2.5.2. Security Forces Squadrons shall develop local procedures, in concert with their
        supporting AFOSI Detachment, to log and track SAR/SIR in order to expeditiously
        submit all reporting received from the public or other sources with a possible/potential
        linkage to terrorism using the eGuardian system. MAJCOM ATPM, Installation ATO,
        and Information Fusion Cell (IFC) will have “read” access to the eGuardian system.
        Categories of information to report via eGuardian are shown at Attachment 7 to this
        publication. AFOSI is the OPR for eGuardian and shall make any necessary entries to
        the system.
1.3. AF AT Program Policy. The AF AT Program supports and implements DoD policy as
described in DoDI 2000.12, which establishes DoD policies and responsibilities for AT. AT
standards and AF-specific guidance for implementing the AT Program will be established based
on guidance in DoDI 2000.16.
     1.3.1. Geographic Combatant Commander (GCC) AT Policy Precedence. IAW the Unified
     Command Plan (UCP) and DoDI 2000.12, GCC AT policies take precedence over the AT
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                        7


   policies and programs of any other DoD Component operating or existing in the GCC area of
   responsibility (AOR) except for those under the security responsibility of a Chief of Mission
   (CoM), to include exercising tactical control (TACON) for FP. TACON for FP is in addition
   to a Combatant Commander’s normal exercise of operational control (OPCON) over
   assigned forces. All DoD personnel traveling into a GCC’s AOR shall familiarize
   themselves and comply with all AOR-specific AT policies. AF Components to GCCs bridge
   gaps between GCC and AF policies. In the application of AT policy, the more restrictive
   guidance will be applied.
   1.3.2. AT Policy Concerning Tenants and Privatized Support on AF Property. All tenant
   units, non-DoD tenants, DoD elements, and privatized support to AF property and activities
   shall be included in the AT Program, adhere to AT requirements, and participate in the host
   installation AT Program. Commanders shall ensure agreements are in place which
   specifically obligate compliance with the AT requirements in this AFI and with applicable
   portions of Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) standards.
   1.3.3. AT Policy Regarding Travel. All personnel (military, civilians, dependent family
   members, and contractors supporting DoD operations IAW contract provisions) shall comply
   with GCC, theater, country, and special clearance requirements (Electronic Department of
   Defense Foreign Clearance Guide, https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/) prior to departing the
   continental United States (CONUS), traveling into another GCC’s AOR, or traveling
   between countries outside the continental United States (OCONUS). AF personnel in-transit
   on Leave/Temporary Duty (TDY) or deployment orders shall also comply with AT Standard
   29 of this AFI.
   1.3.4. (Added-PACAF) USPACOM OPORD 5050-08 is the GCC guidance for all PACAF
   AOR Installations and will be adhered to over all other guidance.
1.4. AT Program Roles and Responsibilities.
   1.4.1. General. AF commanders at all levels (or equivalent civilian directors) assigned AT
   responsibility shall establish and maintain active AT programs IAW DoD, GCC, AF, and all
   other applicable AT guidance. All commanders have the authority and responsibility to
   enforce appropriate security measures to ensure the protection of DoD elements and
   personnel subject to their control while pursuing mission accomplishment and shall ensure
   the AT awareness and readiness of all DoD elements and personnel assigned or attached.
      1.4.1.1. AF organizations/activities shall develop local guidance to implement this
      Instruction, such as MAJCOM or installation supplements/instructions/plans, that identify
      AT-specific operational responsibilities, to include the scope of AT responsibility for
      facilities and operations that do not meet the legal definition of an installation (e.g.,
      recruiting offices and other geographically separated units [GSUs]).
      1.4.1.2. AT activities shall support GCCs as they exercise overall responsibility for AT

   2.3.1. AT programs shall employ the IDRMP process IAW AFI 31-101, to assess the risk to
   the installation or facility, because of the presence of terrorist threats, annually or as changes
   occur.
   2.3.2. Risk management is a continuous process. The risk management process and
   procedures shall be reviewed by the ATWG and approved by the ATEC annually or as
   changes occur. See Figure 2.1 for a graphic depiction.

Figure 2.1. AT Risk Management Process




      2.3.2.1. (Added-PACAF) The AT Risk Management process will be incorporated into
      the installation antiterrorism plan. Refer to AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, Chapter 3
      for the Integrated Defense Risk Management process. This should be the guide to
      determine how the commander plans for risk management. The commander’s risk
      acceptance letter will remain on file with the installation IDRMP Program Manager and
      the ATPM.
2.4. Standard 4: Terrorism Threat Assessment.
   2.4.1. The threat assessment process shall be established consistent with the IDRMP outlined
   in AFI 31-101, to identify the full range of known or estimated threat capabilities (including
   the use or threat of CBRNE). These assessments shall be updated on an annual basis or more
   frequently as the threat environment dictates, or upon changes to the DIA or GCC TTL.
   Assessments shall be tailored to local conditions. For each group that may pose a threat, at a
   minimum, the assessment shall provide the following information: the group’s intent, tactics,
   techniques and procedures (TTP), capability, probable course of action (COA), history, and
   any specific targeting information that may be available. AFOSI is the AF agency
   responsible for preparing the DTA as prescribed in DoDI 5240.18, Counterintelligence (CI)
   Analysis and Production; DoD O-2000.12-H; and AFI 71-101, Volume 4,
   Counterintelligence.
      2.4.1.1. A DBT shall be established for each installation to identify and evaluate the
      various weapons and tactics most likely to be used by terrorist groups. The DBT will be
      used to help establish the base’s defensive posture and is critical for engineering projects
      and renovations. In the absence of a credible threat, the baseline UFC standards can be
      used as the installation’s DBT.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                          23


   2.4.2. Specific threat assessments are also prepared to support operational planning and risk
   decisions for unique mission requirements or special events including, but not limited to, in-
   transit forces, training and exercises, and operational deployments. AFOSI is responsible for
   preparing specific threat assessments.
   2.4.3. Effective processes should be implemented to integrate and fuse all sources of
   available threat information from local, State, Federal and host nation law enforcement
   agencies; the appropriate local, State, Federal and host nation intelligence community
   activities; other local community officials and individuals; the applicable U.S. country team;
   port authority officials and husbanding contractors, as appropriate, to provide for a
   continuous analysis of threat information to support the threat warning process IAW
   Standard 2.
   2.4.4. Threat assessments are integrated into the AT risk management process as a major
   source of analysis and justification for recommendations and implementation of Random
   Antiterrorism Measures (RAMs); AT enhancements, including physical security, emergency
   management or FHP changes; program and budget requests; and when conducting AT VAs.
   2.4.5. Other targeted Threat Assessments will be reviewed by the TWG and incorporated
   into AT planning.
2.5. Standard 5: Criticality Assessment.
   2.5.1. Criticality assessment processes shall be conducted IAW the IDRMP outlined in AFI
   31-101, to identify, classify and prioritize missions, including mission-essential personnel,
   assets and information.
       2.5.1.1. Criticality assessments shall also be conducted for non-mission essential assets
       such as primary gathering buildings (routinely occupied by 50 or more DoD personnel),
       special events (involving 300 or more DoD members), energy infrastructure and any
       other facility, equipment, service or resource deemed important by the commander
       warranting protective measures to ensure continued efficient operation, protection from
       disruption, degradation or destruction, and timely restoration. Additional guidance for
       criticality assessments can be found in DoD Antiterrorism Handbook.
       2.5.1.2. Criticality assessments shall be updated at least annually to determine the degree
       of asset criticality. Criticality assessments shall provide the basis for identifying those
       assets that require specific protective measures and priorities for resource allocation when
       developing and updating AT-related plans [e.g., AT Plan, Comprehensive Emergency
       Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2, Contingency Response Plan (CRP), MCRP, IDP, etc.].
   2.5.2. Criticality assessments should be coordinated with affected Defense Critical
   Infrastructure Program (DCIP) and Air Force CARM, and conducted IAW the principles in
   DoDD 3020.40, DoD Policy and Responsibilities for Critical Infrastructure, and AFPD 10-
   24, Air Force Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP), and identify defense critical
   infrastructure and critical assets. Criticality assessments for DCIP and AF CARM assets will
   be conducted IAW DoDI 3020.45, Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP)
   Management; DoDM 3020.45, Volume 1, Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP):
   DoD Mission-Based Critical Asset Identification Process (CAIP); DoDM 3020.45, Volume
   5, Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP): Execution Timeline, and AF

2.6. Standard 6: Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment. VA processes will be conducted per
DoDI 2000.16 or DoD O-2000.12H. VA results will be used IAW AFI 31-101 to provide a
vulnerability-based analysis of personnel (mission essential, mass gatherings, etc.), mission
essential assets (energy, infrastructure, etc.), and information susceptible to all threats and
hazards. All assessment OPRs will coordinate and conduct other wing assessments during the
Installation Vulnerability Assessment, (e.g., Food, Water, Toxic Industrial Chemicals/Toxic
Industrial Material [TIC/TIM], CBRNE and DCIP assessments) to reduce the impact on
operational units.
   2.6.1. DoD and COCOM benchmarks will be used to guide all AF VAs. The Installation’s
   IDRMP shall be used to focus VAs when evaluating the installation against DoD/COCOM
   benchmarks to ensure appropriate criticality and threat factors are considered, unless directed
   otherwise by the GCC.
   2.6.2. A VA will be conducted at least annually or as threat or mission requirements dictate.
   Installation ATOs shall report completion of their Local VA to their higher headquarters.
   Completed VA reports shall be entered into CVAMP and reviewed by the MAJCOM. VAs
   shall be conducted at a minimum for, but not limited to:
       2.6.2.1. Any AF installation or AF owned or leased facility populated daily by 300 or
       more DoD personnel.
       2.6.2.2. Any AF installation or facility bearing C2 responsibility for emergency response
       or physical security plans and programs; determined to host defense critical infrastructure
       or critical assets identified through the DCIP or AF CARM; or using, possessing,
       transferring, or receiving biological select agents and toxins (refer to DoDI 5210.89_AFI
       10-3901, Minimum Security Standards for Safeguarding Biological Select Agents and
       Toxins).
       2.6.2.3. Any AF installation, facility, or activity involving interaction with local non-
       military or host nation agencies.
       2.6.2.4. AF-hosted air ports of embarkation (POE) and debarkation (POD); movement
       routes (air, ground and rail); and assembly, staging, reception and final bed down
       locations in support of any battalion, squadron, ship, or equivalent operational
       deployment; and similar sized in-transit movement or training exercise. AF movement or
       shipment of military cargo shall be coordinated with the designated senior DoD
       Component with AT responsibility.
       2.6.2.5. Any AF personnel designated as HRP (Standard 16). These assessments are
       referred to as Personal Security Vulnerability Assessments (PSVAs). PSVAs will
       conform to the formats of servicing Protection Providing Organizations (PPO) as
       identified in DoDI O-2000.22, Designation and Physical Protection of DoD High Risk
       Personnel (HRP). AFOSI is a designated PPO.
       2.6.2.6. Any AF event or activity determined to be a special event involving a gathering
       of 300 or more DoD personnel. Consider creating a Special Events Assessment Plan or
       Template tailored for such activities.
       2.6.2.7. AF-owned or leased off-installation housing, schools, daycare centers,
       commissaries, transportation systems and routes used by DoD personnel and their
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                        25


     dependent family members when the TTL is SIGNIFICANT or higher, consistent with
     Standard 3. At locations where there are multiple DoD components or locations that are
     not AF-owned or leased, VA requirements shall be coordinated with the designated
     senior DoD Component with AT responsibility.
  2.6.3. A VA of installations or facilities with 300 personnel or more on a daily basis shall be
  conducted by a HHQ team triennially (refer to AFI 10-246 for Food and Water VA).
  2.6.4. Information derived from AT VAs shall be classified pursuant to the requirements
  outlined in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Security Classification Guide for
  Vulnerability Assessments. Information related to DCIP assets shall be classified pursuant to
  the requirements outlined in the DCIP Security Classification Guide.
  2.6.5. AT vulnerability assessments conducted by the local installation, the AF VA Team
  (AFVAT), or any other HHQ level, shall include a review of any vulnerability or concern
  identified in a previous VA (from any source/level) which remains open (i.e., not “accepted”
  or mitigated).
  2.6.6. Mitigation Plan. Within 90 days of a signed assessment report, a mitigation plan
  addressing any identified vulnerabilities will be developed and released to the first general
  officer, flag officer or civilian equivalent director in the chain of command. The mitigation
  plan shall be staffed or submitted through CVAMP and include: vulnerability identification
  and prioritization; likely threats/hazards associated with the vulnerability; impact if
  vulnerability is exploited; action plan to eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level and
  the anticipated residual risk to be accepted by the commander; estimated completion date of
  the action plan; and resources required.
  2.6.7. CVAMP shall be populated with all assessment results within 120 days of the signed
  assessment report (Neutral and Positive observations are not required to be loaded into
  CVAMP). Within 240 days of a signed assessment report, all observations must be updated
  with a plan of mitigation or closed with Commander's risk acceptance. When populating
  CVAMP, at a minimum attach a copy of the applicable VA outbrief and final report to the
  record created in CVAMP.
     2.6.7.1. HHQ shall take action (release or return) on appropriate observations within 30
     days of installation submittal.
     2.6.7.2. Installation ATOs, in conjunction with vulnerability/observation OPR or
     functional SME, will review and update CVAMP quarterly. The ATWG and ATEC will
     review open CVAMP vulnerabilities and concerns semi-annually.
     2.6.7.3. Installation Commanders may authorize Installation ATO's "Commanders
     Privileges" within CVAMP to aid in database maintenance. Such authorization will be in
     writing, and may be included on the ATO appointment letter. However, this does not
     relieve the commander from having situational awareness of the data within CVAMP.
  2.6.8. Triennial HHQ VA scheduling for AF installations or assets will be coordinated by the
  AF VAT annually. HHQ VAs will only be scheduled for the next fiscal year due to
  limitations put in place by DTRA and COCOM scheduling processes which take precedence
  over AF scheduling guidance. It is incumbent on MAJCOM ATPMs to nominate
  installations or assets that meet the criteria in para 2.6.2. through their MAJCOM IG
26                                       AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014


  Gatekeepers to the AF VAT. Nominations for the next fiscal year must be submitted to the
  AF VAT by 15 February to ensure adequate time for de-confliction and submission to DTRA
  and COCOM annual calls for nominations. Once DTRA and COCOM schedules for the next
  fiscal year are set, the AF VAT will work with the appropriate MAJCOM IG Gatekeepers
  and ATPMs to complete any HHQ VA not covered by DTRA or COCOM teams. When the
  AF VAT is available, AF VA will be conducted in conjunction with MAJCOM Phase 0
  Inspections. Since the AF VAT is a low density/high demand team, AF VA will not be
  scheduled to occur more than 6 months ahead of or behind an installation’s triennial due date
  for the sole purpose of aligning with MAJCOM inspections.
     2.6.8.1. The AF VAT scheduling process will incorporate AF CARM Critical Asset Risk
     Assessment (CARA) requirements. Where possible, AF CARAs and AF VAs will be
     aligned to assess an installation at the same time to produce a more comprehensive
     product and minimize impact on the installation.
     2.6.8.2. Once a HHQ VA schedule has been published, MAJCOMs and installations
     should make every effort to abide by the schedule. Cancellations and schedule changes
     are sometimes costly and difficult to facilitate. Cancellation request procedures for
     JSIVA will be identified in the DTRA call for nominations message. Cancellations for
     COCOM/MAJCOM HHQ VA teams will be IAW COCOM/MAJCOM guidance.
     Cancellations for AF VAs require written justification from the installation Wing
     Commander through the owning MAJCOM IG to the Commander, HQ AFSFC. The
     request should include the circumstances which require the assessment cancellation or
     schedule change and proposed alternate dates. If the AF VAT is unable to accommodate
     rescheduling the assessment, the MAJCOM is responsible for either completing the HHQ
     VA with an internal team or working with DTRA or their assigned COCOM to complete
     the assessment.
     2.6.8.3. HHQ VAs conducted by NAF or MAJCOM VA teams will be reported to the
     AF VAT for tracking and scheduling purposes. Additionally, VA Reports from these
     assessments will be provided to, and tracked by, the AFVAT.
     2.6.8.4. HHQ VAs will be considered complete when signed by the appropriate HHQ
     authority.
  2.6.9. MAJCOMs and AF Components to the GCC will support the GCCs in scheduling
  assessments and prescribing policies for no-notice or short-notice movements to locations
  where a VA has not been accomplished or is not current. MAJCOM ATPMs will receive
  copies of reports on all VAs completed based on Standard 6.
  2.6.10. Headquarters Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ AFSFC)/SFOZ (VA) shall
  provide the HAF FPWG a semi-annual vulnerability and concerns trend report based upon
  AF VAT reports. MAJCOM ATPMs shall provide units within their command a semi-
  annual vulnerability and concerns trend update based upon MAJCOM and HHQ
  Vulnerability Assessment reports. In addition, MAJCOM ATPMs shall review Installation
  CVAMP entries semi-annually.
     2.6.10.1. (Added-PACAF) IAW USPACOM OPORD 5050-08, CVAMP will be
     populated within 90 days from completion of the assessment. At a minimum, attach the
     following documents to the assessment created in CVAMP:
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                      27

         2.6.10.1.2. (Added-PACAF) A copy of the final VA report.
         2.6.10.1.3. (Added-PACAF) A signed copy of the FO/GO MAP.
         2.6.10.1.4. (Added-PACAF) At a minimum, the five key elements of the FO/GO
         MAP (Vulnerability Identification, Action Plan, ECD, Resources Required, and
         Residual Risk Identification) will be placed in the recommendation block while
         creating an observation in CVAMP.
  2.6.11. Local vulnerability assessment team composition can be tailored to the installation
  needs. The assessment team should consist of a team chief, physical security specialist,
  structural/infrastructure engineer, terrorist operations specialist, emergency management
  specialist, medical operations specialist, communications specialist and EOD specialist, when
  appropriate. Other functional experts may augment the team as needed, depending on the
  type of assessment required (comprehensive or targeted), the nature of the installation’s
  mission, and the terrorist threat level.
     2.6.11.1. (Added-PACAF) As a minimum, local vulnerability assessment (VA)
     teams will be comprised of the installation ATPM as the team chief; and functional
     experts from AFOSI, IN, SF, CE Readiness, Infrastructure and Structural Engineers,
     EOD, Communication Infrastructure Engineer, Logistics, and Medical Readiness. When
     IDRMP is used the ATO and the ATWG members will ensure that CVAMP and Force
     Pro recommended courses of action are synchronized. The installation ATO will also
     assure that all documentation of risk acceptance is consistent between CVAMP and
     IDRMP.
         2.6.11.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Local VA teams will review the installation threat by
         using, as a minimum, these baseline documents: The Worldwide Asymmetrical
         Threat to USAF Installations, Personnel and Resources Assessment, Local Threat
         Assessment, and the Installation DBT. The installation threat assessment must include
         local criminal, terrorist, and contingency threat. The term “no threat” is not
         acceptable for an installation threat assessment. Contingency threats need to be
         considered as well.
         2.6.11.1.2. (Added-PACAF) The Flag Officer/General Officer Mitigation Action
         Plan (FO/GO MAP) will include the following information as a minimum:
         2.6.11.1.3. (Added-PACAF) Vulnerability         Identification.   Description     and
         discussion of the vulnerability identified.
         2.6.11.1.4. (Added-PACAF) Action Plan. Action taken or planned to correct the
         vulnerability; describes the action required to change the existing conditions so the
         vulnerability no longer exists. If it is not eliminated completely, the consequence of
         the vulnerability being exploited is within acceptable limits.
         2.6.11.1.5. (Added-PACAF) Estimated Completion Date (ECD). Estimated date for
         completing the action plan; may include multiple ECDs when there are phases or
         more than one action required.

        2.6.11.1.7. (Added-PACAF) Residual Risk Identification. Define the amount of
        risk reduction anticipated by completing the action plan to include identification of
        risk remaining, i.e., accepted.
        2.6.11.1.8. (Added-PACAF) See Attachment 6 (Building Deviation Process
        Mitigation Process) for all deviations for USAF/DOD facilities.
        2.6.11.1.9. (Added-PACAF) All tenant organizations will be a part of the annual
        VA process.
        2.6.11.1.10. (Added-PACAF) Installations supporting OPLAN contingency
        operations must include a Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) review of
        critical operational nodes/links when conducting the VA.
  2.6.12. (Added-PACAF) VA teams will conduct the following annually:
     2.6.12.1. (Added-PACAF) Assess first responder’s capabilities per DoDI 2000.16,
     Standard 20/21.
     2.6.12.2. (Added-PACAF) Conduct a Local Water/Food Vulnerability Assessment.

     intelligence support to force protection.
  2.6.13. (Added-PACAF) Review physical security measures to protect the installation,
  resources, and personnel.
     2.6.13.1. (Added-PACAF) Vehicle inspections for large commercial vehicles are a vital
     piece of an installations physical security measures to deter explosives from being
     introduced to an installation. As a minimum, the inspection will include a check of the
     interior, exterior, under carriage, engine compartment, and all interior storage bays of the
     vehicle. What constitutes a large commercial vehicle will be defined by the installation
     ATWG and approved by the installation commander.
     2.6.13.2. (Added-PACAF) Review threat and terrorist incident response, WMD, and
     CBRNE (toxic industrial chemicals/materials).
     2.6.13.3. (Added-PACAF) Review written plans to ensure they identify the most

2.7. Standard 7: AT Plan.
   2.7.1. Installation Commanders will develop and maintain a comprehensive AT plan for all
   elements and personnel for which the AF has AT responsibility. Installation AT plans must
   be cross-referenced, compatible, and synchronized with other base plans (IDP, CEMP,
   MCRP, etc.). AT plans will not be considered complete unless signed by the commander and
   exercised. At a minimum, AT plans shall be developed for the installation (integrating
   separate/leased facilities), for AF operational deployments, training exercise deployments or
   events, and special events.
      2.7.1.1. Installation AT plans will specify requirements for unit AT plans and programs.
      Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve (AFR) tenant units will be integrated
      into host installation AT plans, and are not required to write their own. However, they
      will develop an AT plan or instruction for their unit detailing unit procedures based on
      the host installation’s AT plan. ANG and AFR tenant units will appoint an ATR for each
      unit and will participate fully in the host installation’s AT program.
          2.7.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Alaska installations follow USNORTHCOM AT
          guidance as USNORTHCOM has TACON for FP and must also adhere to this AFI.
      2.7.1.2. Installation Commanders will review and sign AT plans within 60 days of taking
      command.
   2.7.2. AT principles are incorporated into all operational plans and risk decisions using the
   standards prescribed by this instruction as a baseline to develop and implement AT policies
   in support of the AF’s unique roles and mission requirements. Table 2.1. incorporates
   Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 8, National Preparedness. The OPR will recommend the
   appropriate planning parameters regarding the scale for AF operations and civil support
   operations based on the threat. Where A7C (CE) is designated the OPR, refer to AFI 10-
   2501.

     2.7.3. Tailor AT plans to the level of command or activity for which the AT principles were
     developed. AT plans should reference (not copy) information in other base plans. At a
     minimum AT plans shall address:
        2.7.3.1. The minimum essential AT program elements (AT Standard 1) and standards
        prescribed by this instruction to include:
        2.7.3.2. Risk correction or mitigation measures to establish a local baseline defensive
        posture. The local baseline defensive posture shall facilitate systematic movement to and
        from elevated security postures, including the application of RAMs.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                         31


     2.7.3.3. AT physical security measures (Standard 13). These measures, to include the
     barrier plan, will be contained within the IDP and referenced in the AT plan.
     2.7.3.4. AT risk mitigation measures for AF off-installation facilities, housing and
     activities (Standard 15).
     2.7.3.5. AT risk mitigation measures for HRP (Standard 16).

     2.7.3.11. Terrorism consequence management measures, including CBRNE mitigation
     planning (Standard 21 and CEMP 10-2).
     2.7.3.12. FPCON implementation measures, including site-specific AT measures
     (Standard 22).
  2.7.4. AT planning information (e.g., airfield, port, and movement route information and
  criticality, threat, and VA data) for deploying DoD units may be provided by GCCs. GCCs
  may also direct the execution of advance site surveys to facilitate the AT planning process in
  areas where the assessed TTL is SIGNIFICANT or HIGH or where a specific terrorism
  warning is in effect.
     2.7.4.1. At the discretion of the GCC, such security efforts may be waived for
     deployments or visits to controlled locations such as existing military installations.
     2.7.4.2. Augmentation of assessment personnel may be necessary to enable subordinate
     AF Component commanders to discharge their responsibility to provide security, surveys,
     assessments, CI and countersurveillance support, and to act as the liaison with the
     country team, host nation security force, contractors and port authority.
  2.7.5. In countries where available, AFOSI special agents are assigned to FP Detachments
  (FPD) and provide FP and CI services to in-transit DoD personnel. FPDs are mandated to
  provide surveys, assessments, CI and countersurveillance support, and act as the liaison with
  the country team, host nation security forces, contractors and port authority.
  2.7.6. Coordinate AFOSI support for large exercises, contingencies and special events in
  foreign countries.
  2.7.7. Ensure plans include procedures to expedite responding off-base (civilian and
  military) first and emergency responders onto the installation during emergencies, under all
  FPCONs.
     2.7.7.1. (Added-PACAF) AF personnel taking part in an operational tasking or event
     (e.g., air shows, exercises, deployments) off a U.S. installation must have an approved
     AT Plan in accordance with USPACOM OPORD 5050-08. Travel trackers are required
     for all DoD personnel traveling or deploying to countries or areas within the USPACOM
     AOR that are not a part of the U.S., its territories, or possessions. DoD civilians,

      contractors and family members must abide by USPACOM AT policies and procedures
      when working and/or traveling in an official capacity in the USPACOM AOR. Upon
      USPACOM implementation of the Individual Antiterrorism Travel Plan (IATP/TT) in
      May 2010, all PACAF personnel will use this mandated computer-based way of
      submitting Travel Plans. The IATP is completed for Travel Restricted Countries and
      must be reviewed/endorsed by an ATO Coordinator/Endorser in the traveler’s chain of
      command before being forwarded to the approving FOGO in the chain. The Travel
      Tracker (required for Non-Travel Restricted Countries) does not require any
      coordination/approval and by submission alone fulfills the USPACOM requirement.
      2.7.7.2. (Added-PACAF) When there is no COMAFFOR, deployed commander, etc.,
      and the owning Wing Commander of the assets does not accept the minimum security
      requirements for the event , then the plan will be submitted through the PACAF/TWG to
      13 EAF/CC for approval. Note: For JCS-sponsored exercises and associated planning
      events, the executive agent for the exercise will develop and submit the AT Plan for all
      participating U.S. forces. Templates for consideration are included in USPACOM
      OPORD 5050-08, E-1-1. If there is an assigned AEW/CC per the DEPORD then they
      have risk acceptance authority for security of assets and personnel.
   2.7.8. (Added-PACAF) Deployment AT Plans will use the established format established
   by the GCC of the region to which the unit is deploying plus the following additional
   PACAF requirements:
      2.7.8.1. (Added-PACAF) Details of how the deployed commander will ensure host
      nation or non-USAF augmentation will protect the commander’s resources, personnel
      and sensitive or classified information from the postulated threat.
      2.7.8.2. (Added-PACAF) Communication plans between augmentation forces where
      interaction is transparent during contingencies/exercises.
      2.7.8.3. (Added-PACAF) Flow of time sensitive threat information and threat warnings
      between augmentation forces, host nation security, and AF security forces personnel.
      2.7.8.4. (Added-PACAF) Contingency plans for any likely events that may endanger
      U.S. personnel, resources or information.
      2.7.8.5. (Added-PACAF) The logistics contracting process for support of operational
      forces must incorporate consideration for AT measures during the contracting process,
      award, execution, and evaluation process. This must take place for in-transit and
      supporting forces.
      2.7.8.6. (Added-PACAF) Joint Base installations where another Component has the
      lead will ensure USAF mission and personnel are covered in the host installation AT Plan
      (e.g., JBPH-H). The USAF ATO will write an annex to the Navy AT Plan to cover USAF
      assets and personnel, or complete a stand-alone AT plan for supported USAF units.
2.8. Standard 8: AT Program Coordination.
   2.8.1. GCCs coordinate AT and security matters with the appropriate CoM and host nation
   authorities for countries within their AOR and with the heads of the other DoD Components
   whose personnel are stationed in or transit the respective GCC AOR.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                           33


  2.8.2. AF Component commanders of personnel who will be stationed in or transit the AOR
  of a GCC shall:
     2.8.2.1. Initiate coordination of AT matters with the appropriate GCC pursuant to the
     requirements established by DoDI 2000.12.
         2.8.2.1.1. The senior deployed commander with AT responsibility will designate an
         ATO in writing to coordinate with the AF Component to the GCC and provide this
         information through the Unit Deployment Centers with Unit Type Codes (UTCs)
         assigned for the deployment.
         2.8.2.1.2. AF elements of in-transit forces with less than 300 personnel and not
         deploying as a larger troop movement will comply with the GCC operation order
         (OPORD) and file an in-transit AT plan with their ATO and commander for approval.
         This requirement will typically apply to troop movements of 50 or more personnel;
         however, commanders may lower this threshold at their discretion based on threat or
         other considerations. Coordinate with MAJCOMs or GCCs to determine additional
         in-transit AT plan filing requirements. The plan will cover travel from permanent
         station to the initial assembly or embarkation point, where it becomes the
         responsibility of the senior officer of a larger movement, such as a troop commander.
         If the movement does not join a larger force where AT responsibility is transferred,
         the AT plan must include transit to the deployed location where a commander is
         designated as having AT responsibility by orders.
         2.8.2.1.3. For countries where the AF will be performing temporary duty,
         commanders will immediately contact the AFOSI unit or ATO responsible for that
         AOR. AFOSI will provide a specific, tailored threat briefing prior to departure.
     2.8.2.2. Coordinate AT matters with local, State, Federal, Tribal, and/or host nation
     authorities pursuant to existing law, AF and DoD policy to support AT planning and
     implementation. Where support agreements such as MOUs, MOAs or MAA are needed
     to support the AT program, ensure they are reviewed annually by the ATWG for
     currency and executability, and exercised annually (all parties to the agreement should
     participate in at least one exercise annually).
  2.8.3. All tenant units, DoD elements, and privatized support to AF property and activities
  shall coordinate AT program and plan requirements with the host installation commander or
  civilian equivalent director. Tenant units, DoD elements, support activities, and separate
  facilities shall participate fully in the host installation’s AT program, to include participation
  in AT exercises. At locations where there are multiple DoD components, such as DoD-
  leased facilities or other facilities where DoD occupies space, the designated senior DoD
  Component, unless otherwise stipulated by the applicable GCC, shall be responsible for
  integrating and coordinating individual DoD component security plans into a comprehensive
  installation, separate facility or area-wide AT program.
     2.8.3.1. (Added-PACAF) AT Travel Plans are required for all DoD personnel traveling
     or deploying to countries or areas within the USPACOM AOR that are not a part of the
     U.S., its territories, or possessions. DoD civilians, contractors and family members must
     abide by USPACOM AT policies and procedures when working and/or traveling in an
     official capacity in the USPACOM AOR.

          2.8.3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Travel restrictions and AT Travel Plans are not required
          for civilians and family members on unofficial travel (e.g., leave) although they are
          highly encouraged to follow these procedures and policies for their own safety and
          security.
          2.8.3.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Personnel deploying outside of the USPACOM AOR
          into another GCC AOR must follow the specific AT guidelines set forth by that
          Combatant Commander.
          2.8.3.1.3. (Added-PACAF) Approving authority for AT Travel Plans is as follows:
          2.8.3.1.4. (Added-PACAF) Travel to USPACOM travel restricted areas requires the
          approval of the first O-7 in the chain of command. If applicable, a civilian Senior
          Executive Service (SES) or equivalent exercising authority satisfies this requirement
          for travel restricted areas.
          2.8.3.1.5. (Added-PACAF) Permission to travel to USPACOM travel restricted
          areas can only be granted by USPACOM/J3 and only for mission essential travel.
          Refer to USPACOM/J34 NIPRNET website for the latest listing of travel-restricted
          countries.
          2.8.3.1.6. (Added-PACAF) Requests must be endorsed and processed through the
          traveler’s chain of command.

          travel request through the Aircraft and Personnel Automated Clearance System
          (APACS). https://apacs.dtic.mil/apacs/apacsservlet?cmd=apacsLogin
2.9. Standard 9: AT Officer (ATO).
   2.9.1. Commanders will designate, in writing, a Level II-qualified commissioned officer,
   non-commissioned officer, or civilian staff officer as the ATO (see Standard 26 for criteria).
   The ATO is the commander’s military or civilian advisor charged with managing the AT
   Program (contractors may not be appointed as primary or alternate ATO for government
   facilities). The ATO advisory role does not replace a functional manager’s or commander’s
   responsibility to execute programs in support of the operational commander’s mission.
   ATOs shall be assigned to:
      2.9.1.1. Installation and separate facility (those not supported by a host installation AT
      Program) or higher levels.
      2.9.1.2. Units having 300 or more personnel assigned or under the operational control of
      a designated commander will have a Level II-certified ATO.

     2.9.2.5. Collaborate with the TWG to determine if action through warnings, policy &
     guidance, or organize, train and equip functions are necessary based on worldwide
     terrorism incidents or threats. The ANG collaborates with the NGB/J34 TWG to
     determine if action through warnings, policy & guidance, or organize, train and equip
     functions are necessary based on worldwide terrorism incidents or threats.
     2.9.2.6. Work closely with AFOSI and Security Forces to support and advocate the Air
     Force Eagle Eyes program.
     2.9.2.7. Participate in installation working groups such as the IDWG, ATWG, TWG,
     EMWG, CARMWG, Facilities Board, and Medical working groups as necessary.
  2.9.3. The following are the requirements and responsibilities for installation and wing-level
  (and higher) ATOs:
     2.9.3.1. The minimum grade of these ATOs shall be O-3, E-7, GS-12 or equivalent. At
     units or deployed locations where the rank requirements cannot be met, the priority for
     selecting an ATO should be based on AT expertise and certification. In order to
     effectively coordinate on threat data with AFOSI and A2 Force Protection Intelligence
     (FPI) representatives, the Installation ATO requires appropriate clearance and access to
     Top Secret (TS), Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), and Human Intelligence
     (HUMINT) Control System (HCS) and Gamma (G) data. Individuals requiring these
     clearances will work through their unit and MAJCOM A1 to change their Unit Manning
     Document (UMD) position(s) to reflect the needed clearances.
     2.9.3.2. Installation ATOs will be assigned to the commander’s immediate staff for
     access to the commander or a senior officer on the commander’s immediate staff.
     2.9.3.2. (PACAF) Installation ATOs previously in the Wing Chain will be assigned to
     the DFC’s immediate staff and reside in the S5 shop. The ATPM assigned to the DFC
     should not assume any other duties and responsibilities other than management of the AT
     Program or as directed in a fourth-coming HAF approved PD for their position.
         2.9.3.2.1. (Added-PACAF) The ATO will form a Vulnerability Mitigation Working
         Group (VMWG) where all vulnerabilities will be addressed and tracked until they are
36                                      AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014


        mitigated and/or closed. The installation ATWG or key members of this WG can be
        used in this capacity.
            2.9.3.2.1.1. (Added-PACAF) All programmatic vulnerabilities must have a
            funding request (UFR, CbTRIF or CCIF) in CVAMP. Coordinate cost analysis,
            estimates, etc., through Subject Matter Experts (SME) and/or functional
            representatives who are the office of primary responsibility (OPR) or office of
            collateral responsibility (OCR).
            2.9.3.2.1.2. (Added-PACAF) All funding requests must be reviewed quarterly
            and updated within CVAMP. Projects must be fiscally executable by end-of-year.
     2.9.3.3. Ensure CVAMP is populated with all observations from assessments and
     program review reports IAW this instruction. Additional functional databases may be
     used for follow-on project information and tracking, but a reference note must be
     documented in the vulnerability observation within CVAMP. Coordinate with functional
     commanders to ensure AT-related observations (vulnerabilities and concerns) are entered
     in, and decisions or actions are tracked in, CVAMP.
     2.9.3.4. Ensure CVAMP is used to identify and track AT resourcing actions and
     appropriate vulnerabilities are submitted to the owning MAJCOM or HHQ for AT
     funding assistance.     Where emergency or newly-emergent requirements occur,
     recommend and document requests/concerns for CCIF funding IAW para 2.9.2.3. of this
     publication.
        2.9.3.4.1. (Added-PACAF) Recommend Unfunded Requests (UFR), Combating
        Terrorism Readiness Initiative Fund (CbTRIF) and Combatant Commander Initiative
        Fund (CCIF) submissions. Note:         CCIF is another potential source of funding
        available to Combatant Commanders. The primary focus of CCIF, as detailed in
        CJCSI 7401.01B, is to support unforeseen contingency requirements critical to the
        combatant command’s joint war fighting readiness and national security interests.
        The strongest candidates for approval are initiatives that support combatant command
        activities and functions, enhance interoperability and yield high benefit at low cost.
        Refer to USPACOM OPORD 5050-08 Annex N for further guidance.
        2.9.3.4.2. (Added-PACAF) Unless otherwise specified by HQ PACAF/A7S,
        PACAF installations will forward UFR, CbTRIF and CCIF requests to NAFs and or
        HQ PACAF/A7S branches bi-annually. The commander has the option to use unit
        Operations and Maintenance funding at his/her discretion depending on the necessity
        of correcting/mitigating the vulnerability. Additional funds must be programmed
        accordingly through the DoD Planning, Programming and Budgeting System
        (PPBS). Note: Installations in Korea and Alaska will submit requests direct to either
        USFK or AFNORTH respectively. USFK and PACAF will review, edit and prioritize
        submitted packages prior to final submittal to USPACOM.
        2.9.3.4.3. (Added-PACAF) Within 90 days of a completed assessment, the
        ATO will ensure a MAP to mitigate or eliminate vulnerabilities is forwarded to the
        first FO/GO in the chain of command.
            2.9.3.4.3.1. (Added-PACAF) A signed copy of the approved FO/GO letter will
            be sent to HQ PACAF/A7SA and electronically attached to the assessment in
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                       37

     appointed for all air shows, exercises and deployments. The ATO attends all planning
     conferences as directed by USPACOM OPORD 5050-08. If budget restrictions prohibit
     attendance, PACAF/A7S and A3Y will determine at the Division Chief level and
     USPACOM waiver will be considered. When deemed necessary, HQ PACAF/A7S will
     send a representative to the initial planning conference for additional guidance/assistance
     to the ATO and host nation. An airfield assessment will be completed or validated during
     the initial planning conference if held at the exercise, air show or deployed location. The
     completed assessments will be forwarded to HQ PACAF/A7S for publication on shared
     web-sites. PACAF/A7S will determine when events can have different personnel
     attending IPCs, MPCs, Exercises, Air Shows based upon the ATOs individual experience
     for those events.
     2.9.4.8. (Added-PACAF) All PACAF installations, NAFs and GSUs will designate, in
     writing, a primary and alternate ATO/ATPM as applicable and forward a copy of the

      decisions, discussions and activities.
      2.10.1.2. Maintain a minimum of the last 12 months of meeting minutes on file.
      Coordinate with other working groups as appropriate to eliminate redundant
      records/efforts. Units will ensure they allow for local Table and Rule within their
      respective file plans and maintain this reference data for unit continuity and action as
      required.
   2.10.2. The chairperson for the ATWG will be designated by the Installation Commander.
   The ATWG is usually composed of the ATO, DFC, CARM Manager, Intelligence, AFOSI,
   and Emergency Management. Consider including other functional level expertise and
   appropriate representation from external Law Enforcement agencies and the Intelligence
   Community as needed. The chair and mandatory members of the ATWG will be designated
   in writing by the installation commander. Security clearance requirements for members also
   will be established by the installation commander.
   2.10.3. At the HAF level, the ATWG is combined with the Force Protection Working Group
   (FPWG). AF/A7SO chairs the HAF FPWG. The HAF FPWG is an action officer-level
   group, meeting semi-annually, or more frequently as needed, to work FP issues as directed
   by the HAF FP Steering Group, and to coordinate and integrate Force Protection efforts
   among the members, to include AT efforts. Similar procedures should be implemented at the
   MAJCOM level.
      2.10.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Installations should consider appointing the DFC or ATPM
      as the chairperson.
   2.10.4. (Added-PACAF) PACAF subordinate agencies will integrate identical or similar
   functions into their local or installation threat mitigation processes to adequately address
   MAJCOM directed guidance or recommendations.
2.11. Standard 11: Threat Working Group (TWG).
   2.11.1. A multi-functional TWG shall be established at AF installations, self supported
   separate facilities, and higher headquarters which meets as needed to analyze and counter an
   emergent threat. The TWG is required to meet at least quarterly or more frequently,
40                                        AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014


  depending upon the threat activity. The TWG should be activated at least semiannually in
  response to Wing level Antiterrorism exercises. TWGs develop and refine terrorism threat
  assessments and coordinate and disseminate threat warnings, reports, and summaries.
  2.11.2. The TWG will be chaired by the installation commander (or a designated
  representative) and is composed of the DFC, ATO, Intelligence, AFOSI, Security Forces (S2)
  (identified in AFI 38-101), Public Affairs, and Legal (additional membership can be added
  based on the threat). Security clearance requirements for members will be established by the
  commander.
  2.11.3. The Information Fusion Cell (IFC) as identified in AFI 31-101 may be leveraged to
  fill threat information gaps in order to facilitate the COA development process.
     2.11.3.1. (Added-PACAF) The installation commander will designate the TWG
     chairperson in writing. Installations should consider having their respective TWG
     chaired by the senior member of the local intelligence squadron or Intelligence Officer.
     The installation chairperson will organize and facilitate TWG meetings. Primary
     membership of the installation TWG will include the ATO, senior representatives from
     OSI, IN, SF, OG and CE, and local agencies as required. Invite, as adjunct membership,
     host nation, civilian Law Enforcement, FBI, joint and/or combined forces representatives
     to attend the installation TWG as required. During TWG meetings attended by outside
     agencies, ensure classified information is not discussed unless local agencies have
     been cleared for classified. Installation TWGs should consult their local Information
     Protection Offices (IPO) for further guidance.
     2.11.3.2. (Added-PACAF) Based on threat information, appropriate SMEs shall be
     assembled to provide information needed to develop predictive intelligence and
     recommend COA to counter threats or otherwise reduce risk. If resources are available,
     especially at high threat locations or at MAJCOM or higher levels, members of the TWG
     may be further organized to form the basis of an Intelligence Fusion Cell as described in
     AFTTP 3-10.2, Integrated Base Defense Command and Control.
     2.11.3.3. (Added-PACAF) Installation TWGs will monitor the DoD Terrorism Threat
     Levels for each country in which they have personnel deployed. The Terrorism Threat
     Levels are posted on both the USPACOM and PACAF SIPRNET websites. Installations,
     NAFs, subordinate units will use the DoD Terrorism Threat Level System listed in DOD
     2000.16 Standard 2 and USPACOM OPORD 5050-08 Appendix 2 to Annex C .3.b.1.
     http://psp.hq.pacom.smil.mil
  2.11.4. (Added-PACAF) PACAF, NAF and wing intelligence squadrons/detachments
  (Intel and/or OSI) will provide all-source threat information and analysis to the installation
  TWG and Intelligence Fusion Cell (IFC), staffs and units within their commands and
  attached tenant units. Intelligence and OSI personnel must coordinate intelligence
  information to ensure a full spectrum threat picture is presented to the installation TWG and
  ATWG. Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRS) can be requested directly from each
  installation Intelligence Unit office as they come through secure channels into HQ
  PACAF/A2.
  2.11.5. (Added-PACAF) The purpose of Blue Dart is to pass time-sensitive threat warning
  information from the information collector to the threatened US unit/person in the PACOM
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                        41


   AOR. Refer to USPACOM OPORD 5050-08, for specific procedures in disseminating Blue
   Dart threat information. In addition to USPACOM Blue Dart exercises, the PACAF/TWG
   may conduct no-notice Blue Dart exercises as directed by COMPACAF or designated
   representative. Alaska bases refer to USNORTHCOM AT OPORD.
   2.11.6. (Added-PACAF) HQ PACAF, NAFs and Installation Commanders will establish
   TWGs. If NAFs elect to participate in the tenant wing’s TWG or HHQ TWG, they are not
   required to establish a separate TWG. The host installation TWG will remain responsive to
   NAF’s threat information requirements. Installation TWG and ATWG components must
   communicate on a frequent basis so that local commanders and operators are aware of threat
   intelligence and possible mitigation measures in a timely manner. Additionally, installation
   TWGs must forward locally derived threat information and planned FP measures to the
   PACAF/ATWG as soon as possible when changes are planned or executed. PACAF in turn
   has a responsibility to brief senior leadership on these changes and this is completed through
   the TWG process.
      2.11.6.1. (Added-PACAF) Defense Terrorism Warning Reports are handled through
      AIG messages via the PACAF Command Center EA Cell. Any reports pertaining to
      PACAF installations will be assessed by the TWG and recommendations made to the
      ATWG for mitigating measures.
      2.11.6.2. (Added-PACAF) The installation TWG will:
          2.11.6.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Distribute pertinent threat information to the affected
          unit.
          2.11.6.2.2. (Added-PACAF) Analyze information to determine if they can be linked
          to other reports and make any recommendations to the ATWG for potential
          mitigating measures.
2.12. Standard 12: AT Executive Committee (ATEC).
   2.12.1. An AT executive-level committee will be established at AF installations, self
   supported separate facilities, and higher headquarters that meets at least semi annually or as
   directed by the commander (i.e., emerging threats, IDRMP, etc.). The goal of the ATEC is to
   develop and refine AT program guidance, policy and standards; act upon recommendations
   of the ATWG; and determine resource allocation priorities to mitigate or eliminate terrorism-
   related vulnerabilities.
   2.12.2. The ATEC will be chaired by the installation commander (or a designated
   representative) and is composed of the group commanders (or designated representatives),
   and is supported by the ATO, DFC, Intelligence, AFOSI, Security Forces (S2),
   Communications, Information Protection, Emergency Management, Critical Infrastructure,
   EOD, Logistics Readiness, Medical Readiness, Public Affairs, Legal, Air Field Operations,
   Financial Management, major tenants, and supported Components on a Joint Base consistent
   with parent Service directives and local MOUs. The chair and mandatory members of the
   ATEC will be designated in writing. Security clearance requirements for members will be
   established by the commander.
   2.12.3. On AF installations and self supported separate facilities, the ATEC should be
   combined with the IDC. Ensure meeting minutes accurately identify which decisions and
 42                                         AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014


   areas of discussion are related to the installation AT program. Maintain at least the past 12
   months of meeting minutes on file. Coordinate with other working groups to eliminate
   redundant records/efforts. Units will ensure they allow for local Table and Rule within their
   respective file plans to maintain this reference data for unit continuity and action as required.
   The ATEC will conduct a semi-annual review of all AT deviations, local FPCON measures,
   Installation Risk Assessments, open CVAMP observations, Wing AT plan and Wing RAM
   execution.
   2.12.4. At the Headquarters Air Force level, the ATEC shall be constituted within the HAF
   FPSG. AF/A7S chairs the HAF FP Steering Group. The HAF FPSG is a multi-discipline
   body at the general officer/senior executive service-level, chartered to meet at least semi
   annually to improve doctrine, policy, tactics, techniques and procedures for FP operations.
   This structure may be mirrored at the MAJCOM level.
2.13. Standard 13: AT Physical Security Measures.
   2.13.1. Principles of AFI 31-101, DoD 5200.08-R, Physical Security Program, and
   Antiterrorism Handbook, are applied and fully integrated into AT plans to ensure
   employment of a holistic security system to counter terrorist capabilities. Well-designed
   physical security measures are multi-layered and include the integration and synchronization
   of the essential elements of detection, assessment, delay or denial, communication and
   response. The development of comprehensive physical security measures requires the
   integration of facilities, physical security equipment, trained personnel, biometrics entry
   control equipment, procedures oriented at a minimum in support of perimeter and area
   security, access and egress control, protection against CBRNE attacks (including those using
   the postal system and food/water supplies), HRP protection, barrier plans, and facility
   standoff distances.
   2.13.2. Tenant unit security plans and measures, to include those of non-USAF elements,
   shall be coordinated and integrated into the host installation IDP and referenced in the AT
   plan.
   2.13.3. Security Forces employing Explosive Detection Equipment (EDE) must be trained
   on employment of EDE and ensure sufficient consumables are maintained to allow random
   or spot inspections.
      2.13.3.1. The Navy has been designated as DoD lead for the Explosive Detection
      Equipment        RDT&E         Program. Reports     can       be     accessed     at:
      https://www.us.army.mil/suite/folder/9892268. Must register for an AKO account first,
      then ask for privileges to folder.
   2.13.4. Ensure installation access control points and associated barrier plans are constructed
   and operated IAW the Antiterrorism Handbook; UFC 4-022-01, Security Engineering: Entry
   Control Facility/Access Control Points; DTM 09-012, Interim Policy Guidance for DoD
   Physical Access Control; and AFI 31-113, Installation Perimeter Access Control.
      2.13.4.1. Installations will enforce proper standoff by employing UFC 4-010-01 and
      Antiterrorism Handbook recommended barriers. Where there is a threat from a moving
      vehicle and continuous operation is mission essential, or the occupants cannot be
      evacuated, the type of barrier chosen must prevent a moving vehicle from encroaching
      into the standoff area.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                          43


       2.13.4.2. Barrier plans also identify responsibility for executing the barrier plan and
       establish timelines for implementation.
2.14. Standard 14: Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAM).
   2.14.1. The RAM program is developed and implemented as an integral component of the
   overall AT program and guided by the principles outlined in the Antiterrorism Handbook.
   To maximize the effectiveness and deterrence value, RAMs should be developed to counter
   risk from threats identified in the installation Threat Assessment, and implemented without a
   set pattern, either in terms of the measure selected, time, place or other variables. Lessons
   learned have highlighted unpredictability in security activities as one of the best and most
   cost effective deterrents available to a commander. Randomly changing AT measures enable
   integrated defenses to appear formidable and prevent threats from easily discerning and
   predicting patterns or routines that are vulnerable to attack. RAMs, at a minimum, shall
   consist of the random implementation of higher FPCON measures, to include MAJCOM or
   locally developed site-specific measures. Random use of other security measures, to include
   technologies, should be used to supplement FPCON measures. The RAM program shall be
   included in AT plans.
   2.14.2. When developing and implementing an effective installation RAM program:
       2.14.2.1. Include tenant units and organizations.
       2.14.2.2. Implement daily RAMs to include weekends and holidays. The frequency will
       be increased as the threat increases. At least three RAMs chosen from higher FPCONs
       are required daily.
       2.14.2.3. Consider implementing RAMs to mitigate and reduce risk for existing
       vulnerabilities.
       2.14.2.4. RAM implementation shall be compatible and coordinated with ongoing law
       enforcement or CI surveillance detection and ID measures. When random vehicle
       inspections (RVI) are employed as a RAM, ensure pre-coordination with the installation
       legal office. Follow existing law enforcement rules when employing RVIs as a RAM.
       2.14.2.5. Consider methods to make RAMs visible in order to confuse or expose enemy
       surveillance attempts and preoperational planning.
       2.14.2.6. Make efforts to include local, State, Federal and host nation law enforcement
       patrols and first responders, as appropriate.
       2.14.2.7. Implement RAMs installation-wide or focused on facilities or functions
       identified as potential targets. When implementing facility-specific RAMs, consider the
       possibility increased security on a particular building may signal its importance.
       2.14.2.8. Installation RAM implementation efforts shall be monitored, tracked and
       analyzed by the installation ATO. Effectiveness of RAMs should be measured by the
       ATO and analyzed by the TWG.
2.15. Standard 15: AT Measures for AF Off-Installation Facilities, Housing and Activities.
   2.15.1. Installations shall include specific AT measures for AF-owned or leased off-
   installation facilities, housing, transportation services, daycare centers, and other activities
   used by or involving a mass-gathering of DoD personnel and/or their dependent family
 44                                          AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014


   members in their overall AT programs. At locations where there are multiple DoD
   components or locations, AT measures shall be coordinated with the designated senior DoD
   Component with AT responsibility.
   2.15.2. Risk mitigation measures for AF-owned or leased off-installation facilities, housing
   and activities shall include, but are not limited to: emergency notification and recall
   procedures, guidance for selection of off-installation housing, temporary billeting and other
   facility use (including compliance with UFC 4-010-01 for leased, newly-constructed and
   expeditionary buildings), physical security measures, CBRNE defensive measures and
   shelter-in-place (ensure consistency and interoperability with CEMP 10-2), and relocation
   and evacuation procedures.
   2.15.3. Develop appropriate support agreements (e.g., MOU, MOA, MAA) with appropriate
   federal, state, local, or tribal/host nation authorities to coordinate security measures, response
   capabilities, and assistance requirements.
      2.15.3.1. Ensure such agreements are reviewed annually by the OPR, ATWG and JA for
      currency and executability. They should be exercised annually and all parties to the
      agreement should participate in at least one exercise annually.
      2.15.3.2. It is the specific responsibility of the support agreement OPR to coordinate the
      support agreement and ensure one copy is filed with the installation office of primary
      responsibility for support agreements.
      2.15.3.3. (Added-PACAF) A security contingency plan needs to be addressed in the
      Installation AT Plan for personnel residing off-installation in countries where the
      Terrorism Threat Level is significant or higher when residing outside of the U.S.
2.16. Standard 16: AT Measures for High-Risk Personnel (HRP).

      2.16.1.2. AFOSI is designated as the AF lead Protection Providing Organization (PPO)
      and is the AF lead for Protective Service Details (PSD) and PSVAs IAW AFI 71-101,
      Volume 2.
   2.16.2. Designation of positions as High-Risk Billets (HRB) and HRP shall be IAW DoDI
   O-2000.22 and AFI 71-101, Volume 2.
      2.16.2.1. SAF/IGX shall staff nomination packages for the Secretary of the Air Force
      (SecAF), who will make the decision to nominate AF officials to the Office of the
      Secretary of Defense (OSD).
      2.16.2.2. SAF/AA shall staff nomination packages for the AF Top-4, as appropriate.
      2.16.2.3. Nomination packages shall be staffed through the appropriate MAJCOM or AF
      Component to a GCC.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                       45


          2.16.2.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Recommendations for nomination of individual
          personnel as High Risk Personnel (HRP) will be vetted through the PACAF/TWG.
          HQ PACAF/A7S will coordinate the suggested change with USPACOM/J34 and all
          recommended changes will be completed IAW DODI O-2000.22 and AFI 71-101,Vol
          2.
   2.16.3. AFOSI will complete a PSVA for each person occupying an HRB who is nominated
   for HRP IAW DoDI O-2000.22 and AFI 71-101, Volume 2. PSVAs will be initiated within
   90 days of an individual’s assignment to a HRB and nomination for HRP. PSVAs will be
   revalidated annually and updated if the TTL changes, but no less than every 3 years.
   2.16.4. HRP and family members, as appropriate, shall complete appropriate AFOSI-
   sponsored HRP training (i.e., personal protection, evasive driving, AT awareness and hostage
   survival); shall be properly cleared for assignment to positions, facilities or countries
   requiring such protection; and shall be thoroughly indoctrinated on the duties and
   responsibilities of protective service personnel.
   2.16.5. HRP designees and their family members shall be familiar with treaty, statutory,
   policy, regulatory and local constraints on the application of supplemental security measures
   for certain high-ranking DoD officials who are provided additional protection due to their
   position.
   2.16.6. HRP security measures shall be reviewed within 60 days of changes to the TTL for
   the affected country and HRP.
   2.16.7. The provisions of AFI 23-302, Vehicle Management, shall be complied with for the
   acquisition and use of non-tactical armored vehicles.
   2.16.8. Use UFC 4-010-03, Physical Security Measure for High-Risk Personnel, in
   conjunction with a PSVA when available. When a PSVA is not available, this document may
   also be used as selection criteria for a HRP residence or office. UFC 4-010-03 provides
   planning and design guidance for construction, renovation, and leases associated with the
   primary residence or office of a HRP. However, these criteria are not intended for HRP
   protection in combat zones and in areas where contingency or expeditionary operations are
   underway.
2.17. Standard 17: AT Construction and Building Considerations.
   2.17.1. AT construction standards apply to all DoD Components, to all DoD inhabited
   buildings, billeting, and high occupancy family housing and to all DoD expeditionary and
   temporary structures in accordance with UFC 4-010-01. Attachment 6 provides guidance on
   requesting a UFC AT standards deviation.
   2.17.2. Refer to UFC 4-010-01, AFPD 31-1, AFI 31-101, AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget
   Guidance and Procedures, and AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements, for additional
   information. Proper facility project planning, programming and design must be done in
   concert with the ATO, installation intelligence and security personnel to adequately address
   site specific threats.
   2.17.3. The installation commander or the senior Civil Engineer on the commander’s behalf
   will certify that new facilities, or renovation projects where the UFC has been triggered,
   comply with UFC AT standards.
 46                                        AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014


   2.17.4. Engineering staff will work with the ATO from design inception to project
   completion, to ensure AT requirements are met. The ATO shall be part of the coordination
   process prior to certification.
   2.17.5. Ensure the A7C (CE) and ATO develop a prioritized list of risk mitigation measures
   (reference DoD O-2000.12-H, UFCs and AFI 31-101) for use by site selection teams. These
   criteria shall be used to determine if facilities either currently occupied or being considered
   for occupancy provide adequate protection for DoD personnel against the effects of a
   terrorist attack. Circumstances may require the movement of DoD personnel or assets to
   facilities the U.S. Government had not previously used or surveyed. AT Standards shall be a
   key consideration in evaluating the suitability of facilities that were previously not used or
   surveyed.
   2.17.6. The A7C (CE) will ensure at least one engineer at each installation has completed the
   Security Engineering and Design Course to review, document and track construction projects
   for compliance with UFCs and AT Standards. Take into consideration retention and
   competence of personnel. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) security engineering
   course and the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) Antiterrorism/Security
   Engineering Workshop fulfills this requirement.
      2.17.6.1. (Added-PACAF) The ATO and the CE subject matter expert will review all
      installation construction or renovation projects to ensure they meet UFC 4-010-01and all
      other UFC requirements. This review will include initial project design to final project
      completion.
2.18. Standard 18: AT Measures for Logistics and Other Contracting.
   2.18.1. AT measures shall be incorporated into the logistics and contracting processes
   (requirements development, vendor selection, award, execution and evaluation) when the
   provisions of the contract or services provided affect the security of DoD elements,
   personnel, mission-essential cargo, equipment, assets or services. When commensurate with
   risk, consider AT performance/compliance as an evaluation factor for contract award (past
   performance and proposed performance under the instant contract) and as a performance
   metric under the resultant contract.
   2.18.2. All unescorted persons entering DoD installations, to include contractors, sub-
   contractors and laborers, delivery personnel and vendors, must have a valid purpose to enter,
   have their identity proofed and vetted, and be issued, or be in possession of, an authorized
   and valid access credential. Refer to AFI 31-101 and AFI 31-113. For OCONUS locations,
   Commanders will work with local and host nation authorities to identity proof and vet
   applicants to the greatest extent practical and lawful IAW established SOFA.
   2.18.2. (PACAF) Consider using local husbanding contractors which have been previously
   vetted and services meet all requirements. Ensure that contractor support for in-transit forces
   are limited to authorized personnel for the areas of contract support.
   2.18.3. Site-specific risk mitigation measures shall be developed and implemented to
   maintain positive control of DoD contractor and sub-contractor access to and movement
   within installations, sensitive facilities and classified areas.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                        47


   2.18.4. Site-specific risk mitigation measures shall be developed and implemented to screen
   contractor or sub-contractor transportation conveyances for explosive hazards before entry
   into or adjacent to areas with DoD personnel and mission-essential assets.
   2.18.5. Contracts shall comply with the AT clauses of the DFARS.
   2.18.6. Contracts shall incorporate Level I - AT Awareness Training requirements (Standard
   25).
2.19. Standard 19: AT Measures for Critical Asset Security.
   2.19.1. IAW AFI 31-101, risk management measures shall be developed to reduce the risk of
   loss to DoD assets assessed as critical in Standard 5, to include distributive information or
   computer-based systems and networks. Integrate these measures into overall AT program
   efforts.
   2.19.2. AFOSI and the DFC will coordinate with appropriate local, State, and Federal or
   tribal/host nation authorities responsible for the security of non-DoD assets deemed essential
   to the functioning of DoD assets assessed as critical.
   2.19.3. Criticality assessments should be coordinated with affected DCIP and Air Force
   CARM, and conducted IAW the principles in DoDD 3020.40, AFPD 10-24, and identify
   defense critical infrastructure and critical assets.
   2.19.4. (Added-PACAF) At a minimum, installations will identify critical infrastructure to
   a PACAF/CIP/CARM representative through the installation ATWG. Joint Bases will have
   to coordinate which components have responsibility over service specific assets.
       2.19.4.1. (Added-PACAF) The CIP/CARM representative will identify critical Air
       Force assets and infrastructure.
       2.19.4.2. (Added-PACAF) The CIP/CARM representative will determine potential
       impact to Air Force missions and operations resulting from degradation, loss, or
       compromise of critical assets and/or infrastructures.
2.20. Standard 20: Terrorism Incident Response Measures.
   2.20.1. Incident response measures shall be developed consistent with the principles outlined
   in DoD 5200.08-R, DoDI 6055.17, and AFI 10-2501 and referenced in the overall AT plan.
   These measures shall include procedures for determining the nature and scope of incident
   response (including incidents with a CBRNE component); procedures for coordinating
   security, fire, medical, hazardous material and other emergency responder capabilities; and
   steps to recover from the incident while continuing essential operations. Appropriate
   reference will be made in the AT plan referencing the CEMP 10-2 for emergency response
   procedures.
   2.20.2. AF Components to a GCC or GCCs prepare incident response measures for their
   AOR. AFOSI and Force Protection Detachments should be included in contingency
   planning for in-transit units.
       2.20.2.1. (Added-PACAF) ATOs assigned to contingencies, operations, exercises, and
       air shows will always utilize the Force Protection Detachment (FPD) as the conduit for
       all updated threat information for their respectively assigned countries. ATOs will
       always work with the FPDs if one is present in the country of deployment regardless of
 48                                        AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014


      the event. The ATO will report to the appropriate FPD at least one month prior to
      execution of event’s to establish working relationship and obtain the most current in-
      country threat information. Currently there are FPDs in Thailand, Australia, Indonesia,
      and the Philippines. Contact MAJCOM/A7SA for help in working with FPD support.
2.21. Standard 21: Terrorism Consequence Management Measures.
   2.21.1. Consequence management, CBRNE and public health emergency preparedness, and
   emergency response measures are included in AT Plans to complement and support the
   overall AT plan and installation emergency management plans. For the AF these measures
   are found in the CEMP 10-2, MCRP, AT, or IDP. Related contents of other plans should be
   referenced in the AT plan. These measures shall focus on mitigating vulnerabilities of
   personnel, families, facilities and materiel to terrorist use of CBRNE weapons, as well as
   overall disaster planning and preparedness to respond to a terrorist attack. These measures
   shall include integration with DoD emergency responder guidelines provided in DoDI
   6055.17, AFI 10-2501, and mass notification system standards under UFC 4-021-01, Design
   and O&M: Mass Notification Systems; establishment of medical surveillance systems
   consistent with DoDD 6490.02E, Comprehensive Health Surveillance and AFI 10-2604,
   Disease Containment Planning; deployment of CBRNE sensors and detectors; providing
   collective protection when available in High Threat Areas as defined in AFI 10-2501; and
   providing personal protective equipment (PPE) or individual protective equipment (IPE) in
   the following priority and IAW AFI 10-2501:
      2.21.1.1. First Responders and Emergency Responders. Personnel responding to known
      or suspected CBRNE hazards, as determined by incident commander, shall be provided
      protection needed to perform their duties in an unknown hazard environment.
      Responders should use the maximum possible protection until determined otherwise by
      competent authority.
      2.21.1.2. Critical Personnel. Personnel deemed essential to the performance of critical
      military missions (whether military, civilian, contractor, host nation personnel or third
      country nationals), such as critical personnel assigned to mission essential functions
      (MEFs) described in AFI 10-208, Continuity of Operations (COOP) Program, shall be
      provided an appropriate level of protection to support continuity of those critical military
      missions. Since critical missions should be continued without interruption, collective or
      individual protection may be necessary to sustain them.
      2.21.1.3. Essential Personnel. Personnel deemed essential to the performance of
      essential military operations (whether military, civilian, contractor, host nation personnel
      or third country nationals) shall be provided an appropriate level of protection to support
      continuity for those essential military operations. Since essential operations may be
      interrupted for relatively short periods (e.g., hours to days), appropriate protection may be
      necessary to sustain essential operations (i.e., escape, survive and restore essential
      operations).
      2.21.1.4. Other Personnel. For all other persons not in the above categories, the
      objective will be to provide the procedures or protection necessary to safely survive an
      incident, e.g., shelter-in-place or evacuation procedures may fulfill this requirement.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                         49


      2.21.1.5. Included as part of the above categories are those who work or live on DoD
      installations worldwide, family members authorized overseas and DoD contractors if
      designated in contract agreements and designated as essential to perform critical DoD
      missions. The contract Statement of Work or Performance Work Statement must specify
      if PPE will be government or contractor provided.
   2.21.2. Site-specific C-CBRN preparedness and emergency response measures are
   developed and coordinated through the Emergency Management Flight and base medical
   personnel. These measures are implemented and synchronized with a corresponding FPCON
   measure for CBRNE-specific threats.
   2.21.3. Support agreements (i.e., MOU, MOA, MAA) or other similarly constructed
   protocols will be established with the appropriate local, State, Federal or tribal/host nation
   authorities to support AT plan execution and augment incident response and post-incident
   consequence management activities.
   2.21.4. The installation shall maintain mass warning and notification capabilities to warn all
   personnel immediately, but not longer than 10 minutes after incident notification and
   verification. The mass warning and notification must give response direction using
   intelligible voice communication, visible signals, text, text messaging, computer notification,
   tactile, or other communication methods.
   2.21.5. Installation public health emergency response measures that are synchronized with
   FPCON levels shall be developed and implemented.
   2.21.6. (Added-PACAF) Commanders shall include terrorist consequence management
   preparedness and response measures in the installation AT plan focused on the Design Basis
   Threat (DBT). General security situations that should be included in the AT Plan include
   hostage taking, Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) attacks, active shooter
   on base or at on-base schools, hijacking, etc., are all examples that need to be addressed.
   Specific Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) response procedures will be included in the
   installation Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP).
2.22. Standard 22: Force Protection Condition (FPCON) Measures.
   2.22.1. The GCC is responsible for establishing the baseline FPCON for their AOR and
   procedures to ensure that FPCON measures are uniformly disseminated and implemented.
   The AF Component to the GCC is typically delegated to manage this task for the GCC. See
   Attachment 2 for a detailed listing of FPCON measures.
      2.22.1.1. (Added-PACAF) USPACOM sets the baseline FPCON for the USPACOM
      AOR with the exception of Alaska where USNORTHCOM has baseline declaration
      authority. The commanders of USFJ, USFK, NAFs, and installation commanders can
      adjust FPCONs for their geographic areas and personnel/assets; however it must not be
      less than the established USPACOM or USNORTHCOM (as appropriate) FPCON
      baseline.
      2.22.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Andersen AFB/CC can initially establish FPCON Baseline
      above USPACOM minimum, but the JRM/CC has final FPCON authority.
   2.22.2. Installation commanders with AT responsibility and higher shall:
50                                       AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014


     2.22.2.1. Determine an appropriate FPCON level for those personnel and assets for
     which they have AT responsibility. Subordinate commanders (to include GSUs and
     elements ‘off-site’) may raise a higher-level commander’s FPCON level, but they shall
     not lower the FPCON level without the higher-level commander’s written concurrence.
     2.22.2.2. Classify site-specific AT measures and physical security actions, linked to a
     FPCON as “CONFIDENTIAL.” When separated from the AT plan, specific AT
     measures linked to a FPCON and site-specific FPCON levels may be downgraded to
     ”FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY,” IAW DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program.
     2.22.2.3. Notify their next higher level commander of any FPCON measures the
     installation is unable to fully implement or if it does not apply. The notification will
     include rationale, corrective action or mitigation, ECD for full implementation, and
     installation OPR.
     2.22.2.4. Establish a review mechanism to ensure locally changed FPCON levels are
     commensurate with changing threats and the principles of risk management. This is
     essential because implementation of FPCON measures at elevated FPCON levels for an
     extended duration can be counterproductive to effective security and overall mission
     accomplishment. In some circumstances, based upon local conditions and the threat
     environment, commanders should consider requesting HHQ approval to implement a
     lower-level FPCON and supplement with other local security measures and RAMs as an
     effective alternative to executing the higher-level FPCON measures.
        2.22.2.4.1. (Added-PACAF) All Installation/NAF ATOs shall report FPCON
        and/or additional measure changes to HQ PACAF/A7SA immediately upon
        implementation. Included in the report should be the change, the intelligence driving
        the change, and the level at which the change was dictated. Installations that report to
        a NAF must coordinate. This notification should be conducted through Wing
        Command Post to PACAF Command Center.
        2.22.2.4.2. (Added-PACAF) Commanders at all levels (e.g., installation, tenant,
        squadron, GSU, etc.), shall establish local measures to supplement those listed in
        DODI 2000.16, AFI 10-245 and USPACOM OPORD 5050-08. Any additional local
        measures will be forwarded to the PACAF/ATWG for review through the PACAF
        Command Center (PCC) 448-8500.
        2.22.2.4.3. (Added-PACAF) . PACAF communications and information
        commanders, Post Masters and installation official mail managers will comply with
        FPCON measures outlined in HQ PACAF Air Postal Squadron (AIRPS) Operating
        Instruction 10-1, PACAF Postal Antiterrorism Program, available at the HQ
        PACAF/AIRPS        home     page      on     the    Air     Force     Portal   at
        https://www.hqpacaf.af.mil/airps/, or by contacting PACAF AIRPS/DO at email:
        PACAF.AIRPS.DO@us.af.mil
     2.22.2.5. Develop and implement site-specific FPCON measures for AF installations and
     separate facilities to supplement the FPCON measures and actions enumerated for each
     FPCON level. In addition to establishing procedures for raising FPCON levels, ensure
     procedures are developed for stepping back down from higher FPCONs. Consult GCC
     supplementary FPCON guidance for in-transit forces. The development of site-specific
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                        51


      FPCON measures must permit sufficient time and space to determine hostile intent, while
      fully considering constraints imposed by standing rules of engagement in CJCSI
      3121.01B, Standing Rules of Engagement/Standing Rules For the Use of Force For U.S.
      Forces, and rules of force under AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
      Personnel. Organic intelligence, CI and law enforcement resources, institutional
      knowledge of the area and comprehensive understanding of organic capabilities,
      supported by national and AOR assets, shall be leveraged in directing tailored FPCON
      measures to be implemented at specific sites.
2.23. Standard 23: AT Training and Exercises.
   2.23.1. All elements of the AT program shall be integrated into training and exercises related
   to Force Protection. AT lessons learned and the AT risk assessment (derived from the
   IDRMP) should guide the focus of training and exercises to ensure activities are supported by
   relevant threat, vulnerability, and criticality information.
      2.23.1.1. (Added-PACAF) All units/organizations should consult their installation
      TWG in the initial exercise or deployment planning stages for threat
      assessments/information and possible mitigation measures. PACAF/TWG will coordinate
      on all pre-deployment assessments prior to exercises involving USAF assets or
      deployments.
   2.23.2. Elements of the AT plan shall be exercised annually and synchronized with other ID,
   EM, COOP and CARM program requirements. The installation shall coordinate with the
   installation EET to develop a comprehensive annual exercise program which provides for
   individual and collective AT proficiency training and realistic AT exercise scenarios. The
   AT focus of exercises will be on the identification of vulnerabilities and AT program
   shortfalls which could contribute to the risk of terrorist attack against DoD personnel and
   assets. Scenarios must, at a minimum, exercise terrorist threat assessment and planning,
   mitigation and response to a terrorist incident (to include AT-specific MOA/MOU/MAAs
   and participation by local support elements), and consequence management measures
   following a terrorist incident. Site-specific FPCON measures from current FPCON through
   FPCON CHARLIE must also be exercised annually at all AF installations and separate
   facilities.
   2.23.3. AT exercise documentation shall be maintained for no less than two years by
   Installation EET. Identified exercise findings will be presented to the ATWG and
   tracked/managed by installation EET until corrected or closed. AT lessons learned must be
   incorporated into appropriate plans and programs and submitted into the Joint Lessons
   Learned Information System (JLLIS) at https://www.jllis.mil. AT training shall also be
   incorporated into pre-deployment training and exercises as required by the GCC. Pre-
   deployment AT training exercises should include terrorism scenarios specific to the deployed
   location and based on current enemy Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. Refer to
   paragraph 2.7.2 for a list of AT threat planning scenarios to assist in exercise development.
   Units will ensure they allow for a local Table and Rule within their respective file plans to
   maintain this reference data for unit continuity and action as required.

2.24. Standard 24: Formal AT Training.
   2.24.1. The AF’s formal AT Training Program shall consist of: Level I - AT Awareness
   Training (Standard 25), Level II - ATO Training (Standard 26), Level III - Pre-Command AT
   Training (Standard 27), Level IV - AT Executive Seminar (Standard 28), AOR-specific
   training (Standard 29) and HRP AT training (Standard 16).
   2.24.2. AT training shall be integrated into training for all AF personnel as required by this
   Instruction and when deemed appropriate by Commanders with AT responsibility. A solid
   training foundation for all grades, skills and functional areas is essential to successful
   implementation and long term effectiveness of AT programs.
      2.24.2.1. Unit commanders, through their training NCO or section, shall ensure that all
      assigned personnel complete appropriate formal AT training. Additional protection
      related courses (such as Security Engineering Design Course and Dynamics of
      International Terrorism) are encouraged. Individual training records shall be updated
      accordingly.
      2.24.2.2. If personnel have not received formal AT training as required, training shall be
      provided as soon as possible. Units receiving untrained personnel (PCS or deployed)
      should report training deficiencies through the AF chain of command to the appropriate
      losing MAJCOM functional office. Report other Service training discrepancies through
      the appropriate AF Component to the GCC.
2.25. Standard 25: Level I - AT Awareness Training.
   2.25.1. The objective of Level I - AT Awareness Training is to provide all AF personnel
   with requisite knowledge necessary to remain vigilant for possible terrorist actions and
   enable employment of the AT TTP as outlined in DoD O-2000.12-H.
   2.25.2. Every AF Service member, civilian employee, and local national or third country
   national in a direct-hire status by the DoD, regardless of grade or position shall complete
   Level I - AT Awareness Training annually.
      2.25.2.1. New accession AF military personnel are provided Level I - AT Awareness
      Training during initial accession training or general military subject training. This initial
      accession Level I - AT Awareness Training shall be provided by a qualified Level I
      Awareness Training Instructor.
      2.25.2.2. Post-accession annual Level I - AT Awareness Training may be accomplished
      by either a Level I - qualified instructor, or by completing the “Force Protection”
      computer based training (CBT) course on the Advanced Distributed Learning System
      (ADLS)      or    the    Defense     Technical    Information    Center   (DTIC)    at
      https://atlevel1.dtic.mil/at for individuals without access to NIPR, possessing a CAC
      card, nor enrolled in DEERS. The ADLS “Force Protection” CBT does not meet
      Department of State (DoS) Chief of Mission (CoM) requirements for Level I - AT
      Awareness Training.
          2.25.2.2.1. AF personnel being assigned to a location where they will be under the
          responsibility of the DoS CoM for force protection must receive Level I - AT
          Awareness refresher training from a Level I-qualified instructor.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                           53


         2.25.2.2.2. Unit Training Managers track annual Level I - AT Awareness Training
         through the ADLS. If ADLS is not available or not applicable, Unit Training
         Managers will document AT Awareness Training on ancillary training records. Unit
         Training Managers will provide AT training status and statistics to their chain of
         command or the ATO upon request. Unit Deployment Managers and FSS will
         confirm training is current prior to approving OCONUS deployment or PCS orders.
     2.25.2.3. DoD contractors shall be provided AT information as required by DFAR,
     Section 252.225-7043. Level I - AT Awareness Training shall be offered to all DoD
     contractor employees in the terms and conditions of the contract. The ATWG should
     determine the best method for offering AT Awareness training to contractor employees.
         2.25.2.3.1. (Added-PACAF) AT Level I training will include improvised explosive
         device (IED) recognition, biological/chemical response actions as part of the WMD
         session and Blue Dart procedures.
  2.25.3. Commanders will ensure dependent family members ages 14 years and older
  traveling OCONUS on official business (e.g., on an accompanied permanent change of
  station move) shall complete Level I - AT Awareness Training as part of their pre-departure
  requirements. FSS will confirm training is completed before issuing dependent travel orders.
  Commanders will also encourage dependent family members to complete Level I - AT
  Awareness Training before any personal travel such as leave to an OCONUS location or any
  area where the TTL is MODERATE or higher.
  2.25.4. Level I - AT Awareness Training instructors must have completed an AF-approved
  Level II - ATO Training course as outlined in Standard 26 of this publication. ATOs will
  maintain appointment letters of qualified instructors. If a certified instructor is not available,
  as an interim solution, unit commanders in coordination with the ATO may certify and
  appoint qualified SMEs to conduct training. Qualified SMEs must have completed Level I -
  AT Awareness Training and the Level II Refresher CBT available on ADLS. Commanders
  must clearly describe the qualifications of the individual in the appointment letter to justify
  this method and explain why other options are not feasible.
  2.25.5. The ADLS “Force Protection” course covering Level I - AT Awareness Training will
  be updated annually by HQ AFSFC/SFOZ.
  2.25.6. The AF’s Level I - AT Awareness Training is built upon the minimum requirements
  outlined in DoDI 2000.16, Standard 25, Table E3.T2 which is supplemented with topics
  specific to AF training. The AF Level I - AT Awareness (Force Protection) CBT is based
  upon and incorporates the DoD-sponsored and certified computer based Level I - AT
  Awareness Training course. Table 2.2 below outlines the minimum required topics to be
  covered in AF Level I - AT Awareness Training.
     2.25.6.1. (Added-PACAF) Wing ATOs will report any personnel that PCS into a
     foreign country that have not received/completed Level I training to PACAF/A7SA. All
     individuals must receive the Level I training within 30 days of PCS or deployment.

2.26. Standard 26: Level II – ATO and ATR Training.
   2.26.1. Each USAF installation and separate facility shall have a Level II certified ATO
   appointed in writing. Each unit, who is authorized manning is 299 or less, supporting the
   installation and separate facility shall have an ATR appointed in writing. Level II – ATO and
   ATR Training prepares and qualifies Installation ATOs and Unit-level ATRs to perform their
   duties as AT program advisors and coordinators. Level II training is separated into two
   distinct tracks to ensure appropriate focus for the respective roles of ATOs and ATRs.
      2.26.1.1. Newly assigned ATOs and ATRs shall complete training within 180 days of
      appointment. Deploying ATOs will complete training prior to deployment in accordance
      with line remarks. Unit level ATRs unable to secure in-residence training will complete
      the AT Level II Refresher CBT (within 180 days) until they are able to attend an in-
      residence AT Level II course. For both ATOs and ATRs, Level II refresher training must
      be completed once every three years to maintain qualification. Refresher training may be
      accomplished by taking the “AT Level II Refresher” CBT available on ADLS or by
      attending a Military Department -approved Level II course either in residence or offered
      by an MTT.
   2.26.2. Level II – ATO and ATR training course instructors should have at least two years of
   experience in the field of Antiterrorism and should seek to remain proficient and further their
   expertise by attending seminars and courses related to Antiterrorism such as Security
   Engineering Design and Dynamics of International Terrorism. Also consider coordinating
   with JSIVA/AFVAT to shadow teams during an assessment. At a minimum, Level II
   instructors will have completed the following qualification requirements and have task
   certifications documented in training records as appropriate:
      2.26.2.1. Formal training from an AF instructor’s course such as Principles of
      Instruction. Personnel may instruct students prior to completing an instructor’s course if
      supervised by a certified instructor.
      2.26.2.2. AF-approved Level II - ATO Training course.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                  55


     2.26.2.3. CVAMP training.
     2.26.2.3. (PACAF) PACAF RTC/Commando Warrior Cadre will maintain a Level II
     Course instruction capability. Instructors should have the minimum requirements, have
     (2) years total experience as an ATO (deployed, home station, or a combination of the
     two).     PACAF/A7SA goal will be to certify the course of instruction in person to
     properly validate the class.
  2.26.3. Level II - ATO and ATR Training must reflect current information on terrorism and
  AT Program guidance. The course plan must also include measurable course objectives and
  evaluation methods to ensure student proficiency. The AF’s Level II – ATO and ATR
  Training is built upon and supplements the minimum requirements outlined in DoDI
  2000.16, Standard 26, Table E3.T3. Training will be developed and reviewed annually by
  the MAJCOM sponsoring the course. Required course topics for the AF’s Level II - ATO
  and ATR Training are listed below in Table 2.3. MAJCOM-specific requirements may be
  added to the core curriculum. MAJCOM ATPMs shall submit Level II - ATO Training
  course plans to AFSFC/SFOZ for annual review/approval during the first quarter of each
  calendar year.
  2.26.3. (PACAF) Wing ATOs that have not been formally trained as Level II certified, will
  request AT Level II training through HQ PACAF/A7SA.

  2.27.1. Level III - Pre-Command AT Training provides prospective squadron, group, and
  wing commanders and civilian equivalent positions with requisite knowledge to direct and
  supervise an AT Program.
  2.27.2. Squadron, group and wing commanders and civilian leaders in equivalent positions
  with AT responsibility shall complete Level III - Pre-Command AT Training prior to
  assuming command.
  2.27.3. MAJCOMs will ensure this training is provided to squadron commanders. Training
  may be conducted during MAJCOM Squadron Commander Orientation seminars or by other
  means determined by the MAJCOM. Group and wing commanders shall receive the training
  through group and wing commander pre-command courses. Follow-on training may be
  conducted at the installation-level as a refresher or supplement to briefings offered in
  commander courses.
     2.27.3.1. MAJCOMs shall determine minimum instructor qualifications and select
     instructors for Level III - Pre-Command AT Training. Instructors should be Level II
     qualified, have experience in the field of Antiterrorism, be familiar with command
     considerations regarding AT programs, and be able to explain the relationship and
     integration of Force Protection programs. Installation ATOs may conduct Level III
     supplemental training at the installation level in coordination with MAJCOM ATPMs.

AT Planning—The process of developing specific guidance and execution-oriented instructions
for subordinates. An AT plan contains command-specific guidance for the establishment of an
AT program and the implementation of the AT Standards.
AT Program—One of several security-related programs that fall under the overarching
combating terrorism and FP programs. The AT program is a collective, proactive effort focused
on the prevention and detection of terrorist attacks against DoD personnel and their families,
facilities, installations and infrastructure critical to mission accomplishment as well as the
preparation to defend against and planning for the response to the consequences of terrorist
incidents. Although not elements of AT, plans for terrorism consequence management
preparedness and response measures as well as plans for continuing essential military operations
are important adjuncts to an effective AT program. The minimum elements of an AT program
are AT risk management, planning, training and exercises, resource application and program
reviews.
AT Program Review—The systematic assessment of the AT program against the AT Standards.
AT Resource Application—The process of applying risk management to vulnerabilities and
where the resultant risk is not acceptable after applying mitigation measures, elevating the
vulnerability with a resource request using the existing PPB&E system, the CCIF, the Physical
Security Program and other funding mechanisms. Central to success in resource application is
tracking and ensuring sufficient funding for identified AT program life-cycle costs and assessed
shortfalls to mitigate risk associated with terrorist capabilities.
AT Risk Management—The process of systematically identifying, assessing and controlling
risks arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance possible adverse
outcomes with mission benefits. The end products of the AT program risk management process
shall be the identification of DoD elements and personnel that are vulnerable to the identified
threat attack means. From the assessment of risk based upon the three critical components of AT
risk management (threat assessment, criticality assessment and vulnerability assessment), the
commander must determine which DoD elements and personnel are at greatest risk and how best
to employ given resources and FP measures to deter, mitigate or prepare for a terrorist incident.
AT Training and Exercises—The process of developing individual, leader and collective skills
and of conducting comprehensive exercises to validate plans for AT incident response,
consequence management and continuity of essential military operations.
Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT)—Biological agents and toxins that present a high
bioterrorism risk to national security and have the greatest potential for adverse public health
impact with mass casualties of humans and/or animals or that pose a severe threat to plant health
or to plant products. The lists are reviewed and updated by HHS/CDC and USDA/APHIS.
Agents and toxins that are excluded in Title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 73, and Title
7, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 331 are excluded as BSAT.
Combating Terrorism (CbT)—For the purposes of this Instruction, combating terrorism within
the DoD encompasses all actions, including AT, counterterrorism, terrorism consequence
management (preparation for and response to the consequences of a terrorist incident or event)
and terrorism intelligence support (collection and dissemination of terrorism-related
information), taken to oppose terrorism throughout the entire threat spectrum, including terrorist
use of CBRNE.

those measures taken to protect public health and safety, restore essential government services,
and provide emergency relief to governments, businesses and individuals affected by the
consequences of a CBRNE situation. For domestic consequence management, the primary
authority rests with the States to respond. The Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) is the Lead Federal Agency (LFA) for domestic consequence management and the
Department of State (DoS) is the LFA for foreign consequence management.
Coordination—The necessary action to ensure adequate exchange of information to integrate,
synchronize and deconflict operations between separate organizations. Coordination is not
necessarily a process of gaining approval, but is most often used for mutual exchange of
information. Normally used between functions of a supporting staff. Direct liaison authorized
(DIRLAUTH) is used to coordinate with an organization outside of the immediate staff or
organization.
Counterintelligence (CI)—Information gathered and activities conducted to protect against
espionage, other intelligence activities, sabotage or assassinations conducted by or on behalf of
foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign organizations or persons, or international
terrorist activities.

of information collected through investigations, forensics, crime scene and evidentiary processes
to establish intent, history, capability, vulnerability and modus operandi of threat and criminal
elements.
Crisis Management—For the purpose of this Instruction, crisis management is those measures
taken to resolve a hostile situation and to investigate and prepare a criminal case for prosecution
under Federal law. Crisis management shall include a response to an incident involving WMD,
an improvised explosive device, or a hostage crisis that is beyond the capability of the LFA.
Critical Asset—An asset that is of such extraordinary importance that its incapacitation or
destruction would have a serious, debilitating effect on the ability of one or more DoD
Components or Defense Infrastructure Sector Lead Agents to execute the task or mission
essential tasks it supports. Task Critical Assets are used to identify defense critical assets.
Criticality Assessment—For the purposes of this Instruction, an assessment of the effect of
temporary or permanent loss of key assets or infrastructures on the installation or a unit’s ability
to perform its mission. The assessment also examines costs of recovery and reconstitution
including time, funds, capability and infrastructure support.
Defense Critical Asset—An asset of such extraordinary importance to DoD operations in peace,
crisis and war that its incapacitation or destruction would have a very serious, debilitating effect
on the ability of the Department of Defense to fulfill its mission.

enable the effective employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy.
Force protection does not include actions to defeat the enemy or protect against accidents,
weather or disease (JP 1-02). [The process of detecting threats and hazards to the Air Force and
its mission, and applying measures to deter, preempt, negate, or mitigate them based on an
acceptable level of risk (AFDD 3-10). The Air Force’s integrated approach demands that actions
to both defeat the enemy and protect against hazards such as accidents, weather, disease, and
natural disasters be incorporated in how the AF defines Force Protection.]
Force Protection Condition (FPCON)—A DoD-approved system standardizing the
Department’s identification, recommended preventive actions and responses to terrorist threats

                                         Attachment 2
               FORCE PROTECTION CONDITION (FPCON) MEASURES

A2.1. General. The DoD FPCON System describes the progressive level of protective
measures that are implemented by all the DoD Components in anticipation of or in response to a
terrorist threat or attack. The FPCON System is the principal means through which commanders
apply an operational decision on how to best guard against the terrorist threat. The protective
measures identified in the FPCON System assist commanders in reducing the risks of terrorist
attacks and other security threats to DoD personnel, units and activities. The measures below are
derived from DoD AT Standard 22 (DODI 2000.16, Enclosure 4, DoD FPCON) and include AF
modifications. Commanders will ensure these measures and developed measures address local
and operational risks. Commanders must consider GCC policies, local laws, mutual support
agreements and/or the SOFA. Air Force commanders are responsible for implementing FPCON
measures.
   A2.1.1. Commanders shall ensure the following when implementing FPCON measures:
       A2.1.1.1. Ensure there is an effective AT plan and the plan is widely known and
       practiced in order to use every airman as a sensor.
       A2.1.1.2. Analyze the threat and plan courses of action to defeat those threats. Detailed
       planning against plausible enemy courses of action will often point to vulnerabilities
       which can be mitigated through adjustments to TTPs and further mitigated through
       innovation and programming.
       A2.1.1.3. Consider force-on-force, “red team,” or intruder exercises to test COAs.
       Development and implementation of effective friendly COAs to counter known threats
       offers a reasonable deterrent effect and the opportunity for long-term success against
       terrorist attack.
       A2.1.1.4. Ensure personnel assigned tasks directed by FPCON measures are properly
       trained and available to carry out the tasks.
       A2.1.1.5. Based on the threat, employ sufficient patrols to deter enemy action, disrupt
       terrorist planning and respond to incidents or attacks against the installation. Patrols
       should focus protection on critical operational assets, mission support infrastructure and
       mass gathering locations.
       A2.1.1.6. Consider placing barriers to create standoff around identified critical assets,
       facilities with BSAT, restricted areas, high-occupancy facilities, flight line entry points
       and high value resource areas.
       A2.1.1.7. Review and be familiar with mutual aid and host-tenant support agreements.
       Keep law enforcement agencies (federal, state and local) appraised of the current
       situation and threat to determine the level of incident support the installation provides or
       receives.
       A2.1.1.8. Ensure the installation Disaster Response Force and its sub elements are
       trained and available for response as described in AFI 10-2501.
 80                                         AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014


   A2.1.2. The DoD FPCON System consists of five progressive levels of increasing AT
   protective measures.
   A2.1.3. Site-specific AT measures and physical security actions, linked to a FPCON, shall
   be classified CONFIDENTIAL. When separated from the AT plan, specific AT measures
   linked to a FPCON and site-specific FPCON levels may be downgraded to FOR OFFICIAL
   USE ONLY, if appropriate.
   A2.1.4. Upon declaration of a FPCON level, all listed security measures for that FPCON
   level shall be implemented immediately unless waived in writing by the appropriate GCC or
   delegated representative. In non-DoD controlled facilities housing DoD occupants, DoD
   organizations shall implement applicable FPCON measures in space directly controlled by
   DoD to the extent possible. The supplementing RAMs and command-unique or site-specific
   measures should also be implemented to complicate a terrorist group’s operational planning
   and targeting.
   A2.1.5. AF installations and separate facilities shall supplement each FPCON measure in
   this instruction with site-specific details describing how the measure is to be implemented
   locally, to include responsibilities assigned to subordinate units and organizations.
A2.1.6. Air field-specific measures are for installations and facilities with a permanently
functioning air field. Installations and facilities with an emergency helicopter pad should review
and implement any applicable air field-specific measures when they anticipate air operations.

   A2.1.7. The CBRNE-related FPCON measures contained in this publication are not all
   inclusive. Additional CBRNE FPCON measures are in the AF Civil Engineer Support
   Agency (AFCESA) CEMP 10-2 template and AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in a Chemical,
   Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High- Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Environment. Each
   MAJCOM and installation should also develop additional CBRNE FPCON measures
   applicable to their location.
A2.2. FPCON NORMAL. This condition applies when a general global threat of possible
terrorist activity exists and warrants a routine security posture. At a minimum, access control
will be conducted at all DoD installations and facilities.
   A2.2.1. Measure NORMAL 1: Secure and randomly inspect buildings, rooms and storage
   areas not in regular use.
   A2.2.2. Measure NORMAL 2 (AF Modified): Conduct random security checks of vehicles
   and persons entering facilities under the jurisdiction of the United States.
       A2.2.2.1. Measure NORMAL 2.1 (AF Added): Conduct random vehicle inspections at
       installation entry points in addition to Random Installation Entry/Exit Vehicle Check
       (RIEVC) as directed by installation commanders. Implement 100% inspection of large
       commercial vehicles. MAJCOM and local planners should define large commercial
       vehicles in IDPs based on geographical location, character of local transport and threat.
       Conduct random vehicle inspections at entrances to restricted areas beyond inspection
       requirements listed in AFI 31-101.
   A2.2.3. Measure NORMAL 3:           Limit access points for vehicles and personnel
   commensurate with a reasonable flow of traffic.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                              81


   A2.2.4. Measure NORMAL 4 (AF Modified): Identify defense critical infrastructure and
   critical assets, facilities with BSAT, and high-occupancy buildings.
   A2.2.5. Measure NORMAL 5 (AF Added): Implement a daily RAM program involving the
   entire installation with emphasis on identifying surveillance activities and disrupting the
   terrorist attack cycle. Installations will tailor their RAM program to meet the threat and
   mitigate vulnerabilities.
   A2.2.6. Measure NORMAL 6 (AF Added): Conduct 100% “hands on” identification
   verification of all vehicle operators and pedestrians entering installations. When available,
   employ the Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) to validate identification
   credentials.
   A2.2.7. Measure NORMAL 7 (AF Added): Where no permanent channeling measures are
   built into the gates, emplace barriers or obstacles on in-bound and out-bound lanes at
   installation entry points to mitigate high-speed installation access through entry and exit
   lanes, IAW UFC 4-022-01. Prevent base entry through exit lanes. Ensure sufficient number
   and types of barriers remain for increased FPCON/RAMs.
   A2.2.8. Measure NORMAL 8 (AF Added): Identify local vendors that are able to provide
   rapid stocks of emergency response equipment and supplies IAW local response plans.
A2.3. FPCON ALPHA (AF Modified). This condition applies when there is an increased
general threat of possible terrorist activity against personnel or facilities, the nature and extent of
which are unpredictable, and circumstances do not justify full implementation of FPCON
BRAVO measures. However, it may be necessary to implement certain measures from higher
FPCONs measures resulting from intelligence received or as a deterrent. The measures in this
FPCON must be capable of being maintained indefinitely.
   A2.3.1. Measure ALPHA 1: Fully implement all measures of FPCON NORMAL.
   A2.3.2. Measure ALPHA 2: At regular intervals, inform personnel and family members of
   the general situation. Ensure personnel arriving for duty are briefed on the threat. Also,
   remind them to be alert for and to report suspicious activities, such as the presence of
   unfamiliar personnel and vehicles, suspicious parcels and possible surveillance attempts.
       A2.3.2.1. Measure ALPHA 2.1 (AF Added): Post signs at installation gates and utilize
       mass communication systems to inform/remind personnel of the FPCON level.
   A2.3.3. Measure ALPHA 3: The duty officer or personnel with access to building plans as
   well as the plans for area evacuations must be available at all times. Plans should be in place

                                         Attachment 3
                              TERRORIST THREAT LEVELS

A3.1. General. The standardized DoD methodology that describes the terrorist threat to DoD
personnel, facilities and interests shall be used to determine Terrorism Threat Levels (TTL). The
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) sets the DoD TTL for all countries. Terrorism threat levels
are established as the result of all-source analysis and incorporation of GCC and Military
Department input. The Joint Intelligence Task Force – Countering Terrorism coordinates
country TTLs with appropriate GCCs, Services and Defense Attaches.
   A3.1.1. DIA and the responsible GCC may assign different threat levels to the same country.
   This is possible because analysts occasionally disagree about the conclusions to be drawn
   from available information. Threat assessments provide information to assist commanders in
   determining the appropriate FPCON level and measures. FPCON level declarations remain
   the exclusive responsibility of commanders. Threat levels are not tied to FPCON levels in
   any way and should not be confused. National-level DoD organizations cannot provide all
   intelligence that might be needed to make FPCON level determinations. Information from
   regional and tactical intelligence and local law enforcement authorities must also be
   considered.
   A3.1.2. Threat assessments are not to be confused with DoD-designated high physical threat
   countries. DoD-designated high physical threat countries pertain exclusively to the DoD
   Travel Security Policy.
A3.2. Terrorist Threat Levels. In assessing the terrorist threat to U.S. personnel and interests,
DoD intelligence agencies use a four-step scale to describe the severity of the threat. The
following lists the threat levels and the combinations of analysis-based factors used to determine
the level:
   A3.2.1. HIGH: Anti-US terrorists are operationally active and use large casualty producing
   attacks as their preferred method of operation. There is a substantial DoD presence and the
   operating environment favors the terrorist.
   A3.2.2. SIGNIFICANT: Anti-US terrorists are present and attack personnel as their
   preferred method of operation or a group uses large casualty producing attacks as their
   preferred method, but has limited operational activity. The operating environment is neutral.
   A3.2.3. MODERATE: Terrorists are present, but there are no indications of anti-US
   activity. The operating environment favors the host nation/US.
   A3.2.4. LOW: No group is detected or the group activity is non-threatening.
A3.3. Terrorist threat levels are a product of the following four factors.
   A3.3.1. Operational Capability. This factor focuses on the attack methods used by the group
   and other measures that enhance its effectiveness, such as state sponsorship and ingenious
   use of technology. The key element is whether the group has the capability and willingness
   to conduct large casualty producing attacks, for example a suicide vehicle bomb containing
   thousands of kilograms of explosives or WMD timed to kill the most personnel at the target.
   Groups that selectively assassinate individuals or conduct late night bombings causing
90                                          AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014


  limited property damage pose a decreased threat. The ability to operate on a regional or
  transnational basis and the overall professionalism of the group is also assessed.
  A3.3.2. Intentions. This factor is the stated desire or history of terrorist attacks against U.S.
  interests. Recent substantial attacks in the country or, if the group is transnational, the
  conduct of operations in other countries is the higher end of the threat scale. This is
  especially true if the intentions are anti-DoD. The basis of the group ideology, whether the
  group is more focused on the host nation rather than U.S. interests is the other key
  component. Whether the group will react to high profile U.S.-led international events, such
  as intervention in the Balkans, is also considered and rated.
  A3.3.3. Activity. This factor is an assessment of the actions the group is conducting and
  whether that activity is focused on serious preparations for an attack. The highest threat is
  credible indications of U.S. targeting to include the movement of key operatives, final
  intelligence collection and movement of weapons to the target vicinity. Less threatening
  actions are contingency planning, training and logistical support. Activities that would make
  the group less likely to attack, such as robust fund raising or effective safe haven are
  considered. Whether the group has recently been disrupted by arrests or strikes on training
  camps will reduce the threat, at least in the short term.
  A3.3.4. Operating Environment. This factor rates how the overall environment influences
  the ability, opportunity and motivation to attack DoD interests in a given location. An
  important element of this factor is the capability of the host nation security apparatus to
  combat terrorism, its degree of cooperation with the U.S. and the quality of the reporting on
  terrorist groups in the country. A key element is whether there is a DoD presence and if so
  the type, size, location, political sensitivity and if temporary, its duration. It is also important
  to consider if the group is focused on DoD as its primary target for anti-US attacks. Another
  part of this factor is the overall political, economic and military stability of the country and
  its effect on the ability of a group to attack.

                RISK MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCING PROCESSES

A4.1. Overview. The commander has an inherent command responsibility to reduce risks that
threaten the mission with available resources. Risk management, as described in AFPD 31-1,
aids the commander in assessing risk. If the commander cannot internally correct, mitigate or
assume risk, they must elevate these vulnerabilities and associated risk(s) through CVAMP.
CVAMP will forward the vulnerability through the chain of command to the GCC, who will
decide if the vulnerability will be reported higher.
A4.2. Resourcing. Emphasis should be placed on acquiring resources to detect, assess, warn,
defend or recover in order to prevent hostile acts or mitigate the effects. It is inherent upon the
organization to assess the resource requirement against other organizational unfunded or funded
requirements and determine if an internal reallocation of funding is appropriate and possible.
CVAMP is used to collate and track AT vulnerabilities and resourcing. The status of
vulnerabilities entered into CVAMP should be documented in CVAMP.
A4.3. AF Funding Sources.
   A4.3.1. Planning, Programming, Budget and Execution (PPB&E). The PPB&E process
   includes requests considered during the POM funding cycle. This program is for long-term
   planning and the funds will not be available for two to five years. Information on the
   PPB&E process can be found in the DoD Management Initiative Decision 913.
   A4.3.2. Installation and MAJCOM budget process and commander’s discretionary funds.
   A4.3.3. Many PEC and/or funding appropriations (AT, Physical Security, EM, Medical,
   Construction, Base Defense, Base Operating Support, Communications, Weapons of Mass
   Destruction Threat Response, Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defense Program, Fire
   Emergency Services; Sustainment Restoration and Modernization (SRM), and military
   construction (MILCON), etc.) may be used to fund AT resourcing activities. Commanders
   will consider all PEC and funding appropriation sources as authorized by law and AF policy
   and guidance.
   A4.3.4. Use Antiterrorism Program Element 28047 as the primary funding source for
   manpower authorizations, antiterrorism equipment, procurement, military construction and
   the associated costs specifically identified and measurable to those resources and activities
   associated with the Air Force AT Program.
   A4.3.5. Specialized funds designed for AT and the war on terrorism.
A4.4. Combatant Commander’s Initiative Fund (CCIF). This program provides funds for
emergency or unforeseen (emergent) high priority force protection projects or equipment. It is
designed for requirements that need to be funded in the current fiscal year and provides a means
for the GCC to react to unforeseen requirements from changes in a terrorist threat, threat levels,
force protection doctrine/standards, as well as unanticipated requirements identified as a result of
VAs, tactical operations and exercising AT plans. The fund is not intended to subsidize ongoing
projects, supplement budget shortfalls, or support routine activities, which are a Service
responsibility. Requests must be submitted through the responsible MAJCOM to the AF

Component Command which will submit to the appropriate GCC, and the GCC will prioritize
and submit to the CJCS. Submission instructions are outlined in CJCSI 7401.1.
   A4.4.1. Emergency CCIF Requirement. An unanticipated requirement created by a
   combination of circumstances or the resulting state that requires immediate action to prevent,
   deter, or respond to a terrorist act.
   A4.4.2. Emergent CCIF Requirement. A newly-formed, unexpected requirement resulting
   from a logical consequence of unforeseen circumstances calling for prompt action.
   A4.4.3. AF Component Commands to GCCs must submit requests for CCIF funds through
   CVAMP.
   A4.4.4. Emergent requirements should be less than 2 years old. The requestor must have an
   approved, executable and exercised AT plan.
A4.5. Effectively Managing the Resource Allocation Process.
   A4.5.1. Ensure you plan for training and maintenance costs into the out years.
   A4.5.2. The ATO needs to work closely with affected functional areas, installation financial
   advisors/comptroller and contracting from the beginning to address requirements. This will
   assist in identifying the appropriation sources and funding amounts.
   A4.5.3. Adequately articulating and justifying requirements is crucial.
   A4.5.4. Determine all appropriate potential funding sources and submit requests through the
   various channels. Once a requirement is funded by a source, cancel all other requests. Note:
   The Joint Staff does not allow the same request to be submitted through both the PPB&E and
   CCIF process.
   A4.5.5. There are organizations that can aid the commander in identifying technology to
   satisfy requirements: Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG), Technical
   Support Working Group (TSWG), Joint Requirement Office for Chemical, Biological,
   Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JRO-CBRND), and the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons
   Directorate (JNLWD). These organizations are separately funded to provide COTS
   information, rapid prototyping and research and development and/or evaluation of solutions
   for units in the field. They can provide information and research on technology and
   equipment evaluated and deemed suitable for your purpose. Additionally, they can provide
   field assessments to assist in identifying the optimal solutions to meet your requirements.

  THE ANTITERRORISM STANDARDS FOR BUILDINGS DEVIATION PROGRAM

A6.1. Deviations to Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-01 Minimum AT Standards for
Buildings. At facilities where compliance with UFC minimum AT standards for buildings
cannot be attained, or where deviation is appropriate, units will request deviation. Deviations
should not be used to avoid costs associated with compliance, but should be used where
compliance cannot be achieved.
A6.2. Overview. This program formalizes AT program risk acceptance for all facilities. The
inability to meet minimum AT standards for buildings at such facilities results in a higher AT
program risk that must be managed. Commanders must implement the AT deviation program
where resources cannot be afforded the required protection per UFC minimum AT standards for
buildings. Deviations associated with such conditions are considered permanent and require
compensatory measures.
   A6.2.1. Applicability. This program applies to the following types of facilities as indicated.
       A6.2.1.1. New Construction. Deviations from minimum UFC AT standards for buildings
       are required for all new facilities that enter the planning phase after this instruction goes
       into effect. Subordinate commands may issue stricter guidance that requires deviations
       for pre-existing construction through supplementation of this instruction.
       A6.2.1.2. Major Renovations. Deviations from minimum UFC AT standards for
       buildings are required for major renovations to existing facilities that enter the planning
       phase after this instruction goes into effect. Major renovations, modifications, repairs,
       revitalizations, and restorations are defined per UFC 4-010-01 as those whose costs
       exceed 50% of the plant replacement value of the existing building.
       A6.2.1.3. Leased Facilities. Deviations from minimum UFC AT standards for buildings
       are required for all leased facilities where DoD personnel occupy leased or assigned
       usable office area constituting at least 25% of the usable building area. This requirement
       applies to new and existing leases. While the Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum
       dated 12 July 2011 temporarily suspended UFC 4-010-01 requirements for lease renewals
       or extensions, the memorandum did not alleviate these facilities from this requirement to
       establish deviations. This is an interim situation until comparisons between DoD
       completes its assessment of DoD and interagency standards for leased space and
       determines which standards are appropriate.
A6.3. Categorizing Deviations. A deviation must first be categorized under either a UFC
minimum AT standard for buildings or a physical security standard. If a minimum UFC AT
standard for buildings is being deviated from, follow the review, approval and routing criteria
outlined in this instruction. If a Physical Security Standard is being deviated from, follow the
approval and routing criteria outlined in AFI 31-101, paragraph 6.8. Where the GCC with
TACON for FP prescribes procedures different from those prescribed above, follow the
procedures of the GCC.
A6.4. Compilation of Deviations. Consider all other deviations when requesting and approving
deviations to prevent a combination of deviations from creating an overall security problem.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                             95


Individual or compilation of deviations must not cause a greater security threat or vulnerability
than the problem they were originally designed to address.
A6.5. Documenting Deviations. Document deviations on AF Form 116, Request for Deviation
from Security Criteria, and submit each deviation for formal approval. Based on the long-term
nature and risk-tolerance level of these deviations, they must be incorporated into the AT Plan
and assigned compensatory measures in the IDP once formal approval has been granted. Do not
apply for formal approval if the directive from which you are deviating specifically states it is
not necessary.
   A6.5.1. Completing the AF Form 116.
       A6.5.1.1. The requestor of the deviation will complete blocks 1-18. If staffed
       electronically, the coordination boxes in block 15 (if used) must be completed before the
       digital signature is affixed in block 18; once the digital signature is affixed, the
       coordination boxes become locked. Once the requestor signs block 18, the AF Form 116
       is sent to the Reviewing Official. The Reviewing Official will complete blocks 19-24. If
       staffed electronically, the coordination boxes in block 21 (if used) must be completed
       before the digital signature is affixed in block 24; once the digital signature is affixed, the
       coordination boxes become locked. Once the Reviewing Official signs block 24, the AF
       Form 116 is sent to the Approval Authority.
       A6.5.1.2. The Approval Authority will complete blocks 25-32. If staffed electronically,
       the coordination boxes in block 29 (if used) must be completed before the digital
       signature is affixed in block 32; once the digital signature is affixed, the coordination
       boxes become locked. Any blocks that do not apply will be marked N/A.
       A6.5.1.3. Ensure that block 8 of the AF Form 116 includes the number of personnel
       impacted and the criticality of the facility or facility mission. In addition to the
       justification in block 9 of AF Form 116, provide a summary of the risk analysis
       performed that supports the deviation and the compensatory measures. Also within block
       9 include an impact statement should the deviation be denied. Within block 10 of AF
       Form 116, validate that the compensatory measures are resourced for the duration of the
       deviation. Within block 11 of AF Form 116, state if the corrective action proposed to
       resolve the deviation is budgeted.
   A6.5.2. Requesting Officials. Deviations from UFC minimum AT standards for buildings
   shall be requested by the chairperson of the installation ATEC (or equivalent).
   A6.5.3. Reviewing Officials. Reviewing Officials note whether compensatory measures are
   considered adequate and, if not, specify additional measures. Additionally, Reviewing
   Officials add pertinent information in block 20 to assist the Approval Authority in validating
   the request if necessary. Reviewing Official for minimum UFC AT standard for buildings
   deviations shall be the MAJCOM A7. MAJCOM A7C and/or A7P and MAJCOM ATPM
   will coordinate (at minimum).
   A6.5.4. Approval Authority. The Approval Authority accepts or declines the risk involved
   in the deviation request, approves/disapproves requests, and returns them to the requester
   with rationale for the decision. The Approval Authority for deviations from minimum UFC
   AT standards for buildings shall be the MAJCOM Vice Commander. The Approval
   authority for deviations from UFC AT Standards where the requester does not fall under the
 96                                        AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014


   MAJCOM chain of command (DRUs, FOAs, etc.) shall be the first general officer/SES in the
   operational chain of command.
       A6.5.4.1. (Added-PACAF) All requests for deviations to UFCs will be coordinated
       through the Installation ATEC and IDC with emphasis on compensatory measures and
       associated risks. Utilize the risk methodology to show what the risk is with compliance
       and without. Once coordinated, the request will be forwarded to HQ PACAF A7SA for
       review and recommendation to the HQ PACAF CV.
A6.6. Reviewing, Approving, and Disapproving Deviations.
   A6.6.1. MAJCOMs Responsibilities. MAJCOMs are responsible for the following:
       A6.6.1.1. Address the deviation approval process in MAJCOM supplements.
       A6.6.1.2. Send deviation requests involving tenant units to the tenant’s MAJCOM
       Headquarters for coordination.
       A6.6.1.3. Ensure copies of all approved deviations from minimum UFC AT standards
       for buildings are forwarded through the responsible AT office of the AF Component
       Command to the Geographic Combatant Command (GCC) with TACON FP
       responsibility for the installation requesting the deviation. Follow GCC guidance on the
       frequency and content of reporting.
       A6.6.1.4. Ensure the Installation and MAJCOM ATEC (or equivalents) review all
       deviations annually.
A6.7. Exceptions to the Deviation Program.
   A6.7.1. Pre-existing Conditions. Deviations from minimum UFC AT standards for
   buildings are only required for new facilities or major renovations to existing facilities that
   enter the planning phase after this instruction goes into effect. Major renovations,
   modifications, repairs, revitalizations, and restorations are defined per UFC 4-010-01 as
   those whose costs exceed 50% of the plant replacement value of the existing building. Note
   that this pre-existing condition exception DOES NOT apply to leased facilities.
   A6.7.2. Directed by other security instructions. Deviations from standards established in
   other physical security instructions (such as AFI 31-101) shall be requested IAW procedures
   contained in that instruction. Use these procedures only for minimum AT standards for
   buildings required by UFC 4-010-01.
A6.8. Compensating for Deviations. Compensatory measures are inherently different than
security measures normally in-place. Although different, they must provide a comparable level
of security. Security measures, facilities, equipment, and procedures that are already required
are not normally adequate as compensatory measures. Instructions consisting mainly of orders to
“increase vigilance” are inadequate. Additional forces, equipment, etc., are usually necessary to
ensure comparable security. However, there are some instances when existing forces may be
used to compensate temporarily for deviations. All Integrated Defense (ID) contributors must be
aware of deviations in their assigned areas and instruct personnel on requirements.
Compensatory measures may include the following:
   A6.8.1. Equipment, such as additional locks, intrusion detection systems (IDS), lighting, and
   barricades.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                     97


  A6.8.2. Security measures that provide the same level of protection as the security standard
  being deviated from and compensated for as a minimum.

A7.1. Acquisition of Expertise. Unjustified attempts to obtain or conduct specialized training
in security concepts, military weapons or tactics, or other unusual capabilities such as specialized
transport or handling capabilities that would cause a reasonable person to perceive a threat to
DoD personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.
A7.2. Breach or Attempted Intrusion. Unauthorized entry or attempted entry into a restricted
area or protected site; impersonation of authorized personnel (e.g., police, security, or janitorial
personnel).
A7.3. Eliciting Information. Suspicious questioning of personnel by any means about
particular DoD structures, functions, personnel, or procedures at the facility or infrastructure.
A7.4. Expressed or Implied Threat. A threat to DoD personnel or threatened damage to or
compromise of a DoD facility or infrastructure.
A7.5. Flyover or Landing. Suspicious overflight of or landing near a DoD facility or
infrastructure by any type of flying vehicle (e.g., airplane, helicopter, unmanned aerial vehicle,
glider).
A7.6. Materials Acquisition or Storage. Acquisition of unusual quantities of precursor
material (e.g., cell phones, pagers, fertilizer, fuel, and timers); unauthorized or unlicensed
individual or group attempts to obtain precursor chemicals, agents, or toxic materials; or rental of
storage units for the purpose of storing precursor material, chemicals, or apparatuses for mixing
chemicals.
A7.7. Misrepresentation. Misusing or presenting false insignia, documents, or identification or
engaging in any other activity to misrepresent one’s affiliation.
A7.8. Recruiting. Building operations teams and developing contacts, or collecting personnel

perceive a threat to DoD personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.
A7.9. Sabotage, Tampering, or Vandalism. Damaging, manipulating, or defacing part of a
DoD facility, infrastructure, or protected site. Acts of vandalism committed by DoD civilian
employees, military members, or their dependents should not be reported as suspicious activity
unless those acts relate to a pattern of criminal activity or otherwise would cause a reasonable
person to perceive a threat to DoD personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.
A7.10. Surveillance. Monitoring the activity of DoD personnel, facilities, processes, or
systems, including showing unusual interest in a facility, infrastructure, or personnel (e.g.,
observation through binoculars, taking notes, drawing maps or diagrams of the facility, and
taking pictures or video of a facility, infrastructure, personnel, or the surrounding environment)
under circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to perceive a threat to DoD personnel,
facilities, or forces in transit.
A7.11. Testing of Security. A challenge to, or a series of interactions with DoD installations,
vessels, personnel, or systems that could reveal physical, personnel, or cyber security capabilities
or vulnerabilities.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                              99


A7.12. Theft, Loss, or Diversion. Theft or loss associated with a DoD facility or infrastructure
(e.g., of badges, uniforms, identification cards, emergency vehicles, technology, or documents,
whether classified or unclassified) that are proprietary to the facility, or a diversion of attention
from a DoD facility or infrastructure that is related to a theft or loss associated with that facility.
A7.13. Weapons Discovery. Discovery of weapons or explosives, as defined in Section 930 of
Title 18, U.S.C. (Reference (n)). The discovery of personal weapons legally owned by DoD
civilian employees, military members, or their dependents should not be reported as suspicious
activity if the discovery is solely the result of the owner’s failure to properly store, register, or
secure the weapon(s).
A7.14. Unexplained Absences of International Military Students. International military
students who are unexpectedly absent from scheduled activities when the absence is without
proper authorization and lasts more than 24 hours, and an appropriate official with the host DoD
organization determines that the absence is not due to a misunderstanding in scheduling, to
sickness, or to another similar reason.
