                                    GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. General Guidance. This instruction governs the performance of USAF aviation support
for military or public events held for community relations or ceremonial purposes. It details the
procedures for event and participation approval and specifies the operational limitations of the
aviation support rendered. Air Force aerial events keep the p ublic and military informed of U.S.
preparedness, demonstrate modern weapons systems, promote good community and international
relations, support Air Force recruiting and retention efforts and render military honors. For
additional guidance on Air Force participation in public events and community relations
programs, see AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. For additional guidance on
Air Force flyovers supporting funeral or memorial events, see AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs
Program. HQ USAF/A3O may task MAJCOMs to provide assets to participate in certain key
public or military events.
1.1. (LAUGHLINAFB)General Guidance. The purpose of this supplement is to provide
guidance for or dissimilar aerial events flown by the 47 FTW, specifically the graduation retreat
ceremony flyby. Aerial events, such as the dissimilar flyby, are used to showcase LAFB’s
mission during SUPT graduation ceremonies, and to enhance Air Force recruiting and retention
by highlighting the versatility of the 47 FTW.
1.2. Public Event. Public events are community relations events not connected with the
military functioning of the Department of Defense and intended primarily for non-military
audiences. Some examples include military Open House events, ceremonies, exhibitions,
expositions, athletic contests, parades, tattoos, fairs, airshows, international airshow and trade
exhibitions, or similar programs. These events may be on- or off-base; continental United States
(CONUS) or outside of the continental United States (OCONUS). Public events can be
sponsored by either DoD or non-DoD organizations. Such events can be good community
relations and recruiting oppo rtunities. Military exercises, movements, maneuvers, or operations
are not considered public even ts merely on the basis of being incidentally observed by the
general public.
1.2. (LAUGHLINAFB)Event POCs will coordinate with 47 OSS/OSOS prior to execution
and ensure all appropriate approvals are obtained.
1.3. Military Event. A military event is an of ficial DoD event, sponsored by the DoD, a DoD
Component, or a command conducted in s upport of an assigned mission, includi ng purposes of
esprit de corps, primarily for military personnel, civil service pers onnel, dependents, and limited
guests. The event must be hosted on a facility owned, leased or operated by the DoD. In the
event a judgment needs to be made on whether an event is a military or public event, contact
SAF/PAN who will assist in the determination.
1.3. (LAUGHLINAFB)Exception to Policy Requests. Unless otherwise specified, the 47
OG/CC is the waiver authority for guidance contained in this supplement. Units forward
exceptions to policy (ETP) to this supplement through 47 OG/OGV, ―Dissimilar Flyby Program
Manager.‖

1.4. Aviation support (For Public and Military Events). Aviation support fo r public and
military events include static displays, flyovers, aerial reviews, and aerial demonstrations – these
activities are also referred to as aerial events.
     1.4.1. Static Display. Static display, a subset of aviation support, is the ground display of
     military aircraft and related equipment not involving taxiing or starting of engines while
     spectators are in the display area.
     1.4.2. Flyover. Flyover, a subset of aviation support, is a straight and level flight by a single
     military aircraft or by a formation of four or fe wer military aircraft of the same type (see
     Attachment 1 for definition of type) from the same Military Service over a predetermined
     point on the ground at a specific time and not involving aeroba tics or demonstrations;
     however, bank angles of up to 90 degrees are permissible and may be used if required to
     improve the visibility of the aircraft to the spectators. A single event will be supported with a
     single flyover only (IAW DoDD 5410.18)—this restriction does not apply to public airshows
     or to military open house events. For multiple flyovers and multiple passes, see Attachment
     1. Flyovers of public events in support of community relations activities may only be flown
     as adjuncts to approved training missions.
        1.4.2.1. An approved funeral or memorial service may be supported with the missing
        man formation (see paragraph 3.6.2.4 and 4.2.3).
        1.4.2.2. Dissimilar Formation Flyover. A dissimilar formation is a single -element
        formation of four or fewer aircraft of multiple Mission Design Series (MDS) of the same
        type (see Attachment 1 for definition of type) from the same Military Service. A
        dissimilar formation flyover is not to be confused with an aerial review. An example of a
        dissimilar formation would be a two-, three-, or four-ship formation involving F-16s and
        F-15s. Formations in volving variants of an MDS, for example a formation of F-16A, F-
        16C, F-16D fighters, is not cons idered dissimilar. A dissimilar formation flyover should
        be undertaken only with applicable consideration given to safety, to the compatible flying
        characteristics of the aircraft involved, and to the overall theme of the event that is being
        supported.
     1.4.3. Aerial Review. Aerial review, a subset of aviation support, is a flyover of more than
     four aircraft, or of multiple types (see Attachment 1 for definition) of aircraft, or of aircraft
     representing more than one Military Service or Nation, regardless of horizontal and timing
     separation of flying elements. It may have elements in trail formation and will not involve
     precision maneuvers or demonstrations. The elements of the aerial review may be individual
     aircraft, formations, or a combination of individual aircraft and formations.
        1.4.3.1. Aerial reviews are reserved only for the mo st meaningful national or
        international occasions and shall not be performed at CONUS public events without
        approval by OASD/PA. OCONUS approval will comply with COCOM directives.
        1.4.3.2. Multiple Aerial Events S upporting a Single Public Event. From the public af
        fairs perspective an aerial review flown for a given event constitutes a significant AF
        statement of support; so too does performing multiple aerial events in combination for a
        single public event. To ensure an appropriate level of scrutiny and approval, the
        performing of multiple aerial events (for example, multiple flyovers) in comb ination for
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                               9


       a single public event requires event and participation approval levels comparable to aerial
       rev iew approval levels. This criterion applies to the following:
           1.4.3.2.1. Multiple flyovers at the same event, regard less of timing separation
           between the flyover aircraft or formations.
           1.4.3.2.2. The combination of an Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT) airdrop and a
           flyover at a single event.
NOTE: As distinctly diverse assets, this combination will not be performed at public events
without approval by SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3O.
       1.4.3.3. The definition of aerial revi ew does not apply to the Air Force vintage aircraft
       program (Heritage/Texan Flights), unless flown in conjunction with other assets outside
       of the vintage aircraft program.
       1.4.3.4. (Added-AETC) An aerial review may be flown as di ssimilar formation with
       the appropriate approval (Table A2.1 (Added)).
       1.4.3.5. (Added-AETC) Aerial reviews using aircraft from other armed forces services
       or other nations require approval from th e owning services or nation, all participating
       major command (MAJCOM) commanders, SAF/PAC, and HQ USAF /A3O. Aerial
       reviews using only aircraft from AETC require Numbered Air Force Commander
       (NAF/CC) approval after appropriate event approval.
       1.4.3.6. (Added-AETC) The mission commander (MC) or pi lot in command (PIC)
       must complete and submit to NAF/A3O the following:
           1.4.3.6.1. (Added-AETC) AETC Form 63, Aerial Event Plan of Execution.
           1.4.3.6.2. (Added-AETC) DELETED
           1.4.3.6.3. (Added-AETC) All Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) waivers
           and/or approvals.
           1.4.3.6.4. (Added-AETC) All requests, approvals, and waiver s from other services,
           nations, or MAJCOMs participating in the event in formation with AETC aircraft.
           OG/CC may approve practice sorties over home station. NAF/CC approves practice
           sorties flown away from station location.
       1.4.3.7. (Added-AETC) AETC aircraft will not fly f ormation sorties or missions with c
       ivilian aircraft or aircraft flown by civilians. (EXCEPTION: Fly heritage flights
       according to the applicable volume of AFI 11-246, Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations.)
       AETC will not perform heritage flights if a demonstration or her itage flight team for the
       specific aircraft exists in another MAJCOM. If heritage flight guidance does not exis t,
       submit a unique aerial event request, on AETC Form 63, through NAF/A3O to HQ
       USAF/A3O.
   1.4.4. Aerial Demonstrations. Aerial demonstration, a subset of aviation support, includes
   virtually every type of aerial participation by fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft in public or
   military events (except aerial review and flyover). See Attachment 1 for a list of example
   activities that meet the definition of Aerial Demonstrations. Aerial demonstration is
   synonymous with the phrases aerial demo, aircraft demonstration (demo), aircraft capabilities
   demonstration (demo), and aircraft capabilities exercise (CAPEX). The AFI 1 1-246, Air
 10                       AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012


   Force Aircraft Demonstrations, series specify policy for aerial demonstrations (to include
   demonstration teams), demonstration profiles for certain aircraft and the procedures for non-
   standard profile approval. Training events incidentally observed by the general public are not
   considered to be aerial demonstrations. See paragraphs 3.6.4 and 4.4 for specific procedures
   on aerial demonstration approval.
NOTE: Guidance in paragraphs 1.4.1. through 1.4.4. is not intended to limit aviation support at
public airshows or military Open House even ts – these events may be supported with multip le
static displays, multiple flyovers (with multiple passes) and multiple aerial demonstrations, all
approved IAW the normal procedures in this instr uction for event and partic ipation approval.
Additionally, multiple aerial e vents supporting two or more separate events at a single
geographic location in a single day can be authorized IAW the normal procedures in this
instruction (for example: a flyover for a USAFA graduation ceremony and a funeral flyover at
the USAF A cemetery, both at approximately the same time). Each event must stand on its own,
and be comp letely independent (limitations specified in paragraph 1.4.2. apply to each separate
event).
   1.4.4. (AETC) Units will adhere to the maneuvers author ized in the appropriate volume of
   AFI 11-246, AFI 11-209, and this supplement.
       1.4.4.1. (Added-AETC) Units must submit AETC Form 63 for approval by NAF/CC
       for all aerial demonstrations covered by AFI 11-209 and this supplement. Refer to Table
       A2.1 (Added) and Table A4.1 (Added) for further guidance.
       1.4.4.2. (Added-AETC) Only AETC aircraft pilots certified according to AFI 11-246,
       Volume 2; AFI 11-209; and this supplement will perform aerial demonstrations.
       1.4.4.3. (Added-AETC) The MC or PIC must complete and submit to NAF/A3O the
       following:
           1.4.4.3.1. (Added-AETC) AETC Form 63.
           1.4.4.3.2. (Added-AETC) DELETED
           1.4.4.3.3. (Added-AETC) Upon request, all FAA waivers and/or approvals.
           1.4.4.3.4. (Added-AETC) All requests, approvals, and waiver s from other services,
           nations, or MAJCOMs participating with AETC aircraft in the flight formation.
       1.4.4.4. (Added-AETC) AETC aircraft will not fly f ormation sorties or missions with c
       ivilian aircraft or aircraft flown by civilians. (EXCEPTION: Fly heritage flights
       according to the applicable volume of AFI 11-246.) AETC will not perform heritage
       flights if a demonstration or heritage flight team for the specific aircraft exists in another
       MAJCOM. If heritage flight guidance does not exist, submit a unique aerial event
       request, on AETC Form 63, through NAF/A3O to HQ USAF/A3O.
       1.4.4.5. (Added-AETC) NAF/CC is the approval authority fo r AETC precision
       parachute demonstration teams or qualified parachute-jumpers to perform parachute
       jumps or demonstrations at all aerial events. Jumpers from other than AETC units require
       approval from their MAJCOM and NAF/CC to jump from an AETC aircraft. Use AETC
       Form 63 to submit a request to NAF/A3O to use an AETC aircraft as a jump platform at
       least 45 days prior to the event. (See AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations, for
       additional procedures for jumper demonstrations.)
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                                 11


1.5. Approvals. Aviation support at public an d military events requ ires both a determ ination
of event approval from Public Af fairs and participation appr oval from Operations. This
instruction outlines the required levels of approval (event and participation) for aerial events at
public or military events. For some events, eligibility has been predetermined by Public Affairs
and requires only Operations participation approval; see Chapter 3 for specific event approval
requirements and Chapter 4 for specific participation approval requirements. USAF aviation
support not described in this instruction but planned for a public or military event must re ceive
MAJCOM, HQ USAF/A3O, and SA F/PA approval before the performance. For events outside
of the United States, Canada and Mexico, approval will comply with COCOM directives and
paragraphs 5.9 through 5.10.
1.5. (AETC) Approvals. See Table A2.1 (Added) and Table A4.1 (Added) for the level of
event and participation approval for each aerial event. Note: The information in these table s is
in addition to the guidance provided in Chapter 3, Chapter 4, and Attachment 2 of the basic
publication.
   1.5.1. (Added-AETC) An aerial event is any flyover, static display, airdrop, weapons
   demonstration or event that is not performed for student or permanent party training, airlift,
   or orientation flights by AETC aircraft or personnel in s upport of military events, public ev
   ents, or community relations programs.
   1.5.2. (Added-AETC) The overall success of AETC aerial ev ent support requires
   teamwork, communication, and coordination among HQ USAF, SAF/PAC; HQ AETC,
   NAF, and each AETC flying unit.
1.6. Operational Criteria. Safety must be the prime consideration at all times. Do not engage
in activities that compromise the safety of spectators or that could damage or destroy property.
Participation by any air refueling aircraft in a flyover or aerial review shall not be conducted with
the receiver closer than the precontact position.
NOTE: The Thunderbirds Demonstration Team, MAJCOM Single Ship Demonstration Teams,
aviation record setting flights, and USAF vintage aircraft programs (such as the Heritage Flight
Texan Flight programs) will use operational criteria provided in their own approved Air Force or
MAJCOM instructions; all other Air Force aircraft participating in aerial events will use the
criteria presented in this paragraph.
   1.6.1. Showmanship and Professionalism. Aerial events have many objectives among which
   are to entertain the spectators and to inform the general public on Air Force capabilities. In
   planning and performing aerial events, supervisors, pilots, ai rcrew members and all other
   participants should remember the objective is to de monstrate Air Force professionalism and
   competence to the general public. Strict compliance with show lines, flying procedures, and
   minimum altitude restrictions reflect a high degree of professionalism and contribute
   markedly to great showmanship.
   1.6.2. Weather Minimums. Weather must allow operations under Visual Flight Rules (VFR)
   in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules, and applicable AFI 11-
   2MDS, Volume 3, MDS Specific Operations Procedures. Weather minimums are ―flyover
   minimum altitude‖ plus 500 feet and 3 miles visibility. The MAJCOM or mission
   commander may set higher minimums based on the nature of the event, local terrain, or other
   factors.
12                      AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012


  1.6.2. (AETC) The minimum ceiling and visibi lity for all flyovers in AETC is 2,500-foot
  ceilings and a 5-mile visibility. If ceiling and visibility are below the minimums, the MC or
  PIC will cancel participation. (EXCEPTION: MMFs using a four ship pullup formation re
  quire a minimum of a 5,000-foot ceiling and a 5-mile visibility.) These requirements will not
  be waived to lower the minimums; however, commanders, MCs, and PICs may specify
  higher minimums at any time.
  1.6.3. Altitude Minimums. The minimum altitudes published in AFI 11-202 and in Federal
  Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations for congested and non-congested areas apply. If
  the venue for an event is on a riverbank with a show line or flyover ground track over water
  or over the opposite bank, treat this location for a flyover as a congested area since spectators
  can congregate on both sides of the river. If the venue for an event is on the shore of the
  ocean, large bay, or large lake with a show line or flyover ground track over the open water,
  treat this location for a flyover as a non-congested area.
  1.6.3. (AETC) All flyovers, aerial reviews, or tattoos performed by AETC aircraft during
  any aerial event are considered flights over a congested area. The minimum al titude for
  AETC aircraft is 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL) a bove the highest obstacle within
  2,000 feet of the aircraft. EXCEPTION: AETC-assigned helicopters may perform flyovers
  at 500 feet AGL above the highest obstacle within 2,000 feet of the aircraft.
     1.6.3.1. USAF Minimum Altitudes. In certain cases , such as demonstration team
     performances, approved maneuver packages, and en try and exit into flyover areas, the
     FAA may specifically waive the altitude r equirements below. Even if the FAA
     authorizes a lower altitude, USAF controlled aircraft must not be flown lower than the
     following minimum altitudes: 1.6.3.1.1. 500 feet AGL for fixed-wing aircraft.
         1.6.3.1.1. (AETC) The NAF/CC may approve lower altit udes for fixed-wing
         aircraft (down to 500 feet AGL) if the MC or PIC obtains appropriate FAA waivers
         and approvals. (EXCEPTION: Altitude waivers will not be approved for flyovers at
         locations where high concentrations of birds exist, such as over large bodies of water
         or near migratory bird routes. Fly all AETC aircraft at 1,000 AGL in such locations.)
         The MC or PIC informs the Current Operations Division (NAF/A3O) of all flyover
         altitudes.
         1.6.3.1.2. MAJCOMs are authorized to establish altitudes lower than the minimums
         specified in paragraph 1.6.3.1.1 for operating rotary wing aircraft in the execution of
         approved aircraft demonstration profiles, when the lower altitudes are necessary to
         properly demonstrate capabilities. Each MAJCOM sets minimum altitudes for the
         safe operation of their assets.
  1.6.4. Airspeed Limitations. Airspeed guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 3 applies to all aerial
  events. The minimum airspeed for the operation of any fixed wing AF aircraft participating
  in any military or civilian event is stall speed plus 30 percent for the aircraft configuration.
  Airlift aircraft used in demonstrating standard, approved tactical procedures such as assault
  takeoffs or assault landings, may be flown at lower airspeeds, but not at airspeeds lower than
  specified in technical order publications. Maximum airspeed is limited to .90 MACH, or a
  lower airspeed if stipulated in a governing FAA waiver, for all aerial demonstrations except
  for approved record flights and demonstration teams. Demonstration teams will use a
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                             13


  maximum speed of .95 MACH. FAA waiver may be required for airspeeds above 250kts
  below 10,000 MSL.
  1.6.4. (AETC) When units are flying afterburner -equipped aircraft, avoid using
  afterburners unless required for safety of flight or MMF pullups. Units must use AE TC
  Form 63 to request NAF/CC approval for any other planned use of afterburners.
  1.6.5. Time Limitations. Due to safety concerns and reduced public relations benefit, aerial
  events are authorized only between the beginning of Morning Civil Twilight and the end of
  Evening Civil Twilight. The USAF Academy W ings of Blue parachute team is authorized an
  exception to this policy provided a FAA waiver (FAA Form 7711-2, Certificate of Waiver
  or Authorization Application) is obtained for each night jump in accordance with 14 Code
  of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 105.21.
  1.6.6. Communications. Aerial Control Teams (ACT) and on-site ground supervisors should
  use discrete radio frequencies to control aviation assets.
  1.6.7. Spectator Area. The event organizer for aerial demonstrations must set up a designated
  spectator area safely separated from the area over which the aerial demonstrations will
  occur—safety is always a primary consideration in selecting the spectator area and in
  establishing the show line for flight operations. Official observers and spectators must stay
  within their designated area. Aircraft conducting demonstrations at military or civilian events
  will not over-fly the designated spectator area unless specifically granted a waiver by F AA
  and the parent MAJCOM. The event or ganizer must ensure a 1,500-foot minimum distance
  exists between the spectator area and the show line for all military aircraft demonstrations.
  Under the following circumstances, the 1,500-foot minimum distance can be reduced to the
  following:
  1.6.7. (AETC) Show-lines waiver requires FAA Form 7711-1, Certificate of Waiver or
  Authorization, and NAF/CC approval. See Figure 1.1 (Added) for a show and crowd line
  diagram.

      1.6.7.1. To 1,200 feet between the spectator area a nd the show line if the F AA grants
      such a waiver and if the parent MAJCOM approves.
      1.6.7.2. To 1,000 feet between the spectator area and the show line for T-6 Texan II
      demonstrations.
      1.6.7.3. To 1,000 feet between the spectator area and the intended airdrop impact point
      or the drop zone boundary (whichever is greater) for the following tactical airdrop
      demonstrations:
      1.6.7.3. (AETC) Do not perform personnel or equipment drops if the flightpath of the
      airdrop aircraft is over or behind spectator stands or congested areas near the drop zone. (
      EXCEPTION: High altitude low opening [HALO] pa rachutist airdrops.) If the rele ase
      point or flightpath of the airdrop aircraft is within 100 yards of the viewing stands, cancel
      the airdrop or adjust the point of impact.
         1.6.7.3.1. Equipment
         1.6.7.3.2. Container Delivery System
         1.6.7.3.3. Personnel using round canopies
      1.6.7.4. To 500 feet between the spectator area and the show line for a helicopter
      operational demonstration and for fixed-wing assault landing or assault takeoff
      demonstrations.

       1.6.7.7. To 50 feet between the spectator area and th e landing target for the airdrop of
       precision parachute demonstration teams (for example, the Wings of Blue) when
       steerable square main and reserve canopies are used. The airdrop may include a High
       Altitude Low Opening (HALO) demonstration.
   1.6.8. (Added-AETC) Other Flyovers. All other flyovers pe rformed at nonairshow or open
   house events should not be flown directly over large crowds of people. The MC or PIC
   should offset the fly-over track over the crowd whenever possible while maintaining
   horizontal separation of all obstacles. See Figure 1.2 (Added) for further guidance.

Figure 1.2. (Added-AETC) Show Areas for Offset Flyovers.




1.7. Compliance with Flight Procedures. For aircraft operations outside the United States,
comply with host nation air rules and procedures and with the USAF Foreign Clearance Guide.
Coordinate with host nation Air Traffic Control representatives before an over flight of a foreign
country. For air operations in the United States, comply with all FAA rules and instructions.
1.8. Waiver Process. For situations that require waivers to FAA regulations and AF
instructions, obtain the FAA waiver before staf fing the AF waiver request. Obtain the FAA
waiver and determinations on FAA policy through the local Flight Standards District Office. 1.9
Force Protection. The safety of Air Force personnel and th e protection of Air Force aircraft and
equipment are paramount. Force protection measures should always be taken into consideration,
whether participating in flyovers, aerial de monstrations, and aerial reviews, or conducting static
displays. It is imperative that all Air Force members at all levels become situationally aware of
potential threats to Air Force personnel and equipment when deciding to participate in any milit
ary or civilian event. Refer to AFMAN 31-201, Volume 3, Flight Operations; AFI 31-101, The
Air Force Installation Security Program; and AFI 10-1004, Conducting Air Force Open Houses
(when published) for force protection considerations – this must be reviewed for applicability
prior to planning a base open house.

1.9. (AETC) Force Protection. NAF/A3O will coordinate with Air Force Office of Special
Investigations (AFOSI) and AETC units to ensure force prot ection security checks are
performed at all civilian events when events dictate the need for extra security of Air Force
assets or when directed by higher headquarters (HHQ).
   1.9.1. (Added-AETC) The list of AETC pre-approved routin e use airfields and remain
   over night (RON) approval status is found at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
   af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=-2061181&command=org . The list provides
   basic inform ation about each location, its RON status, and the AETC base res ponsible for
   the letter of agreem ent. Joint-use airfields approved for RON at the civil side fixed base
   operator (FBO) of joint-use airfields are also listed. These airfields may be used for RON
   during cross-country missions, to include stops en route to approved aerial event locations
   (such as airshows, static displays, flyovers, etc.).
   1.9.2. (Added-AETC) If an airfield is not on the AETC pre-approved list, aircrews will not
   RON at the civil side FBO of a joint-use airfield without OG/CC approval. The OG/CC, or
   equivalent, may approve a one time RON at the civil side of a joint-use field not on the pre-
   approved AETC list provided the following criteria are met:
       1.9.2.1. (Added-AETC) Controlled entry. Is there a point of controlled entry, or similar
       means to prevent unauthorized entry to the airfield or aircraft?
       1.9.2.2. (Added-AETC) Surveillance. Is there a form of surveillance capability used 24
       hours a day, 7 days a week (periodic manned patrols, video monitoring, etc.)?
       1.9.2.3. (Added-AETC) Law Enforcement or Security Response Processes. Are there
       processes to ensure law enforcement or other security respons e in the event of an airfield
       or aircraft intrusion?
   1.9.3. (Added-AETC) OG/CC or equivalent, may also approve aircrews to RON at a
   civilian airfield not on the AETC pre-approved list when the airfield is hosting an approved
   aerial event and the OG/ CC verifies the security criteria of paragraphs 1.9.2.1 (Added),
   1.9.2.2 (Added), and 1.9.2.3 (Added). If the aerial event location do es not meet these
   criteria, th e aircraft may support the event but must RON at another suitable aerodrome
   which meets the security criteria, with OG/CC approval.
   1.9.4. (Added-AETC) Circumstances could arise necessitating a change to the RON
   approval status, it is imperative aircrews check the Web site (see paragraph 1.9.1 (Added))
   for changes prior to planning the RON at an AETC-routine use civil airfield, at the civil side
   of a joint-use airfield, or an aerial event location.

                              EVENT APPROVAL PROCESS

3.1. General Approval Process. Air Force participation in any event requires approval from
Public Affairs and Operations. Public Af fairs is concerned with the appropria teness of an event
for Air Force involvement. Operational approval is concerned with operational issues. For public
events outside the United States, Canada and Mexico, the combatant commander has authority
over the approval and participation in events within the command’s Area of Responsibility
(AOR). In this case, comply with combatant command directives and utilize this chapter as
general guidance for the event. See paragraph 5.9 for additional requirements for overseas
events.
3.1. (AETC) General Approval Process. See Table A2.1 (Added) and Table A4.1 (Added)
for the level of event and participation approval for each aerial event. Note: The information in
these tables charts is in addition to guidance provided in Attachment 2 of the basic publication.
3.2. Public Event Approval. Civilian sponsors of public events in the United States, Canada
and Mexico seeking Air Force aviation s upport must request event approval from SAF/PA using
DD Form 2535, Request for Military Aerial Support. Military sponsors of public events are also
required to send the DD Form 2535 (except as noted in paragraph 3.2.2) through their
MAJCOM/PA to SAF/PA with as much lead time as possible (usually a minimum of 45 days),
before any Air Force asset can participate in their events. SAF/PA evaluates the information in
the DD Form 2535 to determine the eligibility of the events specified for the aviation support
requested us ing the guidance found in DoD Directive 5410.18, DoD Instruction 5410.19, AFI
35-101, and other applicable publications and instructions. For a comprehensive discussion on
the DD Form 2535 or to obtain a copy, see the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site
(http://www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil/) and select ―Request Procedur es.‖ Civilian sponsors
seeking aviation support (flyovers or AFP T demos) for public events that directly support
commemorations of patriotic holidays are still required to submit a DD Form 2535. Civilian or
military sponsors who seek Air Force aviation support for public events planned outside the
United States, Canada and Mexico will comply with COCOM directives to obtain event appr
oval. The DD Form 2535 may be submitted to MAJCOM/PA (in lieu of SAF/PA) for events that
involve only static display, or when the ev ents directly support the commemoration of a
Patriotic Holiday (i.e., not in conjunction with a sporting event; see paragraph 3.6.2.1.1).
3.2. (AETC) Public Event Approval. All event points of contact (POC) for on-base or off-
base aerial events must send a co mpleted DD Form 2535, Request for Military Aerial Support,
to SAF/PAC, HQ AETC Public Affairs (HQ AETC/PA), or the wing PA depending on event
approval level. DD Form 2535 is not required for funeral, memorial for a person, or unit-hosted
memorial service (UHMS) flyovers. See Table A2.1 (Added) and Table A4.1 (Added) for
further guidance. Note: Ensure the FAA completes Section IV of DD Form 2535 if there is any
flying at the event.
   3.2.1. SAF/PA determines eligibility, IAW DoD and AF policy, for the following:
       3.2.1.1. Aviation-related events (aviation shows, aviation fairs, aviation expositions,
       airport dedications, events primarily designed to encourage the advancement of aviation,
       and civic events that contribute to the public knowledge of Armed Forces aviation
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                             29


     equipment and capabilities)—SAF/ PA processes event approval re quests for aviation-
     related public events IAW standing, internal procedures and posts notificat ion of those
     approved to the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site.
     3.2.1.2. Non-aviation related events (e.g., professional/amateur sports, community
     relations events, parades, festivals, etc.)—SAF/PA processes event approval for non-
     aviation related public events IAW Exception-to-Policy (ETP) procedures. The ETP
     process involves the HQ USAF/A3 community as well as SAF/PA and is outlined in
     paragraph 3.5. ETP approvals are granted only when participation is determined to be in
     the best interest of the USAF. Event sponsors should follow the ETP procedures posted
     on the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site when requesting event approval for
     non-aviation related events. The DD Form 2535 and ETP documentation should reach
     SAF/PA 45 days in advance of the event’s date. Forms received within 14 days of an
     event are generally not considered for support.
  3.2.2. Approved Military-Sponsored Public Events . The following on-ba se public events
  are approved for Air Force av iation support and need no further P ublic Affairs approval.
  Operations approval (i.e., participation approval) for the type of aviation support planned for
  these events is still required.
     3.2.2.1. Military open house even ts. A DD Form 2535 is required for DoD
     demonstration team requests. A copy must be forwarded through MAJCOM/PA to
     SAF/PA for consolidation, prioritization and posting.
     3.2.2.2. USAF Academy flyovers. See Chapter 5 for procedures.
     3.2.2.3. The National Guard Academy of Military Science flyovers.
  3.2.3. (Added-AETC) Units must submit an email request to NAF/A3O to participate in
  most aerial events. (See Table A2.1 (Added) and Table A4.1 (Added) for further guidance.)
  NAF/A3O will return a slot confirmation to the unit. The event POC has final authority on
  which aircraft will support their respective events. Units will not use the SAF/ PAC Web site
  links to sign up for an aerial event until NAF/A3O has sent the slot confirmation.
     3.2.3.1. (Added-AETC) This includes airshows and aerial events. The following
     guidance applies:
         3.2.3.1.1. (Added-AETC) AETC units are encouraged to pl an for an annual
         airshow. Early decisions on dates will ensure the best chances of procuring
         demonstration teams. Note: Refer to AFI 35-101 and AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft
         Landing Permits, for procedures on requesting the Air Force Thunderbirds demo
         team, Navy Blue Angels, Army Golden Knights, Canadian Snowbirds, and civilian
         aircraft support.
         3.2.3.1.2. (Added-AETC) Units submit a DD Form 2535 fo r all aviation su pport
         requests from the military service demonstration teams to HQ A ETC/PA by 1 July
         for the following year’s events. HQ AETC/PA will forward the request to SAF/PAC
         for approval.
         3.2.3.1.3. (Added-AETC) Units request other airshow support by message, email,
         or facsimile to NAF/A3O and HQ AETC/PAC NLT 45 days before the event.

          Coordinate with the wing public affairs office and NAF/A3O throughout a ll stages of
          open house planning and execution.
          3.2.3.1.4. (Added-AETC) Event POC will inform SAF/PAC and NAF/A3O of all
          approved AETC events to include date of the event; even t title or theme; eve nt POC,
          to include telephone number and email; location; runway length; and crowd size.
          3.2.3.1.5. (Added-AETC) AETC units should support othe r AETC units’ air shows
          to the maximum extent possible.
          3.2.3.1.6. (Added-AETC) IAW AFI 10-1001, the Directorate of Operations (HQ
          AETC/A3) is the approval authority for ci vilian fly-ins and civil aerial de
          monstrations at AETC bases. Unit commanders ensure all hold-harmless agr eements
          are processed by the unit judge advocate (JA) prior to the event. AETC airshow ev
          ents POCs submit civil fly-in requests through the Airfield Operations Branch (HQ
          AETC /A3OF) to HQ AETC/A3 according to AFI 10-1001. Event POCs will submit
          civil aerial demonstration requests through HQ AETC/PA according to AFI 35-101.
          3.2.3.1.7. (Added-AETC) The Wing/Installation commander is the approval
          authority for temporary airfield design criteria waivers and airfield restrictions
          necessary to support air shows. This authority is conveyed in UFC 3-260-01,
          paragraph A2.2.3.4. Coordinate air show waiver requests with AM, TERPS, airspace
          management, OG/CC, aircraft maintenance and communications. Provide information
          copies of the signed waiver to AETC/A7CPP for appropriate headquarters
          distribution.
3.3. Military Event Approval. Military event approval rests with the MAJCOM hosting the
event or as specified in DoD policy.
   3.3.1. Approved Military Events. The following military events are approved for Air Force
   aviation support IAW current DoD and AF Public Affairs policy and need no further Public
   Affairs coordination. Operations approval (i.e., participation approval) for the type of aviati
   on support planned for these events is still required. A pproval for military events does no t
   constitute approval for an aerial review (see paragraphs 1.4.3., 3.6.3., and 4.3 for aerial
   review criteria, restrictions and approval levels).
   3.3.1. (AETC) Other Approved On-base Military Events. The WG/CC may approve a
   memorial fly-over over home station for deceased members, military or civilian, assigned to
   the unit’s home station. Flights can be performed only over the unit’ s home station. IAW the
   basic AFI, AETC/A3 is the approval authority for using MMF. Units must notify NAF/A3O
   when these or other flights are flown under AFI 11-209, paragraph 3.3 See Table A2.1
   (Added) for AETC approval requirements. Note: Reference paragraph 3.6.2.4 for missing
   man guidance.
      3.3.1.1. On-base patriotic observances (see paragraph 3.6.2.1 for off-base criteria).
      3.3.1.2. Retirement ceremonies and change of command ceremonies (see paragraph
      3.6.2.2 for criteria).
      3.3.1.2. (AETC) See Table A2.1 (Added) for AETC approval authorities.
      3.3.1.3. Funeral or memorial events (see paragraph 3.6.2.3 for criteria).
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                                31


       3.3.1.4. On-base unit change of aircraft and unit flag retirement ceremonies.
       3.3.1.5. The installation commander may deem other on-base mili tary events eligible
       based on the contribution such events make to fostering esprit de corps, military values
       and patriotism, and on their ability to stand the test of public scrutiny. Examples of other
       eligible events are: military graduation ceremonies, retreat ceremonies, memo rial
       ceremonies, and military parades. MAJ-COMs have the authority to approv e flyovers or
       jump platform aircraft by their assigned operational aircraft in support of approved events
       on their respective command bases.
   3.3.2. Disapproved Military Events. The following military events or cere monies are not
   approved for Air Force aviation support IA W current DoD and AF policy: off-base
   retirement ceremonies, off-base change of command ceremonies, off-base unit flag
   retirement ceremonies, and off-base unit change of aircraft ceremonies.
3.4. SAF/PA Approval Process. Once SAF/PA determines an event appropriate for Air Force
aviation support, it is posted to the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site (
http://www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil/) as an ―Eligible Event.‖ This is the primary means SAF/PA
uses to communicate with event sponsors and military flying units and/ or AF parachute
demonstration teams on event approval. Being declared eligible does not mean Air Force
―participation approval‖ has been granted (this is an Operations consideration) or that a unit has
volunteered to provide the event aviation support.
   3.4.1. Units wishing to volunteer to s upport an event must indicate their intent on the
   website or via telephone to SAF/PAN. Event sponsors may contact units to solicit aviation
   support for their events.
       3.4.1.1. Units volunteering for any ETP event must notify SA F/PAN and MAJCOM of
       their intent to support not late r than 7 days prio r to the event (normally 14 days prior or
       earlier). All events that do not have a volunteer unit will be removed from the web site 7
       days prior and will not be considered for support. Units must also coordinate with event
       sponsors.
       3.4.1.2. MAJCOMs may require a unit to volunteer via MAJCOM rather than directly
       with SAF/ PAN (see MAJCOM supplement to this instruction).
   3.4.2. SAF/PA and SAF/IA, in turn, are the approval authorities for events planned
   specifically for a foreign dignitary, to include the type and level of aviation support that is
   appropriate. Event sponsors are to submit requests at least 45 calendar days in advance.
3.5. Exception-to-Policy Procedures for Public Events. Public events for which ETP
procedures apply must be evaluated and approved by both SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3O;
participation approval is delegated to the MAJCOMs for the avia tion support that appr oved
ETP events a re ultimately rendered (see Chapter 4). The event sponsor initiates the ETP
process by submitting a DD Form 2535 to SAF/PA IAW procedures listed in AFI 35-101,
Chapter 8, and the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site. The following procedures
outline the ET P approval process fo r public events unless aviation related (IA W paragraph
3.2.1.1) or in direct support of a Patriotic Holiday.
   3.5.1. Annually HQ USAF/A3O and SAF/PA will release a joint message, categorizing as
   depicted below, the events for the coming year for which event sponsors are requesting ETP
 32                      AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012


   event approval. The message will assign th e level of aviation support considered appropriate
   for selected events by name and for other events by category.
      3.5.1.1. Category 1 (Cat 1). Events designated Cat 1 will be listed by even t name and
      are automatically granted event approval—they are of such importance that every ef fort
      will be taken to support them. Aviation support is pre-approved up to a four-ship
      formation. Volunteer units will be solicited—if no units volunteer, HQ USAF/A3O will
      coordinate with appropriate MAJCOMs and task selected units for aviati on support.
      Relatively few ETP even ts will fall into Cat 1 (some examples are the Super Bowl, the
      Rose Bowl, the Indianapolis 500, etc.).
      3.5.1.2. Category 2 (Cat 2). Events designated Cat 2 will be li sted by general classes
      of events, such as a specific sport or events for which Air Force Recrui ting Service has a
      sponsorship role. As events are placed in Cat 2, they are granted event appr oval and
      aviation support is pre-approved up to a four-ship formation. Cat 2 events are supported
      by volunteer units and typically will not be tasked.
      3.5.1.3. Category 3 (Cat 3). Events not identified under Cat 1 or 2 fall into Cat 3.
      SAF/P A and HQ USAF/A3O will jointly de termine if a given Cat 3 event war rants
      event approval and, if approved, will specify an appropriate type and level of aviation
      support (e.g., 4-ship, 2-ship, sin-gle-ship, etc.). Approved Cat 3 events are to be
      supported by volunteer units and typically will not be tasked.
   3.5.2. Events approved under one of the categories above are considered to have ETP event
   approval and are posted to the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site. HQ
   USAF/A3O delegates participation approval to MAJCOM/A3 for events approved under the
   above categories. MAJCOM/A3 will ensure that the volunteer unit will support the event as
   an addition to an approved training mission and that the support rendered wi ll pass the test
   of public scrutiny (i.e. training accomplished, impact to operations, proximity of event to the
   base, additional support requirements, and wing commander support). Once participation
   approval is granted, the MAJCOM/A 3 office responsible for aerial events will inform HQ
   USAF/A3OO NLT two working days prior to the event. Notification will include at a
   minimum the participation approval, unit, type, and number of supporting aircraft.
3.6. Specific Aviation Support for Public or Military Events -Event Approval
Considerations. The following paragraphs outline add itional guidance bearing on the even t
approval process (see Approval Matrix in Attachment 2).
   3.6.1. Static Display. Events for which static displays are requested require Public Affairs
   event approval or as delegated in AFI 35-101, Chapter 8. Refer to paragraph 3.6.2.2 for
   Retirement or Change of Command ceremony criteria.
   3.6.2. Flyover. In general, an event for which a flyover is requested requires Public Af fairs
   event approval IAW paragraphs 3.2 through 3.5 above, except as noted below.
      3.6.2.1. Off-Base Patriotic Holiday. As a matter of DoD and Air Force policy, aviation
      support in the form of flyovers (or AFPT demonstrations) is authorized for off-base
      patriotic observances, i.e., commemorative events held in support of patr iotic holidays.
      Such events must be evaluated by at least MAJCOM/PA prior to receiving aviation
      support to ensure compliance with governing policies and procedures. The
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                                33


     commemorative event for which the flyover (or AFPT demonstration) is performed must
     occur within seven days of the national day of observance of the holiday.
        3.6.2.1.1. The commemorative event for which the flyover (or AF PT demonstration)
        is performed must directly support the patriotic holiday. Non-commemorative events
        merely falling within seven days of the national days of observance for the applicable
        holidays are not eligible for flyovers (or AFPT demonstrations), unless approved by
        SAF/PA through normal procedures. An example of a non-commemorative event
        would be a sporting event held on or near Independence Day, even one with a solemn
        ceremony or moment of silence.
        3.6.2.1.2. See paragraph 3.6.2.4 for guidance on use of the Mi ssing Man Formation
        at patriotic observances.
        3.6.2.1.3. The event sponsor must submit a completed DD Form 2535 to
        MAJCOM/PA or SAF/PA, where it is reviewed to ensure the event is actually a
        commemorative event suitable for Air Force participation. Local bases receiving DD
        Forms 2535 should forward them through their MAJCOM/PA and on to SAF/PA, if
        applicable.
     3.6.2.2. Retirement/Change of Command Ceremony. Flyovers or aerial reviews for
     of f-base retirement or change of command ceremonies are not per mitted. Ceremonies
     eligible for aerial support, if they are held on-base, are approved only for the following
     personnel as noted below:
        3.6.2.2.1. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) or any combatant commander
        is authorized an aerial review. Air Force participation in COCOM multi-service or
        multi-national aerial reviews is approved. MAJCOMs will provide an information
        copy to HQ USAF/A3O containing the number and type of aircraft participating.
        3.6.2.2.2. The Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (VCSAF), a MAJCOM/CC or a
        State Adjutant General is authorized a flyover by a single formation (up to four-ship).
        3.6.2.2.3. A MAJCOM/CV, a NAF/CC, or a Center/CC is authorized a flyover by a
        single aircraft.
        3.6.2.2.4. AFPT jumps in lieu of flyovers are allowed for the personnel authorized
        above.
        3.6.2.2.5. On-base retirement and change of command ceremonies for any other
        military members are not eligible for an Air Force flyover, except when approved
        IAW ETP procedures (paragraph 3.6.2.2.6).
        3.6.2.2.6. Exception-to-policy requests for flyovers supporting retirement and change
        of command ceremonies require HQ USAF/CV approval. HQ USAF/CV approval is
        required for a flyover if the participating aircraft is (are) fr om another service, nation,
        or civilian or ganization.
        3.6.2.2.7. MAJCOMs may authorize aviation support, with thei r respective aircraft,
        in the form of static displays for on-base retirement or change of command
        ceremonies (as designated in MAJCOM supplement to this instruction).
 34                      AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012


       3.6.2.3. Funeral or Memorial Flyovers. Funeral and memorial services for members
       who meet the governing criteria are eligible for Air Force flyovers. Funeral and memorial
       service flyover requests will be initiated by the servicing base Mortuary Of ficer or Air
       Force Mortuary Affairs and staffed through MAJCOMs (M ortuary Affairs and
       Operations directorates) to HQ USAF/ A3OO. Funeral flyover request pr ocedures can be
       found in AFI 34-242. A funeral or memorial flyover is to be flown as part of a training
       sortie, not as a stand-alone mission.
NOTE: The servicing base Mortuary Affairs or Air Force Mortuary Affairs is the single point of
contact for the next of kin.
          3.6.2.3.1. Eligibility. The following list outlines those eligible for an Air Force
          funeral/memorial flyover:
              3.6.2.3.1.1. Active duty or currently serving Air Reserve Component (ARC)
              rated officers (pilots, navigators, air battle managers, observers, and flight
              surgeons) and Career Enlisted Aviators (1AXXX enlisted crewmembers, i.e.
              flight engineers, loadmasters, boom operators, etc.). This category includes those
              taking courses of instruction leading to an aeronautical rating. Treat ARC
              members the same as active duty (eligible when death occurs whether on or off
              duty). This includes ARC members not on unit training assembly (UTA) or
              military orders.
              3.6.2.3.1.2. Active duty or currently serving ARC non-rated officers, non-Career
              Enlisted Aviators, and Operations Support Fl yers (as defined in AFI 1 1-402,
              Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, i.e. nurses,
              medical technicians, intelligence specialists, etc.) but only when death occurs in
              the line of duty w hile performing aviation duties.
              3.6.2.3.1.3. Dignitaries of the Armed Forces and federal government. HQ
              USAF/A3O has the authority to designate Dignitaries of the Armed Forces;
              requests with full justification must be made through the MAJCOM staff to HQ
              AF/A3OO.
              3.6.2.3.1.4. Active duty or retired USAF 3-star and 4-star general officers,
              regardless of aeronautical rating.
              3.6.2.3.1.5. Active Duty or retired Chief Master Sergeants of the Air Force
              (CMSAF).
              3.6.2.3.1.6. USAF members (active duty, retired or honorably separated) who
              have been awarded the Medal of Honor , Air Force Cros s, Army Distinguished
              Service Cross, or Navy Cross.
              3.6.2.3.1.7. USAF aviators (active duty, retired or honorably separated) who have
              achieved at least one or more officially recognized aerial victories. The Air Force
              Historical Research Agency is the official source for aerial victories.
              3.6.2.3.1.8. USAF members (active duty, retired or honorably separated) who
              were Prisoners of War.
NOTE: Repatriated remains of individuals meeting the requirements of paragraph 3.6.2.3.1.1. or
3.6.2.3.1.2. are entitled to flyover honors.
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                           35


       3.6.2.3.2. Although a funeral/memorial flyover may be authorized by meeting the
       above criteria, it may not always be appropriate. A fune ral or memorial flyover is
       part of the honors bestowed on the deceased. If the lifestyle of an individual during or
       following his or her military service is not within the standards normally expected of
       a military professional or if the circumstances surrounding the death reflect
       negatively on the Air Force, a funeral flyover may not be approved in all cases. HQ
       USAF/A3O will make the determination in these cases.
       3.6.2.3.3. If a deceased member is eligible, no further HQ USAF approval is
       required. MAJ-COMs grant participation approval for funeral/memorial flyovers
       (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
       3.6.2.3.4. Memorial Flyovers. Procedures and approval levels for memorial fl yovers
       are the same as for funeral flyovers. Memorial flyove rs commemorate or re cognize
       an individual, group, or historically significant event. MAJCOMs may approve on-
       base flyovers in this category (may be delegated to Wing/CC). For deceased members
       au thorized a flyover per paragraph 3.6.2.3.1, and when the funeral service is held off-
       base, MAJCOM may authorize an additional memorial flyover at the base to which
       the individual was assigned (inform HQ USAF/A3OO). An off-base memorial
       flyover on other than the five patriotic holidays requires an ETP approved by HQ
       USAF/A3O and SAF/PAN.
       3.6.2.3.5. Exceptions-to-Policy. Servicing base Mortuary Affairs initiates requests
       for exceptions to funeral and memorial service policy and staffs the request through
       MAJCOMs to HQ USAF/A3OO. Requests that are handled directly by Air Force
       Mortuary Affairs are staffed to HQ USAF/A3OO. Exceptions-to-policy are based on
       appropriate use of limited resources, and are typically considered only for service
       marked by valor or heroism, or has significantly impacted the aviation community or
       aviation history. ETP requests must reach HQ USAF AF/ A3OO at least 5 working
       days prior to the event. HQ USAF/A3OO will coordinate a package for HQ
       USAF/CVA decision. Include the following in the request:
          3.6.2.3.5.1. DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active
          Duty, or similar discharge documentation recording the individual’s honorable
          discharge, rank, and decorations.
          3.6.2.3.5.2. A letter from the next of kin or the person acting on their behalf
          requesting the flyover.
          3.6.2.3.5.3. A biography of the individual’s service. Include commands and
          significant acts or service to the Air Force and the country.
          3.6.2.3.5.4. Any other information about the individual’s military service that is
          notable.
       3.6.2.3.6. If an exception is approved, HQ USAF/A3 OO will inform MAJCOMs to
       solicit a volunteer unit to perform the flyover . Due to th e short-notice nature of
       many funerals, MAJ-COMs may be asked to solicit volunteers while the approval
       package is being processed.

     3.6.2.4. Missing Man Formation. The missing man formation is a flyover reserved for
     appropriate occasions and is employed only on those occasions when th e theme is
     solemn and commemorative. This formation may be flown for any funeral or memorial
     approved IAW this AFI or to support commemorative events on the followi ng Patriotic
     Holidays: 1) Memorial Day , 2) National POW/MIA Day, and 3) Veterans Day. When
     the missing man formation is flown on a Patriotic Holiday, the commemorative event, wh
     ich the formation supports, may not be held in conjunction with another event such as an
     airshow or sporting event. All other uses of the missing man formation require the
     approval of MAJCOM/A3 (cannot be delegated).
        3.6.2.4.1. (Added-AETC) Do not fly MMF at any time without proper HHQ
        approval.
        3.6.2.4.2. (Added-AETC) The NAF/CC’s approval is required for multiple passes
        at any aerial event. EXCEPTIONS: AETC/CC’s approval is required for multiple
        passes at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). Multiple passes are not
        authorized for patriotic holiday flyovers.
            3.6.2.4.2.1. (Added-AETC) Profile 1 is a single high-speed pass (not to exceed
            FAA airspeed limits) at approved altitudes.
            3.6.2.4.2.2. (Added-AETC) Profile 2 is a traffic pattern speed with gear either
            up or down at approved altitudes.
            3.6.2.4.2.3. (Added-AETC) Repositioning maneuvers between passes will be
            normal traffic pattern procedures, not to include closed-pattern maneuvers.
            3.6.2.4.2.4. (Added-AETC) The MC or PIC will decide the appropriate profile
            to fly and brief accordingly.
            3.6.2.4.2.5. (Added-AETC) AETC aircraft will            not   perform     aerobatic
            maneuvers or aerial demonstrations during a flyover.
     3.6.2.5. For additional information, see paragraph 3.2 and 3.3, and Chapter 5.
  3.6.3. Aerial Review. OASD/PA approval is required for all CONUS public event aerial
  reviews and overseas public event aerial reviews involving CONUS based aircraft. This
  approval is not required at airshows, open houses or international trade shows.
     3.6.3.1. Submit aerial review requests through the MAJCOM to SAF/PAN (inform HQ
     USAF/ A3OO) 45 calendar days before the event date. The request should include the
     date, location, type of event (dedication ceremony, retirement, etc.), and number/type of
     aircraft. SAF/PA will coordinate OASD/PA approval NLT 30 calendar days before the
     event to allow time for MAJCOM/A3 or higher participation approval. For the approval
     of an event for which an aerial review is requested, and which is hosted at a venue
     outside the United States, Canada or Mexico, see paragraph 5.9 and Attachment 2.
     3.6.3.2. The performance of multiple aerial events for a single public event constitutes a
     significant level of Air Force support and communicates to the general public, and event
     or ganizer, a ―public affairs‖ endorsement for the event that is as significant as the
     endorsement that an aerial review would render. To ensure the proper levels of scrutiny a
     nd control, proposals for aviation support involving the performance of multiple aerial
     events for a single public event will be subject to the same approval proce ss that a
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                              37


       proposal for an aerial review would receive for the same public event. To this end,
       SAF/PAN and AF/A3O will approve aviation support proposals for single public events
       that combine an AFPT and flyover, or a flyover and aircraft demonstration (the total
       number of combined individual elements may not exceed four). An example of such a
       combination of aerial ev ents is a 3-ship of F-16s and an AF PT demonstration. Aviation
       support proposals for single public events that combined multiple aerial events will be
       reviewed on a case-by-case basis. When determining the number of elements, the jump
       platform aircraft does not count unless it is performing in some other function in addition
       to being the jump platform.
NOTE: The guidance in this paragraph does not apply to aviation support proposals involving
multiple, combined aerial events planned for open house events, public airshows, and
international trade shows.
   3.6.4. Aerial Demonstration.
       3.6.4.1. Although considered an aerial demonstration, AFPT performances have different
       approval procedures. See paragraph 5.4. AFPT demonstrations can be performed in lieu
       of fly-overs for Patriotic Holidays (paragraph 3.6.2.1).
       3.6.4.2. Flying operations ostensibly conducted for training but which are actually
       intended to be viewed by non-military audiences are in fact aer ial demonstrations and the
       events supported in this manner are public events falling under paragraphs 1.2 and 3.2.
       An example would be the use of Joint Airborne/Air T ransportability Training (JA/ATT)
       missions to airdrop personnel and/or equipment for training while inviting a non-military
       audience to view the airdrop through a public advertising campaign (TV/radio
       announcements, newspa per ads, etc.). In this example, clearly the use of advertising to
       encourage the presence of non-military spectators establishes the activity as an aerial
       demonstration for a public event.
       3.6.4.3. Flying operations conducted for training purposes (whether using training or
       O&M funding) on a facility owned, leased or operated by the DoD, and intended for
       viewing by an audience limited to military personne l, civil service perso nnel,
       dependents and l imited number of invited guests, constitute aerial demonstrations in
       support of military events, and paragraphs 1.3 and 3.3 apply.

                         PARTICIPATION APPROVAL PROCESS

4.1. Static Displays. Participation approval for static displays is delegated to MAJCOM.
MAJCOM can delegate participation approval authority to a lower level. Before approving static
display, the decision process will include force protection concerns. Consider the safety
standards in Attachment 3, along with those in T.O. 00-80G, Make Safe Procedures for Public
Static Display series publications, in planning and staging each static display. Aircraft specific
guidance in a T.O. will supercede the general guidance in this AFI. The following guidelines
apply to all aircraft on static display:
4.1. (AETC) Static Displays. See Attachment 1 of the basic publication, fo r the definition of
a static display. Students in undergraduate or graduate training will not be posted on any static
display aircraft.
   4.1.1. Aircraft on static display must be made safe according to Attachment 3 and
   applicable technical orders (TO).
   4.1.2. A minimum of one qualified aircrew member must be present to answer spectator
   questions and to ensure security at all times the static display is open to the public.
   4.1.3. Ordnance and Munitions. If an event does not involve the expenditure or display of
   munitions, download the aircraft of all expendable ordnance prior to deploying to the event
   site. ―Make safe‖ permanently mounted internal weapons according to applicable TO
   procedures. Place on public display only inert munitions, making them safe according to
   applicable TOs.
4.2. Flyover
   4.2.1. Patriotic Holiday. Participation approval is at the MAJCOM level and is limited to a
   single pass flyover by a single aircraft or by a formation of not more than four aircraft of the
   same type. The commemorative event for which the flyover is performed must occur within
   seven days of the national day of observance of the holiday and must be in direct support of
   the holiday.
   4.2.2. Retirement/Change of Command Ceremony. Participation approval is at the
   MAJCOM level. AF/CV approval may be required for exceptions-to-policy (see paragraph
   3.6.2.2.6).
   4.2.3. Funeral or Memorial Flyovers. It is the responsibility of the MAJCOM to locate
   and identify volunteer flying units. MAJCOM can delegate particip ation approval authority
   to a lower level. Air Force participation in a f uneral or memorial service is limited to a
   single fl yover. It may be flown at the funeral (internment) service or at the memorial service,
   but not at both events (except as approved under paragraph 3.6.2.3.4, where the MAJCOM
   can approve an additional memorial flyover for eligible members at the base to which the
   individual was assigned). Funeral flyovers can be a single ship or a single formation with a
   maximum of four aircraft. A formation flyover may be flown as a missing man formation
   (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                           39


      4.2.3.1. (Added-AETC) Funeral or memorial events are pe rformed to honor fallen
      members of the US Armed Forces and US government of ficials. NAF/A3 may task
      AETC units to perform funeral or memorial event flyovers. See Table A2.1 (Added) and
      Table A4.1 (Added) for further guidance. Funeral and memorial service flyovers must be
      authorized and coordinated according to guidance in AFI 34-242. The Directorate of
      Services (HQ AETC/SV) must verify the member’s eligibility. Funeral flyovers are only
      performed at the time of interment. ( Note: National military cemeteries ar e considered
      off-base facilities.) See Table A2.1 (Added) and Table A4.1 (Added) for guidance on
      memorial flyovers for other than a specific individual, such as prisoners of war (POW)
      and missing in action (MIA) recognition.
      4.2.3.2. (Added-AETC) AETC units may perform a UHMS fl yover in memory of a
      deceased unit member if t he member is eligible accord ing to AFI 34-242. The following
      information applies:
         4.2.3.2.1. (Added-AETC) HQ AETC/SV must verify the member’s eligibility.
         4.2.3.2.2. (Added-AETC) The member must have been assigned to the unit
         performing the flyover at the time of death.
         4.2.3.2.3. (Added-AETC) The flyover must take place over home station within 10
         days of death.
         4.2.3.2.4. (Added-AETC) NAF/A3O will notify HQ AETC/A3FV of the flyover
         specifics.
         4.2.3.2.5. (Added-AETC) NAF/CC is the approval authority for UHMS flyovers.
         4.2.3.2.6. (Added-AETC) DELETED
      4.2.3.3. (Added-AETC) Funeral and or memorial service flyovers for personnel not
      eligible for a memorial service or funeral flyover require an ETP according to AFI 34-
      242. After HHQ grants the ETP, NAF/A3O solicits volunteers from AETC units.
      NAF/A3 may task units to perform these flyovers. Note: See Table A2.1 (Added) and
      Table A4.1 (Added) for further guidance.
   4.2.4. Missing Man Formation. Participation approval for on-base and off-base Patriotic
   Holidays (IAW paragraph 3.6.2.4) is at the MAJCOM level. All other off-base uses of the
   missing man formation require the approval of MAJCOM/A3 (cannot be delegated).

      4.2.4.1. (Added-AETC) See Table A4.1 (Added) for MMF approval levels. Use the
      MMF only at befitting ceremonies, such as a patriotic holiday, Veterans’ monument
      dedication, or POW/MIA remembrance. According to DoDD 5410.18, Public Affairs
      Community Relations Policy, do not fly MMF for opening or closing ceremonies for any
      event, retirement, change of command, sporting game, and airshow.
      4.2.4.2. (Added-AETC) The MMF may be performed as a four-ship with a one-ship
      pullup (Figure 1.1 (Added)) (afterburner use is only authorized for the pullup ai rcraft)
      or as a three-ship phantom formation (Figure 1.2 (Added)).

      4.2.4.3. (Added-AETC) MMFs in a four -ship pullup formation ( Figure 4.1 (Added))
      or a three-ship phantom formation ( Figure 4.2 (Added)) are considered congested area
      flyovers and restricted to minimum altitudes listed in paragraph 1.6.3, as supplemented.
      4.2.4.4. (Added-AETC) OG/CC may approve practice MMF sorties over home station.
      Do not practice MMF sorties off home station or offbase.
   4.2.5. (Added-AETC) FAA flyover waivers require the event POC to submit FAA Form
   7711-2, Certificate of Waiver or Authorization Application, for approval. Waiver approval
   will then be provided on FAA Form 7711-1. Flyovers performed at airshows will follow
   FAA-applied restrictions for the event as indicated on FAA Form 7711-1. Flyovers using
   AETC aircraft will not be flown between the official hours of sunse t to sunrise. See
   paragraph 1.12 (Added) for dissimilar formation procedures. Use the following guidance for
   flyover participation:
      4.2.5.1. (Added-AETC) Immediately after receiving NAF/A3O event slot confirmation,
      the MC or PIC will coordinate flyover specifics with the event POC.
      4.2.5.2. (Added-AETC) Wing commanders will institute procedures to ensure all f
      lyovers are adequately planned and briefed.
      4.2.5.3. (Added-AETC) Only formation current and qualified pilots will fly in
      formations. Note: If applicable, submit waiver or ETP with proper justification and an
      AETC Form 63 through NAF/ A3O to HQ AETC/A3 at least 21 days prior to the event.

Figure 4.2. (Added-AETC) MMF Phantom Three-Ship Formation.
      4.2.5.4. (Added-AETC) Do not perform any flyover as part of student training missions
      or with students on board. Passengers will not occupy a seat at a set of aircraft controls in
      nonejection-seat aircraft during a flyover. Orientation flight passengers are permitted on
      ejection-seat aircraft during single-ship or two-ship formation flyovers in accordance
      with AFI 11-2 MDS-specific instructions and AFI 1 1-401. During the orientation flight
      approval process, wing commanders will ensure appropriate operational risk management
      is applied to reduce any risks involved. In accordance with AFI 11-401, Table 1.1, point-
      to-point orientation flights are not authorized. Travel on aircraft not capable of carrying
      passengers is prohibited in accordance with DoD 4515.13-R. Fly-overs with orientation
      flight passengers on board will be flown at a minimum altitude of 1,000 feet AGL.
      NOTE: A 500-foot AGL waiver will not be granted in accordance with paragraph
      1.6.3.1.1 of this supplement.
      4.2.5.5. (Added-AETC) Flyovers at any patrioti c holiday, sporting event, funeral, or m
      emorial will be limited to one unit, consisting of one to four aircraft, making a single
      pass.
      4.2.5.6. (Added-AETC) DELETED
      4.2.5.7. (Added-AETC) Multiple passes require HHQ approval and are limited to two
      passes of either Profile 1 or 2 (paragraphs 3.6.2.4.2 (Added) through 3.6.2.4.2.5
      (Added)) or a combination thereof during airshows and open house events.
4.3. Aerial Review. After OASD/PA event approval (if required), the level of participation
approval is as follows:
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                                 41


   4.3.1. Assets from Single MAJCOM. Aerial reviews involving assets from a single
   MAJCOM require MAJCOM approval. MAJCOMs will inform HQ USAF/A3OO of aerial
   review approvals and assets involved (other than airshows, Open Houses and trade shows).
   4.3.2. Assets from Multiple MAJCOMs. Multi-MAJCOM aerial reviews require the
   approval of each command providing aircraft for the aerial review (inform HQ
   USAF/A3OO).
   4.3.3. Assets from Multiple Services/Nations, or Involve Civilian Aircraft. HQ USAF/
   A3/5 approval is required for all aerial reviews that combine USAF aircraft with aircraft from
   other services or nations or with civilian aircra ft. Participation approval in OCO NUS aerial
   reviews rests with the COCOM (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
4.4. Aerial Demonstration. Aerial demonstrations are governed by the AFI 11-246 series of
instructions and require the participation approval of the owning MAJCOM.
   4.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs need not publish in their assigne d volume the profiles that are
   uniquely tailored for a specific military or civilian event and which are planned fo r use on a
   one-time basis. Although the lead MAJCOM is released from the re quirement to incorporate
   these uniquely tailored profiles in the command volume, the MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent)
   having jurisdiction over the participating aircrew and aircraft must approve every uniquely
   tailored profile prior to its execution. If the uniquely tailored profile is planned to be used on
   a continuing basis, then the MAJCOM must submit the profile to the lead MAJCOM for
   possible inclusion in AFI 11-246 series.
   4.4.2. MAJCOMs may publish profiles in the M AJCOM supplement to this instruction for
   flight operations or procedures falling outside the purview of the applicable AFI 11-246
   series.
   4.4.3. Aerial demonstration profiles, for any aircraft that is not covered under the AFI 11-
   246 series, must be approved by the MAJCOM/C C owning the aircraft. This will not be
   delegated. MAJCOM approved profiles can consist of multiple passes.
   4.4.4. AFPT demonstrations can be performed for commemorative events supporting
   Patriotic holidays instead of flyovers—participation approval is at the MAJCOM.
   4.4.5. AFPT demonstrations supporting retirement/change of command ceremonies in lieu of
   authorized flyovers are allowed—participation approval is at the MAJCOM.
4.5. (Added-AETC) Participation Approval. Units must submit an email request to
NAF/A3O to participate in most aerial events. (See Table A2.1 (Added) and Table A4.1
(Added) for further guidance.) NAF/A3O will return a slot confirmation to the unit. The event
POC has final authority on which unit and aircraft will support their respective events. Units will
not use the SAF/PAC Web site links to sign up for an aerial event until NAF/A3O has sent the
slot confirmation.
4.6. (Added-AETC) Canceling Support for Events:
   4.6.1. (Added-AETC) Units must ensure every effort is made to support scheduled events
   in which there is a commitment. If canceling support 20 days prior to an event, NAF/A3 must
   approve the cancellation.
42                      AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012


  4.6.2. (Added-AETC) If support for an event mu st be cancelled within th e 20-day period,
  the unit must send an email to NAF/A3O explaining the reason for cancellation along with
  the concurrence of the OG/CC. Reasons for cancellation must be compel ling. Reasons such
  as loss of volunteer pilot, inconvenience, ahead of flying hour program, or behind on PFT
  will not be approved.
4.7. (Added-AETC) Medical and Search and Rescue (SAR) Training Static and
Demonstrations:
  4.7.1. (Added-AETC) AETC SAR units and units with pa ssenger-carrying aircraft may
  perform medical and SAR static an d demonstrations at events for training civili an and
  military medical and SAR personnel (including Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD
  state and federal government medical and SAR teams). These events are closed to the general
  public (nonairshows). For SAR demonstrations at all other aerial events refer to paragraph
  1.4.4, the applicable Table A2.1 (Added) and Table A4.1 (Added) for approval authority.
  AETC units will notify NAF/A3O at least 14 days prior to the event using AETC Form 8.
  4.7.2. (Added-AETC) SAR units may perform hoist/stokes de monstrations. SAR units and
  passenger carrying aircraft units may provide static aircraft for loading and unloading patient
  training/demonstrations.
  4.7.3. (Added-AETC) Civilian, DoD, and non-AETC military SAR team members may be
  flown in MEGP status on AETC aircraft during actual SAR missions. The aircraft used must
  be passenger-carrying capable. Civilian, DoD, and non-AETC military SAR members will
  not take part in demonstrations; for example, riding in a stokes litter or flying as pa ssengers
  unless auth orized under DoD 4515-13R or AFI 11-401.
  4.7.4. (Added-AETC) OG/CC may approve practice sorties over home station. Practice
  sorties flown at off-home station require NAF/CC approval.
  4.7.5. (Added-AETC) The MC or PIC forwards predeployment briefing slides according to
  AETCI 11-207, Participation in Exercises, Deployments, and Competitions, at least 10 days
  prior to the event. Send an after-action report according to procedures and guidance in
  AECTI 11-207.
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                              43


                                           Chapter 5

                                 ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE

5.1. USAF Academy (USAFA) On-Base Events. All definitions and policy regarding flyovers
and aerial reviews apply to the USAFA. Examples of approved on-base academy events are
graduation ceremonies, football games, parades, ceremonies with a patriotic/military theme, etc.
The commandant requests appropriate Air Force partic ipation, which is limited to flyove rs,
parachute demonstrations and glider demonstrations.
   5.1.1. Academy officials will notify participating MAJCOMs when flyovers are scheduled
   by more than one MAJCOM on the same day. Participation must be approved by the owning
   MAJCOM. When more than one flyover is scheduled within any three hour period, this
   notification will include as a minimum: flyover timing, number of aircraft in each flight,
   direction of flight, altitude, USAFA point of contact, and other information deemed
   necessary for safety of flight.
   5.1.2. For each event, the flyover will consist of not more than four aircraft of the same type
   making one pass.
   5.1.3. USAFA officials will notify HQ USAF/A3 OO, SAF/PAN and SAF/PAM 10 days
   before the event date of any flyover that may have national media coverage (i.e., coverage of
   a football game or graduation).
   5.1.4. (Added-AETC) Additional aircraft of the same MDS from different units must be
   specifically requested by the USAFA POC and require aerial review submittal to NAF/A3O.
   5.1.5. (Added-AETC) DELETED
   5.1.6. (Added-AETC) The 306 FTG is the point of contact for USAFA aerial event issues.
5.2. MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM Flyover Requests. Requests from one MAJCOM to another for
sin-gle-ship or formation flyo vers in support of military events are approved by the MAJCOM
owning the requested assets.
   5.2.1. Within the USAF, requests for Air Force particip ation in a military event must be sent
   from requesting unit (base) to its pa rent MAJCOM and, if approved, from the parent
   MAJCOM to the MAJCOM owning the requested aircraft, except fo r requests supporting an
   open house. For an open house, the requesting unit may send a request for participation
   directly to the unit owning the desired aircraft or equipment; the owning unit will ensure all
   coordination/approval requirements imposed by the owning MAJCOM are satisfied before
   committing support.
   5.2.2. Air Force units are to follow MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM procedures when requesting
   aircraft from the US Army, Navy, or Marine Corps. For MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM requests,
   include HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN as information addressees whenever the approval
   level involves any of the following: HQ USAF/CV, HQ USAF/CVA, HQ USAF/A3/5, HQ
   USAF/A3O, SAF/AQ or OASD/PA.
5.3. Dissimilar Formation Formations of four or fewer aircraft of multiple MDS and the same
type are approved by MAJCOM/A3. Formations of four or fewer aircraft comprised of Air Force
aircraft with aircraft from other services or nations, or with civilian aircraft that do not meet
 44                       AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012


aerial review criteria (i.e., airshows, open houses or international trade shows) require
MAJCOM/CC approval (inform HQ USAF/ A3OO for HQ USAF/CC and A3/5 vi sibility). It is
incumbent upon MAJCOMs to provide operational oversight when approving mixed MDS
formations of the same type. ACC Supplement 1 to AFI 11-246, Volume 1 covers ACC Heritage
Flight formations and AFI 11-246, Volume 2 covers AETC Texan Flight formations.
5.4. Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT). Event and participation approval for an AFP T
demonstration (i.e., by the United States Air Force Academy’s ―Wings of Blue‖) is granted using
the same procedures as a flyover (IAW Chapter 3 and Chapter 4). Air Force aircraft serving as
jump platforms for AFPT demonstrations at public or military ev ents, do not require separate ap
proval. Event approval for the AFPT constitutes approval for the jump platform.
NOTE: If the aircraft serving as the jump platform is separately performing at the event (i.e.
additional flyover or aerial demonstration), then separate approval is required. For aircraft
serving as jump platforms supporting other service parachute team demonstrations , the ―event
approval‖ for the aircraft is in conjunction with the approval for the parachute team (inform
SAF/ PAN and HQ USAF/A3OO). Owning MAJCOM may still require participation approval
for their ―jump platform‖ aircraft.
5.5. Record Flights and Flights of a Spectacular Nature. Flights of this nature require
SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3O approval. See AFI 35-101, Chapter 8 for additional restrictions.
5.6. Test Aircraft. Aerial events of any kind, including static displays, involving aircraft or
equipment undergoing testing in a research and development program require approval from
SAF/PAN, HQ USAF/ A3/5, and SAF/AQ.
5.7. Heritage/Texan Flight Training Programs. The following guidance applies to the ACC
Heritage Flight and AETC Texan Flight Training programs.
   5.7.1. The intent of the annual training program is to prepare Air Force aircrews and vintage
   aircraft pilots to safely fly in formation at public air shows and open house events that benefit
   Air For ce recruiting and community relations programs. Appropriated funds may be
   expended for warbird aviation fuel associated with that training. Because warbird pilots and
   support staff are acting in an official capacity related to DoD activities, use of invitational
   travel orders to pay travel, per diem, lodging and local transportation is also permitted as
   specified in the Joint Travel Regulation, Volume II, Appendix E. MAJCOM approved
   Blanket Purchase Agreements with contractors may be used to c over expenses.
   5.7.2. MAJCOMs will ensure compliance with applicable AFIs including AFI 11-401,
   Aviation Management. Military aircrew members and key military leadership may fly on
   warbird civil aircraft during training sessions. Military media personnel and civilian media
   personnel (as part of an approved media orientation flight IAW AFI 35-101) may fly as
   passengers on those warbirds engaged in observation flights provided the aircraft are not
   engaged in demonstr ation training or formation flights. Training is to take place over
   unpopul ated areas. All warbirds must have liability insurance covering training flights and
   passengers.
   5.7.3. This guidance covers all training conferences and annual preseason flight training
   conducted in accordance with AFI 11-246. Secretary of Defense and CSAF policies
   regarding civilian pilots operating USAF aircraft still apply, unless specifically waived.
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                               45


5.8. Airshows/Open Houses. The term "open house" identifies a traditional activity held on
military installations while the term ―airshow‖ identifies a civilian activity. Open house and
airshow have been used interchangeably in the past, but open house is a more comprehensive
term for the spectrum of events in the Air Force. Airshows and open houses may be supported by
multiple s tatic displays, multiple fly-overs (with multiple passe s) and multiple aerial
demonstrations. AFI 10-1004 (when released) will provide guidance and procedures fo r
planning and conducting Air Fo rce open houses. SAF/PA approves civilian airshows for Air
Force support (event approval IAW paragraph 3.2) and MAJCOMs approve the participation of
their respective aircraft.
5.9. Overseas Public and Military Events. For public events outside the United S tates,
Canada and Mexico, the combatant commanders exercise event and participation approval over
events falling within their respective Areas of Responsibility (AOR) (except as noted below).
The combatant commanders may delegate the responsibility for event and participation approval.
The delegates will notify SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3OO of their delegated authority. See
paragraph 5.10 for event and participation appr oval for international airshow and trade
exhibitions.
   5.9.1. MAJCOMs will inform HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN when CONUS based aircraft
   will participate in overseas events (public or military) at least 30 days prior to the event for
   CSAF visibility. Additionally, inform HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN for any USAF
   aircraft participation in overseas events at non-DoD facilities at least 30 days prior to the
   event for CSAF visibility. If the request from the event is short notice, precluding a 30-day
   notification, inform HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/ PAN immediately. Responsibility for this
   notification is pr imarily with the owning MAJCOM, but notification may come from the
   OCONUS MAJCOM. HQ USAF or OASD/PA approval may be required in some cases
   where CONUS based aircraft participate in overseas events.
       5.9.1.1. (Added-AETC) If the aerial event (airshow , flyover, demonstration, aerial
       review) is outside the continental United States (OCONUS), the MC or PIC participating
       in an aerial event must submit the following information via electronic staff summary
       sheet to NAF/CC:
          5.9.1.1.1. (Added-AETC) DELETED
          5.9.1.1.2. (Added-AETC) All OCONUS approach plates, in cluding emergency
          fields, prior to the event. Units with airfi elds not having compatible radio
          navigational aids are not required, but are highly recommended to send the approach
          plates.
          5.9.1.1.3. (Added-AETC) Documentation on all en route stops, return stops, and
          remain-overnight locations.
          5.9.1.1.4. (Added-AETC) PowerPoint slides for all OCONUS aerial events 10 days
          prior to the event. See AETCI 11-207, for the briefing format. Note: Events in
          Canada do not require slides.
       5.9.1.2. (Added-AETC) Students in undergraduate- or graduate-level flying training
       courses are not allowed on aircraft attending OCONUS events.
 46                       AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012


       5.9.1.3. (Added-AETC) Passengers are allowed on aircraft capable of carrying
       passengers on a space-available status according to DoDD 4500.56; DoD 4515.13-R; and
       AFI 11-2 MDS-specific instructions. EXCEPTION: Passengers are not allowed on
       ejection-seat aircraft.
   5.9.2. Aerial Reviews at overseas events with assets from multiple services or nations, or
   that involve civilian aircraft, will be approved IA W paragraph 4.3 in addition to combatant
   command directives (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
   5.9.3. Notwithstanding the combatant commanders’ participation approval authority over
   aircraft entering their respective AORs, the owning MAJCOMs’ operational control over
   their aircraft is not preempted or diminished.
   5.9.4. Aerial events of any kind involving aircraft or equipment undergoing testing in a
   research and development program require approval from SAF/PAN, HQ USAF/A3, and
   SAF/AQ.
5.10. International Airshows and Trade Exhibitions. This paragraph applies to USAF direct
participation at international ai rshows and trade exhibitions, or ganized primarily for promoting
sales of aerospace and other defense products (I AW DoDD 7230.8). For internation al airshows
and other events that are organized only for the demonstration or display of aircraft and other
defense equipment in support of public affairs activities, see paragraph 5.9.
   5.10.1. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD(P)) has approval authority for DoD
   participation in international airshows and trad e exhibitions, as delega ted by the Secretary
   of Defense. No Air Force organization can participate in an international airshow or trade
   exhibition unless the USD(P) has approved ―direct DoD participation‖ and satisfied the other
   pr ovisions of the law. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), staf f agency for
   USD(P), posts policy, guidelines, and status information on international airshows and trade
   exhibitions on its web site (http://www.dsca.osd.mil).
   5.10.2. Geographic combatant commanders, through their Air Force component
   commanders, and in conjunction with the US Embassy country team, implement USD(P)
   airshow policy and initiate requests for participation.
   5.10.3. The Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force, International Affairs (SAF/IA)
   coordinates Headquarters Air Force actions, to include politico-military analysis, validation
   of requirements IAW USAF Security Cooperation Guidance, identificati on of USAF assets
   requested, and coordination with industry.
   5.10.4. Additionally, HQ USAF/A3OO will submit the lists of re quested USAF assets to the
   MAJ-COMs to determine operational impact and to coordinate participation of assets from
   outside the requesting geographic combatant commander's AOR. During this process, HQ
   USAF/A3O reconciles the asset requests against the MAJCOM's operationa l concerns,
   develops requirement lists (with USAF senior leadership positions), and tasks support as
   required.
   5.10.5. MAJCOMs with units planning to participate in international airshows and trade
   exhibitions must first coordinate with DSCA via SAF/IA. This is normally accomplished
   during periodic teleconferences hosted by DSCA. Planni ng and execution details are de
   veloped by the MAJCOMs during this conference.

term aerial demonstration and the Air Force term aerial demonstration is synonymous with the
DoD term aerial activity.
Aerial Control Team (ACT)—A qualified individual or team of individuals who oversee and
control USAF aerial participation, and aerial participation by other organizations, in selected
public or military events. ACT can be used synonymously with Ground Liaison Officer (GLO)
for the purposes of this instruction.
Aerial Demonstration—Aerial demonstration, a subset of aviation support, includes virtually
every type of aerial participation by fixed-wing or rotary-wi ng aircraft in public or mili tary
events (except aerial review and flyover): aerobatics, assault landing/takeoffs, aircraft weapons
or tactics demonstrations, USAF vintage aircraft programs, single-ship demonstration teams,

degrees below the horizon and begins in the morning when the center of the sun’s disk is 6
degrees below the horizon, as published in the American Air A lmanac, converted to local time.
This is the limit at which twilight illumination is suf ficient, under good weather conditions, for
terr estrial objects to be clearly distinguished, and the ho rizon is clearly defined under good
atmospheric co nditions in the absence of moonlight or other illumination. In the morning before
the beginning of Civil Twilight and in the evening after the end of Civi l Twilight, artificial

similar pr ograms. These events may be on or off-base; CONUS or OCONUS. Public events can
be sponsored by ei ther DoD or non-DoD organizations. Military exercises, movements,
maneuve rs, or operations are not considered to be public events merely on the basis of being
incidentally observed by the general public. Such events can be good community relations and
recruiting opportunities.

trainer (T -1, T-37, T-38, T-6) and rotary wing (UH-1, HH-60, MH-53, CV-22). Aircraft not
listed are considered their own unique type and will comply with multi-type restrictions in this
instructio n (i.e. Aerial Re view or dissimilar formation). It is understood that true aircraft roles
and missions are numerous and it would be difficult to categorize all aircraft. These are general
groupings based on size, mission and/or configuration as viewed by the general public.
Individual missions and series are grouped under the same design for the purpose of this
definition (i.e. EC-130H, and C-130J). It is incumbent upon MAJCOMs to provide operational
oversight when approving mixed MDS formations of the same type.
Unit Change of Aircraft Ceremony—A ceremony that recognizes the conversion of aircraft
type within a unit.
Unit Flag Retirement Ceremony—A ceremony during which an active or air reserve
component unit is deactivated and the unit flag retired.
Unit Training Assembly (UTA)—Unit training periods cons isting of a minimum of 4 hours
each, to include the majority of assigned personnel. Norm ally four UTAs are scheduled on one
weekend each month.
Vintage Aircraft Program—For the purpose of this instruction, the USAF vintage aircraft
programs are the Heritage Flight Program operated by ACC, and the T-6A Texan II Aerial
Demonstration Team operated by AETC.
(AETC) Terms —Photo Shoot—Photo shoot is considered a flight by a military or civilian news
media representative, journalist, or photographer for the sole purpose of taki ng pictures or vi deo
tape onboard the aircraft for military or civilian use. It is different from a non-media
representative who is taking pictures for the sole purpose of private use, and as a by -product of
the flight. Approval authorization is specified in this supplement and in AFI 11-401.

                                                  NOTES:
1. MMFs may be flown as three-ship phantom or four-ship formation. The OG/CC may approve MMF
practice sorties over home station. MMF sorties will not be practiced off home station or offbase.
2. The MC or PIC will coordinate with the local FAA Flight Standards District Office before performing a
flyover.
3. All funeral flyovers are considered offbase and are performed at the time of actual interment. Authorized
members can only have a funeral flyover or a memorial flyover according to AFI 34-242, but not both. This
does not preclude a UHMS flyover.
4. Afterburners use is authorized for pullup or safety once the event is approved for MMF. Other afterburner
use requires NAF/CC approval.
5. Memorial flyovers can be performed onbase or offbase. The flyover can be flown at any location if the
flyover is approved by HHQ and coordinated with the FAA. Authorized members can have either a funeral
flyover or a memorial service flyover according to AFI 34-242, but not both. This does not preclude a
UHMS flyover.
6. The MC or PIC must coordinate with the base commander or the designated representative to coordinate
flyover factors 20 days prior to flight. The MC or PIC will forward the unit or base commander’s flyover
approval and any restrictions to NAF/A3O 14 days prior to the event.
7. The event must be performed at home station within 10 days of the death. HQ AETC/SV must verify the
member is authorized a flyover according to AFI 34-242. This does not preclude a funeral or memorial
service flyover.
8. The event must be a solemn ceremony befitting the performance of the formation and cannot be flown in
conjunction with another event (such as a sports game).

A5.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) Individual Selection and Qualification.
   A5.1.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) For the purposes of Aerial Review authorization and approval,
   the term ―Dissimilar Flyby‖ will refer to the formation of aircraft defined in paragraph
   A5.5.4. Individuals chosen for dissimilar formation duties must be qualified in dissimilar
   formation flying and complete a 47 OG/CC approved dissimilar formation syllabus. This
   syllabus, at a minimum will include a dissimilar flyby with a dissimilar formation certified
   pilot. Dissimilar formation pilots will be certified by the squadron commander and
   documented on the unit Letter of Xs. Additionally, the aircraft commander (AC) in each
   aircraft will be certified in dissimilar formation flying.
   A5.1.2. (LAUGHLINAFB) For dissimilar flyovers, the default lead aircraft be the T-1 then
   T-6. The AC in the lead aircraft is responsible for all aspects of the dissimilar flyover, and
   will be certified as a dissimilar formation pilot. The lead AC is also appointed the Mission
   Commander.
A5.2. (LAUGHLINAFB) Briefing.
   A5.2.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) The Mission Commander will plan, brief, and lead the
   dissimilar formation, or supervise the upgrading dissimilar flyover flight lead. In the event a
   T-1 is not participating, the T-6 AC will brief and lead the formation.
   A5.2.2. (LAUGHLINAFB) The briefing will include lost wingman procedures, NORDO
   procedures, break-out procedures, wake turbulence avoidance, safe minimum airspeeds for
   participating aircraft, split-up procedures that include specific headings and altitudes and
   fallout plans. Additionally, formation briefing items such as operational risk management,
   ground operations, takeoff and departure procedures, rejoin and marshalling plan, run-in and
   flyby procedures and the flight split-up will be briefed.
A5.3. (LAUGHLINAFB) Ground Operations.
   A5.3.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) All participating aircraft will depart from the same airfield.
   A5.3.2. (LAUGHLINAFB) Endurance and maneuvering airspeed of each participating
   aircraft will be considered when determining takeoff times.
   A5.3.3. (LAUGHLINAFB) The lead aircraft will monitor the SOF frequency or a
   prebriefed discrete formation frequency throughout all taxi operations to stay informed of
   aircraft fallout and spares.
A5.4. (LAUGHLINAFB) Departure and Join-up.
   A5.4.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) The lead aircraft will orbit at a prebriefed altitude, normally
   4000-6000’ MSL. The standard join-up location is a holding pattern defined by the DLF
   038/025 fix. Aircraft will
hold northeast of the fix in right-hand turns from 25 to 35 DME.
   A5.4.2. (LAUGHLINAFB) Aircraft will join up in prebriefed order and call all previous
   aircraft in sight. Aircraft will stay a minimum of 500 feet below (and outside of a mile with
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                               71


   flight following) the formation’s altitude until visual with the formation. Upon request,
   RAPCON may provide traffic advisories to assist the join-up. Once the designated flight
   lead has joined the formation, it will squawk for the formation to enhance clearing with
   TCAS.
   A5.4.3. (LAUGHLINAFB) Rejoin airspeed will be a minimum of 30% greater than the
   highest stall speed of all participating aircraft (minimum of 230 Knots for a fully fueled T-
   38). Use caution for wake turbulence in close formation and during the rejoin. If crossing
   the formation’s six o’clock, aircraft should be flown below the formation’s plane of motion
   with sufficient room to avoid any wake turbulence.
A5.5. (LAUGHLINAFB) Flyover Procedures.
   A5.5.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) When dissimilar flyovers are flown locally through VFR
   patterns, the VFR traffic patterns will be sterilized (to include all runways’ VFR traffic
   patterns). A local NOTAM will be published and will provide sterile pattern times and
   requirements.
   A5.5.2. (LAUGHLINAFB) Flyover aircraft will utilize appropriate tower or ATC
   frequency for departure and enroute to the rejoin location. The lead aircraft will brief and
   utilize an appropriate communications plan for the sortie.
   A5.5.3. (LAUGHLINAFB) Weather minimums for local 47 FTW dissimilar flyovers will
   be IAW AFI 11-209 AETCSUP 1 paragraph 1.6.2; however, aircrews for local dissimilar
   flyovers may desire higher ceilings due to marshaling and rejoin plans. The dissimilar
   formation should alter altitudes and marshalling/ingress routings to avoid IMC conditions.
   The flight lead will contact the SOF for field updates if doubt exists concerning required
   weather minimums. Dissimilar formations will not penetrate IMC.
   A5.5.4. (LAUGHLINAFB) Formation numbering: No. 1 - T-1, No. 2 - T-6, No. 3 - T-38.
   Reference Fig. A5.5.
   A5.5.5. (LAUGHLINAFB) Close formation references. (Fig. A5.1, A5.2, A5.3, A5.4)
   A5.5.6. (LAUGHLINAFB) Route formation. Route formation will be flown from two
   ship-widths to 500' spacing for aircraft on the wing and approximately one to two ship-
   lengths spacing aft. For route turns, aircraft will maintain in a "stack level" echelon position
   except for the inside aircraft, who may descend to keep lead and other aircraft in sight.
   Route will be flown to aid clearing when close formation is not necessary. Unless briefed
   otherwise, all rejoins will be to route formation. Lead will direct route or close formation as
   required.
   A5.5.7. (LAUGHLINAFB) Laughlin run-in ground track. Optimum run-in ground track is
   perpendicular to all runways (approximate heading of 219 degrees), slightly left of the base
   flagpole.
   A5.5.8. (LAUGHLINAFB) Laughlin run-in procedures.                 Minimum altitude for the
   dissimilar formation is 1000’ AGL. At or prior to 5 NM, lead will direct the formation to
   reform to close formation (paragraph A5.5.5.) and descend to 1000’ AGL to allow the
   formation to stabilize well prior to the target. After the flyby and when out of visual range
   with spectators, lead will climb to the briefed egress altitude and may direct the formation to
   a route position.

      A5.5.8.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) Some flyovers may require steeper descents and more
      maneuvering due to weather avoidance, ATC altitude restrictions, and timing
      adjustments. The lead aircraft should consider making courtesy ―speed brake/push it up‖
      calls when necessary and avoid steep turns when at low altitude.
A5.6. (LAUGHLINAFB) Formation Split-up.
   A5.6.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) The mission commander will specifically brief the formation
   split up, including headings and altitudes to be accomplished during the procedure. Upon
   completion of the dissimilar flyover, the lead aircraft will direct the split-up. Each aircraft
   will acknowledge being cleared off prior to executing heading or altitude changes that were
   previously briefed. Aircraft departing the formation will continue their flight as briefed and
   follow any airfield quiet procedures if still applicable.
A5.7. (LAUGHLINAFB) Abnormal Procedures.
   A5.7.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) Fall out. Squadrons should have at least one spare available.
   Lead may renumber flight members on the ground, due to fallout.
      A5.7.1.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) Fallout/Phantom wingman procedures. The T-1 is the
      default flight lead and therefore will continue as lead if either the T-6 or T-38 falls out. If
      the T-1 falls out, the T-6 will lead the T-38. If both the T-1 and T-6 fall out, the T-38
      will normally continue as a single-ship flyby.
   A5.7.2. (LAUGHLINAFB) Late to join-up. Join-up to prebriefed position. Ensure
   adequate separation from all aircraft in the dissimilar formation until visual can be
   maintained.
   A5.7.3. (LAUGHLINAFB) Overshoots. Call overshoots and maintain safe separation from
   all formation members. Complete the rejoin when closure is under control and all flight
   members in are sight.
   A5.7.4. (LAUGHLINAFB) Break-out procedures. If unable to maintain safe formation
   position, maneuver away from the formation, obtain separation and keep the formation in
   sight. Use caution when breaking-out with other aircraft flying in close/route formation.
   A5.7.5. (LAUGHLINAFB) Knock-it-Off. Any flight member can call ―Knock-it-off‖
   (KIO) in case of an emergency, dangerous situation developing, or any circumstance that
   may affect safety of flight. Flight members will acknowledge the KIO in order and clear
   their flight paths. The flight lead will remain predictable and direct a rejoin if necessary. If
   low altitude, initiate a climb and in all cases, all flight members will deconflict from each
   other and maintain visual.
   A5.7.6. (LAUGHLINAFB) Lost Wingman. Dissimilar formations will be flown in VMC.
   However, formation members should always be prepared for a lost wingman situation. In all
   lost wingman situations, simultaneously transition to instruments, execute the procedures
   below and coordinate for rejoin (if appropriate) upon regaining visual.
      A5.7.6.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) Wings level flight:
          A5.7.6.1.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) If No. 2 or 3 go lost wingman, simultaneously
          transition to instruments, turn away 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds while
          informing lead, then resume original heading.
AFI11-209_AETCSUP_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2012                                            73


       A5.7.6.2. (LAUGHLINAFB) Inside the turn:
           A5.7.6.2.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) If No. 2 or 3 is lost wingman, momentarily reduce
           power to ensure nose/tail separation and inform lead to roll out. Maintain angle of
           bank to ensure lateral deconfliction.
       A5.7.6.3. (LAUGHLINAFB) Outside the turn:
           A5.7.6.3.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) If No. 2 or 3 is lost wingman on the outside of the
           turn, simultaneously transition to instruments, reverse turn using 15 degrees of bank
           for 15 seconds, then resume the turn after ensuring separation.
A5.8. (LAUGHLINAFB) NORDO and Chase procedures.
   A5.8.1. (LAUGHLINAFB) Any aircraft in the dissimilar formation may provide
   chase/NORDO assistance as required.
