                                           Chapter 1

                           PLANNING AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Mission. The primary mission of all Air Force unit historians is the production of periodic
histories. In the context of this Air Force Instruction (AFI), these histories cover “contingency”
activity and form the foundation of all subsequent efforts to document the Air Force’s mission
accomplishments. The primary mission of CMAJCOM/ C-NAF History Office(s), and their
subordinate organizations, involved in operations covered by this AFI is to prepare periodic
history reports documenting the operational activities of deployed personnel and organizations.
1.2. Scope and References. Personnel in the Air Force History and Museums Program
(AFHMP) participate in support of all types of Air Force operations across the full spectrum of
conflict, including conventional campaigns, contingencies, humanitarian assistance/disaster
recovery, and steady-state deployments. Many United States Air Force (USAF) organizations
cooperate with history offices to develop plans for this AFHMP participation. These plans
implement the policies and directives of the Department of Defense (DoD), Joint Chiefs of Staff
(JCS), Headquarters USAF (HAF), and the unified commands. Five key references for the war
planning process include:
     1.1.1. USAF War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 1 (WMP-1), Annex M.
     1.1.2. AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.
     1.1.3. AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution.
     1.1.4. DoD 5200.01-M, Information Security Program.
     1.1.5. AFI 84-101, Historical Products, Services, and Requirements.
1.3. History and Museums Policies and Programs (AF/HO) develops and implements
contingency and war-planning policy for all Air Force History Offices, including those
functioning in a component role under a unified combatant command.
     1.2.1. AF/HO manages Unit Type Code (UTC) RFGAE. This is a single-person UTC that
     covers all Air Force Historians, civilian, officer and enlisted.
     1.2.2. The AF/HO Deputy for Field History Programs serves as the Career Field Manager
     (CFM) for all civilian historians as identified in AFI 10-401. Coordinates contingency
     historical tasks with DoD, JCS, unified combatant commands, Chief of Staff of the United
     States Air Force (CSAF)-directed analysis teams, and USAF staff agencies. Ensures force
     modules include historians when appropriate.
     1.2.3. Provides policy and guidance for implementing the USAF WMP-1, base support, and
     related planning.
     1.2.4. Coordinates with the JCS Director of Joint History to avoid duplication of effort and
     to promote the efficient collection and preservation of information relating to combat and
     contingency operations. The Joint History Program focuses on the planning and decisions of
     unified combatant commanders, while the Air Force History Program focuses on unit
     personnel working to accomplish the unit’s mission. AF/HO informs the JCS History Office
     about USAF requirements and plans.
AFI 84-102 24 JULY 2013                                                                         5


   1.2.5. In coordination with the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC), Directorate of Air and
   Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) and Personnel Operations, implements AFHMP
   participation in AEF deployments.
   1.2.6. As soon as possible after the start of contingency operations, AF/HO coordinates with
   the affected C-MAJCOMs, Supporting/Force Supplier MAJCOMs, C-NAFs, and the
   AFHMP AEF Scheduler to determine History command and control policies and procedures
   for the operation(s). Decisions made by the group will be reviewed periodically during the
   course of contingency operations to ensure compliance with Air Force command and control
   structures and procedures.
   1.2.7. AF/HO coordinates with affected organizations to review deployment policies and
   procedures. This Deployment Review Panel (DRP) includes representatives from AF/HO, the
   Air Force Historical Studies Office (AF/HOH), Air Force Historical Research Agency
   (AFHRA), C-MAJCOMs/C-NAFs, AFRC, AFHMP AEF Scheduler, personnel with recent
   deployment experience, and other members as determined by AF/HO.
       1.2.7.1. AF/HO develops agenda items for DRP meetings based in part upon historian
       after-action reports (AARs) and input from members of the AFHMP.
       1.2.7.2. The DRP addresses agenda items and evaluates historian deployment
       requirements, procedures, and the substance and utility of historical contingency reports.
       1.2.7.3. The Director of the AFHMP will formulate or revise AFHMP contingency
       deployment and reporting guidance based upon this process.
1.4. Air Force Historical Studies Office produces books, monographs, and studies detailing
Air Force activities and operations documented by historians operating under this
AFI. AF/HOH will develop a publication plan in consultation with the director of the AFHMP,
AFHRA, the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF Historians, and the Supporting/Force Providing MAJCOMs,
and other affected organizations. AF/HOH will review and update the plan as needed during the
course of the contingency and provide status updates to the Director of the AFHMP concerning
products in progress. AF/HOH provides input to initial and subsequent DRPs regarding special
areas of research by deployed historians required to support the writing of publications contained
in the contingency publication plan, annual publication plan, and other publications as assigned.
1.5. Air Force Historical Research Agency collects, indexes, and preserves contingency
historical reports and other operational records. AFHRA:
   1.4.1. Makes historical contingency reports available through the Inferential Retrieval and
   Indexing System (IRIS) within 30 days of receipt.
   1.4.2. Produces and maintains lineage and honors histories of all units participating in
   contingency operations.
   1.4.3. Conducts periodic Historian Training Courses as required to ensure Air Force
   Historians are trained to produce contingency and wartime historical reports as outlined in
   this instruction.
1.6. Supported Component Major Command/Component Numbered Air Force History
Offices will be the Supported Command History Office in cases where the Commander, Air
Force Forces (COMAFFOR) role is assigned to a component Numbered Air
Force. Supported C-MAJCOM/C-NAF History Office(s):
 6                                                                    AFI 84-102 24 JULY 2013


     1.5.1. Prepare periodic histories of their organization in accordance with the guidelines
     established in AFI 84-101 (See Attachment 5, C-MAJCOM/C-NAF History Annex).
     1.5.2. Provide material support to deployed historians.
     1.5.3. In coordination with AF/HO, and the intermediate MAJCOM when applicable (i.e.,
     Twelfth Air Force and Air Combat Command, Fifth Air Force and Pacific Air Forces, etc.),
     provide guidance to deployed historians from their arrival in theater until their departure.
     1.5.4. Provide deployed historians with security and content feedback as soon as possible
     after the receipt of each contingency historical report. Evaluations of contingency historical
     reports are less formal than those prepared for annual periodic historical reports compiled
     under AFI 84-101. In general, follow guidance in AFI 84-101, Attachment 21, for security
     and content evaluations. Emphasizing content and security in all feedback ensures products
     of long-term utility. Format, organization and style are less important and only merit
     feedback to the deployed historian for substandard submissions. Send a copy of each
     assessment to AF/HO, the deployed historian’s parent MAJCOM/HO, and the C-
     MAJCOM/HO.
     1.5.5. Respond to requests for historical information that are beyond the capability of
     deployed historians.
     1.5.6. Through AF/HO, advise joint (unified command) headquarters on guidance provided
     to deployed Air Force historians.
     1.5.7. Maintain a complete listing of deployed historians and their contact information to
     include e-mail address, mailing address, and DSN telephone number. Forward this list to
     AF/HO at the beginning of each rotation.
     1.5.8. Coordinate with deployed historians and their replacements as early as possible in the
     current rotation. This affords effective transitions between historians. Provide deployed
     historians with their replacement’s contact information. Deployed historians are in the best
     position to answer questions regarding local policies, conditions, and points of contact
     (POCs) for issues related to local administrative processes.
     1.5.9. Provide theater-specific training as appropriate.
     1.5.10. Provide a copy of every contingency historical report to AFHRA. If possible, retain a
     copy of each report. Distribute additional copies as required.
     1.5.11. In consultation with AF/HO, can revise the monthly reporting requirement as
     circumstances warrant. However, such changes must align with the length of the AEF
     rotation. For example, a 180-day reporting cycle would not be appropriate for a 120-day
     rotation.
     1.5.12. If required, ensure deployed historian is cleared, briefed, and debriefed in Special
     Compartmentalized Information (SCI) prior to and for the duration of their deployment.
1.7. Supporting/Force Provider MAJCOM/HOs provide historians to the service
component commander (See Attachment 3, MAJCOM History Annex). Supporting/Force
Provider MAJCOM/HOs:
AFI 84-102 24 JULY 2013                                                                          7


   1.6.1. Coordinate with the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF historian and direct historians to appropriate
   local functions concerning personnel procedures, entitlements (pay and benefits), security,
   and miscellaneous details.
   1.6.2. Ensure mobility training is complete and current.
   1.6.3. Engage in pre-deployment communication with the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF.
   1.6.4. Ensure historians do not deploy without a validated tasking IAW AFI 10-403, section
   3.15.
   1.6.5. Review and coordinate on AEF scheduling.
   1.6.6. Ensure all historians postured in the AEF libraries are mobility qualified and all
   historians have Top Secret clearances that have been registered in the Joint Personnel
   Accountability System (JPAS). In some instances, SCI access may be required. The gaining
   C-MAJCOM/C-NAF will make that determination.
   1.6.7. Ensure all historians have completed the Historian Training Course.
1.8. AEF Scheduler. The AEF Scheduler coordinates and sources the actual deployment of all
historians during wartime, contingency operations, and large-scale contingency training
exercises. The AEF Scheduler, in coordination with AF/HO:
   1.7.1. Coordinate with AF/HO and the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF to ensure the validity of all
   historian AEF taskings.
   1.7.2. Maintain the AEF Library for all postured historians and coordinates with the
   MAJCOM Functional Area Managers (FAMs) on the training and deployment eligibility of
   their respective assigned historians. At a minimum, this coordination should occur no later
   than 120 days before a given historian’s AEF vulnerability period.
   1.7.3. Coordinates the nomination and selection of historians for specific AEF taskings with
   AF/HO and the historian’s parent MAJCOM. When a historian is sourced for deployment,
   the AEF Scheduler notifies the respective MAJCOM FAM, who in turn validates the tasking.
   1.7.4. Acts as the focal point for the AFHMP leadership on all policy directives and
   guidance issued by the AEF directorate.
   1.7.5. Consults with the AFRC FAM to determine if and when AFRC historians are
   available to support AEF requirements in accordance with AFRC policies and procedures.
1.9. Commanders. Commanders at contingency, humanitarian assistance/disaster recovery,
and other locations affected by this AFI are vital to the success of the AFHMP during wartime
and contingency operations. Commanders:
   1.8.1. Assign historians to their special or personal staff. (T1)
   1.8.2. Provide historians access to all data, activities, and facilities necessary to accomplish
   their mission. (T1)
   1.8.3. Ensure historians are not detailed/assigned duties inconsistent with the timely
   performance of their primary wartime mission. (T2)
   1.8.4. Ensure historians have adequate office space and equipment. (T1)
 8                                                                  AFI 84-102 24 JULY 2013


1.10. Unit Historians. The responsibilities for unit historians’ break down into three distinct
phases: pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment.
     1.9.1. The pre-deployment phase begins when historians are tasked for a deployment. In this
     period, historians:
        1.9.1.1. Complete mobility training requirements as specified by the Unit Deployment
        Manager (UDM). (T1)
        1.9.1.2. Immediately advise the Force Provider MAJCOM/HO FAM about any changes
        that might affect their ability to deploy. (T1)
        1.9.1.3. Periodically brief the commander and staff on the historian’s contingency
        responsibilities. (T3)
        1.9.1.4. Advise the supporting/force provider MAJCOM upon receipt of any deployment
        tasking. Do not deploy without a validated tasking from higher headquarters. (T1)
        1.9.1.5. Obtain and become familiar with supported C-MAJCOM/C-NAF policies,
        procedures, Operating Instructions, and guides prior to deployment. This may require
        attendance at training sessions hosted by the Supported C-MAJCOM/C-NAF prior to
        deployment. (T2)
     1.9.2. During deployments, historians:
        1.9.2.1. Report to the deployed commander, vice commander, or director of staff and
        follow functional guidance and procedures established by the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF
        history office. (T1)
        1.9.2.2. Prepare Contingency Historical Reports (Report Control Symbol (RCS): HAF-
        HO(AR)8901). (T1)
        1.9.2.3. Conduct oral history research interviews. (T1)
        1.9.2.4. Answer queries and provide historical services to the commander and staff. (T1)
        1.9.2.5. Coordinate unit emblem requests with the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF history office.
        (T1)
        1.9.2.6. Advise commanders and staff on lineage and honors data. (T1)
        1.9.2.7. Establish communications with replacement historian. (T1)
     1.9.3. In the post-deployment phase, historians:

        AF Form 2131 (T1)
        1.9.3.2. Coordinate revised home unit history submission schedules with the parent
        MAJCOM/HO. (T2)
     1.9.4. Historians considered deployed-in-place:
        1.9.4.1. Report the unit’s wartime activity (including that of any expeditionary
        organizations formed from personnel and equipment from the parent organizations
        formed from personnel and equipment from the parent organization) within the annual
        history report published under AFI 84-101.
AFI 84-102 24 JULY 2013                                                                      9


   1.9.4.2. Continue reporting under the timelines established by the parent major command or
   higher headquarters.
1.11. National Museum of the United States Air Force (NMUSAF). The NMUSAF will
prepare plans for the collection and disposition of historical property during and after
contingency operations. See AFI 84-103, US Air Force Heritage Program.
1.12. Air Force Reserve Command. AFRC has established command-specific policies and
procedures covering its participation of enlisted and officer historians in the AEF/contingency
deployment process. See the AFRC supplement to this AFI for a detailed discussion of command
guidance and procedures concerning the availability and deployment of AFRC Individual
Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs) and Reserve unit historians.
1.13. Planning. Historians at all levels prepare and maintain History Annexes for contingency
operations plans. Wing-level historians coordinate draft annexes with the MAJCOM/HO. (See
Attachment 4, Unit History Annex Template.) All historians, including those not postured in

                           EXECUTION OF RESPONSIBILTIES

2.1. Historians. Upon reporting to the deployed location, historians establish communications,
collect, organize, safeguard, and preserve historically significant data pertaining to the mission.
To accomplish this, historians:
   2.1.1. Notify the supported C-MAJCOM/C-NAF and the respective parent MAJCOM
   historians by e-mail or phone upon arrival at the contingency location. Historians keep their
   C-MAJCOM/C-NAF historian informed of any changes in the status of contingency reports
   and other issues that may affect mission accomplishment. (T2)
   2.1.2. As circumstances permit, visit geographically separated units (GSUs) and forward
   operating locations (FOLs) regularly to ensure coverage of operational activities. If such
   visits are not possible, contact unit commanders to collect information and conduct
   phone/video teleconference (VTC) interviews when possible. (T3)
   2.1.3. Answer inquiries and maintain an information request log for simple inquiries. Refer
   complex inquiries to the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF history offices. Report the number of
   inquiries and time spent to the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF history offices at the conclusion of the
   deployment.
2.2. Contingency Historical Reports. Contingency reporting procedures differ significantly
from those of peacetime. Unit historians shift from preparing narrative reports to selecting,
organizing, and preserving documentation while preparing a less extensive narrative (see
Attachment 2, Contingency Historical Report (RCS: HAF-HO (M) 8901). Historians focus on
their unit’s operational activities during contingency operations. Historians: (T1)
   2.2.1. Prepare monthly historical reports consisting of a fully-cited expanded chronology, a
   brief narrative, and appendices, which provide key statistical data not otherwise included in
   supporting documents. Maintain cumulative data for statistical appendices to answer queries
   that may extend beyond the reporting period. For example, unit flying hours, sortie
   production, munitions expenditures, and strike data, for monthly, annual, and the duration of
   the operation. (T1)
   2.2.2. Focus on collecting primary electronic source documents. When electronic documents
   are not available, paper files may be collected and preserved. Collect and preserve still and
   video imagery as necessary. (T1)
   2.2.3. Conduct interviews with people directly involved in historically significant phases of
   contingency operations; these serve as a vital source of primary information. Use material
   from interviews in historical reports. Ensure all interviews are included as supporting
   documentation (either as audio files or transcripts) in contingency reports. (T1)
   2.2.4. Notify the appropriate supported C-MAJCOM/C-NAF History Office when each
   contingency history is submitted for the commander’s signature. Upon commander approval,
   disseminate reports as directed by the supported C-MAJCOM/C-NAF historian. (T1)
AFI 84-102 24 JULY 2013                                                                       11


   2.2.5. Maintain one electronic copy of each contingency historical report in the field history
   office. The unit sends one complete copy to the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF History Office, which
   provides a copy to the AFHRA. (T1)
   2.2.6. Do not enter statistical data into charts, tables, and appendices when that data is
   contained in one or more supporting documents. Instead, refer researchers to the appropriate
   supporting document(s). (T2)
2.3. History Operations After-Action Report. Each deployed historian must submit a History
Operation After-Action Report analyzing the effectiveness of historical reporting procedures and
identifying History-related problems and recommended solutions. AARs must be objective
without being overly polemical or tendentious. Historians prepare these reports within 30 days
after returning to duty. Submit copies to AF/HO, the parent MAJCOM historian, and the
AFHRA Field Support Division (AFHRA/FS). AF/HO will coordinate issues derived from these
after-action reports with the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF historians. (T1)

                             TRAINING AND EVALUATION

3.1. AFHRA Field Support Division. The AFHRA/FS teaches historians the principles and
methods needed to prepare Air Force contingency historical reports. To accomplish this,
AFHRA/FS:
   3.1.1. Conducts classroom instruction as part of the Historian Training Course (HTC).
   3.1.2. Incorporates data collected from the Deployment Review Panel and History Operation
   After-Action Reports (AF Form 2131) into the HTC.
   3.1.3. Attends MAJCOM workshops and provides continuation training seminars relating to
   contingency operations.
3.2. MAJCOM Historians. MAJCOM historians support the contingency history process by
conducting contingency training.
3.3. Unit Historians. In order to meet contingency responsibilities and reinforce the important
role they play during contingency operations, unit historians:
   3.3.1. Prepare for and participate in Joint, Air Force, command, and local readiness exercises
   and inspections to practice the skills needed during contingencies. (T1)
   3.3.2. Attend MAJCOM workshops and take part in continuation training. (T2)
   3.3.3. Must have access to a standard desktop compliant computer to use during local
   exercises and deployments. (T1)

           CONTINGENCY HISTORICAL REPORT (RCS: HAF-HO(M)8901)

A2.1. Format. The contingency historical report will consist of Microsoft Office or Adobe
Acrobat files containing fully-cited sources. The report should not contain any embedded files.
   A2.1.1. Title Page.
       A2.1.1.1. Report Control Symbol (RCS), RCS: HAF-HO(M)8901
       A2.1.1.2. Commander’s signature and date signed
       A2.1.1.3. Historian’s signature (optional)
       A2.1.1.4. The full name and location of the unit
       A2.1.1.5. Inclusive dates of the period covered
       A2.1.1.6. Overall classification of the material, with declassification instructions
   A2.1.2. Security Notice and Administrative Controls Page. This page is required on
   every disk of a contingency historical report.
       A2.1.2.1. State the highest classification of material contained on the disk and
       declassification instructions.
       A2.1.2.2. List any special notations that apply to the data in the report.
   A2.1.3. Table of Contents. This is an information-finding aid.
       A2.1.3.1. Must be based on headings/subheadings used in report.
       A2.1.3.2. List by page number.
   A2.1.4. List of Illustrations. List all tables, charts, photographs, and maps.
   A2.1.5. Expanded Chronology. Provides detailed information on significant events in the
   areas of operations, force protection, Base Operating Support, and other events as determined
   by the historian. Events are in chronological order. Each entry should answer the “who, what,
   when, where, why, and how” of an event. Do not use a bullet format; each entry must be
   narrative in nature.
   A2.1.6. Narrative: A topically-organized account of significant events that occurred during
   the reporting period or of activities spanning multiple reporting periods. While the
   chronology provides adequate coverage of specific events, the narrative is the proper place to
   summarize a series of related events or a category of activities. For example, adequate
   coverage of an airlift or strike mission can be accomplished within the expanded chronology,
   but the narrative would be the appropriate section for a summary of measures taken to
   improve base security or to streamline maintenance procedures.
       A2.1.6.1. When possible, examine events in past contingency history reports to identify
       trends, lessons learned, and mission performance.
       A2.1.6.2. Every entry must have a citation identifying its sources. Supporting documents
       may be hyperlinked, but it is not mandatory. Be consistent; hyperlink all supporting
       documents or do not hyperlink any of the supporting documents.
AFI 84-102 24 JULY 2013                                                                        17


      A2.1.6.3. Do not embed photographs in the history. The historian will provide a caption
      and may hyperlink the text to a corresponding digital photograph or similar multimedia
      file. Each photograph or similar multimedia file requires a source citation.
   A2.1.7. Appendices. Appropriate items for appendices include charts, tables, graphs, and
   statistical summaries, but do not enter statistical data into appendices when that data is
   contained in one or more supporting documents. Instead, refer researchers to the appropriate
   supporting document(s). When relying upon supporting documents alone, compile
   cumulative data enabling historians to readily answer inquiries. For example, include
   cumulative statistics broken down by month, year, and operation. Appendices follow the
   same format and contain the same information as specified in AFI 84-101, Historical
   Products, Services, and Requirements. Follow these guidelines:
      A2.1.7.1. An appendix must be able to stand alone as an independent document when
      extracted from the history.
      A2.1.7.2. List all sources used for its data and, if classified, provide downgrade and
      declassification instructions.
      A2.1.7.3. The following appendices are mandatory and identified by a capital letter.
      When not applicable, insert the phrase “This Appendix not used.” Additionally, with the
      approval of the supported C-MAJCOM/C-NAF History Office, historians may include
      other appendices as needed. C/MAJCOMs/C-NAFS may add other appendices as
      required. Do not create a table with manually entered data if an existing spreadsheet can
      be used. Also, an appendix can consist of a document link or a hyperlink to a source
      document if the linked document contains all the data needed in the appendix.

   A2.1.10. List of Supporting Documents/Document Groups/Case Files. The first disk in
   any history contains a list of all documents, document groups, or case files included as part of
   the history. Provide the identifying information and highest/most restrictive classification
   data like that used in a note citation. When using case files, you must ascertain the highest
   classification and most restrictive dissemination restrictions, as well as the longest duration
   declassification instruction for each case file. For additional supporting document disks, list
   only the documents contained on that disk, giving the same information required above.

A2.1.12.9. Destination (i.e., USAFE/HO).
A2.2. Research Topics. All manner of topics and events come under the purview of historians,
but only significant activities affecting mission accomplishment merit discussion. By employing
historical perspective, consider information that will be useful to future planners. The
subheadings below, while neither inclusive nor exclusive, indicate topics generally worthy of
consideration for historical coverage.
   A2.2.1. Mission and organization changes and authority; assigned and attached units; host
   unit and host nation relationships.
   A2.2.2. Operational tasking (offensive counter air, defensive counter air, close air support,
   intelligence surveillance reconnaissance, cyberspace, etc.).
   A2.2.3. Hostile activities: enemy aircraft sighted or engaged (date, place, type, action taken);
   enemy ground forces observed or engaged (date, place, type--missiles, gun emplacements,
