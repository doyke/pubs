                    INTRODUCTION TO DRILL AND CEREMONIES

1.1. Scope.
   1.1.1. This manual includes most Air Force needs in drill and ceremonies, but it does not
   cover every situation that may arise. For unusual situations, using good judgment and taking
   into account the purpose of the movement or procedure can often provide the solution.
   1.1.2. Units or organizations required to drill under arms will use the procedures in US
   Army Field Manual 22-5, Drill and Ceremonies, SECNAV 5060.22, Marine Corps Drill and
   Ceremonies Manual, or Air Force Academy Cadet Wing Manual 50-5. The types of weapon
   used will determine the appropriate manual. (T-2).
1.2. Introduction to Drill.
   1.2.1. For the purpose of drill, Air Force organizations are divided into elements, flights,
   squadrons, groups, and wings (The wing does not drill by direct command).
   1.2.2. Drill consists of certain movements by which the flight or squadron is moved in an
   orderly manner from one formation to another or from one place to another. Standards such
   as the 24-inch step, cadence of 100 to 120 steps per minute, distance, and interval have been
   established to ensure movements are executed with order and precision. The task of each
   person is to learn these movements and execute each part exactly as described. Individuals
   also must learn to adapt their own movements to those of the group. Everyone in the
   formation must move together on command.
1.3. Introduction to Ceremonies.
   1.3.1. Ceremonies are special, formal, group activities conducted by the Armed Forces to
   honor distinguished persons or recognize special events. Ceremonies also demonstrate the
   proficiency and training state of the troops.
   1.3.2. Ceremonies are an extension of drill activities. The precision marching, promptness
   in responding to commands, and teamwork developed on the drill field determine the
   appearance and performance of the group in ceremonies.
1.4. Key to Symbols. Symbols used in this manual are defined and shown in Figure 1.1
 10                                                    AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013

1.5. Drill Instruction.
   1.5.1. For drill instruction, movement of troops, and other formations, the senior member
   present will assume the leadership position. When possible, do not place persons of higher
   grade in positions subordinate to the instructor or person in charge of the drill or formation.
   1.5.2. Use the following step-by-step procedures to teach drill movements:
       1.5.2.1. State the name of the movement to be executed, and point out its purpose.
       1.5.2.2. Demonstrate the movement to the formation, using the proper cadence and
       commands.
       1.5.2.3. Explain and demonstrate the movement in detail.
       1.5.2.4. Ask questions on the movement, then demonstrate the movement again as in
       paragraph 1.5.2.2 when further clarification is needed.
       1.5.2.5. Have the formation perform the movement and make on-the-spot corrections.
       1.5.2.6. Critique the performance of the movement and review important areas before
       moving on to the next exercise.
   1.5.3. BY THE NUMBERS is the method in which precision movements of two or more
   counts are demonstrated, practiced, and learned--one count at a time.
       1.5.3.1. This method enables the student to learn a movement step by step and permits
       the instructor to make detailed corrections. The instructor commands BY THE
       NUMBERS before giving commands for the movement; for example, BY THE
       NUMBERS, About, FACE. The first count of the movement is executed on the
       command FACE. The second count is executed on the command Ready, TWO (the pivot
       is the second count).
       1.5.3.2. All subsequent movements are executed by the numbers until the command
       WITHOUT THE NUMBERS is given. For example, in teaching right and left face, the
       command BY THE NUMBERS is given at the beginning of the practice exercise. Each
       facing is repeated by the numbers until the instructor gives WITHOUT THE
       NUMBERS. Subsequent movements are executed in the cadence of quick time.

                      COMMANDS AND THE COMMAND VOICE

Section 2A—Commands

2.1. Types of Commands.
   2.1.1. A drill command is an oral order. Most drill commands have two parts, the
   preparatory command and the command of execution. In this manual, the first letter of
   preparatory command is capitalized and printed in boldface (Squadron), and the command
   of execution is printed in all caps and boldface (ATTENTION).
      2.1.1.1. The preparatory command explains what the movement will be. When calling a
      unit to attention or halting a unit’s march, the preparatory command includes the unit’s
      designation. In the command Flight, HALT, the word Flight is the preparatory
      command. At the same time, it designates the unit.
      2.1.1.2. The command of execution follows the preparatory command. The command of
      execution explains when the movement will be carried out. In Forward, MARCH, the
      command of execution is MARCH.
      2.1.1.3. In certain commands, the preparatory command and the command of execution
      are combined, for example: FALL IN, AT EASE, and REST. These commands are
      given at a uniformly high pitch and a louder volume than that of a normal command of
      execution.
   2.1.2. Supplementary commands are given when one unit of the element must execute a
   movement different from the other units or must execute the same movement at a different
   time. Two examples are CONTINUE THE MARCH and STAND FAST.
   2.1.3. Informational commands have no preparatory command or command of execution,
   and they are not supplementary. Two examples are PREPARE FOR INSPECTION,
   COLUMN OF FILES and DISMISS THE SQUADRON.
2.2. General Rules for Commands.
   2.2.1. When giving commands, the leader is at the position of attention. Good military
   bearing is necessary for good leadership. While marching, the leader must be in step with the
   formation at all times.
   2.2.2. The commander faces the formation when giving commands except when the element
   is part of a larger drill element or when the commander is relaying or echoing commands in a
   ceremony. When the commander is a member of a staff or detail and is required to perform a
   movement at the same time as the formation, the commander will maintain the same position
   as the formation while giving commands and will respond to his/her command.
   2.2.3. When a command requires a unit to execute a movement different from other units (or
   the same movement at a different time), the subordinate commander gives a supplementary
   command over the right shoulder. Supplementary commands are given between the element
   commander’s preparatory command and command of execution. When the squadron
 12                                                  AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   commander’s preparatory command is Squadron, the flight commander’s preparatory
   command is Flight.
   2.2.4. When flights of a squadron are to execute a movement in order, such as a column
   movement, the flight commander of A Flight repeats the squadron commander’s preparatory
   command. The commanders of the other flights give a supplementary command, such as
   CONTINUE THE MARCH. When the squadron commander gives the command of
   execution, A Flight executes the movement; and, at the command of the appropriate flight
   commander, each of the following flights executes the movement at approximately the same
   location and in the same manner as A Flight.
   2.2.5. Use the command AS YOU WERE to revoke a preparatory command. After the
   command of execution has been given and the movement has begun, give other appropriate
   commands to bring the element to the desired position. If a command is improperly given,
   the individuals execute the movement to the best of their ability.
   2.2.6. When giving commands, flight commanders may add the letter of their flight to the
   command, such as A Flight, HALT or B Flight, Forward, MARCH. When commands are
   given to a squadron in which one flight stands fast or continues to march, the flight
   commander commands STAND FAST or CONTINUE THE MARCH, as appropriate.
   2.2.7. The preparatory command and the command of execution are given as the heel of the
   foot corresponding to the direction of the movement strikes the ground.

Section 2B—The Command Voice

2.3. Voice Characteristics. The way a command is given affects the way the movement is
executed. A correctly delivered command is loud and distinct enough for everyone in the
element to hear. It is given in a tone, cadence, and snap that demand a willing, correct, and
immediate response. A voice with the right qualities of loudness, projection, distinctness,
inflection, and snap enables a commander to obtain effective results as shown below.
   2.3.1. Loudness. This is the volume used in giving a command. It should be adjusted to the
   distance and number of individuals in the formation. The commander takes a position in
   front of, and centered on, the unit and facing the unit so his or her voice reaches all
   individuals. Speak loudly enough for all to hear, but do not strain the vocal cords.
       2.3.1.1. The most important muscle used in breathing is the diaphragm, the large,
       powerful muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. The
       diaphragm automatically controls the breath when giving commands.
       2.3.1.2. Deep breathing exercises develop the diaphragm and refresh the entire body.
       The following exercise will develop improved breathing techniques for giving
       commands. Take a deep breath through the mouth and hold the air in the lungs. With
       relaxed throat muscles, say huh and ha in as short a time as possible. Make the sounds
       entirely by expelling short puffs of air from the lungs. Use only the diaphragm and
       muscles around the waist. When you do this properly, you can feel a distinct movement
       of the abdominal muscles. Practice this exercise often. As a result, you can increase
       effort and volume until they are natural. Another excellent exercise for developing and
       strengthening the muscular walls of the diaphragm is shown in Figure 2.1
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 13


     2.3.1.3. The cavities of the throat, mouth, and nose act as amplifiers and help give
     fullness (resonance) and projection to the voice.
     2.3.1.4. To obtain resonance, keep your throat relaxed, loosen your lower jaw, and open
     your mouth. You can then prolong the vowel sounds.
  2.3.2. Projection. This is the ability of your voice to reach whatever distance is desired
  without undue strain. To project the command, focus your voice on the person farthest away.
  Counting in a full, firm voice and giving commands at a uniform cadence while prolonging
  the syllables are good exercises. Erect posture, proper breathing, a relaxed throat, and an
  open mouth help project the voice.
  2.3.3. Distinctness. This depends on the correct use of the tongue, lips, and teeth to form the
  separate sounds of a word and to group those sounds to force words. Distinct commands are
  effective; indistinct commands cause confusion. Emphasize clear enunciation.
 14                                               AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


Figure 2.1. Diaphragm Exercise.




   2.3.4. Inflection. This is the change in pitch of the voice. Pronounce the preparatory
   command—the command that announces the movement--with a rising inflection near or at
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   15


   the end of its completion, usually the last syllable. When beginning a preparatory command,
   the most desirable pitch of voice is near the level of the natural speaking voice. A common
   fault is to start the preparatory command so high that, after employing a rising inflection, the
   passage to a higher pitch for the command of execution is impossible without undue strain.
   A properly delivered command of execution has no inflection. However, it should be given
   at a higher pitch than the preparatory command. Some commands are portrayed graphically
   in Figure 2.2
   2.3.5. Snap. This is that extra quality in a command that demands immediate response. It
   expresses confidence and decisiveness. It indicates complete control of yourself and the
   situation. To achieve this quality, you must have knowledge of commands and the ability to
   voice them effectively. Give the command of execution at the precise instant the heel of the
   proper foot strikes the ground while marching. Achieve snap in giving commands by
   standing erect, breathing without effort, and speaking clearly.
2.4. Cadence.
   2.4.1. Cadence is the measure or beat of movement. Commanders must match the rhythm of
   their commands with the cadence of their unit. The interval that produces the best effect in a
   movement is the one that allows one step between the preparatory command and the
   command of execution. In some instances, you should lengthen the interval enough to permit
   proper understanding of the movement to be executed and allow for supplementary
   commands when necessary. Measure the interval exactly in the beat of the drill cadence.
   2.4.2. When marching, give commands for executing movements to the right when the right
   foot strikes the ground; give commands for executing movements to the left when the left
   foot strikes the ground. In commands containing two or more words, place the point of
   emphasis on the last word. For example, in Right Flank, give the command Flank as the
   right foot hits the ground.
   2.4.3. For a squadron or larger unit, the interval between the squadron or group
   commander’s preparatory command and the command of execution should be long enough to
   allow the marching elements to take three steps between commands.
2.5. Counting Cadence.
   2.5.1. The instructor counts cadence to acquaint students with cadence rhythm. When
   trainees get out of step, the instructor either corrects them by counting cadence or halts the
   element and then moves them off in step. Counting cadence helps teach coordination and
   rhythm. Cadence is given in sets of two as follows: HUT, TOOP, THREEP, FOURP;
   HUT, TOOP, THREEP, FOURP. To help keep in step, unit members should keep the
   head up and watch the head and shoulders of the person directly in front of them.
   2.5.2. The command for the element to count cadence is Count Cadence, COUNT. Give
   the command of execution as the left foot strikes the ground. The next time the left foot
   strikes the ground, the group counts cadence for eight steps, as follows: ONE, TWO,
   THREE, FOUR; ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. Do not shout the counts. Give them
   sharply and clearly, and separate each number distinctly.

Figure 2.2. Commands Portrayed Graphically.




   2.5.3. In counting cadence in the movement Right Step, the count of ONE is given on the
   right foot because the right foot is moved first.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                17


2.6. Mass Commands.
   2.6.1. Mass commands help develop confidence, self-reliance, assertiveness, and enthusiasm
   by making the individual recall, give, and execute the proper commands. Mass commands
   are usually confined to simple movements with short preparatory commands and commands
   of execution executed simultaneously by all elements of a unit.
   2.6.2. Each person is required to give commands in unison with others as if that person alone
   were giving commands to the entire element. The volume of the combined voices
   encourages every person to perform the movement with snap and precision.
   2.6.3. When the instructor wants to conduct drill by mass commands, the command is AT
   YOUR COMMAND. For each exercise and cadence drill, the instructor announces the
   movement to be executed and commands the element COMMAND. Personnel then give the
   commands and execute them in unison.
   2.6.4. The following are examples of mass commands:
Instructor: AT YOUR COMMAND, Call the Flight to Attention, COMMAND.
Mass:     Flight, ATTENTION.
Instructor: Have the Flight Stand at Parade Rest, COMMAND.
Mass:     Parade, REST.
Instructor: March the Flight Forward, COMMAND.
Mass:     Forward, MARCH.
Instructor: Halt the Flight, COMMAND.
Mass:     Flight, HALT.
   2.6.5. When desiring to end mass commands, the instructor commands AT MY
   COMMAND.

                                INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTION

3.1. Positions and Movements. This chapter explains, by word and picture, certain basic
positions and movements.
3.2. Position of Attention. To come to attention, bring the heels together smartly and on line.
Place the heels as near each other as the conformation of the body permits, and ensure the feet
are turned out equally, forming a 45-degree angle. Keep the legs straight without stiffening or
locking the knees. The body is erect with hips level, chest lifted, back arched, and shoulders
square and even. Arms hang straight down alongside the body without stiffness, and the wrists
are straight with the forearms. Place thumbs, which are resting along the first joint of the
forefinger, along the seams of the trousers or sides of the skirt. Hands are cupped (but not
clenched as a fist) with palms facing the leg (Figure 3.1.). The head is kept erect and held
straight to the front with the chin drawn in slightly so the axis of the head and neck is vertical;
eyes are to the front, with the line of sight parallel to the ground. The weight of the body rests
equally on the heels and balls of both feet, and silence and immobility are required.

Figure 3.1. Position of Attention.




3.3. Rest Positions.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  19


   3.3.1. Execute rests (parade rest, at ease, rest, and fall out) from a halt and only from the
   position of attention as follows:
      3.3.1.1. Parade Rest. The command is Parade, REST. On the command REST, the
      airman will raise the left foot from the hip just enough to clear the ground and move it
      smartly to the left so the heels are 12 inches apart, as measured from the inside of the
      heels. Keep the legs straight, but not stiff, and the heels on line. As the left foot moves,
      bring the arms, fully extended, to the back of the body, uncapping the hands in the
      process; and extend and join the fingers, pointing them toward the ground. The palms
      will face outwards. Place the right hand in the palm of the left, right thumb over the left
      to form an “X” (Figure 3.2). Keep head and eyes straight ahead, and remain silent and
      immobile.

Figure 3.2. Parade Rest.




      3.3.1.2. At Ease. The command is AT EASE. On the command AT EASE, airmen may
      relax in a standing position, but they must keep the right foot in place. Their position in
      the formation will not change, and silence will be maintained.
      3.3.1.3. Rest. The command is REST. On the command REST, the same requirements
      for at ease apply, but moderate speech is permitted.
      3.3.1.4. Fall Out. The command is FALL OUT. On the command FALL OUT,
      individuals may relax in a standing position or break ranks. They must remain in the
 20                                                       AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


       immediate area, and no specific method of dispersal is required. Moderate speech is
       permitted.
   3.3.2. To resume the position of attention from any of the rests (except fall out), the
   command is (for example) Flight, ATTENTION. On the command Flight, the airmen
   assume the position of parade rest; and at the command ATTENTION, they assume the
   position of attention.
3.4. Facings Movements. Execute facing movements from a halt, at the position of attention,
and in the cadence of quick time. Perform facing movements in two counts.
   3.4.1. Right (Left) Face. The commands are Right (Left), FACE. On the command FACE,
   raise the right (left) toe and left (right) heel slightly and pivot 90 degrees to the right (left) on
   the ball of the left (right) foot and the heel of the right (left) foot, assisted by slight pressure
   on the ball of the left (right) foot. Keep legs straight, but not stiff. The upper portion of the
   body remains at attention. This completes count one of the movement. Next, bring the left
   (right) foot smartly forward, ensuring heels are together and on line. Feet should now be
   forming a 45-degree angle, which means the position of attention has been resumed (Figure
   3.3). This completes count two of the movement.

Figure 3.3. Right Face.




   3.4.2. About Face. The command is About, FACE. On the command FACE, lift the right
   foot from the hip just enough to clear the ground. Without bending the knees, place the ball
   of the right foot approximately half a shoe length behind and slightly to the left of the heel.
   Distribute the weight of the body on the ball of the right foot and the heel of the left foot.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   21


   Keep both legs straight, but not stiff. The position of the foot has not changed. This
   completes count one of the movement. Keeping the upper portion of the body at the position
   of attention, pivot 180 degrees to the right on the ball of the right foot and heel of the left
   foot, with a twisting motion from the hips. Suspend arm swing during the movement, and
   remain as though at attention. On completion of the pivot, heels should be together and on
   line and feet should form a 45-degree angle. The entire body is now at the position of
   attention (Figure 3.4). This completes count two of the movement.

Figure 3.4. About Face.




   3.4.3. Half Right (Left) Face. When instructions are given for 45-degree movements, the
   command Half Right (Left), FACE may be used. The procedures described in paragraph
   3.4.1 are used except each person executes the movement by facing 45 degrees to the right or
   left.
3.5. Hand Salute. This is used for training purposes only. The command is Hand, SALUTE,
and it is performed in two counts. On the command SALUTE, the individual raises the right
hand smartly in the most direct manner while at the same time extending and joining the fingers.
Keep the palm flat and facing the body. Place the thumb along the forefingers, keeping the palm
flat and forming a straight line between the fingertips and elbows (Figure 3.5). Tilt the palm
slightly toward the face. Hold the upper arm horizontal, slightly forward of the body and parallel
to the ground. Ensure the tip of the middle finger touches the right front corner of the headdress.
 22                                                   AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


If wearing a non-billed hat, ensure the middle finger touches the outside corner of the right
eyebrow or the front corner of glasses. The rest of the body will remain at the position of
attention. This is count one of the movement. To complete count two of the movement, bring
the arm smoothly and smartly downward, retracing the path used to raise the arm. Cup the hand
as it passes the waist, and return to the position of attention.

Figure 3.5. Hand Salute.




3.6. Exchange of Salutes. The salute is a courteous exchange of greetings, with the junior
member always saluting first. When returning or rendering an individual salute, the head and
eyes are turned toward the Colors or person saluted. When in ranks, the position of attention is
maintained unless otherwise directed. Members of the Armed Forces in uniform exchange
salutes under the following conditions:
   3.6.1. Outdoors, salutes are exchanged upon recognition between officers and warrant
   officers and between officers or warrant officers and cadets or enlisted members of the
   Armed Forces. Saluting outdoors means salutes are exchanged when the persons involved
   are outside of a building. For example, if a person is on a porch, a covered sidewalk, a bus
   stop, a covered or open entryway, or a reviewing stand, the salute will be exchanged with a
   person on the sidewalk outside of the structure or with a person approaching or in the same
   structure. This applies both on and off military installations. The junior member should
   initiate the salute in time to allow the senior officer to return it. To prescribe an exact
   distance for all circumstances is not practical, but good judgment indicates when salutes
   should be exchanged. A superior who is carrying articles in both hands need not return the
   salute, but he or she should nod in return or verbally acknowledge the salute. If the junior
   member is carrying articles in both hands, verbal greetings should be exchanged. Also, use
   these procedures when greeting an officer of a friendly foreign nation.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   23


   3.6.2. Indoors, except for formal reporting, salutes are not rendered.
   3.6.3. In formation, members do not salute or return a salute unless given the command to do
   so. Normally the person in charge salutes and acknowledges salutes for the whole formation.
   3.6.4. In groups, but not in formation, when a senior officer approaches, the first individual
   noticing the officer calls the group to attention. All members face the officer and salute. If
   the officer addresses an individual or the group, all remain at attention (unless otherwise
   ordered) until the end of the conversation, at which time they salute the officer.
   3.6.5. In public gatherings, such as sporting events, meetings, or when a salute would be
   inappropriate or impractical, salutes between individuals need not be rendered.
   3.6.6. Exchange of salutes between military pedestrians (including gate sentries) and officers
   in moving military vehicles is not mandatory. However, when officer passengers are readily
   identifiable (for example, officers in appropriately marked vehicles), the salute must be
   rendered.
   3.6.7. Civilians may be saluted by persons in uniform. The President of the United States, as
   Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, is always accorded the honor of a salute. Also, if
   the exchange of salutes is otherwise appropriate, it is customary for military members in
   civilian clothes to exchange salutes upon recognition.
   3.6.8. Prisoners whose sentences include punitive discharges do not render the salute. All
   other prisoners, regardless of custody or grade, render the prescribed salute except when
   under armed guard.
   3.6.9. In a work detail, individual workers do not salute. The person in charge salutes for the
   entire detail.
   3.6.10. Any airman, NCO, or officer recognizing a need to salute or a need to return one
   may do so anywhere at any time.
3.7. Present Arms and Order Arms. The commands are Present, ARMS and Order ARMS.
On the command Present, ARMS, the airman executes the first count of hand salute. Count two
of hand salute is performed when given the command Order, ARMS.
3.8. Eyes Right (Left) and Ready Front. The commands are Eyes, RIGHT (LEFT) and
Ready, FRONT. These commands may be given at a halt or while marching. The preparatory
command and command of execution are given on the right (left) foot while marching. On the
command RIGHT (LEFT), all persons, except those on the right (left) flank, turn their heads
and eyes smartly 45 degrees to the right (left) (Figure 3.6). To return their heads and eyes to the
front, the command Ready, FRONT is given as the left (right) foot strikes the ground. On the
command FRONT, heads and eyes are turned smartly to the front (figure 3.7).

Figure 3.6. Eyes Right.




3.9. Steps and Marching:
   3.9.1. When executed from a halt, all steps and marching begin with the left foot, except
   right step and close march.
   3.9.2. Both the preparatory command and the command of execution are given as the foot in
   the direction of the turn strikes the ground (Figure 3.8). For units no larger than a flight, the
   preparatory command is normally given as the heel of the left (right) foot strikes the ground,
   and the command of execution is given when the heel of the left (right) foot next strikes the
   ground.
   3.9.3. For units larger than a flight, time is allowed for the subordinate commanders to give
   appropriate supplementary commands. The pause between commands is three paces.
3.10. Forward March and Halt.
   3.10.1. To march forward in quick time from a halt, the command is Forward, MARCH.
   On the command MARCH, the airman smartly steps off straight ahead with the left foot,
   taking a 24-inch step (measured from heel to heel), and places the heel on the ground first.
   When stepping off and while marching, the airman will use coordinated arm swing; that is,
   right arm forward with the left leg and left arm forward with the right leg. The hands will be
   cupped with the thumbs pointed down, and the arms will hang straight, but not stiff, and will
   swing naturally. The swing of the arms will measure 6 inches to the front (measured from
   the rear of the hand to the front of the thigh) and 3 inches to the rear (measured from the front
   of the hand to the back of the thigh) (Figure 3.9). If applicable, proper dress, cover, interval,
   and distance will be maintained; and cadence will be adhered to. Count cadence as follows:
   counts one and three are given as the heel of the left foot strikes the ground and counts two
   and four are given as the heel of the right foot strikes the ground.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 25


Figure 3.7. Ready Front.




   3.10.2. To halt from quick time, the command is Flight, HALT, given as either foot strikes
   the ground. On the command HALT, the airman will take one more 24-inch step. Next, the
   trailing foot will be brought smartly alongside the front foot. The heels will be together, on
   line, and form a 45-degree angle. Coordinated arm swing will cease as the weight of the
   body shifts to the leading foot when halting.
3.11. Double Time.
   3.11.1. To march in double time from a halt or when marching in quick time, the command
   is Double Time, MARCH.
   3.11.2. When halted and on the command MARCH, the airman begins with the left foot,
   raises the forearms to a horizontal position along the waistline, cups the hands with the
   knuckles out, and begins an easy run of 180 steps per minute with 30-inch steps, measured
   from heel to heel. Coordinated motion of the arms is maintained throughout (Figure 3.10).

Figure 3.8. Command for Column Left and Column Right Movements.




   3.11.3. When marching in quick time and on the command MARCH (given as either foot
   strikes the ground), the airman takes one more step in quick time and then steps off in double
   time.
   3.11.4. To resume quick time from double time, the command is Quick Time, MARCH,
   with four steps between commands. On the command MARCH (given as either foot strikes
   the ground), the airman advances two more steps in double time, resumes quick time, lowers
   the arms to the sides, and resumes coordinated arm swing.
   3.11.5. To halt from double time, the command Flight, HALT is given as either foot strikes
   the ground, with four steps between commands. The airman will take two more steps in
   double time and halt in two counts at quick time, lowering the arms to the sides.
   3.11.6. The only commands that can be given while in double time are Incline To The
   Right (Left); Quick Time, MARCH; and Flight, HALT.
3.12. Mark Time.
   3.12.1. The command is Mark Time, MARCH. When marching, the command MARCH is
   given as either foot strikes the ground. The airman takes one more 24-inch step with the
   right (left) foot. He or she then brings the trailing foot to a position so both heels are on line.
   The cadence is continued by alternately raising and lowering each foot. The balls of the feet
   are raised 4 inches above the ground. Normal arm swing is maintained.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                27


Figure 3.9. Quick Time.




   3.12.2. At a halt, on the command MARCH, the airman raises and lowers first the left foot
   and then the right. Mark time is executed in quick time only. The halt executed from mark
   time is similar to the halt from quick time.
   3.12.3. To resume marching, the command Forward, MARCH is given as the heel of the
   left foot strikes the ground. The airman takes one more step in place and then steps off in a
   full 24-inch step with the left foot.
3.13. Half Step.
 28                                                     AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


Figure 3.10. Double Time.




   3.13.1. The command Half Step, MARCH is given as either foot strikes the ground. On the
   command MARCH, the airman takes one more 24-inch steps followed by a 12-inch step
   (measured from heel to heel) in quick time, setting the heel down first without scraping the
   ground. The airman maintains coordinated arm swing and continues the half step until
   marched forward or halted.
   3.13.2. To resume a full 24-inch step, the command Forward, MARCH is given as the heel
   of the left foot strikes the ground. On the command MARCH, the airman takes one more
   12-inch step with the right foot and then steps out with a full 24-inch step with the left foot.
   3.13.3. The halt executed from half step is similar to the halt executed from a 24-inch step.
   The half step is not executed from the halt nor is changes of direction made from the half
   step. It is executed only in quick time, and normal arm swing is maintained.
3.14. Right (Left) Step.
   3.14.1. The command is Right (Left) Step, MARCH, given only from a halt and for
   moving short distances. On the command MARCH, the airman raises the right (left) leg
   from the hip just high enough to clear the ground. The leg will be kept straight, but not stiff,
   throughout the movement. The individual places the right (left) foot 12 inches, as measured
   from the inside of the heels, to the right (left) of the left (right) foot. Transfer the weight of
   the body to the right (left) foot, then bring the left (right) foot (without scraping the ground)
   smartly to a position alongside the right (left) foot as in the position of attention. This
   movement is continued in quick time; the upper portion of the body remains at attention and
   arms remain at the sides throughout.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                       29


   3.14.2. Cadence may be counted during this movement. Counts one and three are given as
   the right (left) foot strikes the ground. Counts two and four are given as the heels come
   together.
   3.14.3. To halt from the right (left) step, the preparatory command and command of
   execution are given as the heels come together. The halt from the right (left) step is executed
   in two counts. On the command HALT, one more step is taken with the right (left) foot and
   the left (right) foot is placed smartly alongside the right (left) foot as in the position of
   attention.
3.15. Change Step. The command is Change Step, MARCH. On the command MARCH,
given as the right foot strikes the ground, the airman takes one more 24-inch step with the left
foot. Then in one count, place the ball of the right foot alongside the heel of the left foot,
suspend arm swing, and shift the weight of the body to the right foot. Step off with the left foot
in a 24-inch step, resuming coordinated arm swing. The upper portion of the body remains at the
position of attention throughout.
3.16. To the Rear March. The command is To the Rear, MARCH, given as the heel of the
right foot strikes the ground. On the command MARCH, the airman takes a 12-inch step with
the left foot, placing it in front of and in line with the right foot and distributes the weight of the
body on the balls of both feet. Then pivot on the balls of both feet, turning 180 degrees to the
right, and take a 12-inch step with the left foot in the new direction, with coordinated arm swing,
before taking a full 24-inch step with the right foot. While pivoting, do not force the body up or
lean forward. The pivot takes a full count and the arm swing is suspended to the sides as the
weight of the body comes forward while executing the pivot, as if at the position of attention.
3.17. Flanking Movement. The command is Right (Left) Flank, MARCH, given as the heel
of the right (left) foot strikes the ground. On the command MARCH, the airman takes one more
24-inch step, pivots 90 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the left (right) foot, keeping the
upper portion of the body at the position of attention. Then step off with the right (left) foot in
the new direction of march with a full 24-inch step and coordinated arm swing. Arm swing is
suspended to the sides as the weight of the body comes forward on the pivot foot. The pivot and
step off are executed in one count. This movement is used for a quick movement to the right or
left for short distances only. Throughout the movement, maintain proper dress, cover, interval,
and distance.
3.18. Face in Marching. The command is Right (Left) Flank, MARCH. On the command
MARCH, the airman executes a 90-degree pivot on the ball of the right (left) foot and, at the
same time, steps off with the left (right) foot in the new direction with coordinated arm swing.
The pivot and step are executed in one count, and proper dress, cover, interval, and distance are
maintained.
3.19. Marching Other Than at Attention. The commands below may be given as the heel of
either foot strikes the ground as long as both the preparatory command and command of
execution are given on the same foot and only from quick time. The only command that can be
given when marching at other than attention is Incline to the Right (Left). Specific instructions
may be given to maintain control of the flight. Example: Guide, incline 90 degrees to the
Right; Guide, incline 45 degrees to the Left. Otherwise, the flight must be called to attention
before other commands may be given.

  3.19.1. Route Step March. The command is Route Step, MARCH. On the command
  MARCH, the airman takes one more 24-inch step and assumes route step. Neither silence
  nor cadence is required, and movement is permitted as long as dress, cover, interval, and
  distance are maintained.
  3.19.2. At Ease March. The command is At Ease, MARCH. On the command MARCH,
  the airman takes one more 24-inch step and assumes at ease. Cadence is not given, and
  movement is permitted as long as silence, dress, cover, interval, and distance are maintained.

                                   DRILL OF THE FLIGHT

Section 4A—Formations

4.1. The Flight as the Basic Drill Unit. The first phase of drill involves teaching the airman
basic movements, facings, and positions, either as an individual or as a member of an element.
The second phase of drill merges the individual with others to form a flight in which base
formations and marchings are learned. The flight is composed of at least two, but not more than
four, elements. This formation is the most practical drill group. In flight drill, the positions of
the flight commander, flight sergeant, and guide assume importance. For the purposes of
instruction, the drill instructor may assume any of these titles and positions. When in column,
the flight is sized according to height, with the tallest individuals to the front and right. Make
every effort to retain individuals of the highest grade in positions occupied by element leaders
and guides.
4.2. Rules for the Guide.
   4.2.1. The guide sets the direction and cadence of the march. The guide of the leading flight
   of a squadron marching in column sets the direction and cadence of march for the squadron.
   4.2.2. When a flight in line is commanded to face to the right, the guide executes right face
   with the flight. The guide then performs a face in marching to the right, marches to a position
   in front of the right file, halts, and executes a left face.
   4.2.3. When a flight marching in column is commanded to flank to the left or right or march
   to the rear, the guide executes the movement. The relative position of the guide does not
   change within the flight except when the flight is halted in line in such a manner that the
   guide is not abreast of the front rank. The guide then moves to a position abreast of the front
   rank.
   4.2.4. Unless otherwise announced, the position of the guide within a flight, in line or in
   column, marching or halted, is right. The position of the guide within a flight, in inverted
   line is to the left, next to the element leader of the base file. The position of the guide in
   inverted line is behind the element leader of the base file. When it is desired to change the
   base for a movement, the new position of the guide is assigned preceding the preparatory
   command for the movement. The dress is always to the base element.
   4.2.5. When the flight is in column and it is desired to position the guide to the left, the
   command GUIDE LEFT is given. On this command, the guide and flight commander
   exchange positions by passing right shoulder to right shoulder. To return the guide to the
   normal position, GUIDE RIGHT is given. The guide and flight commander return to their
   normal positions by again passing right shoulder to right shoulder. The movement can be
   made either at a halt or while marching.
   4.2.6. Normally, the flight is marched with the element leaders and the guide at the head of
   the column.
4.3. Formation of the Flight.

   4.3.1. A flight forms in at least two, but not more than four, elements in line formation
   (figure 4.1). The command is FALL IN.
      4.3.1.1. On this command, the guide takes a position facing the flight sergeant and to the
      flight sergeants left so the first element will fall in centered on and three paces from the
      flight sergeant. Once halted at the position of attention, the guide performs an automatic
      dress right dress. When the guide feels the presence of the first element leader on his or
      her fingertips, the guide executes an automatic ready front. Once positioned, the guide
      does not move.
      4.3.1.2. The first element leader falls in directly to the left of the guide and, once halted,
      executes an automatic dress right dress. The second, third, and fourth element leaders
      fall in behind the first element leader, execute an automatic dress right dress, visually
      establish a 40-inch distance, and align themselves directly behind the individual in front
      of them. The remaining airmen fall into any open position to the left of the element
      leaders and execute an automatic dress right dress to establish dress and cover.

Figure 4.1. Flight in Line Formation.




      4.3.1.3. To establish interval, the leading individual in each file obtains exact shoulder-
      to-fingertip contact with the individual to his or her immediate right (figure 4.2). As
      soon as dress, cover, interval, and distance are established, each airman executes an
      automatic ready front on an individual basis and remains at the position of attention.
      4.3.1.4. Once it is formed, the flight will be squared off prior to sizing. The left flank of
      the formation will be squared off with extra airmen filling in from the fourth to the first
      element. For example, if there is one extra airman, he or she will be positioned in the
      fourth element; if there are two extra airmen, one will be positioned in the third element
      and one will be positioned in the fourth element; and so forth. The flight sergeant will
      occupy the last position in the fourth element.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  33


   4.3.2. To size the flight, the flight commander faces the flight to the right (from line to
   column formation) and has taller personnel (except the guide, element leaders, and flight
   sergeant) move to the front of the flight according to height. The flight commander then
   faces the flight to the right (from column to inverted line formation) and again has taller
   personnel (except the flight sergeant) move to the front of the flight according to height. The
   flight commander faces the flight back to the left (column formation) and continues this
   procedure until all members are properly sized.
   4.3.3. Each member of the flight has a number except the guide. Numbering of individual
   members of a flight is from right to left (when in line formation) and from front to rear (when
   in column formation). The element leader is always number one (Figure 4.3).
   4.3.4. To form at close interval, the command is At Close Interval, FALL IN. On the
   command FALL IN, the movement is executed as prescribed in paragraph 4.3.3 above
   except close interval is observed (Figure 4.4). The only commands that may be given while
   the flight is in this formation are At Close Interval, Dress Right, DRESS; Ready, FRONT;
   AT EASE; ATTENTION; FALL OUT; and DISMISSED.

Figure 4.2. Normal Interval.

   4.3.5. The flight is usually formed and dismissed by the drill instructor or flight sergeant.
   On the command DISMISSED, airmen break ranks and leave the area.
4.4. Aligning the Flight.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 35


  4.4.1. Dress Right (Left) Dress (Line/Inverted Line Formation):
     4.4.1.1. Normal Interval. The commands are Dress Right, DRESS and Ready,
     FRONT. On the command DRESS, everyone except the last airman in each element
     raises and extends the left arm laterally from the shoulder with snap so the arm is parallel
     with the ground. As the arm is raised, un-cup the hand at approximately waist level,
     keeping the palm down. Extend and join the fingers and place the thumb along the
     forefinger. At the same time as the left arm is raised, each individual (except the guide
     and second, third, and fourth element leaders) turns head and eyes 45 degrees to the right
     with snap. The leading individual of each file establishes normal interval (by taking
     small choppy steps and aligning with the base file) and establishes exact shoulder-to-
     fingertip contact with the individual to the immediate right. The second, third, and fourth
     element leaders align themselves directly behind the person in front of them (using small
     choppy steps) and visually establish a 40-inch distance. As the remaining members align
     themselves behind the individual in front of or to the right of them, their shoulders may
     or may not touch the fingertips of the individual to their right. If the arm is too long,
     place the extended hand behind the shoulder of the individual to the left. If the arm is too
     short, leave it extended toward the individual to the left and parallel to the ground. Once
     dress, cover, interval, and distance have been established, the command Ready, FRONT
     will be given. On this command, airmen whose arms are up will lower their arms with
     snap to their sides (without slapping their sides) and re-cup their hands when their arm is
     at approximately waist level. As the arm is lowered, airmen whose heads are turned will
     return their heads to the front with snap. The body is now back to the position of
     attention.
     4.4.1.2. Close Interval. The command is At Close Interval, Dress Right, DRESS. On
     this command, all airmen except the last one in each element will raise their left hand so
     the heel of the hand rests on the left hip, fingers are extended and joined, thumb is along
     the forefinger, fingertips point toward the ground, and the elbow in line with the body
     (figure 4.4). At the same time the left hand is raised, all airmen except the guide and
     second, third, and fourth element leaders will turn their head and eyes 45 degrees to the
     right. First element airmen establish the interval by ensuring their upper right arm
     touches the extended elbow of the individual to their right. The same procedures used to
     establish dress, cover, interval, and distance for normal interval will be used for close
     interval. At Close Interval, Dress Right (Left), DRESS is not given to a flight at
     normal interval, and Dress Right (Left), DRESS is not given to a flight at close interval.
     4.4.1.3. Dress Left Dress. When giving the command Dress Left, DRESS or At Close
     Interval, Dress Left, DRESS, use the procedures for dress right dress except the flight
     must be in inverted line formation, the right arm/hand raised, and the head turned left.
     4.4.1.4. Alignment Procedures. Moving by the most direct route, the flight commander
     takes the position on the flank of the flight toward which the dress is made, one pace
     from and in prolongation of the front rank, performs an in-place halt and faces right (left)
     down the line. From this position, the flight commander verifies the alignment of the
     front rank. If necessary, individuals are called to move forward or backward by name or
     number. Military bearing is maintained and, instead of weaving from side to side, short
     sidesteps are taken to verify alignment. The flight commander then faces to the left
     (right) in marching, halts on the propagation of each succeeding rank, executes right (left)
 36                                                   AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


      face, and aligns the rank. After verifying the alignment of the ranks, the flight
      commander faces to the right (left) in marching, moves three paces beyond the front rank,
      faces to the left (right), and commands Ready, FRONT. Executing a minimum of
      movements, the flight commander takes the normal position by the most direct route in
      front of the flight.
   4.4.2. Cover.
      4.4.2.1. Column Formation. To align the flight in column, the command is COVER.
      On this command, everyone except the guide adjusts by taking small choppy steps if
      needed and establishes dress, cover, interval, and distance. The leading individual of
      each file (excluding the base file) obtains the proper interval (normal or close). The base
      file establishes and maintains a 40-inch distance. All others align themselves beside the
      individual to their right and behind the individual in front of them.
      4.4.2.2. Inverted Column Formation. The same command and procedures used to
      reestablish dress, cover, interval, and distance while in column formation are used in
      inverted column. The exception to this is that the leading individual of the base element
      does not move and everyone else establishes dress, cover, interval, and distance based on
      this individual.
4.5. Open Ranks.
   4.5.1. The command is Open Ranks, MARCH. It is only given to a formation when in line
   at normal interval. On the command MARCH, the fourth rank stands fast and automatically
   executes dress right dress at normal interval. Each succeeding rank in front of the fourth
   rank takes the required numbered of paces, stepping off with the left foot and a coordinated
   arm swing, halts, and automatically executes dress right dress. The third rank takes one pace
   forward, the second rank takes two paces forward, and the first rank takes three paces
   forward. Once halted, the distance between ranks will be 64 inches.
   4.5.2. The flight commander proceeds and aligns the flight. Once the flight is aligned, the
   flight commander commands Ready, FRONT. If the flight is to be inspected, the flight
   commander takes one step forward and faces to the right in a position in front of the guide.
   4.5.3. The flight commander salutes and reports to the inspector Sir (Ma’am), Flight
   _______ is prepared for inspection. As soon as the flight commander has been inspected,
   he or she is asked to accompany the inspector. The flight commander then executes a left
   face (down line) and commands Second, Third, and Fourth Elements, Parade, REST.
   The flight commander executes a half left in marching without arm swing and halts one pace
   to the right and one pace to the rear of the inspector (This causes the flight commander to
   precede the inspector). This position is maintained throughout the inspection of the front of
   each respective rank. When moving from individual to individual during the inspection, the
   inspector and flight commander simultaneously execute a face to the right in marching and
   an in place halt.
      4.5.3.1. The movement is executed by pivoting 90 degrees to the right on the ball of the
      right foot, simultaneously stepping over the right foot with the left foot and placing the
      left foot parallel to the rank being inspected. Then advance one short step with the right
      foot, and place the right foot pointed toward the flight. Next bring the left heel into the
      right heel, and once again reassume the position of attention. The upper portion of the
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   37


     body remains at the position of attention, and the arm swing is suspended throughout
     when inspecting the front of each rank.
     4.5.3.2. These movements should place the inspector directly in front of the next
     individual to be inspected, still preceded by the flight commander. After the inspector
     has inspected the last individual in the front rank, the flight commander hesitates
     momentarily and allows the inspector to precede him or her as the inspector inspects the
     front rank from the rear. Normally, during the inspection of the rear of each rank, the
     flight commander follows the inspector approximately two paces to the rear, halting
     when the inspector halts. After inspecting the rear of each rank, the flight commander
     halts in front of the second person of each rank and faces to the right at the same time as
     the inspector halts in front of the first person. (These procedures are used to inspect the
     front and rear of subsequent ranks.)
  4.5.4. After inspecting the entire flight, the inspector marches off to the right flank (element
  leaders) of the flight. The flight commander proceeds directly to a position three paces
  beyond the front rank, halts, faces to the left (down line), and commands Flight,
  ATTENTION. The flight commander then takes one step forward with arm swing and faces
  to the right. The inspector marches to a position directly in front of the flight commander
  and gives comments. After receiving comments, the flight commander salutes the inspector
  upon departure. The inspector executes the appropriate facing movement to depart. Before
  giving further commands, the flight commander faces left (down line) and commands Close
  Ranks, MARCH, gives parade rest, at ease, or rest (whichever is appropriate), and posts in
  front of and centered on the flight.
  4.5.5. If inspection results are recorded, the following procedures apply. While the flight
  commander is inspected, the recorder; that is, first sergeant or flight sergeant, takes one step
  to the rear, faces to the right, and marches to a position one pace to the right and one pace to
  the front of the guide. He or she then faces down line and prepares to record the inspection
  results. The recorder follows the inspector, who is always moving forward, in the front and
  rear of each rank. (The flight commander follows the recorder during the inspection of the
  rear of each rank.) Once the inspector inspects from the rear the last individual in each rank,
  normally the guide or element leader, the inspector turns and halts directly in front of the
  element leader of the next rank. The recorder marches past the inspector and reassumes the
  position of following the inspector. After the last element has been inspected, the inspector
  inspects the recorder and commands POST. The recorder posts. The flight commander
  marches three paces beyond the front rank, halts, faces to the left (down line), commands
  Flight, ATTENTION, takes one step forward with arm swing, faces to the right, receives
  comments from the inspector, and salutes upon departure. Before giving further commands,
  the flight commander faces left and commands Close Ranks, MARCH. He or she then
  gives parade rest, at ease, or rest; whichever is appropriate, and posts in front of and centered
  on the flight.
  4.5.6. When the inspection party finishes inspecting the first element and before the
  inspector halts in front of the first person of the second element, the second element leader
  assumes the position of attention. The element leader turns his or her head approximately 45
  degrees down line and commands Second Element, ATTENTION. When the first element
  leader can see the inspector out of the corner of his or her eye, the element leader turns his or
 38                                                    AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   her head down line and commands First Element, Parade, REST. This procedure is
   repeated throughout the remaining elements.
4.6. Close Ranks. To close ranks when at open ranks, the command is Close Ranks, MARCH.
On the command MARCH, the first rank stands fast. The second rank takes one pace forward
with coordinated arm swing and halts at the position of attention. The third and fourth ranks take
two and three paces forward, respectively, and halt at attention.
4.7. Individuals to Leave Ranks.
   4.7.1. In line formation, when calling individuals out of ranks, the command is (Rank and
   Last Name), (pause) FRONT AND CENTER. Upon hearing his or her name, the
   individual assumes the position of attention. On the command FRONT AND CENTER, the
   individual takes one step backward (with coordinated arm swing), faces to the left or right,
   proceeds to the closest flank, and then proceeds to the front of the formation by the most
   direct route. Next, he or she halts one pace in front of and facing the person in command,
   salutes, and reports as directed.
   4.7.2. To direct the individuals return, the command is RETURN TO RANKS. The
   individual salutes, faces about, and returns by the same route to the same position in the
   ranks.
4.8. Count Off. For drill purposes, count off is executed only from right to left in line and from
front to rear in column or mass. Flight commanders and guides do not count off in line, column,
or mass.
   4.8.1. In Line. The command is Count, OFF. On the command OFF, all airmen, except
   the guide and element leaders, turn their head and eyes 45 degrees to the right, and the
   element leaders call out ONE in a normal tone of voice. After the element leaders call out
   ONE, airmen in the next file turn their heads and eyes in unison to the front and call out
   TWO. This procedure continues in quick time until all files, full or partial, are numbered.
   All movements are made in a precise manner with snap.
   4.8.2. In Column. The command is Count, OFF. On the command OFF, the element
   leaders turn their heads 45 degrees to the right and in unison call out ONE over their right
   shoulder in a normal tone of voice. Once the number is sounded, the element leaders turn
   their heads back to the front as shown in Figure 4.5 Once the heads of the individuals of the
   previous rank are turned back to the front, individuals in the next rank turn their heads 45
   degrees to the right and call out the subsequent number. This procedure continues in quick
   time until all ranks (full or partial) have been numbered. Except when calling out their
   number, individuals remain at the position of attention.

Section 4B—Marching

4.9. Flight Formation While Marching.
   4.9.1. The normal formation for marching is a column of at least two, but not more than
   four, elements abreast. The element leaders march at the head of their elements.
   4.9.2. The flight marches in line only for minor changes of position.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  39


   4.9.3. When commands are given involving movements in which all elements in the flight
   do not execute the same movement simultaneously, the element leaders give supplementary
   commands for the movement of their elements.
4.10. Close or Extend March. To obtain close interval between files when in column at normal
interval at a halt or while marching at quick time, the command is Close, MARCH. To obtain
normal interval from close interval, the command is Extend, MARCH.
   4.10.1. Close March (Halted). On the command MARCH, the fourth element stands fast.
   The remaining elements take the required number of right steps, all at the same time, and halt
   together. The third element takes two steps, the second element takes four steps, and the first
   element takes six steps.
   4.10.2. Close March (Marching). On the command MARCH, which is given on the right
   foot, the fourth element takes up the half step (beginning with the left foot) following the
   command of execution. The third element obtains close interval by pivoting 45 degrees to
   the right on the ball of the left foot, taking one 24-inch step (with coordinated arm swing)
   toward the fourth element, and then pivoting 45 degrees back to the left on the ball of the
   right foot. The second element takes three steps between pivots, and the first element takes
   five steps between pivots. The original direction of march is resumed; the half step is taken
   up once close interval is obtained; and dress, cover, interval, and distance are reestablished.
   On the command Forward, MARCH, all elements resume a 24-inch step.
   4.10.3. Extend March (Halted). Reverse the procedures used to obtain close interval to
   obtain normal interval.
 40                                                   AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


Figure 4.5. Count Off in Column.




   4.10.4. Extend March (Marching). The same procedures and steps used to obtain close
   interval are used except the command is given on the left foot and the pivots are made on the
   right foot.
4.11. Column Movements.
   4.11.1. Column Right (Left) Normal Interval (Marching). The commands are Column
   Right (Left), MARCH and Forward, MARCH (Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7).
      4.11.1.1. On the command Column Right (Left), MARCH, the fourth (first) element
      leader takes one more 24-inch step, pivots 90 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                     41


     left (right) foot, and suspends arm swing during the pivot. Following the pivot, step off
     in a 24-inch step and resume coordinated arm swing. Beginning with the second step
     after the pivot, take up the half step. Each succeeding member of the fourth (first)
     element marches to the approximate pivot point established by the person in front of him
     or her and performs the same procedures as the element leader.
     4.11.1.2. The third (second) element leader takes one 24-inch step, (maintaining
     coordinated arm swing throughout) pivots 45 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the
     left (right) foot, and takes two 24-inch steps prior to pivoting 45 degrees to the right (left)
     on the ball of the left (right) foot. Continue marching in 24-inch steps until even with the
     person who marches on the right (left). Then begin half stepping and establish interval
     and dress. Each succeeding member of the third (second) element marches to the
     approximate pivot point established by the person in front of him or her and performs the
     same procedures as the element leader.
     4.11.1.3. The second (third) element leader takes one more 24-inch step, (maintaining
     coordinated arm swing throughout) pivots 45 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the
     left (right) foot, and takes four 24-inch steps prior to pivoting 45 degrees to the right (left)
     on the ball of the left (right) foot. Continue marching in 24-inch steps until even with the
     person who marches on the right (left). Then begin half stepping, and establish interval
     and dress. Each succeeding member of the second (third) element marches to the
     approximate pivot point established by the person in front of him or her and performs the
     same procedures as the element leader.
     4.11.1.4. The first (fourth) element leader takes one more 24-inch step, (maintaining
     coordinated arm swing throughout) pivots 45 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the
     left (right) foot, and takes six 24-inch steps prior to pivoting 45 degrees to the right (left)
     on the ball of the left (right) foot. Continue marching in 24-inch steps until even with the
     person who marches on the right (left). Then begin half stepping, and establish interval
     and dress. Each succeeding member of the first (fourth) element marches to the
     approximate point established by the person in front of him or her and performs the same
     procedures as the element leader.
     4.11.1.5. The guide performs the pivots and steps exactly as the fourth element leader.
     Following completion of the pivots, the guide continues in a 24-inch step until he or she
     is ahead of the fourth element leader. The guide pivots 45 degrees to a position in front
     of the fourth element leader; then he or she pivots 45 degrees again toward the front and
     begins half stepping.

Figure 4.7. Column Right March at Close Interval.




      4.11.1.6. Once the entire formation has changed direction and dress, cover, interval, and
      distance are reestablished, Forward, MARCH will be given. On the command
      MARCH, take one more 12-inch step with the right foot, and then step off with a full 24-
      inch step with the left foot. When performing column left, the responsibility of dress
      reverts to the left flank on the preparatory command Column left. The responsibility
      remains with the left flank until the command MARCH is given; then it reverts to the
      right flank.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                      43


   4.11.2. Column Right (Left) Close Interval. These movements are performed in the same
   manner as at normal interval except the element closest to the base file takes two 12-inch
   steps between pivots, the next element takes four 12-inch steps between pivots, and the last
   element takes six 12-inch steps between pivots.
   4.11.3. Column Movements from a Halt (Normal or Close Interval). When column
   movements are executed from a halt, procedures are similar to those in paragraph 4.11.1
   and paragraph 4.11.2 On the command MARCH, element leaders begin the movement by
   executing a face in marching for a column left. For a column right, element leaders take one
   24-inch step forward, then execute the movement.
4.12. Column Half Right (Left).
   4.12.1. To change the direction of a column by 45 degrees, the command is Column Half
   Right (Left), MARCH. On the command MARCH, the leading airman of the right (left)
   flank advances one full 24-inch step, pivots 45 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the left
   (right) foot, and advances another full 24-inch step, maintaining coordinated arm swing. The
   airman then takes up the half step and continues in a half step until each member in his or her
   rank is abreast of each other. Then all members of that rank resume a full 24-inch step. In
   the meantime, the remaining individuals of the leading rank pivot 45 degrees to the right
   (left), with coordinated arm swing and without changing the interval, and continue marching
   in full 24-inch steps until they are abreast of the base file. At this point, they conform to the
   step of the individual in the right (left) flank and establish the proper interval. The remaining
   airmen in each file march to the approximate pivot point established by the element leader
   and perform the movement in the same manner. They then dress to their right and cover
   directly behind the person in front of them.
   4.12.2. The flight commander and guide pivot 45 degrees in the direction of the movement.
   Then they pivot 45 degrees back to their original positions in front of the column.
   4.12.3. When column half left is executed from a halt, the procedures are the same as
   described in paragraph 4.12.1 and paragraph 4.12.2 above except, on the command of
   execution, the element leaders begin the movement by executing a face in marching to the
   indicated direction.
   4.12.4. To execute a slight change of direction, the command INCLINE TO THE RIGHT
   (LEFT) is given. The guide or guiding element moves in the indicated direction, and the rest
   of the element follows. There is no pivot in this movement.
4.13. Forming a Single File or Multiple Files. These are not precise movements, but they are
practiced in drill so, when necessary, the movements can be executed smoothly and without
delay. These movements are executed only from the halt.
   4.13.1. Column of Files. To form a single file when in a column of two or more elements,
   the command is Column of Files From the Right (Left), Forward, MARCH. If the
   movement is from the left, the guide takes a position in front of the file that will move first
   upon hearing the informational command, and remains at carry guidon. On the preparatory
   command, the element leader of the right (left) element turns his or her head 45 degrees to
   the right (left) and commands Forward. At the same time, the remaining element leaders turn
   their heads 45 degrees to the right (left) and command STAND FAST. Their heads are kept
   to the right (left) until they step off. On the command MARCH, the extreme right (left)
 44                                                    AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   element steps off. The element leader of each remaining element commands Forward,
   MARCH as the last airman in each element passes, ensuring the leaders element is in step
   with the preceding element. All elements then incline to the right (left), following the
   leading elements in successive order (Figure 4.8).

Figure 4.8. Forming a File From a Column of Twos.




   4.13.2. Column of Files, Column Half Right (Left). In conjunction with forming single files,
   column movements may be executed at the same time. The command is Column of Files
   From the Right (Left), Column Right (Left). On the informational command, the guide
   executing a face in marching takes a position in front of the file that will move first. On the
   preparatory command, the element leader of the right (left) element commands Column
   Right (Left). The remaining element leaders command STAND FAST. On the command
   MARCH, the element leader and guide execute a face in marching to the right (left), and the
   element leader continues marching in the new direction with 24-inch steps. The guide
   marches to a position ahead of the element leader, then pivots 45 degrees to a position 40
   inches in front of the element leader. The remaining individuals in the base file march
   forward on the command of execution, pivot in approximately the same location as their
   element leader, and maintain a 40-inch distance. The element leaders of the remaining
   elements command Column Right (Left), MARCH, at which time all Airmen perform the
   movement in the same manner as the base element. The element leaders follow the leading
   elements in successive order. All members of the formation continue taking 12” steps until
   receiving the command Forward MARCH.
   4.13.3. Column of Twos (Fours) From a Single File (Multiple Elements). To form a
   column of two or more files when in a single file of more than one element, the command is
   Column of Twos (Fours) to the Left (Right). On the informational command, the leading
   element leader turns his or her head 45 degrees to the right (left) and commands STAND
   FAST. At the same time, the remaining element leaders turn their heads 45 degrees to the
   right (left) and command Column Half Left (Right). On the command MARCH, the
   leading element stands fast, and the element leader returns his or her head back to the front.
   The remaining element leaders turn their heads back to the front and step off, executing a
   column half left (right) simultaneously, and incline and form to the left (right) of the leading
   element. The remaining members of each element march to the approximate pivot point
   established by the element leaders and perform the movement in the same manner as the
   element leaders. Each element is halted by its element leader turning his or her head 45
   degrees to the left (right) and commanding the element to halt so his or her element is abreast
   of, and even with, the leading element (figure 4.9).
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   45


Figure 4.9. Forming a Column of Twos From a File.




4.14. Forming a Column of Twos From a Single File. When at a halt and in column, the
command is Column of Twos to the Left (Right), MARCH. On the command MARCH, the
leader stands fast. The airman who is the center of the element (when in line) performs a half left
(right) in marching, takes one 24-inch step, performs a half right (left) in marching, and moves
up until abreast of, and at normal interval from, the leading individual of the original element.
To halt, the leading individual of the new element turns his or her head 45 degrees to the left
(right) and commands the element to halt. All airmen execute the pivot in approximately the
same location, and all individuals who are required to move do so at the same time (figure 4.9).
4.15. Forming a Column of Twos From a Column of Fours and Reforming.
   4.15.1. This is not a precise movement, but it is practiced in drill so, when necessary, the
   movement can be executed smoothly and without delay. These movements are executed only
   from a halt.
   4.15.2. To form a column of twos when in a column of fours at a halt, the command is
   Column of Twos From the Right (Left), Forward. On the preparatory command, the
   fourth (second) element leader turns his or her head 45 degrees to the right (left) and
   commands Forward; the second (fourth) element leader turns his or her head 45 degrees
   right (left) and commands STAND FAST. Each keeps his or her head to the right (left) until
   his or her element steps off. On the command MARCH, the designated elements step off
   immediately. As the last airmen in the designated lead elements pass and on the command
   Forward, MARCH (given by the second (fourth) element leader), the two remaining
   elements step off in step and incline in behind the two leading elements. The distance
   between elements is three paces (figure 4.10). When performing this movement from the
   left, the guide will immediately post in front of the second element on the informational
   command.
   4.15.3. To form a column of fours when in a column of twos at a halt, the command is
   Column of Fours to the Left (Right). On the informational command, the fourth (second)
   element leader turns his or her head 45 degrees to the left (right) and commands STAND
   FAST; the second (fourth) element leader turns his or her head 45 degrees to the left (right)
   and commands Column Half Left (Right). On the command MARCH, the element leaders
   return their heads to the front, the leading elements stand fast, and the remaining elements
   step off and execute a column half left (right) and incline to form to the left (right) of the
   leading elements (Figure 4.11). As the trailing elements approach the head of the leading
   elements, the second (fourth) element leader turns his or her head 45 degrees to the left
   (right) and commands Elements, HALT so the leading individual of each element is
   approximately even with all others. Once the elements halt, each element leader returns his
   or her head to the front.

4.16. Counter March. This is not a precise movement, but it is used to permit flexibility in the
movement of units where space is limited. The command is Counter, MARCH.
   4.16.1. Marching.    On the command MARCH (given on the left foot), execute the
   following:
       4.16.1.1. The first element leader takes four 24-inch steps forward and executes a 90-
       degree pivot to the right (suspending arm swing during the pivot), marches across the
       front of the flight just beyond the fourth element, and executes another 90-degree pivot to
       the right (again suspending arm swing). Each succeeding member marches to the
       approximate pivot points established by the person in front of him or her and performs
       the same procedures as the first element leader.
       4.16.1.2. The second element leader takes two 24-inch steps forward and executes a 90-
       degree pivot to the right with suspended arm swing. He or she continues to march and
       executes another 90-degree pivot to the right (with suspended armswing) between the
       third and fourth elements. Each succeeding member marches to the pivot points
       established by the person in front of him or her and performs the same procedures as the
       second element leader.
       4.16.1.3. The third element leader takes one 24-inch step forward, executes two 90-
       degree pivots to the left (with suspended armswing during the pivots), and marches
       between the remainder of the third and second elements. Each succeeding member
       marches to the approximate pivot points established by the person in front of him or her
       and performs the same procedures as the third element leader.
       4.16.1.4. The fourth element leader takes three 24-inch steps forward and executes a 90-
       degree pivot to the left with suspended armswing. The element leader then marches
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                47


     across the front of the flight and executes another 90-degree pivot to the left between the
     first and second elements, suspending armswing during the pivot. Each succeeding
     member marches to the approximate pivot points established by the person in front of
     him or her and performs the same procedures as the fourth element leader.
     4.16.1.5. The guide performs this movement in approximately the same manner as the
     fourth element leader, staying in front of the fourth element leader in the most practical
     manner.
     4.16.1.6. As the fourth element leader marches past the last airman in the fourth element,
     he or she and the individuals of the file begin marching in a half step. The remaining
     element leaders begin the half step once they pass the last individual in each file. After
     the element leaders pass the last individual in each file, they incline, as necessary, to
     obtain close or normal interval; then they begin the half step. Forward MARCH will be
     given once all airmen have completed the movement and proper dress, cover, interval,
     and distance have been established.
  4.16.2. Halted. This movement is performed in the same manner as if marching, but with
  the following exceptions: prior to executing the movement, the first element leader takes five
  paces forward, the third element leader takes three paces forward, the second element leader
  takes two paces forward, and the fourth element leader takes four paces forward.

                                          Chapter 5

                               DRILL OF THE SQUADRON

Section 5A—Rules for Squadron Drill

5.1. The Squadron as a Drill Unit.
   5.1.1. A squadron consists of two or more flights. Only formations necessary for marches,
   drills, and ceremonies are prescribed in this chapter. The squadron forms in line with flights
   in line. When in column formation, the squadron is sized according to height, the tallest
   individuals to the front and right.
   5.1.2. The squadron does not execute marchings in line except for minor changes in position.
   5.1.3. When changes of formation involve changes of post (for example, the first sergeant),
   the new post is taken by the most direct route and as soon as possible after the command of
   execution.
5.2. Commands.
   5.2.1. In squadron drill (except mass formation) when the individuals in the unit are to
   execute a movement together, the flight commanders repeat the preparatory commands of the
   squadron commander for facings, steps, and marchings except when the preparatory
   command of the squadron commander is Squadron. In this case, the flight commanders give
   the preparatory command Flight. When flights of the squadron are to execute a movement in
   successive order, such as a column movement while marching, the commander of Flight A
   repeats the squadron commander’s preparatory command, and the commanders of the other
   flights give a supplementary command, such as CONTINUE THE MARCH. The flight
   commanders of the other flights repeat the squadron commander’s preparatory command and
   command of execution so their flights execute the movement in approximately the same
   location as the first flight.
   5.2.2. If the squadron in column is at the halt when the squadron commander commands
   Column Right, the leading flight commander will supplement the command with
   COLUMN RIGHT. At the same time, the remaining flight commanders command Forward.
   When the squadron commander commands MARCH, the leading flight executes column
   right, and the remaining flights march forward and execute the column movement on the
   command of their appropriate flight commanders. Each flight executes the movement at
   approximately the same location and in the manner as the first flight.
   5.2.3. To open ranks, the squadron commander faces the units and commands PREPARE
   FOR INSPECTION. The flight commanders, in successive order from the squadron
   commanders left to right, command their flights Open Ranks, MARCH. They align their
   flights and give the command Ready, FRONT.
   5.2.4. When the squadron is in column and it is desired to obtain the correct distance
   between flights, such as a column from standard mass formation, the command is CLOSE
   ON LEADING FLIGHT. On this command, the leading flight commander commands the
   flight to take up the half step. As soon as the correct distance has been obtained, each
   succeeding flight takes up the half step at its commander’s command. When all flights have
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   49


   obtained the correct distance, the squadron commander gives Forward, MARCH, and all
   flights step off with a 24-inch step.
   5.2.5. When commands are given in which one flight is to stand fast or continue to march
   while other flights do not, the appropriate flight commander commands STAND FAST or
   CONTINUE THE MARCH.
   5.2.6. In giving commands, flight commanders may include the letter of their flights; for
   example, A Flight, HALT or B Flight, Forward. Flight commanders do not repeat the
   squadron commanders combined commands.

Section 5B—Formations

5.3. Forming the Squadron in Line.
   5.3.1. The squadron is formed in line with flights in line by the first sergeant, who takes an
   initial post nine paces in front of the point where the center of the squadron is to be, faces
   that point, and commands FALL IN. On the command FALL IN, the squadron forms in
   two or more flights with normal interval between individuals (unless close interval is
   directed) and a three-pace interval between flights. Figure 5.1 indicates key positions.

Figure 5.1. Forming the Squadron in Line.




   5.3.2. While positioning units in an area, the command is _____ Paces Forward, MARCH
   or _____ Steps Backward, MARCH. (In backward march, the airman takes 12-inch steps
   backward (starting with the left foot) and maintains normal arm swing). These commands
   are used for short distances only of four paces (steps) or less.
   5.3.3. Each flight sergeant takes a post three paces in front of and centered on the flight. The
   flights then form as prescribed under the supervision of the flight sergeants.
   5.3.4. The flight sergeants then command REPORT. Remaining in position, the element
   leaders in succession from front to rear of each flight salute and report _____ Element, all
   present or _____ Element, (number) person(s) absent. The flight sergeants then face
   about.
 50                                                    AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   5.3.5. Upon receiving the command REPORT given by the first sergeant, the flight
   sergeants, beginning with the right flight, successively salute and report _____ Flight, all
   present or accounted for or _____ Flight, (number) persons absent. After all flights have
   reported, the first sergeant commands POST. The flight sergeants face about and move by
   the most direct route to their positions in the ranks. The squadron commander takes a
   position 12 paces in front of, centered on, and facing the squadron to receive the report of the
   first sergeant. The guidon bearer assumes a position with the commander. The first sergeant
   faces the squadron commander, salutes, and reports Sir (Ma’am), all present or accounted
   for or (number) persons absent. Without a command, the first sergeant faces about and
   moves by the most direct route to the appropriate position.
   5.3.6. Flight commanders immediately take their posts after the first sergeant has reported
   (figure 5.2).
   5.3.7. In forming the squadron, any individual required to make a report salutes while
   reporting and holds the salute until it is returned. The individual receiving the report does
   not return the salute until the report is completed.

Figure 5.2. Squadron in Line.




5.4. Aligning the Squadron.
   5.4.1. To align the squadron formed in line at a halt, the squadron commander orders
   DRESS FLIGHTS TO THE RIGHT. On this command, the flight commanders face about
   and, beginning with the base flight, dress the flight immediately with the command Dress
   Right, DRESS. The flight is dressed as described in flight drill (paragraph 4.3), then given
   Ready, FRONT. Each subsequent flight commander’s flight is dressed to the right as soon
   as the preceding flight commander halts and faces down line of the first element. When not
   adjacent to the base flight, the flight commander’s flight is dressed on the next flight toward
   the base flight.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  51


   5.4.2. To align the squadron when in mass at a halt, the command is At Close Interval,
   Dress Right, DRESS. On the command DRESS, the squadron dresses at close interval.
   The base flight commander promptly verifies the alignment of ranks. When the flight
   commander resumes the post, the squadron commander commands Ready, FRONT and
   COVER.
5.5. Inspecting the Squadron.
   5.5.1. To inspect the squadron, it must be formed in line. The squadron commander
   commands PREPARE FOR INSPECTION. On this command, the flight commanders face
   about and order ranks to be opened (see paragraph 4.5 for opening ranks). After the
   command Ready, FRONT, flight commanders command Parade, REST.
   5.5.2. When all flights are at parade rest, the squadron commander begins by inspecting the
   guidon bearer. The guidon bearer may assume the position of parade rest after being
   inspected.
   5.5.3. The first sergeant joins the squadron commander if so directed and take notes during
   the inspection. As the squadron commander approaches each flight, the flight commander
   brings the flight to attention, salutes, and reports Sir (Ma’am), _____ Flight is prepared for
   inspection. After being inspected, the flight commander accompanies the squadron
   commander through the inspection of the flight. The flight commanders’ position is to the
   right rear of the inspecting officer, walking in the lead in a showing capacity. See Figure 5.3
   for the position of the inspecting officer. Single file between ranks is observed with the
   flight commander in the lead followed by the inspecting officer and, in turn, by the first
   sergeant, as required. The squadron commander, beginning at the head of the column or
   right of the line, makes a minute inspection of the equipment, dress, and appearance of the
   airmen.
 52                                                    AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


Figure 5.3. Inspection of the Squadron.




   5.5.4. The inspection is made from the right to left in front and from left to right in rear of
   each rank.
   5.5.5. The flight commander may give parade rest to elements not being inspected. The
   element leader calls the element to attention before the inspecting officer completes the
   inspection of the preceding element. The element leader may give the element parade rest
   after being inspected.
   5.5.6. On completion of the inspection of each flight, the flight commander moves three
   paces beyond the front rank, halts, faces down the line, and calls the flight to attention. The
   flight commander takes one pace forward, faces to the right, and receives comments from the
   inspecting officer. The flight commander salutes the inspecting officer upon departure and
   then faces down the line and commands Close Ranks, MARCH. He or she then commands
   Parade, REST, AT EASE, or REST, whichever is appropriate, takes a post in front of the
   flight, centers on the flight, and assumes the same position as the flight.
5.6. The Squadron in Column. The squadron moves from one place to another in column of
flights as shown in Figure 5.4 The guidon bearer is one pace to the rear and two paces to the left
of the squadron commander. To view and control the squadron, the squadron commander may
take a position on the flank. When this occurs, the guidon bearer is at the head of the column.
5.7. Massing the Squadron When in Column at Close Interval.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  53


   5.7.1. To form the squadron in mass when it is halted in column, the command is Squadron
   Mass Left, MARCH. On the preparatory command, the leading flight commander gives the
   command STAND FAST. Each flight commander of the succeeding flights commands
   Column Half Left. On the command MARCH, the leading flight stands fast. In turn, each
   rear flight executes a column half left, and the flight commander commands Column Half
   Right to move the flight to the new position at a 4-inch interval alongside the flight it was
   following. Each flight commander halts the flight when its leading rank is on line with the
   leading rank of the flight already on line. This places the squadron in mass with 4-inch
   interval between all individuals in rank (Figure 5.5).
   5.7.2. To form the squadron in mass while marching, the commands by the squadron
   commander are the same as if halted. On the preparatory command, the A Flight commander
   commands CONTINUE THE MARCH, and flight commanders of succeeding flights
   command Column Half Left. On the command MARCH, the commander of the leading
   flight (A Flight) halts the flight, and the other flights move to the new positions in the same
   manner as before.
5.8. Changing Direction When in Mass Formation.
   5.8.1. To change direction when in mass formation and the squadron is at the halt or in
   march, the command is Right (Left) Turn, MARCH. The right (left) flank individual of the
   line of guides and flight commanders is the pivot for this movement. On the command Right
   Turn, MARCH, the individual takes one pace forward, executes a 90-degree pivot to the
   right, advances one 24-inch step, and takes up the half step. On the command Left Turn,
   MARCH, the individual faces to the left in marching, advances one 24-inch step, and takes
   up the half step. Other front rank individuals do a right (left) 45-degree pivot, advance until
   opposite their places in line, do a second right (left) 45-degree pivot, and upon arriving
   abreast of the pivot individual, take up the half step. See Figure 5.6 for the proper number of
   steps between pivots.

   5.8.2. Each succeeding rank executes the movement in approximately the same location and
   in the same manner as the preceding rank. All continue marching in the half step until the
   command Forward, MARCH is given. Forward march will be given once the change of
   direction is completed and dress, cover, interval, and distance have been reestablished.
   5.8.3. When turning to the left, each rank dresses left on the preparatory command. Dress
   will remain left until the command MARCH is given. Then the dress reverts to the right and
   remains there unless otherwise announced.

   5.8.4. The squadron commander faces the squadron and marches backward until the change
   in direction has been completed.
5.9. Column of Flights From Squadron Mass Formation.
   5.9.1. From a halt, the command is Column of Flights, Right Flight, Forward, MARCH.
   On the preparatory command, the right flight commander commands Forward, and the other
   flight commanders command STAND FAST. On the command MARCH, the right flight
   marches forward. Each of the remaining flights follows in column in its normal formation,
   executing column half right and column half left upon the commands of its commander.
   5.9.2. While marching, the squadron commander gives the same commands as in the
   previous movement except double time is given instead of forward, and commanders of
   flights other than the right flight command CONTINUE THE MARCH. On the command
   MARCH, the right flight marches out in double time. At the appropriate time, other flight
   commanders give Double Time, MARCH and INCLINE TO THE RIGHT (LEFT) to
   bring their flights into the column and align them behind the preceding flight.
5.10. Extended Mass Formation With Flights in Column.
   5.10.1. The extended mass formation is used when a more impressive appearance for drill
   and ceremonies is desired (Figure 5.7).
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    57


Figure 5.7. Squadron in Extended Mass Formation.




   5.10.2. The commands are Squadron Mass, (number) Paces Left, MARCH. On the
   command MARCH, the movement is executed as described in paragraph 5.9.2 except the
   rear flights execute a column half left and a column half right to move to the new position
   beside the leading flight at the interval ordered. Each flight is halted when its leading rank is
   on line with the leading rank of the flight already on line.
   5.10.3. In extended mass formation, the squadron drills in the same manner as for mass
   formation, maintaining the interval between flights.

5.11. Dismissing the Squadron. The squadron is in line at attention. The squadron commander
directs the first sergeant to dismiss the squadron. The command is First Sergeant, (pause)
DISMISS THE SQUADRON. On this command, the first sergeant takes the most direct route
to a position three paces from the squadron commander, who is nine paces in front of and
centered on the squadron. The first sergeant halts and salutes. The squadron commander returns
the salute and commands DISMISS THE SQUADRON. The first sergeant salutes and the
squadron commander returns the salute and falls out. At the same time, flight commanders and
the guidon bearer fall out. The first sergeant executes an about face, and the flight sergeants take
their posts three paces in front of and centered on their flights. The first sergeant then orders the
flight sergeants to dismiss their flights by giving the command DISMISS YOUR FLIGHTS.
The first sergeant then falls out. The flight sergeants face about and command DISMISSED.
Individuals break ranks and leave the formation.

Section 5C—Manual of the Guidon

5.12. The Guidon. The guidon is carried at ceremonies and on other occasions when prescribed
by the commander. The guidon bearer is a specially selected airman designated by the squadron
commander.
5.13. Order Guidon. Order guidon is the position of attention as shown in Figure 5.8 The
guidon bearer holds the guidon in a vertical position and keeps the ferrule on the ground beside
the right shoe. The guidon bearer holds the staff in the right hand in the “V” formed by the
thumb and by the fingers extended and joined. The right hand and arm are kept behind the staff
with the arm bent naturally and the staff resting against the hollow of the shoulder.
5.14. Carry Guidon. Carry guidon is the position in which the ferrule is approximately 6
inches from the ground (Figure 5.9).
   5.14.1. Facings, alignments, and formal marchings require carry guidon. The guidon bearer
   keeps the staff in a vertical position throughout the movements and brings it to carry guidon
   on the preparatory command for the movement.
   5.14.2. When marching at route step or at ease, the guidon bearer may hold the guidon in
   either hand at the carry position.
   5.14.3. Parade rest is executed by sliding the hand up the staff and inclining the staff of the
   guidon forward at arm’s length with the hand at waist level (Figure 5.10).
   5.14.4. At double time, the guidon bearer holds the guidon diagonally across the body
   (Figure 5.11). The guidon bearer grasps the staff with the right hand at the position used at
   the carry, with the right forearm horizontal and the elbow near the body. The staff is grasped
   with the left hand opposite the left shoulder.
   5.14.5. When executing column movements and turns, the guidon bearer executes the
   movement on the command of execution and then moves at 45-degree angles to a position in
   front of the base file.
   5.14.6. When the squadron is in column with the squadron commander on the flank, the
   guidon bearers position is five paces in front of and centered on the front rank of the leading
   flight.

5.15. Executing Order Guidon While at Carry Guidon. The guidon bearer lets the staff slide
through the right hand until the ferrule is on the ground in line with and touching the toe of the
right shoe. The staff is re-grasped with the hand as at the carry position.
5.16. Executing Carry Guidon While at Order Guidon. The guidon bearer grasps the staff
with the left hand while at the same time loosening the grip of the right hand on the staff. The
guidon is raised vertically with the left hand, letting the staff slide upward through the right hand
until the ferrule is approximately 6 inches from the ground. The guidon bearer then re-grasps the
staff with the right hand and cuts the left hand away smartly to the left side.
5.17. Executing Present Guidon When at Carry or Order Guidon. To execute present
guidon when at carry, or order guidon while marching or at a halt, on the preparatory command
Present or Eyes, the guidon bearer raises the guidon vertically until the right arm is fully
extended. At the same time, the left hand is brought smartly across the chest to guide the staff as
shown in figure 5.12. On the command of execution ARMS or RIGHT, the guidon bearer
lowers the guidon straight to the front with the right arm extended and the staff resting in the pit
of the arm, cutting the left hand away smartly to the left side. On the command RIGHT of Eyes,
RIGHT, the guidon bearer turns the head and eyes in the same manner prescribed for other
individuals in the formation. On the preparatory command Ready, the guidon bearer raises the
guidon vertically until the right arm is fully extended. At the same time, the left hand is brought
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                      63


smartly across the chest to guide the staff as shown in Figure 5.12 On the command of
execution FRONT, the guidon is returned to the position of carry, and the head and eyes are
turned to the front.
5.18. Executing Carry Guidon When at Present Guidon. On the preparatory command, the
guidon bearer raises the staff to the vertical position and, at the same time, brings the left arm
smartly across the chest to let the left hand guide the staff. On the command of execution, the
guidon bearer loosens the grip of the left hand on the staff and lowers the guidon with the right
hand. The left hand is used to steady the staff until the ferrule is approximately 6 inches from the
ground, then the left hand is cut away smartly to the left side.
5.19. Executing Order Guidon When at Present Guidon. The guidon bearer executes order
guidon as prescribed in paragraph 5.18 except, after bringing the guidon to the carry position, the
staff is permitted to slide through the right hand. The staff is steadied with the left hand until the
guidon is in the position of order guidon, and the left hand is then cut smartly away to the left
side.
5.20. Individual Salute by Guidon Bearer When not in Formation. When at order guidon,
the guidon bearer executes the salute with the left hand in a two-count movement. On the first
count, the left arm is moved horizontally across the body with forearm and wrist straight and
fingers and thumb extended and joined with palm down. The first joint of the forefinger touches
the staff (Figure 5.13). On the second count, the left hand is cut smartly away to the side. The
salute at carry guidon is executed in the same manner except the ferrule is approximately 6
inches from the ground as shown in Figure 5.14

                                           Chapter 6

                           GROUP AND WING FORMATIONS

Section 6A—Function of the Group and Wing

6.1. Composition of the Group and Wing.
   6.1.1. The group is composed of two or more squadrons; the wing is composed of two or
   more groups. Formation and movements of the group and wing are for ceremonies. This
   chapter describes the formations preceding inspections, reviews, and parades.
   6.1.2. The group commander directs the assembly of units in mass formation.              Each
   squadron commander moves the squadron to its place in the most convenient manner.
   6.1.3. When in mass formation, the group drills by command. Such drill is limited to
   movements for ceremonies where the units of the group execute the facings and marchings as
   one body on command of the group commander. The group executes these movements in a
   manner similar to that prescribed for the squadron.
   6.1.4. The wing does not drill by command. Its groups form and march as directed by the
   wing commander. When practical, the formation and movement of the subdivisions of the
   group and wing are made clear to the unit commanders before starting the movement.
   6.1.5. To assume any formation, the group or wing commander announces the desired
   formation, point for the right (left) of the group or wing, and direction in which the line or
   column is to face. The units approach the line on which the group or wing forms in column
   or line. After completion of a movement, the squadrons are given at ease until another
   movement is ordered.
   6.1.6. After a group is halted and if it is under the immediate command of the group
   commander, the squadron commanders do not give supplementary commands to correct the
   alignment or position of their squadrons unless ordered by the group commander.
   6.1.7. Once ceremonies begin, units remain at attention until ordered to a rest position by the
   next higher commander.
   6.1.8. A unit may be presented to its commander or a reviewing officer. When this is done,
   the presenting officer faces the unit and gives the command Present, ARMS. When all
   elements of the unit are at present arms, the presenting officer faces to the front and
   commands the members of the staff to present arms. The flag/guidon bearer salutes on
   command of the staff.
6.2. Composition of the Staff.
   6.2.1. The squadron is the smallest formation with a staff. The commissioned staff of a
   commander forms in one rank, 1 1/2 paces to the rear. The individuals of the staff form 1 1/2
   paces to the rear of the officers, but do not normally participate in the marching staff. When
   only one staff officer is present, a position is taken one pace to the right and 1 1/2 paces to
   the rear of the commander. Staff members usually are arranged from right to left in order of
   rank, the senior on the right. However, the commander arranges them in any desired order.
   Airmen forming with the staff are usually posted in order of rank from right to left, except
 68                                                   AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   the bearer of a general officer’s individual flag is on the right.       The arrangement is
   diagrammed in Figure 6.1

Figure 6.1. Arrangement of Reviewing Officers Staff (General Officer).




   6.2.2. If necessary to reduce the front of the staff, as in marching, the staff is formed in a
   column of threes and follows the commander. It marches under the direction of the senior
   staff officer.

Section 6B—Group Formations

6.3. Formation of the Group.
   6.3.1. For ceremonies, the group is formed with squadrons in mass. When an increase in
   size for appearance is necessary, the group is formed in line with squadrons in line. When
   formations are in movement, the group is usually in column with squadrons in column and
   flights in column, as shown in Figure 6.2 The group in mass formation is used for special
   command reviews.
   6.3.2. The attached elements take their positions as directed by the group commander. They
   conform to the formation and movements of the other elements of the group.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 69

   6.3.3. Regardless of the direction the group faces, squadrons are designated alphabetically
   from right to left in line and from front to rear in column; that is, A Squadron, B Squadron, C
   Squadron, etc. Groups are also lettered from right to left when in line and from front to rear
   when in column. The terms “right” and “left” apply to right and left as the troops face.
   6.3.4. The designation “center squadron” indicates the center or the right center squadron,
   depending on whether the number of squadrons is even or odd.
   6.3.5. The group commander supervises the formation from those positions that are best for
   correcting alignments, intervals, and distances. With the staff (except the adjutant), the
   group commander takes the post in time to receive the report.
   6.3.6. Special requirements of space or purpose may necessitate variations in formations. If
   they do, adhere as closely as possible to principles of spacing, precedence, and protocol.
6.4. Forming the Group in Column.
   6.4.1. The group forms in column from a line of squadrons in line by executing right face.
   Usually the group commander prescribes the following:
      6.4.1.1. Formation.
      6.4.1.2. Direction the column will face.
      6.4.1.3. Hour of forming.
      6.4.1.4. Location of the head of the column.
      6.4.1.5. Order in column of the group headquarters, squadrons, and attached elements.
   6.4.2. At the appointed time, the squadron commanders form their units. They place their
   units in column and report their arrival in place to the group commander or adjutant.
6.5. Forming the Group in Line With Squadrons in Line.
   6.5.1. Before the ceremonies, the adjutant ensures the group position on the parade ground is
   marked with two flags. The flags are placed on each flank of the line on which the group is
   to form. Additional markers may be placed on the line to indicate the position of guides.
   6.5.2. When a band is to participate in the ceremonies, the adjutant prearranges a signal or a
   specific time for Adjutant’s Call to be sounded. The adjutant takes the initial post for the
   ceremony on the right of the line facing down the line.
   6.5.3. Squadrons are marched onto the parade ground from the troops left flank facing the
   reviewing stand and brought onto the ready line in column.
   6.5.4. As each squadron arrives in its position on the ready line, it is halted and faced to the
   left. The squadron commander then commands GUIDE ON LINE. On this command, the
   guide of each flight double times to a position on the final line indicated by flags, halts, and
   faces the adjutant. The adjutant aligns the guides on the right squadron. The guides of the
   other squadrons advance in the same manner and align themselves on the guides who have
   already posted. As soon as the guides have established themselves on the line, the squadron
   commanders command Forward, MARCH. The command of execution for their movement
   is timed so they will step off at the first note of the music following Adjutant’s Call. The
   squadron is halted so the right shoulder of the right individual of the front rank in each flight
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                71


   touches the back of the guide. The squadron commander orders the squadron to dress, and
   flight commanders check alignment (Figure 6.3).

Figure 6.3. Group in Line With Squadrons in Line.




   6.5.5. When the elements reach their position on the line, the band stops playing. The
   adjutant then moves with dignity at adjutant’s cadence by the most direct route to a position
   midway between the line of squadron commanders and the group commander. The adjutant
   halts facing down line of troops, and then executes left face.
   6.5.6. When all elements are dressed, the adjutant commands Guides, POST. On this
   command, the guides take one pace forward with coordinated armswing, halt, and execute a
   left face.
   6.5.7. The adjutant then commands Present, ARMS, faces the group commander, salutes,
   and reports Sir (Ma’am), the group is formed.
   6.5.8. The group commander returns the salute and orders TAKE YOUR POST. The
   adjutant passes to the group commander’s right and takes the post on line with the staff. The
   group commander commands Order, ARMS.
6.6. Forming the Group in Line With Squadrons in Mass Formation.
   6.6.1. The procedure is the same as in forming in line (paragraph 6.5) with the following
   exceptions:
      6.6.1.1. The squadrons in mass formation are marched onto the parade ground from
      either flank on a line well to the rear of the ready line.
      6.6.1.2. The group is formed first on the ready line and, at the first note of Adjutant’s
      Call, moved to the final line.
   6.6.2. When space is limited, the squadron is brought on the parade ground in a column of
   flights and massed left as the flights come on to the ready line.
6.7. Dismissing the Group.
   6.7.1. The group commander commands DISMISS YOUR SQUADRONS.
 72                                                    AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   6.7.2. The squadron commanders salute the group commander, march their squadrons to the
   place of dismissal, and dismiss them.
   6.7.3. After the squadrons march off, the group commander dismisses the staff.
   6.7.4. If the group commander desires to release the squadrons to their commanders without
   directing that the squadrons be dismissed promptly, the command TAKE CHARGE OF
   YOUR SQUADRONS is given. The squadron commanders salute the group commander
   and take charge of their squadrons.

Section 6C—Wing Formation and Review

6.8. Formations.
   6.8.1. On special occasions, the wing may be formed in line with groups in mass formation.
   However, the normal formation for the wing during a review is in line with squadrons in
   mass formation, as shown in Figure 6.4
   6.8.2. The interval between squadrons is 6 paces, and the interval between groups or
   between the group and the band is 12 paces.
   6.8.3. The color guard is positioned in the center of the formation and is considered when
   measuring interval.
   6.8.4. Distance is measured from the rear of the leading element to the front of the element
   next in order of march.
6.9. Review. A review is the formation of troops in group or wing marching in a prescribed
manner. The purpose is to inspect the degree of drill proficiency of officers and airmen and the
state of readiness of equipment.
   6.9.1. A review may be held to allow a higher commander, official, or dignitary to observe
   the state of training in a command. It may consist of the following parts:
       6.9.1.1. Formation of troops.
       6.9.1.2. Inspection of troops (from the reviewing stand or as outlined in the chapter 7).
       6.9.1.3. March in review.
   6.9.2. Two or more groups are formed on the final line and presented to the troop
   commander. The adjutant, by order of the troop commander, takes the post in line with the
   staff. The troop commander may then present the troops to the reviewing officer. Inspection
   of troops may follow if the reviewing officer desires. (See chapter 7 for more detailed
   instructions).
6.10. Sequence of Review Commands. See Figure 6.5
6.11. Sequence of Review and Inspection Commands. See Figure 6.6

   units of an appropriate size as shown below.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                81


Figure 7.1. Preparation for Parade.




      7.5.1.1. Groups in Line (Column) With Squadron in Line (Column). The optimum size
      of this formation should be four by eight with staff positions as indicated in figures 6.2
      and 6.3. However, this formation may be reduced to any depth (figure A1.1) down to
      three with the staff positions adjusted accordingly.
      7.5.1.2. Wing in Line With Squadrons in Mass Formation. The optimum size of this
      formation should be eight by eight with staff positions as indicated in Figure 5.5 and
      Figure 6.4 However, this formation may be reduced to a front of six and any depth down
      to three with staff positions adjusted accordingly. (Note: Formations in conjunction with
      USAFA, Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), OTS, and Basic Military Training
      School (BMTS) training programs need not adhere to the optimum sizes described in this
      paragraphs and paragraph 7.5.1.1).
   7.5.2. Troops move into their position in an orderly manner. The Commander of Troops
   prescribes routes of march and time of arrival. After the frontage of units has been measured
   and the field appropriately marked, units occupy their places in line as shown in Figure 7.2
   If a second line of troops is required, the distance is 18 paces.
 82                                                    AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


Figure 7.2. Formation of Troops for Parade.




   7.5.3. In ceremonies of a wing or larger unit, especially when troops pass in review in mass
   formation, special arrangements should be made to provide for breaking up into columns
   after passing in review. This is done by assigning areas into which the different units can
   move without blocking the line of march.
   7.5.4. Where units larger than a wing participate, the appropriate command designations and
   staffing are substituted.
7.6. Adjutant’s Call.
   7.6.1. The adjutant takes a position on the final line six paces to the right of the first unit,
   faces down line, and begins the ceremony by commanding the band to sound Adjutant’s Call.
   At the first note of the music, squadron commanders face their units and call them to
   attention. If the parade consists of more than one group, at the sound of Adjutant’s Call, the
   group adjutant’s face about and move to the final line. They halt three paces from the
   squadrons, align on the wing adjutant, and face to the right. Where a unit larger than a wing
   is involved, group and wing adjutants retain their positions in the staff of their commanders.
   7.6.2. The group adjutants remain on line until all elements in their groups have come on
   line. At adjutant’s cadence, they join the group staff by the most direct route.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  83


7.7. March On.
   7.7.1. As soon as Adjutant’s Call is played, in order from right to left in each group, the
   squadron commanders give the following commands: GUIDE ON LINE; Forward,
   MARCH; Squadron, HALT; At Close Interval, Dress Right, DRESS; Ready, FRONT;
   and COVER. On the command GUIDE ON LINE, the guide double times to the final line,
   halts, faces to the right, and aligns on the adjutant.
   7.7.2. The squadron commander halts the squadron so the chest of the first person in the
   right file touches the right shoulder of the guide.
   7.7.3. The squadron commander dresses the squadron. After the flight commanders have
   checked the alignment (only the A Flight officer in squadron mass), the squadron commander
   commands Ready, FRONT and COVER. The squadron commander then faces to the front
   and aligns on other commanders to the right.
   7.7.4. If a larger number of units are participating and considerable time is required for the
   march on, the squadron commander should give the squadron parade rest after it has been
   dressed. The squadron is called to attention immediately after the march-on music stops.
   7.7.5. The guides of squadrons other than the leading squadron align on the guides of
   squadrons to their right. If the squadrons form group mass as they come on line, only the
   guide of the leading squadron moves on line on the command GUIDE ON LINE. The
   group commander dresses the group, and the squadron commander on the right checks the
   alignment. After the group is dressed, the group commander faces to the front.
7.8. Guidon Bearer. Guidon bearers execute right face while the squadron is dressed. This
action enables bearers to position themselves on their own squadrons and to cover behind other
guidon bearers to the right. They face to the front on the command Ready, FRONT.
7.9. Guides Post.
   7.9.1. After all elements come on line, the band stops playing and the adjutant marches at
   adjutant’s cadence to a point between the Commander of Troops and the front line of
   commanders. The adjutant halts facing down line of the troops, executes left face, and
   commands in a loud and distinct voice G-u-i-d-e-s, POST.
   7.9.2. If in mass formation, on the command Guides, POST, the guides move to their
   positions in the ranks by executing a left face and taking one pace forward.
7.10. Sound Off or Trooping the Line.
   7.10.1. After giving the troops parade rest, the adjutant commands SOUND OFF. The
   band, in place, plays the sound off of three chords. At the conclusion of the third chord, the
   band moves forward, playing a march in quick time. It executes left turn to march across the
   front of the troops midway between the adjutant and front line of commanders. When the
   band has passed to the left of the line of troops, it counter marches and returns over the same
   ground to the right of the line. After it has passed beyond the right of the line of troops, it
   executes right turn. When the entire band has passed the front rank of the troops, it again
   counter marches and halts in its original position. When it ceases playing the march, the
   sound off is played again. This entire movement is called trooping the line.
 84                                                   AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   7.10.2. If it is not desired that the band troop the line, the adjutant commands In Place,
   SOUND OFF. On this command, the band plays the three chords of sound off and the
   introduction to a march, then repeats the three chords of sound off.
   7.10.3. The Commander of Troops and staff stand at attention during the sound off
   ceremony.
7.11. Officers Center.
   7.11.1. Immediately after publishing the orders, the adjutant commands Officers, Center,
   MARCH; then faces about and takes a position one pace to the right and 1 1/2 paces to the
   rear of the Commander of Troops.
   7.11.2. (Note: In this paragraph, words and numbers in parentheses apply when the
   group is in line with squadrons in line) . On the command OFFICERS, squadron
   commanders take eight (two) paces forward; guidon bearers execute carry guidon and take
   five paces forward (one step backward); the A Flight commander takes six paces forward
   (stand fast); the B Flight commander takes four paces forward (two steps backward); and the
   C Flight commander takes two paces forward (four steps backward). Officers and guidon
   bearers in the rear squadrons (second line of squadrons) move around the front line of
   squadrons on the flank nearest the center and assume positions on line with other officers and
   guidon bearers equal to their positions. When the formation includes a second line of
   squadrons, flight commanders are omitted from officers center and first sergeants do not take
   commanders positions.
   7.11.3. On the command CENTER, officers and guidon bearers face to the center.
   7.11.4. On the command MARCH, the band plays and the officers and guidon bearers
   march toward the center, maintaining relative positions. The first sergeant occupies the
   command position in the absence of the commander. On the commands OFFICERS and
   CENTER, the first sergeants stand fast. On the command MARCH, each moves by the
   most direct route around the flank of his or her respective mass nearest the Colors and halts
   abreast of the front rank. After officers and guidon bearers are positioned and the senior
   group commander commands Forward, MARCH, each first sergeant moves by the most
   direct route to the command position in front of his or her mass.
   7.11.5. On reaching the center, each individual halts and automatically faces the front at
   close interval. The group commanders and their staffs close to the center, maintaining
   relative unit positions (Figure 7.3).
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  85


Figure 7.3. Officers Center.




   7.11.6. When officers and guidons have reached the center and faced to the front, the right
   and left flank commanders say Sir (Ma’am), all in from the right (left). The senior officer
   then commands Forward, MARCH. The center officer or airman in each rank is the base
   element, and the senior officer commands Officers, HALT. The officers halt and present
   arms in three counts. (Guidon bearers halt and present arms in four counts.) (Note: Guidon
   bearers should execute the first movement of present arms on the preparatory command
   Officers.)
   7.11.7. The Commander of Troops returns the salute and commands Order, ARMS to end
   the salute and return guidon bearers to carry guidon.
   7.11.8. If a unit award (streamer) is to be presented, the Commander of Troops commands
   the appropriate unit guidon Front and Center, MARCH. On the command Center, the
   designated guidon bearer takes one step to the rear and faces to the nearest flank. On the
   command MARCH, a route is taken around the nearest flank to a position four paces in front
   of the Commander of Troops. The bearer then executes the individual salute with the guidon
   so it is in a convenient position for the streamer to be attached. The guidon bearer returns to
   the carry position and executes the individual guidon salute. The Commander of Troops
   commands Post and then MARCH. The guidon bearer returns to the normal position by the
   same route he or she took when moving to the front.
7.12. Officers Post.
   7.12.1. The Commander of Troops commands Officers, Post, MARCH.
   7.12.2. On the command Post, officers, guidon bearers, and first sergeants face about.
   7.12.3. On the command MARCH, they step off. (First sergeants return to their position
   within the mass, reversing the route they used to take command in the squadron commanders
 86                                                     AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   absence.) The senior group commander commands Officers, HALT when the leading rank
   is approximately four paces from the final line. Then the command Post, MARCH is given.
   7.12.4. On the command Post, officers and guidon bearers face outward toward their
   respective group.
   7.12.5. On the command MARCH, officers and guidon bearers move off in succession at
   four-pace distances. Squadron commanders, flight commanders, and guidon bearers execute
   right (left) flank upon arriving at their respective units and halt in their original positions in
   the formation. All face about at the squadron commanders command Post. Guidon bearers
   return to order guidon. The commander and staffs march to their positions as a unit. At the
   conclusion of these movements, the band stops playing.
   7.12.6. During the execution of officers center, all guidon bearers remain at carry guidon
   except when saluting.
7.13. Presentation of Troops.
   7.13.1. A distinctive feature of the parade ceremony or review is the formal presentation of
   the troops to the Commander of Troops. The adjutant does this by commanding the Airmen
   to salute the Commander of Troops. The Commander of Troops returns the salute in
   acknowledgment before personally taking charge of the ceremony.
   7.13.2. Later in the ceremony, the Commander of Troops makes a similar presentation of the
   troops to the reviewing officer, presenting them to the reviewing officer by stating Sir
   (Ma’am), I present the command. Honors are given to the reviewing officer when the
   grade is appropriate. If honors are given, the reviewing officer and staff salute at the first
   note of the music and hold the salute until the music ends. The reviewing officer then directs
   the continuation of the review or ceremony.
7.14. Honors.
   7.14.1. Special military honors are reserved for military and national dignitaries who
   participate in ceremonies.
   7.14.2. In the Air Force, honors consist of Ruffles and Flourishes and appropriate music by
   the band as authorized by AFI 34-1201, Protocol, Table A2.1 During the presentation of
   honors, military spectators come to attention and face (if feasible) the person receiving the
   honors, and all personnel salute.
7.15. Inspection by a Reviewing Officer.
   7.15.1. Upon announcement by the Commander of Troops that the command is ready for
   inspection, the reviewing officer, accompanied by designated members, moves forward and
   halts six paces in front of the Commander of Troops. The two exchange salutes; their staffs
   do not salute. The band plays while the reviewing officer is at the front, side, or rear of an
   organization. The Commander of Troops then guides the reviewing party around the
   formation, beginning with the unit on the right of the line, passing in front of the line and
   then around the rear of the formation. In large formations, the reviewing party normally
   passes between the line of wing, group, and squadron commanders. The Commander of
   Troops and local commander march on the side of the reviewing officer that is away from the
   airmen. They are followed by the staffs of the Commander of Troops, local commander (if
   present), and reviewing officer. Each staff follows its own commander in a column of files.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   87


   7.15.2. The reviewing officer may direct the staff and flag to either remain at the post or
   accompany the reviewing officer.
   7.15.3. When the inspection is made in motor vehicles, the vehicles drive up to the post of
   the reviewing officer after the presentation of the troops or completion of the honors, and the
   reviewing party enters the vehicles. If available, open vehicles should be used. In each
   vehicle, one seat on the right side (the side away from the airmen during inspection) is left
   vacant. The vehicles move to the post of the Commander of Troops and stop. The
   Commander of Troops exchanges salutes with the reviewing officer, enters the reviewing
   officer’s vehicle, and occupies the vacant seat. The staff officers occupy the vacant seats in
   the remaining vehicles. The vehicles proceed on the route of inspection as already described.
   7.15.4. As the reviewing party approaches, each squadron or group commander (when the
   group is in mass formation) brings his or her unit to attention. The command Eyes, RIGHT
   is given. All service members execute eyes right. As soon as the reviewing officer comes
   into their line of vision, they follow with their eyes, turning their heads, until the reviewing
   officer reaches their front. At this point, the head and eyes of each person remain fixed to the
   front. As the reviewing party reaches a point six paces to the right of the squadron
   commander, the hand salute is executed by the squadron commander and held until returned
   by the officer making the inspection. Flight commanders salute with the squadron
   commander. Guidon bearers do not present guidon, but execute eyes right. While the group
   is inspected, the group commander and staff are at attention.
   7.15.5. The reviewing officer and those accompanying the reviewing officer salute the US
   flag when passing in front of it. Members of the color guard execute eyes right as members
   of the inspection party arrive six paces from them, and they follow the same procedures as
   outlined in paragraph 7.15.4 The unit colors are dipped.
   7.15.6. The reviewing officer makes such general inspection of the command as desired
   while passing around the troops. (A detailed inspection is not a part of a review.)
   7.15.7. On arriving at the right of the band after passing around the line, the Commander of
   Troops salutes and halts. The reviewing officer returns the salute and proceeds with the staff
   to the normal post. When the reviewing officer and staff have passed the Commander of
   Troops and resumed their positions on the reviewing stand, the Commander of Troops and
   staff move directly to their posts facing the reviewing officer. When members of the
   inspecting party are in motor vehicles, a stop is made at the post of the Commander of
   Troops. The Commander of Troops dismounts, exchanges salutes with the reviewing officer,
   and returns to the appropriate post. Staff members dismount and return to their posts at the
   same time. The vehicles then proceed to the post of the reviewing officer, where the
   members of the reviewing party dismount and return to their posts. The Commander of
   Troops then salutes. The reviewing officer returns the salute and commands MARCH THE
   COMMAND IN REVIEW.
7.16. Presentation of Decorations.
   7.16.1. The presentation of decorations and awards to military or civilian personnel and the
   appending of unit decoration streamers, battle honors, and service streamers onto an Air
   Force organizational flag are made at a parade. The same parade may honor persons and
   units who are to be decorated or receive awards and persons who are retiring.

  7.16.2. Persons to be decorated are positioned before the start of the ceremony on the right
  side of the reviewing stand. They line up in column according to rank of the decorations to
  be conferred, with the highest ranking decoration in front.
  7.16.3. After the command has been presented, the reviewing officer instructs the
  Commander of Troops to have the persons to be decorated (receive awards, etc.) and the
  Colors brought forward.
     7.16.3.1. The Commander of Troops commands Order, ARMS and then commands
     Persons to be decorated (receive awards, be retired, etc.) and Colors, CENTER,
     MARCH. On the command MARCH, the music starts and the Commander of Troops
     moves forward and halts six paces from the front rank of the detachment. He or she faces
     about, commands Detachment, Forward, MARCH (or while marching, commands
     Detachment, Forward, MARCH), and then executes a march to the rear, ensuring the
     detachment is in step with the music.
     7.16.3.2. On the command CENTER, the wing staff officer executes right face and the
     wing adjutant executes left face. They move forward three paces, halt, and execute about
     face. As the Colors pass, the senior officer gives present arms. After the Colors have
     passed, the senior officer gives order arms. Staff members then return to their original
     position under command of their senior officer.
     7.16.3.3. The Commander of Troops continues directly toward the reviewing officer.
     The dress is center in all ranks. After reaching a point five paces from the reviewing
     officer, the Commander of Troops halts the group on the command Detachment, HALT.
     The band stops playing when the detachment halts.
     7.16.3.4. After the detachment halts, the persons to be decorated (receive awards, etc.)
     move forward, execute a column left, and halt at a position five paces in front of and
     centered on the Colors. They then face to the left.
     7.16.3.5. If any organizational Air Force flags are to be decorated, they are placed in a
     single rank at the left of the reviewing stand according to the rank of the decoration to be
     bestowed, with the highest ranking decoration at the rear.
     7.16.3.6. The flagbearers march forward, execute a column right, and halt at a position
     three paces in front of and centered on the persons to be decorated (receive awards, etc.)
     or on the Colors. They then face to their right.
     7.16.3.7. The Commander of Troops salutes the reviewing officer and reports Sir
     (Ma’am), the persons (flags) to be decorated (receive awards, etc.) and the Colors
     are present. The reviewing officer returns the salute and directs that the command be
     presented.
  7.16.4. The Commander of Troops passes around the right flank of the detachment and
  proceeds directly to the normal post. On reaching the post, he or she brings the airmen to
  present arms, faces about, and brings the staff to present arms. The band then plays the
  national anthem or To The Color. On completion of the music, the Commander of Troops
  brings the staff to order arms, faces about, and brings the airmen to order arms and parade
  rest. On the command of the senior flagbearer, the persons to be decorated (receive awards,
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  89


   etc.) and the color guard come to present arms for the national anthem or To The Color.
   When the music ceases, they execute order arms on the command.
   7.16.5. The citation or order announcing the awards is read. As the citation (order) is read,
   the reviewing officer and staff (or certain members of the staff) advance to the flags and the
   line of persons to be decorated. The reviewing officer fastens the streamer immediately
   below the staff ornament of the flagstaff.
      7.16.5.1. Medals are pinned on the left breast pocket of military personnel (and others at
      the discretion of the presenting officer). When posthumous awards are accepted on
      behalf of deceased Air Force personnel, the decoration may be handed to the next of kin
      in the open decoration container.
      7.16.5.2. The reviewing officer then invites the recipient of the medal to take a position
      on his right or left in the reviewing stand. At the command of the senior officer or
      airman present, the persons decorated form a line on the left of the reviewing officer or as
      directed.
      7.16.5.3. The flags are returned to their posts by the most direct route. Once the flags are
      positioned, the Commander of Troops salutes the reviewing officer, but gives no report.
      The reviewing officer returns the salute and directs the Commander of Troops to march
      the command in review.
7.17. March in Review.
   7.17.1. When the reviewing party is again in place after the inspection of troops or
   presentation of decorations and awards, the Commander of Troops commands PASS IN
   REVIEW.
   7.17.2. On the command PASS IN REVIEW, the band changes direction by executing
   column right, moves out on the route of march, and comes to a halt.
   7.17.3. In order from right to left, the group commanders give the command Column of
   Squadrons, Right Squadron, Right Turn, MARCH to put the airmen in march in the
   formation designated for review. On the command Right Squadron, squadron commanders
   face about. On the command Right Turn, each squadron commander sounds off with the
   appropriate supplementary command (Right Turn or Stand Fast). The band begins playing
   and marches forward on the command MARCH, given by the group commander. If the band
   is placed between groups in the center facing the reviewing stand, it marches forward on the
   command of execution, inclines to the right, and halts in a position in front of and facing the
   reviewing officer at least 12 paces from the left flank of the marching airmen. If the band is
   placed to the right of the groups, other units move out in succession to follow in column at
   the prescribed distance (figure 7.4).

Figure 7.4. March in Review.




   7.17.4. The band and each unit change direction at the points indicated on the route of
   march.
   7.17.5. When the units are in mass formation, at each change of direction, the commander of
   each squadron (or group if in group formation) in turn commands Left Turn, MARCH. The
   commander faces the formation and marches backward until the turn is completed.
   7.17.6. The wing and group commanders and their staffs move into position in the column at
   the head of their airmen after the second left turn.
   7.17.7. The proper distance between units, including wing and group staffs and the Colors, is
   12 paces.
   7.17.8. The Commander of Troops and the wing and group commanders command Eyes,
   RIGHT when they arrive six paces from the reviewing stand. Commanders and their staffs
   execute eyes right and the hand salute. They end the salute and face to the front when their
   staffs have passed six paces beyond the reviewing stand by commanding Ready, FRONT.
   The reviewing officer returns their salutes. Other members of the reviewing party do not
   salute.
   7.17.9. After executing ready front, the Commander of Troops turns out of the column and
   takes a post on the right side of the reviewing officer. The members of the staff accompany
   the Commander of Troops, maintaining relative positions. When the last unit has passed, the
   Commander of Troops faces the reviewing stand and salutes the reviewing officer.
   7.17.10. Band commanders and drum majors execute and end their salutes at the point
   prescribed for the other commanders. When it has passed the reviewing officer, the first
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                91


   band executes column left three times to take a position in front of and facing the reviewing
   officer and at least 12 paces from the left flank of the marching airmen. The first band
   continues to play until the band following approaches the post of the reviewing officer. The
   first band then stops playing and may leave the field. The band following begins playing as
   soon as the preceding band has stopped playing and so forth.
   7.17.11. In large commands, two bands may remain alongside each other after they have
   turned out of column to alternate playing while the airmen pass in review. Bands may be
   massed and posted as directed by the Commander of Troops.
   7.17.12. Each squadron commander (or group commander if the formation is in group
   formation) turns his or her head to the right and commands Eyes, RIGHT. The command
   RIGHT is given when the squadron commander is six paces from the reviewing stand. On
   the command RIGHT, the squadron commander salutes and the officers in the front rank
   execute eyes right and salute simultaneously. No others salute. The commander keeps his or
   her head to the right until giving ready front.
   7.17.13. Airmen, except those on the right flank, execute eyes right. The guidon bearer
   executes present guidon. On the command Ready, FRONT, given by the squadron
   commander when the last rank of the unit is six paces beyond the reviewing stand, all
   officers end the salute. The guidon bearer executes carry guidon, and all airmen turn their

   7.17.15. The reviewing officer returns the salute of the Commander of Troops and the
   salutes of subordinate commanders down to and including the squadron commanders. Other
   members of the reviewing party do not salute.
7.18. Commander of Troops and Staff.
   7.18.1. Commanders reviewing their own airmen designate another officer as Commander of
   Troops. When the review is given for a visiting higher commander or civilian dignitary, the
   local commander designates a Commander of Troops so the local commander may
   accompany the visitors and receive the review with them.
   7.18.2. When the band stops playing the march-on music, the Commander of Troops and
   staff members, except the adjutant, take their positions between the front line commanders
   and the post of the reviewing officer, facing the airmen.
   7.18.3. Staff members do not salute with the commander when the airmen are presented.
   7.18.4. In a ceremony, the staff changes post (faces about) in the following manner:
      7.18.4.1. When the staff consists of one or two members, on the command Change Post,
      MARCH by the Commander of Troops, the staff officer moves forward three paces,
      halts, and executes an about face automatically without command. The Commander of
      Troops executes about face the same time as the staff faces about. When awards are
      presented, the Commander of Troops does not reverse the staff. In posting, the adjutant
      moves toward the Commander of Troops, marches 45 degrees to the left, halts in
      position, and executes about face.

      7.18.4.2. When the staff consists of more than two members, on the command Change
      Post, MARCH by the Commander of Troops, the adjutant moves four paces forward,
      faces to the left in marching, and advances to a position diagonally opposite the original
      position. Other members of the staff face to the right and follow the path of the adjutant
      until they have reached relative opposite positions. They then halt and face the reviewing
      stand without command to complete the movement. In advancing to receive the report,
      the adjutant moves forward, turns 45 degrees to the left until directly in front of the
      commander, turns forward again, and advances to a position between the front line of
      commanders and the Commander of Troops. The same route is used in returning to the
      post.
7.19. Reviewing Party.
   7.19.1. The reviewing officer (the senior officer participating in the ceremony), local
   commander (if not acting as Commander of Troops), distinguished persons invited to
   accompany the reviewing officer (but not themselves receiving the reviews), staffs, and
   airmen take positions facing the airmen as shown in Figure 7.5
   7.19.2. The reviewing officer may designate an individual to return the salute as the units
   pass in review. If this person is military and junior to the reviewing officer, he or she takes a
   position to the left of the reviewing officer.
   7.19.3. An officer from the local staff is designated to escort distinguished persons and show
   them their proper places. A civilian receiving a review takes a position on the right of the
   local commander. If necessary, timely explanations of the ceremony are made to the civilian
   (Figure 7.5 for exact positions).

7.21. General’s Flagbearer.
   7.21.1. The general’s flag at the order is the position of attention as shown in Figure 7.7
   The flagbearer keeps the ferrule on the ground by touching the outside of the right shoe
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   97


  opposite the toe of the right foot. The staff is held in the “V” of the right hand (between the
  thumb and the extended and joined fingers). The right hand and arm are kept behind the staff
  with the arm bent naturally. The staff is rested against the hollow of the shoulder.
  7.21.2. The carry is the position in which the ferrule is approximately 6 inches from the
  ground. Facings, alignments, or formal marching require the general’s flag to be at the carry.
  The staff is kept in a vertical position throughout the movements.
  7.21.3. Parade rest is executed by sliding the hand up the staff and inclining the staff of the
  flag forward at arm’s length with the hand at belt level.
  7.21.4. To execute the order while at the carry, the flagbearer lets the staff slide through the
  right hand until the ferrule is on the ground, in line with, and touching the toe of the right
  shoe. The staff is re-grasped with the right hand as at the carry position.
  7.21.5. To execute the carry while at the order, the flagbearer grasps the staff with the left
  hand while at the same time loosening the grip of the right hand on the staff. The flag is
  raised vertically with the left hand, letting the staff slide through the right hand until the
  ferrule is approximately 6 inches from the ground. The staff is then re-grasped with the right
  hand. The left hand is cut away smartly to the left side.
  7.21.6. To execute present when at carry or order, the flagbearer places the left hand so it
  grasps the staff just under the bottom of the flag. The left arm is extended fully until it is
  parallel to the ground. At the same time, the right hand is raised (still grasping the staff) and
  placed against the right hip as shown in Figure 7.8 To execute the order or carry position
  from present, the procedure is reversed.
  7.21.7. On the arrival of a general officer, the sequence of events for the general’s flagbearer
  is as follows:
     7.21.7.1. The flagbearer takes a position in front of the aircraft or staff car, goes to
     present, and unfurls the flag as the general leaves the vehicle.

Figure 7.8. Generals Flag at Present.




       7.21.7.2. The flagbearer then takes a position one pace to the right and 1 1/2 paces to the
       rear of the general. The flag bearer maintains this relative position at all times, when
       practical, including after the ceremony, during a social event following the ceremony, etc.
       7.21.7.3. During the parade or review, the general’s flag may be presented as the general
       desires and specifically on the following occasions:
          7.21.7.3.1. During the playing of the national anthem or To The Color.
          7.21.7.3.2. During the playing of Ruffles and Flourishes.
          7.21.7.3.3. As the Colors pass by.
          7.21.7.3.4. When the general’s flag is furled and cased, a salute is required by the
          flag bearer. (A guidon salute is executed.) Refer to AFI 34-1201, paragraph 2.27. for
          guidance on when to furl and case a general’s flag.
7.22. Relay of Commands to Troops.
   7.22.1. If there is only one group participating in the ceremony, the adjutant and Commander
   of Troops give commands directly to the airmen.
 100                                                   AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   7.22.2. If the formation consists of a wing with two or more groups, the adjutant and
   Commander of Troops relay their commands through the group commanders, such as Give
   Your Groups Parade Rest. These commands are given with moderate volume and force.
   Group commanders should permit time between the preparatory command and the command
   of execution so the squadron commanders can echo the preparatory command. The group
   commanders give commands in succession, starting from the right flank.
   7.22.3. If the formation consists of two or more wings, the commands are relayed from the
   adjutant or Commander of Troops to the wing commanders and then to the group
   commanders, who give the commands to the airmen. For example, if the command of the
   adjutant is Give Your Wings Parade Rest, the command of the wing commanders is Give
   Your Groups Parade Rest and the command of the group commanders is Parade, REST.

Section 7C—Raising and Lowering the Flag

7.23. Reveille.
   7.23.1. Reveille is the signal for the start of the official duty day. Because the time for the
   start of the duty day varies between bases, the commander designates the specified time for
   reveille. If the commander desires, a reveille ceremony may accompany the raising of the
   flag. This ceremony takes place in the vicinity of the base flagstaff and is held after sunrise.
   7.23.2. In the unit area, reveille is normally held, using the formation of squadron in line.
   This formation is used when a reveille ceremony is not held at the base flagstaff.
7.24. Events Accompanying Flag Raising at the Reveille Ceremony.
   7.24.1. Shortly before the specified time for reveille, airmen are marched to a pre-designated
   position near the base flagstaff, halted, faced toward the flagstaff, and dressed. The flag
   security detail arrives at the flagstaff at this time and remains at attention.
   7.24.2. The unit commander commands Parade REST.
   7.24.3. At the specified time for reveille, the unit commander commands SOUND
   REVEILLE. The flag detail assumes the position of attention, moves to the flagstaff, and
   attaches the flag to the halyards.
   7.24.4. After reveille has been played, the unit commander commands Squadron
   ATTENTION and Present ARMS and then faces the flagstaff and executes present arms.
   On this signal, the national anthem or To The Color is sounded.
   7.24.5. On the first note of the national anthem or To The Color, the flag security detail
   begins to raise the flag briskly. The senior member of the detail holds the flag to keep it from
   touching the ground.
   7.24.6. The unit commander holds the salute until the last note of the music is played. Then
   he or she executes order arms, faces about, and commands Order, ARMS. The airmen are
   then marched back to the dismissal area.
7.25. Raising the Flag.
   7.25.1. When practical, a detail consisting of an NCO and two airmen hoists the flag. This
   detail may be armed with sidearms (if the special equipment of the guard includes sidearms).
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   101


   7.25.2. The detail is formed in line with the NCO carrying the flag in the center. The detail
   is then marched to the flagstaff and halted, and the flag is attached to the halyards. The flag
   is always raised and lowered from the leeward side of the flagstaff. The two airmen attend
   the halyards, taking a position facing the staff to hoist the flag without entangling the
   halyards. The NCO continues to hold the flag until it is hoisted clear of the grasp, taking
   particular care that no portion of the flag touches the ground. When the flag is clear of the
   grasp, the NCO comes to attention and executes present arms.
   7.25.3. On the last note of the National Anthem or “To the Color” or after the flag has been
   hoisted to the staff head, all members of the detail execute order arms on command of the
   senior member. The halyards are then secured to the cleat of the staff or, if appropriate, the
   flag is lowered to half-staff and the halyard secured. The detail is formed again and marched
   to the dismissal area.
7.26. Retreat Ceremony.
   7.26.1. The retreat ceremony serves a twofold purpose. It signals the end of the official duty
   day and serves as a ceremony for paying respect to the flag. Because the time for the end of
   the duty day varies, the commander designates the specific time for the retreat ceremony.
   7.26.2. The retreat ceremony may take place at the squadron area, on the base parade
   ground, or in the vicinity of the flagstaff. If conducted at the base parade ground, retreat is a
   part of the parade ceremony. If conducted within the squadron area, it is usually a ceremony
   not involving a parade. If the retreat ceremony is conducted at the flagstaff, the units
   participating may be formed in line or they may be massed, depending upon the size and
   number of units and the space available.
   7.26.3. When persons not assigned to a formation are outdoors and in uniform, on the first
   note of retreat, they should face the flag (if visible) or music and assume the position of
   parade rest.
7.27. Events Accompanying Retreat Ceremony at the Flagstaff.
   7.27.1. Shortly before the specified time for retreat, the band and airmen participating in the
   ceremony are positioned facing the flagstaff and dressed. If marching to and from the
   flagstaff, the band precedes the airmen participating in the ceremony.
   7.27.2. If the band and airmen march to the flagstaff, a flag security detail also marches to
   the flagstaff, halts, and is given the command Parade, REST by the senior member. (See
   paragraph 7.28.1 for composition of the flag security detail.)
   7.27.3. As soon as the airmen are dressed, the commander commands Parade, REST. The
   commander then faces the flagstaff, assumes the position of the airmen, and waits for the
   specified time for retreat.
   7.27.4. The commander orders the band leader to sound retreat at the specified time by
   commanding SOUND RETREAT.
   7.27.5. The band plays retreat. If a band is not present, recorded music may be played over
   the base public address system. During the playing of retreat, junior members of the flag
   security detail assume the position of attention and move to the flagstaff to arrange the
   halyards for proper lowering of the flag. Once the halyards are arranged, the junior members
   of the flag security detail execute parade rest in unison.
 102                                                     AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   7.27.6. After the band finishes playing retreat, the commander faces about and commands
   Squadron (Group, etc.), ATTENTION.
   7.27.7. The commander then commands Present, ARMS. As soon as the airmen execute
   present arms, the commander faces to the front and also assumes present arms. The members
   of the flag security detail execute present arms on command by the commander.
   7.27.8. The band plays the national anthem or the bugler plays To The Color. The junior
   members of the flag security detail lower the flag slowly and with dignity.
   7.27.9. The commander executes order arms when the last note of the National Anthem or
   “To the Color” is played and the flag has been securely grasped. The commander faces
   about, gives the airmen Order, ARMS, and then faces to the front.
   7.27.10. The flag security detail folds the flag. The senior airman of the detail remains at
   attention while the flag is being folded unless he or she is needed to control the flag.
   7.27.11. When the flag is folded, the flag security detail, with the senior airman on the right
   and the flagbearer in the center, marches to a position three paces from the commander. (In
   an informal ceremony, the detail marches three paces from the officer of the day). The senior
   airman salutes and reports Sir (Ma’am), the flag is secured. The commander returns the
   salute, and the flag security detail marches away. The airmen are then marched to their areas
   and dismissed.
7.28. Lowering the Flag.
   7.28.1. When practical, the persons lowering the flag should be an NCO and three airmen for
   the all- purpose flag and an NCO and five airmen for the base flag. The detail is formed and
   marched to the flagstaff, and the halyards are detached and attended from the leeward side.
   On the first note of the national anthem or, if no band is present, To The Color, the members
   of the detail not lowering the flag execute present arms. The lowering of the flag is
   coordinated with the playing of the music so the two are completed at the same time. The
   senior member commands the detail Order, ARMS when the flag is low enough to be
   received. If at half-staff, the flag is hoisted briskly to the staff head while retreat is sounded,
   and then it is lowered on the first note of the national anthem or To The Color.
   7.28.2. The flag is detached from the halyards and folded. The halyards are secured to the
   staff.

Section 7D—Change of Command

7.29. Sequence of Events.
   7.29.1. Formation of troops.
   7.29.2. Presentation of troops and honors to the senior commander, when participating, and
   the former commander.
   7.29.3. Inspection of troops.
   7.29.4. Presentation of decorations and awards if scheduled.
   7.29.5. Formal change of command. This may include a brief address by participating
   commander if he or she desires.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 103


   7.29.6. March in review.
7.30. Flag Procedures for General Officers.
   7.30.1. Ruffles and Flourishes and other music must be appropriate to the grade of the senior
   commander participating in the review (AFI 34-1201, Table A 2.1. Table of Honors).
7.31. Formal Change of Command.
   7.31.1. If the higher echelon commander desires, the change of command may be performed
   off and in front of the reviewing stand. This is done to enable everyone to actually see the
   former commander and new commander relinquish and assume command, respectively.
   7.31.2. The primary purpose of a change of command ceremony is to allow subordinates to
   witness the formality of command change from one officer to another. Therefore, the
   ceremony should be official, formal, and brief and conducted with great dignity.
   7.31.3. At a parade ceremony attended by the higher echelon commander, the order directing
   the change of command is read after the presentation of decorations and award, if scheduled.
   Otherwise, the order is read after the national anthem and officers center portion in the
   normal review sequence.
      7.31.3.1. After the order is read, the flag/guidon is exchanged during the change of
      command as a symbolic gesture providing a tangible view of the command authority
      being transferred from one commander to the next. The sequence for the exchange begins
      with three participants standing abreast, from left to right as viewed from the audience,
      presiding officer, outgoing commander, and incoming commander. A fourth participant,
      the flag/guidon bearer, takes a position behind and between presiding officer and
      outgoing commander. The flag/guidon bearer gives a subdued command, “Officers,
      Center”; the presiding officer executes a left face while the two commanders execute a
      right face. The outgoing commander salutes the presiding officer, while stating,
      “Sir/Ma’am, I relinquish command.” The presiding officer returns salute. The outgoing
      commander takes the flag/guidon from the flag/guidon bearer, holding the flag/guidon
      angling the top of flag/guidon towards the head of the flag/guidon bearer, and presents it
      to the presiding officer, presiding officer hands on top. The outgoing commander takes
      one step to the right, two steps back and one step to the left; simultaneously, the incoming
      commander takes two steps forward, taking the outgoing commander’s place. The
      presiding officer presents the flag/guidon to the incoming commander who firmly
      receives the flag/guidon and passes it to the flag/guidon bearer. The incoming
      commander salutes the presiding officer, while stating, “Sir/Ma’am, I assume command.”
      The presiding officer returns the salute. The flag/guidon bearer gives a subdued
      command, “Officers, Post”. All three officers face forward. (Refer to AFI 34-1201,
      paragraph 14.5.5. for guidance on assumption of command ceremonies.)
      7.31.3.2. The Commander of Troops then directs the formation to be brought to present
      arms and presents the command to the higher echelon commander, who directs the march
      in review. The higher echelon commander, former commander, or new commander may
      take one step forward to accept the pass in review.
      7.31.3.3. The flagbearers may change positions at the same time and in the same manner
      as their respective commanders.
 104                                                   AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


       7.31.3.4. The ceremony should be performed after the Colors are brought forward for the
       national anthem, whether it is a parade or a review sequence (change of command only).
       7.31.3.5. If no decorations are awarded, the higher echelon commander directs the
       Commander of Troops to have the Colors come forward. Once the Colors and
       Commander of Troops are in place, the former and new commanders march out to a
       position between the Colors and Commander of Troops. The Commander of Troops
       salutes and reports Sir (Ma’am), the Colors are present. The Commander of Troops
       then returns to his or her original position and gives the airmen present arms for the
       national anthem. After the national anthem, order arms, and parade rest, the narrator
       begins to read the order.
          7.31.3.5.1. The higher echelon commander steps off the reviewing stand and moves
          to a position directly in front of the former commander. Refer to paragraph 7.31.3.1
          above for procedures flag/guidon exchange procedures.
          7.31.3.5.2. When salutes have been exchanged, the higher echelon commander
          directs the new and former commanders to join him or her on the reviewing stand.
          All three commanders move to their right and return to the reviewing stand to face the
          airmen, with the new commander to the higher echelon commander’s left and the
          former commander to the new commander’s left.
          7.31.3.5.3. The Colors return to their original position once the commanders depart
          for the reviewing stand. Once the colors are in position, the Commander of Troops
          salutes the higher echelon commander without a report. The higher echelon
          commander exchanges salutes and directs MARCH THE COMMAND IN
          REVIEW.

Section 7E—Colors

7.32. Color Guard.
   7.32.1. When practical, the color guard consists of two NCOs (the flagbearers) and two
   experienced airmen (the guards). When selecting a color guard, make every effort to ensure
   uniformity in height among members.
       7.32.1.1. The carrying of the US and Air Force flags is an honor bestowed only on
       responsible NCOs. When possible, flagbearers and guards who have had experience in
       this function should be selected. If experienced personnel are not available, those selected
       should be thoroughly trained in the manual of the Colors (paragraph 7.33) and made
       fully aware of the honor of their duty.
       7.32.1.2. The flagbearers are unarmed. The guards are armed with rifles or revolvers,
       but ammunition will not be issued to color guards performing a strictly ceremonial
       function. (T-1).
       7.32.1.3. The senior flagbearer carries the US flag, commands the color guard, and gives
       the necessary commands for movements and rendering honors. The junior flagbearer
       carries the Air Force flag. The Air Force flag is placed on the marching left of the US
       flag in whatever direction the flags face. When only the US flag is carried, the color
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                105


      guard is composed of one flagbearer and two guards. The Air Force flag is never carried
      without the US flag.
   7.32.2. With the flagbearers in the center, the color guard is formed and marched in one rank
   at close interval. The color guard does not execute to the rear march or about face. When
   the unit to which the color guard is attached executes a facing movement, the color guard, on
   command of the senior flagbearer, executes a right or left about. To halt the color guard,
   give the command Color Guard, HALT. When the unit to which the color guard is attached
   marches to the flank in column, the color guard executes half right (left) about. When the
   unit moves in a new direction for short distances, the color guard executes the about
   movement and halts in its proper place. The base or pivot point is the guard on the flank
   toward which the movement is directed. Each member turns (without pivot) around this
   point and maintains dress until the new direction is established.
   7.32.3. On command of the senior flagbearer, the guards of the color guard present arms on
   receiving and parting with the US flag. After parting with the US flag, the guard is brought
   to order arms by command of the senior remaining member, who is the right flank of the
   guard.
   7.32.4. Having received the US flag, the senior flagbearer conducts the color guard to its
   proper position in the center of the color squadron. After securing the US flag, the color
   guard is dismissed by the senior flagbearer.
   7.32.5. At drills and ceremonies in which the US and Air Force flags are carried (except
   escort of the US flag), the US and the Air Force flags are received by the color squadron
   before the formation of the command.
   7.32.6. The color squadron, formed with a 12-pace interval between flights and with its
   commander facing the front, receives the Colors as follows: the color guard, conducted by
   the senior flagbearer, approaches from the front and halts at a distance of 12 paces from the
   squadron commander. The squadron commander then faces the squadron and brings it to
   present arms, faces the US flag, and salutes. After a brief moment, the squadron commander
   again faces the squadron and brings it to order arms. The guards of the color guard execute
   present and order arms with the color squadron. The senior flagbearer then marches the color
   guard directly to its post. The color guard takes its position in the center when the squadron
   is in line or column and on the left when the squadron is in mass. When the color squadron
   joins the formation, the color guard takes its post on the final line.
   7.32.7. When in formation, the color guard executes at ease and rest with the color squadron,
   keeping the staffs on the US and Air Force flags vertical.
   7.32.8. When dismissing the color guard at the end of a drill or ceremony in which the US
   and Air Force flags have been carried, the color guard proceeds from its position and halts in
   front of and faces the squadron commander of the color squadron. The squadron presents
   arms. The color guard then escorts the US and Air Force flags to the commanders' office or
   other depository of flags. The color guard is dismissed from organizations smaller than a
   squadron (funeral escort) in a similar manner.
7.33. Manual of the Colors.

   7.33.1. Position of the Flag at the Order. At the order, the flagbearer rests the ferrule of the
   staff on the ground on line with and touching the toe of the right shoe. With the right hand,
   the staff is clasped at a convenient place, keeping the back of the hand to the right and
   holding the staff in a vertical position (Figure 7.9).

Figure 7.9. Position of Flags at the Order.




   7.33.2. Positions of the Flag at the Carry. At the carry, the ferrule of the staff rests in the
   socket of the sling. The flagbearer grasps the staff with the right hand at the height of the
   shoulder, only using the left hand to steady the staff in a strong wind. The staff is inclined
   slightly to the front. The flagbearer comes to the carry when the adjutant directs GIVE
   YOUR GROUPS PRESENT ARMS (Figure 7.10).
   7.33.3. Position of the Flag at Parade Rest. Parade rest with the flag is similar to parade
   rest for the individual airman except the flagbearer keeps the staff vertical (Figure 7.11).
   The order is resumed on the command ATTENTION. The order and parade rest are
   executed with the color squadron.
7.34. Escort of the US Flag.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                            107

Figure 7.11. Position of Flags at Parade Rest.




   7.34.1. Escort may be executed in the following circumstances: during the ceremony for a
   parade (when the group or wing formally receive the US flag as a part of the ceremony) and
108                                                   AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


  before the ceremony for a parade (when the airmen are formed as a unit on a separate parade
  area and marched to the designated area).
  7.34.2. When the ceremony or escort of the US flag is to take place, the color guard obtains
  the Air Force flag and takes its post with the ceremonial color squadron before the group is
  formed. This is done informally.
  7.34.3. After the wing is in line and the entire color guard is in position with the Air Force
  flag (but without the US flag), the group commander details a squadron (other than the
  ceremonial color squadron) to receive and escort the US flag to its place. During the
  ceremony, the wing Air Force color guard is at its post with the wing.
  7.34.4. The band moves straight to its front until clear of the line of group commanders,
  changes direction (if necessary), and halts. The designated squadron forms a column of
  flights 18 paces in the rear of the band with the ceremonial flagbearer in the rear of the
  leading flight.
  7.34.5. The escort then marches without music to the wing (group) commander’s office and
  forms in line facing the entrance.
  7.34.6. The flagbearer of the US flag, preceded by the senior flight commander of the escort
  squadron and followed by a designated NCO of the escort squadron, obtains the US flag.
  7.34.7. The flagbearer of the US flag returns, followed by the flight commanders and the
  NCO. The flagbearer halts before the entrance, facing the escort squadron. The flight
  commander takes a position on the right and the NCO on the left of the flagbearer of the US
  flag. The escort squadron is then brought to present arms, and the band plays the national
  anthem or To The Color. The flight commander and NCO salute on the command of the
  squadron commander.
  7.34.8. At the last note of the music, the squadron commander brings the squadron to order
  arms. The flight commander and NCO end their salutes and return to their posts in the
  squadron. The squadron is formed in column, and the band posts in front of the column. The
  flagbearer takes a position to the center in the rear of the center flight. The escort squadron
  then marches in quick time back to the parade area with the band playing. The squadron
  enters from the right of the airmen and moves parallel to the front of the airmen, arriving at a
  point 24 paces in front of the Commander of Troops.
  7.34.9. When the US flag arrives opposite the center of the wing (group), the escort
  squadron and band are formed in line facing the wing (group). The flagbearer of the US flag,
  passing between the flights, advances and halts six paces in front of the wing (group)
  commander at the post in front of the center of the wing (group).
  7.34.10. Once the flagbearer halts, the wing (group) commander faces about and commands
  Present, ARMS. The commanding officer of the center (or right center) group (squadron)
  commands Present, ARMS.             The other group (squadron) commanders continue
  simultaneously toward both flanks, and the escort squadron commander brings the units to
  present arms. The wing (group) commander then faces to the front and salutes. The band
  plays the national anthem or To The Color, and organizational Air Force flags are dipped in
  salute while the music is played.
AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 109


   7.34.11. The wing (group) commander then faces about and brings the wing (group) to order
   arms. The flagbearer of the US flag moves to the post on the right of the Air Force flag.
   7.34.12. After the escort squadron executes order arms, the squadron faces to the right (on
   command of its commander) and, preceded by the band, marches to its place in line to the
   right of the Colors, passing around the left flank parallel to the rear of the airmen.
   7.34.13. The band plays until the escort squadron passes the left of the line. Then it returns
   to its position on the right, passing in the rear of the wing (group).
   7.34.14. The wing (group) may be given the command REST when the escort squadron
   passes to the left of the line.
7.35. Salutes by Flags.
   7.35.1. The Air Force departmental flag is an organizational flag and is dipped while the
   National Anthem, “To the Color”, musical honors for CSAF or higher or a foreign national
   anthem is played. The departmental flag is also dipped when rendering honors to the SecAF,
   the CSAF, their direct representative or any government official of equivalent or higher
   grade, including foreign dignitaries. Additionally, the departmental flag and other
   subordinate flags will be dipped during military funeral honors. In marching, the Air Force
   flag is dipped in salute when it is approximately six paces from the front of the person
   entitled to the salute. It resumes the carry when it is approximately six paces beyond that
   person (Figure 7.12). (Reference: AFI 34-1201, paragraph 2.22.8.).
   7.35.2. When passing in review, the color guard executes eyes right approximately six paces
   from the reviewing officer on command of the senior flagbearer. All except the person on
   the right flank of the color guard execute eyes right (Figure 7.13).
7.36. Courtesies to the US Flag.
   7.36.1. Flags flown from stationary flagstaffs on bases are saluted only at reveille, retreat,
   and special occasions. Small flags and flags on half-staff are not saluted. Cased and folded
   flags are not saluted.
   7.36.2. Military personnel passing an uncased US flag salute approximately six paces before
   reaching the flag and hold the salute until they have passed approximately six paces beyond
   it. Likewise, when an uncased US flag passes by, military personnel salute approximately six
   paces before the flag is even with them and hold the salute until the flag has passed
   approximately six paces beyond them. If US flags are passing as a part of a flag mass,
   military personnel will render a salute approximately six paces before the arrival of the US
   flags. Military personnel will drop the salute approximately six passes after the US flags
   have passed and will remain at attention until all remaining flags in the mass have passed.
7.37. Saluting When the National Anthem or To The Color is Played.
   7.37.1. The US flag is symbolic of the United States and the principles for which it stands.
   The national anthem is a declaration of reverence and loyalty to the United States with the
   flag as an emblem.
   7.37.2. On certain occasions, such as during inclement weather or when a band is not present
   for a retreat ceremony, To The Color is played instead of the national anthem. To The Color
   is a bugle call sounded as a salute to the flag and it symbolizes respect to the nation and the
 110                                                 AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   flag the same as the national anthem does. The proper courtesies in paragraphs 7.37.2.1
   through 7.37.2.5 must be rendered.
       7.37.2.1. When in uniform in formation, but not a part of a ceremony, the unit
       commander commands present arms when the national anthem or To The Color is
       played. The unit should be faced toward the flag before being given present arms.
       7.37.2.2. When in uniform, but not in formation:

Figure 7.13. Position of Flags and Color Guard at Eyes Right.




          7.37.2.2.1. Outdoors, at any ceremony where the US flag is present, come to
          attention, face the flag in the ceremony, and salute. At sporting events, if the flag is
          visible, face the flag and salute. If the flag is not visible, face the band and salute in
          its direction. If the music is recorded, face the front and salute. At all other outdoor
          occasions, follow the same general principle, come to attention, salute, and face the
          flag, if visible, or the music.
          7.37.2.2.2. Indoors, when the national anthem or To The Color is played, face the
          flag (if present) and assume the position of attention. If no flag is present, assume the
          position of attention facing the music. Do not salute unless under arms.
       7.37.2.3. When in civilian clothing outdoors, members of the Armed Forces and veterans
       who are present, but not in uniform, may render the military salute.
       7.37.2.4. When in civilian clothing indoors, render the civilian salute by standing at
       attention and placing the right hand over the heart.
       7.37.2.5. In vehicles during an Air Force flag ceremony, the driver brings the moving
       vehicle to a stop at the first note of the national anthem or To The Color. Personnel in
       vehicles, including the driver, remain seated at attention.
   7.37.3. Air Force photographers and camera operators render appropriate honors outlined in
   paragraph 7.37.2.2 except when they are specifically assigned to photograph others
   rendering honors.
   7.37.4. Flags and national anthems of friendly foreign countries are shown the same marks
   of respect.
7.38. Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.
   7.38.1. In military formations and ceremonies, the Pledge of Allegiance is not recited.
 112                                                   AFMAN36-2203 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   7.38.2. At protocol functions and social and sporting events that include civilian participants,
   military personnel should:
       7.38.2.1. When in uniform outdoors, stand at attention, remain silent, face the flag, and
       render the hand salute.
       7.38.2.2. When in uniform indoors, stand at attention, remain silent, and face the flag.
       Do not render the hand salute. Where the participants are primarily civilians or in
       civilian attire, reciting the Pledge of Allegiance is optional for those in uniform.
       7.38.2.3. When in civilian attire, recite the Pledge of Allegiance standing at attention,
       facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. Men should remove their headdress
       with the right hand and hold it over their left shoulder, hand over the heart.
7.39. Army, Navy, and Air Force Gun Salutes.
   7.39.1. When gun salutes are fired at Army or Navy installations to honor a living person, all
   individuals in the ceremonial party salute and spectators stand at attention. When gun salutes
   are fired on Independence Day and Memorial Day, all individuals face the flag, if visible, or
   the site of the saluting guns, if the flag is not visible, and salute.
   7.39.2. In the Air Force, gun salutes are not fired during any parade, reveille, or retreat
   ceremony.
7.40. Prevention of Fainting by Persons Participating in Ceremonies. Commanders and
supervisors responsible for the conduct of military ceremonies such as honor guard functions,
parades, and change of command ceremonies will take necessary precautions to minimize
instances of fainting and possible injury to personnel. When preparing for ceremonies, consider
the duration of the event, climatic conditions, and instances where personnel are required to
stand at a fixed position for prolonged periods of time. The following guidelines apply:
   7.40.1. Ensure duration is as short as practical while keeping with the demands of the
   ceremonies.
   7.40.2. Deploy units in time for alignment of personnel and placement of the Colors within
   formation, but without excessive waiting time.
   7.40.3. When appropriate, maintain a position of at ease until the arrival of distinguished
   persons or the senior commander.
   7.40.4. The Commander of Troops should consider maximum use of the positions of parade
   rest or at ease according to the demands of the ceremony and climatic conditions. Airmen
   should be in a position of at ease or parade rest for speeches or lengthy events during the
   ceremony.
   7.40.5. Participants should be instructed that, if they experience symptoms of becoming ill,
   they may leave the formation.
   7.40.6. In preparation for a ceremony, practice sessions should be conducted with the same
   duration and sequence of events that personnel will encounter in the ceremony.
