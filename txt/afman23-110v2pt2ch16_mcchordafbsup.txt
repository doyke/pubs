16.4.1. Inventory. The procedures and responsibilities for reverse-post inputs have been
decentralized to all applicable sections in the LRS. Each section in the LRS is responsible for
initiating and processing reverse-post inputs to correct errors originating from their applicable
area of responsibility.
16.4.2. Repair Cycle Support. The Flight Service Center (62 LRS/LGRMF) will reverse-post
transactions involving Due-in from Maintenance (DIFM) assets with the exception of
warehouse/organizational refusals.
16.4.2.1. (Added) The Receiving Section (62 LRS/LGRMR) will reverse-post transactions
resulting from receipt (REC) and due-out release (DOR) inputs processed during normal duty
hours. Items processed on weekends or after-hours will be the responsibility of the Aircraft Parts
Store (62 LRS/LGRMA). The Aircraft Parts Store will only reverse-post DOR and REC to
correct demand codes on initial issue requests and actions resulting from receipts processed on
weekends or after-hours.
16.4.2.2. (Added) The Aircraft Parts Store or After-Hours Support will reverse-post
transactions resulting from issues and back-orders.
16.4.3. Document Control. The Customer Service Section (62 LRS/LGRMC) is responsible for
identifying reverse-post corrective action found during quality control checks outlined in
Chapter 18. The Customer Service Section also processes reverse-post inputs for errors found
within other areas of the LRS, excluding the Storage Section (62 LRS/LGRMS), the Aircraft
Parts Store, and the Flight Service Center. The section finding the error will assign freeze code
Q and notify the section responsible for the initial input.

decentralized to all applicable sections within the LRS. Only Seven-Level military and civilian
equivalent personnel will be authorized to process reverse-post transactions according to

responsible for reverse-post action to correct quantities, unit of issue, or stock numbers that

be accompanied by 62 LRS, Reverse-Post Form (Attachment 16C-3) available on the LRS
server S:\\Common\Reverse Post Forms\ justification will include: reason why, brief
explanation (i.e., posted twice, wrong quantity, erroneous shipment, etc). Actions taken: list all
actions necessary to correct the error (i.e., reverse-post receipt and process for 6 each, etc).
