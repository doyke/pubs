                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope and Purpose.
     1.1.1. Motor vehicles operating on the airfield are necessary for normal operations and
     maintenance. However, they present a clear danger to aircraft and ground personnel.
     Carelessness, haste, and disregard of existing safety standards by ground vehicle operators
     are inexcusable and are primary sources of aircraft collisions and personnel injury.
NOTE: The term airfield includes runways, all taxiways, aircraft parking ramps/aprons, hot
cargo pad, arm/de-arm areas, hangars along Fire Lane Road, and portions of the perimeter road
(Patrol Road). The terms airfield, flightline and airport operations area are interchangeable.
     1.1.2. The goal of the airfield driving program is to create a safe environment between
     ground vehicle operators, personnel and aircraft in an airport setting. Vehicle movement
     must be held to the absolute minimum consistent with mission requirements. All personnel
     operating a vehicle on Patrick’s airfield must be familiar with local airfield driving
     procedures as outlined in this instruction, and must have a valid AF IMT 483, Certificate of
     Competency, endorsed for airfield driving at Patrick AFB.
     1.1.3. The standards set forth in this instruction are to control vehicles and personnel on the
     airfield. Only trained personnel will be assigned duties which include driving on the airfield.
     Airfield experience (e.g., operating vehicles or aircraft) is not a substitute for completion of
     local airfield driving training and testing requirements. Trained personnel must be
     knowledgeable of all airfield driving rules and comply with this instruction.
     1.1.4. All personnel on the airfield are responsible for monitoring vehicle safety, detecting
     unauthorized vehicles, and immediately reporting driving violations to 45th Operations
     Support Squadron (45 OSS), Airfield Operations Flight (OSA). The Airfield Manager
     (AFM) will investigate all violations and report findings to the 45th Operations Support
     Squadron Commander (45 OSS/CC) with a courtesy copy to the 45th Space Wing Safety
     Office (45 SW/SEF) (investigations must neither delay notification nor interfere with the
     safety investigation). Unit commanders, Airfield Driving Program Managers (ADPM),
     Security Forces (SF), and Airfield Management (AM) have the authority to revoke airfield
     driving privileges.

                                     response is expected.
Read Back                            Repeat my message to me.
Roger                                I have received all of your last transmission.
Stand By                             Means the controller or pilot must pause for
                                     a few seconds, usually to attend to other
                                     duties of a higher priority. Also means to
                                     wait as in "stand by for clearance." The
                                     caller should reestablish contact if a delay is
                                     lengthy.
Unable                               Indicates inability to comply with a specific
                                     instruction, request, or clearance.

Wilco                                I have received your message, understand it,
                                     and will comply with it.
   3.9.5. Do not use the words ―CLEAR,‖ ―CLEARED‖ or ―CLEARANCE‖ when in radio
   communications with the Control Tower. These words are reserved for Air Traffic Control
   (ATC)/pilot takeoff and landing approval only. Exception: Vehicle operators may reply -
   Loud and Clear in response to an ATCT request for radio transmission quality or clarity only.
45SWI13-207V1 19 APRIL 2012                                                                      23


   3.9.6. Observe proper radio discipline at all times. Ensure transmissions are brief, clearly
   spoken, and include only information pertinent to the situation. When inside the CMA,
   operator will monitor all radio communications. Repeat instructions received verbatim to
   validate the approval/disapproval instruction. This is especially important concerning hold
   short instructions and clearances. Do not proceed to the CMA prior to reading back
   instructions.
   3.9.7. If in doubt, ask for a repeat of the transmission. Drivers that exit their vehicles in the
   CMA will carry a hand-held radio at all times.
   3.9.8. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

Table 3.2. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology.
 VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     ―PATRICK TOWER
                                       AIRFIELD ONE”.
 ATCT:                                 ―AIRFIELD ONE, PATRICK
                                       TOWER”.
 VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     ― PATRICK TOWER
                                       AIRFIELD ONE REQUEST TO CROSS
                                       (runway) AT (point/intersection).
 ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, CROSS (runway) AT

                                       (runway)”.
      3.9.8.1. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time
      for correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or
      if you do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
      communications only occur when each party knows and understands what the other is
      saying.

                     OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

4.1. Operating Procedures and Standards:
   4.1.1. Do not use the airfield for convenience. Do not use the airfield as a shortcut when
   there are accessible roads off the airfield.
   4.1.2. Restrict runway crossings to mission essential operations only. No vehicle will cross
   the runway when Rescue Road/South Patrick can be used. Rescue Road/South Patrick is
   designated as the primary means for traffic to gain access to facilities on the north and south
   side of the runway.
   4.1.3. Do not use the airfield for recreational use (e.g., walking or running, etc.).
   4.1.4. Vehicles operating on the airfield will have an airfield diagram and AFVA 11-240,
   USAF Airport Signs and Markings, in the vehicle at all times. Vehicles operating within the
   CMA will also have an AFVA 13-222, Runway/Controlled Movement Area (CMA)
   Procedures, in the vehicle at all times. Units may order decals via AF Portal e-publishing
   website. The decal may be permanently affixed in plain view of the driver, or clipped to the
   inside of the sun visor on the driver's side of the vehicle and flipped down for ready
   reference.
   4.1.5. Aircraft have the right-of-way. Vehicles will never overtake or pass a taxiing/towed
   aircraft.
   4.1.6. With the exception of a Transient Alert "Follow Me" vehicle, do not drive a vehicle
   into the path of a taxiing aircraft. Do not drive a vehicle between a "Follow Me" vehicle and
   an aircraft, a marshaller and an aircraft, or a fire truck and an aircraft when the fire truck has
   its emergency lights on.
   4.1.7. See Attachment 13, Detailed Airfield Map for the location of visual blind spots that
   ATCT cannot see. Vehicles in these areas will use increased vigilance in these areas to
   remain clear of taxiing/towing aircraft.
   4.1.8. Do not drive vehicles within 50-feet of fueling/defueling operations unless specifically
   authorized by a directive. Do not drive or tow vehicle/equipment over fuel pit lids located on
   parking aprons.
   4.1.9. Do not smoke on aircraft parking ramps, taxiways, runways, or airfield access roads.
   Smoking may be permitted in designated areas near buildings and hangars on the flightline.
4.2. Escort Procedures:
   4.2.1. All personnel operating on the airfield environment must receive training, a briefing,
   or be escorted prior to entering the airfield. Base assigned military, DoD, and permanent
   (annual) contractors must complete the Airfield Driving CBT, be licensed or certified to
   operate a private/government/contractor owned vehicle and have AF IMT 483, Certificate of
   Competency, endorsed for driving on Patrick AFB.
45SWI13-207V1 19 APRIL 2012                                                                    27


   4.2.2. Airfield management does not provide escorts for personnel requiring access to the
   airfield. If escorts are required, the agency sponsoring the individual or event is required to
   provide qualified escorts. The owning agency must maintain positive control of all
   contractors working on or near the airfield at all times.
   4.2.3. Personnel acting as escorts must be authorized and certified to drive on the airfield
   and be fully aware of associated responsibilities. Escorts must brief all drivers on route,
   speed, and procedures.
   4.2.4. The number of vehicles being escorted must be limited to the minimum required to
   accomplish the mission. Vehicles must maintain close intervals when crossing or operating
   in the CMA. The escort will be in the lead and is responsible for all communications with
   ATCT personnel.
4.3. Airfield Diagram:
   4.3.1. The Wing ADPM will provide an airfield diagram (Attachment 10) to all ADPMs for
   airfield familiarization training. Airfield diagram training shall include the following items:
       4.3.1.1. The CMA for vehicles/pedestrians as defined in this instruction.
       4.3.1.2. The location and description of Visual Flight Rules (VFR) holding position
       markings.
       4.3.1.3. Airfield access points.
       4.3.1.4. Restricted Area boundaries/ECPs.
       4.3.1.5. The Controlled Area boundary.
       4.3.1.6. Vehicle traffic lanes and traffic flow.
       4.3.1.7. Critical area boundaries for precision navigational aids.
       4.3.1.8. A legend to illustrate symbols used.
4.4. CMA Access:
   4.4.1. The CMA encompasses active runways, overruns, the area within 100 feet laterally
   from the edge of the runway and any other areas designated in the base ADI.
       4.4.1.1. Access to the CMA is limited to mission essential operations only.
Note: When crossing a runway is required during flying operations, the preferred crossing point
will be the departure end.
       4.4.1.2. Patrick AFB CMA includes the following:
           4.4.1.2.1. Runways 02/20 and 11/29.
           4.4.1.2.2. Runway Overruns.
           4.4.1.2.3. Taxiways Bravo (south of Runway 11/29), Charlie (west of taxiway Bravo)
           and Golf.
           4.4.1.2.4. All areas within 100 feet of the overruns, runways and taxiways (within the
           CMA) including the infield areas between Runway 02/20 and Taxiway Bravo (south
           of Runway 11/29).
 28                                                           45SWI13-207V1 19 APRIL 2012


Note: Closed runways and overruns are considered part of the CMA. For special events and as
appropriate, AM may authorize controlled movements areas to be temporarily uncontrolled.
   4.4.2. No vehicle/person may enter the CMA without specific approval from ATCT.
       4.4.2.1. ATCT has authority over all traffic entering the CMA, and will issue specific
       instructions to control movement of aircraft, vehicles, equipment or personnel.
       4.4.2.2. Establish radio contact with ATCT before gaining access to crossing or working
       in the CMA. Once the ATCT approves access, maintain radio contact while in the CMA.
       Always monitor appropriate radio frequency while on the airfield. Note: ATCT will not
       issue or use unconditional instructions (blanket approval) when authorizing vehicles to
       enter the runway.
       4.4.2.3. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians operating on the CMA must use a distinct call
       sign (e.g., Airfield 1, Chief 1, Sweeper 1, TA 1, etc.) coordinated by the Wing ADPM to
       avoid duplicating, confusing, or different agencies using similar names (e.g.Airfield 1,
       Airfield Lighting, Airfield Sweeper, etc.). Note: Do not use a call sign that is also a part
       of ATC phraseology such as ―Taxi 1. (See Attachment 8, Patrick Approved Vehicle
       Callsign).
       4.4.2.4. For standardization, AM personnel will use the radio call signs listed below.
          4.4.2.4.1. Airfield Manager (Airfield – 1).
          4.4.2.4.2. Deputy/Assistant Airfield Manager (Airfield – 2).
          4.4.2.4.3. NCOIC, Airfield Management, NCOIC, Airfield Management Operations,
          NCOIC, Airfield Management Training and Airfield Management Operations
          Personnel or civilian equivalents (Airfield 3, 4, 5, etc.).
       4.4.2.4.4. Vehicles operating within the CMA will have an AFVA 13-222 (Figure 4.1),
       AFVA 11-240 (Figure 4.2.), and a local airfield map in the vehicle at all times. The
       decal may be permanently affixed in plain view of the driver, or clipped to the inside of
       the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle and flipped down for ready reference.
45SWI13-207V1 19 APRIL 2012                                                             29


Figure 4.1. AFVA 13-222, Runway/Controlled Movement Area Procedures.




Figure 4.2. AFVA 11-240, USAF Airport Signs and Markings.




Note: APDM’s may order AFVA 11-240 on e-Publishing website
http://www/epublishing.af.mil.
      4.4.2.5. Vehicles will use a Light Emitting Diode (LED)/rotating beacon or emergency
      warning flashers while operating in the CMA.
      4.4.2.6. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent radio
      mounted in the vehicle to communicate with the ATCT. Use a handheld radio only as a
      backup or when communication is required outside the vehicle. Note: Conduct an
      operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
      4.4.2.7. Words that authorize access to CMA are ―PROCEED‖ and ―CROSS.‖ The word
      ―HOLD‖ indicates disapproval of an operator’s request. Drivers will never use
      “CLEAR.‖ The proper term for leaving the CMA is ―OUT OF‖ and ―OFF‖ for exiting
      the runway (See Table 3.2-3.5 for examples).
 30                                                          45SWI13-207V1 19 APRIL 2012


      4.4.2.8. The ATCT is normally manned Sunday-Sunday 0800L-0000L. The airfield and
      ATCT does on certain occasions stay open after published hours so it is imperative that
      drivers attempt to contact ATCT on the radio prior to proceeding on any portion of the
      CMA.
      4.4.2.9. During the times the ATCT and AM is closed, 45 SW/CP is the monitoring
      agency for the CMA.
          4.4.2.9.1. Agencies that need to be on the airfield during airfield closure times will
          have to pre-coordinate with AM. AM will notify 45 SW/CP of what agency will be
          utilizing the airfield during closed hours.
          4.4.2.9.2. Agencies will advise 45 SW/CP when entering and exiting the runway.
          4.4.2.9.3. The 45 SW/CP will notify AM who is on the airfield when AM opens.
          Note: 45 SW/CP is only a monitoring agency only and does not provide positive
          control of vehicles on the airfield/runway.
      4.4.2.10. When the airfield opens the ATCT will broadcast that the field is open and all
      vehicles operating on or near the CMA contact tower.
4.5. Disabled Vehicles/Radio Failure:
   4.5.1. When a vehicle has a malfunction that prevents operation under its own power, use
   every means to alert taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. At a minimum, the ground vehicle
   operator will:
      4.5.1.1. Switch the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers on.
      4.5.1.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission:
      “All Parties BREAK, BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield

Host Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately—Used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent
situation.

drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
Perimeter Road—A road around the runway perimeter designed to connect the access roads.
Precision Obstacle Free Zone—An 800 foot wide by 200 foot long area centered on the runway
centerline adjacent to the threshold designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from
ground vehicles and other aircraft when ceiling is less than 250 feet or visibility is less than 3/4
statute mile (or runway visual range below 4,000 feet.)
Privately Owned Vehicle (POVs)—A vehicle that is owned or leased by a private party.
Proceed—Authorization to begin/continue on approved routes.
Ramp—Either concrete or asphalt (depending on the weight of the aircraft and the sub-base of

off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:
1) Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC instructions,
AFIs and/or FARs.
3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation(V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled movement
area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been
authorized by Air Traffic Control.
Say Again—Used to request a repeat of the last transmission. Usually specifies transmission was
not understood or received.
Stand By—To pause while other duties of a higher priority are attended to. Also means to
standby for clearance/approval.
Taxilane—Ramp space between rows of parked aircraft used to maneuver aircraft to and from
parking spots and taxiways.
Taxiway—A paved surface for taxiing aircraft from parking ramp to runway.
