                                                Chapter 1

                                     GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. Organizational commanders are responsible for the care , custody, and pr otection of the
facilities they occupy. As primary and alternate building managers, you are the commander's representa-
tive and the Base Civil Engineer's (BCE) official contact whenever your building needs civil engineering
(CE) work. This pamphlet provides guidance and information on your duti es and responsibilities. It is
designed to make your job easier.

1.2. Assigning RPBMs. The organizational commander designates the primary and alternate building
manager for each facility by letter. The letter must have the commander's signature and should include the
appointed manager's full name, office symbol, duty and home phone numbers. Upon completion, the let-
ter will be sent to the real prope rty assistant at 88 ABW/CEMR. If there are any changes of personnel
because of PCS, retirement, change of duty station, or separation, a letter showing these changes must be
provided to CEMR 10 days prior to the change.

1.3. Philosophy. CE is primarily a service or ganization. We support the mission by providing you, our
customer, with quality places to wo rk and live. The building manager program supports the mission by
stressing proper facility maintenance, repair, and upkeep. It relies on using the building manager as a sin-
gle point of contact to identify, coordinate, and prioritize your building needs.

1.4. Assignment. Building managers serve as the custodians for the space the or ganization occupies. In
multipurpose facilities, the major user is usually a ssigned as the primary building manager . Any othe r
organization using a portion of a mu ltipurpose building is encouraged to appoint an alternate building
manager for the area occupi ed. The building manager calls in dir ect scheduled work (DSW), previously
referred to as job orders, and revi ews and coordinates on AF IMT 332, Base Civil Engineer Work
Request, then follows up on the status of the requested work.

1.5. Procedures. How to process/submit each of the following will be explained in Chapter 2 - emer-
gency, urgent and routine DSW; self-help projects; maintenance and repair work; and minor construction.

1.6. Responsibilities. The primary or alternate RPBM, with the help of all oc cupants and use rs of a
building, is responsible for the care, custody and protection of the ass igned real property (interior and
exterior) from damage or loss. The RPBM will set up a schedul e for inspecting and policing the grounds
within 50 feet of the building.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBPAM32-2 15 APRIL 2005                                                                     5


                                                 Chapter 2

                                        REQUESTS FOR WORK

2.1. Emergency Work. Report all emergencies to the Customer Service Uni t (CSU), extension 73131.
CE maintains a 24-hour a day, 7-day a week capability to respond to emergency conditions. Emergency
work is defined as that which is detrimental to the mission or which reduces operational effectiveness. CE
will respond as soon as possible, normally within 24 hours. Some examples include no heat or air condi-
tioning to a temperature controlled environment, environmental control defects, security alarm failures,
tire hazards, any potential danger to life or property, clogged plumbing, power failure, broken pipes, or a
smoking ballast in a light fixture. In any case, if you are in doubt, callService Call to determine the proper
response.
   2.1.1. Describe the problem, give the specific location, and what has been done to minimize damage
   or loss of real property. The Service Call representative will give you a DSW order number. Any per-
   son can call in an emer gency, but the DSW order number must be provided to the building manager
   for use in managing facility work and obtaining status.
   2.1.2. After duty hours and weekends, ONLY EMERGENCIES are to be reported to Service Call.

2.2. Urgent and Routine DSWs. Work needed to restore your building to best serve your needs is clas-
sified as maintenance and repair. For urgent DSW’s, it may take up to 7 calendardays to be accomplished.
Routine DSWs might take approximately 30 working days and if materials need to be ordered, it may take
longer. Some typical examples include repainting, replacing ceiling tiles, light fixtures or repairs to minor
leaks. You can usually identify this work by conducting periodic inspections of your building and talking
to the users. Submit these requirements to CSU (88 ABW/ CEMR) as follows:
   2.2.1. Prepare an AF IMT 332 (compute rized forms can be ut ilized), with an original and 3 copies,
   listing each item of work on the form. Send th e form to 88 ABW/CEMR. They will assign a work
   request number on it and the custom er copy will be returned to y ou for your record s. A sample AF
   IMT 332 is shown in Attachment 1.
   2.2.2. CSU, extension 73131, may choose to accept some routine maintenance and repair require-
   ments by telephone. We do, however, strongly recommend that if yo u have known routine require-
   ments, you use the AF IMT 332 to identify these requirements.

2.3. Minor Construction. If you have a requirement to add, change, or a lter your building, you must
submit an AF IMT 332 to CSU. Mi nor construction needs detailed planning, capitalization of real prop-
erty records, collection of reimbursements, and gathering data for review or analysis. Unlike maintenance
and repair, minor construction mus t compete with ot her base requirements for use of limited resources.
Your justification of need and when the work should be done will have a direct bearing on whether or not
the request is approved. The stronge r the justification, the better your chances are for approval. If your
organization has the funds to accomp lish the project, put the fund cite number in block 10 and mark the
funds block. This will greatly enhance the chance of the work being accomplished.
   2.3.1. Work Order. AF IMT 332 is received in the CSU, assigned a work order number and for-
   warded to the appropriate shop manager to determine if the job can be accomplished in-house through
   minor construction or maintenance and repair . If it's decided the shop can accomplish, the request is
6                                             WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBPAM32-2 15 APRIL 2005


    forwarded through the process. If they decide th e zones can not accomplish the work, the request is
    sent to Engineering for contract consideration.
    2.3.2. Contract. When extensive work requirements/ special skills are needed, engineering assigns a
    program manager. There are 19 program manage rs assigned to the engineering function located in
    building 11. Each program manager is responsible for tracking contract projects to be accomplished in
    their respective areas. For example, Wright Field has their own program managers. Customers need-
    ing information about proposed or ongoing contract projects should contact their respective program
    manager. Engineering then determines the method of contract necessary to accomplish work. If under
    $200,000 SABER can accomplish. If ur gent, time and materials contracts can accomplish. If there is
    an extensive design, then a firm fixed or requirements contract is applicable.
    2.3.3. Self-Help. Because of limite d resources and/or higher priority work, some of your requests
    cannot be completed by CE work force. As an alternative, you might elect to furnish people and funds,
    and do the work yourself. CE will provide supervision, technical assistance, and limited support if you
    elect to do a self-help project. Requests for Self-help are processed in the same manner as new work,
    i.e., submit an AF IMT 332 to requirements. Customer Service Section at extension 73131.
    DO NOT START SELF-HELP WORK WITHOUT AN APPROVED WORK AUTHORIZA-
    TION.

2.4. Written Requests for Work. Written requests for work are prepared on AF IMT 332 and submitted
to CSU. The AF IMT 332 comes in a set of four sheets with directions for preparation on the back of the
last page. When CSU receives the work request, it is given a work request number and the customer copy
returned to the RPBM. Keep this copy for your records.
    2.4.1. When to use the AF IMT 332.
       2.4.1.1. Minor construction work.

       the fire, safety, or security write-up.
    2.4.2. After the RPBM reviews a nd coordinates on the AF IMT 332 , the organizational commander
    or designated representative, signs, block 13. Without proper coordination and signatures, the AF IMT
    332 will be returned.

2.5. Methods of Initiating Work Requests. The following is a summar y of how to submit work
requests:


Type of Work                        Method                               Method

2.6. Work Completion. How quickly your work is completed depends upon many factors. Some include
complexity of the job, availability of resources, work priority, scope of the work, use of in-service or con-
tract personnel, and emergency or routine status. Keep in touch with CSU, they can provide you with the
current status of your work request. Remember, if you can do the work, self-help may satisfy your needs
much quicker. Give CE time to plan the job and order the materials. If po ssible, submit AF IMT 332 at
least 5-6 months in advance of the date the work order needs to be done.

2.7. Record Keeping. Although there are no formal record keep ing requirements for the building man-
ager, Attachment 3 is sample format you may want to use to make your job and follow-up easier.

                                                Chapter 3

                                      ENERGY MANAGEMENT

3.1. Purpose. In addition to being a regulatory requirement, energy conservation just makes good sense.
The more money we can save in base utility costs, the more will be available to take care of your other
needs. By maintaining proper maintenance of HVAC systems, heating and air conditioning systems, win-
dows, doors; you, the RPBM can assure an energy savings of 20-50 percent of operating costs. This chap-
ter provides guidance on how you can help conserve energy.

3.2. Energy Management. The following tips will help you prom ote a positive attitude toward ener gy
management in your building.
    3.2.1. Make sure thermostats are set at the correct energy conservation temperature during the heating
    and cooling seasons. Use of individual fans or heaters is prohibited unless approved by 88 ABW/
    CEM, approval is granted for medical and short- term system failures only. Common sense practices
    of keeping vents cleane d and unobstructed, and keeping windows and doors shut will allow the sys-
    tems to operate at maximum efficiency.
    3.2.2. Opening blinds and drapes on the sunny side and keeping them closed on the shady side of the
    building during the winter months and vice vers a during the summer will help. Unoccupied rooms
    should be kept closed and the temperature reduced.
    3.2.3. Turn off lights that are not needed--during duty and after du ty hours. Use ener gy conserving
    bulbs.
    3.2.4. Turn off outside lights during daylight hours.
    3.2.5. Check plumbing fixtures for leaks, report leaks to CSU. The temperature of domestic hot water
    should not exceed 95°F.
    3.2.6. Turn off equipment in th e building during e xtended periods of nonus e and a fter duty hours
    unless the equipment must remain on for technical or practical reasons.
    3.2.7. Periodically walk through your building to make sure energy management is being practiced as
    indicated above.
    3.2.8. The Air Force standard winter thermostat setting in offices and administrative buildings is 78°F
    during duty hours and 55°F during of f-duty hours. Thermostats in shops, warehouses, and industrial
    facilities should be set at 55°F to 60°F depending on facility occupancy and mission requirements.
    3.2.9. The Air Force standard summer thermostat setting is 78°F , except for computer centers and
    hospitals, which should be set according to their mission requirements. Ther mostats should re set at
    night and on weekends to a minimum setting of 80°F.
    3.2.10. If the air handling system has an economizer, check to make sure the vanes are not stuck either
    open or closed.
    3.2.11. Notify CSU when you need help in correcting a wasteful energy condition.

3.3. Summary. You are the person with the most direct influence on mee ting energy reduction goals.
Your actions can save thousands of scarce dollars for use on needed facility improvements, You can make

                                        BUILDING SECURITY

6.1. General. The building manager is responsible for build ing security. You should impress upon all
personnel the impor tance of buildin g security. Without their cooperation, your job as building manage r
will be much more difficult. Your name, work and home telephone, and work address are taken from the
letter designating appointment and pr inted on a list for distribution to the security police and lock shop
personnel. Remember regardless of who is responsible for the break in building security, you are the one
who has to correct it.

6.2. Procedures. You should establish procedures to ensure your building is secure from illegal entry at
all times. Double check all doors and windows when closing up and be sure all locks are in good working
order. Report any problem with lock s to CSU. Security police conduc t regular security checks on base
facilities. If your building is not secure, you will need to immediately lock your open doors or windows.
Additionally, security police are required to forward an incident/complaint report to your unit commander
for action. If you have any questions concerning build ing security, contact the resources protection sec-
tion, or law enforcement desk.

6.3. Key Control. An important part of your building security program involves the issuance of keys and
key control. You should ensure ke ys are not duplicated without your personal knowledge or written
approval. However, you are not responsible for keys that control specialized areas in your building. These
are the areas that are used to safeguard specialized equipment, sensitive documents, personal tool kits, etc.
   6.3.1. Recommend that you repossess all keys from personnel going on apermanent change of station
   (PCS), who are being discharged, or who terminate employment. Consider holding keys for safekeep-
   ing for personnel going on extended leave or temporary duty over 30 days.
   6.3.2. When vacating a building or assigned space within a building, be sure to return the appropriate
   keys to the BCE lockshop.
   6.3.3. Sugges t that you record all actions involv ing key control, on a ke y control log as show n in
   Attachment 4. RPBMs will maintain keys issued on AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt,
   Attachment 5. They will also maintain a list of each lock, number of keys existing for each lock, and
   the name of each individual to whom these keys are assigned.

6.4. Accountability. Individuals are responsible for assigned keys. There usually is a charge for replace-
ment keys. Contact CSU to determine the procedures for key replacement.
   6.4.1. Requests for new locks or changes of locks should made on AF IMT 332 with the coordination
   of the RPBM. Lock shop will only recognize build ing managers (whose names appear on the list as
   authorized to receive keys.) Master keys will be issued to the building manager when your building
   lock system is re-keyed or if the lock s are replaced. Requests for master keys require concurrence of
   your unit commander and approval by the BCE.
   6.4.2. The lock shop will prov ide additional keys by using DD Form 1150, Request for Issue or
   Turn-In (Attachment 6) and submit to CSU in building 22, area C.
   6.4.3. Report lost or misplaced keys to your security officer or security police immediately.

7.1. Responsibilities:
   7.1.1. The RP BM will advise 88 ABW/ CEMR of any changes, whether an i ncrease or decrease of
   required custodial service to the facility. You also serve as the focal point for customer complaints. If
   required, you must submit a Cust omer Complaint Record to the quality as surance evaluator (QAE).
   Copies of the Customer Complaint Record can be obtained from the QAE. After validation, this doc-
   umentation is supporting evidence of unsatisfactory performan ce. Each RPBM should have an
   up-to-date folder on the building with a copy of Section C-5 (S tatement of Work in Custodial Con-
   tract) tasks and frequencies charts , building data sh eets, and completion time from each contractor.
   You will receive, or already have a written copy of specific contract requirements from the QAE. This
   information is your guideline as to the service expected from the contractors.
   7.1.2. When a facility is vacated for disposal or for any other reason, the RPBM is responsible for the
   orderliness and cleanliness of the facility after it is emptied. This responsibility formally ends when
   the property is officially released by the 88 ABW/CEC.
   7.1.3. Questions on custodial s ervices should be directed to 88ABW/CETF at extension 76575/
   74885. The WPAFB Custodial Service office is located in building 22, area C.

                                          GROUND SAFETY

10.1. Purpose. Identify potential or existing hazards and initiate corrective actions to protect all person-
nel, property, and equipment.
   10.1.1. Responsibilities: The RPBM should conduct monthly inspections of their area of responsibil-
   ity (interior and exterior), including all common ar eas, such as hallways, entryways, janitor closets,
   mechanical rooms, etc., to which they have access.
   10.1.2. Should the RPBM become aware of an unsafe condition (by whatever mean s, i.e., monthly
   inspection, individual notification, Supervisor Safety Surveillance, or Ground Safety Of fice inspec-
   tions) corrective action must be initiated. Often times in-house corrective measures can abate the haz-
   ard and eliminate the need for further action.
   10.1.3. In the case of an imminen t danger situation, a call to th e 88 CE Service Call Desk (73131)
   may result in prompt corrective action or interim control measures until a permanent fix is obtained.
   In his instance, the Safety Office must also be notified and advised on the situation.
   10.1.4. For unsafe conditions not representing imminent danger an AF IMT 332 should be completed
   and coordinated through ASC Ground Safety Office for assignment of a risk assessment code (RAC).
   A RAC is assigned to hazardous conditions to help CE property schedule priorities. RACs range from
   I to 5, with 1 being the most serious, and 5 being negligible risk.
   10.1.5. Should a hazard be assigned a RAC 1, 2, or 3, an AF IMT 1 118, Notice of Hazard, will be
   completed by the Safety Of fice and forwarded to th e RPBM as applicable. (I n some instances it will
   be the supervisor's r esponsibility to post the hazard.) RACs 1, 2 and 3 are entered into the Safety
   Office Automated Hazard Abatement System where they are updated monthly until closeout.
   10.1.6. RPBMs must monitor the status of all work requests and provide status reports, upon request,
   to commanders, functional managers, supervisors, or the Safety Office.
   10.1.7. RPBMs should obtain and k eep on hand, certain items of equipment to immediately abate
   hazards. Examples: Safety cones to mark the locati on of a hazard; caution tape to rope off and effec-
   tively isolate an unsafe area; and adhesive caution tape to highlight the area hazard.
   10.1.8. During the winter , RPBMs should monitor custodial se rvices, to ensure clear exterior walk-
   ways and entrances per contractual agreement, and that an adequate supply of salt is on hand for
   interim application.
   10.1.9. Direct questions concerning the Ground Safety Program, to ASC/SEG at extension 54212.
