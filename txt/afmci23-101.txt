This instruction implements DOD 4140.1-R, DODI 5000.2, AF Supplement to DODI 5000.2 and AFPD
23-1. It provides guidance for acquiring initial support of USAF aerospace equipment. It applies to provi-
sioning activities and provisioning support activities at the Air Logistics Centers (ALCs), Product Cen-
ters, HQ AFMC/LGIS (OL) and the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS). These instructions do
not apply to US Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard units or members.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This instruction provides for the use of AFMC Form 918, Non-Provisioning Item Supply Support
Request (SSR) Data, when accomplishing non-provisioning SSRs. It also updates procedures by imple-
menting MIL-Standards/Specifications and Acquisition Reform changes. Most of the latter changes are
of the pen and ink type. This instruction also incorporates the Air Force Initial Provisioning Performance
Specification (IPPS), 1 August 1997, and eliminates the outdated Air Force Addendum to Logistics Sup-
port Analysis Record (LSAR) Data Requirements, DD Form 1949-3, 1 January 1994. The IPPS provides
guidance and initiatives of Acquisition Reform by eliminating duplicate and unnecessary language.

                                                Chapter 1
                                              PRINCIPLES

1.1. General. Provisioning is the management process for determining and acquiring the range and quan-
tity of support items necessary to operate and maintain an end item of materiel for an initial period of ser-
vice. The goal of this process is to have the support items available in time to meet/accommodate the
operational need date (OND). Provisioning is a team effort and requires the active participation of person-
nel in the acquisition office, the provisioning office, the contractor and the using command. Close coop-
eration among these activities is essential to insure timely support is achieved. Support items are items
subordinate to, or associated with, an end item (i.e., spares, tools, test equipment and sundry materials)
and required to operate, service, repair or overhaul an end item. The acquisition of spares must be inte-
grated with other elements such as support equipment (SE), technical manuals, training and facilities.
Successful provisioning depends on early planning to develop cost effective logistics support and attain
maximum readiness.

1.2. Objectives:
   1.2.1. The main objective of provisioning is to assure the timely availability of initial stocks of spares
   at all levels of supply and maintenance. These initial stocks are intended to support the end item
   through the program forecast period AFMCI 23-106, Initial Requirements Determination, at the least
   cost to the government until normal replenishment can be effected.
   1.2.2. Every attempt should be made to procure initial spares at fair and reasonable prices. This may
   include procuring initial spares from the actual manufacturer, when cost effective and practical, and
   combining initial spares orders with other requirements through the use of the spares acquisition inte-
   grated with production (SAIP) technique.
   1.2.3. The Air Force should seek to maximize use of items already in the Department of Defense
   (DOD) inventory in order to minimize the proliferation and use of nonstandard items.
   1.2.4. The Air Force should limit its acquisition of data to the minimum amount necessary to support
   the process. Every attempt should be made to combine data requirements with other logistics require-
   ments.

1.3. Basic Provisioning Concepts:
   1.3.1. Plans for provisioning will be developed as soon as the end item of materiel is conceived.
   1.3.2. The necessary acquisition documents will be prepared for obtaining provisioning technical
   data and supplemental data for provisioning required for acquisition and modification programs. This
   includes drafting the statement of work/statement of objectives (SOW/SOO), identification and tailor-
   ing of data item descriptions, and preparing the contract data requirements list for input to the request
   for proposal. Coordinate this action with the engineering function regarding supplemental data for
   provisioning (SDFP). Contract for the minimum essential data item descriptions (DIDs) which satisfy
   the specific acquisition and provide the most effective initial support by the OND. SDFP, in support
   of commercial items, will be limited to that available to the vendors commercial customers.

     1.3.3. Verify the contract contains the appropriate tasking and federal acquisition regulation clause
     52.227-14 or DOD Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) supplement clause 252.227-7013 regarding
     rights in data.
     1.3.4. Notify all involved activities of scheduled guidance and provisioning conferences. Prepare and
     forward detailed minutes to all activities for each conference.

                                    PROVISIONING PLANNING

2.1. General. A provisioning strategy will be developed on all new acquisition programs and on major
modification programs. The strategy will be formulated at program initiation and finalized prior to the
beginning of the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase and documented in the inte-
grated logistics support plan (ILSP).

2.2. Planning Factors: Essential factors to be considered include:
   2.2.1. Maintenance concept.
   2.2.2. Reliability and Maintainability (R&M) factors.
   2.2.3. Program business strategy.

2.3. Provisioning Techniques. Techniques that will be considered to insure spares are available by the
operational need date at a reasonable cost include:
   2.3.1. Interim release. This will allows the contractor to begin work on spares with a long production
   or procurement lead time prior to receipt of a provisioned item order (PIO).
   2.3.2. Spares Acquisition Integrated with Production (SAIP). This incorporates Air Force orders for
   spares and recoverable assemblies with the contractor's orders for production installs (DODI 5000.2)
   to maximize quantity buys thereby reducing cost. The decision to use or not use the SAIP technique
   must be documented in the ILSP and in provisioning guidance conference minutes.
   2.3.3. Breakout of initial spares. The objective of this technique is to reduce cost by procuring initial
   spares directly from the actual manufacturer.
   2.3.4. Accelerated Provisioning Concept (APC). This technique may be used to shorten the provi-
   sioning time. PIO and funding tasks normally done after the provisioning conference are completed
   during the provisioning conference.
   2.3.5. Provisioning Methods.
       2.3.5.1. Provisioning conference. This is the normal method for accomplishing data verification
       for larger systems. The conference may be held at the contractor's facility. The in-house or depot
       committee provisioning conference, held at the ALC, is preferred for smaller systems.
       2.3.5.2. Resident Provisioning Team (RPT) or Resident Integrated Logistics Support Activity
       (RILSA). This method which employs an Air Force provisioning team permanently assigned to
       the contractor's facility may be used for major system acquisitions to expedite the processing of a
       large work load and reduce TDY costs.
   2.3.6. Additional Considerations:
       2.3.6.1. Budgeting and Funding. Early planning for the availability of funds to purchase spares,
       provisioning data, etc., is critical. Most initial spares requirements were stock funded beginning in
       FY 94 as directed by DMRD 904. Initial spares excluded from stock funding are fully delineated
       in the Jan 93 DMRD 904 Implementation Plan, and include spare engines and classified depot
       level reparables. Central procurement initial spares funds,e.g., Budget Programs (BP) 16, 26 and
12                                                                                         30 APRIL 1999

        BPs 82, 83 and 84, will reimburse the Reparable Support Division (RSD) of the stock fund for
        acquisition costs incurred. (NOTE: In FY 95, initial spares funding in BPs 82, 83 and 84 will be
        consolidated in BP 84; in FY 96 initial spares for these BPs will all be funded in new BP 86.) It is
        the responsibility of the Single Manager to ensure that adequate amounts of both stock fund obli-
        gation authority and central procurement funds are requested/budgeted lead time away from need.
        2.3.6.2. Scheduling of Provisioning Events. Provisioning events will begin depending on the
        design stability of the item and/or interfacing items being provisioned. Provisioning will begin
        after the physical configuration audit on acquisition category (ACAT) I and II acquisitions or
        modification programs which have a high degree of instability. For all other acquisition or modi-
        fication programs provisioning will begin after critical design review.
        2.3.6.3. Defense Logistics Service Center (DLSC) screening will be accomplished in-house
        mechanically through the AFMC Provisioning System along with the Cataloging and Standardiza-
        tion Center Provisioning System.
        2.3.6.4. Deferred Procurement. During the initial support period, Provisioning Activities may
        defer procurement of partial quantities of computed requirements for selected support items when
        operating program uncertainties or other special circumstances make such risks acceptable in the
        context of available resources and readiness goals.
        2.3.6.5. Warranty considerations. Warranties will impact the timing and/or extent of provision-
        ing. If a warranty applies to the end item or major components, provisioning may be delayed until
        the end of the warranty period only if all pipeline spares and condemnations are also to be pro-
        vided by the contractor.
        2.3.6.6. Interservice considerations. In joint service/agency acquisitions, Air Force provisioning
        strategy, planning and contracting must be coordinated with those of the other services/agencies.
        2.3.6.7. Foreign Military Sale (FMS) considerations. For programs which include or consist of
        acquisition for FMS customers, the considerations of the FMS customers must be included in the
        strategy, planning and contracting.

2.4. Implementation:
     2.4.1. Plans. Overall spares support planning, of which provisioning strategy and schedules are a
     part, will be documented by the Chief of Logistics/Integrated Logistics Support Manager (ILSM),
     with the assistance of the System Support Manager (SSM) ALC, in the ILSP, acquisition plan and the
     overall program business strategy plan.
     2.4.2. Contracting. Critical for implementation of the provisioning strategy is contracting for the
     right data to support provisioning and spares requirements. Whenever possible, provisioning require-
     ments are to be included in the EMD or production contract, a separate spares contract or a combina-
     tion of the above. Contractual considerations are required during all program phases. They include:
        2.4.2.1. Program Initiation. The implementing organization, whether a Single Manager or another
        AFMC activity, should notify its supporting activities (including those responsible for provision-
        ing) of new system/end article requirements as early as possible during development of the acqui-
        sition plan. This allows the supporting activities to determine and forward provisioning
        requirements to the implementing organization.
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                         13

    2.4.2.2. Integration. All provisioning requirements will be constructed to comply with the overall
    acquisition strategy. They will also be integrated with other integrated logistics elements of the
    program such as engineering, manufacturing, quality, configuration management, test and evalua-
    tion, and technical orders. Use of a separate spares contract will require linkage clauses to assure
    integration with the contractual language in the associated EMD or production contract. Inclusion
    of provisioning requirements in the EMD contract will require inclusion with the production con-
    tract.
        2.4.2.2.1. All essential provisioning requirements (funded SAIP, interim release and provi-
        sioning DIDs) in support of the provisioning strategy will be specified in the appropriate part
        of the EMD request for proposal (RFP), statement of work/statement of objectives (SOW/
        SOO) or contract data requirements list (CDRL) . This should be done to identify the data to
        be developed during the EMD for later delivery in the EMD or production phase. When provi-
        sioning requirements cannot be put on an EMD contract, they will be considered prior to the
        production contract and included in the production contract or a separate spares contract. The
        data authorized for acquisition from the contractor by the Air Force are prescribed in DOD
        5010.12-L.
        2.4.2.2.2. The Initial Provisioning Performance Specification (IPPS) and provisioning perfor-
        mance schedule must be incorporated into the RFP for the EMD contract, negotiated and
        incorporated in the production contract. In addition, the Air Force will furnish the contractor a
        programming checklist containing sufficient programming data to enable the contractor to
        forecast initial support requirements.
        2.4.2.2.3. Preproposal conference. These conferences are held to ensure bidders understand
        contract requirements. The contractor will be provided information on specific Air Force pro-
        visioning documentation, data submittal media, SAIP, interim release and long lead items list
        (LLIL) concepts, etc., to permit them to develop realistic responses to the RFP.
        2.4.2.2.4. Source selection. During source selection, contractor proposals will be evaluated to
        assure provisioning is adequately addressed.

   DATA CALL AND PURCHASE REQUEST (PR)/MILITARY INTERDEPARTMENTAL
                      PURCHASE REQUEST (MIPR)

3.1. General. Air Force policy is to buy only the minimum essential contractor-prepared PTD/SDFP.
Determination of this data is based on the complexity of the system/end articles and on whether or not
they are initial or follow-on requirements.

3.2. Data Call:
   3.2.1. A contractor data call is issued by Data Management to identify and record on a DD Form
   1423, Contract Data Requirements List, the data requirements necessary to develop support for a
   system/end article to be acquired.
   3.2.2. Information contained in the application/interrelationship block, block 7, of the DD Form
   1664, Data Item Description (DID), provides a basis for selecting appropriate data items. Use the
   latest DID, published in the acquisition management systems and data requirements control list
   (AMSDL), DOD 5010.12-L. If the acquisition is a follow-on, use the DIDs applied to the original
   contract.
   3.2.3. When furnishing requirements for a data call, indicate on the CDRL, use the DID number
   shown on the DD Form 1664. The use of only a portion of the DID (such as, paragraphs, parts) is not
   authorized without prior written approval by the HQ AFMC Provisioning Branch. Further, no devia-
   tions, deletions, or changes of provisioning data requirements as prescribed in the AMSDL received
   or initiated by any Air Force activity are authorized without prior written approval by the HQ AFMC
   Provisioning Branch.
   3.2.4. The Single Manager, the SSM or any other organization reviewing data requirements during
   the data call cycle or PR/MIPR coordination are not authorized to change provisioning data require-
   ments without the coordination of the end article item manager (EAIM) ALC Provisioning Activity.
   3.2.5. In response to a data call before or with a PR that will result in an Air Force contract, the ALC
   Provisioning Activity:
       3.2.5.1. Selects the minimum essential DIDs required to satisfy the provisioning requirements of
       the data call from the AMSDL. The selected DIDs are recorded on the DD Form 1423 and sub-
       stantiated on the AF Form 585, Contractor Data Requirements Substantiation. The selected
       DIDs should be coordinated with the SSM and SSM ES.
       3.2.5.2. Identifies and applies applicable Military Standards, or their replacements, such as
       MIL-STD-1388-2B, or their replacements. In the case of a follow-on effort the applicable military
       standards should be those applied to the original contract.
       3.2.5.3. Ensures drawings are requested in sufficient quantities for the SSM/EAIM ALC Provi-
       sioning Activity and for each preprovisioning review activity (i.e., CASC, Defense Logistics
       Agency (DLA)).
       3.2.5.4. Submits the completed provisioning CDRLs and AF Forms 585, if required, to the data
       manager for formal approval by the program manager and inclusion with the system/end article
       data package.
16                                                                                            30 APRIL 1999

     3.2.6. In response to a data call before or with a MIPR, the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity:
        3.2.6.1. Determines the DOD activity assigned contracting responsibility for the system/end arti-
        cle involved.
        3.2.6.2. Ensures the data items applicable to MIL-STD-1388-2B, or its replacement, are indicated
        on the DD Form 1423/AF Forms 585. In the case of a follow-on effort the applicable military stan-
        dards for the original contract are indicated on the AF Forms 585.
        3.2.6.3. Ensures that block 6 and 14 of the DD Form 1423/AF Form 585 shows the SSM/EAIM
        ALC having the end item responsibility and the functional address symbol of the Provisioning
        Activity.

3.3. PR/MIPR Coordination. The PR or MIPR is used to request contracting action for new systems/
end articles or follow-on action for additional programmed requirements. Documents include, when
applicable, provisions for the acquisition of initial spares and citation of funds for the required initial sup-
port. During the coordination of a PR or MIPR, the ALC Provisioning Activity:
     3.3.1. Ensures the PR or MIPR reflects the appropriate acquisition documents, including spares data
     line items.
     3.3.2. Ensures the provisioning DIDs shown on the DD Form 1423 as a result of the data call are
     compatible with the requirements of the PR or MIPR.
     3.3.3. Ensures the IPPS,atch 2, data elements selected satisfy the provisioning effort for the system/
     end article being acquired.
     3.3.4. Ensures the AFMC Form 718, Provisioning Performance Schedule, is included.
     3.3.5. Ensures the above forms are compatible with one another.
     3.3.6. Ensures adequate funds are cited so that the contractor can proceed with the guidance confer-
     ence, preparation of the necessary PTD, and interim release for the first 6-month period after contract
     award. PR/MIPRs received within the Provisioning Activity for coordination should be withheld from
     coordination (concerning provisioning) pending corrective action if they cite (1) "token" dollars in
     amounts inadequate to accomplish a reasonable amount of interim release; (2) "0" dollars without sub-
     stantiating evidence that no guidance conference, PTD, and interim release exist; or (3) a dollar
     amount which appears inadequate to cover the potential cost of interim release and PTD/SDFP during
     the first 6 months of the contract,
     3.3.7. Provides for provisioning management control of the provisioning effort as applicable using
     existing data systems and future systems as they become available.
     3.3.8. Completes all provisioning requirements.

3.4. Release of the PR/MIPR. Release of the coordinated PR/MIPR by the initiating organization to the
contracting activity initiates purchasing action which results in award of a contract. The contractor is pro-
vided copies of the DD Form 1423, the IPPS, and AFMC Form 718 as part of the contract. The SSM/
EAIM ALC, at the time of the contract award or not later than the delivery of the first submission of PTD
on the contract, furnishes involved inventory management specialist (IMS) ALCs with the programming
checklist or with the application program indenture (API) number to locate the programming checklist in
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                           17

the AFMC Provisioning System, Initial Requirements Determination (IRD). Checklist is to be used in
determining initial support requirements.

3.5. Follow-up on PRs/MIPRs:
   3.5.1. During the period of time between coordination on the PR/MIPR and contract award, maintain
   continued surveillance throughout the acquisition negotiation cycle concerning acquisition status and
   receipt of copy of the contract. The copy of the contract sent to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning
   Activity provides milestones for provisioning actions. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity
   must maintain continuing surveillance throughout the contracting cycle. If the Weekly IM/SSM Status
   Report (J041-4PJ-W2-820) does not reflect contract information by the end of a 60-day period, the
   SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity must take the following actions:
       3.5.1.1. Contact the SSM for the PR/MIPRs contracted for by the SSM/EAIM ALC.
       3.5.1.2. Contact the SSM for the PR/MIPRs contracted for by activities outside the SSM/EAIM
       ALC.
   3.5.2. Formal acceptance of an Air Force initiated MIPR by another service should be made within 30
   days and give the estimated contract award date. When it is not included, the appropriate contracting
   office will get this information. After the initial entry of the MIPR in the weekly status report, subse-
   quent entries on a progressive basis should show acceptance, estimated contract award date, reasons
   for delay, if applicable, and contract number and actual award date. Track the progress of the MIPR,
   maintaining formal records of events and milestones.
   3.5.3. Upon receipt of a forecast contract award date, which would jeopardize timely end article
   delivery and logistics support, the ALC Provisioning Activity coordinates action immediately with the
   PR/MIPR initiator to either expedite contract award, slip end article delivery, or develop and provide
   a plan for interim support along with the SSM/EAIM program manager.
   3.5.4. If a copy of the contract is not received within 15 days of the forecasted date, the ALC Provi-
   sioning Activity initiates follow-up action.
   3.5.5. If a timely response to a request for contract status is not received, subsequent follow-up action
   is elevated to higher levels.
   3.5.6. The above procedures are limited to the time period before contract award and do not include
   production follow-up actions. Minimal follow-up action should be required if each weekly status
   report is properly reviewed and provisioning management controls are properly utilized.

3.6. Modification to PR/MIPR. Systems/end articles may be modified during either the production
phase or post-production phase. Regardless of the program period or contracting method, the modifica-
tion may include the acquisition of recoverable components and repair parts that must be provisioned/
SMR coded for support of the new modified configuration. Organizations proposing modification (or pre-
paring contracting directives for the expenditure of maintenance funds) should request the aid of the ALC
Provisioning Activity in identifying the applicable acquisition documents and associated DIDs to be listed
on the DD Form 1423. Identification of correct acquisition documents and DIDs forwarded to Air Force
organizations and contractors during the engineering phase of a modification will help in the timely pro-
visioning of new items after the modification is approved and funded.
18                                                                                           30 APRIL 1999

3.7. Programming Checklist. The SSM/EAIM prepares the Programming Checklist, in accordance
with (IAW) AFMCI 23-106 for each system/end article wherein spares must be acquired for support. The
SSM/EAIM is responsible for inputting the programming checklist into the IRD/requirements data base
(RDB) system and updating as necessary. A copy of the programming checklist is normally provided to
the contractor at the guidance conference or immediately following the guidance conference. This check-
list gives Air Force programming data for end article(s) under contract, and allows the contractor to fore-
cast an interim release to contracting and manufacturing, or to recommend for acquisition the items and
quantities required for maintenance and overhaul of the end articles in the initial phase cited in the check-
list. The IMS ALCs are furnished the application program designation (APD) number to be used to locate
the programming checklist in IRD/RDB either at the time of contract award or not later than with the sub-
mission of the first PTD/SDFP on the contract. This allows development of initial support requirements
on a common basis.

3.8. Receipt of Contract. The provisioning guidance conference must be held not later than 45 days
from receipt of contract by the Provisioning Activity. In the event the provisioning data requirements are
not included in the contract as awarded, the SSM must be notified and action taken to have them added to
the contract before a provisioning guidance conference can be held.

3.9. Statement of Prior Submission (SPS):
     3.9.1. The SPS is used to indicate whether or not the contractor has previously furnished the govern-
     ment with PTD which the contractor believes will satisfy the PTD requirements of the solicitation.
     3.9.2. The SPS applies to the end item or to any component thereof.
     3.9.3. The delivery of the SPS should be defined on the CDRL as follows:

3.10. First Article Acceptance. When the PR/MIPR reflects requirements for first article acceptance,
test, or inspection, the ALC Provisioning Activity adds the following procedure as an attachment: "Pro-
duction Acceptance Test applies to this acquisition." The contractor shall:
     3.10.1. For end articles or components thereof that are not released to production pending production
     acceptance test, provide the PTD/SDFP specified in the DD Form 1423 to the SSM/EAIM ALC, as
     soon as possible, but not later than the submission of the end article or component thereof for produc-
     tion acceptance test. The PTD shall indicate items and quantities considered necessary to support the
     end article or component thereof. Under this condition, interim release authority is not applicable.
     3.10.2. For end articles or components thereof released to production pending production acceptance
     test, proceed to fabricate or place orders with vendors for items and quantities to maintain the end arti-
     cle or components thereof so released under the terms of interim release. Furnish the PTD/SDFP spec-
     ified in DD Forms 1423 to the SSM/EAIM ALC not later than the submission of the end article or
     component thereof for production acceptance test.
     3.10.3. For any engineering changes incurred as a result of the production acceptance test, proceed to
     fabricate or acquire items recommended to support these changes. Furnish DCNs to the SSM/EAIM
     ALC Provisioning Activity specified in the DD Form 1423.

3.11. Notification of Addresses:
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                          19

 3.11.1. Upon receipt of a new contract requiring provisioning action, the ALC Provisioning Activity
 will forward the address of the Contractor and Defense Contract Management Area Operations
 (DCMAO) or defense plant representative office (DPRO), plus applicable contract number, to CASC/
 POA-CDL at Battle Creek, MI. CASC personnel will input addressee information into the D043 sys-
 tem for distribution of national stock number (NSN) notification to the contractor and contract man-
 agement personnel, report number D043-053-WY-MJ9.
 3.11.2. A copy of this notification will be placed in the applicable contract file maintained by the Pro-
 visioning Activity.

                         PREPROPOSAL AND GUIDANCE CONFERENCES

6.1. Preproposal Conference:
     6.1.1. A preproposal conference is encouraged for all major systems/equipment acquisitions. If possi-
     ble, it will be held within 15 days after the RFP or request for quotation (RFQ) has been released. This
     conference may be held for less than major systems/equipment as determined by the Chief of Logis-
     tics (CL)/ILSM/SSM/EAIM Provisioning Activity.
     6.1.2. During this conference the offeror(s) is alerted of the provisioning requirements for the produc-
     tion contract. Sufficient details on the provisioning documentation and data submission media and
     procedures will be provided so that the offeror can provide realistic responses to the RFP or RFQ.
     This communication between the Air Force and the offeror can provide the Contracting Office with
     topics to negotiate during the production contract negotiations. This provides a responsive and effec-
     tive provisioning effort.

6.2. Provisioning Guidance Conference:
     6.2.1. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity should schedule the provisioning guidance con-
     ference immediately after the contract award, normally within 60 days. The guidance conference pro-
     vides a means by which the contractor, major vendors, and Air Force personnel can gain a mutual
     understanding of the contractual requirements. Responsibilities should be clearly defined and the var-
     ious deadlines in the provisioning cycle should be specifically identified.
     6.2.2. The guidance conference also provides an opportunity for explanation of the current logistics
     concept or plan applicable to the system/end article under contract as well as the techniques and meth-
     ods used by the Air Force in requirements determinations.
     6.2.3. This conference should result in a mutual understanding, and reduce some of the more crucial
     problems inherent in provisioning, such as:
        6.2.3.1. Improperly prepared PTD.
        6.2.3.2. Delinquent submission of PTD.
        6.2.3.3. Inadequate/omitted SDFP.
        6.2.3.4. Incomplete or invalid recommendations by the contractor.
        6.2.3.5. Late scheduling of the provisioning conference and the resulting delivery of the initial
        support.
     6.2.4. The first step toward a guidance conference is to confirm that the IPPS with attachments was
     included in the contract. If included proceed with preparation for the guidance conference. In the
     event the IPPS with attachments is not included in the contract, the SSM must be informed and action
     taken to have them included in the contract through the PPCO before a provisioning guidance confer-
     ence is held. The conference will be held at the earliest possible date after award of the EMD or pro-
     duction contract. The ALC Provisioning Activity should insist on a guidance conference whether or
     not one has been held before with the same contractor. Although the depth of discussions on general
     items of interest may vary in later conferences with the same contractor, each contract awarded will be
     considered in relation to its own requirements, and a milestone of events (provisioning performance
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                           29

   schedule (PPS)) will be developed and tailored accordingly. The SSM/EAIM ALC provisioning chief
   has the authority to make a decision on the need to hold a formal guidance conference only in the
   event cancellation is requested by the contractor. Prior approval by the HQ AFMC Provisioning
   Branch is not required. Copies of all correspondence concerning such matters should be forwarded to
   the HQ AFMC Provisioning Branch.
   6.2.5. The ALC Provisioning Activity recommends to the contractor, through the ACO, a date for the
   guidance conference. This date will be not later than 45 days after receipt of the contract at the PPA.
   The date established by the contractor must be within 5 days of the date recommended by the ALC
   Provisioning Activity.
   6.2.6. The guidance conference may be held at either the contractor's facility or the SSM/EAIM ALC.
   The SSM/EAIM ALC selects the location based on the pertinent facts or administrative circumstances
   associated with each particular contract.

6.3. Attendance. Participation at the preproposal and guidance conferences generally includes qualified
representatives from the prime contractor and the major vendors, SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity
(including major recoverable assembly IMSs when involved), using commands, the ACO or authorized
representative, and ALC Data Automation when the AFMC Provisioning System is used. When Product
Center contracts are involved, the SPD should provide representatives. Other involved services will be
invited to attend guidance conferences for multiservice contracts. HQ AFMC Provisioning Branch may
attend major guidance conferences to ensure the quality of guidance provided corresponds with that
required. CASC/LLGHE-CDL should receive notification of scheduled guidance conferences. Confer-
ences involving major or critical systems are attended by CASC personnel. The Chairperson for the pre-
proposal and guidance conference is provided by the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity or RPT,
when applicable. Other segments of the SSM/EAIM ALC to be represented should normally include engi-
neering and reliability, material support, investment and stock fund requirements, distribution, packaging
and materials handling, planning, technical support and data automation when required. The ACO's atten-
dance is necessary since the PPCO or ACO guide or restrict discussions and agreements regarding con-
tractual commitments on the part of both the Air Force and the contractor.

6.4. Planning the Conferences. The following planning and preliminary actions are the basic ones
required of the Conference Chairperson. Before the preproposal or guidance conference, the Chairperson:
   6.4.1. Establishes a firm date and location with the contractor or prospective contractor(s).
   6.4.2. Prepares and distributes, on a timely basis, the conference notification, AFMC Form 771. If
   sufficient time is not available to insure delivery of the conference notification by mail, the notifica-
   tion will be issued by message.
   6.4.3. Develops agenda and furnishes a copy with each AFMC Form 771 distributed (Guidance Con-
   ference only).
   6.4.4. Prepares or reviews tentative milestone dates for the provisioning actions (Guidance Confer-
   ence only).
   6.4.5. Obtains qualified personnel for detailed discussions.
   6.4.6. Has sufficient copies of the IPPS with attachments and applicable programming checklists
   available for the conference.

     6.4.7. Arranges reservations and transportation, as necessary.
     6.4.8. Holds a closed Air Force familiarization meeting before conducting the conference to:
        6.4.8.1. Review proposed agenda for the conference.
        6.4.8.2. Resolve any difference of opinion.
        6.4.8.3. Establish or review the rules of conduct to be in effect during the conference.
        6.4.8.4. Recognize and resolve any questions/discussions that relate solely to internal Air Force
        affairs so as to avoid undue embarrassment.
        6.4.8.5. Achieve an Air Force position.
        6.4.8.6. Review the provisioning strategy.
     6.4.9. Requests contractor to hold a briefing on the system/end article on contract (Guidance Confer-

       • Introduction of conferees.
       • Administrative matters.
       • Review of agenda.
       • Conduct of Conference.
       • Work Schedule.
   6.6.2. Presentation of Provisioning Process:
      6.6.2.1. The Conference Chairperson gives a brief presentation on the provisioning process based
      on the applicable acquisition document, to meet the needs of the group and not be in competition
      with the detailed discussion on specific subjects. The briefing should cover the provisioning pro-
      cess from contract award through placing of final orders and delivery, outlining those actions and
      procedures needed to ensure support is available when needed by the using organization.
      6.6.2.2. A brief explanation of the terms, provisioning conferences, spares, SMR coding, PTD
      and SDFP should aid in establishing a basic understanding of provisioning terms.
32                                                                                         30 APRIL 1999

     6.6.3. Contractor Presentation. The contractor should explain the system/end article, proposed
     actions, and the proposed PPS relative to meeting contractual requirements (Guidance Conference
     only).
     6.6.4. Programming Information (Guidance Conference only):
        6.6.4.1. Following a brief introduction by the Conference Chairperson, the requirements and dis-
        tribution representative of the SSM/EAIM ALC gives a detailed presentation on the programming
        checklist(s) applicable to the contract:
            6.6.4.1.1. The applicable programming checklist should be provided to the contractor with the
            contract award. If this was not done, the checklist will be provided at the guidance conference.
            The programming checklist is then reviewed and discussed to ensure understanding by the
            contractor.
            6.6.4.1.2. The prime contractor's responsibilities to instruct vendors/subcontractors on the
            requirements in the applicable acquisition document, CDRLs, the IPPS and the use of pro-
            gramming checklists to fulfill the data and other contractual requirements will be enumerated.
        6.6.4.2. Due to the interface between the programming data and the requirements determination,
        the detailed presentation on initial spares requirements determination should be given next by the
        SSM/EAIM ALC requirements and distribution representative.
     6.6.5. Maintenance Concept. This presentation by the engineering and reliability branch representa-
     tive of the SSM/EAIM ALC should include:
        6.6.5.1. The purpose of the provisioning conference and how the actions provide the contractor
        with data for inclusion in the illustrated parts breakdown (IPB) should be explained in depth.
        6.6.5.2. The SMR coding of components that make up an end article will be based on the mainte-
        nance concept desired and the design of the items being coded. The maintenance concept (includ-
        ing repair level analysis (RLA) when applicable) should be discussed in depth before discussing
        the SMR codes. The concept discussed should include integrated support planning (Air Force
        Supplement to DODI 5000.2) and the objectives of direct vendor contact.
        6.6.5.3. A detailed definition of SMR codes, including the principles, policies and procedures for
        these codes is contained in TO 00-25-195.
        6.6.5.4. The failure factors covered in the IPPS should be thoroughly discussed with the contrac-
        tor.
     6.6.6. Initial Provisioning Performance Specification (IPPS). The Conference Chairperson should
     discuss the IPPS emphasizing that the prime contractor forward a copy to each of the vendors/sub con-
     tractors for compliance. The requirement for HQ AFMC's written approval of any changes, devia-
     tions, and new/additional provisioning requirements should also be emphasized. The contractor
     should be advised to provide adequate SDFP for all logical requirements IAW the contract terms and
     the applicable data item.
     6.6.7. Interim Release Concept. The Conference Chairperson should explain the interim release
     authority and restrictions outlined in applicable acquisition documents.
     6.6.8. Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL). The Conference Chairperson discusses those
     requirements listed on DD Form 1423 pertinent to provisioning:
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                         33

    6.6.8.1. Provisioning screening by contractors is no longer required except for those contracts
    where PTD is to be processed manually. It will be accomplished mechanically by the Government
    through the AFMC Provisioning System.
    6.6.8.2. SDFP (drawings) requirements. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity or CASC
    will cover this portion, explaining the provisioning rules for drawing requirements to satisfy the
    SMR coding, item entry control and cataloging and standardization requirements. That all SDFP
    called for in the contract is to be delivered in a timely manner. That letters of refusal will not be
    accepted unless they provide an acceptable alternate method for providing the required data to the
    Government.
    6.6.8.3. The Conference Chairperson will discuss the various types of PTD requirements, format,
    content, distribution, and the applicable CDRLs. Discussion should be in sufficient detail for the
    contractor and prime vendors to fully recognize the full scope of this important facet. Inadequacy
    of data and/or untimely submission can have serious repercussions on all subsequent action. Dis-
    cussions should also bring into focus the relationship between the IPPS, the provisioning data
    requirements reflected on the DD Form 1423, and applicable acquisition documents.
        6.6.8.3.1. Instructions for preparation of the various types of PTD in accordance with the
        IPPS and attachments thereto, and the applicable DIDs should be reviewed in-depth for the
        benefit of the contractor.
        6.6.8.3.2. The requirement for a repairable item list (RIL) will be explained including the pur-
        pose, and how and when the requirement is determined and established. The contractor should
        be advised to submit the RIL not later than 60 days after receipt of request.
 6.6.9. Provisioning conference. The Conference Chairperson should negotiate a date with the con-
 tractor for holding the provisioning conference. Discussions should also include:
    6.6.9.1. PTD and SDFP to be furnished before the scheduled provisioning conference.
    6.6.9.2. PTD and SDFP to be available at the scheduled provisioning conference.
    6.6.9.3. Availability of adequate facilities and equipment.
    6.6.9.4. Attendance of qualified contractor personnel, technical and clerical support (including
    subcontractor and vendors as required).
    6.6.9.5. Inspection tour of the mock-up/production line of the system/end article being provi-
    sioned.
 6.6.10. Orders and Delivery Schedules:
    6.6.10.1. Placing of orders:
        6.6.10.1.1. The Conference Chairperson should outline the flow of the PIO from the IMS,
        through the SSM/EAIM ALC to the contractor, including the process and media available for
        developing and placing of the PIO as a result of the provisioning process.
        6.6.10.1.2. If the end article is being bought through another service, particular emphasis
        should be placed on the changes in the repair parts order flow and procedures.
    6.6.10.2. Delivery Schedules. The Conference Chairperson should point out that the Government
    will furnish the contractor a required delivery schedule on an AFMC Form 326, Provisioned Item
    Order or automated PIO.
34                                                                                        30 APRIL 1999

            6.6.10.2.1. If unable to meet the required delivery schedule, the contractor will submit a pro-
            posed line item delivery schedule for such items to the ALC Provisioning Activity through the
            ACO.
            6.6.10.2.2. The contractor's proposed delivery schedule will be accepted if support by the
            specified need date is not jeopardized. After the contractor's proposed changes have been
            agreed to by the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity and approved by the ACO, the
            approved delivery schedule will be incorporated into the contract at definitization.
     6.6.11. Preservation and Packaging. The Packaging and Materiel Handling Branch representative
     will discuss DI-PACK-80120/ DI-PACK-80121 as they pertain to items acquired through provision-
     ing.
     6.6.12. Design changes. The Conference Chairperson should emphasize the contractor's responsibil-
     ity for notifying the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity of all design changes.
     6.6.13. Data automation. If the AFMC Provisioning System is used to provision a system/end article,
     the SSM/EAIM ALC data automation representative will explain system input requirements and edits
     and output products returned to the contractor.
     6.6.14. Other Related Subjects. This discussion, or series of discussions, is monitored by the Confer-
     ence Chairperson and tailored to those subjects for which there is no specific data item. Procedures
     and techniques should be discussed for subjects such as:
        6.6.14.1. Procedure for contractor to follow to obtain Government furnished property (GFP).
        6.6.14.2. Repair Part kits concept, AFMCMAN 25-1, Repair Parts Kits (D031) Users Manual.
        6.6.14.3. MMAC techniques and criteria.
        6.6.14.4. Item Management Coding (IMC) techniques and criteria.
        6.6.14.5. Concurrent release of spares orders with production order releases.
        6.6.14.6. Identifying any clothing and/or textile type requirements. If any are identified, the ALC
        Provisioning Activity will, subsequent to the provisioning conference, transmit these to the Air
        Force Clothing and Textile Office (AFC&TO) for development of a support request package by
        AFC&TO personnel.
     6.6.15. Completion of PPS. PPS milestones should be completed at this point (Guidance Conference
     only).
     6.6.16. Preparation of Minutes. The Chairperson prepares and distributes the minutes of the guidance
     conference including a copy of the applicable PPS and guidance conference checklist.
     6.6.17. Conference Checklist. Format listing the various actions to be concluded during the confer-
     ences is shown in Figure 6-1. This checklist will be used by the Conference Chairperson as a guide to
     make sure all applicable elements of data were covered during the conference.

 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                         37

                                               Chapter 7
                      PROVISIONING PERFORMANCE SCHEDULE (PPS)

7.1. Purpose. AFMC Form 718, is a management tool for both the Government (SSM/EAIM ALC Pro-
visioning Activity and RPT) and the contractor. The PPS describes and plots, in time frames by calendar
dates, those significant actions and events of the provisioning process that must be accomplished by both
the ALC Provisioning Activity and the contractor to provide adequate initial support by the OND.

7.2. Application. The AFMC Form 718 is made a part of the PR package during the data call process or
the PR/MIPR coordination cycle, incorporated in the resultant RFP, RFQ or invitation for bid (IFB) and,
in turn, the production contract.

7.3. Policy:
   7.3.1. A blank AFMC Form 718 must be attached to each provisioning package as an attachment to
   the IPPS at time of coordination for ultimate inclusion with subsequent RFP, IFB or RFQ. The con-
   tractor completes the AFMC Form 718 along with the offer. The AFMC Form 718 becomes a part of
   the contractor's response to the RFP, IFB or RFQ and is reviewed by the AFMC Provisioning Activity
   before contract award for adequacy in meeting the OND.
   7.3.2. The PPS will be thoroughly reviewed and completed at the guidance conference. At this time,
   contractor established milestones are converted to calendar dates to make review of the PPS easier.
   The chairperson of the conference, the contractor, and the program manager, if present, will sign the
   PPS to denote acceptance and understanding. The approved PPS will be placed in the minutes.
   7.3.3. The agreed upon milestones (completed AFMC Form 718) will be placed in the contract by
   supplemental agreement.
   7.3.4. Where agreement cannot be reached and initial support cannot be achieved by the operational
   need date, the chairperson will contact the ACO/DPRO contract management specialist to assist in
   reaching a mutually acceptable date.
   7.3.5. The chairperson will also determine if accelerated techniques can help in meeting the OND.
   7.3.6. When satisfactory milestones cannot be agreed upon at the guidance conference, the provision-
   ing chairperson will apprise appropriate management levels within the SSM/EAIM ALC of the spe-
   cific problem areas for review and resolution.

7.4. Development:
   7.4.1. Elements of data essential to develop PPS for specific contracts to ensure support by the OND
   are:
       7.4.1.1. Contract effective date. Obtained from the contract.
       7.4.1.2. Spares need date. The date by which spares are required to be in place for the support of
       the system/end articles as they enter the inventory and become operational. When warranties and/
       or interim contractor support (ICS) are involved in the provisioning effort, the terms and condi-
       tions of the warranties and/or ICS on contract should be used in determining the spares need date,
       e.g., if a three-year warranty applies to spares, then the OND should be prior to leadtime from the
38                                                                                          30 APRIL 1999

        expiration date. The date that is determined should be used in the OND field in the provisioning
        operational plan (POP) to record a realistic date repair parts required (DRPR) that will feed to
        D169.
     7.4.2. After determining the starting and completion dates and the provisioning milestones required,
     the milestone dates should be set up. The contractor's capabilities and past performance must be taken
     into account if the PPS is to be realistic. The completed PPS will reflect the contractor's stated capa-
     bility, and must be compatible with the terms of the executed contract.
     7.4.3. To accomplish provisioning milestones, the time cycles are detailed in the acquisition docu-
     ments and related data items. The provisioning manager's PPS should be realistic. A determination
     can then be made as to whether sufficient, insufficient, or surplus time is available for provisioning.
        7.4.3.1. Less Than the Norm. To meet the situation when less time than is required is available to
        accomplish provisioning, the provisioning time cycle must be compressed. This will be equal in
        measure with the terms of the contract and the contractor's stated capability and be in relation to
        the requirements of the applicable acquisition documents and data items. Two possible areas for
        compression are scheduling the guidance conference just as early as possible, and the contractor's
        ability to prepare and submit required PTD and SDFP. Generally, as a result of competitive con-
        tracting, the contractor has stated the capability to perform in a timely manner. The development
        of the PPS is merely a means of establishing, plotting, and recording what the applicable major
        provisioning actions are, who accomplishes them, and specifically when the actions should be
        taken. Earlier scheduling of the guidance conference, contractor acceleration of the LLIL, early
        development of the provisioning parts list (PPL), application of APC and interim support by the
        contractor are some of the alternate ways to compress provisioning time frames. All reductions of
        the provisioning time cycles must be realistic.
        7.4.3.2. Greater Than the Norm. When this occurs, the time cycles between provisioning mile-
        stones are extended or provisioning is delayed. Although the relationship to the norm is not
        all-important, it must be considered. Where production is not due to start for 12 months, no pur-
        pose will be served by scheduling the receipt of PTD and SDFP too early.
     7.4.4. In determining the specific dates for each provisioning milestone, the following major actions/
     events should be considered.

        provide logistics support.
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                        39

    7.4.4.5. Step 4 - Event 11 - Training Start Date. The established date wherein spares are needed to
    provide logistics support for training equipment.
    7.4.4.6. Step 5 - Event 2 - Guidance Conference. The guidance conference should be held at the
    earliest possible date but in no event later than 45 days after the mailing date of the contract.
    (Chapter 6, para 6.2.5).
    7.4.4.7. Step 6 - Event 3 - Defense Logistics Service Center (DLSC) Screening. Only applies to
    manual PTD processing. The contractor submits provisioning screening data to DLSC not earlier
    than 30 days prior to the submittal of PTD to the address cited on the CDRL.
    7.4.4.8. Step 7 - Event 4a - Candidate List. The contractor must submit a list of recommended
    SAIP items not later than 165 days prior to the contractor's required order need date.
    7.4.4.9. Step 8 - Event 4b - Selected Item Notification. The Provisioning Activity must advise the
    contractor of the SAIP items selected not later than 30 days after receipt of the SAIP candidate
    List.
    7.4.4.10. Step 9 - Event 4c - Contractor Procurement Schedule. The contractor must submit the
    SAIP item procurement schedule, PTD and SDFP with screening results not later than 90 days
    prior to the contractor's order need date.
    7.4.4.11. Step 10 - Event 4d - Provisioning Conference. A provisioning conference, if required,
    for the SAIP items should be scheduled not later than 60 days prior to the contractor's order need
    date.
    7.4.4.12. Step 11 - Event 4e - PIO release to Contractor. PIOs should be released to the contractor
    not later than 30 days prior to the contractor's order need date.
    7.4.4.13. Step 12 - Event 5a - Interim released Items. The contractor must fabricate or acquire
    spares qualifying under interim release. The contractor may begin interim releasing spares imme-
    diately after effective date of the contract. However, interim release LLILs will be furnished no
    later than 30 days after the contractor has interim released for fabrication or procurement of
    spares.
    7.4.4.14. Step 13 - Event 5b - Recommended Items. These items will be furnished by the contrac-
    tor as soon as possible after award of the contract and progressively as quickly as engineering
    design and data are released by the contractor. A reasonable cutoff date by which all LLILs should
    be received for Air Force processing would be 45 days prior to release of PPL by the contractor.
    7.4.4.15. Step 14 - Event 5c - Provisioning Conference. A provisioning conference, if required,
    for the long lead items should be scheduled no later than 90 days prior to the contractor's order
    need date.
    7.4.4.16. Step 15 - Event 5d - long lead item (LLI) PIOs Released to Contractor. PIOs for LLIs
    should be released to the contractor within 30 days of receipt of the LLIL. However, outstanding
    PIOs for LLIs should be submitted no later than 30 days after receipt of the last contractor submit-
    ted LLIL. (Chapter 10).
    7.4.4.17. Step 16 - Event 6 - PTD/SDFP Requirements. The contractor will prepare and submit
    the PTD/SDFP not Later than 60 days prior to the scheduled provisioning conference. (Chapter
    15).
40                                                                                       30 APRIL 1999

       7.4.4.18. Step 17 - Event 7 - Provisioning Conference. The scheduling of the provisioning confer-
       ence depends upon the capability of the contractor to produce the required PTD and SDFP on a
       timely basis. However, the conference must be scheduled no later than 60 days after receipt of
       PTD/SDFP. (Chapter 14).
       7.4.4.19. Step 18 - Event 8 - PIOs with Delivery Schedule. The Provisioning Activity must sub-
       mit PIOs to the contractor 60 days after the provisioning conference to ensure contractor's ability
       to have support in place by the OND. (Chapter 28).
       7.4.4.20. Step 19 - Event 9 - Contractor's Acceptance/Revised Delivery Schedule. When the Gov-
       ernment provides a required delivery schedule with each PIO, the contractor must accept the order
       and within 60 days notify the Government of acceptance of the schedule or provide a proposed
       line item delivery schedule for negotiation. The approved schedule will be incorporated into the
       contract when the PIO is definitized.
       7.4.4.21. Remarks. Comments must be provided in this block for any discrepancies in the calen-
       dar dates, or for any justification for actions taken outside of the standard/normal time frames.
       7.4.4.22. Approval Signature Blocks. The completed form must be signed by the Air Force provi-
       sioning chairperson, contractor representative and applicable program manager.

7.5. Disposition. The PPS is maintained throughout the life of the production contract. After completion
of all provisioning actions, the PPS is retired with the appropriate contract folder.
  30 APRIL 1999                                                                                           41

                                                 Chapter 8
                      SUPPLEMENTAL DATA FOR PROVISIONING (SDFP)

8.1. Purpose. SDFP is the technical data acquired by contract to support provisioning requirements
established by logistics support analysis subtask 401.2.8. SDFP is necessary to assign SMR Codes to each
provisioning line item sequence number (PLISN) on the Provisioning Lists; to assign an IMC; to prevent
proliferation of identical items in the Government inventory; for maintenance decisions; and for the item
identification information necessary for the assignment of a NSN.

8.2. Requirements:
   8.2.1. For all of the uses of SDFP, it must provide a unique identification. This definition of item
   identification is a product of the cataloging system which was established by Public Law 436, The
   Defense Cataloging and Standardization Act. DoD 4130.2-M, Federal Catalog System Policy Manual,
   Subsection 23, defines item identification:
Under the Federal Catalog System the concept of eachitem of supply is expressed in, and fixed by, an
itemidentification. The item identification will consist of the minimum data required to establish, directly
or indirectly, the essential characteristics of the item which give the item its unique character and make it
what it is, and to differentiate it from every other item of supply used by the Federal Government.

NOTE:
DLA has assigned to DLSC the responsibility for maintaining item identifications. DLSC controls item
identification by assigning each approved item name (AIN) to a Federal Item Identification Guide (FIIG).
The FIIG establishes the requirements for describing the "essential characteristics" of an item.
Basic item identification is derived from the commercial and Government entity (CAGE) codes and part
numbers (P/Ns) cited on the item's design drawing plus all the technical and management information in
any segment of the NSN record including the characteristics description.
   8.2.2. SDFP is product engineering drawings and commercial data. Both product drawings and com-
   mercial data shall be delivered under MIL-T-31000, Specification for technical data packages (TDPs),
   when that specification is on contract. Product drawings are delivered utilizing DID DI-DRPR-81000,
   Product Drawings and Associated Lists, and DD Form 2554-1, TDP Option Selection Worksheet
   (See Figure 8-1). Data defining commercial items which are not defined by DI-DRPR-81000 can be
   delivered under MIL-T-31000 by DI-DRPR-81003, Commercial Drawings and Associated Lists, and
   DD Form 2554-4, TDP Option Selection Worksheet (See Figure 8-2). When MIL-T-31000 is not on
   contract, SDFP will be acquired utilizing DI-ILSS-81289, Supplemental Data for Provisioning.
   8.2.3. SDFP is required for each item appearing on Provisioning Lists (DI-ALSS-81529/T) (First
   Appearance only), except for those PLISNs which are identified by definitive U.S. National Industry
   Association, U.S. Government, or International specifications or standards which are listed in the
   Department of Defense Index of Specifications and Standards (DODISS). An exception is that SDFP
   is not required for PLISNs identified by an NSN which has a Full Descriptive Type Item Identification
   (Type 1, 1A or 1B).
42                                                                                         30 APRIL 1999

NOTE:
The Data Manager (DM), Provisioning Specialist, and program Engineering Data Management Officer
(EDMO) must review statement of work/statement of objective (SOW/SOO) and CDRL language when
the data is being acquired. When DI-DRPR-81003 is required to provide SDFP, explicit tailoring lan-
guage in addition to customary SDFP language must be provided by the program EDMO.
     8.2.4. The order of precedence for SDFP is first product engineering drawings and then commercial
     data. When product drawings are provided for SDFP, the selection is determined by whichever pro-
     vides a more definitive item description. For example, an assembly drawing should not be provided
     when a detail drawing is under contract; other assembly drawings should not be provided when a
     detail assembly drawing is available. Installation assembly drawings should never be provided
     because they do not provide the essential characteristics of items.
     8.2.5. If a drawing, within each Submission Control code (SCC), contains multiple part numbers
     identified by dashes that represent items with the same form, fit and function, i.e., color coded wire,
     etc., only one copy of the drawing, for the first appearance dash number, will be required. The Provi-
     sioning Line Item Sequence Number (PLISN) of all other dash numbers appearing on that drawing
     will be annotated on the drawing provided. If the part numbers identified by dashes do not represent
     items with the same form, fit and function, a copy of the drawing for each dash number will be
     required.
     8.2.6. Commercial data is not developed under Government contract. It includes engineering draw-
     ings and company specifications. While the format will be different from product drawings and lists,
     it must provide the essential characteristics necessary to establish a unique item identification.
     8.2.7. The Provisioning Activity is responsible to provide the work statement requirements for the
     SOW/SOO. Recommended SOW/SOO language is as follows:
The contractor shall plan for the delivery of product TDP documentation to define the items identified.
SDFP shall enable the Government to uniquely identify each first appearance item shown from other
comparable items in the Government supply inventory (the Defense Logistics Information System, Total
Item Record). The contractor shall satisfy SDFP requirements first with product drawings TDP docu-
ments. When SDFP requires identification of items which are not included in the product TDP, the con-
tractor shall plan for the delivery of vendor, commercial item documentation. For example, when the
requirements for the engineering TDP are satisfied by a vendor item control drawing (e.g., for a fan), def-
inition of the parts comprising the item (fan), a commercial drawing, catalog data, or technical manual
with picture and parts list shall be provided. The contractor shall plan for and provide technical data to
support design change notices (DCNs).

8.3. Delivery:
     8.3.1. The contractor shall deliver SDFP at the time(s) and in the format(s) specified by the CDRL
     and the Provisioning Performance Schedule, AFMC Form 718. The specified delivery timeframe will
     normally be 60 days prior to the provisioning conference.
     8.3.2. When DOD FAR Supplement (DFARS) 252.227-7013, rights in technical data and computer
     software, is placed on the contract, SDFP describing items with limited rights to the Government must
     be delivered. The Government is then responsible to limit access to this data to "U.S. Government Use
     Only." Limited rights SDFP shall not be used to support a competitive procurement without a formal
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                             43

   review of the development of the item which the data supports. At the provisioning guidance confer-
   ence, the Air Force will remind the prime contractor that this data must be delivered. IAW DFARS
   252.227-7013, subcontractors and vendors may deliver this data directly to the addressee listed on the
   CDRL.
   8.3.3. Limited rights to the Government must be stamped or otherwise identified with the contractu-
   ally approved limitation statement. When this restriction is changed, engineering drawings will be
   revised and the statement on them either reworded or deleted.
   8.3.4. If SDFP is not delivered IAW the CDRL and the PPS, the Provisioning Activity will request
   the Procuring Contracting Office to take action to obtain the data including a "show cause" letter. The
   DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, signifying Government receipt and
   acceptance of the data will not be signed until all contractual requirements have been met and verified
   by all recipients. In order to recover Government costs, legal action should be taken against a contrac-
   tor who fails to deliver SDFP as specified in the contract.
   8.3.5. Provisioning Activity should request that their contracting and legal office (JAG) attend guid-
   ance conferences when data requirements are discussed. Their expertise should be employed espe-
   cially with delivery of limited rights data and letters of refusal. Letters of refusal can be submitted but
   not in lieu of furnishing the technical data specified in the contract. Such letters must recommend
   alternate methods of furnishing adequate SDFP.

8.4. Disposition:
   8.4.1. SDFP is no longer useful when all the actions required to complete the provisioning process for
   a particular acquisition contract have ended.
   8.4.2. The following SDFP must be destroyed by shredding or equal means: Limited rights to the
   Government, restricted data (software), and data marked with distribution statements other than "A".
   Classified data is disposed of IAW DoD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401.

                                                 Chapter 9
                                     PREPROVISIONING REVIEW

9.1. General. The provisioning goal is to develop effectual logistics support to attain maximum cost
effective readiness. Therefore a quality preprovisioning review by all respective organizations is desir-
able.

NOTE:
Preprovisioning review is currently conducted by CASC for items managaged by both the Air Force and
DLA. A memorandum of understanding is currently in draft which will give DLA responsibility for pre-
provisioning review of DLA-managed items. For the purposes of this instruction, the organization respon-
sibile for preprovisioning review will be referred to as the "cataloging activity" to encompass possible
DLA involvement in the future.

9.2. Policy. Cataloging activity personnel perform complete item entry control and a provisioning data
review on every line item proposed for procurement as an initial spare. This review results in fewer new
items entering the inventory, hence a cost avoidance for the Air Force and DOD.

9.3. Procedures:
     9.3.1. The prime contractor will provide PTD in top down breakdown sequence or as specified in the
     IPPS and/or applicable CDRL. PTD will be submitted on tape and will be forwarded to the prime Pro-
     visioning Activity for input to the AFMC Provisioning System, unless a manual provisioning effort is
     authorized. One copy of all SDFP will be delivered at least 6O days prior to each provisioning event
     to the following organizations:
        9.3.1.1. CASC/POA-CDL.
        9.3.1.2. Prime Provisioning Activity.
     9.3.2. The prime Provisioning Activity reviews, edits, evaluates and inspects all PTD to ensure con-
     tractual compliance and to ensure receipt of SDFP. The cataloging activity will perform an in depth
     review of all PTD and SDFP either through the Cataloging and Standardization Center Provisioning
     System (D155) or manually. The cataloging activity will advise the prime Provisioning Activity of
     receipt of PTD for which no support SDFP has been provided. Information provided as a result of
     review will help the SSM/EAIM ALC provisioning office to determine whether PTD should be
     accepted or rejected. PTD should not be arbitrarily rejected for minor discrepancies. If the in-depth
     review of the PTD indicates rejection, the provisioning office will notify the contractor and the ACO
     promptly so the provisioning event can be postponed to allow corrective action to be taken. An infor-
     mation copy of any rejection letter to the contractor will be furnished by the prime Provisioning Activ-
     ity to the PPCO and to CASC/POA. If minor discrepancies are noted, the prime Provisioning Activity
     will immediately notify the contractor so that corrective action can be accomplished prior to or during
     the provisioning event.
     9.3.3. After the tape is received by the Provisioning Activity and input into the AFMC Provisioning
     System, the DLSC total item record (TIR) is interrogated and screening results for the items are over-
     laid to the PTD. The cataloging activity will be identified as a data recipient for screening in the DLSC
     provisioning screening master address table (PSMAT).
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                           45

 9.3.4. Cataloging activity personnel will review all applicable PTD and SDFP for every provisioning
 event, whether desktop or conference. (When DLA participates in the preprovisioning review, CASC
 will only review reparable items and all FSCs not managed by DLA). Once the entire package is
 received, the following review actions will be taken by the cataloging agency.
    9.3.4.1. Review of SDFP to determine the following:
        9.3.4.1.1. Adequacy for cataloging and standardization functions.
        9.3.4.1.2. Completeness/compliance with contractual requirements.
        9.3.4.1.3. Annotation of PLISNs on each drawing.
        9.3.4.1.4. Drawing reference number(s) match reference number(s) on the provisioning docu-
        ment.
        9.3.4.1.5. Proper CAGE, reference number and reference number category code (RNCC) are
        listed on the PTD in the appropriate block according to the type of drawing received, (vendor
        item drawing, source control, selected item drawing or altered item drawing).
    9.3.4.2. Review provisioning document and reference number screening results to:
        9.3.4.2.1. Validate or assign correct FSC.
        9.3.4.2.2. Validate or assign AIN.
        9.3.4.2.3. Ensure correct NSN and related data has been selected and overlaid by the AFMC
        Provisioning System.
        9.3.4.2.4. Ensure NSN, major organizational entity (MOE) rule and MMAC are current.
        9.3.4.2.5. Validate or assign primary inventory control activity (PICA), hardness critical item
        (HCI) codes, etc., in applicable data blocks of the provisioning document.
        9.3.4.2.6. Validate IMC.
    9.3.4.3. Perform in house research to determine interchangeability.
    9.3.4.4. Determine validity of P/N construction.
    9.3.4.5. Perform in house research to determine whether a substitute exists for the requested part.
    Recommend use of proposed substitute item when applicable. Supporting documentation will be
    provided when available.
    9.3.4.6. The cataloging activity will input interchangeability & substitutability (I&S) data to the
    I&S Decision Record (DO63) file for historical purposes.
 9.3.5. All applicable discrepancies will be reported by the cataloging activity via letter or the Catalog-
 ing and Standardization Center Provisioning System (D155) discrepancy report to the prime Provi-
 sioning Activity for resolution prior to provisioning event if possible. Major discrepancies should be a
 consideration for postponement or cancellation of the provisioning event.
 9.3.6. When a document is being manually worked, all corrections and/or recommendations will be
 neatly annotated on the provisioning document. A provisioning parts list review worksheet (PPLRW)
 (from CASC) or a DD Form 2241, Standard/Alternate Item Referral (from DLA), will be included
 with all recommended substitutes. For automated documents worked in D155, all corrections will
 automatically be forwarded to the AFMC Provisioning System to be overlaid onto the document. Any
46                                                                                         30 APRIL 1999

     recommendations or substitutions made on items processed through D155 will be forwarded on Dis-
     crepancy Reports. The technician's name and phone number will be included for use if recommenda-
     tion is questioned. Substantiation for any declination will be provided to the technician. All
     declinations will be included in conference minutes or by letter to the cataloging activity if a formal
     conference is not held.
     9.3.7. SDFP for items which will require cataloging action will be retained by the cataloging activity
     until subsequent cataloging requests for item entry action are received. The appropriate SDFP will
     then be consolidated with the cataloging requests, eliminating the need for ALCs to submit a second
     set of SDFP with requests for cataloging action.
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                          47

                              LONG LEAD TIME ITEM LIST (LLIL)

10.1. General:
   10.1.1. Generally, the LLIL is the first type of PTD submitted by the contractor. The LLIL is a list of
   those items which, due to their complexity of design, complicated manufacturing processes, or limited
   production, require early ordering to ensure adequate delivery schedules.
   10.1.2. At the close of the guidance conference, both the contractor and the Air Force should be in
   agreement as to the type of items to be submitted on the LLIL. Instructions on the use and processing
   of the LLIL will have been given to the contractor.

10.2. Policy:
   10.2.1. When interim release is authorized by the IPPS, the contractor will segregate and identify
   interim release items from the balance of long lead items..
   10.2.2. The contractor will develop and furnish LLILs to the SSM/EAIM ALC as soon as the design
   development and availability of engineering data permits. LLILs reflecting interim released items
   must be submitted as soon as possible, but in no event later than 30 days after interim release has been
   effected.
   10.2.3. All LLILs, whether interim released or recommended items, will be supported with the
   required SDFP.
   10.2.4. The SSM/EAIM ALC provisioning manager reviews, edits, evaluates and inspects all PTD to
   ensure contractual compliance and to ensure receipt of SDFP.
   10.2.5. The SSM/EAIM ALC provisioning manager is responsible for acceptance or rejection of the
   PTD. PTD should not be arbitrarily rejected for minor deficiencies; impending support should be con-
   sidered. If the PTD must be rejected, the provisioning manager should notify the contractor and the
   ACO promptly so corrective action can be taken. An information copy of the rejection letter to the
   contractor is furnished to the PPCO.
   10.2.6. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity is responsible to submit PTD/SDFP for prepro-
   visioning review prior to release to the other ALCs. PTD will not be released until pre-review has
   been accomplished.

10.3. Supplemental Data for Provisioning (SDFP):
   10.3.1. Drawings will be submitted as specified on the DD Form 1423 IAW DID 81557, develop-
   mental design/product drawings and associated lists, are required for each item appearing on the PTD
   except for those items identified to a government specification or standard which completely
   describes the items. This data is used to assist in item selection (during SMR coding) and later for
   identification, technical review, and cataloging action. Engineering data available during provisioning
   may not always be satisfactory for a complete technical review before purchase and NSN assignment.
       10.3.1.1. In those cases where SDFP is available for only part of the items in the LLIL, the IMS
       ALC will process those items. Items accompanied by correspondence from the contractor stating
       that drawings will be furnished at a later date will be submitted for reference type cataloging.
48                                                                                        30 APRIL 1999

        10.3.1.2. LLIs not accompanied by complete SDFP or correspondence from the contractor will be
        submitted for reference type cataloging if, in the judgment of the IMS ALC, sufficient item data is
        available.
        10.3.1.3. In all instances where SDFP is not submitted with the LLI, the SSM/EAIM ALC will
        obtain the SDFP as soon as possible. SSM/EAIM ALCs who experience any difficulty in obtain-
        ing PTD/SDFP will solicit the ACO's help in getting the necessary documentation. The PPCO will
        be furnished information copies of correspondence concerning the difficulties.
     10.3.2. Procedures for obtaining SDFP (drawings, blueprints, additional characteristic elements)
     required for provisioning purposes, but not received with the applicable PTD, are outlined in Chapter
     22.

10.4. Provisioning Screening. Provisioning screening data is obtained from the DLSC central catalog-
ing files. This data is used to determine the existence/validity of NSNs, prevent unnecessary cataloging
actions, and determine if material managers are assigned. This screening will be accomplished mechani-
cally through the AFMC Provisioning System.

10.5. Processing LLIL:
     10.5.1. The contractor submits LLIL, with SDFP, to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity and
     at the same time will submit SDFP to all other addressees indicated on the CDRL. Upon receipt, the
     Provisioning Activity:
        10.5.1.1. Inspects for completeness and immediately requests missing SDFP via AFMC Form
        784.
        10.5.1.2. Prepares AFMC Form 726, Provisioning Document Control, or uses some other "HQ
        AFMC authorized" method for controlling documents.
        10.5.1.3. Submits PTD/SDFP for preprovisioning review by the cataloging agency, exceptions
        will be documented in the official contract file.
        10.5.1.4. Schedules depot provisioning committee meeting, when appropriate, or prepares PTD
        and SDFP for sequential processing to:
            10.5.1.4.1. Make sure the PTD/SDFP reflects the correct FSCs and item names.
            10.5.1.4.2. Review DLSC screening results, for manual listings, to identify those items
            already stocklisted. Validate management codes assigned to the item, (i.e., IMC, MMAC,
            MOE, etc.). Inserts PICA code in the applicable data block of the PTD.
            10.5.1.4.3. Update the AFMC Provisioning System with the meeting results.
        10.5.1.5. Upon completion of the depot provisioning committee meeting or sequential processing
        to accomplish the above, forwards applicable portions of the PTD and SDFP to the IMS ALC hav-
        ing item manager responsibility for subsequent action, using AFMC Form 773, Provisioning
        Document Transmittal.
        10.5.1.6. Forwards SDFP for consumable items coded for non-Air Force management, to the
        applicable SSR organization (Chapter 26) for preparation of SSRs. Whenever an SSR candidate is
        identified in federal supply group (FSG) 68 or 91, the candidate item(s) are forwarded to
        SA-ALC/SFRM for review. Approval items are forwarded, via SSR prepared by SFRM, to the
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                     49

    applicable integrated materiel manager (IMM). SA-ALC/SFRM notifies the submitting ALC of
    the date of request, resultant action taken codes, and any changes to the SSR.
    10.5.1.7. Prepares AFMC Form 778, Provisioning Document Internal Routing, for internal
    SSM/EAIM ALC processing.
 10.5.2. The SSM/EAIM ALC Equipment Specialist:
     • Establishes SMR codes (TO 00-25-195) and failure factors.
     • Assigns expendability, recoverability, repairability category (ERRC) codes to those items
         source coded in the P" series.
     • Recommends quantities in the case of insurance items.
     • Assigns IMCs to items (selected as spares) new to the Air Force (with or without NSN) IAW
         DOD 4140.26-M.
     • Assigns demilitarization (DEMIL) codes.
     • Assigns MMAC codes as required.
     • Assigns precious metal indicator code (PMIC).
     • Assigns automatic data processing equipment (ADPE) code.
     • Assigns essentiality code (EC)
     • Assigns mission item essentiality code (MIEC).
 10.5.3. The IMS ALC Provisioning Activity processes the PTD and SDFP as follows:
    10.5.3.1. Inspect for completeness. Request drawings, from the SSM/EAIM Provisioning Activ-
    ity, missing or unaccounted for on the AFMC Form 773.
    10.5.3.2. Prepare AFMC Form 726 or use some other "HQ AFMC authorized" routing manage-
    ment control method.
    10.5.3.3. Prepare AFMC Form 778 for internal processing, flow, and control of the PTD and
    SDFP.
    10.5.3.4. Assign NC numbers as required.
    10.5.3.5. Review list for interim released items not managed by the Air Force. Cancel the interim
    release quantity, on those found, using AFMC Form 326, Provisioned Item Order, for manual
    listings, automated PIOs for all others.
    10.5.3.6. Forward items coded for Air Force management to the applicable IMS for PTD and cat-
    aloging action.
    10.5.3.7. Request the IMS annotate in the applicable PTD column the method of support (MOS)
    code, recommended quantity, delivery schedule (when applicable), manager designator code
    (MDC), etc., for all items selected as logical spares.
    10.5.3.8. Upon receipt of processed PTD from the respective IMSs:
        10.5.3.8.1. Review all documents for completeness.
        10.5.3.8.2. Process AF Form 86, SDFP, when applicable, and copy of document to the cata-
        loging function for NSN assignment.
50                                                                                          30 APRIL 1999

            10.5.3.8.3. Enter the updated PTD information into the AFMC Provisioning System and sub-
            mit an annotated copy of the PTD reflecting MOS codes and updates to the SSM/EAIM ALC
            Provisioning Activity.
            10.5.3.8.4. Make sure requests for reduction or cancellations of quantities are quickly pro-
            cessed and sent to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity.
     10.5.4. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity reviews processed PTD for completeness and
     consolidates all buys for submission to the contractor, through the PPCO, setting forth any adjust-
     ments made to the contractors interim releases and recommendations. A marked-up copy of the PTD
     will be sent to the SSM/EAIM for method of support information only when specifically requested by
     the SSM/EAIM.
     10.5.5. Follow time standards in Chapter 19 and Attachment 8.
     10.5.6. Expeditious processing of all LLILs is important since the Air Force must absorb all of the
     contractor's substantiated cancellation costs which result from reductions made to the previously
     authorized interim releases. Further, a delayed reply to LLIL of recommended items may result in the
     contractor's inability to release and fabricate required items in time to meet need dates of the system/
     end article being provisioned. Timely processing of the PTD and SDFP is essential to ensure adequate
     support.
     10.5.7. If the PTD reflects erroneous data, such as SMR code, FSC, or manufacturers P/N, make neat
     and legible corrections in the applicable PTD space (column) for manual listing or update the appro-
     priate field in the Provisioning System.
     10.5.8. Return a marked-up copy of the LLIL to the contractor or insure contractor notification list-
     ings/tapes are output and forwarded to the contractor.
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                        51

                      ACCELERATED PROVISIONING CONCEPT (APC)

11.1. Purpose:
   11.1.1. When sufficient time is not available to use the normal provisioning cycle, APC will be used,
   when justified, to acquire initial spares support.
   11.1.2. APC is a technique for accomplishing portions of the provisioning process, including catalog-
   ing and requirements determinations, on an accelerated basis. Basically, APC is used to help provide
   initial spares support when time is critical by developing and releasing the PIO as part of the provi-
   sioning conference.

11.2. Application:
   11.2.1. APC is adaptable to any method of provisioning.
   11.2.2. The SSM/EAIM ALC will, in conjunction with the applicable SPD, determine when APC
   should be applied.
   11.2.3. Funds availability and attainability must be determined before APC application.

11.3. Procedure:
   11.3.1. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity will maintain a close follow-up with the buying
   activity from the time of coordination on a PR/MIPR requiring development of initial support (provi-
   sioning) until notification is received confirming contract award.
   11.3.2. The establishment of various milestones of the PPS during the guidance conference with the
   contractor should alert the Provisioning Activity if APC is warranted. Coordinate this decision with
   the SPD, if applicable.
   11.3.3. APC will not be applied when sufficient time exists to provision in the normal time cycle;
   however, any slippage being experienced after the guidance conference will be cause for review and
   may necessitate APC application at that time.
   11.3.4. If APC is applied, complete those actions during the provisioning conference pertaining to the
   PIO which are normally taken during and after the provisioning conference.
   11.3.5. If the decision is made to apply APC, the SSM/EAIM ALC will immediately instruct the con-
   tractor to provide the PTD and SDFP, developed for use during the provisioning conference, to the
   SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity not later than 30 days before the conference date. The SSM/
   EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity will immediately process the PTD and output data to the D155 for
   DLSC screening results and CASC/LLGHE-CDL processing.
   11.3.6. The requirement for advance PTD as outlined above will not be waived without prior
   approval of the HQ AFMC Provisioning Branch.
   11.3.7. CASC/LLGHE-CDL will complete their review and process in sufficient time to permit
   updated listings to be made available for use during the provisioning conference. DLSC screening
   results will be used to determine current status as to NSN and management codes, including interpre-
52                                                                                         30 APRIL 1999

     tation on assignment of MOE rule, as appropriate. PICA will be inserted in applicable data block of
     the PTD.
     11.3.8. The provisioning team chairperson will review the PTD and SDFP received under paragraph
     11.3.5 above and, based on the quality of the product, hold the conference as scheduled or postpone
     the conference until acceptable PTD/SDFP can be obtained. Before postponement, the impending
     support date will be considered. The contractor will be advised, through the ACO, of a postponement
     decision. The team chairperson will use the PTD to determine the other ALCs' degree of involvement
     and whether their participation in the provisioning conference is required. Additional guidance as out-
     lined in Chapter 17 of AFMCM 65-33 will be followed.
     11.3.9. The normal provisioning team from the SSM/EAIM ALC will be supplemented, as necessary,
     by the following technicians:
        11.3.9.1. Requirements technicians from IMS ALCs when a significant quantity of items are indi-
        cated for their particular area. An IMS ALC requirements technician may elect to have the SSM/
        EAIM ALC requirements technicians determine the IMS ALC spares requirements when the
        quantity of items does not justify attendance by the individual IMS ALC.
        11.3.9.2. Requirements technicians from the Defense Supply Centers (DSCs). Based on the quan-
        tity of items submitted for management by DLA, the applicable DSC(s) should be contacted and
        encouraged to attend the provisioning conference.
     11.3.10. In addition to the normal actions taken during the conferences, process items SMR coded in
     the "P" series as follows:
        11.3.10.1. Items to be managed by the Air Force:
            11.3.10.1.1. CASC (or, in their absence, the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity) will:
                11.3.10.1.1.1. Review and determine acceptability of those drawings to be subsequently
                used with the post conference list (PCL) for I&S review and cataloging purposes.
                11.3.10.1.1.2. In those cases where additional data are required to satisfy cataloging
                requirements and the provisioning conference is at the contractor's plant, make direct con-
                tact with the applicable prime contractor/vendor to obtain the necessary information.
                These additional required elements of data must be related to the fabrication of the item in
                question and within the standard requirements of the applicable technical data specifica-
                tion and terms of the contracts. When additional information is required and the provision-
                ing conference is at the ALC, prepare AFMC Form 784.
                11.3.10.1.1.3. Make sure the PTD/SDFP reflects the correct FSCs and item names for new
                items.
                11.3.10.1.1.4. Help determine IMC for items (selected as spares) new to the Air Force
                (with or without NSN) IAW DOD 4140.26-M.
                11.3.10.1.1.5. Ensure the true vendor P/N and CAGE code are shown on the drawing and
                PTD.
                11.3.10.1.1.6. Make sure the P/Ns reflected on the PTD/SDFP are constructed IAW DOD
                4100.39M, Volume 2, Chapter 9.
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                      53

          11.3.10.1.1.7. Confer with the contractor regarding use of known military specifications/
          standards items.
          11.3.10.1.1.8. Verify with the equipment specialist the source code on items such as color
          coded or cut lengths of wire, cut lengths of hose/tubing, common cable assemblies, name
          plates, etc, which have been source coded for purchase but which might be more appropri-
          ately coded for local fabrication (new item entry control). However, the final authority for
          the source coding of these items based on technical considerations rests with the equip-
          ment specialist.
          11.3.10.1.1.9. When attending a depot provisioning committee (DPC) conference at an
          ALC, prepare AFMC Form 784 for additional data or data elements required for catalog-
          ing.
          11.3.10.1.1.10. Assign NC numbers to all nonstocklisted items selected and designated
          for Air Force management. Get a block of NC numbers from the applicable FSC IMS ALC
          before the conference.
          11.3.10.1.1.11. Cross reference the designated NC number to the item identification
          which will be submitted to the appropriate FSC ALC after the APC conference.
          11.3.10.1.1.12. The cataloger in attendance at a provisioning conference, either at an ALC
          or the contractor facility, will retain one copy of the PPL pages containing Air Force
          retained items. In addition, one copy of the SDFP will be retained for these items. Hand
          carry these documents to CASC on return for further processing.
       11.3.10.1.2. The IMS will:
          11.3.10.1.2.1. Prior to the conference, provide the PPCO with evidence of sufficient funds
          availability, e.g., a specific dollar amount.
          11.3.10.1.2.2. Determine the initial support requirements IAW AFMCI 23-106 and manu-
          ally prepare the appropriate item worksheets to forward to the applicable IMS ALC after
          the provisioning conference (paragraph 11.3.11.1.3 below). Determining the initial sup-
          port requirements while at the contractors facility can be accomplished by using a laptop
          computer to access RDB/IRD. The RDB/IRD system will be utilized to mechanically pre-
          pare the item worksheets for those conferences held at an ALC.
          11.3.10.1.2.3. Prepare AFMC Forms 326, Provisioned Item Order (PIO) for items with
          a MOS code "1". If the APC is held at the ALC, a mechanized PIO will be generated from
          the AFMC Provisioning System; otherwise, a manual PIO will be prepared for contract
          orders. If the manual PIO procedure is utilized at the conference, the prime ALC provi-
          sioning office will destroy the mechanized PIO output from the AFMC Provisioning Sys-
          tem update to eliminate possible duplicate orders.
          11.3.10.1.2.4. Before the conclusion of the conference, the PIO developed will be
          reviewed, priced (based on the contractor's estimated unit costs), and action taken with the
          PPCO to effect official release to the contractor. This may be done by one of the following
          methods as previously agreed to by the provisioning team chairperson and the PPCO:
                11.3.10.1.2.4.1. Method A: The provisioning team chairperson will contact the PPCO
                at the conclusion of developing the PIO (or incrementally - if mutually agreed upon)
54                                                                                         30 APRIL 1999

                   and furnish the order number, number of items to be bought and estimated dollar value
                   of the PIO to be released. The PPCO may authorize the team chairperson to release the
                   PIO. The PIO thus released will reflect that action has been coordinated with the appli-
                   cable PPCO by annotating the order with the name of the PPCO and the time and date
                   of coordination. The PPCO will issue a priority message covering the PIO. The PIO,
                   reflecting the annotation, will be released to the contractor followed by confirmation
                   with issuance of PIO and SF 30.
                   11.3.10.1.2.4.2. Method B: The PPCO will join the provisioning team just before the
                   close of the conference to effect official release of the PIO.

NOTE:
In the event the aggregate dollar amount of the PIO will exceed $5,000,000, it will be necessary under any
of the above options for the PPCO to prepare and issue RCS: DD-LA(AR)1279, Contract Award
Announcement of Over Five Million Dollars, IAW Air Force FAR Supplement 5.303. Compliance with
this requirement will cause delay not to exceed 5 days in submission/release of PIO to the contractor.
                11.3.10.1.2.5. Provide a copy of the PIOs to the contractor prior to conference completion
                to authorize him to proceed with action to fabricate or order the required items for support.
        11.3.10.2. Items to be managed by other services/agencies:
            11.3.10.2.1. Annual and retail quantities are not developed during the provisioning confer-
            ence for these items.
            11.3.10.2.2. The responsible ALC, upon receipt of the PTD and SDFP after the conference,
            will prepare and submit SSRs or NIMSRs expeditiously.
     11.3.11. Use one of the following methods to notify the IMS ALCs of actions taken during the con-
     ference as well as those actions still to be taken. The team chairperson will decide the method to be
     used on the circumstances prevalent at the time.
        11.3.11.1. Method A: PCL. Under this method, the contractor will be instructed to:
            11.3.11.1.1. Prepare a PCL reflecting all data developed by the provisioning team, including
            such important additional data as quantity placed on order, NC numbers and IMC assigned.
                11.3.11.1.1.1. Prepare and distribute within 21 days following the close of the conference,
                IAW instructions from the provisioning chairperson.
            11.3.11.1.2. Method B: Marking PTD:
                11.3.11.1.2.1. Under this method, the provisioning team chairperson will ensure all
                entries added to the master PTD during the provisioning conference are annotated in a neat
                and legible manner.
                11.3.11.1.2.2. The contractor will be instructed to reproduce and distribute the required
                copies within 5 days after the close of the conference.
            11.3.11.1.3. Regardless of the method used, additional data (such as drawings, item identifi-
            cations, requirements work-sheets, and copies of AFMC Form 326 will accompany the PTD
            when it is distributed to the IMS for information or action as indicated.
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                        55

   11.3.12. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity will prepare a cover letter to furnish the con-
   tractor to be included when the PTD is distributed. The cover letter will clearly state which specific
   actions have been taken and those still required on the part of the IMS ALC. The letter will specify
   that the quantities reflected have been placed on order, and inconsequential quantity/dollar changes
   (plus or minus) should not be made.
   11.3.13. If a laptop computer terminal is to be used to update the AFMC Provisioning System, the
   provisioning team chairperson will prearrange for one of the following methods of communication
   (listed in order of desirability):
       11.3.13.1. Method A: Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS) Line. For provisioning conferences
       held at a government installation or contractor's facility serviced by WATS, arrange with the Base
       Communications Office for priority use on a "no time limit" basis.
       11.3.13.2. Method B: Commercial Line. The provisioning team chairperson should make prior
       arrangements for a credit card.
       11.3.13.3. Method C: Commercial Line. Arrange with the contractor for calls to be placed and
       paid for by the contractor subject to reimbursement by the Government.

11.4. General. I&S review will be made by CASC ersonnel during their review and process of the provi-
sioning data in paragraph 11.3.7. A more detailed, time-consuming element review will be made on an
after-the-fact basis.
56                                                                                          30 APRIL 1999

                              RESIDENT PROVISIONING TEAM (RPT)

12.1. Concept:
     12.1.1. The RPT provides a Provisioning System or portion thereof for new major system/end arti-
     cles. The concept requires selection and assignment of a cadre of well qualified Air Force personnel
     on a permanent change of station (PCS) basis to the contractor's facility to accomplish provisioning,
     or portions thereof. This cadre should be collocated with the contractor's logistics/technical staff to
     obtain firsthand knowledge of system requirements and providing decisions on critical support prob-
     lems. The RILSA, enhanced resident integrated logistics support activity (ERILSA) and logistics sup-
     port cadre (LSC) are an outgrowth of the RPT. The RPT was responsible for provisioning functions
     only; however, the RILSA, ERILSA or LSC are responsible for such things as the maintenance
     improvement project, maintainability and reliability, and provisioning. This chapter relates to the pro-
     visioning function of the RPT.
     12.1.2. The SSM/EAIM ALC commander will provide proper staffing and support for the RPT
     throughout the assigned tour at the contractor's facility. The SSM/EAIM ALC commander will also
     ensure the phase down/out of the RPT is conducted so that adequate personnel are retained at the con-
     tractor's facility until the workload can be readily absorbed by the ALC Provisioning Activity without
     adversely affecting systems support. The RPT will be officially assigned to the SSM organization at
     the ALC.

12.2. Skills Required. Some of the technical skills required for the RPT function include provisioning,
maintenance, cataloging/standardization, requirements, and PPCO specialties. These technical skills may
vary depending on the depth of provisioning effort to be performed by the RPT at the contractor's facility.
Personnel selected for the RPTs must possess in-depth job knowledge in their specialty and be able to
apply such knowledge to satisfy system requirements and resolve problems that may arise. In addition,
these personnel must be able to provide policy and guidance to the contractor in their areas of responsibil-
ity. Functional technicians located with the RPT will perform their duties as prescribed here except as
noted below.

12.3. Procedures:
     12.3.1. Detailed operational procedures may vary between RPTs, but generally procedures for oper-
     ating under an RPT will follow the basic guidelines applied to normal provisioning.
     12.3.2. Specific operating procedures will be developed by the RPT and submitted for review and
     approval by the SSM/EAIM ALC. These procedures will prescribe the responsibilities and operation
     of the RPT to the SSM and IMS ALCs, as well as define documentation flow, processing procedures
     for initial support of spares (including support of SE), and related functions. Procedures will be bind-
     ing on all ALCs.

12.4. Provisioning Performance Schedule. The RPT will use AFMC Form 718 as a guide in develop-
ing applicable PPS.

                         DEPOT PROVISIONING COMMITTEE (DPC)

13.1. General. DPC Method. The DPC conferences are conducted by and held at the SSM/EAIM/RIIM
ALC. This method is also known within the Air force as the in house method. Contractor participation
will be specified by the Provisioning Activity.

13.2. Policy:
   13.2.1. The DPC method as outlined here is used when size and complexity of the end article of the
   PTD, that is, LLIL, PPL, incremental submission, or RIL, does not justify conducting a provisioning
   conference at the contractor's/vendor's facility.
   13.2.2. A DPC may be established for each system/end article. Full recognition must be given to the
   value of continuity of membership throughout the provisioning phase.
   13.2.3. The DPC is scheduled by the SSM/EAIM/RIIM ALC Provisioning Activity to convene IAW
   established time cycles and after receipt and evaluation of the PTD/SDFP.
   13.2.4. The DPC will select the initial range of spares, assign technical and management codes, and
   occasionally determine quantitative requirements for initial support of the system/end article being
   provisioned.
   13.2.5. The DPC meeting may be established to:
       13.2.5.1. Accomplish complete processing of the PTD including submission of the PIO; or:
       13.2.5.2. Accomplish support item selection and assignment of technical and management codes
       with the PTD to be processed through the system as outlined in Chapter 10 or 15.

13.3. Committee Membership. The DPC membership will be held to the absolute minimum. Number
and type of members may vary depending upon the type of PTD being processed and the extent to which
the PTD is to be processed by the DPC. The DPC will consist of fully qualified personnel generally from
the following ALC functions:
    • Provisioning Activity (mandatory).
    • Engineering and Reliability Branch (mandatory).
    • IMSs (when required).
    • Production Management Branch.
    • Packaging and Materials Handling Branch.
    • Contractors and using command(s) representation, may be included when required.

13.4. Procedures:
   13.4.1. The Provisioning Activity, upon receipt of PTD/SDFP will:
       13.4.1.1. Establish and maintain prescribed management controls. AFMC Form 726, or other HQ
       AFMC authorized method may be used.
58                                                                                       30 APRIL 1999

        13.4.1.2. Advise the various representatives indicating actions required for the meeting and the
        place, date, and time of the meeting.
        13.4.1.3. When the engineering and reliability branch requests product directorate maintenance
        (TRC) representatives, notify the applicable directorate of the requirement.
        13.4.1.4. Act as chairperson.
        13.4.1.5. Mark up master copy of the PTD in coordination with representatives present by enter-
        ing additions/changes in a neat and legible manner making no unnecessary markings or annota-
        tions. Make markings legible so as to facilitate reproduction, when required.
        13.4.1.6. Perform the duties normally accomplished by CASC during a provisioning conference.
     13.4.2. Engineering and Reliability Branch representative will perform provisioning conference
     duties including, but not limited to assignment of SMR codes and maintenance factors, acting as con-
     ference co-chairperson, etc.
     13.4.3. IMSs will generally be required only in the event PIO is to be released as a part of the DPC
     meeting and will:
        13.4.3.1. Determine initial requirements for prime items.
        13.4.3.2. Review and establish or approve firm unit pack quantities IAW criteria established in
        MIL-STD-2073, in coordination with engineering and reliability branch and packaging and mate-
        rials handling branch representatives. Make sure the established and approved unit pack quantities
        are reflected in appropriate property class records.
        13.4.3.3. Establish MOS for prime items. Prepare AFMC Form 326, when applicable.
        13.4.3.4. Record the NC number assigned by the ALC Provisioning Activity. This number will
        not be furnished by any other method.
     13.4.4. Production management branch representatives, when in attendance, will accomplish the
     responsibilities as assigned for a provisioning conference.
     13.4.5. Packaging and materials handling branch representatives, when in attendance, will accom-
     plish the responsibilities as assigned for a provisioning conference.
     13.4.6. Using commands representatives, when in attendance, will follow the actions outlined in
     Chapter 14.
     13.4.7. The Provisioning Activity, upon completion of the DPC meeting, will:
        13.4.7.1. Review PTD for action by any other ALCs. If other ALCs are involved, the PTD/SDFP
        will be transmitted by AFMC Form 773 for action IAW the specific type of PTD, such as LLIL
        and RIL. The IMS ALCs will process the PTD/SDFP (paragraph 10.5.3.1 through 10.5.3.7 as
        applicable).
        13.4.7.2. Any additional internal processing of the PTD/SDFP will require preparation of AFMC
        Form 778/773 (paragraphs 10.5.3.3 through 10.5.3.7 as applicable).
        13.4.7.3. Send annotated copy of the PTD or automated contractor notification products to the
        contractor or to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity as appropriate, for inclusion of the
        SMR codes in the IPB.
  30 APRIL 1999                                                                                                                                    59

                                                PROVISIONING CONFERENCE

14.1. General:
   14.1.1. The provisioning conference provides for the Government to make item selection and assign
   technical and management codes (previously referred to within the Air force as a source coding con-
   ference). The following resources will normally be used:
         14.1.1.1. Sample articles when specified in the IPPS.
         14.1.1.2. Provisioning technical documentation/SUPPLEMENTAL data for provisioning (PTD/
         SDFP).
         14.1.1.3. Maintenance engineering analysis (MEA), and/or RLA, when a requirement of the con-
         tract.
         14.1.1.4. Competent personnel with expert technical knowledge of the system/end article with
         regard to the design, reliability and maintenance characteristics of the system/end article or the
         portion being provisioned.
   14.1.2. It is imperative that only personnel well qualified in their technical specialty attend provision-
   ing conferences and that continuity of personnel be maintained throughout. Keep representatives to a
   minimum. In all cases, representatives must be authorized to make commitments for their activity.
   14.1.3. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity will prepare a tentative schedule of guidance and
   provisioning conferences on RCS: MTC-LG-(Q)8126, Quarterly Guidance/Provisioning Conference
   Projections, in the format shown in Figure 14-1.

14.2. Responsibilities:
     14.2.1. Provisioning Activity - SSM/EAIM ALC:
        14.2.1.1. Schedules, administers, and coordinates all provisioning conference actions.
        14.2.1.2. Assures that the contractor forwards one copy of the SDFP to the cataloging activity at
        least 60 days prior to the provisioning conference. Forwards the appropriate PTD to the D155 for
        all provisioning, including desk top (in-house) provisioning. The PTD must be sent at least 60
        days in advance of all scheduled provisioning conferences. This will allow the cataloging activity
        sufficient time for their necessary review and preparation prior to the provisioning conference.
        Such review will reveal the deficiencies in the data that otherwise are not normally found until the
        conference convenes. However, if a 30-day review is not possible, due to the late receipt of the
        data from the contractor, it then becomes the responsibility of the Provisioning Activity to inform
        the cataloging activity. Such action will allow the cataloging activity time to inform the applicable
        ALC if the less than minimum allotted time for the review is acceptable. This should be done on a
        case-by-case basis. If the decision by the cataloging activity is that more time is needed, the provi-
        sioning conference should be delayed. Such delays must not be too extensive that they jeopardize
        system support required by the OND. A two (2) to three (3) week delay is usually acceptable.
            14.2.1.2.1. When CASC has completed their review and has updated the D155, the D155 will
            mechanically update the AFMC Provisioning System. An updated PTD listing will be gener-

14.3. Procedures:
     14.3.1. Preplanning. Accomplish the following at the guidance conference:
        14.3.1.1. Scheduling of Provisioning Conference. Dates for and location of the provisioning con-
        ference will be established as recommended by the contractor and approved by the SSM/EAIM
        ALC Provisioning Activity. Although it is desirable that the provisioning conference be com-
        pleted as quickly as possible, support item selection and technical and management codes must be
        accurately assigned. Therefore, the schedule established will be used for planning purposes. The
        chairperson will ensure all conferees devote their full attention to their respective functions and
        responsibilities. Conferees should not be held to a set compulsory schedule that must be met each
        day when such a schedule might result in hastily assigned inaccurate technical and management
        codes.
        14.3.1.2. Facilities and Equipment:
            14.3.1.2.1. A conference room large enough to accommodate all representatives and the sam-
            ple articles for the duration of the conference.

NOTE:
The contractor is responsible for ensuring the availability of sample articles if specified in the contract by
coordinating this requirement with all affected departments within his own facility prior to the confer-
ence.
            14.3.1.2.2. Inform the contractor of the requirements for and arrangement of tables, file cabi-
            nets, etc.
        14.3.1.3. Documentation Required:
            14.3.1.3.1. SDFP:

 14.3.2. Organization:
    14.3.2.1. SMR Coding Tables. The number of SMR coding tables depends upon the complexity
    of the system/end article being coded. These tables will be segregated by engineering section
    order and presided over by a technical service/equipment specialist of the applicable product
    Directorate and a contractor design engineer responsible for the section/system being SMR coded.
    The following is an example of a breakdown for an aircraft meeting: Tables 1 and 2 - fuselage
    structures, flight controls, control surfaces, etc. Table 3 - wing structures and nacelles. Table 4 -
    air-conditioning, pressurization, hydraulic, oxygen, pneumatic, fuel and oil systems, landing gear
    and brakes, etc. Table 5 - radio, communication, electronics, electrical instruments, etc.
    14.3.2.2. Review Tables. The review tables allow the production management, production con-
    trol, and using command representatives to review the SMR codes assigned and to ensure that all
    parts have been SMR coded. Representatives at these tables will be available to the SMR coding
    tables when needed. Disagreements with any technical and management codes assigned will be
    reviewed for a final decision.

        14.3.3.3. Comments for minutes. (Chairperson will ensure all comments documented by partici-
        pants and any problems encountered during the conference are included in the minutes.
     14.3.4. Operating Procedures:
        14.3.4.1. ES responsibilities
            14.3.4.1.1. The supplemental drawings and other PTD (specifications, vendor drawings, com-
            mercial data) will be provided in P/N or PLISN sequence, as specified by contract.
            14.3.4.1.2. The ALC ES SMR coding, will begin with the first top-assembly drawing of the
            section under review and assign the appropriate SMR code, maintenance factors, and other
            applicable codes and rates. IAW AFMCI 23-106, factors developed by the contractor will not
            be changed by the ES without complete justification. Under no circumstances will any
            changes be made to contractor furnished maintenance replacement rates (MRRs) by the ES if
            the factors were developed as part of a reliability and maintainability program unless there is a
            change in mission or maintenance concept. Such changes require the approval of the SPD. The
            MRR should always represent the latest information available (i.e., test data, design change
            information, a like item experience, etc.). The ES must notify the end article system manager
            of their intent to deviate significantly (i.e., plus or minus 10%) from contractor estimated fail-
            ure rates on major systems or subsystems being provisioned.

NOTE:
The ES has final authority on SMR code assignments but must retain all supportive documentation justi-
fying changes to the factors for a minimum of three years.
            14.3.4.1.3. The ES will check the parts list of each drawing and will:
                14.3.4.1.3.1. Verify that each applicable item from the drawing is present on the provi-
                sioning document in the correct quantity.
                14.3.4.1.3.2. Assign appropriate codes and factors to each detail part based on the estab-
                lished maintenance concept and review of detail drawings, vendor drawings, specifica-
                tions, or commercial data.
            14.3.4.1.4. The ERRC codes will be assigned to all items with a "P" in the first position of the
            SMR code. With the exception of insurance items, all "P" coded items will be assigned main-
            tenance/overhaul factors.
            14.3.4.1.5. Codes, factors and quantities will be reexamined for each occurrence of multiple
            application items to ensure that accurate data is entered at the first occurrence.
            14.3.4.1.6. Where applicable, the ALC ES along with other participants, will review the com-
            mon/bulk item list (CBIL) and assign SMR code, maintenance factors, and other applicable
            codes. They must determine whether appearances of those CBIL items on previous lists has
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                      67

       satisfied total weapon system requirements. If so, ensure that MOS coding and quantity passed
       to the SSR system will not duplicate those requirements.
       14.3.4.1.7. ISSL candidates will be identified as applicable.
       14.3.4.1.8. Drawings for items SMR coded "M__" will be reviewed to ensure that:
          14.3.4.1.8.1. Manufacture of the item is within the capabilities of the depot, intermediate
          or organizational level shop.
          14.3.4.1.8.2. Required raw or semi-fabricated material is identified for procurement by
          the IMS ALC or inclusion in the technical order (TO).
          14.3.4.1.8.3. special tooling or test equipment (ST/STE) required for manufacture is iden-
          tified for procurement and inclusion in the TO.
       14.3.4.1.9. The cognizant design and field service engineers will be available to advise the ES
       on maintenance practices and field reliability experience.
       14.3.4.1.10. Sample articles (if required in the contract) will be disassembled/reviewed as
       deemed necessary by the equipment specialist.
    14.3.4.2. Using command review table when required:
       14.3.4.2.1. The drawings will be received in section order.
       14.3.4.2.2. The using command representatives will review all drawings to ensure that:
           • The extent of repair is economically and technically feasible at the user level.
           • The selection of SE, the range of spare parts selected, and the SMR coding are in line
               with the scope of maintenance established at the using command.
          14.3.4.2.2.1. Field units have the capabilities to manufacture, assemble, repair, test and
          install, as applicable.

                                         PROVISIONING LISTS

15.1. First Article Acceptance. When a requirement for first article acceptance, chapter 3, paragraph
1.10, is applicable to the contract, provisioning actions will be governed by the existence of one of the fol-
lowing conditions:
     15.1.1. Contractor does not have contractual authority for spares production release pending first arti-
     cle approval. This is a normal condition which should apply in most instances. Acquisition of materi-
     als or components or start of production without government approval is at the sole risk of the
     contractor.
     15.1.2. When the above is applicable, interim release provisions of the IPPS, attachment 2, form do
     not apply before first article approval. PTD/SDFP may be processed and AFMC Forms 326, Provi-
     sioned Item Order (with Delivery Schedule), and other documents for SSR requirements can be pre-
     pared based on lead-time and need date considerations. However, PIOs whether manual or automated
     will not be sent to the PPCO or SSRs submitted until the first article is approved.
     15.1.3. As an exception to the above, in some cases the contractor may have been provided authority
     for production release before first article approval IAW the provisions of FAR(DAR)9.305:
        15.1.3.1. In this event, interim release authority applies for items and quantities required to sup-
        port the end article released. PTD for interim released items must be processed and the PIO
        released to the contractor within established time limits regardless of whether the first article test
        and approval has been completed.
        15.1.3.2. PTD/SDFP on items requiring SSR preparation will be sent to the SSR organization for
        SSR submission and will be limited to those items necessary to ensure spares support for the end
        articles.

15.2. Provisioning Parts List (PPL):
     15.2.1. The PPL must contain all components, assemblies, and support items which can be disassem-
     bled, reassembled or replaced, which, when combined, constitute the end item. The only exception
     being items identified as GFP or items identified on a SPS for which the Government has determined
     that PTD is not required. The PPL must contain all tools and test equipment required to maintain the
     end item unless an exclusion statement is included in the IPPS, attachment 2.
     15.2.2. Simultaneously with the progressive submission and processing of the LLILs, the contractor
     must develop and prepare the PPL as directed by the Provisioning Activity in the IPPS.
     15.2.3. Incremental submission of a sizable PPL is encouraged, provided that such increments com-
     prise no less than the requirements of a complete component. The PPL and all incremental submis-
     sions will always be supported with required SDFP previously described, including screening data
     when appropriate.
     15.2.4. All LLILs submitted will have been completely processed and the results reflected in the PPL.

15.3. Processing PPL:
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                         69

   15.3.1. When all LLILs have been processed, the contractor should complete and send the PPL with
   required SDFP, to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity and other identified CDRL pre-review-
   ing activities. Submission of the PPL is required 60 days in advance of the scheduled provisioning
   conference to allow CASC, DLA and the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity time for a pre-con-
   ference review.
   15.3.2. The PPL or incremental submissions thereof, may be processed in either of the following
   methods depending on mutual agreements made during the guidance conference:
      15.3.2.1. RPT Method. The support item selection and assignment of technical and management
      codes are accomplished at the RPT site as outlined in Chapter 12.
      15.3.2.2. DPC (In-house) Method. The support item selection and assignment of technical and
      management codes are accomplished at the SSM/EAIM ALC as outlined in Chapter 13.
      15.3.2.3. Conference Team Method. The provisioning conference is held at the contractors facil-
      ity to accomplish the actions outlined in Chapter 14.

15.4. Method of Support (MOS) Code:
   15.4.1. For each line item selected as a potential spare, one of the following MOS codes will be anno-
   tated by the IMS in the appropriate block of the PTD. Reflecting the MOS code in this manner will
   provide information on IMS supportability of the individual item:
       • Code 0 - Not being bought at this time on production contract. Often used to pass information.
       • Code 1 - Being bought on production contract.
       • Code 2 - Being bought by IMS through PR/MIPR.
       • Code 3 - Immediate purchase not required.
       • Code 4 - Nonconsumable item (Air Force ERRC of XD_, ND2, or NF2) being managed by
           another military service. Supply support will be obtained IAW AFMCR 400-21 procedures.
           MOS 4 is assigned mechanically during the technical review file maintenance update.
       • Code 5 - Breakout item being purchased from the actual manufacturer by the IMS with a PR.
       • Code 6 - Other agency/service integrated managed item. SSR is being processed in D169.
       • Code 7 - Breakout item being purchased from the actual manufacturer with a PIO on a vendor-
           contract.
       • Code 8 - Reserved.

15.5. Method Of Support (MOS) Code Modifier:
   15.5.1. This code is to identify RIB and substitute item status and must be used in conjunction with an
   MOS code. The user, i.e., IMS, ES, Using Activity, will assign an MOS Modifier Code in the appro-
   priate data field of the PTD work document when applicable.
   15.5.2. Method of Support Code Modifier (MM):
      • A - Request RIB.
      • B - RIB available.
      • C - Substitute item will be furnished.
70                                                                                          30 APRIL 1999

     15.5.3. The above procedure applies only to mechanized provisioning.

15.6. Repairable Item List (RIL):
     15.6.1. The RIL is a list of those support items of a repairable nature used in the end item, component
     or assembly.
     15.6.2. The RIL is prepared by the contractor and submitted to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning
     Activity as early in the provisioning process as possible.
     15.6.3. The RIL is circulated by the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity to involved ALCs to
     determine the need for any RIB.
     15.6.4. The contractor must be advised of RIB requirements as early as possible so that spare/repair
     parts will be available by the OND.

15.7. Recoverable Items breakdown (RIB):
     15.7.1. The RIB, a supplemental PPL, is an all-inclusive breakdown used for support item selection
     and assignment of technical and management codes. The breakdown for recoverable type items will
     be requested, as required, at the time of initial review of a provisioning list. The contractor should be
     asked to provide this information within 60 days after receipt of request or on a date mutually agreed
     to between the contractor and the ALC Provisioning Activity.
     15.7.2. A RIB received before or after the provisioning conference will be processed in the same
     manner as a PPL, whether the management responsibility for the recoverable item is that of the SSM/
     EAIM ALC or RIIM ALC. The RIIM ALC will assume the same responsibilities in processing these
     breakdowns as outlined previously for the SSM/EAIM ALC for a PPL. Manual provisioning efforts
     mandate that since AFMC Forms 326 are not forwarded to the RIIM ALC by the supporting IMS
     ALCs involved, the AFMC Form 773 prepared to transmit the RIB and SDFP to the IMS ALCs will
     show the applicable SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity in block 4. Each IMS ALC involved will
     furnish the RIIM ALC an information copy of the endorsed AFMC Form 773 used to send AFMC
     Forms 326 to the SSM/EAIM ALC. AFMC Forms 326 prepared by IMSs at the RIIM ALC will be
     sent to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity through the local Provisioning Activity.

15.8. Post Conference List (PCL).
     15.8.1. The PCL will list all items selected as logical spares at the provisioning conference and those
     items previously selected as logical spares to which changes were made during the conference. The
     appropriate use of this type of listing would be for contracts using manual provisioning, when a
     RILSA is involved, or for FMS efforts.
     15.8.2. The contractor must prepare and submit the PCL, complete with the SDFP, as soon as possi-
     ble, but not later than 21 days after completion of the provisioning conference. In no event will the
     time limit be such that receipt of items by the operational need date is jeopardized.
     15.8.3. The PCLs are to be submitted by the contractor to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activ-
     ity. Upon receipt of the PTD/SDFP, the ALC Provisioning Activity will:
        15.8.3.1. Inspect for completeness. Request missing drawings via AFMC Form 784.
        15.8.3.2. Prepare AFMC Form 726, manual or automated.
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                       71

      15.8.3.3. Forward applicable portions of the PTD/SDFP to the IMS ALCs having item manage-
      ment responsibility for subsequent action. Transmit by AFMC Form 773.
      15.8.3.4. Prepare AFMC Form 778 for internal SSM/EAIM ALC processing as outlined previ-
      ously in paragraphs 10.5.3.4 through 10.5.3.8.1 except for 10.5.3.5.
   15.8.4. The IMS ALCs will process the PTD/SDFP as previously outlined in paragraphs 10.5.3.1
   through 10.5.3.8 except for 10.5.3.5.
   15.8.5. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity will review processed PTD for completeness and
   consolidate all AFMC Forms 326/Automated PIOs for submission to the contractor through the
   PPCO.
   15.8.6. Time standards established in Chapter 19 and Attachment 8 are to be followed.

15.9. Design Change Notice (DCN):
   15.9.1. The DCN is the type of PTD used by the contractor to notify the SSM/EAIM ALC Provision-
   ing Activity of all engineering changes, whether of a production or modification type, which are
   approved for incorporation into the end item on contract and which modify, add to, delete, or super-
   sede parts in the end item or its supporting equipment.
   15.9.2. DCNs fall into two categories:
      15.9.2.1. DCNs resulting from an approved engineering change proposal (ECP).
      15.9.2.2. Non-ECP changes resulting from omission or correction of data submitted by the con-
      tractor. These changes are considered administrative change notices (ACNs) and must not be
      labeled as DCNs. ACNs will be handled in one of the following ways:
          15.9.2.2.1. The first method is the submittal of the change. The reason for the change will be
          identified in the remarks block or the extended remarks block.
          15.9.2.2.2. If authorized by the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity, the second method is
          the submittal of a letter from the contractor to the ALC Provisioning Activity describing the
          corrections to be made. The Provisioning Activity will be responsible for making the correc-
          tions to the item record in the AFMC Provisioning System.
   15.9.3. All DCNs will be accompanied by applicable SDFP and submitted by the contractor IAW the
   following time schedules:
      15.9.3.1. Within 21 calendar days after release for fabrication or purchase for prime contractor
      design items.
      15.9.3.2. Within 42 calendar days after release for fabrication and purchase for subtier supplier
      design items.
   15.9.4. The contractor will submit all DCNs to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity. Gener-
   ally, DCN processing will be similar to LLIL processing. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity
   when submitting DCNs to the responsible RIIM ALC for assignment of technical and management
   codes, will include NSN or FSC and P/N of the recoverable item on an AFMC Form 773.
   15.9.5. When type of change code (TOCC) D is submitted on a DCN, the contractor is responsible for
   submitting the required data element information based on the most recently received contractor noti-
   fication received for the item.
72                                                                                          30 APRIL 1999

     15.9.6. When a design change reduces or eliminates support item requirements for the end item com-
     ponent, the contractor shall delete or reduce such requirements originally ordered by a PIO in the ratio
     authorized by the program data applicable to the end items on order that are affected by the design
     change.
     15.9.7. When a support item previously ordered by the Government is replaced by another item, the
     contractor shall fabricate or procure the new item in the same ratio as the number of end items/compo-
     nents affected by the change within the previously authorized funding limitations. When the adjust-
     ment requires an increase in the total quantity recommended or any additional items of support, the
     increase will be recommended by the contractor in accordance with program data provided by the Pro-
     visioning Activity. Therefore, as the result of a DCN submittal, the contractor should not delay pro-
     duction on the items affected by the change while awaiting receipt of another PIO. The contractor is
     to continue production of the new configuration within the designated funding authorization without
     the PIO.
     15.9.8. The contractor shall establish positive internal communications between his engineering and
     logistic personnel to assure that the latest technical and hardware configuration data are used in the
     preparation of PTD and SDFP and that changes are made concurrently with DCN requirements.

15.10. Common and Bulk Items List (CBIL):
     15.10.1. The CBIL contains items of common hardware such as common nuts, bolts, screws, keys,
     washers, and fittings, except those of special design. The CBIL can also contain bulk items such as
     electrical wire and cable, gasket material, tubing, hose, adhesives, paints, oil, grease, solvents, and
     metal stock (such as rods and sheets).
     15.10.2. The CBIL is prepared by the contractor and may be submitted to the SSM/EAIM ALC Pro-
     visioning Activity together with the PPL.
     15.10.3. The CBIL is not subject to the normal support item selection and assignment of technical
     and management code process; however, to accommodate requirements of automatic data processing
     equipment operated logistics systems, the source code "PA" will be assigned to government and com-
     mercial standard items when these items are predicted for maintenance use. In addition, recommended
     quantity/factor will be indicated for all items (except FSGs 53 and 59) SMR coded "PA".
     15.10.4. Only those items on the CBIL reflecting a SMR code "PA" and/or having a recommended
     quantity/factor will be extracted from the CBIL and placed on a PCL for further action IAW process-
     ing instructions contained in this chapter.
     15.10.5. Common hardware items such as common nuts, bolts, screws, keys, washers and fittings will
     not be submitted on the CBIL if the IPPS, attachment 2, calls for the delivery of a PPL in a topdown
     breakdown. When the PPL is a requirement, all hardware litems will appear on the PPL, not on the
     CBIL.

15.11. Tools and Test Equipment List (TTEL):
     15.11.1. The TTEL contains those support items that are not an integral part of an end item, but are
     required to inspect, test, calibrate, service, repair, or overhaul an end item.
     15.11.2. The TTEL may be part of the PPL or it may be received as a separate listing. The type and
     complexity of the end item should be the determining factor.
  30 APRIL 1999                                                                                          73

   15.11.3. When Support Equipment Recommendation Data (SERD) is incorporated in the contract,
   the TTEL is not applicable.

15.12. Short Form Provisioning Parts List (SFPPL):
   15.12.1. The SFPPL contains only those support items recommended by the contractor for mainte-
   nance of the end item.
   15.12.2. This document provides simplified procedures for the provisioning of articles of simple
   design and technical order (modifications requiring initial spares which do not require the use of
   detailed group assembly breakdown documentation).
   15.12.3. The SFPPL is prepared by the contractor and submitted to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provision-
   ing Activity. The SFPPL will be accompanied by applicable SDFP and processed within the same
   time frames and procedures as a PPL.

15.13. Manufacturers or Commercial Manual: This manual supplements the SFPPL and is used to
determine the range and quantity of support items required to maintain the end item for an initial period of
service.

15.14. Initial Spares Support List (ISSL) Items:
   15.14.1. The ISSL is a list that is developed and used to lay in stock at the base level to support the
   activation of a new weapon system or equipment.
   15.14.2. To control the timely development of the ISSL, take the following actions:
       15.14.2.1. When the applicable programming checklist indicates requirements for an ISSL, the
       SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity will check with the system program end article manager,
       or RIIM to determine and identify the specific organization which develops the ISSL. The Provi-
       sioning Activity will load this information into the POP which will establish the ISSL monitor and
       focal point in the AFMC Provisioning System.
       15.14.2.2. Requirements identified by the using command(s) during the provisioning conference
       will be forwarded to the ISSL monitor via conference minutes. This will help the ISSL monitor to
       ensure individual AFMC Forms 408 are accounted for.
       15.14.2.3. For PTD that is input into the AFMC Provisioning System, all ALC managed items
       identified as being ISSL candidates the system will automatically generate an AFMC Form 408
       with the applicable ISSL monitor's office symbol annotated on the form. Forward this data along
       with the PTD and any SDFP to the IMS for normal processing. Indicate in the remarks block on
       the transmittal form that the IMS is to complete and coordinate with the ES the AFMC Form 408
       and forward the results on to the designated ISSL monitor. For all DLA items identified as valid
       ISSL candidates, the SSM is responsible for completing and submitting a manual AFMC Form
       408 to the ISSL monitor for file maintenance of the D040 ISSL system. (AFM 67-1, Vol I, Part
       One, Chapter 12).
       15.14.2.4. Manual provisioning requires that the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity for-
       wards one copy of all PTD that reflects ISSL items to the ISSL monitor indicating in the remark
       block of the transmittal that "this data is to be used only in the development of the ISSL". The IMS
74                                                                                     30 APRIL 1999

        is to complete and coordinate with the ES the AFMC Form 408 and forwarding the results on to
        the designated ISSL monitor.

15.15. Receipt/Acceptance - Material Inspection and Receiving Report, DD Form 250:
     15.15.1. The contractor prepares the DD Form 250 for provisioning data listed on the CDRLs which
     require government inspection and acceptance (per DoDI 5000.2, AF Sup 1). Submission of the DD
     Form 250 may actually accompany the shipment of PTD/SDFP or may be mailed separately by the
     contractor at a later date. The following actions are applicable when "inspection and acceptance at
     destination" is indicated.
        15.15.1.1. When the DD Form 250 accompanies the shipment of PTD/SDFP, the Provisioning
        Activity will:
            15.15.1.1.1. Inspect the PTD/SDFP.
            15.15.1.1.2. Suspense the DD Form 250 until processing of the PTD has been completed,
            including receipt of any missing SDFP from the original submission. See chapter 22, Provi-
            sioning Technical Data Requirements System (PROTECDARS).
            15.15.1.1.3. Upon complete processing of the applicable PTD and all required SDFP, remove
            the DD Form 250 from suspense and process it for signature.
        15.15.1.2. When the DD Form 250 is received subsequent to receipt of applicable PTD/SDFP, the
        Provisioning Activity will:
            15.15.1.2.1. Check files and records to determine receipt of all data listed on the DD Form
            250. This will include checking suspense files maintained under PROTECDARS to ensure all
            applicable SDFP requests have been completely and satisfactorily processed.
            15.15.1.2.2. Process DD Form 250 for signature only if records indicate data received was
            complete and satisfactory. If otherwise, return the DD Form 250 unsigned to the contractor
            with appropriate explanation.
     15.15.2. The DD Form 250 helps ensure that the contractor has fully complied with contractual
     requirements for submission of complete PTD/SDFP.
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                        75

                  SOURCE, MAINTENANCE, RECOVERABILITY (SMR) CODES

16.1. Principles:
   16.1.1. Assign SMR codes to all items which make up or are used in the construction of a system or
   equipment.
   16.1.2. The equipment specialist assigns the SMR codes (alpha codes) during the acquisition of the
   system/end article.
   16.1.3. SMR codes portray the maintenance decisions made by the equipment specialist and are used
   to communicate these decisions to various logistics offices (both contractor and Air Force).
   16.1.4. Detailed principles and policies are contained in TO 00-25-195.

16.2. Policies:
   16.2.1. The SMR codes inform the user of the complete method of maintenance support by:
       16.2.1.1. Indicating the manner of acquiring items for the maintenance, repair, reconditioning, or
       overhaul of end items.
       16.2.1.2. Indicating the maintenance levels authorized to perform the required maintenance func-
       tion.
       16.2.1.3. Indicating the disposition action on unserviceable support items.
   16.2.2. The assignment of SMR codes are normally accomplished during a provisioning conference,
   previously referred to as a source coding conference. The purpose of a provisioning conference is for
   the Air Force to make support item selection and assign technical and management codes. Any
   changes to SMR codes after a provisioning conference and prior to publication of the IPB are to be
   documented in writing to the prime Provisioning Activity for processing and notifying the contractor
   of the changes.

16.3. Application:
   16.3.1. The procedures defined in above references and outlined here apply to all Air Force systems/
   end articles bought for operational requirements. The chairperson of the provisioning conference
   ensures required technical data is available and SMR codes are applied to the complete range of items
   of the system/end article under review.
   16.3.2. The vendor or prime contractor recoverable assembly line item will be SMR coded by the
   SSM/EAIM ALC when such items are bought as a component on an end article contract. Subassem-
   blies and detail parts of the recoverable assembly line item will then be SMR coded by the RIIM ALC
   having prime responsibility for the recoverable item. The RIIM ALC will accomplish SMR coding
   upon receipt of the breakdown for the recoverable assembly or at the provisioning conference for the
   end article, whichever comes first. Management coded documents will be immediately furnished to
   the SSM/EAIM ALC for forwarding to the contractor(s) for inclusion in applicable IPB(s).
76                                                                                         30 APRIL 1999

     16.3.3. In those instances where detail drawings and/or other technical data required to accomplish
     SMR coding are not available, the SSM/EAIM ALC responsible for the end item or contract will
     ensure that documentation required is obtained and furnished to the appropriate RIIM ALC.

16.4. Parts Kits. The policies and procedures for the selection of parts kits are outlined in AFMCMAN
25-1.

16.5. Benefits:
     16.5.1. Provides an effective method of identifying spares to support the system/end article.
     16.5.2. Identifies the level(s) of maintenance authorized to perform required maintenance functions.
     16.5.3. Establishes the base line from which all support requirements can be developed.
     16.5.4. Indicates the disposition action on unserviceable items.
     16.5.5. Creates an efficient communication device reflecting maintenance information for all items
     within a system/end article.

16.6. Structure. There are two SMR coding structures currently in use within the Air Force. "Joint Mili-
tary Services" Uniform SMR codes will be applied to all Air Force systems and materiel for which a con-
tract was awarded after 1 July 1972 for new operational requirements (TO 00-25-195). These codes will
replace, on an evolutionary basis, the "In-Being" codes.

16.7. Updating and Changing. To provide logistics support by the OND, LLILs require early SMR
maintenance and overhaul code assignments. This is accomplished before the provisioning conference.
The conference provides the ES with the opportunity to review these early decisions in context with the
total range of support decisions. Where possible, the ES should adjust these early decisions to reflect cur-
rent conditions. Changes in operational requirements, design changes, or quantity of end items being
bought must be considered and, where feasible, technical decisions adjusted.

16.8. Matrixes: The two SMR coding matrixes are:

                       BREAKOUT PROCEDURES FOR INITIAL SPARES

17.1. Objective. The objective of this procedure is to reduce cost by procuring new, Air Force managed
initial spares directly from the actual manufacturer while maintaining the integrity of the system in which
the parts are to be used. In this regulation, actual manufacturer is defined as the manufacturer having the
design control responsibility of the part. Breakout for competitive procurement is not applicable to initial
spares unless two or more actual manufacturers are recommended by the prime contractor and it is cost
effective.

17.2. Application:
   17.2.1. This policy applies if the prime contractor recommends that items be procured directly from
   the actual manufacturer or enough information is available to make a responsible management deci-
   sion that breakout will be cost effective and will not degrade the Air Force mission. Items suited for
   direct purchase are those that meet all of the following criteria:
       17.2.1.1. SMR coded for procurement.
       17.2.1.2. Nonstocklisted or still in initial support period.
       17.2.1.3. Not actually manufactured by the prime contractor and no value is added by the prime.
       Value added may include: testing, inspection, engineering review of specifications, configuration
       management, quality assurance, serialization, tracking, packing, etc.
       17.2.1.4. Weapon system oriented (service managed). Application of IMC criteria is vital to
       assure only appropriate items are retained for Air Force management.
       17.2.1.5. Considered to be design stable.
       17.2.1.6. Data belongs to the actual manufacturer who exercises total responsibility for the part.
       17.2.1.7. Total procurement leadtime to the actual manufacturer is not beyond the need date or is
       not considered detrimental to support.
       17.2.1.8. Items that can be bought more economically from vendor.
       17.2.1.9. Warranties will not be violated/nullified/voided if the item is procured from the actual
       manufacturer.
   17.2.2. Urgency of need, configuration stability and control, system warranties and cost analysis can
   influence the decision to acquire spares from the prime contractor or actual manufacturer.
   17.2.3. Initial spares breakout applies to all provisioning acquisitions including SAIP. The Air Force
   will use the contractor's procurement schedule for SAIP to plan release of the SAIP orders to coincide
   with the contractor's scheduled release, DODI 5000.2, Part 7, Section A, Para J.

17.3. Policy:
   17.3.1. One of the keys to successful breakout is early identification of items and of major vendors by
   the prime contractor. Identification of major vendors six months prior to the submission of PTD will
   allow sufficient time for spares contracts to be established with the major vendors, which will allow
78                                                                                          30 APRIL 1999

     PIOs to be used for breakout spares orders. Otherwise, a PR must be used for breakout spares procure-
     ment, which greatly increases the procurement leadtime involved.
     17.3.2. Breakout will be based on contractor recommendations. The Air Force may decide, based on
     breakout filter chart (figure 17.1) to break out additional items. Rationale for deviations from contrac-
     tor recommendations must be documented by item in the remarks block of the PTD, or annotated on
     the PTD to be retained in the item folder by the IMS.
     17.3.3. All SOW/SOOs specifying provisioning requirements must contain a statement similar to the
     following: It is Air Force policy that selected vendor spares must be purchased from other than the
     prime system/equipment contractor if it is determined such purchase will reduce acquisition costs
     without compromising the integrity or supportability of the system in which the parts are to be used.
     The contractor shall code procurable first appearance nonstocklisted items of which the contractor is
     not the actual manufacturer and that the contractor recommends for breakout.
     17.3.4. For existing contracts citing MIL-STD-1552A (or its replacement), the phased provisioning
     block ("C" card, block 30 of contractor input) will be used for the contractor to recommend breakout.
     This code appears on the AFMC Provisioning System document in block 60, "phased provisioning
     code (PPC)".
     17.3.5. The contractor will be instructed to use the following codes in the first position of contractor
     technical information code (CTIC) block (LSA-036 "E" card, Block 61, DED 058 for existing con-
     tracts citing MIL-STD-1388-2B or its replacement; block 62, DED 066 for contracts citing
     MIL-STD-1388-2A or its replacement). This code displays in the PPC block (block 60) on the AFMC
     Provisioning System document.

   17.3.6. During the provisioning guidance conference, the contractor will be advised that spares are
   subject to breakout and will be requested to provide actual manufacturer (CAGE) code and P/N. The
   contractor must provide applicable breakout code and a source/vendor list IAW applicable CDRL.
   17.3.7. Pertinent DCN information received from prime contractor will be amended to spares con-
   tract to assure spares are delivered in pro-rata relationship to the configuration for the end item deliv-
   ered, or in the latest usable configuration.
   17.3.8. Initial spares actually manufactured by the prime contractor will continue to be bought via
   PIO on the end item production or spares contract.
   17.3.9. If two or more actual manufacturers are identified and recommended by prime, the item will
   be referred to the contracting officer for competition consideration.

17.4. Responsibilities:
   17.4.1. The SSM/EAIM:
       17.4.1.1. Works with the provisioning office, IMSs, and ESs toward achieving breakout on all
       contracts that include provisioning.
       17.4.1.2. Assures that initial spares breakout is included in the provisioning strategy. Includes
       breakout requirements in the SOW and instruction to offerer (ITO).
       17.4.1.3. Ensures, via the SOW, that the prime contractor remains responsible for all provisioning
       data and configuration control, even if spares buys are broken out to the vendor.
       17.4.1.4. Uses the information received from DI-MGMT-80894, Source/Vendor List, to deter-
       mine, for each applicable breakout vendor, if it would be appropriate to establish PIO breakout
       spares contracts. Existing contracts and follow-on contracts may use DID DI-V-5320A/T.
       17.4.1.5. Initiates PRs with required backup data to secure those breakout contracts. Contracting
       officers require a minimum of 180 days to establish vendor PIO contracts. The minimum data
       required is the estimated number of spare items and the estimated total cost for each vendor. The
       source of the data should be in the following order of precedence as available:
          17.4.1.5.1. Actual data from LSAR.
          17.4.1.5.2. Contractor's best estimate.
          17.4.1.5.3. Historical data.
       17.4.1.6. The SOW for the breakout spares contract will instruct the vendor that they are not
       relieved of the requirements for submitting normal provisioning data to the prime contractor, and
       will be required to furnish to the prime contractor data for spares orders to allow the prime suffi-
       cient time to meet their DCN requirements. This data will include quantity ordered by the Air
       Force by PCCN, PLISN, and reference number, quantity shipped, and proration quantities.
       17.4.1.7. Submits a sole source class justification and approval (J&A), if applicable, for each ven-
       dor contract.
       17.4.1.8. Notifies the prime provisioning office of what actions are taken to secure spares con-
       tracts with the vendors. Furnishes the necessary information to the provisioning specialist for
       update to the AFMC Provisioning System.
80                                                                                         30 APRIL 1999

        17.4.1.9. Ensures that PIO breakout spares contracts require the breakout vendors to attend provi-
        sioning guidance conferences.
     17.4.2. Provisioning Office Responsibilities:
        17.4.2.1. Assures that initial spares breakout is included in the provisioning strategy.
        17.4.2.2. Notifies the SSM/EAIM if breakout instructions are not included in the contract speci-
        fying provisioning requirements, and recommend the SSM/EAIM include them.
        17.4.2.3. Ensures the IPPS, attachment 2, for both the prime and breakout spares contracts specify
        clearly that the prime will remain responsible for data flow to the Air Force, and that the breakout
        contractors are required to furnish proration/order data to the prime to enable them to fulfill DCN
        requirements.
        17.4.2.4. Ensures that all prime contracts require attendance by the prime contractor at Air Force
        breakout contractor guidance and technical information meetings.
        17.4.2.5. In those cases when it is necessary to procure data from the breakout contractor, pre-
        pares data packages, including requirements for the IPPS, attachment 2, and DD Form
        1423,CDRL.
        17.4.2.6. Includes "Order Breakout to Vendors" on the agenda for all guidance conferences. Dis-
        cusses breakout at the guidance conferences, including, but not limited to, the following actions:
            17.4.2.6.1. Requests contractor furnish breakout codes for all procurable first appearance
            nonstocklisted vendor items.
            17.4.2.6.2. The contractor is not to recommend breakout later than the provisioning (technical
            review) conference. The preferred method for recommendation is as a part of the provisioning
            data as discussed in the PGC. This is a recommendation only; the final decision to breakout or
            not will be made during the residual support-item manager (RS-IM) cycle.
            17.4.2.6.3. The contractor will receive no notification of which items are to be broken out,
            except that the item record on the contractor notification tape/list will reflect a MOS Code 7
            and quantity procured or MOS Code 5 and no quantity if a PR is used with a listing of vendors,
            and that this listing may be used by the Air Force to identify major vendors and possibly let
            separate spares contracts with them. Existing contracts and follow-on contracts may use DID
            DI-V-5320A/T.
            17.4.2.6.4. To retain configuration control and submit DCNs for items which are broken out
            for direct procurement.
            17.4.2.6.5. That DCNs will include appropriate order/delivery information received from the
            breakout contractor to be portrayed as determined by the provisioning office.
        17.4.2.7. Will be prepared to conduct guidance conferences with the vendors for separate spares
        breakout contracts.
        17.4.2.8. When conducting on or off base technical and RS-IM reviews, insures that all ESs and
        IMSs are aware of the breakout codes, the data field where they can be found, their significance,
        and how these items are to be processed.
        17.4.2.9. Establishes and maintains vendor PIO contract information in the AFMC Provisioning
        System.
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                           81

   17.4.3. Equipment Specialist Responsibilities:
       17.4.3.1. Considering the contractor's recommendation (block 60, PPC, on the AFMC Provision-
       ing System technical review document), the ES will, as part of the technical review, determine if
       sufficient data is available to breakout items to the actual manufacturer. Sufficiency of the data is
       based upon the ES's knowledge and complexity of the item.
       17.4.3.2. If a decision against the contractor's recommendation is made during technical review,
       the PPC block will be updated with the new breakout code, and Remarks block updated to reflect
       the reason.

NOTE:
At this time, the AFMC Provisioning System can accommodate only one breakout code; therefore visibil-
ity of the contractor's recommendation is lost when the code is updated by the Air Force.
       17.4.3.3. In most cases the actual breakout decision will be made during the RS-IM review cycle.
       The ES will assist in the decision process as necessary.
   17.4.4. Item Manager Responsibilities:
       17.4.4.1. During the RS-IM review, the IMS will work in conjunction with the ES and SSM/
       EAIM to determine on an item-by-item basis whether items will be broken out.
       17.4.4.2. Processes RS-IM review document following normal procedures, except as follows:
          17.4.4.2.1. Assigns MOS 7 to breakout items acquired via separate vendor breakout PIO con-
          tract.
          17.4.4.2.2. Prepares AFMC Form 326 for appropriate vendor breakout PIO contract, if man-
          ual provisioning process is used.
          17.4.4.2.3. Determines one of the following alternate actions if items are recommended for
          breakout but a vendor PIO contract has not been established:
              17.4.4.2.3.1. Requests the SSM/EAIM establish a vendor contract to allow PIO action if
              lead time allows.
              17.4.4.2.3.2. Acquires from prime contractor on PIO (MOS 1).
              17.4.4.2.3.3. Prepares and processes individual item PRs to actual manufacturer and
              assigns MOS 5 to the item if lead time allows.

NOTE:
PIOs against vendor contracts must be used whenever possible. However, the use of single item PRs and
the dollar delimitation, if any, must be decided by the IMS on an item by item basis.

                         INITIAL PROVISIONING PRICE CHALLENGES

18.1. Purpose. The purpose of price challenges during initial provisioning is to correct unreasonable
estimated unit prices before they can be input into Air Force and DOD data systems. Proper application of
this procedure will eliminate the need for most downstream challenges made through other procedures.

18.2. Policy. This policy pertains only to those items being purchased through initial provisioning. These
price challenges are to be resolved with the contractor to the fullest extent possible at the provisioning
conference otherwise, the final PIO will have the Air Force estimated price in the unit price block, and the
word challenge will be printed in the remarks block before forwarding the PIO to the applicable DPRO.
This information will serve only as notification to the ACO that the Air Force considers the contractor's
estimated unit price to be unreasonable.

18.3. Procedures:
   18.3.1. At the provisioning guidance conference the Conference Chairperson shall ensure the con-
   tractor understands:
       18.3.1.1. The current definition of unit price as stated in the MIL-PRF 49506. Special emphasis
       should be placed on the potential adverse impact on various Air Force systems of unreasonable
       estimated prices. This should include, but not be limited to, the impact on base level stock fund
       accounts when requisitioning against abnormally high unit prices, and the potential distortion of
       future budget projects. The unit price shall be the best estimated price per unit of issue for each
       item based on the total recommended quantity, taking into consideration the quantity per unit pact
       and programming checklist data. The contractor should be prepared to provide, if asked, a quota-
       tion for a greater or lesser quantity, indication where appropriate, the existence of price breaks for
       particular batches or order quantities.
       18.3.1.2. Any unit price considered unreasonable will be challenged at the provisioning confer-
       ence. Unless the contractor can provide a more realistic price during the conference, the PTD will
       be updated to reflect the Air Force estimated price.
   18.3.2. At the provisioning conference:
       18.3.2.1. The ALC ES, CASC representative and conference chairperson, in conjunction with
       other Government attendees will question unit prices which are considered to be too high or too
       low based on historic or other data.
       18.3.2.2. If the contractor can provide a more reasonable price or agrees with the challenged
       price, the revised estimated price will be updated on the PTD and no other action is required.
       18.3.2.3. If the contractor disagrees, the conference chairperson will:
           18.3.2.3.1. Update the PTD with the Air Force estimated price.
           18.3.2.3.2. Insure the word "challenge" is output in the remarks block of the final PIO by
           using proper file maintenance procedures.
       18.3.2.4. CASC will send provisioning price challenges directly to the ALC Conference Chair-
       person under the following conditions:
84                                                                                          30 APRIL 1999

            18.3.2.4.1. CASC was not represented at the conference.
            18.3.2.4.2. CASC did not have sufficient time to review the PTD prior to the conference.

18.4. Summary:
     18.4.1. When an item is challenged at the provisioning conference and the contractor is in disagree-
     ment, it is absolutely necessary for the final PIO to reflect both the Air Force estimated price in the
     unit price block and the word "challenge" in the remarks block. This action will alert the DPRO that
     the estimated price was reviewed at the provisioning conference and the Air Force thought the con-
     tractor's estimated price appeared to be unreasonable. Again, we emphasize the need for the Confer-
     ence Chairperson to ensure the word "challenge" prints out in the remarks block of the final PIO, as
     this is our only means of communicating to the DPRO that the Air Force feels the contractor's esti-
     mated price was unreasonable at the provisioning conference.
     18.4.2. Even though the ALC ES should take the lead in handling price challenges at the provisioning
     conference, it is the responsibility of all government attendees to participate in challenging estimated
     prices.

   that SDFP (drawings, blueprints, and additional data) required for provisioning purposes, but not
   received with the applicable PTD, is obtained from the contractor as quickly as possible.
   22.1.2. AFMC Form 784, is used for requesting and controlling all SDFP requests. The system
   increases accuracy and provides processing of requests on an accelerated basis.

22.2. Application:
   22.2.1. The procedures contained here apply to all Provisioning Activities, RPTs and CASC/
   LLGHE-CDL. For ease of communication, references to SSM/EAIM ALC also applies to the RPTs
   and CASC. Procedures are applied, as outlined below, to all organizations which process SSRs.
   22.2.2. AFMC Form 784 is used for the following actions:
       22.2.2.1. Letter of transmittal from initiator to contractor through channels, as necessary.
       22.2.2.2. Request for specific type SDFP required by the initiator.

       22.2.2.5. Suspense file.
       22.2.2.6. Follow-up action.

22.3. Policy:
   22.3.1. AFMC Form 784 will be initiated by one of several activities, however, to avoid duplication,
   a request for SDFP for a given item will be initiated by only one activity IAW the following:
       22.3.1.1. By the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity when SDFP is contractually required,
       but not received with the PTD, from the contractor. This will include SDFP requirements of the
       Engineering & Reliability Branch in processing the PTDs.
       22.3.1.2. By the RIIM or IMS ALC when SDFP is contractually required, but not received with
       the PTD unless the AFMC Form 773 qualified the status of the specifically required drawings.
       22.3.1.3. By CASC for I&S reviews and when additional data and elements are required to pre-
       pare full descriptive method identifications.
   22.3.2. AFMC Forms 784 processed by the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity will be sent
   directly to the contractor with an information copy to the applicable ACO.
   22.3.3. All requests for SDFP will be submitted on AFMC Form 784.

     22.3.4. Normally, each request for SDFP will require a separate form and only one line item will be
     indicated on an AFMC Form 784. However, multiple items may be submitted on one form when it is
     certain a series of P/Ns appears on the same drawing from a single vendor/contractor (same CAGE)
     and when the same type of correction is needed.
     22.3.5. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity will set up a suspense file consisting of a mini-
     mum of two 31-day months. In keeping the suspense file dates for the monthly (30-day) suspense
     cycle, as used here, the numeric part of the date shown in Section I or II, depending on starting point,
     will always be retained with progression to the next applicable month. For example, a form initiated
     by the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity with a date of 31 March will show suspense dates of 30
     April, 31 May, 30 June, as necessary, regardless of actual dates follow-up action was initiated. A form
     initiated by other than the SSM/EAIM ALC with a date of 31 March will indicate a date of 30 April or
     31 May depending on time in transit from originator to the ALC Provisioning Activity (paragraph
     22.5.3.3.1). However, there will be only one suspense date reference on the form at one time. This sys-
     tematic method of periodic follow-up and use of initial numeric data eliminates the need for a dupli-
     cate cross-reference file.
     22.3.6. Only the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity will maintain a suspense and initiate fol-
     low-up actions. The initiator of AFMC Form 784, when other than the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning
     Activity, will verify requests for SDFP at 90 and 180 day intervals.
     22.3.7. Follow-up action by the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity will be on a monthly
     (30-day) cycle. The first follow-up (second request) will be made 30 days after the request is sent to
     the contractor. Subsequent follow-up requests will be at 30-day intervals until SDFP is received.
     22.3.8. Forms may be computer generated or legibly and neatly handwritten to minimize preparation
     time and potential errors.

22.5. Procedures:
     22.5.1. Initiating a Request for SDFP:
        22.5.1.1. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity upon receipt of the PTD for processing:
            22.5.1.1.1. Conducts a review to determine status of required drawings.
                22.5.1.1.1.1. When the provisioning monitors determine sufficient drawings have not
                been received to permit processing, they will immediately notify the contractor by tele-
                phone that the PTD has been suspended (rejected). Pending receipt of the required draw-
                ings, the notification will be confirmed in writing as soon as possible.
                22.5.1.1.1.2. When the provisioning monitors determine sufficient drawings have been
                received to permit processing, they will promptly prepare AFMC Form 784 in original and
                four copies for those drawings required but not received. The PTD will be released for pro-
                cessing.
            22.5.1.1.2. Records in Block 13, AFMC Form 773, or Block entitled Technical Data Status,
            AFMC Form 778, the status of drawings.
            22.5.1.1.3. Sends the original and one copy of the AFMC Form 784 to the contractor immedi-
            ately, with an information copy to the applicable ACO.
            22.5.1.1.4. Uses one copy of the AFMC Form 784 to establish and maintain the suspense file.
        22.5.1.2. The RIIM/IMS ALC Provisioning Activity upon receipt of PTD for processing:
            22.5.1.2.1. Conducts a review to determine status of required drawings.
            22.5.1.2.2. Requests drawings which are required but not received or accounted for on the
            AFMC Form 773 by preparing AFMC Form 784 in original and five copies.
            22.5.1.2.3. Records the status of required drawings in Block 13, AFMC Form 773, or Block
            entitled Technical Data Status, AFMC Form 778.
            22.5.1.2.4. Forwards the original and four copies of AFMC Form 784 immediately to the
            SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity for action.
            22.5.1.2.5. Files the fifth copy of the AFMC Form 784 as a matter of record pending reply.
            File will be in sequence of date prepared with oldest request in front.
     22.5.2. Processing a Request for SDFP:
        22.5.2.1. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity upon receipt of the AFMC Form 784 initi-
        ated by other activities:
            22.5.2.1.1. Checks file copy of AFMC Form 773 or 778, as applicable, to determine that
            requests do not duplicate those initiated earlier by the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity.
            22.5.2.1.2. Completes Section II of the forms and crosses out the words "Mail to" in Section I.
            22.5.2.1.3. Sends the original and one copy of the form promptly to the contractor for neces-
            sary action. In addition, sends an information copy to the applicable ACO.
            22.5.2.1.4. Sends one copy to CASC with the technical data package.
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                           97

       22.5.2.1.5. Uses the remaining copy of the form to establish and maintain the suspense file
       system.
    22.5.2.2. The provisioning chairperson instructs the contractor in the processing and use of the
    AFMC Form 784 during the guidance conference. Also, brief processing instructions for the con-
    tractor are printed on the reverse side of the form. The contractor should be instructed to:
       22.5.2.2.1. Process requests for SDFP and respond promptly, preferably within 20 days of
       receipt. Upon receipt of a request for SDFP not completely understood, the contractor should
       contact the initiator by telephone to resolve the question instead of implementing an extensive,
       time-consuming exchange of correspondence.
       22.5.2.2.2. Use the form for reply whenever possible, both for furnishing requested draw-
       ing(s) and for commenting in the space provided. If the requested data are unobtainable, the
       contractor should certify nonavailability of data in the portion provided for contractor's com-
       ments, and include a copy of contractor's request and vendor's refusal correspondence. Indica-
       tion of verbal communication will not be acceptable.
       22.5.2.2.3. Return one copy of AFMC Form 784 with response to help process the contrac-
       tor's reply, regardless of method of response used by the contractor.
       22.5.2.2.4. Direct all replies to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity.
       22.5.2.2.5. Complete Section III of the form and cross out the words "Mail to" in Section II.
 22.5.3. Establishing and Maintaining Suspense File. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity:
    22.5.3.1. Sets up suspense file using a 2-month period (31 days each).
    22.5.3.2. As the initiating activity:
       22.5.3.2.1. Inserts a date in the first block of Section VIII (using the retained copy) to replace
       1 month subsequent to the date reflected in Section II. A request dated 31 March will be
       assigned a suspense and follow-up date of 30 April, with actual follow-up action being initi-
       ated 1 May.
       22.5.3.2.2. Places annotated copy in the suspense file under the applicable suspense date
       reflected in the first block of Section VIII.
    22.5.3.3. As the forwarding activity (form initiated by other than the SSM/EAIM ALC Provision-
    ing Activity):
       22.5.3.3.1. Inserts a date in the first block of Section VIII (using copy retained) to reflect 1
       month after the date reflected in Section I. However, if the request was initiated more than 10
       days earlier, insert a date in the first block of Section VIII to reflect 2 months subsequent to the
       date reflected in Section I. The date in Section I is necessary for maintaining suspense file and
       to avoid duplicative cross-reference files.
       22.5.3.3.2. Places annotated copy in the suspense file under applicable suspense date reflected
       in the first block of Section VIII.
    22.5.3.4. As replies for SDFP are received, removes the copy from the suspense file and pro-
    cesses IAW paragraph 22.5. As date becomes due, removes remaining suspense copies (if any)
    and follows up IAW paragraph 22.5e.
98                                                                                          30 APRIL 1999

     22.5.4. Processing Receipt of SDFP:
        22.5.4.1. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity upon receipt of reply from contractor:
            22.5.4.1.1. Removes applicable copy from the suspense file, annotates action by the contrac-
            tor, and files in manufacturer's P/N sequence with the contract. If there are multiple P/Ns on
            the AFMC Form 784, annotates the copy appropriately. Files with the contract only after all
            items have been accounted for.
            22.5.4.1.2. For request initiated by the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity, reviews the
            information provided by the contractor and forwards the SDFP to the applicable activity for
            processing.
            22.5.4.1.3. For requests initiated by other activities, immediately completes Section IV,
            crosses out the words "Mail to" in Section III and sends to initiating activity for action.
        22.5.4.2. The initiating activity, when other than the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity:
            22.5.4.2.1. Removes the applicable copy from file and destroys. If AFMC Form 784 contains
            multiple P/Ns and the reply addresses only part of them, annotates the copy accordingly.
            Destroys the copy only after all items have been accounted for.
            22.5.4.2.2. Processes the information provided by the contractor, as necessary.
     22.5.5. Initiating follow-up Actions. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity:
        22.5.5.1. Maintains a systematic follow-up on all requests for SDFP, regardless of point of initia-
        tion.
        22.5.5.2. Reviews suspense file daily for requests requiring follow-up action.
        22.5.5.3. For requests requiring follow-up action, removes copy from suspense file and repro-
        duces three copies. Stamps only the reproduced copies "Second Request" plus current date in Sec-
        tion VII and mails one copy to the contractor, as already reflected in Section II, and one copy to
        the ACO.
        22.5.5.4. Using the retained (third) reproduced copy, inserts a date in the second block of Section
        VIII to reflect the new suspense date, attaches to suspense copy, and refiles in the suspense file.
        The new suspense file date reflected will be 1 month after the date reflected in the first block of
        Section VIII, regardless of the actual date the follow-up action was initiated.
        22.5.5.5. Continues periodic follow-up action to the contractor on a monthly (30-day) basis until
        request for SDFP is adequately completed; that is, receipt of required data or certificate of non-
        availability.
        22.5.5.6. If subsequent follow-up actions are necessary, repeats the above operation except as fol-
        lows:
            22.5.5.6.1. Identifies subsequent requests as third request, fourth request, etc, as applicable.
            22.5.5.6.2. Consolidates reproduced copies by contract number and forwards under cover let-
            ter signed at directorate level through applicable ACO by contractor requesting immediate res-
            olution of the problem. Forwards an information copy of letter to SPD, when appropriate.
     22.5.6. Verification of Request for SDFP:
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                           99

       22.5.6.1. The initiating activity, when other than the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity:
           22.5.6.1.1. Reviews file kept IAW paragraph 22.5.1.2.5 daily for requests 90 days old.
           22.5.6.1.2. For requests 90 days old, removes file copy and reproduces two copies. Stamps
           only the reproduced copies "Verification-90" plus current date in Section VII and mails one
           copy to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity as already shown in Section I.
           22.5.6.1.3. Attaches the retained (second) reproduced copy on top of the copy removed from
           file and refiles in original date sequence. In this manner, the oldest request will always be in
           the front of the file.
           22.5.6.1.4. Repeats the preceding operation again for any request left in the file 180 days.
           However, stamp reproduced copies "Verification - 180."
       22.5.6.2. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity upon receipt of requests for verification:
           22.5.6.2.1. Reviews files to find the exact status of request.
           22.5.6.2.2. Annotates appropriate comments/status on the verification copy, identifies same
           as SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity comments, and returns copy to initiating activity.
       22.5.6.3. Based on the systematic and regulated follow-up procedures outlined here, all requests
       for SDFP will be adequately completed; that is, receipt of required data or certificate of nonavail-
       ability, before end of 180 days from date of first request.

22.6. IMM Items. Any request for additional SDFP will be sent to the SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning
Activity for action by the contractor. This source (contractor) for additional SDFP will normally expire
with termination of the contract.

22.7. Drawings Loaned:
   22.7.1. Occasionally, contractors and vendors furnish the Government drawings for provisioning pur-
   pose that contain proprietary data, on the premise that such drawings will not be reproduced and will
   be returned immediately upon conclusion of their intended use; that is, help in the identification of the
   item in question.
   22.7.2. Each such drawing should be conspicuously marked detailing the contractor's desired/
   required restrictions. Drawings so marked will facilitate recognition, by all subsequent users, of stated
   restrictions and/or conditions under which drawings were provided.
   22.7.3. Loaned drawings received through the ALC Provisioning Activity will be returned to the sub-
   mitting contractor by the same route.

                                                 Chapter 23
                                   INTERSERVICE PROVISIONING

23.1. General. This chapter implements the Management and Execution of Integrated Logistics Support
(ILS) Program for Multiservice Acquisitions (AFR 800-43). The Joint Memorandum of Agreements, pro-
cedures, and acquisition documents are contained in the basic regulation. All related DIDs are published
as part of AMSDL, DOD 5010.12-L.
      23.1.1. This concept, originally identified as Standard Integrated Support Management Systems
      (SISMS), was first developed to be applied as the ILS document for multiservice aeronautical sys-
      tems. The Joint Logistics Commanders (JLCs) subsequently broadened its scope to include all system/
      equipment acquisition programs, either single or multiservice.
      23.1.2. Under this concept, the Executive Service will designate a ILS manager to execute the ILS
      program and support the program manager in all matters related to ILS programs. Each participating
      service will designate a ILS representative or service ILS manager who will act as the focal point on
      all logistics matters for that service.
      23.1.3. Joint Logistics Commanders' policy requires that any system/subsystem requiring a depot
      capital investment, including SE and facilities, exceeding $100,000 be reviewed by the Maintenance
      Interservice Support Management Offices (MISMOs) for interservicing opportunity. AFMCR
      800-30, Logistics Depot Maintenance Interservice, gives the policy and procedures for identifying
      candidates for depot maintenance interservicing evaluation.

23.2. Contract Requirements. Defense Acquisition Management Policies and Procedures, DODI
5000.2, directs the use of LSA throughout the acquisition program.

23.3. Provisioning Method. Essentially, with the exception of terminology, provisioning under this con-
cept is the same as provisioning under separate Air Force contracts. For example RPT functions are
accomplished as a part of a RILSA on a PCS basis at the contractor's facility. Provisioning may also be
accomplished through the conference team method (provisioning conference at the contractor's facility)
and/or the in-house method (provisioning conference at the Provisioning Activity). The method of provi-
sioning to be used will be determined by the program manager (executive service) for logistics in collab-
oration with the responsible SSMs and Provisioning Activity.

23.4. Responsibilities:
      23.4.1. In those cases where the Air Force is the executive service and one or more of the services are
      taking part, the following changes or additions to normal policy are needed:
         23.4.1.1. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity will:
             23.4.1.1.1. Help the participating service(s) if questions arise on provisioning data during the
             data call or upon receipt of the MIPR or contract.
             23.4.1.1.2. On major systems/end items programs and before contract award, invite represen-
             tatives of the provisioning activities from the participating services to an interservice provi-
             sioning planning conference. At this conference, explain the provisioning methodology to be
             used, the proposed PPS, the input which will be required from the participating services, when
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                        101

        those inputs will be required and interservice channels of communication. For less than major
        systems/end items programs, a letter to the other service Provisioning Activity covering the
        areas discussed above will suffice.
        23.4.1.1.3. Inform participating services' Provisioning Activities of any changes in the provi-
        sioning schedule and of any other information which may affect their ability to support their
        initial deployment.
 23.4.2. In those instances where the Air Force is the participating service and one of the other ser-
 vices is executive, the following changes or additions to normal policy are necessary.
    23.4.2.1. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity will:
        23.4.2.1.1. Upon notification of their forthcoming participation in a multiservice provisioning
        effort on a major system or equipment, request the executive service to chair an interservice
        provisioning planning conference. Areas to be covered are the same as in 23.4.1.1.2 above. On
        less than major systems/end items programs, a written statement from the executive service
        explaining their approach to the areas covered above will suffice.
        23.4.2.1.2. Respond to data calls provided by the executive service through the appropriate
        Air Force data management office (DMO). Along with this, every effort should be made to use
        data being obtained by the executive service as long as the data is in the applicable acquisition
        document format.
        23.4.2.1.3. Attend the provisioning guidance conference established by the executive service.
        Any peculiarities which have been identified between services should be identified to the con-
        tractor at this point (for example, if the Air Force wants a PCL and the other service does not,
        this should be explained).
        23.4.2.1.4. Attend other service chaired provisioning conferences if the Provisioning Activi-
        ties' attendance is warranted.
        23.4.2.1.5. Upon receipt of post-provisioning conference documentation, process it through
        the same internal Air Force channels as the data would be processed if the Air Force were
        executive service. NIMSRs and SSRs are prepared by the appropriate ALC activity and for-
        warded to the appropriate service/agency for support IAW AFMCR 400-21 and DOD
        4140.26-M.
    23.4.2.2. The SSM/EAIM Engineering and Reliability Branch will:
        23.4.2.2.1. Provide appropriate representation to all interservice provisioning conferences.
        23.4.2.2.2. Comply with the requirements of paragraph 14.2.2.8 of this regulation.
        23.4.2.2.3. Prepare a trip report on the conference and send one copy to the HQ AFMC provi-
        sioning office.
    23.4.2.3. CASC will:
        23.4.2.3.1. Provide appropriate representation to all interservice provisioning conferences.
        23.4.2.3.2. Comply with the requirements of paragraph 14.2.4 of this regulation.

                             DOD WHOLESALE MATERIEL MANAGER

24.1. Purpose. To provide policy and procedural guidance in implementing DOD 4140.26-M, Defense
Integrated Materiel Management for Consumable Items.

24.2. Policy:
      24.2.1. There will be only one DOD Wholesale Materiel Manager for each consumable item. This
      determination is made IAW DOD 4140.26-M, Chapter 2.
      24.2.2. Existing IMM assignment for items with NSNs should be available from the DLSC provision-
      ing screening results which updated the PTD. The PICA will uniquely define and identify the DOD
      item management relationship.

24.3. IMM Determination:
      24.3.1. During the process of establishing SMR codes, the provisioning team will assign the applica-
      ble IMC to each new item selected as a logical spare.
      24.3.2. The ES will take the lead in assigning the IMC, with the other team members participating
      based on assigned responsibilities. In the event of disagreement, the ES will make the final decision.
      24.3.3. The IMC assigned to new items will be annotated on the PTD in the appropriate space.
      24.3.4. Determination of IMM for new items in the excluded FSCs is relatively simple, since such
      items will be registered to the introducing service.
      24.3.5. Once IMMs are established, DLSC screening results will reflect the assigned IMM by the
      PICA code. Thus, determination of IMMs for items appearing on PTD will be reduced to new items,
      generally items without an assigned NSN.

24.4. Override Authority:
      24.4.1. Since the initial IMC assignment for new items was a result of a team effort, subsequent over-
      ride authority will be limited to the following:
         24.4.1.1. When validation of new items by CASC/LA activities reveals previous IMC establish-
         ment/assignment to exist, notify the appropriate IMS ALC.
         24.4.1.2. Where I&S relationships determined by CASC/LA dictate a change in assigned IMC,
         notify the appropriate IMS ALC.
      24.4.2. Changes other than those outlined above will not be made without including complete justifi-
      cation for the change on the PTD.
  30 APRIL 1999                                                                                          103

                                  INTEGRATED MANAGED ITEMS
                                       (AFMC FORM 715)

25.1. Purpose. Programming Data for DLA/Other Service Managed Items, AFMC Form 715, used by
the SSR system in evaluation and support of consumable managed by DLA or other services is estab-
lished and file maintained in the AFMC Provisioning System by the establishment of the PCCN master
file. The AFMC Form 715 is used to transmit this data for items coded for DLA or other services manage-
ment.

25.2. Application.
   25.2.1. The SSM/EAIM ALC Provisioning Activity prepares and submits the AFMC Form 715 and
   establishes the PCCN master file.
   25.2.2. The AFMC Form 715/PCCN master file may be prepared/established anytime after the full
   range of data becomes available but not later than with the initial submission of PTD. Resubmission
   of an AFMC Form 715 and update of the PCCN master are required only when the data originally
   submitted are changed.
   25.2.3. An AFMC Form 715 is required for every PCC assigned
   25.2.4. Subsequent submission of PTD for which the AFMC Form 715/ PCCN master file was previ-
   ously submitted/established requires validation of the programming data to determine whether a
   change has been made. When program changes occur during the life of the contract, annotate the PCC
   in Block 12, AFMC Form 773. When program changes occur at any point during the life of the con-
   tract, analyze changes to determine their effect on items previously transmitted to integrated materiel
   managers for support. Program changes having an effect on operational dates, end item delivery, date
   repair parts are required, and contract termination require updating the AFMC Form 715 and the
   PCCN master file. The following are examples of programming changes that require updating the
   AFMC Form 715 and the PCCN master file:
       25.2.4.1. Late receipt of end items. Delay caused by redesign during production.
       25.2.4.2. End items delivered. Not operational pending delivery of another end item.
       25.2.4.3. Program realignment and time required for overhaul, end items out of operation for long
       periods of time.
       25.2.4.4. End items in process of being removed from system.
       25.2.4.5. Contract terminated, at which time all actions including provisioning action were termi-
       nated.
       25.2.4.6. End items undergoing tests over an extended period of time. Anticipated usage will not
       occur until end items are in complete operational phase.
       25.2.4.7. Extension or contraction of the delivery schedule and/or a change to the average/
       adjusted months program(s).

25.3. Preparation. Enter all dates on the form in four digits, the first being the last digit of the calendar
year and the last three digits being the numeric day of the year.

      25.3.1. Copy Requirements:
         25.3.1.1. Keep a copy of each AFMC Form 715 initiated in the official contract file for future ref-
         erence and validation before release of subsequent PTD.
         25.3.1.2. Furnish two copies to each SSR organization, if applicable.
      25.3.2. Explanation:
         25.3.2.1. Heading Blocks:
             25.3.2.1.1. To and From. Enter the appropriate activity and office symbol.

             ager's supply system to support requisition submitted by users of the end item being provi-
             sioned. The DRPR must take into account the anticipated procurement lead time, warranties
             and/or ICS, in addition to the OND, when they are part of the contract.
             25.3.2.2.4. Line 4. Enter the name, model, number or type designation of the end item being
             provisioned.

             25.3.2.2.7. Line 5c. Enter the number of months involved in the delivery of end items on con-
             tract. This can be determined from the programming check list by determining the progam
             time base (PTB) where the adjusted months inventory program stops increasing. Enter the
             PTB number where this occurs. If the program is still increasing at PTB 48, use 48 if no addi-
             tional schedule information is available on the programming check list.
             25.3.2.2.8. Line 6. Enter the CAGE of the end item.

 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                         105

          25.3.2.2.12. Line 10. Enter the percent of end items which will be delivered to or deployed
          from the east coast. Use 99 to indicate 100 percent.
          25.3.2.2.13. Line 11. Enter the stock record account number (SRAN) of the IMS ALC
          requesting support (AFM 67-1, Volume I, PART TWO).
          25.3.2.2.14. Line 12. Enter the office symbol of the applicable SSM and IMS.
          25.3.2.2.15. Line 13. Enter the appropriate adjusted (formerly peak) month program at PTB
          12 from the programming checklist as follows:
             25.3.2.2.15.1. If the programming check list was developed on the RDB IRD, the number
             will be displayed as a whole number; in this case, enter the whole number in the first 3
             positions of the field (right justified, zero filled) and enter zeroes in positions 4 and 5.
             25.3.2.2.15.2. If the programming check list was developed manually, or by a system
             other than IRD, the program may have decimal places displayed. In this instance, the num-
             bers preceding the decimal go into positions 1 through 3 (right justified), zero filled); the
             first two decimal places on the programming check list are entered in positions 4 and 5.
             25.3.2.2.15.3. These instructions apply regardless of the type of program code.
             25.3.2.2.15.4. Current active PCCN masters should be reviewed, and updated with current
             program data when applicable, upon receipt of new submissions of PTD.

NOTE:
Do not complete AFMC Form 715 if the programming check list is not available. Establishment of the
PCCN master using bogus program numbers will result in erroneous SSR quantities being computed in
the D169.
          25.3.2.2.16. Line 14. Enter the type of program code from the programming checklist
          (H=Hours, M=Months, R=Rounds).
          25.3.2.2.17. Line 15. Enter the average month program (AMP) from the programming check
          list. See additional instructions in para 25.3.2.2.15 above. If the programming check list is not
          available, do not complete this form or establish the PCCN master until it becomes available.
             25.3.2.2.17.1. For the depot, the AMP is developed for the PTB which will be at least 12
             months. There is a decimal between the 3rd and 4th digit which allows for computation to
             hundredths.
             25.3.2.2.17.2. For the base, the AMP is developed for the total deliveries of end articles on
             contract to sites activated during the program forecast period (PFP).
          25.3.2.2.18. Remarks. On initial submission of AFMC Form 715, enter the symbol of the
          applicable SSM/EAIM/RIIM to which subsequent support advice and NSN assignments
          should be sent.

25.4. Special Conditions:
   25.4.1. Same End Item Under Multiple Contract Item Numbers. When the same end item of equip-
   ment appears under multiple item numbers on the contract for different funded programs, only one
   AFMC Form 715 is required for which only one PCC will be assigned. Only one weapon system des-
106                                                                                           30 APRIL 1999

      ignator code (WSDC) can be assigned to each PCC, therefore , only one weapon system can be iden-
      tified as a user unless multiple PCCN(s)/PCC(s) are assigned. See Chapter 26. The data required by
      line items 5 (5a, 5b, 5c) and 9 will be determined and shown as follows:
         25.4.1.1. Consolidate the total end item quantity on the contract and enter in Line 9.
         25.4.1.2. For line item 5 (5a, 5b, 5c) review the contract to determine:
             25.4.1.2.1. Calendar year the first end item will be delivered and enter the last digit of the cal-
             endar year on Line 5a.
             25.4.1.2.2. Calendar year quarter when the first end item will be delivered and enter on Line
             5b.
             25.4.1.2.3. Overall number of months involved in the delivery of the end items on contract
             and enter on Line 5c.
      25.4.2. Design Change Notices:
         25.4.2.1. Validation of programming data is required to determine whether a change has been
         made.
         25.4.2.2. When programming data has not changed, updating of the AFMC Form 715/PCCN
         master file is not required.

                     SUPPLY SUPPORT REQUEST (SSR) ADVICE NOTICE

26.1. Purpose. To establish policy and procedures on the provisioning process in the course of comply-
ing with DOD 4140.26-M. Knowledge of this regulation is necessary since it takes precedence over the
following guidance in cases of conflict.

26.2. Single Focal Point. Each ALC has a single focal point for the submission, receipt, processing, and
control of all SSRs and advice notices related thereto. Since functional address symbols are not standard
and for the ease of communication, the single focal point will be referred to as the SSR organization.

26.3. Policy:
   26.3.1. The prime provisioning ALC assigns the PCC. Provisioning technicians will not duplicate
   PLISNs within the PCC/PCCN.
   26.3.2. The SSM/EAIM/RIIM ALC will send PTD/sDFP showing items needing SSR action to the
   SSR organization.
   26.3.3. Clothing and textile type requirements are excluded from SSR processing. The Provisioning
   Activity will send these to AFC&TO, Philadelphia, PA. AFC&TO will develop applicable supply
   request packages.

26.4. Provisioning Control Code:
   26.4.1. The PCC is a 3-digit alphanumeric code assigned by an SSM/EAIM/SE IMS/RIIM ALC
   responsible for provisioning support of a system/end article, end item of SE or recoverable item.
   These codes provide a positive control feature in data processing and data exchange between the
   above activities, SSR originators, and IMMs.
   26.4.2. Instructions and criteria for assignment of PCC are:
       26.4.2.1. All digits of the PCC are variable. Each provisioning parts list must have at least one
       PCC assigned to it. A PCC assigned to a system will be used only when the items involved are
       directly related to the system. Equipment, components, end items of SE, recoverable items which
       perform a function when used in a system as a whole, or give support thereto (such as end items of
       SE), will be given separate PCCs.
       26.4.2.2. Alphanumeric characters 2, 5, 7, A and B for column 57 are not available for use with
       PTD. These characters have been reserved for use by the SSR organization in the control of
       non-provisioning SSRs.
   26.4.3. A register will be kept within each ALC Provisioning Activity to avoid duplication of code
   assignments. Once a code is assigned, it is not to be used on another contract until the original con-
   tracts are closed out. No local forms will be prescribed for the register.

26.5. Procedures. Procedural details are limited mostly to those actions essential to identify, screen,
review, and process Air Force requirements for items designated for management by other than the Air
Force:
108                                                                                        30 APRIL 1999

      26.5.1. The applicable provisioning organization, upon receipt of PTD for local processing and deter-
      mination of Air Force requirements, will review and break out items coded for management by other
      than the Air Force to the SSR organization for needed actions.
      26.5.2. The SSR organization will take action to prepare required SSRs.
      26.5.3. When an AF Form 86, Request for Cataloging Data/Action, is required, it will accompany
      the SSR through the processing cycle. AFMC Form 918, may be used for non-provisioning SSRs.
      AFMC forms will not accompany SSR transactions to other military services, Defense Logistics
      Agency (DLA) or General Services Administration (GSA).

26.6. Restriction on Air Force Buy. AFM 67-1, Volume III, Part One, Chapter 10, prohibits issuing ini-
tial shipping instructions for direct shipment to the user for stock fund items on provisioning orders unless
there is a funded requisition on hand. Air Force interim buy of items designated for DLA management is
not authorized unless conditions (that is, funded requisition) of above referenced AFM 67-1 are evident
and DLA has indicated that they can not meet our DRPR in the SSR (see DOD 4140.26-M). The provi-
sioning organization will furnish all needed inputs including drawings and other technical data, when
available.

               INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS PROGRAM (ILP) PROVISIONING

27.1. Purpose. Provisioning is the primary method of obtaining spares support for ILP system sales of
items not previously provisioned for USAF.

27.2. Application. This provisioning policy applies to ILP acquisition of new weapon systems and mod-
ifications which include initial support in the letter of offer and acceptance (LOA) or supplemental condi-
tions. Definitization applies the customer country's parameters to provisioning already completed for the
Air Force.

27.3. Policy. Basic provisioning policy contained in applicable chapters within this regulation apply to
ILPs. Purchases for FMS customers must be implemented under normal acquisition and contract manage-
ment procedures set forth in the FAR and other directives. However, the FMS customer may request that
a defense article or defense service be obtained from a particular prime source. In such cases, FAR
6-302-4 and DFARS 6.302.4 provide authority to contract without full and open competition. See AFMC
FAR Supplement 5306-1 and 2 for sample formats. The FMS customer may also request that a subcon-
tract be placed with a particular firm. The contracting officer shall honor such requests from the FMS cus-
tomer only as specified in the LOA or other written direction by the military sales organization.

27.4. Procedures:
   27.4.1. A provisioning guidance conference is required to achieve a mutual understanding of the con-
   tractual requirements of the acquisition document involved, and to establish provisioning milestones.
   The guidance conference is conducted IAW Chapter 6, with AFMC Air Force Security Assistance
   Center (AFSAC) representatives and ILP customer as the using command, invited. The applicable
   system case request checklist, AFMAN 16-101, Security Assistance Management, provides data per-
   tinent to the programming checklist and the maintenance concept.
   27.4.2. The provisioning conference is required to select the range and depth of items needed to sup-
   port a system during its initial operating period. Initial support is usually limited to a 2-year support
   level but is specified in the system case request checklist.
       27.4.2.1. If a system case request checklist does not include initial support or training, or provides
       for limited support, this must be stated in the LOA or supplemental conditions. If ICS is required,
       it must be stated in the LOA and identified as a separate line item.
       27.4.2.2. In addition to the requirements of Chapter 14, ILP provisioning source coding includes:
           27.4.2.2.1. Requisition number assignment
           27.4.2.2.2. Destination and delivery schedule determination.
           27.4.2.2.3. Computation of total quantity.
   27.4.3. Nonstandard items are not included in the DOD inventory nor procured for use by DOD. Non-
   standard items and the extent to which they are supported must be identified in the LOA. Initial sup-
   port for nonstandard items (when provided) will be IAW AFMCM 72-2.

         27.4.3.1. Nonstocklisted items will be stocklisted with an ILP MMAC and obtained by PIO or
         PR. These codes are:
            • SA-ALC-XX(LAV), XT(LPE)
            • OO-ALC-PU(MMS), XW (all other)
            • OC-ALC-XV
            • SM-ALC-XY
            • WR-ALC-XZ(LK), EX(LN), XG(LK)
         27.4.3.2. Nonstandard stocklisted items will be requisitioned or obtained on PIO, dependent on
         program requirements.
      27.4.4. If the ILP customer procures engineering data, the SSM ALC will send, or require the con-
      tractor to send a copy of this data to CASC for use in preparing item identification and NSN assign-
      ment.
      27.4.5. Standard stocklisted items will be requisitioned from source of supply (SOS).
      27.4.6. DLA items for ILPs are not supported by SSR, but are obtained upon receipt by SOS of
      funded requisition.
      27.4.7. The AFMC Provisioning System will be used for ILP provisioning. The POP must be specif-
      ically tailored for the ILP requirement as agreed to in the provisioning guidance conference.
      27.4.8. SAIP, DODI 5000.2, PART 7, SECTION A, Paragraph 3j applies to ILP support.

                                              Chapter 28
                               PROVISIONED ITEM ORDER (PIO)

28.1. Purpose:
   28.1.1. A PIO is an unpriced order issued under a contract to acquire spares, repair parts, support
   items, and PTD for new or modified Air Force weapon systems or end items of equipment. A PIO is
   used to acquire only that quantity of an item forecast to be needed for a limited period of initial sup-
   port. This period begins with the OND (as shown on the programming checklist, reference AFI
   23-106) at delivery of the first system/equipment to the first operational unit, and continues through
   the PFP. When warranties and/or ICS are involved in the provisioning effort, the terms and conditions
   of the warranties and/or ICS on contract should be used in determining the OND, e.g., if a three-year
   warranty applies to spares, then the OND should be lead-time away from the warranty expiration date.
   The PFP is the spare part item lead time plus 3 months past either the OND or the date of the first end
   article delivery which has a new item that was not installed on previous deliveries of the end article.
   28.1.2. The PIO is used to furnish the PPCO with a written request for items to be bought through the
   provisioning process on a production or separate provisioning spares contract.
   28.1.3. The PIO, when attached to Standard Form 30, Amendment of Solicitation/Modification, by
   the PPCO, sets forth the specific items ordered, the estimated cost, and the required delivery schedule
   and destination.

28.2. Application. These instructions apply to IMSs responsible for ensuring the availability of initial
support for all items (for which they have assigned management responsibility) that are obtained through
the provisioning process. The instructions also apply to the Provisioning Activity which processes spare/
repair parts orders and contain information for the PPCO to issue the orders.

28.3. Policy:
   28.3.1. AFMC Form 326 or PIOs output by the AFMC Provisioning System are the only documents
   used to authorize the issuance of or to be attached to Standard Form 30 for all PIOs and changes
   thereto, including interim release approvals, unless a specific deviation is authorized in writing by HQ
   AFMC Provisioning Policy Office. Deviation must also be authorized in writing by HQ AFMC Pro-
   visioning Policy Office when spares are to be obtained by an exhibit to a production contract. PIOs
   may be used to obtain data; this applies to PTD only.
   28.3.2. Separate AFMC Forms 326 will be prepared for investment type items and expense type
   items. These items must not be mixed together on a page.
   28.3.3. The contractor must be told of the action to be taken on all interim release items.
   28.3.4. An exhibit line item number (ELIN) will be assigned by the PPCO for each item ordered and
   entered on the AFMC Form 326 before the forms are sent to the contractor. PIOs output from the
   AFMC Provisioning System will have mechanically assigned ELINs with the exception of prorated
   ELINs assigned by contractors and for PIO error corrections.
   28.3.5. When increasing the quantity of an item on order, the added quantity is considered a new
   requirement and a new ELIN will be assigned by the PPCO or the AFMC Provisioning System. This
   does not apply to minimum buy quantity or interim release items being processed for the first time
112                                                                                          30 APRIL 1999

      when the determination is made to increase the quantity recommended by the contractor. Interim
      release items are not on order until an AFMC Form 326 or a mechanized PIO attached to a SF 30 is
      sent to the contractor.
      28.3.6. To ensure legibility of all AFMC Forms 326, they will be prepared using reproducible ink.
      Crossouts, strikeovers, etc, will be permitted on PIOs when unit prices are incorrect due to definitiza-
      tion of subsequent DCNs (the actual dollars obligated for each individual ELIN reflects the final, cor-
      rect unit price) Correction to the AFMC Forms 326/mechanized PIOs will be coordinated with the
      Provisioning Activity.
      28.3.7. Request for Cataloging Data/Action for LLILs must be submitted within 20 days of submis-
      sion of the PIO.
      28.3.8. When the DLSC screening or CASC/DLA preprovisioning review reveals an item or an
      acceptable substitute has a NSN, a PIO will not be used unless one of the following exceptions apply:
         28.3.8.1. New items having NSNs due to early cataloging action or a delay in PIO processing, but
         not previously procured by the Government.
         28.3.8.2. A PIO may be used to buy a new item, which was stocklisted during incremental provi-
         sioning of a system/equipment, as long as the item is within its initial support period or program
         forecast period (procurement leadtime plus 3 months).
         28.3.8.3. A PIO may be used to buy items currently stock listed without a DOD user. This
         includes FMS items that were previously country peculiar.
         28.3.8.4. A new item that is out of the initial support period but has not yet been identified
         through the provisioning process. A one-time PIO can be issued for the PFP quantity provided the
         item meets the PIO policy criteria outlined above.

NOTE:
This does not relieve the IMS of the obligation to pursue any or all breakout opportunities that may exist
or are recommended by the contractor. Under these conditions, normal breakout policy as defined in
chapter 17 will apply.
         28.3.8.5. An item affected by a DCN submitted after release of the original PIO will be processed
         during the quantity delete/part added (QD/PA) transaction for the quantity remaining on order.
         Any and all subsequent requirements for items included in this category, except those involved in
         incremental provisioning, will be processed via PR and under no circumstances will additional
         PIOs be issued.
      28.3.9. A PIO will not be used to buy an item:
         28.3.9.1. Which was previously bought through a replenishment requirements system (D041 or
         D062). Emergency requirements, including mission capability (MICAP) requirements, will be
         supported through the use of urgent PRs as specified in AFMCPD 23-1.
         28.3.9.2. From the prime contractor if it has an acquisition method code (AMC) that specifies
         competitive procurement or direct procurement from the actual manufacturer (other than prime
         contractors). PIOs to actual manufacturers are addressed in Chapter 17 of this regulation, and in
         Chapter 8 of AFMCM 65-33.
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                         113

      28.3.9.3. Is stock listed (as revealed by DLSC screening or CASC/DLA preprovisioning review),
      unless one of the above exceptions 28.3.9.1 through 28.3.9.2 applies.
      28.3.9.4. Is being procured as a replenishment buy under the SAIP technique.
      28.3.9.5. If the item identified during provisioning is design stable and sufficient lead time exists
      to support the weapon system/end item OND through the use of a PR.
      28.3.9.6. For an initial spare item in support of a production lot subsequent to the initial support
      period/PFP.
   28.3.10. If the item is available from commercial off-the-shelf inventories or has commercial servic-
   ing capabilities and will be used to support a commercial end item, a PIO will not be used unless writ-
   ten justification to establish provisioning requirements is included in the official contract file. The
   justification, written by the SPD, will validate the need to provision the commercial end item and the
   need to maintain on-hand inventories of support items instead of relying on commercial off-the-shelf
   inventories or commercial servicing contracts. The following considerations, at a minimum, will be
   addressed:
      28.3.10.1. Availability. The availability of commercial inventories or servicing capabilities will
      be described and assessed.
      28.3.10.2. Impact. The impact to combat readiness, combat effectiveness, and worldwide sup-
      portability by relying on commercial inventories or servicing capabilities will be described and
      assessed.
      28.3.10.3. Repair Kits. When an on-hand supply of support items appears to be warranted, a
      description of why issuance of a one-time repair kit concurrent with end item delivery is not a fea-
      sible alternative.
   28.3.11. As a result of an APC when items are purchased on AFMC Form 326, provisioner will load
   the ELINs that were identified and associated information into the AFMC Provisioning System to
   ensure interface with the Acquisition and Due in System (J041) will be complete.

28.4. Procedures:
   28.4.1. The Prime Provisioning Activity or RPT:
      28.4.1.1. Provides special instructions (for the preparation of AFMC Forms 326, assignment of
      ELINs for DCNs and PIO corrections) on the AFMC Form 773 when sending the PTD for pro-
      cessing. Keeps copy requirements to a minimum.
      28.4.1.2. Ensures all AFMC Forms 326 received are properly prepared. Enters appropriate CLIN
      on the AFMC Form 326.
      28.4.1.3. Reviews mechanized PIOs for errors, i.e., Exhibit identifier, CLINs, and takes appropri-
      ate action to correct.
      28.4.1.4. Combines all AFMC Forms 326/mechanized PIOs and forwards to the funds manager in
      turn to the PPCO using AFMC Form 773 or 778. Ensures separate forms are sent for investment
      and expense type items. The original AFMC Form 326 is provided to the PPCO. After processing,
      the PPCO reproduces the copies needed to complete order for distribution.
114                                                                                          30 APRIL 1999

         28.4.1.5. Ensures transmittal of corresponding QD/PA PIO actions or provides in remarks infor-
         mation why these corresponding actions are not being forwarded at the same time.
         28.4.1.6. Ensures pertinent information is given to the PPCO regarding manual ELINs, reason for
         actions, etc.
         28.4.1.7. Identifies all PIOs for items being procured under the SAIP concept by marking "SAIP
         ITEM" on those PIOs. These markings may be either handwritten or stamped. Red ink must be
         used in either case. Letters should be approximately 1" tall.
         28.4.1.8. Suspenses a copy of the AFMC Form 326/mechanized PIO until a copy of the PIO
         (Standard Form 30 with attached AFMC Form 326/mechanized PIO) is received from the PPCO
         indicating the PIO has been released to the contractor. The suspense copy may then be sent to the
         ALC DST office for inclusion of data in the Packaging and Transportation Data System if they are
         not on the distribution list and require a copy. A copy of the PIO, as sent to the contractor, is kept
         in the contract file in the Provisioning Activity.
         28.4.1.9. Ensures the appropriate cataloging action is input via Air Force/DLIS Edit and Routing
         System (D143C) within prescribed time limits.
      28.4.2. The EAIM/IMS ALC Provisioning Activity:
         28.4.2.1. Indicates copy requirements on AFMC Form 778.
         28.4.2.2. Ensures complete instructions as provided by the prime Provisioning Activity are
         included on AFMC Form 778/773 regarding ELINs.
         28.4.2.3. Ensures AFMC Forms 326 received from the IMS are properly Prepared.

         Activity or RPT.
         28.4.2.6. Ensures the appropriate cataloging action is submitted via D143C within prescribed
         time limits.
         28.4.2.7. Makes appropriate input to the AFMC Provisioning System for output of PIO at the
         Prime Provisioning Activity.
      28.4.3. The IMS:
         28.4.3.1. When processing non-mechanized PIO, prepares an original AFMC Form 326 and
         reproduces the number of copies required as specified on AFMC Form 778/773. When preparing
         AFMC Form 326, gives special attention to instruction on AFMC Form 778/773 for completion of
         the ELIN blocks for DCNs and PIO error corrections.
         28.4.3.2. When processing LLIL for interim released items, prepare an AFMC Form 326 or
         appropriate transaction for output of PIO in the AFMC Provisioning System for all items on the
         LLIL.
         28.4.3.3. Submits appropriate cataloging action via D143C.
         28.4.3.4. Sets up delivery schedules IAW paragraph 28.4.4.
      28.4.4. Delivery Schedule Criteria:
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                        115

       28.4.4.1. The dates set up for required deliveries are based upon the expected need dates for the
       item. Every effort must be made to place orders far enough in advance of need to allow for the
       contractor's normal production leadtime from date of order release to date of first delivery.

NOTE:
A minimum of 30 days is necessary for the award and contract receipt process, therefore, schedules, as a
minimum, must reflect this leadtime.
           28.4.4.1.1. Where program revision, design change, etc, result in the release of an order less
           than production leadtime from need date, first delivery will be established IAW projected need
           date, but no earlier than 30 days from the date of PIO.
           28.4.4.1.2. Requests for delivery at less than stated production leadtime will normally only
           occur when it is known the spares are ready or nearly ready to be shipped by the contractor, as
           in the case of DCNs where the contractor began production of the new part prior to receipt of
           the confirmatory PIO.
           28.4.4.1.3. Other circumstances allowing this would include quantity changes or error correc-
           tion on items with outstanding PIOs, SAIP items, etc., when IMS has reason to believe the
           contractor can meet the requested delivery dates.
           28.4.4.1.4. If none of the above apply, the IMS will use the stated production leadtime plus 30
           days from the PIO date as the earliest requested delivery date.
       28.4.4.2. Need dates can generally be determined as follows:
           28.4.4.2.1. ISSL requirements for spares are normally delivered 60 to 120 days (depending
           upon cost) before OND dates IAW activation schedules.
           28.4.4.2.2. Insurance items should be scheduled for delivery to coincide with delivery of the
           last production article.
           28.4.4.2.3. Spares requirements in support of depot stockage, repair, overhaul, and base
           demands are normally required 60 to 120 days in advance of requirements or anticipated repa-
           rable generations of the next higher recoverable assembly.

28.5. Preparation:
   28.5.1. Mechanized PIOs are output based on IMS update transactions to PTD in the AFMC Provi-
   sioning System. Instructions for these updates are contained in the user's manual for the AFMC Provi-
   sioning System.
   28.5.2. The data required at the top of AFMC Form 326 must be completed as follows:

          28.5.3.12.2. Month - Specify the required delivery by month by entering the quantities for
          delivery with that month.
          28.5.3.12.3. Destination - Indicate the initial destination (SRAN) for the quantities listed. The
          destination block for the second line is available, if needed.
      28.5.3.13. QUP - Enter the quantity of unit pack.
      28.5.3.14. Unit Price - Insert the unit price (estimated) as shown on the PTD. Use definitized
      prices, if available.
      28.5.3.15. Total Cost - Insert the total cost (estimated) of the quantity to be bought. This figure
      will be the result of multiplying the quantity by the unit price.
      28.5.3.16. Remarks - Include any additional or explanatory information. In the event more space
      is needed, continue on next line.
      28.5.3.17. Page Total $ - Considering all actions taken, indicate at the bottom of each page the
      total dollars (estimated) involved and whether the page total is an increase or decrease in dollars.

28.6. Data Change After PIO:
   28.6.1. When the Provisioning Activity has initiated action to catalog an item introduced through the
   provisioning process and the response by CASC results in an existing NSN, the Provisioning Activity
   will forward that information to the IMS. The IMS will review for appropriate action to be taken. If
   required, the IMS will immediately prepare and process through provisioning channels an AFMC
   Form 326 or required information for input to the AFMC Provisioning System to cancel the PIO,
   unless a PIO is allowed under the exceptions listed in paragraph 28.3.8. The PTD will be processed
   IAW chapter 15.
   28.6.2. Part number corrections will be processed as error corrections (action code EC) on AFMC
   Form 326 or appropriate transaction in the AFMC Provisioning System.
   28.6.3. Changes to SMR codes which affect the ERRC (ERRC N to P, ERRC P to N, and procurable
   to nonprocurable) will be coordinated with the Provisioning Activity and IMS to ensure appropriate
   action is taken on PIOs.
   28.6.4. Reinstatement of ELINs will be accomplished by a modification issued by the PPCO. Author-
   ity to reinstate the ELINs will be provided either through the provisioning office to the PPCO or by
   the IMS to the PPCO.

                                                 Chapter 29
                      RECORDING OBLIGATION/DEOBLIGATION OF FUNDS

29.1. General. This Chapter gives procedures for making commitments, obligation and deobligation of
funds for provisioning requirements procured on PIOs in compliance with Section 1311, Public Law 663.
These procedures permit continuation of the normal methods of preparation and processing of PTD by
contractors IAW provisioning appendices.

29.2. Requirements for Estimated Cost:
      29.2.1. PIOs will be segregated as to investment/expense type items. Release of AFMC Forms 326
      will require a total estimated cost.
      29.2.2. In exception cases, the IM/ES may be requested to estimate unit costs when time is not avail-
      able to allow the contractor to obtain valid price estimates. Unit price is an element which we buy
      from the contractor, and should be obtained from the contractor by the Prime Provisioning Activity.

29.3. Confirmation:
      29.3.1. Provisioning Conference. This conference provides for support item selection and assignment
      of technical and management codes. However, the quantity of items for purchase is not normally
      established or confirmed during the conference. Accordingly, the total estimated cost of an order is
      neither established nor confirmed. Only under the APC are PIOs prepared reflecting the total esti-
      mated costs. The PIOs are promptly released to the contractor as authorized by the ALC PPCO,
      thereby complying with Section 1311, Public Law 663, as implemented by AFR 170-8.
      29.3.2. SE provisioning review team (PRT) Action. As a result of the SE PRT action on the AFMC
      type contract, the written order will be prepared by the PRT chairperson and signed by the ALC
      PPCO. The order will include a total estimated cost of the items and quantities initially reviewed. Also
      included are any increased quantities of items previously selected and approved by the PRT. The PRT
      chairperson will ensure the total estimated cost is included with the written order. Any previously
      selected, but unaltered items and quantities approved by the SSM/EAIM and released to the contractor
      would already be recorded as an obligation.

29.4. Fund Information:
      29.4.1. The IMS ALC, when forwarding AFMC Forms 326 to the Prime Provisioning Activity will:
         29.4.1.1. Consolidate the estimated total costs (investment/ expense) from the AFMC Forms 778.
         29.4.1.2. Enter the estimated cost of the total PIO in block 19 of the first endorsement, AFMC
         Form 773, by investment and expense, as applicable.
      29.4.2. The Prime Provisioning Activity will:
         29.4.2.1. Consolidate the estimated total costs (by investment and expense) from the AFMC
         Forms 773 received from IMS ALCs and the AFMC Forms 778/773 and PIOs received from IMSs
         within the SSM/EAIM ALC or the PIOs output from the AFMC Provisioning System.
         29.4.2.2. Prepare AFMC Form 773 (or AFMC Form 778, if applicable), in two copies for trans-
         mittal of the PIO to the SSM funds manager in turn to the PPCO, reflecting the total estimated cost
 30 APRIL 1999                                                                                         119

       of the order (investment/expense) in block 15 on the AFMC Form 773 (or the remarks section of
       AFMC Form 778).
   29.4.3. The SSM Funds Manager will:
       29.4.3.1. Review PIO for funds availability. If funds are available, annotate funds cite in block 21
       of the AFMC Form 773 or in the remarks block of AFMC Form 778.
       29.4.3.2. If funds are not available, forward PIO to the SSM with annotation that insufficient
       funds are available for the order.
   29.4.4. If funds are not available, the SSM will upon receipt of the unfunded PIO from the funds man-
   ager:
       29.4.4.1. Review program requirements, available funds, and determine necessary adjustments to
       the order.
       29.4.4.2. Return the unfunded PIO to the Prime Provisioning Activity for adjustment of items and
       quantities to dollar value available.
   29.4.5. The Prime Provisioning Activity, upon receipt of the unfunded PIO from the SSM will initiate
   action within the SSM/EAIM ALC to reduce items and quantities as directed by the SSM. The AFMC
   Form 326/mechanized PIO will be processed IAW para 29.4.2 above. The Prime Provisioning Activ-
   ity will provide the involved IMSs with a copy of the revised AFMC Form 326/mechanized PIO for
   update of records as applicable.

29.5. Release of PIO and obligation of funds:
   29.5.1. The ALC PPCO upon receipt of AFMC Form 326/mechanized PIO list from the SSM funds
   manager, attaches the PIO list to the SF 30, Amendment of Solicitation/ Modification of Contract, and
   issues the contract modification against the contract line items (CLINs) for provisioning spares.
   29.5.2. The PPCO then prepares an administrative commitment document (ACD) and processes it to
   the responsible ALC/FM office. The ALC/FM office certifies that there are sufficient funds to cover
   the total estimated price. After certification, the PPCO releases the PIO to the contractor who must
   provide a proposal withing 60 days. The ACO negotiates a firm price and delivery schedule for the
   PIO and definitizes the PIO withing 180 days of issuance.
   29.5.3. The ALC/FM organization should be consulted for detailed guidance on the rules of funds
   obligation. Obligation of funds, a legal reservation of a specific amount of funds associated with a
   firm contract or other obligating document that will require payment in this or future periods, involves
   certain absolute rules/limitations, established by public law, that must be observed:
       29.5.3.1. Specificity. The 31 USC 1501 requires documentary evidence of a binding agreement
       for specific goods. Any agreement that fails this test is not a valid obligation.
       29.5.3.2. Bona Fide Need. A particular fiscal year's appropriated funds may be obligated only to
       meet a legitimate need of that same fiscal year. In contrast, stock funds are "no year" funds.
       29.5.3.3. Expired funds are no longer available for obligation. The availability of appropriated
       funds for obligation varies from 1 to 3 years depending on the type of funds. Stock funds are avail-
       able for for obligation for 1 year.
120                                                                                           30 APRIL 1999

         29.5.3.4. Consistency. Consistency of funds means continuing to use the same type of funds to
         satisfy a particular requirement once that type of funds has been specified.
      29.5.4. The PIO must be retained by the ACO to support obligations/deobligations (see para 29.7)
      recorded as a result of the release of the PIO to the contractor until superseded by priced exhibits
      incorporating the related provisioned items into the contract by supplemental agreement. The ALC
      PPCO's file of PIOs is also retained as supporting documentation.

29.6. Additional Funds Requirements:
      29.6.1. If, at any time, the ACO or the contractor determines that funds originally obligated are insuf-
      ficient to cover the total cost for items on any PIO, the PPCO will be notified in writing of the need for
      additional funds. The PPCO will prepare an ACD for additional funds and forward it to the SSM
      funds manager. The funds manager will advise the PPCO as to funds availability. If funds are avail-
      able, the ACD will be forwarded to the local accounting office for certification. The PPCO will then
      prepare an SF 30 to obligate the additional funds.
      29.6.2. When additional funds are not available, the PPCO will return the PIO to the SSM for review
      and action to reduce items and/or quantities to the dollar value available. The SSM will return the PIO
      to the Prime Provisioning Activity for adjustment of items and quantities in the AFMC Provisioning
      System. The Prime Provisioning Activity will then process the adjusted PIO IAW para 29.4.5 above.

29.7. Decreased Dollar Amounts. When PIO definitization results in a decrease in the funding required,
excess funds should be deobligated IAW Air Force FAR SUP 5317.7603-90.

29.8. Reponsibility of the single manager for funds:
      29.8.1. While many organizations are involved with the funds associated with the PIO process, single
      managers have ultimate responsibility for managing these funds. In this case, "managing" means
      ensuring that funds are used for their intended purpose, and knowing the status of funds (i.e., what
      funds have been committed, obligated, deobligated, have entered expired status, or have been can-
      celed).
      29.8.2. Single managers are also responsible to ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory lim-
      itations, compliance with Air Force funds control policies and procedures, submission of interim
      reports on suspected violations, and prompt investigation and reporting of all actual violations.

29.9. Reponsibilites of all personnel involved in funds management:
      29.9.1. All personnel who, in their assigned duties, are specifically authorized to distribute funds, cer-
      tify funds availability, commit funds, incur obligations, or expend funds are accountable officers. In
      addition, other persons who advise, oversee, or direct actions may be named responsible parties.
      Accountable officers and responsible parties are "accountable" and "responsible" for the decisions and
      actions made during their tenure even after they have left the particular job.
      29.9.2. Proper PIO funds management entails establishing strong and clear lines of communication
      between the single manager, the provisioning procuring contracting officer, the administrative con-
      tracting officer, the appropriate ALC product directorate's financial management point of contact, and
      the DFAS paying station.

                                                 Chapter 30
                   OBLIGATION OF FUNDS OTHER SERVICES CONTRACTS

30.1. General:
   30.1.1. The provisioning and ordering of spares from the contractors under the cognizance of other
   services will conform to any existing interservice provisioning agreements with the various contract-
   ing agencies.
   30.1.2. The obligation document released to the contractor by the contracting military services will be
   used as the basis for recording obligations.

30.2. Forwarding PIO. The Provisioning Activity will forward PIOs involved with other military ser-
vices to the appropriate program office via transmittal form, AFMC Form 773 (or AFMC Form 778, if
appropriate), in two copies. That office will ensure the availability of sufficient funds prior to the issuance
of a MIPR amendment to the contracting military service.

30.3. Insufficient Funds. PIOs that exceed available funds for a given program year will not be released.
If sufficient funds cannot be obtained, the directorate funds control officer (or Planning and Technical
Support Branch) will return the PIO to the Provisioning Activity. The Provisioning Activity will immedi-
ately refer the document to the appropriate Engineering and Reliability Branch. That organization will
review the PIO and establish the criteria required to reduce the items and/or quantities to the available dol-
lars. The PIO will then be sent to the IMS(s) for revision IAW the set criteria. Upon completion, the
revised PIO will be returned to the Provisioning Activity who will, in turn, forward the document to the
SPD involved for an update of records.

30.4. Request for Additional Funds. AFMCPD 23-1, Purchase Request (PR) and Military Interdepart-
mental Purchase Request (MIPR) Operations outlines the rules to be followed for processing requests
from other military services (as a contracting activity) for additional AFMC funds for provisioned items.

30.5. Cancellation Actions. See AFMCPD 23-1, for procedures on cancellation action for provisioned
items.

30.6. Provisioning Action Completed. The Provisioning Activity will advise the SPD and the account-
ing and finance office when provisioning is completed. The SPD will begin action with the contracting
agency to decide whether excess funds exist. If so, the SPD will promptly prepare and distribute a decom-
mitting MIPR document.

30.7. Forms Prescribed. AFMC Form 408, Initial Spares Support Items, AFMC Form 715, Pro-
gramming Data for DLA/Other Service managed Items, AFMC Form 718, Provisioning Perfor-
mance Schedule, AFMC Form 726, Provisioning Document Control, AFMC Form 771, Conference

2. Correspondence:


2.1. Address all correspondence pertaining to spare/repair parts provisioning and related data items to the
PPA.


2.2. The PPA shall be the sole Government activity with which the contractor interfaces on initial provi-
sioning matters, unless specifically authorized by the PPA. Pursuant to paragraph 2.1 and this paragraph,
correspondence from the PPA shall be accepted and all provisioning actions therein accomplished unless
otherwise directed by the Principal Contracting Officer (PCO).


3. Conferences.


3.1. Provisioning Guidance Conference (PGC) is required. Contractor must submit a written request for
waiver of the conference to the PPA if a PGC is not desired.


3.2. Spares Provisioning Conference (SPC) requirements will be determined at the PGC.
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                  135

3.3. A sample article of the component/end item is /is not required at the SPC. If required, sample arti-
cle will be viewed /disassembled at the conference.


4. Spares Acquisition Integrated with Production (SAIP) is /is not applied. When applied, employ
the concept of a concurrent release of spare orders with identical production installs. If not formally
applied, any opportunity to combine spares orders with production installs to lower costs should be
exploited.


5. Manufacturers or Commercial Manuals are/are not required. When required furnish a manufac-
turer’s or commercial manual to supplement the Short Form Provisioning Parts Lists (SFPPL) or Provi-
sioning Parts Lists (PPL) that have embedded Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) equipment. All
publications prepared and printed without regard to Government format and outline but which include a
parts list will be acceptable as a manufacturer or commercial manual for the purpose of this requirement.
This requirement applies only to available manuals for the end item or components thereof. No manuals
will be developed to satisfy this requirement.


6. Interim Release (IR) is /is not authorized.


7. Statement of Prior Submission (SPS) is required where applicable. The SPS is submitted to cer-
tify that the contractor/subcontractor has previously furnished the Government PTD for the end item or
any component thereof which may satisfy the PTD requirements of this contract. The SPS will include
identifying information (current procurement or previous submission) such as contract number, contract/
exhibit line item number, end item/component type or model number/reference number, item name, man-
ufacturer’s name and Commercial and Government Entity Code, PPA receiving the PTD and date pre-
pared, NSN (if available) and other information as required by the PPA. If the Government determines
that the previously submitted data is adequate, the SPS may result in reduction or elimination of PTD and
Supplemental Data for Provisioning requirements specified on DD Form 1423 and conference require-
ments.


8. Provisioning Performance Schedule (PPS), AFMC Form 718. PPS (Atch 1) will be developed by
PPA and Contractor at the PGC.


9. Supplemental Data for Provisioning (SDFP): For provisioning purposes, SDFP order of precedence
shall be:


9.1. Data equivalent to approved product engineering drawings.


9.2. Data equivalent to in-process/incomplete product engineering drawings.
136                                                                                     30 APRIL 1999

9.3. Commercial drawings


9.4. Commercial manuals, when required to provide information on a commercial assembly.


9.5. Catalogs or catalog descriptions.


9.6. Sketches or photographs with brief descriptions of dimensional, materiel, mechanical, electrical, or
other descriptive characteristics. When sketches or photographs are provided for an assembly, a bill of
material shall also be provided.


10. Design Change Notices (DCN). DCNs will include all changes required to an item previously pre-
sented to align spares support with actual production items. Unless specifically instructed otherwise by
the PPA, the contractor shall notify the PPA of any and all changes whether of a production or modifica-
tion type which are approved for incorporation into the system/equipment furnished under the contract.
DCNs are to be accompanied by applicable SDFP.

10.1. Changes resulting from omission or correction of data previously submitted are considered admin-
istrative changes. This type of change may be submitted in non-standard PTD formats to include business
letter, computer lists, etc, as directed by the PPA at the PGC.


10.2. Reference Number Changes. Reference numbers are not to be rolled or changed unless specifi-
cally allowed by applicable specifications. New design numbers are not to be assigned strictly for admin-
istrative or manufacturing purposes, or to facilitate the production control process.


10.3. Reference Items. Submit DCNs against only the first appearance items, unless specifically
instructed otherwise by the PPA.


10.4. DCNs to document changes made during the provisioning process by the Government to previously
submitted PTD shall not submitted.


10.5. Procurable Type Items. DCNs for procurable type items are required to be submitted within
twenty-one (21) days after release for fabrication or procurement for prime contractor design items and
forty-two (42) days after release for fabrication and procurement of subcontractor supplied items.


10.5.1. DCNs Requiring Revision to Provisioned Item Orders (PIO). When a design change affects
any part ordered by the government, the contractor shall take immediate action to affect the following
revisions and incorporate the results on DCNs for approval:
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                          137


10.5.1.1. Deletions. When a design change reduces or eliminates spare/repair parts requirements for the
end item/component, the contractor shall delete or reduce such requirements originally ordered by PIO in
the ratio authorized by the program data applicable to the end items on order that are affected by the DCN.


10.5.1.2. Adjustments. When a spare/repair part previously ordered by the Government is replaced by
another item, and the replacing part is not stocklisted, the contractor shall fabricate or procure the new
item in the same ratio as the number of end items/components affected by the change not to exceed the
amount funded for affected items. When the adjustment requires an increase in the total quantity recom-
mended or additional items of support, the increase will be recommended by the contractor in accordance
with program data provided by the PPA.


10.6. Nonprocurable Type Items. When required by the PPA, design change data for nonprocurable
type items (items not coded as spares) (Source, Maintenance, Recoverability (SMR) Code first position
X, A, M, K) will be prepared in accordance with instructions from the PPA. Submittals will be within
sixty (60) days after release for fabrication or purchase.


11. PTD Submittal Specifications. The following paragraphs provide specifications for submission of
PTD by multiple card image on tape to be compatible with the AFMC Automated Provisioning System
(hereafter referred to as the D220 System). Strict adherence to these instructions must be applied to
ensure PTD is accepted by the D220 System. Data elements to be included in the PTD are reflected in
attachment 2.


11.1. Media. Multiple card image records on nine track magnetic tape, 1600 Bits Per Inch (BPI) using
Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC), Odd Parity, with American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) labels. Records are 80 charachters long blocked by 37 records (2960 character
block).


11.2. Labels. Internal standard tape label is required. A standard label is the ANSI computer operating
system physical tape initialization structure that is generated when a tape is initialized or formatted and is
not part of the data file.


NOTE: For definitive instructions on labels see the ANSI. Failure to comply with ANSI will prevent
D220 system acceptance of PTD.

decimal placement of a data element field, or subfield, can be found in MIL-PRF-49506. Data elements
not contained in the LMI are defined in Atch 2.


11.6. Type PTD “D”, DCN. DCN submittals require the following:


11.6.1. Header Card per para 11.4.1.


11.6.2. For Replaced PLISNs:


11.6.2.1. 01A Card with PCCN, PLISN, Type of Change Code (TOCC), CAGE, Reference Number and
CSN entered.


11.6.2.2. “F”, “G” and “H” Cards as required.


11.6.3. For Superseding PLISNs: Cards “A” through “L” are required as applicable.


11.6.4. The following information is provided for preparation of DCNs and use of the TOCC. There are
five basic types of PTD updates which are required when data is added, changed, or deleted affecting pro-
visioning lists (PL) previously delivered. These transactions are required based on data changes in provi-
sioning data baselined by a previous PTD submittal.


11.6.4.1. Standard Data Update. For each PTD card affected by data which has been added or changed
since the previous PTD delivery, mandatory data, i.e., PCCN, PLISN, CSN, and CFI, an “M” TOCC and
the added/changed data only are required. If data has been deleted, a “G” is required in the TOCC and in
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                      143

the left most position of each field deleted on the appropriate PTD card. Data deletions and changes/addi-
tions occurring on the same PTD card will require both a change and deletion card for the appropriate
data.


11.6.4.1.1. If all data on a PTD CFI is deleted, a delete transaction is required consisting of the PCCN,
PLISN, CSN “01”, CFI (except A), the key data associated with that PTD Card, and a “G” TOCC.


11.6.4.1.2. When an entire PLISN record is deleted, a delete transaction is required consisting of the
appropriate PCCN, PLISN, CAGE, Reference Number, and a “D” TOCC on the 01A card. Also, if the
reference designation exists, it along with the PCCN and PLISN on the 01D card with a “G” TOCC is
required. In addition, if any change authority related information is changed, CFIs “F”, “G” and “H”
update transactions are also required.


11.6.4.2. Quantity Data Update. If a quantity field is updated, mandatory data, a “Q” TOCC, and the
updated quantity data field(s) are required. This will only apply to the following data: Quantity Per
Assembly, Quantity Per End Item, Total Quantity Recommended, Quantity Shipped, Quantity Procured
and Prorated Quantity. If additional data displayed on the same PTD card also changes, only one change
card is required with TOCC “Q”. If quantity data is deleted, a change card is required with a zero filled
quantity and TOCC “Q”.


11.6.4.3. Key Data Update. Certain provisioning data are considered key and associated data elements
and are listed below. Changes to key data requires the submission of both a delete and change card for the
appropriate key data. The deletion card should contain a “G” TOCC and the original key data. The
change card should contain an “M” TOCC with new key data and applicable associated data. When key
data is deleted, deletion of the corresponding associated data is required.

                                        Quantity Procured


         Serial Number Effectivity      None


11.6.4.4. Associated Data Update. Changes to associated data require the submission of a change card
consisting of an “M” TOCC with the changed data and entry of the applicable key data. Deletion of asso-
ciated data requires the submission of a deletion card with a “G” TOCC, a “G” in the left most position of
the associated data field and entry of the key data.


11.6.4.5. Design Changes with Limited Serial Effectivity. When PTD updates are submitted for these
design changes, Change Authority Number and Serial Number Effectivity along with a “L” TOCC for the
replaced item are required. If a quantity change occurs on a limited effectivity item, an “L” TOCC is
required in lieu of a “Q”. The superseding item is submitted with a “blank” TOCC.


12. Additional Information. Information regarding the following requirements or any other provision-
ing matter may be requested from the PPA through the PCO by the contractor prior to contract award.
Requests for this information must be submitted to the PCO in writing. Detailed guidance on these sub-
jects will be provided at the PGC. This information may also be available in the Bidder’s Library.


12.l. Instructions for Failure Factors, Maintenance Replacement Rate 1 (MRR1), Condemnation
Below Depot (CBD), Condemnation at Depot (CAD), Overhaul Replacement Rate (ORR), and Not
Repairable this Station (NRTS). It should be noted that the AF definition for MRR1 differs from the LMI
Data Product Definition (DPD) #0560.


12.2. Provisioning Factor Table. This table is used to determine which factors are required for items
assigned a procurable SMR code.


12.3. Contractor Notification (CN) Products. These products are generated by the AF in the provision-
ing process. The contractor shall specifiy desired media for CN products, i.e., tape or hardcopy, during
30 APRIL 1999                                                                                  145

the PGC. Peculiar AF data elements will be included in CN products which will be explained at the PGC.
The Government does not require the contractor to develop an Automated Data Processing (ADP) capa-
bility to accept Provisioned Item Orders (PIO) and/or the CN products by magnetic tape.
