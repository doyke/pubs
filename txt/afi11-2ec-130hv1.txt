  1.2.4. Squadron supervisors will:
     1.2.4.1. Ensure adequate continuity and supervision of individual training needs,
     experience, and proficiencies of assigned/attached crewmembers.
         1.2.4.1.1. Authorize specific, individual crewmembers to carry BMC qualification
         and will be notified by the squadron training office (DOT) if a CMR designated
         crewmember fails to maintain CMR status.
     1.2.4.2. Review training/evaluation records to determine the training required for newly
     assigned crewmembers and formal training graduates to achieve BMC/CMR status.
     1.2.4.3. Ensure ready aircrew program (RAP) missions further develop basic combat
     skills/tactical employment, simulating conditions anticipated in the unit mission. Only
     effective RAP missions will be logged as RAP sorties. See Attachment 2 for RAP
     mission definitions.
     1.2.4.4. Review qualifications and training requirements of Flight Surgeons (FS) and
     determine appropriate flight restrictions.
     1.2.4.5. Determine missions/events in which individual BMC crewmembers will
     maintain qualification versus familiarization.

     1.2.5. Individual crewmembers will:
        1.2.5.1. Hand carry all available training records to the gaining unit for qualification and
        training assessment.
        1.2.5.2. Complete training requirements and currencies within the guidelines of this
        instruction.
        1.2.5.3. Participate only in activities for which they are qualified and current.
1.3. Processing Changes:
     1.3.1. Forward recommendations for change to this instruction to the ACC/A3 through
     ACC/A3I on an AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
     1.3.2. ACC/A3 will:
        1.3.2.1. Process recommendations for change.
        1.3.2.2. Forward recommended changes to AF/A3O-AT for AF/A3 approval.
        1.3.2.3. Address time-sensitive changes by immediate action message.
1.4. Training. Training programs for all COMPASS CALL crewmembers are designed to
progress them from basic flying qualification training (Initial Qualification Training (IQT)), or
Requalification Training (RQ), to Mission Qualification Training (MQT) and finally to
Continuation Training (CT).
     1.4.1. For the EC-130H, IQT/RQ and MQT is divided into three Phases, as defined below.
        1.4.1.1. Phase 1 is Initial Qualification Training or Requalification.
            1.4.1.1.1. All flight crew other than AMTs receive initial training in basic flying
            duties at the basic C-130 IQT or RQT (Phase 1). Upon completion of this training,
            pilots, navigators, and flight engineers attain Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ).
            However, pilots, navigators, and flight engineers must complete difference training
            (i.e., the academic portion of the applicable 42 ECS syllabus and a minimum of two
            sorties on an EC-130H) before being designated qualified to fly unsupervised in the
            EC-130H.
            1.4.1.1.2. All Mission Crew and AMTs receive combined Phase 1 and Phase 2
            training at the 42 ECS.
        1.4.1.2. MQT is divided into Phase 2 and Phase 3.
            1.4.1.2.1. Phase 2 provides the training necessary to qualify a crewmember in a
            specific crew position for flying duties needed to perform the COMPASS CALL
            mission.
            1.4.1.2.2. Phase 3 includes additional ground and mission qualification training
            required to be designated as CMR. Upon completion of Phase 3, the crewmember
            will have received training in all the basic missions of their specified unit.
            Crewmembers are then assigned to either a BMC or CMR position.
     1.4.2. Continuation Training (CT). The two aspects of CT are non-RAP and RAP
     requirements. Non-RAP requirements consist of aircrew training in basic flying skills that
AFI11-2EC-130HV1 30 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                            9


  ensure safe operation of the aircraft. RAP requirements consist of specific mission-related
  training and focuses on capabilities needed to accomplish a unit's core tasked missions.
  1.4.3. Specialized Training. Specialized training consists of training in special skills
  necessary to carry out the unit's assigned mission. Specialized training includes crew
  position upgrades, specialized mission equipment training, quick reaction capabilities (QRC)
  training, alternate mission equipment (AME) training, etc. and CT to maintain proficiency in
  special capabilities. Specialized training is accomplished upon assignment to CMR/BMC
  status. Unless otherwise specified, crewmembers in CMR/BMC positions may hold special
  certifications/qualifications provided additional training requirements are accomplished.
     1.4.3.1. QRCs are capabilities requiring one-time training and certification.
     Documentation of specialized training will be made in personnel training records. AMEs
     are capabilities which have formal training and certification requirements and may have
     RAP requirements as well.
     1.4.3.2. The RAP Tasking Memorandum will designate RAP events for specialized
     mission equipment, number of crews required to meet capability levels and may include
     any special instructions for QRCs (events, currencies, crews, etc.).
  1.4.4. Aircrew Status. As defined in AFI 11-202, Vol 1, Aircrew Training, all aircrew will
  be assigned to CMR, BMC or BAQ status.
     1.4.4.1. CMR crewmembers maintain proficiency and qualification in all core missions
     of the flying unit to which they are assigned or attached. CMR crewmembers maintain
     currencies that affect CMR status, accomplish all core designated flight training (sorties
     and events), and all mission ground training. Failure to complete this training or maintain
     these currencies results in regression to non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by the
     ECG/CC. While N-CMR, crewmembers may perform missions, including exercises, in
     which they are current and qualified, similar to BMC crewmembers. CMR positions are
     filled by crewmembers completing minimum training for the individual to be qualified in
     all primary missions of the assigned unit and weapon system.
         1.4.4.1.1. All combat-coded unit API 1/2/A, flying SQ/CC, and SQ/DO positions are
         designated CMR positions. The ECG/CC may designate other API-6/B positions not
         assigned to the flying squadron as CMR. If a unit is overmanned, the SQ/CC may
         elect to train the front line of the Unit Manning Document (UMD) API-1/2/As to
         CMR and designate the overage BMC. In this case, priority should be given to
         designating at least 50% of available inexperienced crewmembers as CMR.
         1.4.4.1.2. All NAF or higher API 6/8 evaluator positions, and USAF Weapon School
         Instructors, will maintain NCMR. All other API 6/8 positions will maintain BMC.
         ECG/EGV will maintain a list of current API 6/8 flyers along with their assigned N-
         CMR/BMC training level.
     1.4.4.2. BMC crewmembers maintain familiarization with all unit core missions. For
     those missions in which they maintain familiarization only, BMC crewmembers must be
     able to attain proficiency and qualification in 30 days or less. BMC crewmembers
     accomplish all mission-related ground training designated by their attached SQ/CC.
     Failure to complete BMC required training results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC)
     status. While N-BMC, crewmembers may not perform RAP training sorties without
 10                                               AFI11-2EC-130HV1 30 SEPTEMBER 2011


      supervision (IAW paragraph 1.5.4.) until a SQ/CC-approved recertification program is
      completed. BMC positions are filled by crewmembers who complete the minimum
      training required for the individual to be familiar with all and qualified in some of the
      primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapon system.
          1.4.4.2.1. BMC crewmembers may be upgraded to CMR and deploy/participate in
          any mission for which they are qualified. Minimum upgrade training will be outlined
          in the supplement to this volume. Additional training will be determined by the
          SQ/CC.
      1.4.4.3. N-CMR/N-BMC. Crewmembers regressing to N-CMR/N-BMC status will
      accomplish the requirements identified in paragraph 4.7.
      1.4.4.4. Unqualified (UQ). Unqualified crewmembers require additional training and a
      flight evaluation for progression to higher qualification levels. All crewmembers
      unqualified in the aircraft must perform their duties under the direct supervision of an
      instructor/evaluator.    UQ crewmembers include personnel: enrolled in Initial
      Qualification Training (IQT); downgraded for lost currency; downgraded for
      demonstrated lack of ability, or downgraded for failure to meet standards during flight
      evaluation.
      1.4.4.5. Basic Aircraft Qualified (BAQ) (pilots, navigators and flight engineers only).
      BAQ personnel must undergo Phase 2 and Phase 3 training prior to designation as BMC
      or CMR. Additional requirements may be defined in the supplement to this volume.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
   1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
   consistent with flight safety and resource availability. The need for realistic training must be
   balanced against the expected threat, aircrew capabilities, and safety. This instruction
   provides training policies for use with procedures specified in applicable flying/operations
   publications.
      1.5.1.1. Contested Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) Operations. All mission training
      sorties will include at least one contested EMS training event as defined in the latest RAP
      Tasking Memorandum.
   1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (TRSS) will develop and validate training programs
   when/where tasked.
   1.5.3. SQ/CCs must ensure training missions enhance combat capability in squadron-tasked
   roles and maintain crewmember proficiency. RAP training missions should emphasize basic
   combat skills using scenarios based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and
   opposition capabilities. Use of procedures applicable to combat scenarios is desired, e.g.
   appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery
   procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reporting, threat reactions, contested EMS operations,
   and intelligence briefing/debriefing.
   1.5.4. In-flight Supervision. The following personnel must be under direct supervision of an
   instructor when performing aircrew duties:
      1.5.4.1. All unqualified and non-current crewmembers.
AFI11-2EC-130HV1 30 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                            11


          1.5.4.1.1. Non-current crewmembers will be supervised when performing those
          events in which they are non-current.
          1.5.4.1.2. Pilots who are unqualified or non-current in the aircraft per Table 4.4.
          require direct supervision during critical phases of flight.
      1.5.4.2. All crewmembers undergoing IQT/MQT. Exception: Pilots undergoing Phase 2
      or Phase 3 training must be supervised by an instructor; however, direct supervision is
      not required.
      1.5.4.3. Senior officers as defined in AFI 11-202, Vol 1, and paragraph 2.7.
      1.5.4.4. Staff personnel whom the wing/group commander have determined require
      instructor supervision.
      1.5.4.5. Pilots, navigators, and flight engineers receiving air refueling training when
      within ¼ NM of tanker.
      1.5.4.6. Personnel undergoing Upgrade or Specialized training as defined in Chapter 5 or
      approved training plan. Exception: pilots in upgrade or specialized training only require
      direct supervision if the training is for skills required during critical phases of flight.
1.6. RAP Policy and Management:
   1.6.1. Each RAP qualification level is defined by a total number of RAP sorties, broken
   down into mission types, plus specific qualifications and currencies as determined by ACC
   and unit commanders.
   1.6.2. The total number of RAP sorties is the primary factor for maintaining an individual's
   qualification level. The breakout of sortie/mission types is provided as a guideline,
   variations in sortie/mission types may be used as a basis for determining qualification level.
   Qualification is determined by the SQ/CC in consideration of ACC guidance and
   crewmember capabilities.
   1.6.3. An effective RAP sortie requires accomplishment of a mission sortie. The RAP
   tasking memorandum takes precedence over Attachment 2 to determine crediting of a RAP
   sortie.
   1.6.4. The SQ/CC's first priority should be to train all designated crewmembers to CMR.
   1.6.5. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
      1.6.5.1. A 1-month lookback at the higher sortie rate.
      1.6.5.2. Qualification in all core missions required at CMR.
      1.6.5.3. Confirmation that the progressed crewmember can complete the prorated
      number of sortie/event requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle.
      1.6.5.4. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification
      or certification (see Table 4.1.).
      1.6.5.5. SQ/CC certification.
   1.6.6. CMR/BMC crewmembers will fly the required monthly sortie rate. If unable, refer to
   regression in paragraph 4.10.
 12                                              AFI11-2EC-130HV1 30 SEPTEMBER 2011


    1.6.7. Aircrew Experience Level. Experience levels identify the number of events needed by
    aircrews to maintain BAQ, BMC, or CMR. "Inexperienced" identifies crewmembers with
    less experience. They require additional training events to enhance their proficiency and
    remain CMR. "Experienced" aircrews have a higher level of expertise and require fewer
    repeat training events to maintain BMC/CMR status. The flying hour requirements for a
    crewmember to be considered experienced are listed in Table 1.1.
    1.6.8. Crewmembers are classified as ―inexperienced‖ when initially certified BMC/CMR by
    the squadron commander. Squadron commanders may reclassify crewmembers as
    ―experienced‖ when they meet minimum hours in Table 1.1. and demonstrate sufficient
    proficiency to handle the reduced continuation training requirements. Squadron training will
    document reclassification to ―experienced‖ in the crewmember’s training record.
    1.6.9. End-of cycle training requirements are based upon the crewmember's experience level
    on the last day of the current cycle. See Table 1.1. for definitions of crewmember
    experience.
    1.6.10. Units converting to another Mission Design System (MDS) or undergoing aircraft
    block modification may fly crewmembers in CMR positions at the BMC rate until one month
    prior to reaching initial operating capability (IOC) if the UTE rate will not support CMR
    sortie rates.
    1.6.11. The aircrew training cycle is based on the annual RAP cycle. Units will complete
    training requirements during the appropriate training cycle unless otherwise excepted.

1.7. Training Sortie Program Development:
   1.7.1. RAP sortie and event requirements (see Attachment 2 for definitions) apply to
   CMR/BMC aircrew as well as those carrying special capabilities or qualifications. The
   standard sortie requirements in the annual RAP tasking memorandum establishes the
   minimum number of sorties per training cycle for CMR/BMC levels of training. The annual
   RAP tasking memorandum takes precedence over this instruction, and may contain an
   updated sortie requirement or missions/events not yet incorporated into Attachment 2.
   1.7.2. Non-RAP requirements must be considered in addition to RAP requirements.
   1.7.3. Collateral or Cost-of-Business sortie requirements must be considered when
   developing unit flying hour programs. These sorties are not directly related to combat
   employment training but are necessary in day-to-day unit operations. These include, but are
   not limited to, ferry flights, incentive/orientation flights, deployments, and air shows. For
   each annual RAP training cycle, HQ ACC should allocate a block of sorties to each unit for
   these purposes.
   1.7.4. Unit flying hour programs are allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate
   for non-effective training. Attrition sorties are logged when a training sortie, RAP or non-
   RAP, is planned but a major portion of training valid for that mission is not accomplished.
   Attrition can be caused by poor weather, air aborts, etc. In order to accurately allocate the
   number of attrition sorties, it is essential that attrition sorties are logged appropriately.
1.8. Training Records and Reports:
   1.8.1. Units will maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations IAW the
   following instructions, as supplemented:
      1.8.1.1. AFI 11-202, Vol 1, Aircrew Training.
      1.8.1.2. AFI 11-202, Vol 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.

      Training Programs.
      1.8.1.6. AFI 36-2201 Vol. 1-6, Air Force Training.
   1.8.2. Track the following information for all aircrew:
      1.8.2.1. Ground training.
      1.8.2.2. Accomplished individual sorties, RAP sorties, sortie types, and events
      cumulatively for the AEF training cycle.
      1.8.2.3. RAP sortie accomplishments using 1-month and 3-month running totals for
      lookback.
      1.8.2.4. Currencies.
   1.8.3. Permanent Flying Training Folders will be maintained IAW the above listed
   regulations and will reside in the respective operational flying squadron training office. To
   preclude unauthorized access, folders will be under positive control at all times. The AF

   Form 614, Charge Out Record, will be used any time the training folder is removed from the
   42 ECS. Upon PCA/PCS to another flying unit an AFORMS printout will be placed in the
   permanent flying training record and the record will be hand-carried to the gaining unit.
       1.8.3.1. The DMAFB Form 92, Grade Book Cover, will be placed on the outside of the
       training folder with all required data completed. The folder will be divided into four
       sections. Six-part folders will be used. The folder will be arranged as follows:

   1.9.1. Commanders should ensure wing/group tactical crewmembers (API-1/2/6/A/Bs) fill
   authorized positions IAW UMD and that aircrew status is properly designated. The overall
   objective is that crewmembers perform combat-related duties. Supervisors may assign
   crewmembers to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, mishap board member, etc.) but must
   continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of aircrew tasking, flying proficiency,
   and experience. Inexperienced crewmembers in the first year of initial operational
   assignment will be limited to duties directly related to combat/combat training activities.
   1.9.2. Commanders will ensure wing/group staff crewmembers (API-6/Bs) perform duties
   justified in HQ ACC manpower standards documents and authorized in UMDs.
   1.9.3. Crewmembers will not perform long-term duties that detract from the primary duties
   of training for, or performing, the unit flying mission.
1.10. Sortie Allocation Guidance:
   1.10.1. Inexperienced API-1/2/A crewmembers should receive sortie allocation priority over
   experienced crewmembers. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
      1.10.1.1. Operational Units. CMR/API-1/2/A, MQT API-1/2/A, CMR API-6/B, MQT
      API-6/B, BMC (to include API-5 aircrew physicians).
   1.10.2. Wing API-6/B flying authorizations are IAW UMDs.
   1.10.3. API-8/D (above wing level) flying authorizations will be IAW AFI 11-401 and HQ
   ACC guidance. These individuals will fly the BMC rate, but are not required to complete
   BMC specific missions/events or meet monthly lookback requirements. Non-RAP
   requirements will be accomplished within the BMC number of sorties. Wings are allocated
   flying hours for attached API-8/Ds.
1.11. Waiver Authority:
   1.11.1. With MAJCOM/A3 approval, waiver authority for all requirements of the RAP
   tasking memo is the OG/CC. Additional guidance may be provided in the memo. Unless
   specifically noted otherwise in the appropriate section, and also with MAJCOM/A3 approval,
   the OG/CC may adjust individual requirements in Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and Chapter 6, on a
   case-by-case basis, to accommodate variations in aircrew member experience and
   performance. For all other provisions of this volume, and IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 1, the
   waiver authority is MAJCOM/A3. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as
   specified in the supplement and approved through higher level coordination authority.
   1.11.2. Units subordinate to a NAF will forward requests directly to ACC/A3I and provide
   their NAF/A3 with an informational copy. Follow the format as listed in Attachment 6.

   scenarios. SEPTs should be accomplished in crew-sized groups so all members may fully
   participate. An abnormal or emergency situation should be presented and the crew should
   discuss actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry it to a logical conclusion.
   Discussion of affected system indications, effects on other systems, aircraft performance,
   mission degradation, and crew coordination should be included. Emergency procedures and
   special interest items should be emphasized.
       4.2.6.1. SEPT discussions are normally conducted on the ground, but continuation of the
       training may be conducted in flight on a limited basis IAW the restrictions of paragraph
       A4.13. These airborne SEPTs will be tailored to the particular SEPT discussed during
       preflight planning.
       4.2.6.2. Document SEPT accomplishment on the Go/No-go portion of FCIF review.
       Crewmembers will not fly unsupervised unless a SEPT was accomplished during the
       current or previous month.

       applicable. In addition, they will comply with currencies in Table 4.4. for events in
       which they are qualified. For instructors, failure to accomplish these requirements will
       not affect instructor qualification, but will require additional training as required by the
       SQ/CC prior to resuming instructor duties in the delinquent event(s). EXCEPTION:
       Crewmembers not AAR-qualified are not required to complete AAR currencies shown in
       Table 4.4.
       4.3.9.2. Mission and instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2,
       and AFI 11-2 EC-130H, Vol 2.
   4.3.10. Supervisory Aircrew Personnel Requirements. Senior Officer training will be IAW
   AFI 11-202, Vol 1. This paragraph applies to colonel selects and above occupying positions
   designated as requiring operational flying. This paragraph does not apply to colonel selects
   and above assigned to a standardization and evaluation function.
       4.3.10.1. Supervisory personnel who accomplish a senior officer’s course will fly under
       the direct supervision of an instructor if required by their AF Form 8.
       4.3.10.2. Senior officers assigned or attached for flying to EC-130H units will maintain
       BAQ status, but may be designated BMC. These officers will be designated as
       experienced and maintain 50 percent of BAQ/BMC RAP/non-RAP requirements and all
       currencies.
          4.3.10.2.1. Senior Officers who maintain standard BMC/CMR requirements may fly
          in unrestricted status.
       4.3.10.3. Commanders and their deputies who supervise EC-130H units, and are
       qualified in another aircraft they supervise, may fly under the direct supervision of an
       instructor. Direct supervision is not required for individuals who have obtained multiple
       MDS qualification in the EC-130H IAW with AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
4.4. Special Categories:
   4.4.1. Flight Surgeon flying rates and requirements and currencies are IAW AFI 11-202, Vol
   1.
   4.4.2. ACC and NAF API-8/D crewmembers performing aircrew duties:
       4.4.2.1. Higher Headquarter (HHQ) personnel will pre-coordinate with the supporting
       unit and be in appropriately coded API billets in order to fly, unless supporting a formal
       inspection. ACC division chiefs or the NAF/A3 are reviewing authorities for assigned
       personnel. ACC/NAF will:
          4.4.2.1.1. Coordinate with the supporting agency to ensure appropriate ARMS data is
          maintained and provided IAW AFI 11-401.
          4.4.2.1.2. Review attached crewmember accomplishments and currencies prior to
          authorizing participation in training.
          4.4.2.1.3. Provide each crewmember with written documentation specifying the
          sortie types and events the individual is authorized to fly.
       4.4.2.2. HHQ flying personnel maintaining EC-130H BMC status are exempt from
       continuation ground training affecting BMC. These individuals will be designated as
AFI11-2EC-130HV1 30 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               31


       experienced and fly all annual RAP/non-RAP requirements at 50% of the BMC rate. All
       event currencies apply.
   4.4.3. ACC-assigned Flight Test Engineers (FTE). FTEs are engineers or scientists
   occupying duty positions requiring them to conduct or participate in flight test missions on a
   regular basis. These personnel are on aeronautical orders, hold an AFSC of X61S or X62E,
   and have an aviation service code of 9D. FTEs are authorized to log time as primary
   crewmembers when performing duties IAW AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning
   Factors. FTEs may fly to maintain proficiency and improve knowledge in employment of
   the weapon system, when not performing test duties. FTEs will be attached to one of the
   operational COMPASS CALL squadrons for flying if primary aircraft is the EC-130H.
       4.4.3.1. FTE Initial Ground Training. FTEs are exempt from academic ground training,
       periodic exams, all mobility training, and special training programs within authorized
       mission areas. In lieu of the flight evaluation, FTEs will complete the flight surgeon
       closed book exam. FTEs will complete grounding items in Table 4.2. and LL01 prior to
       first flight. FTEs assigned/attached to units, who have not flown unit-assigned aircraft in
       the past, will be given an Aircraft/Mission System overview by an instructor MCC prior
       to flight. Training completed during previous flying assignments may count towards
       AFE and SERE requirements when training is similar in nature. FTEs are encouraged,
       not required, to attend COMPASS CALL mission crew academic courses.
       4.4.3.2. FTE Initial Flying Training. The first flight in the unit-assigned aircraft will be
       with an Instructor MCC and may be flown in conjunction with other training sorties. The
       briefing and sortie will emphasize crew coordination, aircraft egress, communications,
       emergency equipment, normal mission timing/checklist items, and mission equipment
       use. Upon completion of the flight, the FTE will be considered mission qualified for test
       and training missions.
       4.4.3.3. FTE Recurring Training. Consider FTEs with more than 6 months of flying as
       experienced. Maintain the training requirements in Table 4.2. and basic sortie currency
       in Table 4.4. Upon loss of currency, the next flight must be with a mission crew
       instructor.
4.5. Difference Qualification:
   4.5.1. Difference qualification is normally conducted when training in a different series
   aircraft in the same MDS. Difference qualification will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202, Vol
   1.
   4.5.2. All C-130 variants except C-130Js are considered the same MDS. Completion of
   difference training, as defined in paragraph 1.4.1.1.1., certifies pilots, navigators, and flight
   engineers in the EC-130H as ―basic‖ (FP, FN, FF). Training and certification will be
   documented in individual training records. Difference training is normally accomplished
   concurrently with the Phase 2 syllabus.
       4.5.2.1. Certification to fly non-mission, training aircraft is documented in individual
       training records and tracked on the unit letter of certification. Minimum requirements for
       certification will include the following:
 32                                              AFI11-2EC-130HV1 30 SEPTEMBER 2011


            4.5.2.1.1. Pilots, navigators, and flight Engineers will receive a ground training
            session with a qualified instructor crewmember in the same specialty. Scanners will
            perform a preflight and a ground review of checklists with an instructor AMT.
            4.5.2.1.2. Navigators who are not certified to fly on aircraft without the Computer
            Aided Navigation System (CANS) require one flight with an instructor navigator.
4.6. Baseline Certification. This section applies to future baseline versions of COMPASS
CALL. The OSS in conjunction with 42 ECS will develop Baseline Certification Training Plans
to outline required training for all crewmembers.
   4.6.1. Crewmembers may be certified in multiple baselines of EC-130H aircraft with
   squadron commander approval, after completion of required certification training. Baseline
   certification accomplished in IQT/MQT will be documented in individual training records.
   4.6.2. Once baseline-certified in another baseline of the EC130H, all RAP, non-RAP, and
   currency requirements may be logged in any baseline.
4.7. Currency/Recurrency:
   4.7.1.

Table 4.4. defines flying currency requirements for all EC-130H crewmembers.
   4.7.2. Crewmembers are non-current the day currency expires (i.e. an event with a 45 day
   currency completed on 4 January becomes non-current on 19 February).
   4.7.3. Recurrency. When the crewmember is non-current in an event for up to 6 months,
   currency may be regained by demonstrating proficiency under the direct supervision of a
   current instructor of same crew position. The non-current event must be completed as
   defined in Attachment 2.
      4.7.3.1. A mission crewmember may regain Basic Sortie currency under the supervision
      of any crew position instructor, if current in all other areas.
   4.7.4. Loss of qualification. Loss of currency for more than 6 months will affect
   qualification as described below. For those events which result in a loss of qualification,
   requalification must be accomplished as directed in AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
      4.7.4.1. Loss of currency for more than 6 months in any event making the crewmember
      non-current in the aircraft results in loss of basic qualification. A QUAL evaluation must
      be accomplished to regain basic qualification. These items are identified in Table 4.4.
      with Note 3.
      4.7.4.2. Loss of mission sortie or AMT preflight currency for more than 6 months results
      in loss of mission qualification. A MSN evaluation must be accomplished.
      4.7.4.3. Loss of pilot AAR currency for more than 6 months makes the pilot unqualified
      for AAR. Qualification will be regained on an in-flight evaluation (SPOT or MSN).
      4.7.4.4. Loss of currency in any other event does not affect qualification. Retraining and
      recurrency will be at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
   4.7.5. Ground Training. Overdue ground training requirements must be satisfied before a
   crewmember is considered qualified and current to perform tasks applicable to that type of
AFI11-2EC-130HV1 30 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                           33


   training. Ground training annotated as affecting CMR status requires regression to NCMR
   until completion of training required by this instruction or SQ/CC, as applicable. Ground
   training not affecting CMR status does not require regression from CMR, although it may
   result in grounding until training is completed (e.g. aircrew flight equipment currency
   training). Duration of grounding and status of sortie lookback will determine the effect on
   CMR status.
4.8. Event Credit:
   4.8.1. Credit events accomplished on satisfactory qualification, requalification, instrument,
   mission, and special mission evaluations towards individual training and currency
   requirements.
   4.8.2. BAQ Flight Crew undergoing Phase 2 training will log non-RAP events listed in
   Tables 4.3. and 4.4. if accomplished during Phase 2 flights.
4.9. Regression:
   4.9.1. CMR/BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. Lookback requirements are
   listed in Table 4.5. These rates are fixed and independent of the RAP tasking memorandum
   which sets an annual 12-month cycle rate for sortie accomplishment.
      4.9.1.1. RAP lookback requirements will be treated as an ongoing process independent
      of annual RAP training cycle. Crewmembers who meet 1-month and 3-month lookback
      requirements without completing annual RAP training cycle requirements will be handled
      IAW paragraph 4.10.
      4.9.1.2. Non-RAP events may not be used for lookback.
      4.9.1.3. Failure to meet 1-month sortie lookback requires a review of the crewmember's
      3month sortie history. If the 3-month sortie lookback has been met, the SQ/CC may
      allow the individual to remain CMR/BMC. Failure to meet this 3-month lookback
      requires the SQ/CC to either regress the individual to N-CMR/N-BMC (as applicable),
      place the individual on probation for 1 month, remove the crewmember from a CMR
      manning position, or initiate action to remove the crewmember from active flying status.
      If probation is chosen, the only way to remove the individual from probation and
      preserve current status is to reestablish a 1-month lookback at the end of the probation
      period (see Figure 4.1). Probation and regression will be documented in the individual’s
      training record by Memorandum for Record following the sample formats in Attachment
      7.
      4.9.1.4. CMR/BMC crewmembers regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC for lookback must
      complete a SQ/CC-approved recertification program that ensures the individual returns to
      CMR/BMC standards. As a minimum, this will consist of one RAP sortie. Upon
      completion of the recertification program, CMR/BMC crewmembers must also meet the
      subsequent 1-month lookback requirement prior to reclaiming CMR/BMC status. The
      sorties and events accomplished during the recertification program will be credited
      towards their total sortie and event requirements for the training cycle, as well as their
      monthly sortie requirement.
      4.9.1.5. Lookback computations begin after designation as CMR/BMC. Crewmembers
      must maintain 1-month lookback requirements until a 3-month lookback is established.

   4.9.2. Crewmembers who fail a qualification, instrument, or mission evaluation will be
   handled IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and AFI 11-2EC-130H, Vol 2. These individuals will
   regress to NCMR/N-BMC, as applicable, and will remain in N-CMR/N-BMC status until
   successfully completing required corrective action, reevaluation, and recertification by the
   SQ/CC.
   4.9.3. See figure 4.1 for regression flow chart.
4.10. End-of-Cycle Requirements:
   4.10.1. Crewmembers failing to complete sortie and/or event requirements by the end of the
   training cycle may require additional training. Paragraph 4.11 directs proration criteria.
   Mass training shortfalls must be reported IAW paragraph 1.2.3.5.
   4.10.2. Crewmembers failing to meet total annual non-RAP sortie/event requirements are
   considered noncurrent for the sorties/events not completed and may not perform those
   sorties/events except under instructor supervision to regain currency.      Recurrency
   requirements are listed in paragraph 4.7.
   4.10.3. Crewmembers failing to meet annual RAP training cycle requirements will be
   regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC unless lookback is maintained or the SQ/CC determines the
   deficiency is not significant. To regain CMR/BMC regressed crewmembers will complete
   all deficient events. Events may be counted against requirements for the new training cycle.
   4.10.4. Crewmembers failing to accomplish sorties/events required for special mission
   capabilities or qualifications will be considered non-current for those capabilities or
   qualifications and must perform those sorties/events under instructor supervision to regain
   currency.
4.11. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements: At the end of the annual RAP training cycle,
the SQ/CC may prorate all training requirements when on Duty Not Including Flying (DNIF), on
emergency leave, in a non-flying TDY/exercise, or when combat/contingency operations
preclude training for portions of the training period. Normal annual leave is not considered for
proration. Aircraft unavailability and extended bad weather precluding units from flying for
more than 15 consecutive days can be considered for proration.
   4.11.1. Proration is only used to adjust for genuine circumstances of non-availability, not to
   mask training or planning deficiencies. The following guidelines apply to proration of
   training:
       4.11.1.1. Determine number of months to prorate based on cumulative calendar days of
       non-availability for flying using Table 4.6.
       4.11.1.2. If Phase 1 or Phase 2 training must be re-accomplished, a crewmember's
       training cycle will start over at the prorated share of training remaining following
       completion of Phase 3.
       4.11.1.3. Round prorated fractions less than 0.5 to next lower whole number, not lower
       than one.
       4.11.1.4. Crewmembers achieving CMR/BMC after the 15th of the month will be
       considered to be in CT the first day of the following month for proration purposes. Use
       Table 4.7. to determine the prorated share of training.
AFI11-2EC-130HV1 30 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                         35


      4.11.1.5. A crewmember's last month on station prior to departing PCS may be prorated.
      Individuals departing PCS may be considered CMR for reporting purposes for up to
      60 days after last flight, until loss of CMR currency, port call, or sign-in at new duty
      station.

        4.11.1.6. CMR crewmembers attending USAF Weapons School (USAFWS) courses in
        TDY and return status and/or participating in actual flying contingency operations may
        be reported as CMR. Upon return, those crewmembers will accomplish a prorated share
        of sortie/event requirements.
     4.11.2. Contingency Operations:
        4.11.2.1. Sorties flown during contingency operations may be logged as mission sorties.
        These sorties and RAP events logged do not count toward annual RAP requirements, but
        may be used for lookback purposes and to update currencies. Units may prorate RAP
        sorties and events for the period of time each individual was deployed. Proration is
        authorized for deployment preparation and deployment recovery time where home station
        flying is reduced by ACC.
        4.11.2.2. The ECG/CC is authorized to allow contingency sorties which provide valid
        training to be logged as RAP sorties. Events accomplished on contingency sorties may
        count toward RAP event requirements, provided the events meet mission/event
        definitions listed in Attachment 2. These sorties/events may not be prorated upon return
        to home station.
        4.11.2.3. Proration is computed by subtracting the number of valid RAP sorties/events
        flown and logged, as authorized by the ECG/CC, from the sorties/events to be prorated
AFI11-2EC-130HV1 30 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                               37


       for the deployment. Negative numbers equate to zero. EXAMPLE: Capt Smith, an
       inexperienced CMR pilot, deployed for 62 days. During that time 5 of 16 sorties he flew
       met the definition of a mission sortie in Attachment 2. The squadron/CC elected to
       prorate his requirements for that time period. He can be prorated for 2 months based on
       62 days deployed, according to Table 4.2. This equates to 2 mission sorties of the 14
       required, according to Table 4.6. Since he logged 5 mission sorties, the difference is
       negative 3, and no proration is allowed.
4.12. Retraining. AFI 11-202, Vol 1, specifies retraining restriction before separation,
retirement, or mandatory inactive flying status.

                                          Chapter 5

                       UPGRADE AND SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. General. This chapter contains information for specialized training and upgrade. This
training applies to crewmembers upgrading to instructor or flight examiner, positional upgrades,
and AME training.
5.2. Upgrade Training Time Limits. Crew members upgrading to instructor must complete
training within 120 days of the class start date. Exceeding 120 days requires notification to
ACC/A3 through ACC/A3I with name, rank, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated
completion date.
5.3. C-130 FTU Training Quota Management. 42 ECS/DTC will manage ECG training
quotas at the Basic C-130 FTU at Little Rock AFB. Squadron quarterly Training Review Boards
will submit requirements to 42 ECS/DTC for assignment.
   5.3.1. Shortages of available training quotas may require In-Unit Upgrade for courses taught
   at the Basic C-130 FTU at Little Rock AFB. Waiver requests for In-Unit administration of
   these courses should be sent to ACC/A3I IAW paragraph 1.11.5. using the format detailed in
   Attachment 6. Fill all available Basic C-130 FTU quotas prior to requesting waivers.
   5.3.2. Units must ensure that individuals completing In-Unit Upgrade incur an Active Duty
   Service Commitment IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC).
   5.3.3. Use only approved contract courseware to complete in-unit training.
5.4. Aircraft Commander (AC):
   5.4.1. General. Commanders will consider experience, knowledge, and judgment prior to
   certifying a pilot as an Aircraft Commander and designating a pilot as pilot-in-command on
   the flight authorization. Pilots will normally be certified as an AC after completion of
   Aircraft Commander MQT. However, for those awaiting training, certification is at the
   discretion of the SQ/CC after completion of aircraft difference training. In addition, cross-
   flow pilots must complete upgrade training designated in paragraph 5.4.3. prior to AC
   certification. All AC Certification will be documented in the individual’s training record.
       5.4.1.1. AC Candidacy. An AC candidate is an individual designated by the squadron
       commander for entry into training before a formal AC upgrade course. Commanders will
       consider pilot experience, knowledge, and judgment prior to identifying an individual as
       an AC Candidate. AC candidate certification is documented in the individual’s training
       record.
       5.4.1.2. Prior to designation as ―AC Candidate‖, pilots must:
           5.4.1.2.1. Complete the AC Upgrade Preparation Guide.
           5.4.1.2.2. Meet the flying hour prerequisites in Table 5.1. for AC Upgrade.
           5.4.1.2.3. AC candidates may fly in the left seat and perform most flight maneuvers
           authorized for a pilot under the direct supervision of an IP. See restrictions in
           Attachment 4. Direct IP supervision is not required during non-critical phases of
           flight.
AFI11-2EC-130HV1 30 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                            39


         5.4.1.2.4. Individuals enrolled in a formal AC upgrade course may perform flight
         maneuvers authorized for a pilot under direct supervision of an IP. See restrictions in
         Attachment 4.
  5.4.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD).
     5.4.2.1. MPD Graduate Continuation Training. Units should seek to optimize the mix
     and volume of MPD Graduate training during their upgrade process to aircraft
     commander. The entire time from completion of Phase 2 training to aircraft commander
     certification should focus on the skills required to be a EC-130H aircraft commander.
     This includes both left- and right-seat skills and duties. Unit commanders and operations
     officers should fly MPD Graduates in either seat (within restrictions outlined in the
     supplement to this instruction) to develop balanced skills, and maintain accurate
     quantitative and qualitative data to monitor individual progress.
         5.4.2.1.1. MPD Graduates will receive a unit-specific Aircraft Commander Upgrade
         Preparation Guide upon initial Phase 3 qualification. Supervisors will monitor
         progression through the guide, training continuity, and quality of training. MPD
         Graduates must demonstrate complete and in-depth knowledge to earn a subject
         matter signature in the Aircraft Commander Upgrade Preparation Guide.
         5.4.2.1.2. Mix and Volume of Flying Training. Units should season MPD Graduates
         in both seats while achieving an overall flight-hour goal to allow the pilot to upgrade
         to AC in 24 to 26 months. Items of interest include type of mission and left-seat
         versus rightseat time. Pilot proficiency and mission sorties should aim for equal seat
         distribution. Attempt to give MPD Graduates as much practice in the contact position
         as possible. See AFI 11-2EC-130H, Vol 2, for flight evaluation guidance.
         5.4.2.1.3. Tracking Progress. Units should seek sufficient data to monitor MPD
         Graduate progress. The responsibility for this feedback begins with the line instructor
         pilots and aircraft commanders who fly training and operational missions with them
         during the 24/26-month upgrade. Training offices should immediately enter MPD
         Graduates into a training program to monitor their progress. Document this progress
         in individual training records. A periodic instructor pilot progress sortie, culminating
         in a Form 206, should be scheduled to provide formal feedback to the MPD Graduate.
         Squadron schedulers should attempt to schedule MPD Graduates on a variety of
         mission types for the progress sortie.
     5.4.2.2. MPD Graduates will upgrade to AC via either the CCALLACMPD TOP-OFF or
     the AETC C-130 AC Upgrade course. If upgrade is completed via the AETC C-130 AC
     Upgrade course, pilots will complete the mission and air-to-air refueling flying portions
     of the CCALLACMPD TOP-OFF. Upon completion, pilots will be given an in-flight
     mission evaluation. These pilots may be AC certified by the SQ/CC upon successful
     completion of the mission evaluation.
  5.4.3. Cross-flow Pilot Upgrade Plan. After completion of Phase 2 training, enter cross-flow
  pilots in the following training program, designed to season and experience them as EC-
  130H pilots. Normally, these individuals will not be restricted to the right seat as left-seat
  experience is vital to progression. When flying in the left seat, cross-flow pilots will be
  under the direct supervision of an instructor during critical phases of flight.

         5.4.3.1. With SQ/DO recommendation and SQ/CC certification, cross-flow pilots may be
         certified as Aircraft Commanders upon completion of this training program and attaining
         100 hours EC-130H primary/secondary time as mission pilot. Document training and
         certification in the individual’s training record.
             5.4.3.1.1. Academic training will be defined in the ECG supplement to this volume.
             At a minimum, the cross-flow flight training consists of the following events prior to
             certification as Aircraft Commander:
                  5.4.3.1.1.1. Three mission events flown in the right seat performing copilot
                  duties.
                  5.4.3.1.1.2. One AAR event flown in the right seat performing copilot duties.
                  5.4.3.1.1.3. Three pilot proficiency events flown in the right seat and two flown
                  in the left seat under instructor supervision.
         5.4.3.2. Cross-flow pilots may log RAP and non-RAP events and currencies in either
         seat prior to Aircraft Commander certification.

5.9. Additional Event Training/Certification.
   5.9.1. Air-to-Air Refueling. Training will normally be accomplished in conjunction with
   Phase 2. If not accomplished in Phase 2, designation as CMR will be after AAR
   Qualification. When training is conducted outside ACC formal Phase 2 syllabi, squadrons
   will use the flying portion of the syllabi for AAR qualification. AAR requires evaluation
   IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and AFI 11-2 EC-130H, Vol 2.
   5.9.2. Touch-and-Go Landings. Touch-and-go landings are a qualification item for all
   Aircraft Commanders. They are evaluated on initial qualification evaluations and all
   recurring evaluations. However, aircraft commanders must be certified by their squadron
   commander to monitor an uncertified pilot’s touch-and-go landings. Certification will be
   documented in individual training records.
      5.9.2.1. Prior to certification, individuals must have 100 hours of primary or secondary
      flying time following Aircraft Commander certification in any C-130 MDS. In addition,
      Aircraft Commanders must complete the following training program:
          5.9.2.1.1. Successfully complete the 42 ECS administered touch-and-go test prior to
          the touch-and-go certification flight.
          5.9.2.1.2. One hour of ground training/preflight. Instructor pilots will discuss various
          EPs and unique situations encountered during touch-and-go landings.
          5.9.2.1.3. One Certification Flight with an instructor pilot. During this certification
          flight, the AC will perform a minimum of three touch-and-go landings. These
          landings will be a combination of pilot-flying and pilot-monitoring duties while
          executing 100% and 50% flap configuration touch-and-go landings. In addition, the
          instructor will fly a poorly executed approach to drive a go-around call. Emphasis
          will be placed on aircraft control and traffic pattern checklist discipline.
AFI11-2EC-130HV1 30 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                          45


     5.9.2.2. Aircraft Commanders, cross-flow pilots, and MPD Graduates may perform
     touch-and-go landings from either seat when the other seat is occupied by an Aircraft
     Commander certified to supervise touch-and-go landings.
  5.9.3. Commanders may identify other events for which they determine an additional
  certification and training is required. Channel requests for training plans and certification
