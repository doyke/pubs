SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Complete rewrite of this USAFA Instruction was required due to the implementation of the
Automated Time Attendance and Production System (ATAAPS) at USAFA in November 2013.
Despite USAFA using the electronic management tracking system (eMTS) at the time, the use of
ATAAPS was mandated Air Force-wide.
1. ATAAPS users and actions required to access ATAAPS. (T-3).
     1.1. ATAAPS employee users who do not approve time and attendance of other employees.
     The quick reference guide is available on the Headquarters (HQ) USAFA financial
     management              (FM)           SharePoint      web            site         at
     https://eis.usafa.edu/centers/finance/default.aspx.
     1.2. ATAAPS Civilian Supervisors who also approve time and attendance of other
     employees. The quick reference guide is available on the HQ USAFA/FM SharePoint web
     site.
     1.3. ATAAPS Military Supervisors who approve time and attendance of APF civilian
     employees. The quick reference guide is available on the HQ USAFA/FM SharePoint web
     site.
     1.4. ATAAPS Timekeepers. The quick reference guide is available on the HQ USAFA/FM
     SharePoint web site.
2. Appointment of time and attendance approving officials. (T-0).
     2.1. Under Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR), civilian pay appointment of
     time and attendance approving officials on DD Form 577, Appointment/Termination Record
     – Authorized Signature, is required IAW Department of Defense Financial Management
     Regulation (DoDFMR) Volume 5, Chapter 33 and Volume 8, Chapter 2. The Commander or
     Director appoints time and attendance Approving Officials (AOs) using DD Form 577.
     Delegation from the commander/director is limited to the vice commander and deputy
     directors, however, this delegation must be in writing and maintained in the unit for audit
     purposes. No further delegation is authorized.
     2.2. The USAFA template for the DD Form 577 is available on the HQ USAFA/FM
     SharePoint site at https://eis.usafa.edu/centers/finance/default.aspx. Appointment letters
     are not authorized. The Approving Official (AO) ensures, to the best of their knowledge, all
     employees' time and attendance records along with all supporting documents, e.g., leave,
     overtime, and compensatory time, are accurate and available for review. Copies of all DD
     Forms 577 for AOs are forwarded to the USAFA Finance Customer Service Representative
     (CSR)/Payroll Office at usafa.fmtaskers@us.af.mil. Each USAFA unit must review
     appointment of AOs annually for validity and currency by the appointing authorities.
     Appointments remain in force until terminated by reassignment or for cause using section IV
     of the form, and sending an electronic copy to usafa.fmtaskers@us.af.mil. This
     responsibility may not be further delegated to employees or administrative staff
     members. Only electronically completed and signed DD Forms 577 will be accepted, no
     manual signatures will be allowed.
USAFAI65-102 9 APRIL 2014                                                                       3


3. Files maintenance requirements. (T-0).
   3.1. The following tables and rules are applicable for the forms identified below.
      3.1.1. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 71, Request for Leave or Approved
      Absence, is embedded within ATAAPS. The OPM 71 will be used in ATAAPS as it
      meets the required documentation for audit purposes under the Financial Improvement
      and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirements. Separate unit files for leave requests are not
      required if ATAAPS is used for leave request and approval. Reference Secretary of the
      Air Force (SAF) FM and Air Force (AF) Personnel (A1) memorandum dated 8 April
      2013, SUBJECT: Time and Attendance Policies for Civilian Pay Audit Readiness, at
      attachment 2, figure A2.1. Any leave approved outside of ATAAPS must be on the
      unit’s file plan using RDS table and rule T 65 - 22 R 02.00 or R 04.00 depending on the
      specific unit procedures.
      3.1.2. The AF Form 428, Request for Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay and
      Compensatory Time, embedded in ATAAPS, for approval of overtime, holiday premium
      pay or compensatory time, does not meet the AF FIAR requirements or the USAFA
      requirements IAW AFI 36-802_USAFASUP. The AF Form 428 is required to be
      completed for all overtime, holiday premium pay and compensatory time and submitted
      to HQ USAFA Financial Management Analysis (FMA) for fund certification. Units must
      maintain all AF Forms 428 in their files for audit purposes. The appropriate RDS table
      and rule is T 65 – 22 R 03.00 and retention is for six years.
      3.1.3. Military leave (orders) and court leave (jury duty) must also be retained by the unit
      under RDS table and rule T 65 – 22 R 03.00 for six years. Copies must be submitted to
      HQ USAFA financial management finance (FMF), civilian pay, for validation purposes
      and update of the defense civilian pay system (DCPS). If copies are not received the
      military or court leave will be changed to annual leave.
      3.1.4. The DD Form 577, Appointment/Termination Record – Authorized Signature, is
      used for the appointment and termination of civilian or military personnel authorized by
      the commander or director to approve employee time and attendance. The DD Form 577
      must also be retained in the unit using RDS table and rule T 65 – 18 R 06.00. Maintain
      the DD Form 577 for six years after termination of appointment. All personnel (military
      or civilian) shall be terminated when no longer performing duties as an ATAAPS
      certifier. This includes retirement, separation or when these individuals move within the
      unit or to another unit or base.
      3.1.5. The AF Form 3821, Employee Accounting Classification – Defense Civilian Pay
      System – Base Level, is initiated by a new or transferred employee and coordinated
      through the gaining unit resource advisor and forwarded to HQ USAFA/FMA for
      retention purposes. Unit retention of this document is not required but is encouraged.
      Use RDS table and rule T 33 – 45 R 09.00 and retain records until the Air Force Records
      Officer approves a disposition that adequately describes the records and has the proper
      disposition assigned.
      3.1.6. Timekeepers completing the DD Form 2875, System Authorization Access Request
      (SAAR), and the DD Form 2929, Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS) Non-Payroll
      Office Access Form for DCPS access will forward these documents to HQ USAFA/FMF
 4                                                               USAFAI65-102 9 APRIL 2014


        (civilian pay). Civilian pay will forward these documents to the Defense Finance and
        Accounting Service (DFAS) for system access and retain a copy in the civilian pay files
        maintenance plan. Units must also retain the DD Form 2875 and DD Form 2929 for
        FIAR audit purposes. The appropriate RDS table and rule is T 33 – 45 R 09.00 and these
        records must be maintained until the Air Force Records Officer approves a disposition
        that adequately describes the records and has the proper disposition assigned.
4. Overtime Requests and Approval. (T-0).
     4.1. The Air Force policy on overtime is contained in AFI 36-802, Pay Setting. The USAFA
     policy on overtime is contained in AFI 36-802_USAFASUP, Pay Setting, Chapter 3. It is
     essential that organizations implement overtime policies which establish internal controls and
     procedures for approving overtime. These measures help the Air Force document and
     enforce prudent overtime usage and funds management. Supervisors, not the employee, must
     obtain approval from their organization’s overtime authorizing official before directing
     overtime on the AF Form 428. An AF Form 428 must be completed for each period of
     overtime. Only in emergencies may supervisors direct overtime through verbal or other
     communication. In the case of emergency overtime, supervisors must follow-up with
     submitting the AF Form 428 no later than the following workday. Supervisors are
     responsible for ensuring compliance with overtime policy and procedures IAW AFI 36-802
     and AFI 36-802_USAFASUP. This responsibility may not be further delegated to
     employees or administrative staff members.
        4.1.1. The “Premium Request” feature in ATAAPS for approval of overtime, holiday
        premium pay or compensatory time currently does not meet AF FIAR requirements or
        the USAFA requirements in AFI 36-802_USAFASUP. The AF Form 428 is required to
        be completed for all premium pay. Follow the guidance in the AFI 36-802_USAFASUP
        for completing the AF Form 428 which includes submitting to USAFA/FMA for fund
        certification.
5. Contingency operations if ATAAPS becomes non-operational. (T-3).
     5.1. In cases where ATAAPS is non-operational for a short period of time our first option is
     for HQ USAFA/FMF to instruct DFAS to code all USAFA T&A as being worked and
     require USAFA approving officials to update time and attendance information when
     ATAAPS returns to operational status.
     5.2. In cases where ATAAPS is non-operational for extended periods of time, normally
     more than two weeks, HQ USAFA/FMF will require USAFA unit timekeepers to input
     manual Time and Attendance (T&A) forms into DCPS.
        5.2.1. USAFA T&A forms used for input of T&A information into DCPS shall have a
        form number. Without a form number assigned, the T&A form is invalid. The T&A
        forms require minimum data element values with one of the data elements being the
        Social Security Number (SSN). The minimum data element values required on the T&A
        form are in Chapter 2 of the DoDFMR 7000.14-R, Volume 8, Civilian Pay Policies and
        Procedures. Any form collecting information covered by the Privacy Act, such as the
        SSN, must be managed as a prescribed form. A prescribed form requires a prescribing
        publication in accordance with Chapter 3 of AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
        Management. The USAFA Form 65, Time and Attendance Record (Option 1), USAFA
USAFAI65-102 9 APRIL 2014                                                                         5


       Form 65-1, Time and Attendance Record (Option 2), USAFA Form 65-2, Time and
       Attendance Record (Option 3), and USAFA Form 65-3, Time and Attendance Record
       (Option 4), were developed for employees, supervisors and timekeepers to ensure a
       prescribed form is used. This prescribing publication directs organizations and
       individuals to use one of the prescribed forms effective the date of this instruction,
       however, these forms may only be used when contingency operations are necessary.
          5.2.1.1. When approved to use the manual USAFA forms under paragraph 5.2.
          above, USAFA organizations are required to maintain the Civilian T&A forms. The
          certified T&A form (e.g., the initialed and signed copy or electronic signatures of
          employee and supervisor) and any supporting documentation must be filed in such a
          manner as to make them easily retrievable for audit purposes. They may be
          maintained by the supervisor or the unit timekeeper. Whoever maintains the forms
          for the unit must ensure they are added to the unit file plan under RDS table and rule
          T-65 - 22, R 03.00, and maintained IAW the specific table and rule disposition. Use
          of the electronic capability of the USAFA Forms 65 allows for electronic storage of
          T&A information on the “O” Drive. Consult with your unit records custodian for
          additional information.
6. Court and military leave. (T-0).
   6.1. Appropriated fund civilian employees, supervisors of civilian employees and
   organizational timekeepers shall comply with the DoDFMR for reporting court and military
   leave.
   6.2. Court leave (LC). Civilian employees are authorized court leave when summoned to
   serve as a juror (5 U.S.C. 6322). Court leave is also authorized when summoned to appear as
   a witness in a nonofficial capacity on behalf of any party in connection with any judicial
   proceeding to which the United States or a state or local government is a party. Court leave
   is coded as LC in ATAAPS.
       6.2.1. Documentation: Civilian employees present a court order, subpoena, or summons
       to their supervisor and timekeeper to confirm their upcoming court absence. Upon return
       from juror or witness duty the civilian employee presents the Juror Service Certificate
       (JSC) to the supervisor and timekeeper. The employee is responsible to request and
       receive the JSC from the Clerk of the Court and provide a legible copy to the supervisor,
       timekeeper and the Finance CSR. The JSC must be received by the Finance CSR within
       14 calendar days after the end of the pay period in which the court leave occurred or the
       court leave will be changed to annual leave. When sufficient annual leave is not
       available, the employee will be charged leave without pay. The supervisor attaches a
       legible copy of the JSC to the employee’s timesheet for audit purposes.
       6.2.2. Retention of court fees. Fees received by the employee for jury and/or witness
       service may not be retained by the employee. These fees shall be turned over to the
       government using a money order or personal check, made payable to the “U.S.
       Treasury”. This remittance will include a legible copy of the JSC which identifies the fee
       received by the employee. An employee, serving on a jury in a state or local court, who
       waives or refuses to accept jury fees, is still liable to the U.S. Government for the fees he
       or she would have received. Reference DoDFMR volume 8, chapter 5, paragraph
       051310.
 6                                                               USAFAI65-102 9 APRIL 2014


     6.3. Military leave (LM). Employees may be authorized LM under Public Law 96-431, as
     codified at 5 U.S.C. 6323. Also reference DoDFMR volume 8, chapter 5, paragraph 0518.
        6.3.1. Documentation: When an employee is called to active, inactive or reserve duty
        training, the order directing the employee to perform military duty is provided to the
        supervisor and timekeeper to confirm the scheduled absence of the employee.
        Supervisors may code the employee’s timesheet with LM based on the applicable orders
        directing military training. Immediately forward these orders to the Finance CSR.
        Ensure the applicable orders or the record of individual performance contains dates of
        training to justify the employee’s absence. When written validation or charges to the
        orders are received after the training is completed, immediately forward this
        documentation to the Finance CSR. The appropriate documentation must be received by
        the Finance CSR within 14 calendar days after the end of the pay period in which the
        training session occurred or the military leave will be changed to annual leave. If
        sufficient annual leave is not available, the employee will be charged leave without pay.
        A legible copy of all supporting documentation for military leave must also be attached to
        the employee’s timesheet and retained in the organization for audit purposes.
     6.4. Documentation can be sent to HQ USAFA/FMF, faxed to 333-0282 or e-mailed to
     usafa.fmtaskers@us.af.mil. Please contact the Finance CSR at 333-2510 for assistance.
