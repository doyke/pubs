This Air Force Instruction (AFI) implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 99-1, Test and Evalua-
tion, by describing the forecasting, programming, unplanned requesting and reporting of munitions flight
termination systems and telemetry kits for test and evaluation. This AFI must be used in conjunction with
AFI 10-601, Operational Capability Requirements; AFI 63-101, Operations of Capabilities Based Acqui-
sition System; AFI 99-103, Capabilities Based Test And Evaluation; AFI 99-108, Programming and
Reporting Aerial Target and Missile Expenditures in Test and Evaluation; AFI 21-201, Conventional
Munitions Maintenance Management; and AFI 36-2217, Munitions Requirements for Aircrew Training.
Also consult the 16-series, 33-series, and 99-series AFIs for additional T&E direction. This publication
does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or Air National Guard Units. The purpose of this
AFI is to establish responsibilities, procedures and processes to forecast, allocate, program, and fund
munitions TIK and FTS required to support (live or inert) testing. Proper forecasting, with a correspond-
ing process to vet and validate TIK and FTS requirements, provides the basis for accurate submission of
funding requirements in the Program Objective Memorandum (POM). Additionally, this AFI defines a
process to prioritize TIK and FTS requirements. Based on actual budget funding received and number and
type of TIK and /or FTS procured, prioritization will allow for the most effective use of TIK and FTS
available. Since these kits are utilized with test munitions, the TIK and FTS forecasting process will be
linked with and complement the forecasting and allocation procedures for munitions as defined in AFI
21-201, AFI 36-2217 and AFI 99-108. Specific annual forecasting instructions will be included in the
Peacetime Conventional Ammunition Requirements (PCAR) instructions provided by the USAF Ammu-
nition Control Point (ACP). HQ USAF/TE is the sole waiver authority for policies in this AFI. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accor-
dance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

1. General.
    1.1. The Air Force has experienced a significant growth in the procurement and development of pre-
    cision guided air-to-ground (A/G) and air-to-air (A/A) weapons. The increased range, complexity and
    lethality of these weapons routinely require the use of a Telemetry (TM) Instrumentation Kit (TIK)
    and/or Flight Termination System (FTS) during developmental and operational test and evaluation as
    well as testing during sustainment. Examples include testing as listed in paragraphs 2.2.1. and 2.3.1.
    1.2. Forecasting and prioritization for TIK and FTS as defined in this AFI will begin in the next POM
    cycle immediately following publication. Availability of TIK and FTS in the short term will be limited
    to current program funding profiles.

2. Responsibilities.
    2.1. All testing must be planned and executed in close coordination with the Requirements and
    Acquisition Communities. Successful implementation of this instruction is incumbent upon close
    coordination between test organizations and parent headquarters, aircraft and weapon program man-
    agers, and applicable HAF offices in identification of TIK and FTS requirements. The significant
    costs of TIK and FTS necessitates that requirements are scrutinized and numbers validated at each
    level of review. The validation of TIK and FTS asset requirements used in developmental test will
    occur at the program office level.
    2.2. Program Managers (PM) (Aircraft and Weapon program offices):
       2.2.1. Develop program specific TIK and FTS requirements in consultation with test agencies and
       using MAJCOM. These requirements include TIK and FTS required for development test and
       evaluation (DT&E), live fire test and evaluation (LFT&E), lot acceptance test (LAT), qualification
       test and evaluation (QT&E), first article test (FAT), and regression testing.
       2.2.2. Ensure POM submittals include validated requirements. Non-DT&E TIK and FTS require-
       ments, such as described in paragraph 2.3.1., will be identified separately from DT&E require-
       ments to the appropriate agency in supporting documentation. (i.e., one line for DT&E TIK and
       FTS requirements and one line for non-DT&E TIK and FTS requirements.)
       2.2.3. Weapon program managers will provide TIK and FTS cost data, as required.
       2.2.4. Provide TIK and FTS based on actual funding allocated for TIK and FTS. This includes
       support for TIK and FTS installation, checkout, post-mission data reduction, and other required
       TIK/FTS support.
    2.3. Using MAJCOM:
       2.3.1. Using MAJCOM will direct subordinate test agencies to develop and submit TIK and FTS
       requirements for inclusion in the POM. AFOTEC is not a subordinate test agency and will submit
       their requirements to the appropriate MAJCOM/agency as stated in paragraph 2.4. MAJCOM
       requirements include TIK and FTS for force development evaluation (FDE), tactics development
       and evaluation (TD&E), weapon system evaluation program (WSEP), product acceptance test and
       evaluation (PAT&E) and tests associated with the Rapid Response Process (defined in AFI
       63-114) and other rapid acquisition programs.
       2.3.2. Validate TIK and FTS requirements by subordinate test organizations, prior to submittal to
       PM.
AFI99-120 1 MARCH 2007                                                                                 3


      2.3.3. Submit TIK and FTS requirements to PM with sufficient lead-time to account for TIK and
      FTS total production time and incorporation in appropriate POM submittal; advocate support for
      TIK and FTS requirements in the POM. Non-DT&E TIK and FTS requirements, such as
      described in paragraph 2.3.1., will be identified separately from DT&E requirements to the
      appropriate agency in supporting documentation. (i.e., one line for DT&E TIK and FTS require-
      ments and one line for non-DT&E TIK and FTS requirements.).
   2.4. AFOTEC. Provide TIK and FTS requirements to the supporting PM, MAJCOM or Air Staff for
   inclusion in the appropriate POM. AFOTEC requirements include, but are not limited to, TIK and
   FTS for initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E), qualification operational test and evaluation
   (QOT&E), follow-on test and evaluation (FOT&E) and multi-service operational test and evaluation
   (MOT&E).
   2.5. HQ USAF/TEP. Arbitrate limited TIK and FTS resources across MAJCOMs/AFOTEC in con-
   junction with HAF/A5R and SAF/AQP.

3. Programming and Funding Responsibilities.
   3.1. Use Table 1., Aircraft – Weapon Integration Programming and Funding Responsibilities
   Through IOC for TIK and FTS and Table 2., Post IOC Programming and Funding Responsibil-
   ities for TIK and FTS, to determine office of primary responsibility for programming and funding of
   TIK and FTS. Table 1. provides a summary of weapon and aircraft program office integration pro-
   gramming and funding responsibilities only through initial operational capability (IOC) of the new or
   increment weapon or aircraft. Guidance in Table 1. does not prevent program offices, MAJCOMs or
   AFOTEC from making separate temporary, documented funding agreements if required. Any funding
   agreement(s) should be governed by the principle that whoever is driving the need for the test should
   program and fund TIK and FTS. However, in the absence of any documented agreement, Table 1. will
   be used. The terms threshold and objective are used as defined in the Combined Joint Chiefs of Staff
   Instruction (CJCSI) 3170 series capabilities documents (Capabilities Development Document [CDD]
   or Capabilities Production Document [CPD]). See the glossary for definitions.

NOTES:
     1. To read this chart:
          a. Select the category of weapon or aircraft (either threshold or objective) and go to the
             respective section of the chart.
          b. Find the specific circumstance of weapon and aircraft integration in the left column.
AFI99-120 1 MARCH 2007                                                                                     5


          c. The word aircraft or weapon in the column on the right specifies who has funding
             responsibility for the TIK and/or FTS.
      2. Funding should be governed by the principle that whoever is driving the need for the test
         should program and fund TIK and FTS.
   3.2. Upon distribution of annual FY budget, program managers will ascertain the quantity of TIK and
   FTS that can be procured based on forecasted requirements and actual funding received.
   3.3. Programming and Funding Beyond IOC. See Table 2., Post IOC Programming and Fund-
   ing Responsibilities for TIK and FTS.
      3.3.1. For programs that require aircraft-weapon integration, if the integration test is a result of an
      aircraft change, the aircraft program is responsible for programming and funding, based on allo-
      cated funds. If the integration test is the result of a weapon change, the weapon program is respon-
      sible for programming and funding, based on allocated funds.
      3.3.2. As a life cycle system cost for sustainment weapons testing after weapon IOC, the weapons
      PM, through supporting MAJCOM, will program and fund TIK and FTS based on allocated funds
      in support of WSEP and LAT. Per paragraph 3.3.1., this responsibility falls to either the weapon
      PM or aircraft PM in support of FDE and TD&E dependent upon the program driving the integra-
      tion test need.

4. Unplanned Test Requirement Request
   4.1. Any agency requiring TIK and/or FTS not identified or funded in the annual requirements pro-
   cess will submit a request for the assets through their MAJCOM or program office (see Attachment
   2). These requests must be signed out at Group level (0-6 or equivalent), with complete justification
   and need date. The MAJCOM or program office (as appropriate) will validate the requirement and
   determine if it is a "must fill" requirement; if so, the MAJCOM or program office will make every
   effort to source required assets from within the MAJCOM or respective program. If assets cannot be
   sourced from within, the supporting MAJCOM will forward the request to HQ USAF/A5R with the
   most current TIK and FTS status. HQ USAF/A5R will coordinate with HQ USAF/TEP and SAF/AQP
   to assess the impacts and source assets based on priority of all available TIK and FTS. AFOTEC will
   validate their own unplanned test requirement requests at the O-6 level and forward their requirement
   through the supporting MAJCOM or to AF/TEP directly as appropriate. If the request is supported,
6                                                                        AFI99-120 1 MARCH 2007


    the support determination will address reimbursement for the replacement cost of the TIK and/or FTS
    from the appropriate agency or program.
    4.2. HQ USAF/TEP will notify SAF/IA (Weapons Division) if reprioritization or allocation from
    other programs will result in changes or delays to foreign test programs involving USAF munitions.

Aircraft Increment or Weapon Increment—An update to an existing weapon or aircraft, such as an
OFP change or pre-planned product improvement (P3I).
Objective Aircraft—All aircraft not designated as threshold by the appropriate CJCSI 3170 series
capability document on which a weapon will be tested.
Objective Weapon—All weapons not designated as threshold by the appropriate CJCSI 3170 series
capability document, which will be integrated onto an aircraft to form a weapon system and will be tested.
Program Manager (PM)—1. The designated individual with responsibility for and authority to
accomplish program objectives for development, production, and sustainment to meet the user’s
operational needs. The PM shall be accountable for credible cost, schedule, and performance reporting to
the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA). (DoDD 5000.1) 2. Applies collectively to system program
directors, product group managers, single managers, acquisition program managers, and weapon system
managers. Operating as the single manager, the PM has total life cycle system management authority.
NOTE: This AFI also uses the term “PM” for any designated person in charge of acquisition activities
prior to MS A (i.e., before a technology project is officially designated an acquisition program).
Threshold Aircraft—The aircraft, as defined in the CJCSI 3170 series requirements documents, that
defines the minimum for aircraft/weapon integration. This is (these are) usually the aircraft on which
testing and integration occur first.
Threshold Weapon—The weapon(s), as defined in the CJCSI 3170 series requirements documents, that
defines the minimum for aircraft/weapon integration. This is (these are) usually the weapon(s) on which
testing and integration occur first.
Using MAJCOM—The MAJCOM that generated and validated the requirement for the system or system
change; usually ACC. Example: For the JDAM the Using MAJCOM is ACC.
Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP)—Air to Air and Air to Ground programs established by
COMACC Plan 85 and COMACC Plan 90 respectively to evaluate assigned forces. The goal of WSEP is
to evaluate each weapon system within 12 months after fielding and continuing throughout its operational
life cycle, using line of the Air Force crews, aircraft, and weapons.

                  UNPLANNED TEST REQUIREMENT REQUEST FORMAT

A2.1. MAJCOMs will submit a request for TIK and FTS assets in conjunction with paragraph 4.1. using
the memorandum format below. Refer to AFI 21-201 for an explanation and details of the request process
and format for munitions.

A2.2. A report of current expenditures of TIK and FTS should accompany any unplanned test require-
ment in order for HAF/A5RW and HAF/TEP to make an informed decision. The report of current expen-
ditures should be via an existing report format. In addition to the expenditure report, HAF/A5R or HAF/
TEP may request an update to actual TIK and FTS expended to date (to get the most current data) via
other means (such as an Excel spread sheet, or even phone update).
