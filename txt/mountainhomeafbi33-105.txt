SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Personal Wireless Communications Systems (PWCS) (366 CS/SCOSR) was changed to Base
Radio (366 CS/SCOT). Added Community Center to paragraph 9., and Hangar 1331 to
paragraph 10..
1. Priority Mission Requirements. The Primary mission of 366 CS/SCOT is to provide
Communications-Electronics maintenance to emergency response, ground control, and command
and control communications systems. These systems carry a high priority and have a critical
impact on flight safety. All outages affecting, or potentially affecting, the flying and command
and control missions will have priority over PA support.

   3.9. Squadron Christmas/holiday party
4. Final Approval Authority. 366 CS/CC (Commander) is the final approval authority on all
PA requests.
5. Equipment:
   5.1. Official. 366 CS/SCOT will provide sound equipment necessary to support official PA
   requirements on MHAFB based on mission, manning, and equipment availability. This
   equipment is not available for loan. (Note: Podiums or any other furniture, laptops, video
   screens, or projectors are not provided by 366 CS/SCOT.) Laptops, projectors, and video
   screens can be scheduled through 366 FW/PA (Public Affairs) at 828-6800. 366 CS/SCOT
   can provide an audio feed for a slide show/laptop through the PA system; if notified at time
   of request. PA equipment for official functions is available up to 3 hours prior to the event
   for set up and practice, dependent upon mission, and manning. 366 CS/SCOT will provide
   only official military music for these functions. Official functions requiring music other than
   official military music will be provided by the host of the event.
   5.2. Unofficial Functions. For unofficial functions, a system consisting of two microphones
   (one wired and one wireless), one amplifier, two speakers, speaker cable, and CD/MP3
   player is available for loan, as well as megaphones. These items are available from 366
   CS/SCOT (Building 605). User is provided training on how to set up and operate the system
   once the items are picked up. The loaner system is available for sign-out the duty day prior
   to the event, and returned the duty day following the event. Users will not be in possession
   of the loaner system for more than 5 consecutive days. If a system is kept longer than 5
   consecutive days, 366 CS/SCOT will send a letter to the user’s squadron commander.
6. Procedures and Requests. Direct PA support requests to 366 CS/SCOT no less than 7 work
days prior to date of the event. This allows for sufficient time to schedule equipment and
manning. Organizations or committees with large or special events should submit requirements
as early as possible, to ensure special needs can be met. Short-notice requests (less than 7 work
days) are for events that get scheduled at the last minute (e.g., Air Combat Command (ACC)
commander’s call, unscheduled very important person (VIP) visits, emergency
squadron/group/wing commander’s calls etc.). Requests received less than 7 work days from the
day of the event are routed from 366 CS/SCOT to 366 CS/CC for approval. This does not
guarantee PA support will be provided. PA support is on a first-come, first-served basis, and can
be requested via e-mailing 366 Public Address Requests at 366 Public Address Requests.
Request for PA support via e-mail is confirmed by 366 CS/SCOT via phone and e-mail to the
requestor's point of contact no later than 5 work days after receiving the request. If confirmation
is not received within 5 days, it is the requestor’s responsibility to notify 366 CS/SCOT at 828-
3610.
7. The Gunfighters Club PA System. The Gunfighters Club has a permanent system installed
in the three main ballrooms. 366 CS/SCOT is not responsible for the operation or maintenance
of these systems. Use of this system should be coordinated through the Gunfighters Club
manager at 828-2395. However, 366 CS/SCOT will provide support for official functions when
determined necessary by 366 CS/SCO (Operations Flight Commander). 366 CS/SCOT will
provide a loaner system if needed for the Bernie Fisher and Doom rooms once a PA request is
submitted.
