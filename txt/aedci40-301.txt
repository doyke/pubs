NOTE: The ages specified are the minimum age and are based on the child’s ability to demonstrate behavior appropriate to the level of responsibility and safety required. Children who do not
consistently demonstrate appropriate responsible behavior should not be given the same degree of self-management responsibilities. In all instances below where a “yes” is indicated, the parent is
responsible for: (1) using reasonable judgment and (2) an incident or mishap (considered preventable) which occurs. Parents are responsible for the safety and well-being of their children and their
children’s behavior.
