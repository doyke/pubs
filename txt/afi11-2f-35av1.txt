     responsibility (OPR) on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication IAW
     AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP).
1.4. Training. Training programs are designed to progress pilots from Initial Qualification
Training (IQT) (B-Course or Transition/Requalification Training [TX]), then to Mission
Qualification Training (MQT), and finally to Continuation Training (CT).
     1.4.1. IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify pilots in a basic position and
     flying duties without regard to a unit's mission. Upon completion of IQT, the pilots attain
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               7


  BAQ status. BAQ is a prerequisite for MQT. Except for General Officers above wing level,
  BAQ is not a long term qualification status. Waiver authority for pilots, other than general
  officers above the wing level, to remain BAQ is MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G).
  1.4.2. MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify or requalify pilots in a
  specific position and flying duties to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. Pilots
  maintain BAQ status until they complete MQT. Completion of MQT or Formal Training
  Unit (FTU) instructor course is a prerequisite for BMC and CMR. Pilot will then be assigned
  to either a CMR or BMC training status.
  1.4.3. Continuation Training (CT). There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of pilot
  training in the basic flying skills. These skills ensure safe operation of the aircraft. The
  second consists of specific mission-related training required to accomplish the unit's assigned
  missions contained in the RAP Tasking Memo (RTM). The RTM takes precedence over this
  instruction and may contain updated requirements and events not yet incorporated in
  Attachment 2.
  1.4.4. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). The RAP program is designed to focus training on
  capabilities needed to accomplish a unit's core tasked missions. Following completion of IQT
  and MQT, pilots will have received training in all the basic missions of a specific unit unless
  excluded in Chapter 3.
     1.4.4.1. Mission Ready (MR). An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed
     mission qualification training and maintains qualification and proficiency in the
     command or unit operational mission.
     1.4.4.2. Combat Mission Ready (CMR). An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
     completed mission qualification training and maintains qualification and proficiency in
     the command or unit combat mission..
     1.4.4.3. All designated combat (CC-coded) unit active duty API-1 positions, flying
     Squadron Commander (SQ/CC) and Duty Officer (DO) positions are designated CMR
     positions. Operations Group Commanders (OG/CCs) may designate other API-6
     positions not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR. (Exception: If a unit is over-
     manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line of their Unit Manning Document
     (UMD) API-1s to CMR and designate the overage BMC. In this case, priority should be
     given to inexperienced pilots with at least 50 percent, if available, designated CMR).
     (ARC/TFI: Any pilot may be designated CMR at OG/CC discretion). CMR pilots
     maintain proficiency and qualification in all core missions of the flying unit to which they
     are assigned or attached. CMR pilots maintain currencies which affect CMR status,
     accomplish all core designated flight training (missions and events), and all mission
     ground training. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results in
     regression to non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by appropriate authority.
     1.4.4.4. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
     completed mission qualification training, is qualified in some aspect of the unit mission,
     but does not maintain MR/CMR status. The aircrew member must be able to attain full
     qualification to meet operational taskings within 30 days.
     1.4.4.5. All non-CMR active duty wing pilot positions are designated BMC positions.
     BMC designations are assigned to pilots who have a primary job performing wing
 8                                                     AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010


        supervision or staff functions that directly support the flying operation, or are FTU
        instructors, Weapons School (WS) instructors, pilots assigned to active flying billets in
        units without assigned aircraft (i.e. 549 CTS [Air Warrior I], etc.), or operational test
        pilots. For those missions in which they maintain familiarization only, BMC pilots must
        be able to attain proficiency and qualification in 30 days or less. BMC pilots accomplish
        all mission related ground training designated by their attached SQ/CC. BMC pilots may
        deploy and may participate in any mission for which they are proficient and qualified,
        without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC. Failure to complete BMC
        required training results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC) status. AFRC and AFRC
        TFI BMC training events will be directed by RAP Tasking Memo.
        1.4.4.6. BMC pilots assigned to units without assigned aircraft (i.e. 549 CTS [Air
        Warrior I], etc.) will fly a RAP mix as determined by the unit commander consistent with
        their unit’s tasking. RAP events and weapon requirements are determined by the unit
        commander.
        1.4.4.7. N-CMR/N-BMC. Pilots that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will accomplish
        the requirements in accordance with paragraph 4.10 While N-CMR/N-BMC, pilots may
        perform missions (including exercise and contingencies) in which they are current,
        qualified, and either familiar or proficient.
        1.4.4.8. Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skills
        necessary to carry out the unit's assigned missions that is not required by every pilot such
        as Flight Lead (FL) Upgrade (FLUG), Instructor Pilot (IP) Upgrade (IPUG), Forward Air
        Controller (Airborne) (FAC(A)), etc. See Chapter 6 for specialized training requirements.
        Specialized training is normally accomplished after a pilot is assigned CMR/BMC status,
        and is normally in addition to CMR/BMC requirements. Unless otherwise specified,
        pilots in CMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities/qualifications as long as
        any additional training requirements are accomplished.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
     1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
     consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
     realism against the expected threat, pilot capabilities, and safety. This instruction provides
     training guidelines and policies for use with operational procedures specified in applicable
     flying/operations publications.
     1.5.2. Units will emphasize RAP training missions on either basic combat skills or scenarios
     that reflect procedures and operations based on employment plans, location, current
     intelligence, and opposition capabilities. Tactical training will include use of inert and live
     ordnance, threat simulators, countermeasures, and dissimilar aircraft as much as possible
     1.5.3. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC TRSS) will assist OG/CCs in development of
     training programs when/where tasked by the HQ ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMs may submit
     requests for training program support to the HQ ACC/A3. If validated, these requests will be
     prioritized and tasked to ACC TRSS. CB-coded units may develop syllabi to upgrade
     operational test pilots in support of specific test plans. These syllabi will be approved by the
     OG/CC and submitted to ACC TRSS.
     1.5.4. In-flight Supervision:
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 9


      1.5.4.1. Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision
      necessary to accomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include
      introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an IP may be
      required.
      1.5.4.2. IPs and FL-qualified SQ supervisors may allow any pilot to lead portions of a
      mission if appropriately briefed. This provision will only be used to allow the pilot to
      practice events in which he is already qualified or to help determine if the pilot is ready
      for FLUG.
      1.5.4.3. Flight leads may give their wingman the tactical lead for specific tasks. As a
      tactical lead, the wingman makes tactical decisions for the flight, but the flight lead
      retains overall authority and responsibility.
   1.5.5. Experienced Pilot (EXP)
      1.5.5.1. An experienced pilot has one of the following:
          1.5.5.1.1. 500 hours Primary Aerospace Vehicle Inventory (PAI).
          1.5.5.1.2. 300 hours PAI with 1,000 hours (First Pilot (FP)/IP/Mission Pilot (MP)).
          1.5.5.1.3. 100 hours PAI and previously fighter EXPERIENCED.
      1.5.5.2. For pilots, fighter time is defined as FP/IP/MP hours logged in aircraft while
      assigned an Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) of 11FX. OA-10 is considered fighter
      time.
      1.5.5.3. (N/A AFRC) Hours logged in the mission rehearsal trainer (MRT)/full mission
      simulator (FMS) accomplishing RTM-approved missions will be counted as ―hours‖
      when determining experience level. RAP MRT/FMS mission hours will not exceed 20%
      of the total required to meet the experienced threshold (ex: 100 RAP MRT/FMS Mission
      hours out of 500 hours PAI). See the current RAP Tasking Memo for guidance on
      approved RAP MRT/FMS Missions and logging procedures.
1.6. RAP Policy and Management:
   1.6.1. MAJCOMS determine their RAP Training cycle. This volume, along with the RAP
   Tasking memo and MAJCOM supplements, will establish the RAP mission requirements for
   each assigned training status and experience level.
   1.6.2. MAJCOMS determine where variances from the RTM are authorized. However,
   SQ/CCs may still use variations in missions or events as a basis for regression.
   1.6.3. An effective RAP training mission requires accomplishing a tactical or building block
   profile. Each mission requires successfully completing a significant portion of the relevant
   events as determined by the SQ/CC, RTM, and Attachment 2.
      1.6.3.1. Only one RAP training mission may be logged per sortie (day or night) unless
      separated by Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR). Each mission on either side of the AAR must
      stand alone as an effective RAP training mission. A maximum of two RAP missions per
      sortie may be logged under this rule.
   1.6.4. In CC-coded units, the SQ/CC's first priority should be to train all designated pilots to
   CMR status. CMR status requires:
 10                                                  AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010


      1.6.4.1. A 1-month lookback at the CMR sortie rate.
      1.6.4.2. Qualification in all core missions and weapons events required at CMR.
      1.6.4.3. Confirmation that CMR pilots can complete the prorated number of sortie/event
      requirements remaining by the end of the training cycle.
      1.6.4.4. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification
      or certification.
   1.6.5. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
      1.6.5.1. A 1-month lookback at the CMR rate.
      1.6.5.2. Qualification in all core missions and weapons events required at CMR.
      1.6.5.3. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification
      or certification.
      1.6.5.4. Squadron CC certification.
   1.6.6. SQ/CCs will determine and assign pilots that will train for and maintain special
   capabilities or qualifications. Special capability/qualification mission and event requirements
   are normally accomplished in addition to baseline CMR/BMC requirements except for
   mission commander and flight lead training.
   1.6.7. End of Cycle training requirements are based on the pilot's experience level on the last
   day of the current training cycle.
   1.6.8. CC-coded units converting to another MDS may fly pilots in CMR positions at the
   BMC rate if CMR sortie rates cannot be supported. One month prior to the operationally
   ready date, CMR pilots should be flown at a CMR rate. Active duty wings converting to new
   MDS are authorized one SQ equivalent (7/6 for 24/18 or less PAI) of additional API-6s
   during the conversion period. However, total wing staff flying the new aircraft shall not
   exceed new authorized total.
1.7. Training Sortie Program Development:
   1.7.1. Experiencing/Collateral sortie requirements must be considered when developing unit
   flying hour programs.
      1.7.1.1. Experiencing sorties are additional training sorties necessary to achieve desired
      proficiency in optimum time. RAP missions may not provide sufficient hours to
      experience pilots to achieve overall unit experience levels.
      1.7.1.2. Collateral sorties are not directly related to combat employment training but are
      necessary in day to day unit operations. These include, but are not limited to, functional
      check flights, ferry flights, deployments, and air shows. For the training cycle, the
      MAJCOM allocates a block of sorties to the unit for these purposes.
   1.7.2. Attrition sorties are allocated to unit flying hour programs to compensate for non-
   effective training sorties. Non-effective sorties are logged when a training sortie is planned,
   but a major portion of valid training for that type of mission is not accomplished due to poor
   weather, In Flight Emergency (IFE), adversary fallout, etc. For CMR pilots, non-effective
   sorties will be logged (and not counted toward RAP totals) when Red Air allocations are
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  11


   exceeded during a training. In order to accurately allocate the number of attrition sorties, it is
   essential that non-effective sorties are logged appropriately.
1.8. Training Records and Reports.
   1.8.1. Units will maintain pilot records for individual training and evaluations IAW:
       1.8.1.1. AFI 11-202V1.
       1.8.1.2. AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
       1.8.1.3. AFI 11-401.
   1.8.2. Units will track the following information for all pilots (as applicable):
       1.8.2.1. F-35A specific ground training (not Ancillary Training).
       1.8.2.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual missions and events
       cumulatively for the training cycle.
       1.8.2.3. RAP requirements and accomplishment using 1-month and 3-month running
       totals for look-back. Note: Exempt for CB/TF units.
       1.8.2.4. Currencies.
       1.8.2.5. Weapons employment qualification requirements in sufficient detail to document
       all employment attempts and hit/miss percentages in a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS)
       database of choice.
       1.8.2.6. Document individual certifications on AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew
       Certifications.
1.9. Pilot Utilization Policy:
   1.9.1. The overall objective is that pilots perform flying-related duties. Supervisors may
   assign pilots to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer etc.), but must continually weigh the
   factors involved, such as level of pilot tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience.
   For inexperienced pilots in the first year of their initial operational F-35A assignment,
   supervisors will limit the non-flying duties to those related to combat activities.
   1.9.2. Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to CAF API-1 pilots are
   weapons and tactics officer, programmer, flight safety officer (FSO), Supervisor of Flying
   (SOF), mobility/contingency plans, training (except Aircrew Resource Management System
   (ARMS) documentation), squadron Standardization/Evaluation Liaison Officer (SELO),
   squadron aircrew flight equipment officer, electronic combat officer, and other duties directly
   related to flying operations. In some instances, such as squadron-assigned flying safety
   officers, API-1s may be attached to the wing. API-1s will not be attached to wing staffs or
   man wing staff positions unless total wing pilot API-1 manning is 100 percent or better. CCs
   will ensure wing staff pilots (API-6s) perform duties justified in MAJCOM manpower
   standards documents and authorized in UMDs. AFRC: OG/CC may designate API positions
   as required to meet unit requirement.
1.10. Sortie Allocation Guidance:
   1.10.1. Inexperienced API-1 pilots should receive sortie allocation priority over experienced
   pilots. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
 12                                                 AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010


      1.10.1.1. Operational Units. CMR API-1, MQT API-1, CMR API-6, MQT API-6,
      BMC (API- All).
      1.10.1.2. Combined Formal Training and Operational Units. Formal syllabus
      training, CMR/API-1, MQT API-1, CMR API-6, MQT API-6, BMC (API-All).
      1.10.1.3. FTU and United States Air Force Weapon School (USAFWS). Formal
      syllabus training, IPUG, Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing
      Instructor or Flight Examiner (FE) duties.
      1.10.1.4. Test and Test Evaluation Squadron (TES) Units. Requirements directed by
      MAJCOM, training required to prepare for assigned projects/tasking, BMC training
      requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions.
   1.10.2. Wing API-6 authorizations are IAW unit manning documents.
   1.10.3. For FTU-only wings, all API-6 pilots will maintain instructor status (optional for
   wing commander (WG/CC), OG/CC, functional check flight (FCF) pilots, and one other).
   These wings will fly API-1/6 pilots as required by Programmed Flying Training (PFT). For
   wings consisting of both FTU and operational units, at least one of the following pilots will
   maintain formal IP status: WG/CC, WG/Vice commander (CV), OG/CC, OG/Deputy
   commander (CD).
   1.10.4. API-8 rated personnel flying authorizations, MAJCOM/Inspector General (IG)
   inspectors in API-8 billets, and Test Unit pilots will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM
   guidance. MAJCOMS determine the training status and CT requirements for API-8 pilots.
   Test unit pilots will fly the BMC sortie rate as a minimum and should meet monthly BMC
   lookback. SQ/CCs will direct additional sorties if syllabus or test missions provide
   insufficient pilot proficiency training. Units should provide assigned API 6/8 flyers adequate
   resources to maintain minimum training requirements. However, API-6 flyer support will not
   come at the expense of the flying squadron's primary mission. API 6 flyers will accomplish
   basic skills events with allotted BMC sorties. API-8 IG flyers will strive to accomplish basic
   skills events with allotted BMC sorties. If attached units cannot meet attached flyer
   requirements, they must request relief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring
   flying hour adjustments for attached API-8 and applicable API-6 flyers must request program
   changes IAW MAJCOM directives.
1.11. Waiver Authority:
   1.11.1. With MAJCOM/A3 approval, waiver authority for all requirements of the RAP
   tasking memo is the OG/CC. Additional guidance may be provided in the memo. Unless
   specifically noted otherwise in the appropriate section, and also with MAJCOM/A3 approval,
   the OG/CC may adjust individual requirements in Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and Chapter 6, on a
   case-by-case basis, to accommodate variations in aircrew member experience and
   performance. For all other provisions of this volume, and IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 1, the
   waiver authority is MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G).
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                             13

                        INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT)

2.1. General. This chapter outlines IQT of pilots into the F-35A. IQT includes Basic (B-
Course) and Transition/Requalification/Senior Officer (TX-Course) training and will normally
be conducted during formal syllabus courses at a FTU whenever possible. Graduates of F-35A
FTU will be proficient in air-to-air (A/A) and air-to-ground (A/G) mission tasks as indicated by
the Training Task List/Course Training Standards (TTL/CTS) of the FTU syllabus. Students will
graduate current and qualified in Air Combat Tactics (ACBT), Low Altitude Step Down
Training (LASDT) CAT I (500’), sensor management, weapons employment qualification (AIM-
120, AIM-9, laser guided bombs (LGBs), inertial aided munitions (IAMs), and air-to-ground
(A/G) gun). All IQT students will be administered an instrument qualification evaluation and a
mission qualification evaluation in the aircraft at FTU prior to graduation. These evaluations
require the graduate to demonstrate basic instrument qualification proficiency and mission
competency in both air-to-air and air-to-ground mission employment.
2.2. In-unit Training. IQT may be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V1 and this chapter using the
appropriate formal school courseware. The following guidance applies to in-unit training.
   2.2.1. MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3T) is approval authority to conduct local IQT, and is
   waiver authority to change the formal requirements of locally conducted IQT (ANG:
   ACC/A3G). Info MAJCOM/A3T.
   2.2.2. MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/CG) is the approval authority for senior officer in-unit
   training.
   2.2.3. Requests to conduct local IQT will include the following:
       2.2.3.1. Justification for the local training in lieu of formal course training.
       2.2.3.2. Summary of individual's flying experience to include last centrifuge training
       date.
       2.2.3.3. Date training will begin and expected completion date.
       2.2.3.4. Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale.
   2.2.4. Successful completion of IQT requires the upgrading pilot to complete aircraft
   qualification and instrument qualification evaluations IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2F-
   35A, Volume 2, Aircrew Evaluation).
2.3. Prerequisites. Course prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus
and the USAF Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA).
2.4. Ground Training. When IQT is conducted in-unit, ground training may be tailored to the
individual's background and experience or peculiar local conditions. However, available and
current reference materials, such as RTM, AFTTP 3-3, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals--F-35A,
instructor guides, and audiovisual programs, should be used as supporting materials to the
maximum extent possible. Simulator missions will be accomplished in the best simulator
available.
2.5. Flying Training:
 14                                                  AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010


   2.5.1. Mission sequence and prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course
   syllabus.
   2.5.2. Training will be completed within the time specified by the syllabus, as approved.
   Failure to complete within the specified time limit requires notification through
   MAJCOM/A3T to MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G) with pilot's name, rank, reason for
   delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.
   2.5.3. Pilots in IQT will fly under IP supervision (chased) until completing the instrument
   qualification evaluation.
   2.5.4. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements for
   IQT. Additional training due to student non-progression is available within the constraints of
   the formal course syllabus and may be added at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
2.6. IQT for Senior Officers:
   2.6.1. All formal training courses for senior officers (colonel selectees and above) will be
   conducted at FTUs unless waived IAW paragraph 2.2
   2.6.2. Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus
   requirements unless waived IAW syllabus directives and paragraph 2.2
   2.6.3. If senior officers must be trained at the base to which they are assigned they will be in
   formal training status. Unit duties will be turned over to appropriate deputies or vice
   commanders until training is completed. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by
   MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/CG).
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                     15


                                             Chapter 3

                      MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. General. MQT is a unit developed training program that upgrades newly assigned B or TX
course graduates to BMC/CMR to accomplish the unit mission. The culmination of initial MQT
is CMR certification via successful completion of a tactical mission led by the SQ/CC or his
designated squadron IP/supervisor. The mission elements are at the discretion of the SQ/CC, but
as a minimum will include A/A and A/G elements unless either mission is excluded from that
unit’s DOC statement. Following successful completion of this mission, the SQ/CC will certify
the upgrading pilot as CMR in the pilot’s gradebook. For other newly assigned pilots MQT-
LAO, Simulator (SIM) MQT-1 local area orientation (LAO)/Instruments, and appropriate
theater-specific ground training events are the minimum requirements. Guidance in this chapter
is provided to assist SQ/CCs in executing an OG/CC approved MQT program. Units are
expected to further tailor their programs based on current qualification, experience, currency,
documented performance, and formal training. Applicable portions of MQT may be used to
create a requalification program for pilots who have regressed from BMC/CMR to specifically
address deficiencies which caused regression.
   3.1.1. MQT will be completed within 45 calendar days (ARC: 120 calendar days). Timing
   starts at the pilot's first duty day at the gaining operational unit. If a pilot elects to take leave
   prior to entering MQT, the timing will begin after the termination of the pilot's leave.
   Training is complete upon SQ/CC certification to CMR/BMC. Notify MAJCOM/A3T if
   delay beginning MQT due to security clearance exceeds 30 days. If training exceeds the
   specified limit, units will notify MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G).
   3.1.2. The following CMR/BMC training items are granted grace periods for completion
   after MQT: AAR and night training may be accomplished NLT 90 days (ARC: 180 days)
   from completion of MQT. Failure to comply will result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC
   until training is complete. AAR and night training accomplished in IQT may fulfill MQT
   requirements as determined by the SQ/CC. Night training events require demonstrated
   proficiency and currency in similar day events, unless accomplished with an IP (chased).
   3.1.3. Pilots in MQT will not fly in FLAG-level exercises or WS support sorties.
   3.1.4. Prior to BMC/CMR certification, if not accomplished during FTU training, pilots must
   complete initial Weapons Employment Qualification IAW Chapter 5 and RAP tasking
   memo.
   3.1.5. Initial MQT training is intended to be a maximum of 7 sorties in length (including the
   certification sortie). Simulator missions may be added for proficiency at the discretion of the
   SQ/ CC; however, if a pilot’s initial MQT training program will exceed 7 aircraft sorties
   MAJCOM/A3T will be informed and details provided on why the MQT program will extend
   beyond either 7 sorties, or 45 days.
   3.1.6. Newly assigned B course graduates entering the MQT Program will not be tasked with
   squadron additional duties of any type until certified as CMR by the SQ/CC.
3.2. Ground Training:
 16                                                 AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010


   3.2.1. Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to the mission as
   determined by the SQ/CC. Training accomplished during IQT may be credited towards this
   requirement.
   3.2.2. Pilots transferring from another MAJCOM require region-specific airspace procedures
   academics before flying.
   3.2.3. Initial Verification: (N/A CB/TF-coded units): Initial verification will be completed
   within 60 days (ARC: 120 days) after completing MQT. Each pilot (not required for BMC)
   will demonstrate to a formal board a satisfactory knowledge of the squadron’s assigned
   mission. Board composition will be established by the SQ/CC. Desired composition is
   SQ/CC or SQ/DO, weapons, electronic combat (EC), intelligence, and plans representatives.
3.3. Simulator Training:
   3.3.1. SIM MQT profiles should be accomplished in the best available simulator. SIM
   MQT-1 is a prerequisite for the first MQT flight. Locally directed simulator missions should
   concentrate on squadron tasking and unique capabilities.
   3.3.2. SIM MQT--Local Area Orientation/Instruments. Normal ground operations,
   standard departure(s), navigation, emergency airfield procedures and approaches, published
   penetration and approach to primary alternates and home base, emergency divert procedures,
   emergency procedures (EPs).
   3.3.3. SIM MQT-Day/Night Air-to-Air Procedures. Trail departure, intercepts, EC
   equipment operation, threat detection, defensive reactions, F-35A employment including
   flow priorities and signature management in the low risk environment, post beyond visual
   range (BVR) transition to high-risk within visual range (WVR) environment (day only) from
   a detached (mutual support by presence) formation, switchology, EPs,               sensor
   operation/employment, and weapons employment IAW squadron Unit Committed Munitions
   List (UCML).
   3.3.4. SIM MQT--Day/Night Air-to-ground Procedures. Heavyweight takeoff, weapons

                                           Chapter 4

                             CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT)

4.1. General. This chapter outlines ground and flying training requirements for CMR, BMC,
and BAQ pilots. Pilots must be qualified IAW AFI 11-401, AFI 11-2F-35A-V2, and AFI 11-202
V1/V2. Additionally, they must complete IQT to fly in BAQ status, MQT or FTU IP upgrade to
fly in BMC status, or MQT to fly in CMR status.
4.2. Ground Training. Ground training will be accomplished IAW the ground training table in
the RTM. Waiver authority for the ground training specified is IAW the reference directive.
Ground training accomplished during IQT/MQT may be credited toward CT requirements for the
training cycle in which it was accomplished. This list is intended to be a single source reference
for F-35 specific ground training only, which will be tracked in ARMS. This list does not include
non-F-35A specific ancillary training (e.g. SABC, information assurance (IA) training) which
should not be tracked ARMS. Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes
precedence.
   4.2.1. Simulator (SIM): The event requirements in the RTM depict the minimum EP and
   tactical (TAC) SIM training requirements to be accomplished in best available simulator.
   SQ/CC will determine the required supervision for CT SIM missions, based on SIM
   capabilities, and mission training objectives. Units will develop scenarios that cover both EP
   and TAC SIM missions based on expected employment tasking and general systems
   knowledge requirements. Emphasis should be placed on training not readily attainable during
   daily flying activities. Units will review scenarios each training cycle and update as required.
   Pilots may receive credit for training accomplished in special SIM devices or HHQ-directed
   simulator test support, etc., if approved by the SQ/CC.
       4.2.1.1. During EP SIM missions, training in the following areas will be accomplished
       each training cycle: unusual attitude recoveries, spatial disorientation, inadvertent
       weather entry, controlled flight departure recognition and recovery procedures, controlled
       and uncontrolled ejection parameters, aircraft subsystem failure checklist procedures,
       relevant critical action procedures, and precision instrument procedures. Note: Pilots may
       satisfy EP SIM requirements by accomplishing or administering INSTM/QUAL EP
       Evaluations (EPEs).
       4.2.1.2. During TAC SIM missions, training in the following areas will be accomplished
       each training cycle: Aerospace expeditionary forces (AEF) and DOC relevant simulated
       combat employment, threat recognition/reactions and counter tactics, aircraft subsystem
       failure checklist procedures, relevant critical action procedures. Note: Pilots may satisfy
       TAC SIM requirements by accomplishing or administering mission (MSN) EPEs.
   4.2.2. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).
       4.2.2.1. This training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal/emergency
       procedures and aircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. One
       pilot should present a situation and another discusses actions necessary to cope with the
       malfunction and carry it to a logical conclusion. All critical action procedures (CAP) and
       squadron special interest items will be accomplished during monthly SEPTs. Incorporate
       the following elements into squadron SEPT training programs:
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               21


         4.2.2.1.1. SQ/CC/DO involvement in the selection of a monthly SEPT topic.
         4.2.2.1.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using actual mishaps/incidents as baseline cases.
         4.2.2.1.3. Discuss at least one EP for each major subsystem (engine, electrical,
         hydraulic, fuel, flight control and auxiliary power as applicable) in each session. The
         EPs should also span all phases of flight.
         4.2.2.1.4. Accomplish two SEPTs each training cycle with an IP or SQ supervisor to
         include minimum fuel and emergency divert training.
     4.2.2.2. SEPT training will be accomplished each calendar month, and the currency will
     expire at the end of the following month. Pilots with an expired SEPT are grounded until
     subsequently completed.
     4.2.2.3. SEPTs should be accomplished in the best available simulator. If a simulator is
     not available, SEPTs should be accomplished one-on-one or in small flight-sized groups
     as long as all members participate fully and share equal time responding to emergency
     situations.
     4.2.2.4. Completion of a simulator EP profile satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement.
     For an IP/FE administering the SEPT/EP SIM, this will satisfy their SEPT requirement.
     4.2.2.5. Formal course student SEPTs may satisfy the monthly SEPT requirement for the
     IP whom administers this training.
  4.2.3. Weapons/Tactics Academic Training. Units will establish a weapons/tactics
  academic training program to satisfy MQT and CT requirements. Training is required in each
  training cycle. Audio-visual programs may be used in place of academic instruction. The
  program will require successful completion of an examination (85 percent minimum to pass).
  Use testing to validate qualification to the maximum extent possible throughout the training
  program.
     4.2.3.1. Academic instructors should be USAFWS graduates or have attended the
     applicable academic portion(s) of school, if possible.
     4.2.3.2. Instruction and tests should include (as applicable), but are not limited to:
         4.2.3.2.1. A/A and A/G weapons description, operation, parameters, fusing,
         limitations, preflight, tactics, normal and emergency procedures/techniques.
         4.2.3.2.2. ACBT. Principles of aerodynamics, maneuverability, AHC, formations,
         signature management, flow priorities, tactical intercept principles, visual merge
         mechanics and execution, alert procedures and scrambles, use of Ground controlled
         intercept (GCI)/Airborne warning control system (AWACS), and enemy capabilities.
         4.2.3.2.3. Electronic combat (EC) equipment, capabilities, operation, checks,
         procedures, infrared missile defense (IRMD)/radar missile defense (RMD),
         countermeasures, and hostile electronic warfare (EW) tactics.
         4.2.3.2.4. Specialized training to support specific weapons, tactics (to include threat
         visual identification (VID) tactics), mission capabilities, authentication, wartime rules
         of engagement (ROE), and safe passage.

          LASDT Ground Training.
   4.2.4. Verification:
       4.2.4.1. Continuation verification updates pilots on their squadron's wartime mission.
       Each pilot will participate in a squadron initial/CT verification as a briefer, board
       member, or seminar participant. Pilots who participate in a unit deployment to a tasked
       AOR may receive credit for continuation verification.
          4.2.4.1.1. In CC-coded units, BMC pilots should accomplish an initial verification
          and/or participate in a CT verification to facilitate future upgrade to CMR status, at
          the discretion of the SQ/CC.
4.3. Flying Training. All pilots will accomplish the mission and event requirements listed in
the most current RTM. Failure to accomplish these requirements may not affect BAQ, BMC, or

CONTROL (ASC)

Notes:
1. See Attachment 2 for demanding/non-demanding sortie definitions. In addition, BAQ pilots will
fly in a supervised status (with a FL-qualified SQ supervisor or IP) any time a non-demanding sortie is
required.
2. Recurrency supervision level is IP in chase, qualified and current in event.
3. Supervision will be FL-qualified SQ supervisor or instructor, qualified and current in the
event/capability.
4. For formal course IP’s (Weapons instructor course (WIC) and FTU), CT and exercise participation
require above currencies; formal syllabus training missions require 180 days currency.
5. Updated by an actual weapons release on a class A/B/C range.
6. Currency is required in the pilot’s low altitude category for operations below 1000 feet (Table 6.1.).
Loss of currency requires regression to the next higher altitude block. Operations in a lower block will
update the higher block categories. Re-currency requires satisfactory performance in the following
events: vertical awareness training, hard turns, tactical formation, and offensive/defensive
maneuvering.
7. If non-current in precision approaches, increase the pilot weather minimum by one category. To
regain currency, fly a precision approach. Any simulator may be used to update currency (but not to
regain currency) provided simulator training is accomplished with WX at/below pilot minimums.
Multiple simulator approaches are desired. FL-qualified Squadron Supervisor or IP may accomplish.
8. Element A/A currency. Currency is updated by accomplishing an A/A event with emphasis on blue
element employment contracts and deconfliction. Does not affect CMR. If non-current, must
accomplish a day event. Opposed A/G sorties that fit the definition in A2.1.24. may update this
currency, IP required.
9. For IPs, accomplishing or instructing the event will update currency. WIC student sorties count as
instructor sorties.
10. Must be current in distributed aperture system (DAS) Refresher Academics. Supervision will be an
DAS current, FL-qualified SQ supervisor or IP in the element.
11. Currency is required in DAS LOW to fly in the night low altitude environment (IAW AFI 11-214,
Air Operations Rules and Procedures). Loss of currency will require re-accomplishment of single ship
low altitude familiarization (IP/SQ supervisor chased) IAW para 6.7.6.8.
12. Supervision for flight or simulator will be a current and qualified FCF pilot.
13. FAC(A)s will perform two controls to update air strike control (ASC) currency, IAW the current
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 27


Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) FAC(A) memorandum of agreement (MOA). No more than two
controls may be counted per CAS target or 9-line briefing. FAC(A)s will satisfy ASC currency and
event requirements by training with actual fighters and TACPs to the maximum extent possible.
Failing to meet either proficiency or currency will result in FAC(A) pilots being non-qualified.
14. For units with an MRT/FMS, this currency may be updated in the simulator as part of a tactical/EP
sim profile.
15. For units with any type of simulator (MRT, FMS), this currency may be updated as part of a
tactical/EP SIM profile.
   4.6.2. Recurrency. Pilots require additional training if a currency requirement is not met.
      4.6.2.1. Pilots must accomplish overdue training requirements as specified by the SQ/CC
      before they are considered requalified to perform the task. Training annotated as affecting
      CMR status will require regression to N-CMR until the pilot accomplishes the training.
      Training identified as not affecting CMR status does not require regression from CMR;
      however, it may result in additional training and increased supervision until the training is
      completed. The duration of supervised status and of sortie lookback will determine the
      effect on CMR status.
      4.6.2.2. Unless otherwise specified, supervisory requirements pertaining to recurrency
      may be satisfied in the flight position that offers the best control of the mission, as
      determined by the SQ/CC.
   4.6.3. Landing Recurrency. Loss of landing currency requires the following action (timing
   starts from date of last landing):
      4.6.3.1. 31-90 Days (46-90 Days--Experienced). Regain landing currency.
      4.6.3.2. 91-135 Days. Same as 4.6.3.1, plus instructor supervised SIM (tactics, normal
      and emergency procedures for CMR pilots; normal, instrument, and emergency
      procedures for BAQ and BMC pilots).
      4.6.3.3. 136-210 Days (136-225 for experienced). Same as 4.6.3.2, plus closed and
      open book qualification examinations, EPE, and CAPs written examination.
      4.6.3.4. 211 (226 for experienced) or More Days. IQT, including a re-qualification
      evaluation.
   4.6.4. ACBT Recurrency. Pilots losing currency in ACBT must accomplish the following
   sorties:
      4.6.4.1. 61-90 Days (91-120 Experienced). BFM (offensive and/or defensive).
      4.6.4.2. 91-180 Days (121-180 Experienced). AHC (One Vertical Recovery, one event
      from the HARTS series IAW AFTTP 3-3) and BFM (offensive and/or defensive).
      4.6.4.3. Over 180 Days. Accomplish a SQ/CC tailored program IAW paragraph 3.4.5
   4.6.5. Loss of/Requalification to IP Status. IPs will be decertified for:
      4.6.5.1. Failure of a flight evaluation or a commander directed downgrade. To regain IP
      status, the IP must successfully complete a flight check IAW AFI 11-202V2.
 28                                                  AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010


      4.6.5.2. Failure of an INST/QUAL open book test. To regain IP status, the IP must
      successfully reaccomplish the written exam.
      4.6.5.3. Expiration of instructor currency. 91-180 days requires an instructor recurrency
      flight with an IP. Over 180 days requires a Stan/Eval flight evaluation IAW 11-2F-35A-
      V2. WIC student sorties count as instructor sorties for currency.
      4.6.5.4. Loss of CMR status due to loss of currency in an event/sortie and the SQ/CC
      deems decertification is required. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the
      instructor becomes noncurrent in events/sorties which do not require removal from CMR
      status, instructor status may be retained, but the IP will not instruct in that event/sortie
      until the required currency is regained.
   4.6.6. DAS Re-currency Mission. Pilots losing DAS/NVC currency must accomplish the
   following events prior to unrestricted night operations:
      4.6.6.1. 2-ship basic formation work / light drills and unit specific mission elements.
      4.6.6.2. Tactical turns and maneuvers.
      4.6.6.3. Minimum of one of the following night profiles/sorties:
          4.6.6.3.1. Intercept DAS-TI profile not to exceed 2v2, above 5,000 feet AGL or
          MSA whichever is higher, or
          4.6.6.3.2. BSA above 4,500 feet AGL or MSA whichever is higher, or
          4.6.6.3.3. Unopposed surface attack tactics (SAT)/SEAD above 4,500 feet AGL or
          MSA whichever is higher.
   4.6.7. ASC Currency. Air strike control events only apply to FAC(A) qualified pilots and
   are IAW JCAS FAC(A) MOA (dated 1 Dec 07). Track each ASC performed by type as
   applicable for JCAS FAC(A) MOA documentation requirements. This currency only updates
   when FAC(A) qualified pilots act as the FAC(A) element lead. FAC(A)s will satisfy their
   requirements with ground units or TACPs whenever possible.
   4.6.8. MAJCOM/air operations squadron (AOS) currency requirements. Units will comply
   with AFI 11-207, Combat Aircraft Delivery, for additional currencies required for the flight
   delivery of aircraft coordinated through any AOS.
4.7. Regression (N/A to CB/TF-coded units):
   4.7.1. CMR/BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. Only RAP training and
   Contingency Operations sorties may be used for lookback. If a pilot does not meet monthly
   lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CCs can either: Regress the pilot to
   N-CMR/N-BMC, as applicable; remove the pilot from a CMR/BMC manning position; or
   initiate action to remove the pilot from active flying status.
      4.7.1.1. Failure to meet 1-month RAP/Contingency Operations sortie lookback requires a
      review of the pilot's 3-month sortie history. If the 3-month lookback has been met, pilots
      may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain CMR/BMC. Failure to meet the 3-month lookback will
      result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC status as appropriate, or the pilot may be placed
      in probation status for one month at the squadron commander's discretion. If probation is
      chosen, the only way to remove a pilot from probation and preserve the current status is
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                29


       to reestablish a 1-month lookback at the end of the probation period. Probation should not
       be used to disguise extended shortfalls in sorties that would result in underperforming the
       training cycle totals. Probation should be used sparingly.
       4.7.1.2. CMR/BMC pilots regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC for lookback, must complete a
       SQ/CC approved re-certification program to return the pilot to CMR/BMC standards.
       Upon completion of the re-certification program, the CMR/BMC pilots must also meet 1-
       month lookback requirement prior to reclaiming CMR/BMC status. The sorties and
       events accomplished during the re-certification program may be credited towards their
       total/type sortie and event requirements for the training cycle as well as for their monthly
       sortie requirement.
       4.7.1.3. Lookback computations begin following completion of MQT. The pilot must
       maintain 1-month lookback until 3-month lookback is established. SQ/CCs may apply
       probation rules as described in paragraph 4.7.1.1 if a new CMR/BMC pilot fails to meet
       1-month lookback while establishing 3-month lookback. In addition, 1-month lookback
       will start the first full month of CMR/BMC status.
   4.7.2. Regression for Weapons Qualification. Failure to maintain RAP tasked weapons
   qualification at the end of the training cycle may require regression to N-CMR/N-BMC.
   Refer to section 5.3.3 for requalification.
   4.7.3. Regression for Evaluation. Pilots who fail an aircraft qualification, mission, or
   instrument evaluation will be handled IAW AFI 11-202V2. Pilots will regress to N-CMR, N-
   BMC, or N-BAQ as applicable. These pilots will remain N-CMR/N-BMC/N-BAQ until
   successfully completing required corrective action, a reevaluation, and are recertified by the
   SQ/CC.
4.8. End of Cycle Requirements. Pilots who fail to complete mission and/or event
requirements of this instruction at the end of the training cycle may require additional training
depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency. Refer to paragraph 4.9 to see if some of
these requirements can be prorated. In all cases, report training shortfalls IAW paragraph
1.2.5.10 Note: N/A for CB/TF coded units.
   4.8.1. Pilots failing to meet total training cycle RAP mission requirements may continue CT
   at CMR/BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is
   required.
   4.8.2. Pilots failing to meet RAP mission type requirements will result in one of the
   following:
       4.8.2.1. Regress to N-CMR/N-BMC if SQ/CC determines the mission type deficiency is
       significant. To regain CMR/BMC the pilot must complete all deficient sortie types. These
       sorties may count towards total requirements for the new training cycle.
       4.8.2.2. Continue at CMR/BMC if total RAP sorties and lookback are maintained and the
       sortie type deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC.
   4.8.3. Pilots failing to accomplish sorties required for Special Capabilities/Qualifications
   will lose their qualification. The SQ/CC will determine requalification requirements.
4.9. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC
may prorate all training requirements when DNIFs, emergency leaves, Consecutive Overseas
 30                                                  AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010


Tour (COT) leaves, non-flying temporary duty (TDY)/exercises combat/contingency
deployments, (ANG: and or mandatory training required by civilian employment), preclude
training for a portion of the training period. Use Table 4.2 to determine proration. Normal leave
will not be considered as non-availability. Extended bad weather, which precludes the unit from
flying for more than 15 consecutive days may be considered as non-availability. (ANG: End-of-
cycle proration is permitted for documented attrition (e.g. HHQ or weather cancels, MNDs,
ground or air aborts) in monthly increments when the total number of occurrences ranges from
one half to one times the individual’s normal monthly rate of flying). The following guidelines
apply:

Table 4.2. Proration Allowance.

CUMULATIVE DAYS OF                MONTHS OF PRORATION ALLOWED

Over 345                          12
   4.9.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-
   availability and not to mask maintenance, flying hour program (FHP) execution, training or
   planning deficiencies.
   4.9.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying in the training
   cycle. Use Table 4.2. to determine the number of months to be prorated based on the
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                            31


  cumulative number of calendar days the pilot was not available for flying during the training
  cycle.
  4.9.3. If IQT or MQT is reaccomplished a pilot's training cycle will start over at a prorated
  share following completion of IQT/MQT training.
  4.9.4. Example: Capt Jones was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and
  attended SOS in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. His
  SQ/CC authorized a total of two months proration from his training cycle (two months for
  the 73 cumulative days of non-availability for flying). (ANG: Maj Smith is an experienced
  CMR pilot with a normal monthly requirement of 6 sorties. He had eight attrition
  occurrences throughout the training cycle; therefore his SQ/CC can prorate one month of Maj
  Smith’s training requirements).
  4.9.5. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next
  lower whole number; however, no requirement may be prorated below one.
  4.9.6. Newly assigned/converted pilots and pilots achieving CMR/BMC after the 15th of the
  month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration
  purposes. A prorated share of RAP sorties must be completed in CT.
  4.9.7. Night and AAR requirements accomplished during MQT may be credited toward
  prorated CT requirements if accomplished during the cycle in which the pilot was declared
  CMR/BMC unless specified otherwise by MAJCOM.
  4.9.8. A pilot's last month on station prior to departing permanent change of station (PCS)
  may be prorated provided 1 month's proration is not exceeded. Individuals departing PCS
  may be considered CMR for reporting purposes until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or
  sign in at new duty station, whichever occurs first.
  4.9.9. CMR pilots who attend USAFWS in TDY-and-return status may be reported
  throughout the TDY as CMR. Upon return, those pilots will accomplish a prorated share of
  sortie/ event requirements (see Table 4.2).
  4.9.10. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative
  impact on a unit's CT program, as emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A
  potential lack of training opportunities while supporting contingency operations can place a
  burden on the unit, forcing it to accomplish the majority of its CT program in a reduced
  period of time or with reduced assets. The following proration procedures are intended to
  provide flexibility in accomplishing the unit's CT program.
     4.9.10.1. Missions flown during contingency operations will be logged as such. These
     missions do not count toward RAP requirements, but may be used for lookback purposes.
     Except AAR, RAP events may be used to update currencies but do not count toward
     training cycle requirements. Units will prorate RAP missions and events upon returning
     from contingency operations for the period of time each individual was deployed.
     Proration is also authorized for deployment preparation and reconstitution where home
     station flying is reduced by the MAJCOM. (ANG/AFRC: individuals deployed for more
     than a seven-day period may prorate a one-month portion of RAP missions and events.)
     4.9.10.2. As the training quality of missions flown at contingency locations may vary
     considerably, OG/CCs are authorized to allow sorties that provided valid training to be
 32                                                AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010


      logged as RAP sorties. Events accomplished on these sorties count toward RAP event
      requirements, and these sorties/events may not be prorated.
      4.9.10.3. Upon return from contingency operations, units will prorate the sorties for the
      entire deployment, subtracted by the number of valid OG/CC-authorized RAP missions.
      The result is the allowable sortie proration. SQ/CCs will prorate based on the events
      accomplished during valid RAP missions. In all cases, negative numbers equate to zero.
4.10. Regaining CMR/BMC Status:
   4.10.1. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end of cycle weapons
   qualifications and/or event requirements, requalification is IAW paragraph 5.3.3
   4.10.2. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.7.1, the
   following applies (timing starts from the date the pilot came off CMR/BMC status):
      4.10.2.1. Up to 90 Days. The pilot must complete SQ/CC directed re-certification
      program in accordance with paragraph 4.7.1.2 In addition, all RAP event currencies must
      be regained. The SQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to re-
      certification to CMR.
      4.10.2.2. 91-180 Days. Same as above, plus Stan/Eval generated open and closed book
      written examinations.
      4.10.2.3. 181 Days and Beyond: Reaccomplish MQT.
4.11. Example of the Lookback, Regression, Proration, and Requalification Process:
   4.11.1. Capt Smith is an experienced CMR pilot in ACC with a 1 and 3 month lookback
   requirement of 9 and 27 RAP missions respectively. On 3 Feb, he flew an ACBT sortie prior
   to departing for a non-flying TDY for two months. He reported back for flight duty on 6 Apr.
   What is his status throughout his TDY and on his return?
      4.11.1.1. The SQ/CC wanted to list Capt Smith as a countable CMR pilot for reporting
      purposes throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 Mar, his Flt/CC performed the mandatory
      1-month lookback (Feb) on Capt Smith. He only flew one RAP sortie, failing the 1-
      month lookback. The Flt/CC then performed a 3-month lookback (Dec, Jan, Feb). This
      showed that he flew only 24 sorties for this period. Had he flown three more sorties, his
      SQ/CC could continue Capt Smith at CMR. With 24 sorties, Capt Smith did not meet the
      3-month lookback for a CMR pilot. The SQ/CC could regress Capt Smith to N-CMR, but
      instead elected to put him on probation, still carrying him as CMR.
      4.11.1.2. The SQ/CC decided to carry Capt Smith on probation for one month. On 1 Apr,
      Capt Smith's 1 month lookback (Mar) was 0 sorties. The SQ/CC must now regress Capt
      Smith to N-CMR. When Capt Smith returns, the SQ/CC will have to place him in a re-
      certification program. Upon completing this program, Capt Smith will need to re-
      establish his 1-month lookback by 1 May. Failing to do so would force him to be reported
      N-CMR one more month until the next lookback process on 1 June.
      4.11.1.3. If he had returned on 22 Mar, and had last landed the jet 48 days ago, he could
      fly a non-demanding sortie to regain demanding sortie and landing currency. For CMR
      purposes, Capt Smith would need to complete 9 RAP missions to recapture his 1-month
      lookback and get off probation. Although Capt Smith was still CMR in Mar, the SQ/CC
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           33


      flew him with an IP on his first few sorties to regain his landing, AAR, low altitude
      training (LOWAT), and formation take-off (T/O) and landing currencies.
      4.11.1.4. At the end of the training cycle on 30 Jun, the SQ/CC prorated 2 months off of
      Capt Smith's total requirements. In spite of this proration, Capt Smith was deficient in
      one mission category. The SQ/CC could regress Capt Smith to N-CMR if deemed
      significant. After accomplishing the tailored recertification program (in this case, the
      deficient sorties), the SQ/CC would recertify Capt Smith to CMR. This training counts
      for the new training cycle.

4.12. Instrument Training.
   4.12.1. An instrument training program will be developed IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument
   Refresher Program (IRP) .
 34                                                 AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010


   4.12.2. Units which seldom encounter bad weather and/or night recoveries should exercise
   pilots and approach facilities by periodically simulating "weather day" recovery operations,
   as determined by the SQ/CC.
   4.12.3. Pilots transferring from another MAJCOM require the theater-specific portions of the
   instrument refresher course (IRC) before flying without a theater-experienced pilot in the
   formation. MQT academics and the MQT LAO mission may satisfy this requirement.
   4.12.4. RAP events may be accomplished on an instrument mission provided
   accomplishment does not interfere with the primary goal of instrument training. The
   transition from instruments to visual references should be practiced on all instrument
   approaches. An instrument sortie is a basic skills requirement and may be credited toward
   monthly RAP lookback only IAW the RTM.
4.13. G-Awareness Continuation Training. Units will develop a CT program that provides
feedback to pilots and imprints a proper L-1 Anti G Straining Maneuver (AGSM) so that it
becomes an integral part of pulling Gs.
   4.13.1. The basis of this program is to give each FL, SQ supervisor, flight surgeon and, if
   available, aerospace physiologist the skills needed to evaluate a flight member's portable
   memory device (PMD) to ensure a proper AGSM is being performed. This program also
   makes assessment of the AGSM a normal debrief item after every flight. The assessment
   should be done as a normal part of PMD assessment while reviewing other tactical portions
   of the mission.
   4.13.2. Use the following minimum guidance to implement the unit's program:
      4.13.2.1. AGSM technique and assessment will be incorporated into the squadron CT
      program. Emphasis will be placed on briefing, debriefing, and assessing the L-1 AGSM
      using the PMD in the debrief on a daily basis. FLs, IPs, SQ supervisors, and flight
      surgeons should become adept at assessing and teaching the correct AGSM. Academics
      will include a discussion of the limitations imposed on aircraft performance as a result of
      an ineffective AGSM.
      4.13.2.2. The G-awareness exercise will be flown IAW the guidance in AFI 11-2F-35A,
      Volume 3, Operations Procedures.
      4.13.2.3. FLs will assess the AGSM effectiveness of flight members during mission
      debriefings. This assessment should not be limited to the G-awareness exercise. Evaluate
      the AGSM after the pilot has had the time to fatigue to get an accurate assessment of a
      pilot's AGSM during a tactically and G-demanding portion of flight. AGSM should also
      be evaluated under relatively low intensity G such as A/G sorties.
      4.13.2.4. An A/A mission PMD for each pilot will be reviewed each training cycle by the
      squadron flight surgeon, aerospace physiologist, or a squadron supervisor. The reviews
      will be documented.
   4.13.3. FLs or SQ supervisors will identify pilots having poor AGSM technique or low G-
   tolerance to the Flt/CC or appropriate operations supervisor. The SQ/DO or appropriate
   operations supervisor will determine what action is required to improve the pilot's G-
   tolerance. The SQ/CC will determine if refresher training is required IAW AFI 11-404,
   Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew.
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                35


4.14. Low/Slow Speed Electronic Identification (EID)/VID Procedures:
   4.14.1. For units specifically tasked to perform the Homeland Security mission or counter
   drug role, comply with current approved guidance.
   4.14.2. For all other units, the objective of this low/slow EID/VID training is to expose pilots
   to problems associated with intercepting low/slow flying aircraft (rotary and fixed wing) for
   visual identification practice in a threat environment. Emphasis should be placed on
   dissimilar adversaries below 2000 feet AGL and 200 Knots indicated airspeed (KIAS)
   (helicopters are desired). Training will be conducted IAW AFTTP 3-1, Mission Employment
   Tactics , AFI 11-2F-35A-V3, and AFI 11-214.
      4.14.2.1. Unit developed ground training programs will be designed for unit specific
      equipage and employment taskings. Academic sessions should be conducted during
      weapons and tactics training and maximum use of the visual recognition program is
      encouraged.
      4.14.2.2. Flying training missions should, to the maximum extent possible, include
      USAF helicopters, United State Navy (USN) helicopters, United States Army (USA)
      helicopters, and propeller aircraft. Creation of a realistic environment to stimulate the
      aircraft EID/VID suite is essential to the conduct of low/slow VID procedures. Units
      must make every effort to maximize effective use of limited assets as well as to instill
      awareness and actions appropriate to this training. SQ/CC's will determine the depth of
      ground and flying training necessary prior to participating in exercises and contingency
      operations.

                                            Chapter 5

                      WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION

5.1. General. This chapter outlines requirements for attaining initial qualification and
maintaining CT qualification in the employment of A/G and A/A weapons. Refer to ―Glossary of
Missions/Sorties/Events‖ at Attachment 2 for further guidance on weapons qualifications.
5.2. Initial qualification (QUAL): Pilots must attain initial qualification in any weapon or
weapon category listed as QUAL in the RAP Tasking memo. Initial qualification can be attained
in IQT or MQT, and may be credited toward CT qualification requirements.
   5.2.1. Initial qualification and requalification in a weapon or weapon category is satisfied
   when the pilot has achieved a minimum of 3 hits out of 6 consecutive employment attempts.
   Initial qualification will carry over for consecutive F-35A assignments.
5.3. CT qualification (QUAL): Pilots must maintain qualification in any weapon or weapon
category listed as QUAL in the RAP Tasking memo. These criteria establish the minimum
standards for a pilot to maintain qualification and do not necessarily determine evaluation criteria
established by other instructions or agencies (e.g., inspection/evaluation teams).
   5.3.1. CT weapons employment will be from tactical deliveries or intercepts simulating
   realistic employment of UCML munitions, and IAW all appropriate guidance. To maintain a
   combat perspective during training, CT A/G weapons employment qualification requirements
   will be accomplished using full scale live/inert munitions and Standard Conventional Loads
   (SCLs) to the maximum extent possible. To achieve this, units should schedule full scale
   live/inert munitions such that every CMR pilot and the maximum number of aircraft have the
   opportunity to expend.
   5.3.2. QUAL for A/G weapons requires a hit rate of 50 percent when compared to total
   employment attempts. QUAL for A/A weapons requires a 75% hit rate (valid at
   pickle/trigger squeeze) when compared to total employment attempts. Hit criteria is IAW
   AFTTP 3-1 and/or this Volume, as applicable. The RAP Tasking memo further defines
   QUAL requirements based on the training cycle.
       5.3.2.1. PMD assessment. 100% of guided A/G and A/A weapons employment
       qualification requirements may be PMD assessed. Strafe events require actual weapons
       employment.
       5.3.2.2. At the end of the training cycle, each pilot’s weapons employment statistics
       (hit/miss percentages) will be reviewed to assess qualifications. Weapons employment
       qualifications are valid through the subsequent training cycle.
   5.3.3. Failure to Qualify: Failure to qualify in one weapon or weapon category does not
   invalidate qualification in others. SQ/CCs may declare a pilot unqualified in a weapon or
   weapon category at any time during a training cycle without affecting other weapon
   employment qualifications. If qualification is required at CMR/BMC, failure to qualify will
   result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC until requalification is accomplished IAW 5.2.1
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                37


5.4. Familiarization (FAM): Familiarization for weapons does not require a hit rate when
compared to total employment attempts. The RAP Tasking memo further defines FAM
requirements based on the training cycle.
5.5. Weapons Employment Parameters. The event requirements and parameters listed below
form the basic framework for pilot weapons employment training. All weapons employment will
conform to the limits established for each specific event. Pattern descriptions, procedures,
training rules, and foul criteria are contained in AFI 11-2F-35A-V3 and AFI 11-214. Events
performed at night may require higher minimum recovery altitudes based on AFI 11-214, Night
Training Rules.
   5.5.1. Strafe Events.
       5.5.1.1. Tactical Strafe (TAC STRF) is a combined event. Any combination of low
       angle strafe (LAS) and/or high angle strafe (HAS) hits satisfies this training requirement.
       Each pass is a standalone event for weapons employment qualification with no maximum
       number of passes. Hit criteria (regardless of aircraft rounds limiter setting): acoustically
       scored or independently observed impacts on a point target, or bullet dispersion within 36
       feet of any target. For PMD assessment: a stabilized pipper on target during witness cue.
       5.5.1.2. Low Angle Strafe (LAS). Planned dive angle 15 degrees or less. Minimum
       recovery altitude is 75 feet above ground level (AGL). Foul line is 2,000 feet.
       5.5.1.3. High Angle Strafe (HAS). Planned dive angle greater than 15 degrees.
       Minimum recovery altitude is 500 feet AGL.
   5.5.2. Guided Munitions Events:
       5.5.2.1. Laser Guided Bomb (LGB). An event in which a combat/training laser is
       employed to self-lase simulated/actual ordnance during an LGB delivery. Minimum
       recovery is safe escape/fuse arm/guide time required for the ordnance being
       simulated/delivered. Hit criteria: IAW AFTTP 3-1.
       5.5.2.2. Inertially Aided Munition (IAM). An event in which an aircraft system is used
       to determine release parameters for JDAM, JSOW or WCMD weapons. Simulated or
       actual delivery of ordnance is required. Minimum recovery is safe escape for the
       ordnance being simulated/delivered. Hit criteria: IAW AFTTP 3-1.
   5.5.3. A/A Weapons Events: AIM-9/AIM-120/A/A GUN. Hit criteria is IAW AFTTP 3-1
   shot criteria and/or this Volume as applicable. Reference paragraphs 5.3 and 5.4
5.6. Full Scale Inert/Live Ordnance. Full Scale Inert/Live ordnance training is essential to
pilot combat capability. Every attempt should be made to give pilots the opportunity to employ
as many types of weapons on the unit’s UCML as possible. To provide this opportunity, pilots
should expend the following ordnance:
   5.6.1. Two actual IAM per training cycle.
   5.6.2. Two actual LGB per training cycle.

                                          Chapter 6

                                 SPECIALIZED TRAINING

6.1. Specialized Training Programs. This chapter outlines upgrade training programs for
special capabilities and qualifications. These programs are intended to provide a basic starting
point and should be modified by the SQ/CC based on the unit's requirements and/or the
upgradee's previous experience, qualifications, and documented performance. Unless governed
by a formal syllabus, ground and device training for these programs will consist of unit-
developed academics and scenarios. Flight training will be conducted in accordance with a
program approved by the SQ/CC.
6.2. Flight Lead (FL) Upgrade. This program establishes the minimum guidelines for those
pilots identified by the SQ/CC to upgrade to flight lead. This program takes an F-35A pilot with
demonstrated tactical proficiency as a wingman and teaches flight leadership and decision-
making.
   6.2.1. Initial entry may be as a 2-ship/element FL until experience and proficiency warrant
   further progression, in which case, responsibilities for employment will not exceed two
   aircraft until certified as a 4-ship FL. The SQ/CC will determine when a 2-ship FL may train
   toward larger, more complex formations (three- or four-ship).
   6.2.2. The following minimum flying hours are required prior to entering FL upgrade
   training:
       6.2.2.1. 300 hours PAI, or
       6.2.2.2. 200 hours PAI with 400 hours IP/FP/MP in a 11Fxx, 11K3C, or 11K3D AFSC,
       or
       6.2.2.3. 50 hours PAI, if previously qualified as a 11Fxx AFSC flight lead.
       6.2.2.4. (ANG, AFRC, initial Air Education and Training Command
       (AETC) Cadre) For converting units, OG/CCs may select prior flight lead qualified
       pilots to upgrade to flight lead concurrently with the MQT top off program regardless of
       PAI hours.
   6.2.3. Ground Training. Ground training will consist of locally developed instruction in
   the following areas. Add unit specific ground training items for unique ordnance, pods, or
   capabilities.
       6.2.3.1. FL Responsibilities. FL/wingman relationship, airmanship, judgment and
       maturity should be addressed as they relate to flying and squadron related duties.
       6.2.3.2. Mission Preparation. Mission objectives, wingman requirements and
       responsibilities, currencies, capabilities, delegation of mission planning duties, and
       briefing preparation.
       6.2.3.3. Conduct of Flight Briefings and Debriefings. Objectives, use of briefing
       guides and audiovisual aids, flight member involvement, briefing techniques,
       debriefing/questioning techniques, PMD review responsibilities and procedures.
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                39


     6.2.3.4. Conduct of Missions. Control of flight, flight discipline, emergency
     procedures, training rules, and responsibilities to SQ/CC.
     6.2.3.5. AGSM Techniques. Briefing, debriefing, and PMD assessment. Review the
     video, Anti-G Strain Technique Reinforcement and Assessment.
     6.2.3.6. IFEs and Emergency Diverts. Divert decisions as an element, support of
     wingman during EPs, FL responsibility and authority, min fuel planning, and Air Traffic
     Control (ATC) assistance.
     6.2.3.7. Simulator Training. To the maximum extent possible, high-fidelity simulator
     training should be incorporated into FL upgrade. SIM missions should precede flight
     training whenever possible and reinforce common errors allowing upgrade pilots to
     repeatedly practice upgrade tasks. Emergency procedures, lost wingman, and instrument
     training should be demonstrated in the SIM.
  6.2.4. Flight Training. Flight training will be conducted in accordance with an upgrade
  program approved by the SQ/CC. Missions may be flown in any order. The program outlined
  below provides a basic starting point and may be modified by squadron commanders based
  on unit needs and/or upgradee's previous experience, qualifications, and documented
  performance. All FLUG training will be under the supervision of an IP or flight lead-
  qualified squadron supervisor flying as the upgrading student’s wingman. Dissimilar
  adversaries should be used to the maximum extent practical during FLUG training. Units will
  add considerations/techniques for specialized capability (Electro optical targeting system
  (EOTS), DAS, etc) to applicable areas.
     6.2.4.1. FLUG Event Requirements. Two formation takeoffs and landings, a day or
     night aerial refueling, trail departure, and a trail recovery will be accomplished as a flight
     lead during the program.
     6.2.4.2. Night Employment. Employment with DAS is integral to night missions in
     every upgrade program. Include some non-DAS events in FLUG training. All A/G
     missions may be completed in the day or night to include certification.

6.9. Low Altitude Step-Down Training (LASDT). This training is normally conducted as part
of IQT. It may be used to requalify pilots who are significantly out of currency or to train pilots
to a lower category.
      6.9.1. To conduct low altitude operations safely, pilots need to be knowledgeable of aircraft
      handling and performance characteristics, tactical formation, intercept, offensive
      maneuvering, defensive reactions, and navigation. LASDT qualifies pilots to conduct
      LOWAT at or below 1,000 feet AGL. LOWAT block/category certification is required prior
      to performing unsupervised operations in that block/category.
      6.9.2. To provide a structured approach, the step-down training program is built on a multi-
      phase training process IAW Table 6.1 There is no time limit to progress beyond Category I
      and progress will be based upon individual pilot proficiency and training availability. All
      LASDT missions will be supervised by an IP or FL-qualified SQ supervisor who has
      completed LASDT training and is current in the LOWAT category being instructed.

Table 6.1. LOWAT Categories.

Category                    Altitude Block                    Upgrade Sorties To Certify

I                           1,000-500                         LASDT-1, LASDT-2,

II                          Below 500-300                     LASDT-3

III                         Below 300-100                     LASDT-4
      6.9.3. Category I qualification is a minimum requirement for CMR status. Units may accept
      a transfer pilot’s LOWAT qualification from other units. Category II training may not be
      conducted during MQT.
      6.9.4. Entry into LASDT (other than at FTU) requires SQ/CC approval. The altitude to
      which a pilot is certified is determined by the SQ/CC and based on the lowest altitude at
      which all tasks can be comfortably performed and proficiency demonstrated. The goal is
      proficiency down to the minimum altitude compatible with squadron mission. Upon
      successful completion of LASDT training, the SQ/CC will certify the pilot to the minimum
      approved altitude of the LASDT category. Squadrons may accept documented LASDT
      certification for pilots coming from other units/commands. With SQ/CC approval, low
      altitude training conducted at a formal course may be used to fulfill applicable requirements
      of this paragraph.
      6.9.5. LASDT will be scheduled and briefed as a primary portion of the mission. Compatible
      RAP CT events may be accomplished in conjunction with LASDT as long as the objectives
      of the LASDT sortie are met. LASDT will not be flown as an alternate mission.
      6.9.6. Ground Training. Coverage should support the mission and concept of operations of
      the squadron, incorporating appropriate portions of AFTTP 3-1 and AFTTP 3-3. All
      academic training will be completed prior to flight training/briefing.
         6.9.6.1. AHC. LASDT AHC will be IAW AFTTP 3-3, LOWAT exercises. Discuss
         aircraft performance as it applies to the low altitude environment, to include: control

6.10. Nuclear Certification. Establish a nuclear certification program for tasked units to
accomplish the requirements necessary to provide and maintain a nuclear capability IAW
published policy guidance and applicable Air Force instructions.
6.11. F-35A Block Differences Training. To train between all variants of the F-35A, pilots
must be current and qualified prior to beginning training.
   6.11.1. Academics. Academic instruction should be tailored to the pilot’s previous
   experience and should concentrate on the differences between the F-35A blocks. Instruction
   should address avionics system, electrical systems, engine differences (as applicable), EPs,
   sensors modes (as applicable). If available, an AETC formal course meets the requirements
   for academics and device training.
   6.11.2. Device Training. Pilots should receive simulator training as required by previous
   experience. This simulator should include systems EPs, practice instrument procedures,
   review of radar and intercept procedures, review of air-to-ground systems, and CAPs. Pilots
   assigned/attached to units without concurrent simulators will substitute two SEPTs for the
   simulator.
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  57


   6.11.3. Flying Training. Block differences training may be conducted during MQT. Pilots
   who do not require MQT should receive one supervised aircraft sortie. Flight briefing should
   stress cockpit procedures and employment techniques.
6.12. Contingency/Exercise Spin-Up Training This training will be conducted prior to
support of contingency operations (if time permits) or exercises. The objective of this
training is to ensure the pilot’s ability to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. For
contingency operations, units are responsible for contacting appropriate gaining
command/operations to determine expected mission taskings. For exercises, units are responsible
for referring to appropriate exercise plans (EXPLANS) and contacting appropriate exercise
POCs prior to deployment to determine expected mission taskings. These EXPLANS include
COMACC EXPLANS 80 for RED, MAPLE, and Coalition Flags, EXPLANS 323 for Air
Warrior 1, and EXPLANS 163 for Air Warrior 2. This assures the units are prepared for the
appropriate tasking and allows the responding OG/CC to tailor this training for the theater,
threat, and tactics for the assigned task. The SQ/CC is then responsible for implementation of
this spin-up, prosecuting the required missions, and determining the specific requirements
necessary to reach the desired level of proficiency. Emphasis will be placed on training needed
for missions not accomplished in daily operations. This training will be conducted IAW all
applicable instructions.
   6.12.1. If a pilot is not assigned to the tasked squadron, they must receive spin-up training as
   determined by the tasked SQ/CC. This applies to all attached pilots (OG/WG/HQ staffs, etc.),
   and all pilots augmenting from other squadrons (operational, FTU, WS, test, etc.). The
   objective of this training is to ensure attached/augmenting pilot is proficient to conduct all
   missions in support of expected tasking. The deploying SQ/CC will determine the amount of
   spin-up training required for each attached/augmenting pilot based on the pilot’s level of
   proficiency, currency, qualification, experience, etc. For augmenting pilots, once the amount
   of spin-up training is determined, the augmentee’s SQ/CC is responsible for ensuring the
   spin-up training is accomplished.
   6.12.2. Ground Training. All applicable pilots will complete ground training as necessary
   prior to their support of contingency operations or exercises.
       6.12.2.1. Academics. Units will brief exercise SPINS, ROE/TR, command and control
       (C2), engagement authority and procedures, and VID. MAJCOM/IN will assist the unit’s
       intelligence functions in the development of threat assessments and visual recognition
       training materials.
       6.12.2.2. Visual Recognition. Pilots must be able to visually identify aircraft (rotary
       and fixed-wing, including joint/allied assets) they are likely to encounter by name or
       numerical designator and determine whether the aircraft is a threat or non-threat (training
       should incorporate all aspects/angles, theater-specific paint schemes/fin flashes, and
       various configurations), identify ground equipment, and determine major categories of
       naval vessels.
   6.12.3. Flying Training. Tailor spin-up training to ensure all supporting pilots are
   proficient, current, and qualified in all expected mission taskings.
6.13. Forms Adopted. AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, AF Form
8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.

Terms
Air Combat Training (ACBT)—A general term which may include (D)BFM, (D)ACM, and
(D)ACT. Accomplishment of this event requires visual maneuvering against an airborne
adversary. Limited/Unlimited TRs (IAW 11-214) are not a litmus test for the accomplishment of
ACBT. The prefix (D) refers to dissimilar assets. When the prefix is missing, similar is assumed
as flown/required. When present in parenthesis, dissimilar is optional. When present without
parenthesis, dissimilar is assumed flown or required. This convention corresponds to all facets of
ACBT (i.e., BFM, ACM, ACT).
Air Combat Tactics (ACT)—Training in the application of offensive and defensive
maneuvering to achieve a tactical air-to-air objective. Defensive Counter Air (DCA), Offensive
Counter Air (OCA), Force Protection (FP) and other A/A centric missions that include
element/multi-ship blue tactics are examples of ACT. Limited/Unlimited TRs (IAW 11-214) are
not a litmus test for the accomplishment of ACT.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—The status of a pilot who has satisfactorily completed training
(MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions but does
not maintain CMR status. Pilot accomplishes training required to remain familiarized in all, and
may be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions of their weapon system and
unit. These pilots may also maintain special capabilities (refer to paragraph 4.3).
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)—A status of a pilot who has satisfactorily completed
training prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to fly the unit aircraft. The member must
perform at the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie and flight standards
set for the weapons system. Pilots are considered as BAQ until completion of MQT and
assignment to BMC/CMR. BAQ is not a permanent qualification except for General Officers
 68                                                   AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010


(GO) above the wing level, and any other crew members specifically authorized by
MAJCOM/A3. Pilots are authorized to perform certified missions/events without instructor pilot
or SQ supervisor supervision. Flight duties will be limited to those identified in paragraph 4.3
Certification—The process of certifying pilot tactical employment and special weapons
capabilities, procedures, and rules. Replaces verification for nuclear tasked units.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—A status of a pilot who has satisfactorily completed training
(MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit combat missions, and maintains
qualification and proficiency in these missions. In CC-coded units, all active duty API-1/2’s,
Squadron Commander, Operations Officers, and OG/CC designated API-6 manning positions are
required to maintain this qualification level. Exception: If a unit is over-manned, they may elect
to train the front line of their UMD to CMR with the overage designated as BMC.
Approximately 50% of the pilots selected for CMR must be inexperienced (refer to paragraph
4.3).
Continuation Training (CT)—Training to maintain proficiency and improve pilot capabilities
to perform unit missions (does not include formal syllabus or test plan missions). Applicable to
all pilots.
Currency—The minimum frequency required to perform a mission, sortie, or an event safely.
Delivery Parameters—Data reflecting current delivery considerations for general purpose
ordnance as well as tactical survivability. Appropriate aircraft/ weapons Technical Orders (T.O.)
must be consulted for live ordnance safe escape criteria and -1 performance charts for recovery
altitudes.
Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE)—An evaluation of pilot knowledge and
responsiveness to critical and non-critical EPs conducted by an FE in an MRT, FMS, or aircraft
cockpit.
Experienced Aircrew (EXP)—See paragraph 1.5.5
Flight Lead (FL)—As designated on flight orders, the individual responsible for overall conduct
of mission from preflight preparation/briefing to postflight debriefing, regardless of actual
position within the formation. A certified 4-ship FL may lead formations and missions in excess
of four aircraft, unless restricted by the unit CC. A 2-ship FL is authorized to lead an element in
a larger formation.
Full Scale Weapons Delivery (FSWD)—Delivery of live or inert ordnance representing a
typical combat configuration/SCL of guided munitions in a tactical scenario.
Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD)—An advanced visor and helmet system that can display
Heads-Up Display information on the inside of the pilot’s visor.

            GLOSSARY OF MISSION/SORTIE AND EVENT DEFINITIONS

A2.1. Mission/Sortie/Event Definitions:
   A2.1.1. 4-Ship Flight Lead (4FL) Mission. Special capability mission. Mission where FL
   led a flight of four or more. May be logged in conjunction with baseline training
   requirements.
   A2.1.2. 4-Ship A/A Employment Event. Offensive or defensive A/A employment as a 4-
   ship minimum against at least one red air. May include (but is not limited to): opposed 4-ship
   SAT, DCA (4vX), OCA-A(4vX), Force Protection, etc.
   A2.1.3. ACMI Event. An event which utilizes an ACMI range/facilities for flight and
   debrief (to include ACTS, RFMDS, Personal computer debriefing system (PCDS) and
   P4/5RC, etc.). Only one event may be logged per mission.
   A2.1.4. ACM Mission. ACM training is designed to prioritize flow priorities and signature
   management to achieve proficiency in element and single-ship maneuvering and the
   coordinated application of BFM to achieve a simulated kill or effectively defend against one
   or more aircraft from a pre-planned starting position.
   A2.1.5. Air Strike Control (ASC) Event. A control performed by the FAC(A) element
   lead, passing attack (9-line) information and performing Type 1, 2, or 3 control duties. Two
   controls are required to update an ASC event. The controls do not have to occur on the same
   mission. A control consists of at least one aircraft attacking a surface target. The control
   begins with a CAS briefing from a FAC(A) and ends with either an actual/simulated weapons
   release or an abort on a final attack run. No more than two controls can be counted per CAS
   briefing per target. Air strike control (ASC) events only apply to FAC(A) qualified pilots and
   are IAW JCAS FAC(A) MOA (dated 24 Mar 05). Track each ASC performed by type as
   applicable (see definition below) for JCAS FAC(A) MOA documentation requirements. Only
   applies to FAC(A) qualified pilots when performed as the FAC(A) element lead. FAC(A)s
   will satisfy their requirements with ground units or TACPs whenever possible.
   A2.1.6. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC) Mission (ANG: Event). Basic skills
   mission. Training for proficiency in utilization and exploitation of the aircraft flight
   envelope, consistent with operational and safety constraints, including, but not limited to
   high/maximum AOA maneuvering, energy management, minimum time turns,
   maximum/optimum acceleration and deceleration techniques, and confidence maneuvers.
   Instrument/AHC missions may be applied to monthly lookback at a maximum of one of
   either per month (3 for 3 month lookback) (ANG: N/A).
   A2.1.7. Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) Event. An AAR event requires tanker rendezvous,
   hook-up and transfer of fuel or 2 minutes of dry contact. More than one event may be
   credited if receivers accomplish another rendezvous, hook-up and fuel transfer/dry hook-up.
   A2.1.8. Alert Scramble Event. From an alert posture, launch on a scramble order in any
   tasked role. Simulated event may terminate after initial taxi. Only one event may be logged
   per sortie.

  A2.1.9. Attrition Sortie. Programming tool used to forecast future flight hour and sortie
  requirements. Attrition sorties are derived from historical data (weather, sympathetic,
  maintenance, etc.) and used to account for sorties cancelled before flight. Launched sorties
  cannot be considered attrition (see Non-effective Sortie definition).
  A2.1.10. BFM Mission. Building block mission. BFM (1 v 1) Training designed to apply
  aircraft handling skills to gain proficiency in recognizing and solving range, closure, aspect,
  angle off, and turning room problems in relation to another aircraft to either attain a position
  from which weapons may be launched, or defeat weapons employed by an adversary.
  A2.1.11. CAS Mission. Mission flown in support of ground forces (actual or simulated)
  under the control of a FAC or JTAC providing air strike control for the fighter attacks.
  Mission elements include: Intel scenario and tactical mission planning, execution against
  actual or simulated threats, simulated or actual weapons employment against designated
  targets while under positive control of a FAC(A) or JTAC interfacing (actual or simulated)
  with the TACS/AAGS C2 network, and INFLTREP. Excess night missions may be applied
  to day requirements. All night missions should include the use of DAS. All DAS aided
  missions should include covert/lights out training.
  A2.1.12. Collateral Sortie. Sortie not directly related to combat employment or basic skills
  training but necessary for accomplishment of unit training programs, such as ferry flights,
  deployments, hurrevac, airshows, etc. MAJCOMs will normally assign collateral sorties in
  lump sum (nominally 200 per fighter unit) adjusted for local conditions and circumstances
  (see paragraph 1.7.2). Tactical events accomplished on collateral sorties may be logged and
  used to update currencies but may not be logged as RAP missions or count towards RAP
  lookback requirements.
  A2.1.13. Commander Option/AEF Prep Mission. Mission allocated at the beginning of
  each training cycle by the unit commander based on DOC requirements or AEF
  commitments. Allocate for CMR pilots to meet individual training requirements and unit
  training objectives. Allocate for BMC pilots to meet the BMC definition and support
  squadron training requirements. CMR pilots may log any type RAP mission, with the
  exception of a Red Air, Instruments, or AHC.
  A2.1.14. Composite Force Training (CFTR) Event. Scenarios employing multiple flights
  of aircraft, each under the direction of its own flight leader, acting in a large-force
  employment (LFE) scenario to achieve a common tactical objective. Scenarios should be
  opposed by air and surface threats and should include at least 8 blue aircraft. Only one event
  may be logged per mission.
  A2.1.15. Contingency Sortie. A sortie tasked and flown while deployed for a contingency
  operation. These sorties are logged as Contingency Operations Sortie (SC13) in ARMS.
  These sorties and events accomplished on these sorties do not count towards training cycle
  RAP requirements, however, the sorties may be used for lookback and the events may be
  used to update currencies.
  A2.1.16. DAS LOW ALT Event. (ANG: N/A)- Event is defined as performing realistic,
  mission oriented low altitude DAS operations below the MSA during high-illumination.
  Events include low altitude navigation, tactical formation, defensive maneuvering to avoid or
  negate threats, and Air-to-Ground attacks.
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              73


  A2.1.17. Defensive Counter Air (Night) [(N)DCA] Mission. Mission designed to develop
  proficiency in DCA mission tactics. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and mission
  planning, execution of tactics to detect, engage, and negate aircraft employing adversary
  tactics and weapons capabilities to penetrate protected airspace or attack a specific target
  area, and in-flight report. Emphasis on signature management and flow priorities. Additional
  night missions may be applied to day mission requirements. All night missions should
  include the use of DAS. All DAS aided missions should include covert/lights out training.
  A2.1.18. Demanding Sortie. Sorties that task the pilot to the extent that flying frequency
  and continuity are most critical. Authorized missions/events requiring demanding sortie
  currency are: BFM, ACM, ACT, LOW A-A or A-G (below 1,000 feet AGL), CAS, Opposed
  SAT, CFTR, night missions, instructor duties, aerial demonstrations, etc. SQ/CCs may add
  missions/events to the demanding sortie list, depending on unit tasking and the individual’s
  capabilities. Also see Non-demanding Sortie.
  A2.1.19. Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) Mission. Mission designed to
  develop proficiency in DEAD tactics. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and integrated
  mission planning to support force package objectives, execution of tactics to detect and
  destroy (utilizing conventional, IAM, or LGB munitions) enemy IADS, to include SAM,
  AAA systems, and critical IADS nodes, employing adversary tactics and weapons
  capabilities to disrupt force package employment/destroy package assets, and in-flight report.
  Destructive suppression effects are cumulative, resulting in reduced attrition of friendly
  aircraft. Destructive operations should be integrated and used with disruptive operations.
  A2.1.20. Dynamic       Targeting      (DT)     A/A     Event. Complete        an     air-to-air
  intercept/engagement against a target relayed/passed by an appropriate command and control
  (C2) asset. Track information should be a datalinked (J 3.2 track) if possible, otherwise via
  normal radio communications (C2 asset and relay/passing of track information can be
  simulated). Only two events may be logged per mission.
  A2.1.21. DT A/G Event. Complete an air-to-ground attack/engagement against a
  target/(TST relayed/passed by an appropriate C2 asset. Track information should be a
  datalinked (J 3.5 track) if possible, otherwise via normal radio communications (C2 asset and
  relay/passing of track information can be simulated). Targeting within a CAS scenario does
  not meet the intent of this event. Only two events may be logged per mission.
  A2.1.22. Electronic Attack (EA) A/A Event. An intercept performed against a target using
  active and/or passive electronic protection (EP) against attacker’s radar, causing the attacker
  to employ EA techniques or tactics. Does not include co-channel interference. Only one
  event may be logged per engagement.
  A2.1.23. Element A/A Maneuvers Event. Formerly ACT (2v2) min. Accomplishing an
  A/A tactical event as Blue Air that requires element deconfliction, contract adherence, and
  formation maneuvering with emphasis on signature management. This may include (but is
  not limited to): ACM (as blue), element drag-press-attack, WEZ in depth maneuvers to VID,
  Skate/Banzai tactical execution, etc. Minimum of 2 in the blue element opposed by multiple
  groups or single multi-ship group.
  A2.1.24. EP A/A Event. The pilot detects an airborne threat via electronic means and reacts
  with appropriate maneuvers, electronic countermeasures (ECM) switchology, and/or
74                                                 AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010


  expendables. Airborne threat training will be accomplished only with a dedicated adversary
  attacking from BVR. Only one event may be logged per engagement.
  A2.1.25. EW Range Event. Inflight operations conducted on an EW range with fixed or
  mobile surface-to-air emitters operating and detection/threat reaction emphasized. Normally
  accomplished in conjunction with other EW-type events. The pilot detects a surface threat via
  electronic means and reacts with appropriate maneuvers, pod/internal EP switchology and/or
  expendables. Missions flown against EW Aggressor or mobile threat emitters placed in a
  MOA, range, or along a low level route are acceptable. Only one EW range event may be
  logged per mission (Active EA must be used).
  A2.1.26. Flag Exercise Event. Missions flown in formal MAJCOM-sponsored exercises
  (i.e. Red Flag, Green Flag, etc.). Flag events will include operations with Full Scale
  Inert/Live ordnance (see 5.6).
  A2.1.27. Flare Event. Inflight release of self-protection flares during a tactical mission
  profile as a threat response. Event requires actual release and is limited to logging of one
  event per engagement. A normal event will be considered 15 flares, but 1 flare expended will
  satisfy the event requirement.
  A2.1.28. FAC(A) Mission. Special capability mission designed to develop proficiency in
  airborne forward air control of armed attack fighters in support of actual or simulated ground
  forces, and can be flown as element lead or the supporting wingman (if FAC(A) qualified).
  Mission elements include: intel scenario and mission planning, actual or simulated interface
  with TACS/AAGS C2 network, target acquisition and identification, FAC-to-fighter brief,
  target marking, positive control (Type 1, 2, or 3) of ground attack fighters employing
  simulated or actual ordnance against designated targets, integration of ground and heliborne
  fire support elements (if available), identification and neutralization of enemy air defenses,
  BDA, and INFLTREP. FAC(A) missions may be counted towards CAS or Commander
  Option mission requirements. Within a FAC(A) mission are ASC events and currency
  requirements.
  A2.1.29. Instructor Pilot (IP) Mission. Special capability mission. Instructors will log an
  IP mission when acting in an instructor capacity to update IP currency. IP missions may be
  dual-logged with any other RAP mission or special capability missions.
  A2.1.30. Instrument Mission (ANG: N/A). Basic skills mission. Training designed to
  ensure instrument proficiency. RAP events may be accomplished on an instrument mission
  provided accomplishment does not interfere with the primary goal of instrument training.
  Units are allocated flying hours for every pilot to accomplish their minimum basic skill
  requirements. Priority for this type of mission should be strange field approach training.
  Instrument/AHC missions may be applied to monthly lookback at a maximum of one of
  either per month (3 for 3 month lookback). Instrument missions logged in the MRT/FMS
  must have an IP or SIM-IP running the IOS and critiquing performance.
  A2.1.31. J-SEAD Mission. SEAD mission integrating non-F-35A assets operating in
  support of the SEAD role. Assets include, but are not limited to, RC-135 Rivet Joint, EA-6B,
  EP-3, ECR Tornado, etc.
  A2.1.32. LOW A/A Event. An event defined as performing realistic, mission-oriented A/A
  operations while below 1000’ AGL to the pilot’s qualified minimum altitude block (see
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              75


  Table 6.1). The event includes skills necessary to search for, and engage offensively, an
  aerial target at low altitude. Only one event may be logged per mission. Accomplishing this
  event updates LOWAT currency.
  A2.1.33. LOW A/G Event. An event defined as performing realistic, mission-oriented low
  altitude operations while below 1000’ AGL to the pilot’s qualified minimum altitude block
  (see Table 6.1). The event includes low altitude navigation, tactical formation, defensive
  maneuvering to avoid or negate threats, and A/G attacks. Only one event may be logged per
  mission. Accomplishing this event updates LOWAT currency.
  A2.1.34. Low/Slow Speed Threat VID Intercept Event. Tactical intercept performed to
  accomplish the tactical objective (ID the bogey, ID and kill the bandit, etc) on a target below
  5000 feet AGL with airspeed less than 250 KIAS. Fighter should counter threat maneuvers
  and weapons engagement zones, consider environmental factors, attain turning room and
  energy at end game, practice ID/ROE procedures, and terminate when briefed objectives or
  training rule stops are reached. These intercepts will not update ACBT currency. Two events
  may be logged per mission, but not on the same engagement.
  A2.1.35. Moving Target LGB Attack Event. Self or buddy-laser LGB attack against a
  target in motion. Until AFTTP 3.1 hit criteria is available, units will develop simulated
  ordnance hit/miss criteria using available weapons publications (e.g. Jedi Knight Phase 3
  report, TTPs in development, and USAFWS papers).
  A2.1.36. Moving Target Strafe Event. Tactical strafe attack against a target in motion.
  Both HAS and LAS are desired. Until AFTTP 3.1 hit criteria is available, units will develop
  simulated ordnance hit/miss criteria using available weapons publications. (e.g. Jedi Knight
  Phase 3 report, TTPs in development, and USAFWS papers).
  A2.1.37. Mission Commander (MCC) Mission. Special capability mission. Mission where
  the pilot acted in the capacity of a MCC for a joint/composite mission responsible for two or
  more types of aircraft with four or more total aircraft, or more than four own MDS aircraft
  versus a minimum of two pre-planned adversary aircraft. May be logged in conjunction with
  baseline training requirements.
  A2.1.38. Non-demanding Sortie. A day sortie that provides the pilot with the opportunity
  to regain basic flying proficiency without excessively tasking those skills that have been
  under used during the non-flying period. Authorized events flown on a non-demanding sortie
  are: Instruments, AHC, low level navigation at or above 1000 feet AGL, basic WD and basic
  intercepts (not to exceed 2v2). SQ/CCs may delete sorties/events from this non-demanding
  sortie list, depending on unit tasking and the individual’s capabilities.
  A2.1.39. Non-effective Sortie. A sortie planned and launched as a training mission, test
  mission, basic skills sortie, or collateral sortie that, due to some circumstance (WX, IFE,
  maintenance, etc.), fails to accomplish a sufficient number of planned events. While
  maintenance statistics support historical data for sorties that are cancelled before takeoff, a
  non-effective sortie or ―air abort‖ is not usually captured by maintenance for future FHP.
  These sorties must be accounted for in building unit flying hour programs.
  A2.1.40. OCA-A Mission. Mission designed to develop proficiency in OCA-A tactics.
  Mission elements include: Intel scenario and tactical mission planning, execution of striker
  escort and sweep tactics designed to detect, engage, and negate simulated adversary aircraft
76                                                 AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010


  which are operating within specific commit criteria (i.e., range, airspace corridor, vul time,
  etc.), and in-flight report. Emphasis on signature management and flow priorities.
  A2.1.41. Red Air Mission. A/A mission where tactics, aircraft simulation, weapon systems,
  and/or maneuvering is limited to the extent that complete own MDS training is not
  accomplished. Restrictions which limit aircraft capabilities to some level which might be
  encountered in combat do not require logging the mission as Red Air. For CMR pilots, Red
  Air mission allocations in the RTM are a maximum cap on degraded training. Red air
  missions flown above max allocation do not count toward RAP mission
  requirements/lookback. However, CMR pilots may accomplish individual events (e.g.
  formation landing, AAR, etc.) and update applicable currencies. Unused Red Air allocations
  should be flown in one of the other A/A training mission categories.
  A2.1.42. SEAD Mission. Mission designed to develop proficiency in SEAD tactics.
  Mission elements include: Intel scenario and integrated mission planning to support force
  package objectives, execution of tactics to detect and negate enemy IADS, to include SAM,
  AAA systems, and critical IADS nodes, employing adversary tactics and weapons
  capabilities to disrupt force package employment/destroy package assets, and in-flight report.
  Emphasis on signature management and flow priorities.
  A2.1.43. Secure Voice Event. Requires proper radio configuration during tactical mission
  accomplishment. Only one event may be logged per sortie.
  A2.1.44. Slow Shadow Event. Intercepting slow flying aircraft (rotary or fixed wing) and
  maintaining surveillance without being detected.
  A2.1.45. Surface Attack Tactics (Night) [SAT-(N)] Mission. Mission designed to develop
  proficiency in SAT. Mission types include Strategic Attack (SA), Air Interdiction (AI), and
  Offensive Counter Air-Surface (OCA-S). Mission elements include: Intel scenario and
  tactical mission planning, execution against actual or simulated threats, simulated or actual
  WD against a tactical target, and INFLTREP. Simulated attacks may be conducted against
  realistic targets IAW local restrictions. Emphasis on signature management and flow
  priorities. Additional night missions may be applied toward day requirements. All night
  missions should include the use of DAS. All DAS aided missions should include
  covert/lights out training.
  A2.1.46. Terminal Attack Control with SOF Event. Emphasis on this event is SOF
  interoperability and support during non-traditional CAS missions. Training requires scenario
  development, terminal attack, and brief/debrief with SOF personnel. One event, culminating
  in actual or simulated weapons release, may be logged per target.
  A2.1.47. Terminal Attack with EOTS Event. These training events integrate EOTS with
  the terminal attack of a CAS target. EOTS use includes target identification, designation,
  tracking, and weapons guidance. Requires JTAC/FAC(A) control culminating in actual or
  simulated weapons release.
  A2.1.48. Urban Target Attack with EOTS Event. Training in urban environments
  emphasizes target identification, attack axis limitations, and avoiding collateral damage, in
  close proximity to and coordination with friendly forces. One event, culminating in actual or
  simulated weapons release (IAM, LGB), may be logged per target.
AFI11-2F-35AV1 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              77


  A2.1.49. Urban Target Strafe Event. Training in urban environments emphasizes target
  identification, attack axis limitations, and avoiding collateral damage, in close proximity to
  and coordination with friendly forces. One event, culminating in actual or simulated weapons
  release, may be logged per target. Both LAS and HAS are desired.
A2.2. Weapons Employment Terms:
  A2.2.1. Dry Pass. Weapons delivery pass during which no ordnance is expended. A2.2.4
  Familiarization (FAM). See Chapter 5.
  A2.2.2. Foul. A penalty directed to a specific aircraft and crew for actions inconsistent with
  established procedures or safety considerations. Verbal warnings will not be substituted for
  fouls. A second foul or any dangerous pass will result in mandatory expulsion from any
  further deliveries during that mission and a gross error score for the event. A foul will be
  charged IAW flying directive publications.
  A2.2.3. Hit. Any munitions impact within the weapons criteria established for that event.
  A2.2.4. Inadvertent Release. Ordnance which has released without command by the pilot
  or by a verified system malfunction. Impact will not be scored.
  A2.2.5. Multiple Release. More than one weapon released against the same target on a
  single pass.
  A2.2.6. No Spot. A weapons release during which no impact was observed. No score or
  error will be assigned.
  A2.2.7. Qualification QUAL. See Chapter 5.
  A2.2.8. Tactical Delivery. A delivery using patterns and techniques that minimize final
  flight path predictability, yet allow sufficient time for accurate WD. Wings level time on
  final will be limited to 5 seconds or less when aircraft will descend below 4,500 feet AGL.
  Timing will be from completion of roll-out until initiation of recovery. Level, IAM, LGB,
  and climbing deliveries may exceed 5 seconds. All tactical deliveries will normally include
  recovery to egress parameters.
  A2.2.9. Unintentional Release. Ordnance released due to pilot error. Will be scored as
  gross error regardless of impact point.
