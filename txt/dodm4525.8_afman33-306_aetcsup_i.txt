                                             C1. CHAPTER 1
                                      MAIL PIECE PREPARATION
C1.1. GENERAL
This Chapter is designed to assist anyone who creates a mail piece or prepares one for mailing. It pro-
vides cost-effective policies and procedures for preparing items to be shipped via the United States Postal
Service (USPS) and provides references to technical postal knowledge when needed. Topics include mail
piece design, restrictions on the use of postage paid for with appropriated funds, cost reduction tips, car-
rier selection, selecting the proper mail class, special mail services, required postal markings, Express
Mail, reply mail methods, drop-shipments, international mail, nonprofit and subsidized postage rates,
reporting misuse of appropriated fund postage, forms of postage, mailing lists, return and delivery
addresses, ZIP+4 Codes and barcodes, envelopes and packaging. All questions not answered by this
Chapter are to be referred to the local official mail manager.
C1.2. MAIL PIECE DESIGN
Several things affect the design of a mail piece and must be considered before preparing the artwork and
doing the printing. They include the form of outgoing postage, how postage will be paid on items the
recipients are to return, postage discount requirements, and type of special service (e.g., registry). Contact
the local official mail manager to make sure the selected form of postage is applicable and the necessary
permits and postage funds are available before designing and printing mail pieces or address labels. Con-
tact the USPS' Account Representative or the Mail Piece Design Specialist at the Postal Business Service
Center for design assistance when needed.
C1.3. RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF APPROPRIATED FUND POSTAGE
Appropriated funds may be used to pay the postage for official mail relating solely to the business of the
United States Government. Thus, appropriated funds may be used:
C1.3.1. By the Army National Guard and Air National Guard only for mailings pertaining to Federal
Government matters.
C1.3.2. By an activity or activity commander for inviting non-DoD dignitaries to attend official social
functions held in behalf of a DoD Component or sponsored in the name of a DoD Component. The offi-
cial status of the function shall be clearly stated or readily apparent in the invitation. For example, an
installation commander is authorized to use appropriated fund postage to invite community officials to an
installation open house.
C1.3.2.1. (Added)(AF) Example of an activity authorized function; graduation invitations from
Professional Military Education facilities to commanders and first sergeants, etc.
C1.3.3. By retired members of a DoD Component for merchandise return or business reply items fur-
nished to them by a DoD activity.
C1.3.4. For mailing change-of-address cards only for changes of address resulting from carrying out writ-
ten military orders. A copy of the orders must be presented with the cards.
C1.3.5. For mailing bulk shipments of daily, weekly, housing and similar bulletins to supported installa-
tions and activities only. Less costly methods of shipment must be considered and used when feasible.
C1.3.5.1. (Added)(AF) Distribute this type of official information through the OMC when possible.
The OMC, however, will not deliver such things to base housing areas. Sponsoring activities may
16                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


do this if authorized by the installation commander. Under no circumstances will they place any
matter in residents’ mailboxes. Base bulletins, electronic mail (E-mail) listings, base papers, etc.,
should be used as much as possible to distribute housing area type information.
C1.3.6. By contractors as follows:
C1.3.6.1. Contracts or purchase orders requiring DoD Components to pay the postage and fees shall
require the use of mail classes and special postal services that will be at the lowest possible cost to DoD
consistent with required delivery date (RDD), security, accountability, and USPS requirements.
C1.3.6.1.1. (Added)(AF) In general, only Government Printing Office printing contractors doing
Air Force jobs should use Air Force postage and mailing permits. Other contractors should prepay
the postage and be reimbursed under their contract.
C1.3.6.2. Envelopes and labels used by a contractor shall bear the preprinted return address of the fur-
nishing DoD activity and not that of a private person, concern, organization, or contractor.
C1.3.6.3. When authorized, the appropriate type of special service shall be preprinted on the envelope or
label in the manner required by USPS. Contractors shall not add markings for these services.
C1.3.6.4. A DoD permit may be used for large mailings if USPS mailing requirements are met. Contrac-
tor use of permits must be approved by the DoD Component. Applications shall be submitted per Domes-
tic Mail Manual (DMM) (reference (f)) P040 for prepaid postage.
C1.3.6.5. Postage meters may be used when approved by the DoD Component. The meters shall be
licensed to and under the control of the DoD Component concerned.
C1.3.6.6. When the use of a permit or postage meter is not practical, contractors shall prepay the postage
and fees and be reimbursed by including such costs as a separate item on the invoice.
C1.3.7. For DoD Component authorized periodicals as follows:
C1.3.7.1. Distribution mandated by DoD Component regulations or directives.
C1.3.7.2. Individual copies to higher headquarters in the chain of command and other public affairs
offices for administrative purposes.
C1.3.7.3. Copies in bulk to subordinate units for distribution to the units' members. Other, less expensive
transportation methods shall be used if they can provide the same or faster delivery time than mail.
C1.3.7.4. A copy to a private person, firm, or organization in response to a specific, written, unsolicited
request only if the periodical contains no advertising. The request shall be kept on file in the editor's
office as long as the periodical continues to be mailed in response to that request. The mailing list shall
be limited to the minimum consistent with the needs and best interests of the command and shall not
include members of the audience the publication is designed to reach.
C1.3.7.5. Copies to other Government Agencies and libraries, hospitals, or schools to promote the overall
command public affairs program.
C1.3.7.6. Copies of State-level Army National Guard and Air National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve
Command command-level periodicals containing no advertising to the home address of individual mem-
bers. These copies shall be mailed at the Standard Mail rate or appropriate Periodicals rate. The mailing
of lower command-level periodicals is not authorized.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                          17


C1.3.7.6.1. (Added)(AF) Air National Guard (ANG) command-level is defined as wing-level.
Training letters and schedules are not considered periodicals.
C1.3.7.7. Commercial enterprise publications may be mailed only in accordance with paragraphs
C1.3.7.1., C1.3.7.2., and as bulk shipments to deployed units when that is the most cost-effective way to
ship them. Postage on such shipments must be applied by the DoD activity, not the commercial enterprise
publisher.
C1.3.8. By commanders per DoD Directive 1015.6 (reference (g)) to discharge their morale, welfare, and
recreation (MWR) mission with the following restrictions:
C1.3.8.1. Appropriated fund postage may be used to mail a consolidated packet containing information
regarding the existence of all available MWR activities to personnel eligible to use them; however, the
packet shall neither contain information on revenue producing items or events nor violate other parts of
this Manual. A revenue-producing item or event is one where the recipient or participant pays for all or
part of the cost of the service or goods received. The category of the organization providing the goods or
service is immaterial.
C1.3.8.2. Appropriated fund postage shall not be used to mail personal correspondence. Individuals con-
verting appropriated funds to their personal use, or the use of another person, may be charged under 18
U.S. Code 641 (reference (c)). The "or the use of another" applies to personnel making or authorizing
policy. When this Manual was written, Section 641 read as follows: "Whoever embezzles, steals, pur-
loins, or knowingly converts to his use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys or dis-
poses of any record, voucher, money, or thing of value of the United States or of any Department or
Agency thereof, or any property made or being made under contract for the United States or any Depart-
ment or Agency thereof; or whoever receives, conceals, or retains the same with intent to convert it to his
use or gain, knowing it to have been embezzled, stolen, purloined or converted -- shall be fined under this
title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; but if the value of such property does not exceed the
sum of $1000, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both. The word
'value' means face, par, or market value, or cost price, either wholesale or retail, whichever is greater."
C1.3.9. By prisoners in a non-pay status for personal mail per DoD Component directives.
C1.3.10. Official announcements of official retirement, promotion, award, change-of-command, and ship
commissioning or decommissioning ceremonies. The location and time of a directly related reception
may be noted if it does not result in any increase in cost to the Government, and the notation does not
include advertisement for or endorsement of any enterprise.
C1.3.11. Items associated with tax filing programs established by DoD Components under 10 U.S.C.
1044 (reference (h)).
C1.3.12. Information that would otherwise be unofficial may be included in official command publica-
tions such as daily, weekly, housing, and family support group-type bulletins/newsletters when the local
commander determines its dissemination will contribute to morale or esprit de corps. Such information
may be included only if it is not otherwise prohibited by this manual, it does not exceed 20 percent of the
printed space used for the official information, there will be no increase in cost to the Government, and it
does not include personal wanted/for sale advertisements.
C1.3.13. The consolidation of personnel offices and other functions has created the necessity to mail
many transactions that were previously handled in person. The following, and similar items, may be
mailed using appropriated fund postage.
18                                 DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C1.3.13.1. Military/civilian retirement packages.
C1.3.13.2. Items sent to various enlisted promotion boards and officer selection boards after the com-
mand sent the initial package.
C1.3.13.3. Individual requests for microfiche copies of their military and civilian personnel file.
C1.3.13.4. Changes to an individual's Thrift Savings Plan account and Government-sponsored life/health
insurance policy.
C1.3.13.5. Requests by military personnel that they be added to the housing list at their next duty station.
C1.3.13.6. Paperwork relating to Do-It-Yourself (DITY) moves and personal property damage claims
resulting from permanent change of station (PCS) moves.
C1.4. UNAUTHORIZED USES OF APPROPRIATED FUND POSTAGE
Appropriated funds may be used only for official mail relating solely to the business of the United States
Government. Thus appropriated funds may not be used to pay postage for:
C1.4.1. Or in support of, Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAF) or their functions. NAFIs exist
for the purpose of providing support where appropriated funds are not available or are not adequate. Offi-
cial mail centers may apply postage to mail of NAFIs of the Department of Defense providing the NAFI
pays the USPS for the postage. Unless specifically otherwise authorized by the local commander, the
NAFI must deposit the cost of the postage directly into the USPS-owned trust account specified by the
official mail center.
C1.4.2. Material not covered by the Private Express Statutes and delivered by a method other than the
USPS, such as FEDEX, UPS, AIRBORNE and other private carriers. The appropriate postage shall be
applied to items covered by the Private Express Statutes, before turning them over to a private carrier for
delivery. (See DL1.1.41. above for a list of the Private Express Statutes and exemptions/suspensions.)
C1.4.3. Non-mailable items, such as items that are undersized and oversized, overweight, or explosive.
Obtain information about items that are not mailable from the local post office. Also, contact private car-
riers to determine if they can accept items that are prohibited in the U.S. Mail.
C1.4.3.1. (Added)(AF) Official Mail Centers should refer organizations to their Traffic Manage-
ment Office (TMO) for items not authorized shipment via U.S. Mail.
C1.4.4. Postcards, unless the cards are DoD or DoD Component-approved forms.
C1.4.5. Information sent by DoD Components about non-mandatory events. Use the official mail center,
the installation bulletin or newspaper, or other methods to distribute this type of information.
C1.4.6. Invitations to social functions to satisfy personal social obligations, even if they are the result of
an official position. For example, Christmas parties and receptions hosted by senior commanders are not
official business. Appropriated fund postage shall not be used to mail invitations to these functions.
C1.4.7. Personal congratulatory letters from one individual to another in a private capacity. This does
not prohibit the use of appropriated fund postage by heads of staff agencies or commanders to fulfill their
official morale and esprit de corps obligations to members of their organization or persons in their areas
of technical responsibility. For example, sending congratulatory letters to people selected for advanced
schooling, promotions, and letters of condolence are authorized.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                         19


C1.4.8. Resumes and completed employment applications. Comptroller General of the United States
Decision B-249061, May 17, 1993 (reference (i)), defines personal expenses as expenses "...necessary to
qualify [an] employee for his or her job..." The submission of a job application is a personal expense as
it is the first qualifier in attaining any job.
C1.4.9. Personal mail, holiday and birthday greetings, unofficial retirement announcements, and similar
material. However, activities may use appropriated fund postage for holiday greetings when international
diplomacy dictates.
C1.4.9.1. (Added)(AF) The Comptroller General has determined the cost of holiday cards and the
postage to mail them are personal expenses of the officer who authorizes their use, even when the
agency’s name rather than the officer’s name appears on the card (Comp Gen B-247563.4, 11 Dec
96).
C1.4.9.2. (Added)(AF) Care packages and similar items are not official matters that are related
exclusively to U.S. Government business. Care packages are considered personal mail and cannot
be mailed using appropriated funds. Units and agencies overseas cannot send personal support
items through Intra/Inter Theater Delivery Service (IDS).
C1.4.10. Correspondence from international commands such as North Atlantic Treaty Organization offi-
cial correspondence. This mail normally must be prepaid in the country in which it is posted. When
appropriated fund postage is provided, the administrative agent assigned by DoD Instruction 7000.14-R,
Vol 11A (reference (j)) is responsible for procuring and monitoring its use.
C1.4.11. Correspondence of foreign military personnel. Foreign military personnel who are required by
regulations of their own government to file reports or otherwise correspond with their embassy or govern-
ment shall do so at their expense. However, appropriated fund postage may be used if the parent U.S.
Government activity determines the correspondence is official mail relating solely to the business of the
U.S. Government.
C1.4.12. Mail posted in foreign post offices shall bear the postage of the country where it is mailed unless
there is a bilateral agreement that has special procedures for accepting DoD mail with U.S. postage.
C1.4.13. Anything mailed by vendors or concessionaires or their employees. This does not preclude use
authorized by paragraph C1.3.3., above.
C1.4.14. Fund or other types of charity drives not officially endorsed by the Department of Defense or the
DoD Component concerned.
C1.4.15. Unofficial biographies and unit histories.
C1.4.16. Dependent school year books, Navy Cruise Books, and other unofficial items such as announce-
ment cards, thank you cards, memory albums, and biographies.
C1.4.17. Announcements and attendance responses related to DoD Component branch anniversary par-
ties and similar events.
C1.4.18. Mailings by or for private associations, such as unit associations, wives clubs, Boy Scouts,
Association of the United States Army, and the Air Force Association.
C1.4.19. Mailing matter donated by individuals for donation to other individuals or charitable organiza-

C1.4.19.1. (Added)(AF) Intra/Inter Theater Delivery Service cannot be used to send donated mat-
ter.
C1.4.20. Social events related to the reassignment or resignation of individuals not in command posi-
tions.
C1.4.21. RSVP items. The rate of return on these items is too low to justify the expense of pre-paying the
postage on each item.
C1.4.22. Mailing costs associated with payment of Government travel credit card billings. Travelers are
automatically reimbursed for these costs in the part of the per diem that covers incidental expenses.
(NOTE: Refer people with questions about this to www.dtic.mil/perdiem/ and advise them to search on
"card billings."
C1.4.23. All other matters not related solely to the business of the Department of Defense.
C1.4.23.1. (Added)(AF) Official mail is for matters that are exclusively U.S. Government business.
Official mail channels must not be used to send or forward personal items.
C1.4.23.2. (Added)(AF) Appropriated funds cannot be used for movement of issued/purchased
personal gear in a temporary duty (TDY) status. Personnel are required to maintain and carry
their equipment with them.
C1.4.24. Use the decision diagram at Figure C1.F1. to determine if appropriated fund postage may be
used in cases not covered by this Manual.
C1.5. COST REDUCTION TIPS
C1.5.1. (Added)(AF) Any organization/agency wishing to routinely enter items into the official mail
system should coordinate with the local OMM to ensure the specifics and intent of this paragraph
are reviewed and complied with prior to acceptance at the official mail center. Refer organizations
that wish to enter items into the MPS to unified command or MAJCOM guidance pertaining to
Intra-theater Delivery Service.
C1.5.1. Ask the following about all mailings:
C1.5.1.1. What will happen if the item is not mailed?
C1.5.1.2. What will happen if the item is mailed less frequently?
C1.5.1.3. Do all the addressees need to receive the item?
C1.5.1.4. Can some other less expensive means of transporting the message or item be used? (For exam-
ple: telephone call, electronic data transfer, the Internet or Web, E-mail, freight, small parcel carrier.)
C1.5.1.5. Can it be combined or transported with something else?
C1.5.1.6. Is it being mailed at the lowest postal rate legally possible that meets the required delivery date
(RDD) and security requirements?
C1.5.1.7. Can postage costs be reduced by reducing weight or size? Consider microform or CD-ROM
alternatives for mailing publications and other items. Reduce weight by printing on both sides of paper,
selecting the lightest weight paper, and using all available printing space.
C1.5.1.8. Can postage costs be reduced by changing preparation methods?
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                        21


C1.5.2. Use standard, letter-size envelopes whenever possible to minimize postage surcharges for size or
weight and faster delivery. Use large envelopes only when folding the contents will damage them or the
volume is too great for letter-size envelopes.
C1.5.3. Limit use of merchandise return, business reply mail, and special services such as registered, cer-
tified, and insured.
C1.5.4. Limit use of Express Mail per section C1.10., below.
C1.5.5. Prepare items so they qualify for postage discounts when economically feasible.
C1.5.6. Use post cards whenever possible. The postage on a post card is significantly less than a letter.
DMM C100.2 (reference (f)) specifies post card dimensions and thickness.
C1.5.7. Annually review recurring mailings for continued necessity.
C1.5.8. Update mailing lists as changes occur.
C1.5.9. Consolidate mailings to common addresses. Prepare according to the DMM C100.1.3. and
C600.1.2.
C1.5.9.1. (Added)(AF) Use consolidated mail when you collect several items of the same class dur-
ing specified periods, (usually 1 or 2 days) that are going to the same addressee or several activities
on the same installation. You can consolidate mail in USPS 2-day priority envelopes or boxes (pre-
ferred method), larger envelopes (flats) or boxes. Select a container best suited to hold the volume
of mail you are consolidating. Place everything going into OMC for consolidation in a container.
Avoid under or overfilling containers. Do not place parcels that might damage other mail in the
consolidated container. Note the types of consolidated direct shipments:
C1.5.9.2. (Added)(AF) Administrative Pouch. A container for items meeting those minimum
requirements in paragraph C3.1. Unclassified material may go in an Optional Form (OF) 65B, US
Government Messenger Envelope. You may containerize CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET material
together. List only the SECRET material on the DD Form 2825, Internal Receipt. Register contain-
ers with SECRET material. Do not use DoD or USPS pouches as outside containers to consolidate
registered mail. Use administrative pouches when there is enough mail for one location to justify
consolidation.
C1.5.9.3. (Added)(AF) Logistics Pouch. Combine high-priority supply items into one shipment
because it is cost-effective and gets better transit time. This is especially true for shipments to an
APO. In the continental United States (CONUS), the TMO must select the route, rate, and mode to
meet user requirements at the least overall cost.
C1.5.9.3. (AETC) The official mail center (OMC) will coordinate with the local traffic management
function (TMF) to obtain rate schedules for all commercial freight carriers servicing the installation to
ensure that non-first class matter is transported by the most economical means. Internet access meets this
requirement; however, an alternate means of obtaining the information is necessary should internet access
be interrupted. Refer customers with bulk shipments to the TMF to determine the most economical carrier
and (or) mode.
C1.5.9.4. (Added)(AF) Weapons Systems Pouch (WSP). WSP service is for high-priority
(MICAP-999) logistics items sent from air logistics centers to APOs. AF Form 607, Weapons Sys-
tems Pouch Tag, or AF Form 351, Weapons Systems Pouch (WSP) Label, identifies these pouches as
requiring high-priority handling in the MPS. The USPS does not recognize WSPs, so do not use the
22                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


tags or labels for domestic mail. Offices that receive WSPs must coordinate prompt pickup with
their servicing mail facility.
C1.5.10. Require adequate printing time to allow economical mail service.
C1.5.11. Be sure that contracts for printing and distribution contain specifications for using the most eco-
nomical mailing services consistent with the priority of the case.
C1.5.12. Use computer output formats that make maximum use of available print space to reduce the
weight of mailings.
C1.5.13. Use drop-shipments for zone-rated mail when cost effective.
C1.5.14. When possible, use FAX instead of mail for documents three pages in length or less. Mail doc-
uments addressed to multiple addressees when the labor to fax them is greater than preparing them for
mailing. Mail copies of documents that are faxed only when an original signature is required for legal
reasons.
C1.6. SELECTING A CARRIER
C1.6.1a. (Added)(AF) USPS is the only carrier authorized for Official Mail Transportation paid by
appropriated funds in overseas areas. Organizations should be directed to the local TMO for other
alternatives.
C1.6.1. "Letters," as defined by the Private Express Statutes, and those items listed in DMM G011.4,
shall be transported via USPS unless they are covered by an exemption. (See DL1.1.41. for a list of the
Private Express Statutes and exemptions/suspensions.)
C1.6.2. All items not required to be shipped through the USPS (see paragraph C1.6.1., above) shall be
shipped by the most cost-effective carrier meeting the RDD and security requirements. In addition to car-
riers' fees, consideration must be given to how much it costs to prepare the item for shipment via the var-
ious carriers and whether or not the carrier delivers the item directly to the addressee but charges for
it.C1.6.3. When mailed, official matter shall move at the lowest postage and fees cost to meet the RDD,
security, accountability, and Private Express Statutes requirements.
C1.6.4. Use of USPS services shall be coordinated with local USPS account representatives, USPS Busi-
ness Service Centers, or military post office (MPO).
C1.7. SELECTING CLASS OF MAIL
The "Domestic Mail Classification Selection Table, "Table C1.T1., shall be used as a guide in selecting
the correct mail class. The DMM (reference (f)) and International Mail Manual (IMM) (reference (k))
provide specific guidance for types of items that may be mailed under each class of mail.
C1.8. SELECTING SPECIAL MAIL SERVICES
The Government Losses in Shipment Act (40 U.S.C. 726) (reference (l)) and the Government's general
self-insurance policy prohibit Federal Agencies from using registered and insured mail for the sole or pri-
mary purpose of obtaining postal indemnity. Claims shall not be made against the USPS for indemnity on
items lost or damaged in the mail. However, Comptroller General of the United States Decision, 58
Comptroller General 14 (1978), (reference (m)) allows the Government to use registered or numbered
insured mail to obtain the "special" services they offer such as added protection or proof of delivery.
Limit the use of the special services to when law or DoD Regulation requires them or when mission
essential. Items listed below as authorized for a special service may be sent without the special service or
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                          23


by a less costly special service. However, a more costly special service shall not be used. (Example: An
item authorized certified service shall not be sent by registered mail.) Internal receipts shall be used
instead of PS Form 3811, "Return Receipt," or other special services whenever possible. The Heads of
the DoD Components are authorized to approve the use of these services on an exception basis. This
authority may not be delegated lower than installation or equivalent activity official mail manager
(OMM). The following are DoD-wide authorized uses:
C1.8.1. Registered. See the DMM S911 (reference (f)) for preparation, fees, etc. Official mail is regis-
tered for security, not indemnity. The full value must be declared on registered articles and the appropri-
ate registration fee paid. Do not estimate a value for classified and other items not having intrinsic value.
In these cases, pay the minimum registry fee. Waybills, invoices, etc., shall be placed inside the package,
not attached to the outside. Registered may be used for:
C1.8.1.1. (Added)(AF) The ADO will seal registered mail with mucilage, glue or paper tape; never
plastic or masking tape. The envelope’s material must be able to absorb the ink from the date
stamp applied at the OMC. See DMM 503 for specific guidance.
C1.8.1.1. Criminal investigation evidence.
C1.8.1.2. Cash, original vouchers (disbursing and collecting),and voided or canceled checks.
C1.8.1.3. One-of-a-kind, irreplaceable, sensitive, controlled, rare, or pilferable items and items having a
replacement cost in excess of $5,000. Such items was 20,000 include but are not limited to calibration
equipment, supply items, historical matter (including film), library materials, original manuscripts and
camera-ready mechanicals and art work.
C1.8.1.4. Mailable shipments of Government-owned firearms.
C1.8.1.4.1. (Added)(AF) Individuals or organizations wishing to mail official government-owned
firearms should be directed to the local TMO for guidance. In most cases, the TMO will be the
originator of any firearms mailed through the official mail system.
C1.8.1.5. Commercial transportation tickets, boarding passes, and Air Mobility Command authorizations
when personal delivery or pickup is not possible.
C1.8.1.6. Classified documents as required by DoD 5200.1-R (reference (n)) and DoD Component direc-
tives.
C1.8.1.7. Accountable forms when addressed to military post office's (MPOs).
C1.8.1.8. Environmental samples.
C1.8.1.9. Notification of radiation exposure.
C1.8.1.10. Mailing former evidence to its owner.
C1.8.1.11. Mobilization preassignment orders to international addresses where this service is authorized.
C1.8.1.12. Deceased personnel's personal effects having intrinsic value being sent to the next of kin. The
value of the items must be declared. This is necessary for reimbursement in the event of loss or damage.
Indemnity paid for loss or damage of personal effects shall be forwarded to the next of kin.
C1.8.1.13. Other communications and parcels that by law, DoD Directive, or DoD Component directive
must be registered.
24                              DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C1.8.1.13.1. (Added)(AF) Limit special postal services to instances when law, DoD, or Air Force
instructions require them, or when mission essential. Follow these guidelines: If the mail needs
additional security, only use registered mail since it alone gets special handling and is traceable.
Internal receipts for First-Class mail satisfy most receipt and security requirements of unclassified
administrative communications. OPRs who write Headquarters Air Force directives that specify
use of special mail services must coordinate their draft directives with SAF/XCIF before publica-
tion. MAJCOMs, field operating agencies (FOA), and direct reporting units will coordinate for
their commands. Do not use special mail services just to get a record of mailing or delivery, or to
trace communications sent between two Air Force activities, unless a DoD or Air Force directive
authorizes it.
C1.8.1.14. (Added)(AF) Registered mail. Registration of official mail gives it more security in
transmission, and provides a chain of receipts from the time of acceptance to final delivery. Regis-
tered mail receives the most protection given to U.S. mail, and has a low loss rate. The extra control
over registered mail may delay it, causing longer transit times than First Class or Priority mail.
C1.8.1.14.1. (Added)(AF) The serving postal facility (USPS or APO) issues registry labels to the
OMC. The OMC uses one of these numbers on each registered item. The OMC may issue a block
of registry labels to activity distribution offices that frequently send registered mail. Large volume
mailers requiring registered service should prepare containers complete with labels they get from
the OMC. They should use container numbers instead of registered mail label numbers on consol-
idated accountable mail.
C1.8.1.14.2. (Added)(AF) The OMC obtains a receipt for registered mail on AF Form 627, Applica-
tion for Registration or Certification of Official Mail, or PS Form 3877, Firm Mailing Book for
Accountable Mail, from the post office at the point of mailing.
 (Added) (AF) Note: The accepting postal facility places date stamp imprints across seams, flaps or
tape strips to make it easy to spot tampering.
C1.8.1.14.3. (Added)(AF) In the Air Force, the following items may also be registered:
C1.8.1.14.3.1. (Added)(AF) SECRET material.
C1.8.1.14.3.2. (Added)(AF) CONFIDENTIAL material sent out of the CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii,
Puerto Rico, and U.S. possessions and trust territories.
C1.8.1.14.3.3. (Added)(AF) NATO Confidential information (see AFPD 31-4, Information Security
[formerly DoD 5200.R/AFR 205-43]).
C1.8.1.14.3.4. (Added)(AF) Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) counterintelligence
information; and AFOSI technical services equipment, including items such as badges or creden-
tials.
C1.8.1.14.3.5. (Added)(AF) Accountable forms when addressed to overseas MPOs, when additional
safeguards are necessary.
C1.8.1.14.3.6. (Added)(AF) Logistics mailings when they require protection in transit, like account-
able assets equipment to overseas destinations (AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1, USAF Supply
Manual, Basic Air Force Supply Procedures).
C1.8.1.14.3.7. (Added)(AF) Aircraft accident reports and formal aircraft incident reports, to pro-
vide security and prevent unauthorized disclosure of these reports while out of Air Force control.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                        25


C1.8.1.14.3.8. (Added)(AF) Records of trial by courts-martial.
C1.8.1.14.3.9. (Added)(AF) Examples of cases in which to use a return receipt on registered mail
include:
C1.8.1.14.3.9.1. (Added)(AF) Claims and litigation proceedings documents. As an alternate choice,
use certified mail with a return receipt when possible.
C1.8.1.14.3.9.2. (Added)(AF) Personal effects of intrinsic value of deceased personnel sent to the
next of kin.
C1.8.1.14.3.10. (Added-AETC) Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) material, only when it appears nec-
essary to have proof of dispatch or receipt of FOIA correspondence.
C1.8.2. Certified. See DMM S912 for definition, preparation, fees, etc. Certified may be used for:
C1.8.2a. (Added)(AF) Certified mail does not have widespread application within the Air Force.
Certified service provides a receipt of mailing, and a record of delivery for First-Class mail. It pro-
vides no indemnity. Use it only within the U.S. domestic and military postal system and only when
law, DoD, or Air Force directives require it. Consider Delivery Confirmation versus Certified Mail
to save appropriated funds.
C1.8.2.1. Letters to establishments being declared "off limits."
C1.8.2.2. Adverse enlisted and officer efficiency reports and other similar actions.
C1.8.2.3. Controlled test material.
C1.8.2.4. Instructional material marked "For Faculty Use Only."
C1.8.2.5. Items requiring shipment by Priority Mail when the certified fee is less than the fee for other
services that provide proof of delivery.
C1.8.2.6. Equal employment opportunity case material mailed to complainants and their representatives.
C1.8.2.7. Reduction-in-force notices sent to civilian employees on authorized absence.
C1.8.2.8. Final decisions of a contracting officer issued under the dispute clause of a Government con-
tract.
C1.8.2.9. Show cause or cure notices issued under the default clause of a Government contract.
C1.8.2.10. Claims and litigation proceedings documents.
C1.8.2.11. Any other communication for which receipts are essential to create or preserve rights granted
to the United States under a Government contract.
C1.8.2.12. Debarment letters.
C1.8.2.13. Delayed entry packets.
C1.8.2.14. Summonses and subpoenas.

C1.8.2.19. Dishonored checks (not applicable to non-appropriated fund Instrumentalities).
C1.8.2.20. Questionnaires to injured persons.

C1.8.2.21.3. Officer elimination cases.
C1.8.2.21.4. Any other communication, receipt of which is essential to create or preserve the rights
granted to the U.S. Government in connection with criminal proceedings.
C1.8.2.22. Other communications and parcels that by law, DoD Directive, or DoD Component directive
must be certified.
C1.8.2.23. (Added)(AF) Additional authorized uses of certified mail are:
C1.8.2.23.1. (Added)(AF) CONFIDENTIAL information to or from DoD contractors (DoDD
5200.l; AFI 31-401; DoDD5220.22, National Industrial Security Program; and AFI 31-601, Industrial
Security Program Management).
C1.8.2.23.2. (Added)(AF) Sensitive medical records or test results.
C1.8.2.23.3. (Added)(AF) Transmittal of identification cards to persons who are unable to pick
them up in-person, and letters to retrieve identification cards that are no longer valid.
C1.8.2.23.4. (Added)(AF) Final Notice on Expiration of Nontemporary Storage Accounts (AFPD
24-5, Transporting and Storing Personal Property).
C1.8.2.23.5. (Added)(AF) Defense Activity for Nontraditional Education Support test material.
C1.8.2.23.6. (Added)(AF) Notification to obligated reservists of failure to complete required train-
ing.
C1.8.2.23.7. (Added)(AF) Notices to spouses when members elect less than 100 percent Survivor

tice documents.
C1.8.2.24.2. (Added)(AF) Notice to obligated reservists for failing to participate in unit training.
C1.8.2.24.3. (Added)(AF) Debarment or Revocation/Suspension Letter notices to individuals not
permitted access to a base, or to some activities on the base for failing to comply with Air Force
standards. Applies only when the notice goes to non-active duty personnel or when it is not possible
to make sure these personnel receive the correspondence. In overseas areas, use registered mail,
with return receipt, to send such mail to people with an international address.
C1.8.3. Unnumbered insured mail is delivered as ordinary mail and shall not be used. No exceptions
shall be granted.
C1.8.4. Numbered insured mail may be used only:
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                         27


C1.8.4.1. For accountability reasons when proof of delivery is required for valuable administrative or
logistical equipment, supplies, and printed matter.
C1.8.4.2. To return borrowed library and similar items when required by the non-DoD lender.
C1.8.5. Proof of Delivery. A PS Form 3811, "Return Receipt," or DD Form 2825, "Internal Receipt,"
may be used for proof of delivery. See Figure C1.F2., and paragraphs C1.8.5.1. and C1.8.5.2., below.
C1.8.5.1. DD Form 2825 shall normally be used between DoD activities instead of PS Form 3811. When
DD Form 2825 is used, the addressee shall immediately verify the contents are all there, sign the original
copy, and return the original copy to the sender. The sending activity shall take follow up action to deter-
mine if the item was received if the DD Form 2825 is not returned within 14 workdays from the date of
dispatch (unless the normal two-way transit time is longer). (NOTE: Delivery Confirmation may be
more cost-effective where it is available.)
C1.8.5.1.1 (Added)(AF) Certificate of Mailing. PS Form 3817, Certificate of Mailing, gives proof of
mailing. Air Force, and other organizations using the OMC, must not use this service. If an orga-
nization needs proof that it mailed an item, it should use DD Form 2825 and keep a log or other
internal record.
C1.8.5.2. PS Forms 3811:
C1.8.5.2.1. PS Forms 3811 show the date and to whom the item was delivered and the actual delivery
address if it is different from the address used by the sender. PS Form 3811 may also be used to restrict
an article's delivery to the addressee (or his or her agent) when proof is necessary that the addressee per-
sonally received the item. A PS Form 3811 may be used only on Express Mail, numbered insured, regis-
tered, and certified mail when the use of DD Form 2825 is not appropriate. PS Form 3811 shall not be
used on articles enclosed in consolidated containers unless the postage and special service fee are prepaid
on the item they are on.
C1.8.5.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) Do not use return receipts on items sent between Air Force activities, as
USPS charges for them. Instead, use DD Form 2825, or AF Form 74, Communications Status
Notice/Request, or an internal receipt.
C1.8.5.2.2. See DMM R900 (reference (f)) for fees and DMM S911 (reference (f)) for preparation
requirements. Since most of these items are delivered, it is much less expensive to pay the larger charge
for PS Form 3811-A, "Request for Return Receipt (After Mailing)," on the few items not delivered than
to pay for a PS Form 3811 on every item mailed. Extensive use of PS Forms 3811-A indicates a system
problem needing correction.
C1.8.5.2.2.1 (Added)(AF) Return Receipts. Do not use return receipts on items sent between Air
Force activities as USPS charges for them. Instead, use AF Form 74, or an internal receipt. A PS
Form 3811 provides a mailer proof of delivery. It can be used on numbered insured, registered,
and certified mail. A return receipt may be used to restrict an article’s delivery to the addressee (or
his or her agent) when proof of addressee receipt is needed.
C1.8.5.2.2.2. (Added)(AF) Examples of the authorized use of certified mail, with return receipt,
are:
C1.8.5.2.2.2.1. (Added)(AF) Casualty assistance and notification.
C1.8.5.2.2.2.2. (Added)(AF) Personal effects of no intrinsic value of deceased personnel sent to next
of kin.

C1.8.5.2.2.2.3. (Added) (AF) Report of survey.
C1.8.5.2.2.2.4. (Added)(AF) Notice of indebtedness to U.S. Government.
C1.8.5.2.2.2.5. (Added)(AF) Letter of transmittal and orders for extended active duty to reserve
personnel.
C1.8.5.2.2.2.6. (Added)(AF) Adverse action from the civilian personnel office.
C1.8.5.2.2.2.7. (Added)(AF) Notices to spouses when members elect less than 100 percent Survivor
Benefit.
C1.8.5.2.2.2.8. (Added)(AF) Contracting documents requiring proof of delivery.
C1.8.5.3. PS Form 3804, "Return Receipt for Merchandise," is available only for merchandise sent at cer-
tain rates of postage. PS Form 3804 is less expensive than using PS Form 3811 and the insured, regis-
tered, or certified service, which must be used with it. However, a receipt is obtained every time this
service is used. Filing such receipts is labor intensive and costly. See DMM R900 (reference (f)) for fees
and Section S900 (reference (f)) for preparation requirements.
C1.9. MARKINGS
All mail, except letter-size First-Class Mail, shall be marked to show the mail class. Items mailed as Pri-
ority Mail must have either USPS Label 106 (Priority Mail Strip), Label 106-A (Priority Mail (tape)),
Label 107 (Priority Mail Sticker), or Label 107-R (Priority Mail Sticker) attached. (See "Domestic Mail
Classes, Endorsements, and Levels of Service Table" (Table C1.T2.). For International Mail, see section
C1.13.) The markings shall be worded and placed as required by the DMM (reference (f)) and IMM (ref-
erence (k)) Official mail centers shall either return to the originator all mail, except letter-size First-Class
Mail, that is not marked with a mail class or contact the originator to determine the contents so the appro-
priate mail class may be selected.
C1.9.1. The class of mail endorsements (Priority, Standard, Special Standard, etc.) are placed about
one-fourth of an inch below the postage meter imprint or postage stamp. They should be 1/4 to 1/2 inch
high.
C1.9.2. Place markings for special services (registered, certified, etc.) above the address and to the right
of the return address. See DMM S911 (reference (f)).
C1.9.2.1. (Added)(AF) Overseas ADOs are not required to endorse class of service for flats or par-
cels addressed to intra/inter-theater or CONUS pouch locations.
C1.9.3. (Added)(AF) Label parcels containing dangerous, radioactive, or magnetic matter accord-
ing to AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments. Don’t mail
such parcels to, from, or between overseas areas.
C1.10. EXPRESS MAIL
C1.10.1. Express Mail and the overnight services offered by other carriers shall not be used:
C1.10.1.1. To respond to directed actions or requests for information unless using it is the only way to
meet a short suspense. In the event of a short suspense, call the one who established the suspense and
request an extension. Extensions should be granted when possible.
C1.10.1.2. For the purpose of correcting administrative oversights such as a late suspense when adequate
time existed.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                            29


C1.10.1.3. On days before weekends or holidays unless the sender has verified someone will be available
to accept it and work on it during the weekend or holiday. This does not apply to activities having an
MPO return address when Express Mail is the most cost-effective way to accomplish a mission within
time, security and accountability requirements.
C1.10.2. Installation OMMs or their equivalents are authorized to approve the use of overnight services.
C1.10.3. Selection of Carrier
C1.10.3.1. Express Mail shall be used only when the contents are covered by the Private Express Statutes
or addressed to an MPO address or post office box address.
C1.10.3.2. The General Services Administration's (GSA) contract carrier shall be used when the contract
carrier can deliver the item in the required delivery time and at the contract price without violating the Pri-
vate Express Statutes. The contract carrier shall not be used for items addressed to MPO addresses.
C1.10.3.3. Other overnight carriers may be used only when the GSA contract carrier can not deliver the
item on time or at the contract price.
C1.10.4. Postage on Express Mail shall be paid by using postage meter imprints, postage stamps, or by
placing an Express Mail Corporate Account number in the customer number block on the Express Mail
label. These accounts are only authorized at the user level. MACOM-wide or DoD Component-wide
accounts defeat the decentralized budgeting and payment of postage policy and are not authorized.
C1.10.5. Every piece of incoming Express Mail shall be examined to see if it meets delivery time guaran-
tees. When it does not, send the mailer a copy of the addressee's copy of the Express Mail label and
remind the mailer to request a refund. The mailer shall submit PS Form 3533, "Application and Voucher
for Refund of Postage and Fees," when Express Mail items are not available when promised. PS Form
3533 is available from post offices. Establish local procedures to control refunds.
C1.10.5.1. (Added)(AF) For computing delivery times, Express Mail is considered delivered when
it reaches the MPO or OMC. Official mail centers will create form letters to send to mailers with a
copy of the addressee copy of the Express Mail label and remind the mailer to request a refund
when items do not meet delivery time guarantees. The mailer shall submit PS Form 3533 when
Express Mail items are not delivered within standards. OMMs should establish a system to track
the delivery of Express Mail Military Service items sent using OM funds via the USPS web site and
submit PS Form 3533 when Express Mail items are not available when promised. Coordinate with
local resource advisor to determine the refund check format. Send refund checks to the unit
resource advisor using a hand receipt.
C1.10.6. Express Mail service is not available to and from all MPOs. Contact the local post office for
availability information.
C1.10.6.1. (Added)(AF) Express Mail is not available between MPOs.
C1.10.7. Many Post Offices do not deliver to the addressee at DoD addresses, even when that service has
been paid for. When that is true, use another carrier or Post Office to Post Office Service instead of the
more costly Post Office to Addressee Service. Check with the addressee in advance to determine the best
and most cost-efficient service to select.
C1.10.7.1. (Added)(AF) OMMs must refer outgoing Express Mail, except such mail containing
classified materials or addressed to MPOs, to the TMO for determination of the most cost-efficient
30                                 DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


carrier. USPS is the only carrier available for Express Mail shipments to MPOs. Since USPS
Express Mail may contain classified material, it must be processed by the OMC on DD Form 2825.
C1.10.7.1. (AETC) Confidential and secret documents and equipment may be shipped via any of the
approved DoD blanket purchase authorization (BPA) small package express carriers if time constraints do
not allow the use of US Postal Service registered mail. Use DD Form 2825, Internal Receipt, and AETC
Form 444, Request for Express/Next Day Air Mail Service, for this purpose. (DD Form 2825 is prescribed
by DODM 4525.8_AFMAN 33-306, DOD Official Mail Manual. Refer to that publication for guidance
on completing the form.) Properly wrap and conceal identities on controlled and classified items accord-
ing to applicable governance. Do not identify the sensitive nature to the carrier. Tender shipments to the
small package carrier for next day delivery to a US military destination or approved contractor facility.
Private residences, hotels, motels, and postal boxes are not authorized delivery addresses. Do not allow
the carrier to maintain custody of the shipment over weekends or holidays. Shipments must not be haz-
ardous and must be within the carrier's established weight and size restrictions. Shipper will not, under
any circumstances, release the carrier from obtaining a delivery signature from the consignee. Official
mail managers (OMM) will work with the local TMFs to establish local procedures. Handle and safe-
guard all small package express shipments as classified information until the actual classification is deter-
mined; use the mailing address of the activity distribution office (ADO). For additional guidance, see
DOD 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part II, Cargo Movement, Chapter 205, Paragraph T.
C1.10.8. (Added)(AF) Use of Express Mail. Express Mail service exceeds the delivery needs of most
mailers. Use Express mail applying these guidelines:
C1.10.8.1. (Added)(AF) Logistics Material. You can use Express Mail for logistics shipments iden-
tified as MICAP or movement precedence 999. You can send these and only these categories as
Express Mail without further justification.
C1.10.8.2. (Added)(AF) Administrative Material. You can use Express Mail for administrative
material (correspondence, documents, data tapes, etc.) only when the addressee’s mission prevents
an extension to allow First-Class or Priority mail use.
C1.10.8.3. (Added)(AF) USPS Express Mail may be used in addition to registered mail for the
movement of SECRET material when it is the most cost-effective way to meet a program require-
ment within time, security, and accountability constraints. This method is authorized for ship-
ments through USPS within and between the U.S. and its territories. DO NOT USE THIS
SERVICE TO SEND CLASSIFIED TO, FROM, OR BETWEEN APO, FPO, OR FOREIGN
ADDRESSEES. DO NOT EXECUTE THE “WAIVER OF SIGNATURE AND INDEMNITY” ON
THE USPS EXPRESS MAIL LABEL 11-B UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. Base OMMs will
establish and publicize procedures for handling Express Mail within their area of responsibility in
an expeditious manner, keeping in mind that any express mail package could contain SECRET
material. Follow prescribed guidelines for maintaining appropriate accountability for SECRET
material according to AFI 31-401. Obtain a receipt or signature from addressee for all incoming
Express Mail shipments.
C1.10.8.3. (AETC) Incoming Express Mail may be delivered directly to the servicing ADO.
C1.10.8.3.1. (Added-AETC) Base OMM will establish internal approval procedures for ADOs who
receive Express Mail directly from the servicing USPS. Base OMM establish a daily cutoff time for
base activities to use this service for outgoing material. DD Form 2825 and AETC Form 444 will
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                         31


accompany each outgoing package. Document security personnel will turn Express Mail over to the
OMC for postage metering. File AETC Form 444 with the postal report as a supporting document.
C1.10.8.3.2. (Added-AETC) Recruiting squadrons will use the most cost effective Express Mail ser-
vice available. Headquarters Air Force Recruiting Service (HQ AFRS) will identify the carrier.
Squadrons have the authority to research and implement the use of a less expensive service if it
becomes available. Coordinate any overnight mail carrier changes with HQ AFRS before imple-
mentation. Each recruiting squadron is responsible for establishing internal approval procedures
on the use of Express Mail.
C1.10.8.3.3. (Added-AETC) AETC Form 444 is available as a means to document justification for
using Express Mail. Report the cost of express mailings on the semiannual postal expenditure
report.
C1.10.8.4. (Added-AETC) The following types of documents are authorized to use Express Mail:
C1.10.8.4.1. (Added-AETC) Legal documents when specific time limits are established by regula-
tions, statutes, courts, or non-Air Force government agencies.
C1.10.8.4.2. (Added-AETC) Promotion recommendation forms and officer and enlisted perfor-
mance reports that must meet command evaluation boards.
C1.10.9. (Added)(AF) Express Mail service is not available for intra-theater use. Also, USPS con-
siders Express Mail delivered when the local MPO receives it.
C1.10.10. (Added)(AF) The Chief of Electronic Communications will decide whether or not ADOs
sign DD Forms 2825 for incoming Express Mail.
C1.11. REPLY MAIL METHODS
C1.11.1. Courtesy Reply Mail
C1.11.1.1. Courtesy reply mail consists of an envelope, card, or label bearing the correct preprinted deliv-
ery address, bar code, and Facing Identification Mark (FIM). The one placing the item in the mail pro-
vides the return address and postage.
C1.11.1.1.1. (Added)(AF) Courtesy reply mail should only be used when the use of E-mail surveys
and questionnaires will not accomplish the same effect.
C1.11.1.2. Courtesy reply ensures use of the correct address.
C1.11.1.3. Some suggested uses:
C1.11.1.3.1. Many DoD activities have small, subordinate offices. Courtesy reply mail items provide a
convenient method for the subordinate office to communicate with the main office. Items having pre-
printed addresses and bar codes also move through the mail faster.
C1.11.1.3.2. Return of surveys and questionnaires.
C1.11.1.3.3. Return of correspondence course-related items.
C1.11.1.3.4. Internal receipts.
C1.11.2. Pre-metered and Pre-stamped Reply Mail shall:
C1.11.2.1. Be placed only on items for a known requirement. For example: If a mailing of 500 pieces is
going to be made, place postage only on 500 pieces.
32                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C1.11.2.2. Be addressed to a DoD activity.
C1.11.2.3. Be used only when all of the following conditions are met:
C1.11.2.3.1. A reply is requested on official business from an activity or individual outside the U.S. Gov-
ernment who is not required by law to reply.
C1.11.2.3.2. The receipt of the reply is in the best interest of the U.S. Government.
C1.11.2.3.3. The cost is less than business reply mail or merchandise return service. Paragraph
C1.11.3.1.7., below, explains how to calculate it.
C1.11.2.4. Not be used for fund or other types of charity drives officially endorsed by the Department of
Defense or the DoD Component concerned.
C1.11.2.5. Pre-metered reply mail shall be prepared per the DMM P030.1.5 (reference (f)).
C1.11.3. Merchandise Return and Business Reply Mail
C1.11.3.1. Merchandise return service (MRS) and business reply mail (BRM) shall:
C1.11.3.1.1. Be addressed to a DoD activity.
C1.11.3.1.2. Be used only when a reply is requested on official business from an activity or individual
outside the U.S. Government who is not required by law to reply and when the receipt of the reply is in the
best interest of the U.S. Government.
C1.11.3.1.3. Not be used to receive responses from DoD activities or personnel except retired personnel,
Reservists not assigned to a unit, or when the activity OMM determines this is the most cost-effective
method to return correspondence course materials. DoD activities can return these items at their own
expense through their official mail center and save the U.S. Government the applicable accounting fee.
These items should be placed in consolidated mail whenever possible.
C1.11.3.1.4. Not be used for fund or other types of charity drives officially endorsed by the Department
of Defense or the DoD Component concerned.
C1.11.3.1.5. Shall be used only when it will likely be less expensive than providing pre-metered or
pre-stamped postage or when the DMM P030.1.5 (reference (f)) does not allow use of pre-metered post-
age. The information given below can be used to determine whether or not to establish a permit or an
account and whether or not to use BRM on a mailing even after a permit or permit/account has been estab-
lished.
C1.11.3.1.6. The cost for each method must be calculated to determine which method is less expensive
for a particular mailing. The outcome is affected by the number of reply pieces sent out, the percentage
of reply pieces expected back, the postage per piece returned, the amount of the permit or permit/account
fee, whether the permit or permit/account fee has already been paid, and the amount of the accounting fee
per item returned.
C1.11.3.1.7. Compute the costs by using the formulas in this paragraph.
C1.11.3.1.7.1. The symbols used in the formulas are defined as follows:
A = Expected percentage of return for the mailing
D = Total cost for pre-metered or pre-stamped return postage.
F = Flat fee for permit or permit/account.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                     33


I = Accounting fee per piece returned.
P1 = Postage cost per piece sent out.
P2 = Postage cost per piece returned.
R = Cost reduction created by using BRM/MRS.
S = Number of reply pieces to be mailed out.
T = Estimated total dollar cost for BRM/MRS.
C1.11.3.1.7.2. Compute the pre-metered or pre-stamped dollar cost by using the formula D = P1*S.
(NOTE: Enter the average cost if the postage is zone rated.)
C1.11.3.1.7.3. The estimated total dollar cost for BRM/MRS is computed using the formula T = (((A/
100)*S)*(P2+I))+F. (NOTE: Enter a zero if the permit/account fee has already been paid.)
C1.11.3.1.7.4. The amount of cost reduction created by using BRM/MRS is calculated using the formula
R = D - T.
EXAMPLE:
The following are given:
   Anticipated percentage of return for the mailing: emsp; A = 80%
   BRM permit fee and accounting fee: F =$400
   Accounting fee per piece returned: I = $0.08
   Postage cost per piece sent: P1 = $0.33
   Postage cost per piece returned: P2 = $0.33
   Number of reply pieces to be mailed out: S = 5,000
Using the formula in C1.11.3.7.2., above, the pre-metered or pre-stamped cost is $1,650.00.
Using the formula in C1.11.3.7.3., above, the estimated total cost for BRM/MRS is $2,040.00.
Using the formula in C1.11.3.7.4., above, the cost reduction by using BRM/MRS is -$390.00. (In this
example, the cost to use BRM/MRS is $390.00 more than pre-metered or pre-stamped postage.) (NOTE:
If the $400.00 BRM permit fee and accounting fee were previously paid for some other mailing, the cost
to use BRM on this mailing is $10.00 less than the pre-metered or pre-stamped cost.)
C1.11.3.2. BRM:
C1.11.3.2.1. Is charged at the First-Class or Priority Mail rate plus a per-piece accounting fee.
C1.11.3.2.2. The Qualified Business Reply Mail Rate shall be used whenever possible (see DMM R100
(reference (f)) for more information.).
C1.11.3.2.3. Shall be prepared per the DMM S922.4 through S922.6 (reference (f)).
C1.11.3.2.4. The card format shall be used when possible.
C1.11.3.2.5. Art work for BRM pieces shall be coordinated with the post office to insure proper format
prior to printing.
C1.11.3.2.5.1. (Added)(AF) Use BRM when it is to the Air Force’s advantage. For instance:
34                                 DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C1.11.3.2.5.1.1. (Added)(AF) When there will be a low return rate and the mailing will likely be
cheaper than providing pre-metered postage.
C1.11.3.2.5.1.2. (Added)(AF) When there will be a low return rate but the mailer wishes to induce
a greater response rate from non-DoD personnel and activities in the interest of the Air Force by
providing free postage.
C1.11.3.2.6. (Added)(AF) Don’t use BRM if your location historically receives very few BRM mail-
ings.
C1.11.3.3. MRS:
C1.11.3.3.1. Shall not be used until USPS assigns a permit number.
C1.11.3.3.2. Is charged at the appropriate Priority or Standard Mail rate plus a per-piece accounting fee.
C1.11.3.3.3. Shall be prepared per DMM S923.5 (reference (f)).
C1.12. DROP-SHIPMENT
Under a drop-shipment, the mailer enters the items into the USPS at the delivering post office rather than
the mailer's post office. The mailer provides and pays for the transportation to move the items to the
delivering post office and applies local zone postage. The transportation cost plus local zone postage can
be less expensive than postage from the mailer to the addressee on zone-rated mail. The instructions for
drop-shipments are found in various DMM sections. All drop-shipments of items addressed to MPOs
shall be entered into the mail stream at a USPS operated facility, not a postal facility operated by the mil-
itary. Such drop-shipments may be made to USPS facilities in the appropriate military post office gate-
way cities (New York, Miami, and San Francisco).
C1.13. INTERNATIONAL MAIL
C1.13.1. Postal Union mail: All official correspondence (letters and cards) may be sent as airmail. Pack-
ages containing official matter may be sent as airmail if the urgency in delivery justifies the costly airmail
letter rates.
C1.13.2. Parcel post shall be sent only as surface mail.
C1.13.3. Special delivery may be used only for delivery in countries where special delivery is the only
reliable means of ensuring prompt delivery.
C1.13.4. Consult the IMM (reference (k)) or local post office for applicable postage, customs tags, spe-
cial services, and restrictions before preparation for mailing.
C1.14. NONPROFIT AND SUBSIDIZED RATES
The Department of Defense is not authorized to send mail at nonprofit or subsidized rates (i.e., special
bulk Standard rates, Library rates, and the following Periodicals rates; in country, special nonprofit class-
room, science of agriculture, limited circulation, and limited circulation science of agriculture).
C1.15. REPORTING MISUSE OF APPROPRIATED FUND POSTAGE
Unauthorized use of appropriated fund postage shall be:
C1.15.1. Reported to the commanders of the individuals involved for appropriate investigation.
C1.15.2. Reviewed to determine any appropriate reimbursement of postage and fees. Legal or adminis-
trative action shall be taken to obtain reimbursement when appropriate.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                        35


C1.16. FORMS OF POSTAGE
Some forms of postage affect how a mail piece is designed. Before designing and printing mail pieces or
address labels, contact the local official mail manager to make sure the selected form of postage is appli-
cable and that necessary permits and postage funds are available. The various forms of postage and their
general applicability follow:
C1.16.1. Permit
C1.16.1.1. Permit mailings shall be used, when cost effective, on large volume mailings of identical size
and weight. Contact your official mail manager prior to preparing any camera-ready copy or doing any
printing. Permit formats and instructions are in DMM P040 (reference(f)) for prepaid postage.
C1.16.1.2. Permit mail entered in the USPS on behalf of a DoD activity by a contractor shall bear the
DoD activity's return address, not the contractors'.
C1.16.1.3. USPS requires advance notice on all permit mailings. Postage and fees are recorded on the
USPS forms presented with the mailing.
C1.16.1.4. Manifest postage systems use a permit and are applicable where large volumes of parcels and
letters are mailed. They need not be of a uniform size and weight. A computer is required. Contact your
local USPS account representative or Business Service Center for details.
C1.16.1.5. Permit mailings are not authorized at MPOs.
C1.16.2. Metered Postage
C1.16.2.1. Metered postage shall be used to the maximum extent possible on mail that cannot be sent
under a permit.
C1.16.2.2. Requests for permission to use logos and slogans on ad plates in postage meters shall be pre-
pared and submitted according to DoD Component directive applying to logos and slogans.
C1.16.2.3. Chapter 2 sets forth procedures for controlling and safeguarding postage meters.
C1.16.3. PC Postage and Postage Stamps
C1.16.3.1. Postage stamps or PC Postage shall be used by activities that do not generate enough mail to
justify the leasing or purchasing of metering equipment and on items not qualifying for permit postage or
pre-metered postage.
C1.16.3.2. Chapter 2 sets forth procedures for ordering, controlling, and safeguarding these items.
C1.16.4. BRM and MRS. These forms of postage have special design requirements. Contact your offi-
cial mail manager prior to preparing any camera-ready copy or doing any printing. BRM formats and
instructions are in DMM S922 (reference (f)) for prepaid postage. MRS formats and instructions are in
DMM S923 (reference (f)) for prepaid postage.
C1.16.5. DoD Official Intratheater Mail (DoDIM). Items mailed from one MPO to another MPO in the
same theater shall have "DoD Official Intratheater Mail" or "DoDIM" typewritten, rubber stamped, or
mechanically printed in the area where the postage and fees for special services normally would be placed
on U.S. Mail. It can be used on all classes of mail. It will be treated and processed within the Military
Postal Service as if postage and fees had been paid on it. Claims may be made and will be processed in
accordance with normal procedures up to the point of making payments. Payments shall not be made for
lost or damaged items or refunds of postage. Tell the claimants whether the item was signed out by the
36                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


delivering MPO and who signed for it. In the case of registered mail, claimants shall be told where and
when it was last signed for.
C1.16.5.1. (Added)(AF) DoD Official Intratheater Mail (DoDOIM) includes delivery between
many APO AE and AP ZIP Codes. DoDOIM mail must not enter the USPS system. Consult MAJ-
COM develop pouching and routing instructions for unauthorized locations. Official items
addressed to a personal lockbox must bear either the DoDOIM endorsement. Any agency dispatch-
ing a mass mailing of 20 or more pieces will sort the mailing by APO ZIP Code and numerically by
personal lockbox number.
C1.16.5.2. (Added)(AF) Items sent using DoDOIM will be treated and processed the same as if
appropriated funds postage had been applied. The rules and restrictions of paragraph C1.3 and
C1.4 apply.
C1.16.5.3. (Added)(AF) USPS Claims are not authorized; however, locations may use PS Form
1510, Mail Loss and Rifling Report, to conduct tracer action of DoDOIM items.
C1.16.6. Postage Due Penalty Mail.
DoD activities may be authorized to use Postage Due Penalty Mail under conditions specified in Chapter
2. Authorizations to use "Free Mail" (for personal mail) do not apply to Postage Due Penalty Mail. Post-
age Due Penalty Mail shall be prepared per the DMM E060.5.7 (reference (f)). Postage Due Penalty Mail
SHALL NOT BE USED to notify next of kin of casualties.
C1.17. MAILING LISTS
C1.17.1. Update addresses in mailing lists as changes become known, and at least annually, to remove
addressees no longer needing the material being mailed, to minimize delivery delays, and to avoid unde-
liverable mail that wastes postage and printing costs.
C1.17.2. Effective July 1, 2002, all DoD-provided addresses and address lists shall be matched against
appropriate USPS Address Management System files using Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS)
software. Addresses that do not match shall be corrected or removed prior to delivering the address or list
to the requestor. USPS Account representatives and Postal Business Service Centers can provide more
information on how to have addresses and lists matched.
C1.17.2.1. (Added)(AF) Only USPS Coding Accuracy Support System certified mailing list will be
used.
C1.18. RETURN AND DELIVERY ADDRESSES
Incorrect and unreadable addresses are the same as no address. They waste postage and delay the ultimate
delivery of the item being shipped. The item being shipped may neither be delivered nor returned to the
sender when both the return and delivery addresses are incorrect, unreadable, or missing. See Chapter 3
for information on the assignment, format, printing, and uses of addresses within the Department of
Defense.
C1.19. ENVELOPES AND PACKAGING
C1.19.1. General
C1.19.1.1. All matter shall be packaged and marked in accordance with the requirements of the DMM
C010 (reference (f)). See DMM C020 (reference (f)) for information on the shipment of perishables, haz-
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                         37


ardous materials, restricted matter and non-mailable articles and substances. If in doubt, consult the local
post office, account representative, or Postal Business Service Center.
C1.19.1.2. Envelopes, mailing tubes, and other containers shall:
C1.19.1.2.1. Be only slightly larger than the material being mailed to minimize movement within the
envelope or container. The more the contents can move, the greater the chances for damage to the con-
tents or containers.
C1.19.1.2.2. Large enough for adequate cushioning on all sides of fragile contents.
C1.19.1.2.3. Bear only those logos, markings, slogans, or designs supporting an activity or its program
authorized in accordance with DoD Component directives covering such items and the DMM P030.4.13
(reference (f)). When authorized, these items shall be placed and printed in a manner that does not inter-
fere with automated mail processing.
C1.19.1.3. Does the envelope or address label:
C1.19.1.3.1. Contain complete delivery and return addresses with ZIP+4 Codes?
C1.19.1.3.2. Have the proper mail classification endorsement an appropriate special service marking
been correctly placed on the mail piece or address label?
C1.19.2. Letters and Flats
C1.19.2.1. All self-mailers shall be coordinated with the OMM and USPS Business Service Center to
make sure the DMM (reference (f)) requirements for automated mail processing are met. Improperly pre-
pared self-mailers catch on automated mail processing equipment resulting in damage to the self-mailer,
other mail, and the equipment.
C.1.19.2.1.1 (Added)(AF) Clasps, strings, staples, buttons, or protrusions that might impede or
damage the mail or mail processing equipment are prohibited. Mailings should be sealed with tape
or adhesive.
C1.19.2.2. Envelopes
C1.19.2.2.1. Uses:
C1.19.2.2.1.1. Letter-size envelopes can hold six sheets of paper and shall be used whenever possible.
Letter-size envelopes are defined in the DL1.1.20.
C1.19.2.2.1.2. Envelopes printed with airmail (red and white candy striped) markings shall be used only
for international mail. These envelopes should be purchased only by activities frequently using large
amounts of international airmail.
C1.19.2.2.1.3. Flat-size envelopes are defined in the DL1.1.16. Use flats only when:
C1.19.2.2.1.3.1. The envelope and its contents weigh more than one ounce when First-Class or Standard
Mail is used. A surcharge must be paid on such items weighing one ounce or less.
C1.19.2.2.1.3.2. The contents will be damaged by folding.
C1.19.2.2.1.3.3. The thickness of the contents and envelope would exceed 1/4 inch if folded and placed
in a letter-size envelope.
38                                 DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C1.19.2.2.1.4. Those activities with a recurring need for First-Class flats should use envelopes with a
green diamond border. Limit their use to items authorized First-Class service. USPS employees recog-
nize the green diamond border as First-Class Mail and treat it accordingly.
C1.19.2.2.2. Specifications:
C1.19.2.2.2.1. White envelope material shall be selected when that choice is available. When white
material is not available, the lightest shade available shall be used. See U.S. Postal Service Publication
25, "Designing Letter and Reply Mail," (reference (o)) for additional requirements.
C1.19.2.2.2.2. Use only black or dark blue ink for printing on envelopes. The ink shall not be fluorescent
or phosphorescent. See U.S. Postal Service Publication 25 (reference (o)) for additional requirements.
C1.19.2.2.2.3. Most automatic sealing or metering machines cannot seal envelope flaps extending more
than 3 inches from the fold and flaps on the ends of envelopes. V-shaped flaps work best. Purchase only
envelopes the machine can seal.
C1.19.2.2.2.4. Envelopes with clasps, staples, strings, buttons, or similar securing devices shall not be
used as they frequently jam automated mail processing equipment, injure employees, or damage other
mail.
C1.19.2.2.2.5. Windows in envelopes shall be placed so the longest dimension of the window is parallel
to the longest dimension of the envelope. (Windows placed so the longest dimension of the window is
parallel to the shortest dimension of the envelope automatically result in a nonstandard mail piece and a
surcharge must be paid. Nonstandard is defined in DL1.1.29.) Items placed in window envelopes shall
be prepared so that only the address is visible through the window and shall be large enough so they do
not move around in the envelope. See USPS Publication 25 (reference (o)) for additional requirements
concerning opacity of the inserts and relationship of the address to the window.
C1.19.3. Parcels
C1.19.3.1. Use mailing tubes only when no other container will protect the item being mailed. Mailing
tubes are heavy, hard to handle, and expensive to buy and mail.
C1.19.3.2. Is the carton or shipping container:
C1.19.3.2.1. Inexpensive and light weight?
C1.19.3.2.2. In good, sturdy condition without tears or holes?
C1.19.3.2.3. Strength, as indicated by the manufacturer's seal, suitable for the weight of the item to be
shipped?
C1.19.3.2.4. Are the contents adequately cushioned with light-weight material so they do not move when
the carton is shaken?
C1.19.3.2.5. Is the package properly closed with pressure sensitive, filament-reinforced tape? Do not use
cellophane or masking tape.
C1.19.3.2.6. Not wrapped with brown paper or anything else? (Doing so is labor intensive and the wrap-
pings are frequently damaged or destroyed during automated mail processing.)
C1.19.3.3. Are shipboard boxes packed in a sturdier outer container?
C1.19.3.4. Is the address label:
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                           39


C1.19.3.4.1. Placed on the top of the package?
C1.19.3.4.2. Easily readable from a distance of 30inches?
C1.19.3.5. Does the address label:
C1.19.3.5.1. Contain complete delivery and return addresses with ZIP+4 Codes?
C1.19.3.5.2. Have the proper mail classification endorsement and appropriate special service marking in
the correct place?
C1.19.3.5.3. Have the delivery point barcoded when authorized by section C3.9.?
C1.20. ACCOUNTABLE AND OTHER IMPORTANT ITEMS
C1.20.1. This includes classified material and other items whose distribution needs to be controlled.
C1.20.1.1. The transfer of these items directly between offices of the same activity is encouraged. When
that is not cost effective, or the items are for external activities, the items may be transferred through the
official mail center (OMC).
C1.20.1.2. Classified items shall be controlled, marked, packaged, and shipped as required by DoD
5200.1-R (reference(n)).
C1.20.2. Items being transferred through the OMC shall be placed in sealed containers (envelopes, boxes,
sacks, etc).
C1.20.3. The originator of the shipment shall prepare and affix to each item a Postal Service (PS) PS
Label 200-A or 200-B (Registered Mail), PS Form 3800 (Receipt for Certified Mail), or PS Form 3813-P
(Receipt for Insured Mail, Domestic or International). PS Form 3811 (Return Receipt) shall not be used
on these items as the required fee is not paid and they cannot be traced.
C1.20.3.1. (Added)(AF) Container numbers help control accountable communications while in Air
Force channels. When consolidating items using Air Force container numbers, it avoids paying the
USPS registered or certified mail fees on every accountable communication piece. When an Air
Force container number with a DD Form 2825 and proper USPS forms are used, a container can be
traced from the dispatching activity, through the OMC, into the USPS accountable mail (registered
or certified) system, to the receiving OMC, and on to the addressee.
C1.20.3.2. (Added)(AF) Each activity action or distribution office that processes accountable con-
tainers to other activities, either on-base or off-base, will apply the appropriate container numbers
on containers and DD Form 2825. Example: SCSL-04-003 (office symbol-last two digits of calen-
dar year-number containers starting with 001.) Place this alphanumeric designation on the
left-hand side of the container, beneath the return address. ADOs will develop a log or other track-
ing system for container numbers to avoid duplicating numbers.
C1.20.3.3. (Added)(AF) ADOs will follow the Domestic Mail Manual, instructions when marking
correspondence for special services. Specifically, place all markings for special services above the
address and to the right of the return address. This requirement applies to endorsements for regis-
tered, insured, certified, restricted delivery, and return receipt requested.
C1.20.3.4. (Added)(AF) The OMC may issue applicable PS forms or labels (registered, certified,
etc.) to ADOs that frequently use them. ADOs will use container numbers, not form or label num-
bers, of items eligible for consolidated mailings. If items are not eligible for consolidated mailings,
form or label numbers may be used instead of container numbers on DD Forms 2825.

C1.20.3.5. (Added-AETC) Use AF IMT 627, Application for Registration or Certification of Official
Mail, to transfer accountable mail to the USPS. The OMC will insert the unit’s container number
on AF IMT 627. The number corresponds to the registered or certified number in the “Registered
or Certified Number” block of the IMT. (AF IMT 627 is prescribed by DODM 4525.8_AFMAN
33-306, DOD Official Mail Manual. Refer to that publication for guidance on completing the form.)

                                             C2. CHAPTER 2
                                     MAIL CENTER OPERATIONS
C2.1. PURPOSE
This Chapter sets forth the policies and procedures for the operation of official mail centers. It includes
planning, mail processing, employees, postage procurement, security, dealings with the post office, con-
solidated mail, postage meters, postage stamps, emergency disposition of postage stamps and meters,
postage due penalty mail, change of address, contracting out, personal and unsolicited mail.
C2.2. PLANNING
C2.2a. (Added)(AF) Postmasters and OMMs will ensure all requirements of this paragraph are
addressed in overall OMC/MPO plans.
C2.2.1. Five-Year Plan. Each mail center shall have a 5-year plan that includes a vision statement regard-
ing what the official mail center will look like and what functions it will perform each year for the follow-
ing 5 years. The plan shall include a cost-effective investment strategy that supports the activity's
mission, reduces manual processing, replaces worn-out equipment, helps maintain the mail center's cus-
tomer satisfaction, improves operational efficiencies, and reaps postage discounts. It shall be updated
annually.
C2.2.2. Business Recovery Plan. Each mail center shall have a business recovery plan and update it
annually. A copy of the plan shall be stored outside the building housing the mail center (e.g., the instal-
lation's emergency operation center). As a minimum, the plan shall discuss actions to be taken when
some or all employees are absent, part or all of the mail center is unusable, some or all of the equipment
is defective or destroyed, necessary utilities are not available, and carriers or vendors are unable to pro-
vide supplies or services when needed. Also, include things such as emergency meeting locations for
employees; alternate mail center locations and equipment; emergency evacuation procedures; procedures
for handling terrorist threats; emergency employee recall procedures; and procedures for notifying emer-
gency services such as fire, police, and medical. All employees shall be familiar with the plan.
C2.2.3. Operation, Contingency, Exercise, and Similar Plans. These plans shall include provisions for
adequate personnel, postage, equipment, and vehicles for official mail center operations in the area
involved. The official mail centers shall support all DoD activities in their area regardless of the DoD
Component to whom the activity belongs.
C2.2.4. Security Plan. Each mail center shall have a security plan that incorporates appropriate informa-
tion from this Chapter, Chapter 4, and other appropriate information. The security plan shall be coordi-
nated with local security officials.
C2.3. MAIL CENTER OPERATIONS
C2.3.1. Centralized Processing. Outgoing and internal mail preparation procedures and processing shall
be integrated across DoD activity and DoD Component lines to ensure optimum use of personnel, equip-
ment, and postage cost reduction practices such as consolidated mailings, discounts, permit mailings, and
drop-shipments when the volume of mail is adequate to make them cost-effective. The use of vendors to
prepare mail for postage discounts is authorized when cost-effective. Maximum cooperation with other
Federal Agencies is encouraged.
C2.3.2. Incoming Mail:
44                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C2.3.2.1. Carriers should deliver incoming items to the addressee or the addressees' offices unless access
is denied for security reasons. United States Postal Service (USPS) mail deliveries are made as agreed to
in the DoD/USPS Agreement and agreements with local postal officials.
C2.3.2.2. Incoming mail the USPS has sorted to delivery point sequence shall be delivered as sorted. Do
not go through the mail to check for mis-sorted mail prior to delivery.
C2.3.3. Distribution cases in official mail centers shall be labeled with the street addresses and, when
appropriate, the secondary designators. This is not applicable to deployed units.
C2.3.4. Secure undelivered certified, registered, and Express Mail; items shipped through the General
Services Administration's overnight contract carrier; items bearing DoD accountable container numbers;
and similar items in a container approved for storing Secret material.
C2.3.5. Customer Information
C2.3.5.1. Operation schedules. Official mail centers (OMCs) shall provide their customers hours the
OMC operates, distribution trip schedules, close-out time for outgoing mail, etc.
C2.3.5.2. Addresses served. OMCs shall:
C2.3.5.2.1. Give customers a list of installations/organizations to which consolidated mail is sent.
C2.3.5.2.2. Send a list of the addresses they serve to activities sending them consolidated mail.
C2.3.5.2.3. (Added)(AF) Provide annual ADO training. Where OMCs are contracted, the OMM or
quality assurance evaluator will ensure they or the contractor conducts training.
C2.3.5.3. The above should be available on local area networks.
C2.3.5.4. Contact the official mail manager (OMM) at receiving activities every 6 months to make sure
the address for the consolidated mailing is still correct.
C2.3.6. Processing Accountable Items. OMCs shall treat anything they must sign for from the originator
or a carrier as an accountable item and obtain a receipt for it.
C2.3.6.1. Use automated tracking systems to control accountable mail and other important items when-
ever cost-effective. An automated tracking system eliminates hand-written logs and reliance on paper
files for tracking or proof of delivery. It can automatically sort items by route and delivery stop. It can
then generate delivery manifests that sequence the mail for delivery and provide a place for the recipients
to sign. This significantly reduces processing time and provides legible, easy-to-read records. Instant
searches and look-ups are possible. The available information can provide data for charge-back to
expense codes and productivity analysis of mail clerks. Carrier delivery times, delivery commitments not
met, and refund information can be easily obtained. Most systems include a report writer able to produce
just about any desired report.
C2.3.6.1.1. (Added)(AF) If an automated tracking system is used, the delivery clerk scans the
accountable items into the scanner system and prints two copies of the manifest for each ADO. The
clerk leaves a suspense copy at the Documents Section of the OMC. On the run, the clerk delivers
items and the manifest to the ADO, who verifies and signs for items on the hand held scanner. The
delivery information will be downloaded into the database once the clerk returns. After the last
run, the database for that day will be verified to ensure every item was delivered or returned to the
OMC.
C2.3.6.2. Incoming and Internal Items
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                           45


C2.3.6.2.1. Check each item by its registered, insured, certified, Express Mail, or carrier's number to
make sure everything is present before signing for it. Sign PS Forms 3811 and return them to the USPS
(see paragraph C2.10.4.4. for exceptions).
C2.3.6.2.2. Prepare a separate PS Form 3883 (Firm Delivery Receipt for Accountable and Bulk Delivery
Mail), or electronic equivalent, in triplicate for each office to which accountable items are to be delivered.
(PS Form 3883 is a three-part form.) When receiving the items, the delivering courier signs Part 2 -
Office, and leaves it with the official mail center's accountable mail clerk. The courier obtains a signature
from the receiving office on Part 1 - Delivery and Part 3 - Customer. The courier gives Part 3 to the office
receiving the items. The courier returns Part 1 to the official mail center's accountable mail clerk and
receives Part 2.
C2.3.6.2.2.1. (Added)(AF) On PS Form 3883, the “Received By” block for the unit mail clerk’s
name and signature has been omitted. To capture the data, modify the form as follows when
required: At the bottom (below the “Delivered By” block), line out “PS Form 3849 Barcode Num-
ber” and below it enter “Rec’d By.” After “Rec’d By,” UMC will print their name and write their
signature.
C2.3.6.3. Outgoing accountable items shall be consolidated when possible and cost-effective. Items
bearing PS Label 200-A (Registered Mail), PS Form 3800 (certified mail label), and Postal Service (PS)
Form 3813-P (U.S. Mail Insured) may be placed in consolidated containers. Postage and fees are not
required on each individual item, only the consolidated container.
C2.3.6.3.1. The consolidated container must be registered if it contains an item with PS Label 200-A.
C2.3.6.3.2. If the consolidated container does not contain an item with PS Label 200-A, it must be certi-
fied if it contains an item with PS Form 3800.
C2.3.6.3.3. If the consolidated container does not contain an item with PS Label 200-A or PS Form 3800,
it must be insured if it contains an item with PS Form 3813-P.
C2.3.6.3.4. Inquiries on the individual items in a consolidated mailing must be sent to the receiving mail
center, not the USPS because the USPS will have no record of these items.
C2.3.6.3.5. PS Form 3811 (Return Receipt) is not authorized on the individual items in a consolidated
mailing (see paragraph C2.10.4.4.).
C2.3.6.3.6. Consolidated containers containing items with PS Label 200-A, PS Form 3800, or PS Form
3813-P shall also contain a PS Form 3854 (Manifold Registry Dispatch Book) or an automated tracking
system-generated manifest showing these items.
C2.3.6.3.7. The originating OMC shall use PS Form 3877 if three or more consolidated containers or
other items are mailed at the same time.
C2.3.6.3.8. When a consolidated container is received, the receiving OMC and/or activity shall:
C2.3.6.3.8.1. Verify the contents against the enclosed PS Form 3845 or manifest and notify the originat-
ing OMC if all the listed items are not present.
C2.3.6.3.8.2. List the items on PS Form 3883 (Firm Delivery Receipt for Accountable and Bulk Delivery
Mail), PS Form 3849 (Delivery Notice/Reminder/Receipt), or an automated tracking system generated
receipt and obtain a signature.
46                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C2.3.6.3.8.2.1. (Added)(AF) OMCs will use PS Form 3883 for delivery of all accountable mail, or
automated tracking system generated receipts. PS Forms 3849 are not used at OMCs.
C2.4. EMPLOYEES
C2.4.1. Employee Qualifications. Mail center employees must:
C2.4.1.1. Possess a high degree of honesty and be trustworthy.
C2.4.1.2. Never have been convicted of crimes involving theft.
C2.4.1.3. Not have been previously removed for cause from work in a postal, mail, or other communica-
tions activity.
C2.4.1.4. Not have physical restrictions prohibiting duty involving prolonged standing, walking, or lift-
ing weights up to and including the maximum weight for a mail piece.
C2.4.1.5. Possess a valid civilian driver's license when duties may require driving.
C2.4.1.6. Have an Interim Secret clearance or be eligible for a Secret clearance based on having a favor-
able Entrance National Agency Check (ENTNAC) or National Agency Check (NAC) on file.
C2.4.2. Temporary Hires. Temporary employees such as summer student hires may be used in a limited
role. These employees normally do not have a security clearance; therefore, they shall not handle
accountable items (including overnight shipments) or open regular First-Class or Priority Mail. They
must work under the physical supervision of a regular mail center employee at all times.
C2.4.3. Employee Training. Mail center managers shall establish and carry out a program to train all
mail center employees to perform all mail center functions and to maintain their proficiency in those func-
tions.
C2.5. ENVIRONMENT
A mail center having a pleasant, business-like appearance helps create a happy work environment, good
morale, and quality work. The following contribute to the desired environment:
C2.5.1. Adequate ventilation, heating, and cooling are essential for good health and moral as well as qual-
ity work.
C2.5.2. Nicely decorated walls and ceilings help employee morale and production.
C2.5.3. Well-lighted mail processing areas reduce eye fatigue and improve work quality.
C2.5.4. Use cushion mats in areas where employees must stand for prolonged periods of time. When
possible, arrange for employees to be seated while working. It reduces foot and leg problems and need
not decrease production.
C2.5.5. A clean mail processing area free of excess supplies, equipment, clothing, and other matter looks
better and reduces the chances for loss, misplacement, and theft of mail.
C2.5.6. Proper kinds and quantities of equipment and supplies are essential. Mechanize and automate
procedures whenever cost-effective.
C2.5.7. Clean and properly maintained equipment works and looks better. Operators can clean most
equipment and perform many minor adjustments. Consult the equipment operator's manual or service
representative for information and instructions.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                         47


C2.5.8. Every week, look at the materials stored in the mail center to make sure they are neatly stored and
the quantity on hand is neither excessive nor inadequate for current needs. Is the mail center clean? Is all
equipment functional and needed? How long has equipment been inoperable and why?
C2.6. POSTAGE AND FEES COMPUTATION
C2.6.1. Domestic mails' postage and fees shall be computed according to the Domestic Mai1 Manual
(DMM) (reference (f)) and changes announced in the USPS Postal Bulletin. USPS Poster 123-L or 123-S
(Postal Rates and Fees) provides the information in convenient, easy-to-use form. USPS Poster 123L or
123S must be used with the Postal Zone Chart for the post office where the item will be mailed.
C2.6.1.1. (Added)(AF) Official material delivered by OMC on-base as administrative communica-
tions. Do not put U.S. postage on material not entering the USPS system. Do not apply postage on
items delivered to individuals through the postal service center (PSC).
C2.6.1.2. (Added)(AF) Do not commingle official mail stamps with USPS stamp stock and keep
official mail funds separate from stamp stock.
C2.6.2. International mails' postage and fees shall be computed according to the International Mail Man-
ual (IMM) (reference (k)) and changes announced in the USPS Postal Bulletin.
C2.6.2.1. (Added)(AF) Official Mail is subject to postage payment requirements, weight and size
limits, customs form requirements, and general conditions for mailing that otherwise apply to the
class and category of the international mail being sent (IMM). The OMC will ensure the mailing
requirement for each country is met before accepting official mail. Retain customs forms for 30
days when applicable.
C2.6.3. Electronic scales, when properly programmed, may be used to meet the requirements of para-
graphs C2.6.1. and C2.6.2.
C2.6.4. "DoD Official Intratheater Mail" shall be legibly entered in the area where the postage normally
would be placed on items mailed from one military post office (MPO) to another MPO in the same the-
ater.
C2.6.4.1. (Added)(AF) DoDOIM includes delivery between many APO AE and AP ZIP Codes.
DoDOIM mail must not enter the USPS system. Consult MAJCOM develop pouching and routing
instructions for unauthorized locations. Any agency dispatching a mass mailing of 20 or more
pieces will sort the mailing by APO ZIP Code and numerically by personal lockbox number.
DoDOIM will be treated and processed the same as if appropriated funds postage had been applied.
The rules and restrictions of paragraph C1.3 and C1.4 apply.
C2.6.5. The weight of PS Form 3811, "Domestic Return Receipt," shall not be included when calculating
the amount of postage required. See the DMM, Section S915 (reference (f)).
C2.7. POSTAGE PROCUREMENT
C2.7.1. All DoD activities shall use only prepaid postage.
C2.7.1.1. Postage shall be paid for on receipt. Do not ask postmasters or MPOs to advance postage pend-
ing receipt of funds. Any USPS or MPO employee advancing postage is personally liable for the amount
of postage advanced and may be disciplined for doing so.
48                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C2.7.1.2. Pay for all purchases by using either a credit card or an electronic funds transfer (EFT). The
chart, PAYMENT METHODS ACCEPTED BY THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE FOR COMMERCIAL
(PREPAID) POSTAGE, at Figure C2.F1. explains what may be purchased with each payment option.
C2.7.1.2.1. A Centralized Account Processing System (CAPS) or commercial meter, remotely set
(CMRS) trust account shall be used for all transactions possible.
C2.7.1.2.2. The General Service Administration (GSA) Smart Pay credit cards shall be used for all trans-
actions for which the USPS accepts them. Exception: Use the CAPS or CMRS trust account instead of a
GSA Smart Pay card when there is a choice.
C2.7.1.2.3. Trust accounts at local post offices may be used only when one of the preceding methods can-
not be used.
C2.7.1.2.4. (Added)(AF) The Air Force discontinued use of USPS penalty mail instru-
ments--stamps, meters, permit imprint mail, second-class, and reply mail. All Air Force activities
must use regular postage stamps, commercial meters, or other means available to the private sector
mailers to transact USPS business.
C2.7.1.2.5. (Added)(AF) Designated official mail clerks shall purchase official mail stamps using SF
1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other than Personal, if procuring through auto-
mated clearing house (ACH) or AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, from their local contracting
office. This form will be used to obtain cash or check to purchase stamps from the local post office.
C2.7.1.2.6. (Added)(AF) Contingency operations and exercise plans shall provide for the initial
postage requirements; follow-on procurement of additional postage; equipment, personnel, and
facilities for processing of official and internal mail; and the transportation of internal mail within
the affected area. Contingency OMCs may serve all DoD activities, regardless of their DoD compo-
nent, on a non-reimbursable basis during the deployment phase of a contingency. Upon sustain-
ment, host agencies should coordinate reimbursement procedures according to this manual.
 (Added)(AF) (Note: Official mail centers at MPOs operate using prepaid metered postage, postage
stamps, or PC-based postage. Official mail centers or supported units will not take official mail
items to military post offices to apply postage and pay with Government purchase cards to circum-
vent the requirement to use prepaid postage.)
C2.7.1.3. Deposits into trust accounts shall normally be via an overnight Automated Clearing House
(ACH) transaction. Fedwire transactions are much more expensive and shall be used only in an emer-
gency.
C2.7.1.3.1. (Added)(AF) Contingency/deployed operations must establish an official mail account
through their local contracting office or ACH disbursing agent.
C2.7.2. Electronic funds transfer (EFT) Transactions. The USPS offers both debit and credit type ACH
transactions. Currently, the Department of Defense is limited to using ACH credit transactions to trust
accounts (TA) in USPS-owned bank accounts. A separate SF 1034 (PUBLIC VOUCHER FOR PUR-
CHASES AND SERVICES OTHER THAN PERSONAL) is required for each USPS facility. A separate
SF 1034 is also required for each type of transaction. These procedures are not applicable to penalty post-
age or payments to military post offices. The required DUNNS Numbers and CAGE Codes for the appro-
priate USPS offices are listed in the CCR Registration List, United States Postal Service at Figure C2.F2.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                        49


C2.7.2.1. Deposits to the Computerized Meter Resetting System (CMRS). The SF 1034 must contain the

post office's Standard Field Account (FSA) number from the post office, pay the permit fee and postage
by following the instructions in paragraph C2.7.2.3. (NOTE: If your activity has a USPS CAPS account
and the post office has the USPS' computerized Permit System, immediately ask the CAPS Service Center
to link the permit to your CAPS account. When the CAPS account is established and linked to the permit,

her background.
C2.8.2. Secure the mail center against access by unauthorized persons. Keep it locked up whenever pos-
sible, especially when no one is on duty.
C2.8.3. Limit mail center access to mail center employees. All others must be escorted. Consider having
a sign-in sheet for persons entering and leaving the mail center, including times of arrival and departure.
C2.8.3.1. (Added)(AF) All visitors will be signed in and out of the facility using AF Form 1109, Vis-
itor Register Log.

C2.8.4. Keep accountable items separate from other items. Document each transfer of accountable items
by requiring the receiving party to sign for custody. Automate this process when cost-effective.
C2.8.5. If funds are handled as part of the mail center operation, establish adequate controls to fix indi-
vidual responsibility for any losses that may occur. Do not keep postage stamps in an unlocked drawer.
C2.8.5.1. (Added)(AF) Maintain maximum security of official mail stamp stock and funds at all
times.
C2.8.6. Keep the postage meter locked when not in use. Check outgoing metered mail at least weekly to
determine if the correct postage is being applied and only official business items receive postage.
C2.8.6.1. (Added)(AF) For contingency locations. Audit official mail account once a month and/or
during change of official mail clerks.
C2.8.7. Establish procedures to account for valuable items that were mailed, but for some reason were
returned.
C2.8.8. On parcels, place postage so it overlaps the upper right corner of the address label or tag. This is
a deterrent to theft by "overlabeling," a technique to divert the parcel to a name and address controlled by
the thief.
C2.8.9. Vary times and routes of travel between post office and mail center if currency or other valuable
mail is regularly sent or received. Check periodically to determine if mail messengers are making unau-
thorized stops or are leaving mail unattended in unlocked vehicles.
C2.8.10. Employees suspected of stealing shall be removed from duties pertaining to mail until the matter
has been investigated.
C2.8.11. Restrict dock parking to authorized vehicles.
C2.9. DEALINGS WITH THE POST OFFICE
C2.9.1. Cooperation and good relations with your post office's representatives are essential.
C2.9.1.1. Contact your post office representatives frequently. If you do not need their assistance, find
some reason to visit or call them occasionally so they will know who you are when you do need their
assistance. Do not hesitate to ask for their advice or assistance, especially when designing forms or a
large mailing. The more familiar they are with your operation the better they can help you get the most
per postal dollar.
C2.9.1.2. The postmasters and the head of postal facilities on DoD installations provide a service that is
vital to the successful accomplishment of the installations' missions and the morale and welfare of all per-
sonnel living and working on the installations. Installation commanders are encourage to invite their
postmaster and the head of the postal facility located on the installation to attend social functions and at
least once a quarter t o attend a staff meeting.
C2.9.2. Appeal disagreements with the local post office rulings or interpretations of the DMM (reference
(f))through the USPS chain of command. Forward through the DoD chain of command requests to
change USPS policy (local post offices have no authority to change USPS policy).
C2.9.2.1. (Added)(AF) Coordinate local issues with the Postmaster and customer account represen-
tative. Advise the MAJCOM OMM of unresolved or over-reaching issues. Contact local USPS Dis-
trict officials if issues cannot be resolved locally. MAJCOM OMMs contact SAF/XCIFO when
necessary for DoD and HQ USPS involvement.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                        55


C2.9.3. When asked to modernize a retail store, the local post office representatives may say they do not
have the necessary resources. The necessary resources are controlled at the USPS District level or higher.
Find out who controls the resources and then sell them on your request.
C2.9.4. USPS Delivery Policy
C2.9.4.1. There are three basic types of residential delivery: door-to-door (most expensive), curb-side,
and cluster box (least expensive).
C2.9.4.2. Postmasters are not allowed to change the type of delivery for existing residential areas without
the landowners' permission. Consider the installation commander to be the landowner. All new residen-
tial developments receive only curb-side or cluster box type delivery. NOTE: When existing buildings
are demolished and replaced with new structures the area is considered to be a new residential area. When
buildings are vacated, remodeled inside, and re-occupied the area is entitled to the same type of delivery
it had previously.
C2.9.4.3. Installation commanders shall not agree to USPS' request for changes to a lesser expensive type
of delivery without negotiating for delivery to unaccompanied personnel and business addresses.
C2.10. CONSOLIDATED MAIL REWORDED
C2.10.1. General. Consolidated mailings shall be made when they are cost-effective. Consolidated mail-
ings are a reliable way to ship administrative and operational communications and logistical items
between headquarters, depots, contractors, installations, and operational units. They remain intact while
in transit and reduce the number of times the contents are sorted. Most importantly, they reduce costs
because postage is paid on the total weight of the single consolidated container and its contents, rather
than separately on each piece within the container. Under the postage rate structure, the first one or two
pounds are the most expensive. As weight increases, the cost per pound decreases. The cost and weight
of the container and any package material must be considered in the mailing cost.
C2.10.1.1. (Added)(AF) To distribute unclassified correspondence on base, mailers use OF 65B or
C, US Government Messenger Envelopes (OF 65B, [9 1/2 X 12 inches], or 65C [12 X 16 inches]).
Addressee organization and functional address symbol (FAS) must be on every envelope. OFs 65B
or 65C may be used at OMCs between locations that receive consolidated pouches if deemed appro-
priate by the OMC. Lightweight administrative communications (four pages or less) should be
placed in letter-size envelopes.
C2.10.1.2. (Added)(AF) Use consolidated mail when you collect several items of the same class dur-
ing specified periods, (usually 1 or 2 days) that are going to the same addressee or several activities
on the same installation. You can consolidate mail in USPS 2-day priority envelopes or boxes (pre-
ferred method), larger envelopes (flats), boxes, or DoD mailbags. Select a container best suited to
hold the volume of mail you are consolidating. Place everything going into OMC for consolidation
in a container. Avoid under or overfilling containers. Do not place parcels that might damage
other mail in the consolidated container. Note the types of consolidated direct shipments:
C2.10.1.3. (Added)(AF) Administrative Pouch. A container used to transmit official correspon-
dence. Unclassified material may go in a OF 65B. You may containerize CONFIDENTIAL and
SECRET material together. List only the SECRET material on the DD Form 2825. Register con-
tainers with SECRET material. Do not use DoD or USPS pouches as outside containers to consoli-
date registered mail. Use administrative pouches when there is enough mail for one location to
justify consolidation.
56                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C2.10.1.4. (Added)(AF) Logistics Pouch. Combine high-priority supply items into one shipment
because it is cost-effective and gets better transit time. This is especially true for shipments to an
APO. In the CONUS the TMO must select the route, rate, and mode to meet user requirements at
the least overall cost.
C2.10.1.5. (Added)(AF) Weapons Pouch (WSP). WSP service is for high-priority (MICAP-999)
logistics items sent from air logistics centers to APOs. AF Form 607 or AF Form 351 identifies the
pouches as requiring high-priority handling in the MPS. The USPS does not recognize WSPs, so do
not use the tags or labels for domestic mail. Offices that receive WSPs must coordinate prompt
pickup with their servicing mail facility.
C2.10.2. Containers
C2.10.2.1. The proper selection of the container is critical to the success of consolidated mailings. See
Chapter 1 and the DMM (reference (f)) for tips on package preparation. USPS-owned Priority Mail and
Express Mail envelopes, boxes, and pouches must be used whenever possible. When USPS products are
not suitable the products listed below have been successfully used.
C2.10.2.2. Carton, 11 1/4 by 8 3/4 by 4 inches. Stock number 8115-00-861-1574.
C2.10.2.3. Carton, 12 by 10 by 8 inches. Stock number 8115-00-179-0575.
C2.10.2.4. Plastic envelopes, lightweight, heat-sealed.
C2.10.2.5. Shrink-wrap plastic.
C2.10.2.6. Sack, shipping 10 1/2 by 16 inches. Stock number 8105-00-145-0444.
C2.10.2.7. Sack, shipping 14 1/2 by 20 inches. Stock number 8105-00-145-0446.
C2.10.2.8. (Added)(AF) Letter Size Envelopes. Letter-size envelopes should not exceed one-fourth
of an inch in thickness, after stuffing and sealing them. Letter size envelopes thicker than
one-fourth of an inch are nonstandard mail pieces, and must have the word “nonmachineable”
stamped or written on the mail piece.
C2.10.2.9. (Added)(AF) Prohibitions. Do not use envelopes with clasps, staples, strings, buttons, or
similar securing devices.
C2.10.2.10. (Added)(AF) Criteria and Restrictions. These criteria and restrictions apply to enve-
lopes:
C2.10.2.10.1. (Added)(AF) Print only with black or blue ink.
C2.10.2.10.2. (Added)(AF) Do not print or stamp markings, slogans, or designs supporting an
activity or its program. This restriction also applies to mailing labels, post cards, and self-mailers.
Note: The USAF Recruiting Service may print slogans or designs on items they use in direct mail
recruiting efforts.
C2.10.2.11. (Added)(AF) Command Pouch. This is a consolidated pouch or other suitable con-
tainer to transmit administrative communications between shipping points on a scheduled basis.
You may enclose unclassified items that will go into a command pouch in OF 65B or OF 65C.
C2.10.2.11.1. (Added)(AF) Register command pouches if the outside container meets the require-
ments of the DMM.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                   57


C2.10.2.11.2. (Added)(AF) Send official administrative communications qualifying as First-Class
mail (weighing 13 ounces or more) as Priority mail.
C2.10.2.11.3. (Added)(AF) Send items generated by the Joint Uniform Military Pay System
(JUMPS) as First-Class Mail or Priority Mail.
C2.10.2.11.4. (Added)(AF) Do not send non-First-Class mail that does not require expeditious
movement in a priority pouch. Consolidate this material in a Fourth-Class pouch, if quantity war-
rants. (Exception: You may consolidate up to three pounds of non-First-Class mail with five
pounds or more of First-Class or Priority mail. In this instance, the cost for the additional three
pounds, at Priority rates, is actually less than the cost to mail the additional Third or Fourth-Class
material in a separate pouch).
C2.10.2.12. (Added)(AF) Monitoring the use of Consolidated Mail. The Chief, Electronic Commu-
nications must monitor and encourage the use of consolidated mail. To do this, he or she must:
C2.10.2.12.1. (Added)(AF) Manage the command pouch service for the installation. Establish com-
mand pouch service to activities that continually receive large quantities of mail from the installa-
tion, and advertise command pouch service.
C2.10.2.12.1. (AETC) The OMM establishes pouch locations and frequency of dispatch, and informs the
ADO.
C2.10.2.12.2. (Added)(AF) Coordinate the establishment of command pouch service with receiving
installations, and monitor and exchange transit time information.
C2.10.2.12.3. (Added)(AF) Ensure consolidated mail is prepared properly, has correct amount of
postage, and the correct address.
C2.10.2.12.4. (Added)(AF) Report any irregularities in the receipt or dispatch of consolidated mail
to the sender.
C2.10.2.12.5. (Added)(AF) Ensure addressing of single unconsolidated containers shows the mail
going directly to the recipient and not to the receiving OMC. Activity distribution and action
offices must also know this requirement.
C2.10.2.13. (Added)(AF) Addressing Pouches and Paying Postage:
C2.10.2.13.1. (Added)(AF) Use AF Form 232, Pouch Mailing Tag, to address pouches and affix
postage to large Air Force-owned pouches. You may overprint or rubber stamp the return and
delivery addresses on the AF Form 232. After closure, weigh the pouch, compute the postage, and
affix the postage meter tape to the AF Form 232. The receiving activity can use the postmark date
on the AF Form 232 to determine transit times.
C2.10.2.13. (Added)(AF) Frequency of Dispatch. MAJCOM or installation OMMs establish their
own dispatch schedule for consolidated mail, based on user requirements, normal transit times, and
mail volumes. Make pouch dispatch days, close out times, and transit times known to activity dis-
tribution offices. Exceptions may be made for urgent mailings that must go on days when a direct
pouch isn’t scheduled for a particular location. However, remind mailers that pouch mail usually
receives better transit times than individual pieces of mail. Therefore, an item sent outside the
pouch may not save time.

C2.10.2.13. (AETC) HQ AETC/A6OC does not operate a mail distribution center. Consolidated mail for
HQ AETC staff should be enclosed in the consolidation for 12 CS/SCQAC, 355 B Street West, Suite 1,
Randolph AFB TX 78150-4522.
C2.10.2.13.1. (Added)(AF) Expediting Command Pouches. Command pouches can be taken to the
servicing USPS Airport Mail Facility to expedite onward movement. Coordinate this with the ser-
vicing USPS representative.
C2.10.3. Preparation
C2.10.3.1. Package consolidated mail shipments as required by the DMM (reference (f)) for the appropri-
ate class of mail and applicable special services such as registered.
C2.10.3.2. Address Labels. Use USPS Label 228C on Priority Mail consolidated mail shipments. The
USPS provides these labels with the to and from address already printed. They are free and can be
obtained by calling the USPS at 1-800-610-7833 to set up a customer account. A similar label is available
for repetitive Express Mail shipments.
C2.10.3.2.1. (Added)(AF) AF Form 232 may also be used on consolidated mail shipments. Place
postage label on the front of the tag, if possible, to avoid item being returned for postage.
C2.10.3.3. Non-First-Class Mail may be combined with First-Class Mail only when cost-effective.
C2.10.3.4. Large paper envelopes or cartons may have the address and postage placed on the container or
on an address label. If a label is used, the postage meter tape or postage stamps shall overlap the upper
right edge of the label. Consolidated Mail or CM shall be placed immediately below the return address.
These containers are to be opened and sorted in the addressee's official mail center.
C2.10.3.5. Two or more parcels may be fastened together and mailed as one piece. See the DMM
C600.1.2. (reference (f)) for information.
C2.10.4. Special Services
C2.10.4.1. When an item requiring a special service such as registered, certified, numbered insured, or
Return Receipt for Merchandise is placed in a consolidated mailing the whole mailing shall be registered,
certified, numbered insured, or be Return Receipt of Merchandise as appropriate. The appropriate PS
Form 200-A, 3800, 3813-P, or 3811 must be placed only on the outside of the consolidated mailing. Rea-
son: The addressee signs for only the PS Form pertaining to the consolidated container, not those on indi-
vidual items in it. Therefore, USPS can not trace those on the individual items. The dispatching mail
center shall prepare and include DD Form 2825 (see Figure C1.F2.) in these shipments.
C2.10.4.2. Items requiring registered service shall not be placed in certified or numbered insured consol-
idated mailings because they are not signed for each time they change hands. However, certified or num-
bered insured items may be placed in a registered consolidated mailing when cost-effective.
C2.10.4.3. Items requiring certified service shall not be placed in numbered insured consolidated mail-
ings. These items may contain classified material and numbered insured is not sealed against inspection.
C2.10.4.4. When items with PS Form 3811 attached are placed in a consolidated mailing, the PS Forms
3811 attached to the individual pieces shall be removed and destroyed or returned to the sender. When an
official mail center receives a consolidated mailing containing items bearing PS Form 3811, the official
mail center shall remove and destroy the PS Forms 3811 attached to the individual pieces. REASON: A
fee must be paid for each PS Form 3811. Those fees are not paid when the items are consolidated.

C2.10.5. Dispatch. The OMM shall establish and publish the dispatch schedule for consolidated mail-
ings. It shall be based on user requirements, normal transit times, the recipient's normal business days,
and mail volumes. Schedule dispatches so the consolidated mail would normally be delivered on days
when the addressee is usually open for business. For example, the normal transit time between A and B
is 3 days. Consolidated mail dispatched on Wednesday and Thursday would normally be available for
delivery on Saturday and Sunday, days the addressee is usually closed. It would actually be delivered on
Monday. These items would still be delivered on Monday if held and dispatched on Friday. And, the cost
per pound may be less because the consolidated mail shipment may contain additional items and be
heavier. Consolidated mail shipments may be made any time the shipment equals the maximum allow-
able weight or size for a single mail piece.
C2.10.5.1. (Added)(AF) Normally, consolidated mail goes to the host base activity OMC serving the
installation. Addresses for occasional administrative or logistics pouches are in the Air Force
Address Directory at https://private.afca.af.mil/afdir/. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and similar activities
that receive large quantities of mail may want a separate pouch sent directly to them; coordinate
this with the installation or agency OMM. Address consolidated mail as follows:
Official Mail Center
(Street Address)
(Base) (State) (ZIP + 4)
(Number) ABG/SCBA
(Street Address)
(Base) (State) (ZIP + 4)
C.2.10.5.2. (Added)(AF) OMCs will dispatch command pouches daily.
C2.10.6. Monitoring. The installation or equivalent OMM shall monitor and encourage the use of con-
solidated mail. To do this the OMM shall:
C2.10.6.1. Manage the consolidated mail service for the entire installation or equivalent.
C2.10.6.2. Establish consolidated mail service to activities that continually receive large quantities of
mail from the installation and advertise the service.
C2.10.6.3. Coordinate the establishment of consolidated mail service with receiving installations/activi-
ties and monitor and exchange transit time information.
C2.10.6.4. Make sure consolidated mail is properly prepared, has the correct amount of postage, has the
correct address, and contains only items the addressee can deliver.
C2.10.6.5. Report to the sender any irregularities in the preparation or receipt of consolidated mail. Also,
the sending OMM shall take action to prevent the irregularities in the future.
C2.11. POSTAGE METERS
C2.11.1. Only commercial meters, remotely set (CMRS) shall be leased by DoD activities.
C2.11.1.1. (Added)(AF) Postage meters cannot be owned; they must be leased. Unless otherwise
specified in a host-tenant agreement, the installation OMM budgets for the lease of official postage
meters for the installation. Mailing machines are Air Force-owned equipment listed on a unit’s
supply account. Owning activities must budget for maintenance and replacement of mailing
machines, as well as scales and related supporting equipment.

C2.11.2. License
C2.11.2.1. (Added)(AF) The OMM is responsible for meters and associated equipment used to pre-
pare official mail for dispatch. The Air Force owns all associated equipment, which must be on the
activity’s supply account.
C2.11.2.1. Postage meter licenses are required and are obtained by submitting PS Form 3601-A, "Appli-
cation or Update for a License to Lease and Use Postage Meters," per instructions in the DMM P030.2
(reference (f)). The DMM, P030.2.6 (reference (f)), contains responsibilities of the license holder.
NOTE: Applicants planning to use a commercial postage meter at an MPO shall follow the instructions
contained in the AGREEMENT CONCERNING COMMERCIAL POSTAGE METER USE AT MILI-
TARY POST OFFICE ADDRESSES at Appendix 1. Contact the MPO if further assistance is needed.
C2.11.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) Meter License. The manufacturer should not release the meter until a
license is actually obtained from the local post office. The license cannot be transferred to a meter
registered at another post office; however, the same license may be used when a meter is removed
from operation and replaced with another at the same location. It doesn’t matter if the meters
come from two different manufacturers. The model number of the new meter and mailing machine
must be marked on the license. When a meter is removed from service and not replaced, cancel the
license with the local post office.
C2.11.2.2. Licenses shall be canceled when no longer needed.
C2.11.2.3. Notify the licensing post office whenever the name, address, or telephone number on a PS
Form 3601-A changes.
C2.11.3. Setting, Payments, and Refunds
C2.11.3.1. Meters shall be immediately checked in service upon receipt and out of service when defec-
tive, no longer needed, or the licensee moves to a different post office. (NOTE: All AE and AA MPOs
are branches of the New York City Post Office and all AP MPOs are branches of the San Francisco Post
Office.) See the DMM, section P030.2.8 (reference (f)) and Appendix 1 for instructions. Establish pro-
cedures to make sure refunds are received and properly accounted for on postage remaining on defective
or no longer needed meters when they are checked out of service. (NOTE: Under certain conditions, the
post office is unable to determine how much money is left on a defective meter when it is checked out of
service. In this case, a refund is made after the meter is inspected at the manufacturer's facility.)
C2.11.3.1.1. (Added)(AF) Contact your MAJCOM official mail manager for current guidance
prior to returning meters. Coordinate the return with the vendor and your local resource advisor
to determine the correct format for refund checks from vendors to ensure refunds are returned to
applicable base funds, if appropriate.
C2.11.3.2. Each meter shall be reset each quarter for the estimated amount of postage to be used on that
meter during the quarter. Reset the meter for a zero amount of postage if additional postage is not needed.
When commercial meters, remotely set, are set at least every 90 days they need not be taken to the post
office for physical inspection. Backup meters should have only the minimum amount of postage needed
to prevent work stoppages.
C2.11.3.2.1. (Added)(AF) The Custodian of Postal Effects (COPE) or OMM will be responsible for
setting meters. Additionally a folder should be maintained for each individual meter head contain-
ing PS Form 3601-A; PS Form 3602-A, Daily Record of Meter Register Readings (or spreadsheet
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                      61


with the same information); and PS Form 3610, Record of Postage Meter Settings, a log showing
monthly verification of the TA and other applicable information for that meter.
C2.11.3.3. When a meter is set or reset, the OMM shall verify the meter was actually set for the desired
amount of postage.
C2.11.3.3.1. (Added)(AF) Meter Setting and Accounting System:
C2.11.3.3.2. (Added)(AF) Only a USPS representative can reset a meter.
C2.11.3.3.3. (Added)(AF) At overseas locations, the APO chief is the representative of the USPS.
The APO Chief, Official Mail Manager (or COPE), will perform functions for official mail postage
meters in accordance with the USPS DMM, Section 144 and the DoD Postal Manual.
C2.11.3.3.4. (Added)(AF) When setting the meter, the USPS representative prepares a PS Form
3603 in triplicate. The USPS keeps two copies of the PS Form 3603 and gives the meter holder the
original for file. This form shows meter and license numbers, identifies the installation and unit
using the meter, and the ascending and descending register readings shown on the meter before and
after setting the meter. The USPS representative and the meter holder must verify these entries.
C2.11.3.3.5. (Added)(AF) The USPS keeps a PS Form 3610 for each official postage meter licensed
at the post office.
C2.11.3.3.6. (Added)(AF) When withdrawing a meter from service, the responsible Air Force activ-
ity must ensure the servicing USPS facility provides proper credit for postage remaining on the
descending register. Transfer postage to a replacement meter only when the license is also being
transferred. Coordinate with your local resource advisor to determine the correct format for
refund checks to ensure refunds are returned to applicable base funds.
C2.11.3.4. (Added)(AF) Accounting Responsibilities:
C2.11.3.4.1. (Added)(AF) Postal Flight Commanders, Postmasters and Official Mail Managers
overseas are responsible for mailing machines, meters, and associated equipment used in preparing
official mail for dispatch. The Air Force owns or leases associated equipment and all owned equip-
ment must be on the information management or using activity’s supply account. The Allowance
Standard (AS) 006ABOO authorizes mailing machines and metering equipment. Additional offi-
cial mail center equipment can be found in AS 006AAOO, Organizational Equipment (Multipurpose
– Used In More Than One Functional Area), & 006EOOO.
C2.11.3.4.2. (Added)(AF) Individuals operating metering equipment must provide proper care and
protection for the equipment. To do this, a meter operator must:
C2.11.3.4.2.1. (Added)(AF) Allow no one except USPS or MPO officials to break the seal placed on
a postage meter. Breaking or tampering with this seal is a postal offense.
C2.11.3.4.2.2. (Added)(AF) Ensure the machine is locked and the key is removed whenever the
meter is not under surveillance by an authorized operator.
C2.11.3.4.2.3. (Added)(AF) Ensure unauthorized personnel do not use the metering equipment and
the equipment only processes official mail.
C2.11.3.4.2.4. (Added)(AF) Keep areas under the equipment free of dirt and filth, and check for
mail that may have slipped underneath.
C2.11.4. Daily Record of Meter Register Readings

C2.11.4a. (Added)(AF) USPS or MPO officials will provide a PS Form 3602-A booklet at the first
meter setting and replace it when it is full. Dispose of it according to the AFRIMS RDS, available
at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds_series.cfm.
C2.11.4b. (Added) (AF) PS Form 3602-A is obsolete, but may be used until supplies are exhausted.
C2.11.4.1. PS Form 3602-A, "Daily Record of Meter Register Readings," shall be maintained for each
meter. Licensees using metering systems that record these readings electronically may use system-gener-
ated printed records of the preceding 12 months of meter activity as a substitute for manual entry of daily
ascending and descending readings on Form 3602-A. See the DMM P030.2.6 (reference (f)).
C2.11.4.1.1. (Added)(AF) PS Form 3602-A is obsolete, but may be used until supplies are
exhausted. In lieu of the form, use a spreadsheet to record the same information. This information
is essential for obtaining proper refunds if the meter breaks and the amount of postage remaining
cannot be determined from the meter.
C2.11.4.2. When the meter is set, or reset, add the amounts appearing in the ascending and descending
registers before the meter is used. The resulting sum becomes a control number. At the close of business
each day these two registers shall be added together. If their sum is not the same as the control number,
the meter may have malfunctioned. The serving vendor shall be contacted before the meter is used again.
C2.11.4.2.1. (Added)(AF) OMCs must coordinate with the Base Commander on projected base clo-
sures to ensure proper account increases or decreases.
C2.11.4.3. To determine the amount of postage used on any given day, subtract the descending register
reading for the day from the descending register reading for the previous day.
C2.11.4.4. The post office keeps a PS Form 3610, "Record of Postage, Meter Setting," for each postage
meter licensed at the post office. The post office records the amount of the postage added to the meter on
this form. Even though PS Form 3610 is for internal USPS use the license holders may review them.
NOTE: PS Form 3610 will not show settings on remotely set meters.
C2.11.4.4.1. (Added)(AF) Maintain copies of PS Form 3610 with individual meter files.
C2.11.5. Spoiled or Incorrect Meter Postage
C2.11.5.1. Requests for refunds shall be submitted when authorized. DMM, section P014.3 (reference
(f)) explains the conditions and procedures to be followed.
C2.11.5.1.1. (Added)(AF) Coordinate with your local resource advisor to determine the correct for-
mat for refund checks to ensure refunds are returned to applicable base funds.
C2.11.5.2. Equipment malfunctions causing spoiled meter postage shall be immediately reported to the
manufacturers representative.
C2.11.5.3. OMMs shall ensure that spoiled meter postage is minimal and properly accounted for.
C2.11.5.3.1. (Added)(AF) Do not trace over or otherwise attempt to correct meter imprints (post-
age cost, meter number, APO, or date).
C2.11.6. Metered Mail Preparation
C2.11.6.1. The meter imprint acts as a postmark and allows mail to skip the canceling process so be sure
it is bright and clear, has the correct date, and florescent ink is used.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                          63


C2.11.6.2. All addresses must face the same way, and five or more pieces of metered mail must be bun-
dled with rubber bands or paper straps. Large volumes of metered mail shall be placed in the appropriate
size tray or flat container. Trays and similar items are usually provided free of charge by USPS and shall
not be used for other purposes.
C2.11.7. Postage Management Systems (when available)
C2.11.7.1. Postage management systems are a useful tool for managing metered postage and for charging
the postage back to the user. They record various types of data about metered mail such as the amount of
postage, date, mail class, and mail volume by user, function, or task.
C2.11.7.1. When postage management systems are not available, OMCs should develop spreadsheets
locally to track mail costs by users for reimbursement.
C2.11.7.1.1. (Added)(AF) OMCs must track official mail expenditures for all contingency/deployed
units to provide calculated cost figures to their finance office or resource advisor to initiate reim-
bursement actions. Submit expenditure status once a month or as needed.
C2.11.7.2. The record of postage used shall be analyzed by the OMM at regular intervals (weekly for
most installations and activities). Information in the analysis shall be used to identify large volume mail-
ers and users of large amounts of certain classes of mail or special postal services. Their mailings shall be
periodically analyzed to see if the items can be shipped more economically by other means.
C2.11.7.2.1. (Added)(AF) The OMM large volume mailers should be referred to paragraph C1.5.
to assist in eliminating unnecessary mailings.
C2.11.8. Meter Security
C2.11.8.1. Meters
C2.11.8.1.1. Remove the meter and place it in a locked safe, file cabinet, or in a locked room overnight
and any other time the operator is temporarily absent and adequate surveillance cannot be maintained to
prevent unauthorized use of the meter. Exceptions: Meters requiring a code or password for operation
need not be removed during temporary absences of the operator. Meters that lock in place on mailing
machines need not be removed from the mailing machine at night as long as the mailing machine is in a
secured area.
C2.11.8.1.1.1. (Added)(AF) Meters that lock in-place on mailing machines must be locked and the
key removed and secured.
C2.11.8.1.2. Immediately report the loss, theft, and recovery of a lost or stolen meter to the local post
office, the equipment vender, and through command channels to DoD Official Mail Manager, Military
Postal Service Agency, 2461 Eisenhower Ave, STE 812, Alexandria, VA 22331-0006 or
DoDomm@hqda.army.mil. Reports shall include the meter make, model, and serial number; the date,
location, and details of the loss, theft, or recovery; and a copy of the police report when applicable.
C2.11.8.2. Meter Keys and Combinations
C2.11.8.2.1. The Department of Defense (except MPOs) is not authorized to have a copy of the key or
any other device or code necessary to open and/or reset the meter. Any activity receiving such keys or
devices shall immediately give them to the post office responsible for the meter.
C2.11.8.2.2. The OMCM shall:
64                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C2.11.8.2.2.1. Turn over these duties to the OMM or assistant official mail manager (AOMM) when the
OMCM is absent or is a meter operator.
C2.11.8.2.2.2. Keep extra keys and current meter combinations Modified in secure envelopes. The
meter operator and the OMCM shall sign on the seal of the envelopes to validate the security of the keys/
combinations. The envelopes shall be stored in a secure, locked receptacle. The OMM or AOMM shall
sign the envelopes when the meter operator and the OMCM is the same person.
C2.11.8.2.2.2. Extra keys and current meter combination envelopes will be receipted for and stored by
the OMM, postmaster or COPE in a secure locked container or drawer.
C2.11.8.2.2.3. Maintain a meter key/combination log to account for all keys and or combinations on
hand, in use, or issued, and who has each key or combination. It shall show the dates an operator received
the key or combination and the date the key was returned or the combination was changed.
C2.11.8.2.2.4. Limit the number of people having a key or combination to those who have need to use
them.
C2.11.8.2.2.5. Change the meter's combination or obtain meter keys from a meter operator when the
meter operator permanently stops being a meter operator or when the meter operator will be temporarily
absent 1 week or longer.
C2.12. POSTAGE STAMPS AND PC POSTAGE
C2.12.1. Who May Use. Postage stamps and PC Postage are intended for use by small volume mailers
throughout the Department of Defense with outgoing mail volume too low to justify postage meters and
for special projects such as "Black Box Payments." Activities without a backup metering system may
maintain no more than a 10-day emergency supply of postage stamps or PC Postage to be used only when
metering equipment is not operational. Postage stamps and PC Postage shall be centralized and closely
controlled by the activity OMM. The advantages of permit and consolidated mailings must be main-
tained.
C2.12.1.1. (Added)(AF) Those locations using less than $2,000 per quarter should use postage
stamps for official mailings. Any location may use PC Postage; however, there are monthly costs
associated. The location is responsible for procurement, budgeting and payment of associated
costs.
C2.12.1.1.1. (Added)(AF) Deployed locations should not maintain more than a 90-day stamp stock.
Initial procurement should not exceed $500 depending on projected use, size of contingency opera-
tion, and amount of units served.
C2.12.2. Purchasing. Only deployable units, activities without a backup metering system and those small
volume mailers that have been authorized by their installation may purchase postage stamps or PC post-
age. OMMs shall verify quantities of postage received. Prepaid postage stamps may be purchased from
the local post office, by mail through the Stamps By Mail program or through the Stamps By Phone pro-
gram. Contact your USPS account representative or Postal Business Center for details. (NOTE: PC post-
age may be used only when payment for postage is made directly to the USPS and not to a vendor who
then pays the USPS.)
C2.12.2.1. (Added)(AF) The commander must approve the purchase of host nation stamps. The
OMC will establish control procedures for requisitioning, issuing, controlling, auditing and inven-
torying the host nation postage. Specific locations (e.g., Germany) are not authorized to purchase
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                         65


host nation postage with operations and maintenance funds to send official First-Class mail to loca-
tions throughout the country.
C2.12.2.2. (Added)(AF) Air Force activities may not purchase penalty mail stamps or envelopes.
Postage stamps must be purchased at local USPS post offices or MPOs using cash or check.
C2.12.3. Postage Stamp Security. All personnel are responsible for preventing the theft, misuse, waste,
or loss of postage stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal cards. The inventory shall be centralized and
closely controlled by the activity OMM. It shall be secured in locked containers (safes, file cabinets, desk
drawers, etc.) or a locked room.
C2.13. EMERGENCY DISPOSITION OF POSTAGE STAMPS, METERS, AND PC POSTAGE
DEVICES
C2.13.1. If conditions permit, follow normal procedures for checking a meter out of service and returning
the meter to USPS, or the MPO, or the manufacturer (as appropriate).
C2.13.2. If capture or loss of meters or PC Postage devices is imminent, record make, model, and serial
number and destroy them if possible. Report destruction, capture, or loss per the instructions in paragraph
C2.11.8.1.2. of this Manual.
C2.13.3. When use of postage stamps is no longer possible, transfer existing inventory to another location
for safe keeping or use. Destroy postage stamps when capture is imminent.
C2.13.3.1. (Added)(AF) Contingency/deployed units must coordinate with the MAJCOM OMM
for disposition of official mail accounts, residual stamp stock, and funds.
C2.14. POSTAGE DUE PENALTY MAIL
Postage Due Penalty Mail was created by the USPS so DoD activities engaged in hostile operations or
operating under arduous conditions can send official matter through the USPS when postage is not avail-
able. The postage is collected from the addressee.
C2.14a. (Added)(AF) Postage due penalty mail may be used by military units engaged in hostile
operations during the first 30-days of hostilities. Such use must be according to section 137.5 of the
USPS DMM and DoD 4525.8-M. Postage due penalty mail will be paid by the addressee upon
receipt. Payment for postage due penalty mail may be made by cash, check, stamps, or meter
strips. Postage due penalty mail used by military units engaged in hostile operations will not be
refused by the addressee.
C2.14.1. Postage Due Penalty Mail shall be prepared per the DMM E0605.7 (reference (f)).
C2.14.2. The lack of adequate funding is not a valid reason for its use.
C2.14.3. Postage due penalty mail SHALL NOT BE USED to notify next of kin of casualties, to send
items to addressees outside the Department of Defense, or to international mail addresses.
C2.14.4. DoD addressees shall pay the postage due when the item is delivered. Only postage stamps,
postage meter strips, or cash are acceptable.
C2.14.5. Theater Commanders-in-Chief may authorize some or all DoD activities in the theater to use
Postage Due Penalty Mail for periods not exceeding 120 days. Theater Commanders-in-Chief shall notify
the DoD Official Mail Manager that Postage Due Penalty Mail is being used not later than the second
business day after use begins. The DoD Official Mail Manager shall notify the USPS General Manager,
66                                 DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


Official and International Mail Accounting Division, not later than the third business day after use begins.
The policies listed below apply:
C2.14.5.1. The "DoD Official Intra-theater Mail" procedures outlined in paragraph C1.16.5. continue to
apply to mail remaining in the same overseas theater. It also applies between adjacent theaters (e.g.,
United States European Command (EUCOM) and United States Central Command (CENTCOM)) where
there is no chance the mail will transit the United States Postal Service domestic system.
C2.14.5.2. For all other mail leaving the theater, continue using postage stamps, PC postage, and postage
meters as long as possible before switching to the Postage Due Penalty Mail procedures outlined below.
C2.14.5.2.1. Postage stamps shall be used when official mail centers can no longer use postage meters
due to a lack of electricity or equipment failures, or when postal personnel are no longer available to set
the meters. (When MPO financial transactions are terminated, postage meters must be checked out of
use.)
C2.14.5.2.2. Postage Due Penalty Mail shall be used on mail leaving the theater when postage stamps are
not available or cannot be used.
C2.14.5.3. As the situation stabilizes, postage stamps shall replace Postage Due Penalty Mail as soon as
possible. The use of postage meters may be resumed as soon as electricity, serviceable equipment, and
MPO personnel to process the meters are available.
C2.14.5.4. In the following scenario, M-Day is the day the theater commander-in-chief authorizes the use
of postage due penalty mail.
C2.14.5.4.1. At M-Day: Switch to Postage Due Penalty Mail where continued use of postage stamps, PC
postage, or postage meters is not practical.
C2.14.5.4.2. At M+30: Users of Postage Due Penalty Mail switch to postage stamps or PC postage and/
or postage meters (where practical).
C2.14.5.4.3. At M+60: Those still using Postage Due Penalty Mail introduce postage stamps or make
plans to have postage applied to their mail elsewhere in the theater. If these are not practical, continue use
of Postage Due Penalty Mail.
C2.14.5.4.4. At M+90: Those still using Postage Due Penalty Mail convert to postage stamps or PC post-
age and/or postage meters or have postage applied to their mail elsewhere in the theater. If these are not
practical, continue use of Postage Due Penalty Mail.
C2.14.5.4.5. At M+120: Postage stamps, PC postage and/or postage meters replace all use of Postage
Due Penalty Mail. If that is not possible, advise the DoD Official Mail Manager why it is not possible and
provide an estimate as to when replacement of Postage Due Penalty Mail will be feasible. The DoD Offi-
cial Mail Manager will then notify the USPS.
C2.15. CHANGE OF ADDRESS
DoD activities shall submit PS Form 3575, "Change of Address Order," when they move. See Chapter 6
for instructions pertaining to unit activations and deactivations.
C2.16. CONTRACTING-OUT
A contractor, with one exception, may legally perform Official mail center operations. Contractors can
not legally carry internal mail qualifying as a "letter" over "post roads" unless such mail bears postage or
meets the requirements for one or more of the exemptions to the Private Express Statues. All public
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                       67


streets and highways are considered to be "post roads." See "Private Express Statutes" in the DL1.1.41.
for a list of applicable statues and the suspensions thereto.
C2.17. PERSONAL AND SOLICITATION MAIL
C2.17.1. Personal Mail. An activity's employees shall not receive personal mail or send outgoing per-
sonal mail through an official mail center. Mail bearing an attention line or the addressee's name with a
job title is considered to be official and shall be delivered. The three following exceptions apply.
C2.17.1.1. All mail bearing an official Federal Government return address shall be delivered.
C2.17.1.2. Employees may receive personal mail through the official mail center only during the first 120
days after they join the organization. This is to allow time to establish a local residence address.
C2.17.1.3. Discretion should be used in applying this policy to individuals who regularly deal with those
outside of the Department of Defense. It is common practice outside of the Department of Defense to
address official business matters to an individual by name and the address may or may not include a job
title or attention line.
C2.17.2. Solicitation mail is mail (from non-Government sources) addressed to many individuals by
name for the purpose of obtaining business, information, or donations. Undeliverable-as-addressed solic-
itation mail shall be marked "Undeliverable as Addressed" and returned to the post office. Do not attempt
to provide a forwarding address.
C2.18. MAIL CENTER EQUIPMENT
C2.18.1. Account for all equipment on the property records of the using DoD Component. The postage
meter, itself, is leased and cannot be purchased.
C2.18.1.1. (Added)(AF) OMCs are not authorized to use USPS meter equipment. Acquire meter
equipment through private vendors.
C2.18.2. Equipment Operation
C2.18.2.1. The OMM and all personnel involved in mail processing should receive detailed instructions
from the vendor when new equipment is installed. During initial use, do not hesitate to call the service
representative when questions arise.
C2.18.2.2. Check each scale for accuracy daily before it is used. This shall be accomplished by weighing
an object of known weight. Appropriate calibrations shall be made before the scale is used.
C2.18.2.2.1. (Added)(AF) Ensure either a Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory or a des-
ignated contractor calibrates mechanical or electronic postal scales on site at frequencies specified
in the manufacturer’s instruction booklet. Consider recalibration if scales are physically relocated
within your facility.
C2.18.2.3. Check each system immediately after updating postage rates to ensure the updated system cor-
rectly computes all postage. This can be accomplished by comparing the system's output to the rates
printed in the DMM Module R (reference (f)).
C2.18.3. Equipment Failure
C2.18.3.1. Do not tamper with the postage meter under any circumstances. It is a postal offense for any-
one other than USPS personnel to break or tamper with the seals on postage meters.

C2.18.3.2. Immediately report failures of meters, mailing machines, scales, etc., to the service represen-
tative. The service representatives' telephone numbers shall be prominently displayed in the vicinity of
that equipment.
C2.18.4. Equipment Maintenance
C2.18.4.1. All new equipment is initially covered by a warranty. Maintenance contracts shall be used
after the warranty expires.
C2.18.4.1.1. (Added)(AF) Manage this with annual service contracts or by separate service calls
after the expiration of any warranty period. Users must establish and maintain service contracts.
When a malfunction occurs in a meter register or a mailing machine, immediately request service
from the nearest manufacturer’s representative. Under no circumstances will OMC staff tamper
with a meter. Only the meter manufacturer may perform meter register maintenance.
C2.18.4.2. A maintenance log shall be maintained for each piece of equipment in the mail center. The log
shall show the date the equipment was initially placed in use and its cost. It shall also show: the date the
equipment stopped working properly, the nature of the malfunction, the date and time repairs were
requested, the date and time the repair person first arrived, the date and time the repair was completed, a
summary of what was done, the cost of the repair, and how long the equipment was out of operation.
This information is useful in determining when equipment should be replaced, the quality of repair ser-
vice, and equipment reliability.
C2.18.4.2.1. (Added)(AF) Equipment Failure (Mailing Machine Maintenance). Handle this with
annual service contracts or by separate service calls after the expiration of any warranty period.
Users must establish and maintain service contracts. When a malfunction occurs in a meter regis-
ter or a mailing machine, immediately request service from the nearest manufacturer’s representa-
tive. Under no circumstances will anyone tamper with the meter. Only the meter manufacturer
may do maintenance to the meter register.
C2.18.4.2.2. (Added)(AF) Equipment Placement. The base OMM may relocate existing equipment
to a new activity on the same base or to another base to obtain proper use and improve mail pro-
cessing. Besides the OMC, the OMM can assign metering equipment to any activity that generates
large volumes and that has personnel to operate the equipment. However, any time a meter is
assigned to another activity it must be checked out of service at the post office serving the transfer-
ring activity and checked into service at the post office of the gaining activity. This must be accom-
plished even if the same post office serves both activities. Do not relocate any meter without prior
approval of the base OMM. For tenant units, responsibilities for postal support should be in
host-tenant support agreements. In placing equipment, consider:
C2.18.4.2.2.1. (Added)(AF) Mail volume.
C2.18.4.2.2.2. (Added)(AF) Personnel available to assume the function.
C2.18.4.2.2.3. (Added)(AF) Unique operational requirements; e.g., mailing needs after duty hours
and on weekends.
C2.18.4.2.2.4. (Added)(AF) If the assignment of a meter will expedite the dispatch of mail.
C2.18.4.2.2.5. (Added)(AF) Impact on the consolidated mail program.

C2.18.4.3. (Added)(AF) Excess Postal Equipment. MAJCOMs will establish controls for the iden-
tification, redistribution, or turn-in of excess postal equipment. If excess equipment cannot be
used, ask another MAJCOM if they have a need for it.
C2.18.4.3. (AETC) Identify excess postal equipment to HQ AETC/A6OC. Include type, manufacturer,
model number, age, and condition.

                                             C3. CHAPTER 3
                                               ADDRESSES
C3.1. GENERAL
This Chapter sets forth the policies and procedures for the assignment, format, printing, verifying, and use
of addresses within the Department of Defense.
C3.2. ADDRESS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AMS)
C3.2.1. United States Postal Services' (USPS') AMS Database. The USPS' AMS database contains all
deliverable addresses. It is the basis for all bar-coding and automated mail processing. Street addresses
with the secondary designators (when applicable) must be included in the AMS database.
C3.2.2. USPS' AMS Offices:
C3.2.2.1. Enter city names, street addresses and secondary unit designators into the AMS database. They
also assign ZIP+4 Codes and process requests for additional 5-digit ZIP Codes. (NOTE: The only time
more than one 5-digit ZIP Code is need on a DoD installation is if more than 9,999 +4 Codes are needed.
When this happens, the USPS will automatically assign an additional ZIP Code, if one is available.)
C3.2.2.2. Are responsible for addresses in a particular area. The address and telephone number for the
AMS office for a particular location can be found via the USPS' Home Page. The address is "http://
www.usps.com/." Click on LOCATE. Follow the directions when a new screen appears.
C3.3. ASSIGNMENT OF ADDRESSES
All DoD addresses, not just official mail addresses, shall be assigned so they are compatible with the
USPS' automated delivery point sequencing.
C3.3.1. Military post office (MPO) addresses shall include the unit, postal service center (PSC), or con-
solidated mail room (CMR) address and secondary unit designator, as appropriate.
C3.3.1.1. (Added)(AF) ADOs are not required to endorse class of service for flats or parcels
addressed to intra-theater or CONUS pouch locations.
C3.3.2. In areas served by the USPS:
C3.3.2.1. The DoD Installations' names shall be included as city or community names in the AMS data-
base. (NOTE: If the AMS Office is reluctant to include installation names, refer them to Domestic Mail
Manual A010.6.3 (reference (f)).) (It states the installation's name must appear in the address.) If the
installation shares a ZIP Code with a civilian community, the AMS Office can code the street addresses
on the installation so the preferred city or community name for those addresses is the installation's name,
not the civilian community's name.)
C3.3.2.2. The DoD installation is responsible for assigning city-style, street addresses on the installation.
Contact the local city planning or zoning office if assistance is needed. Some engineering firms also do
this type of work.
C3.3.2.2.1. Street addresses shall be assigned and used even though a DoD activity may deliver the mail
to the addressee.
C3.3.2.2.2. The sorting and delivery of all mail, including internal, shall be based on the street address
and secondary unit designator, and the city, State, ZIP+4 Code.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                            79


C3.3.2.2.3. Street addresses assigned by the Department of Defense shall not duplicate addresses found
in adjacent civilian communities. The responsible AMS Office will know if the proposed DoD addresses
duplicate non-DoD addresses. Once the name of a street has been entered into the AMS database and is
being used as a mail address it shall not be changed because it creates unnecessary changes of address.
C3.3.2.2.4. Only geographically locatable civilian-style street address (such as 1234 Telles Avenue) shall
be used. EXCEPTION: U.S. Marine Corps deploying units may use either post office box addresses or a
street style address. Prior to use, such addresses shall be coordinated with the installation's postal officer,
the serving postmaster and AMS office.
C3.3.2.2.5. DoD installations shall not use one street address for the entire installation and then use sec-
ondary unit designators such as "Building 123" to designate the delivery addresses on the installation.
Doing so precludes the automated sorting of mail to more than one destination in a building.
C3.3.2.2.6. Addresses such as "Building 123 Roberts Street" are not a valid address format and shall not
be used.
C3.3.2.2.7. The acronyms PSC and CMR shall be used only in MPO addresses.
C3.3.2.3. Address Placement
C3.3.2.3.1. Place addresses by the front entrance of the building so they can be seen from the street.
C3.3.2.3.2. Place both the street name and address number on the building if both the building number
and the street address number are visible from the street. This same type of sign shall be used on build-
ings placed diagonally on street corners and on buildings set back from the street so far it is not obvious
to which street they belong.
C3.3.2.4. Secondary unit designators, such as suite, room, unit, or stop, etc., followed by a number, shall
be used when there is more than one activity, office, or mail receptacle at the same street address.
C3.3.2.4.1. Secondary unit designators shall refer only to locations, activities, or mail receptacles physi-
cally located at the street address with which they are used.
C3.3.2.4.2. Secondary unit designators shall be assigned as follows:
C3.3.2.4.2.1. Use only the secondary unit designator names (e.g., suite, room, stop, etc.) listed in USPS
Publication 28, "Postal Addressing Standard," (reference (r)). The word "box" shall not be used as a sec-
ondary unit designator because it may result in mail being sent to Post Office boxes instead of the
intended location.
C3.3.2.4.2.2. In Postnet delivery point barcodes, the last two digits of the secondary unit designator num-
ber are placed after the ZIP+4 Code. This allows the USPS' automated sorting equipment to sort the mail
in secondary unit designator (or delivery point) sequence.
C3.3.2.4.2.2.1. Since the Postnet barcode does not accept alpha characters, they are not allowed in the
number following the secondary unit designator's name. For example, use Suite 123, not Suite ABC.
C3.3.2.4.2.2.2. The USPS' automated equipment cannot sort the mail in delivery sequence if the last two
digits of the secondary unit designator are duplicated within a +4 Code. For example, Suites 010, 110,
210, and 310 all end in 10. If they are used with the same +4 Code, the mail for all three will end up inter-
mixed in one bundle.
80                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C3.3.2.5. Written requests for adding streets and secondary unit designators (if applicable) must be sent
to the AMS Office (see paragraph C3.2.2.2.) responsible for the area where the street addresses are
located. That office will enter them and assign the ZIP+4 Codes. The written request should:
C3.3.2.5.1. Ask that the streets and/or secondary unit designators be added to the file and coded in a man-
ner that allows efficient manual sorting and future automated delivery point sequencing to the secondary
unit designator level when the later are used.
C3.3.2.5.2. Show a separate listing (including the street address and secondary unit designator range) for
each + Code desired. (For example: If two +4 Codes are desired, the first line would read 123 Iolani
Street Stops 001 through 060. The next line would read 123 Iolani Street Stops 061 through 120.
C3.3.2.5.2.1. Any number of secondary unit designators can be included in a range as long as the last two
digits of the designators are not duplicated. For example, Stops 10 and 110 can not be included in the
same range because 10 is the last two digits in both. This limits the number of secondary unit designators
per +4 Code to 100.
C3.3.2.5.2.2. Where the secondary unit designators refer to distribution cases or mail receptacles and the
cases or receptacles are divided into physically separated groups, one +4 Code should be requested for
each group. Additional +4 Codes should be requested if any group has more than 100 secondary unit des-
ignators.
C3.3.2.5.3. The request should also indicate:
C3.3.2.5.3.1. Whether the secondary designators are residential or business addresses.
C3.3.2.5.3.2. Whether the secondary designators are vacant or seasonal addresses (used only part of the
year). If seasonal, indicate when the addresses are vacant (e.g., May, June, and July).
C3.3.2.5.3.3. The number of families or businesses per secondary designator: (Normally it is one).
C3.3.2.5.3.4. Which days delivery is not provided if the address does not receive delivery six days per
week.
C3.3.2.6. City Names
C3.3.2.6.1. A DoD installation's name is the same as a city's name and shall be used as the city name by
all activities on the installation (see DMM A010.6.3., reference (f)). Installation names shall not be
changed when the installation's status changes after 31 December 2001. Doing so creates unnecessary
changes in thousands of address lists within and outside the Department of Defense. Status indicators are
words such as annex, Reserve, camp, station, and words that indicate the type of activity on the installa-
tion.
C3.3.2.6.2. A Washington, DC address shall be used only by those DoD activities physically located
within the District of Columbia and the Pentagon building.
C3.3.2.6.3. DoD activities not covered by the above shall use the name of the city specified by the USPS
for their location.
C3.3.3. Only the USPS can deliver items to Post Office Box addresses, normally a fee must be paid to use
such addresses, the box holders must go to the post office to pick-up the mail, and there are limitations on
mail forwarding when the boxes are closed. Post Office Box addresses may be used only:
C3.3.3.1. For responses to recruiting publicity, surveys, and other purposes where the mailer is unlikely
to want to use an overnight service or a carrier other than the USPS.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                         81


C3.3.3.2. By DoD activities served by post offices that have only post office box delivery.
C3.3.3.3. By U.S. Marine Corps deploying units. Also, see paragraph C3.3.2.2.4.
C3.3.4. The USPS shall be instructed, in writing, to return to the sender all incoming official and personal
mail for non-deploying units/commands without a valid street address beginning 6 months after an instal-
lation/activity converts to geographical locatable civilian-style street addresses. After that, any mail
received from the USPS without a valid street address shall be stamped "Return to Sender, Insufficient
Address" and returned to the USPS.
C3.4. USES OF ADDRESSES
C3.4.1. All business cards, organizational sections of telephone directories, letterheads and stationery
items, and publicity items shall include the correct street address and secondary unit designator (when
appropriate) instead of the building number. When an organization has elements at more than one street
address, the street address where the element is located shall be used in the letterhead and addresses for
that element.
C3.4.2. All permanent change of station orders and temporary duty orders for more than 14 days at one
location shall include the correct address where the individual can receive mail for not more than four
months while a permanent address is established. The address provided must match an address in the
AMS database. (See section C3.5. for information on how to check the address against the AMS data-
base.) The USPS' Computerized Forwarding System (commonly called CFS) normally requires the old
and new addresses to match addresses in the AMS database.
C3.5. VERIFYING ADDRESSES
C3.5.1. An increasing number of software programs are becoming available that automatically match
addresses against the AMS database when addresses are typed and/or entered into mailing lists and data-
bases. The use of these programs is encouraged.
C3.5.2. ZIP+4 Codes and street addresses can also be verified on the Internet.
C3.5.2.1. Go to the USPS' Home Page at "http://www.usps.com/" and click on "Find ZIP+4 Codes."
C3.5.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) OMMs should encourage ADOs to use this site to verify and confirm
ZIP+4 codes for stateside addresses.
C3.5.2.2. When the ZIP+4 Code Lookup menu appears, follow the prompts on the new screen that
appears. (NOTE: Enter the installation's name as the city name. If the address is found, a standardized
address and ZIP + Code will be provided.)
C3.5.2.3. There are several reasons why an address may not be found.
C3.5.2.3.1. The street, city, or State names or abbreviations may be spelled wrong. Make the necessary
corrections and try again.
C3.5.2.3.2. The street number may not be within the range of valid numbers for that street.
C3.5.2.3.3. The street name and number may not be in the database because it is a new housing develop-
ment or industrial park that has not been entered into the AMS database. Many college and university
addresses are also not listed. Also, if the DoD installation has not converted to street addresses its
addresses will not be there.
82                                 DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C3.5.2.3.4. There are three potential causes if the installation has street addresses, and the addresses are
not found: the addresses were not entered in the AMS database, the addresses were not associated with
the installation's name in the AMS database, or the installation's name is not considered a valid city name
in the AMS database. Follow these procedures to identify the cause.
C3.5.2.3.4.1. First, verify whether the installation's name is considered a valid city name. Go back to the
ZIP+4 Code Lookup menu and click on "City State/ZIP Code Associations." Enter the installation's name
followed by a comma, a space, and the state's name or two-letter abbreviation. (NOTES: Be sure they are
spelled correctly. Normally, the installation's name will be spelled out in the database, such as Andrews
Air Force Base. Commonly used abbreviated forms, such as Andrews AFB, are also frequently included.
One of these versions of the name must be entered to obtain a match.)
C3.5.2.3.4.2. If the installation's name is a valid city name, the ZIP Code(s) assigned to the installation
will be provided. In this case, the problem is with the street address. See paragraph C3.5.2.3.3.
C3.5.2.3.4.3. If the installation's name is not a valid city name, enter the installation's ZIP Code instead of
the name of the installation and State. The name of the post office to which the ZIP Code is assigned will
appear. If the post office on the installation does not have its own postmaster, the installation's name
should appear as a community name. If the installation's name does not appear the responsible Address
Management Systems Office must change the AMS. See paragraph C3.2.2. for who to contact.
C3.6. ADDRESS FORMATS
C3.6.1. The use of office symbols and mail codes is discouraged, as they are more difficult to sort mail
by than ZIP+4 Codes and plain English text. They are not necessary when appropriate secondary unit
designators are included in the delivery address line. USPS Publication 28, "Postal Addressing Stan-
dards" contains a list of acceptable secondary address unit designators.
C3.6.1.1. (Added)(AF) Expanded Explanations. The delivery address for official mail going to
CONUS non-pouch locations will be prepared to meet USPS automation requirements. Mailers
will use uppercase, spell out the base name, use the standard state abbreviation, no punctuation
(except hyphen in the ZIP+4 code), type or print delivery address.


EXAMPLE:

Installation Name, State Abbreviation, and                     OFFUTT AFB NE 68113-4013
Nine-digit ZIP + 4 Code


C3.6.2. Each address line will be limited to a maximum of 40 characters (including spaces) with a maxi-
mum of 8 separate words. Addresses shall have a minimum of three lines and not more than five lines
arranged in the following order:
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                           83


C3.6.2.1. Last Line. This line contains the City, State, and ZIP+4 Code. See paragraph C3.3.2.2. for
information about city names.
C3.6.2.1a. (Added)(AF) Delivery addresses lines must be flush on the left hand side to meet USPS
automation requirements. Mailers will use uppercase, spell out the base name, use the standard
state abbreviation, without punctuation except the hyphen in the ZIP+4 Code.
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx                    Attention line
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx                    Optional Line
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx                    Name of DoD Activity
   Street address, Suite #
   or PO Box #                         Delivery address line
   City State ZIP+4 Code               Last line


C3.6.2.2. Delivery Address Line. This line shall consist of a street address, and when appropriate, a sec-
ondary unit designator (such as suite (STE) or room (RM)) or a post office box number. (See USPS Pub-
lication 28, sections 211, 212, 213, reference (r)). ) A street address consists of the street number and
street's name such as 2461 Eisenhower Avenue. (NOTE: Addresses having a post office box address
may include a street address. This is called a dual address and requires special treatment. See paragraph
C3.6.2.6.)
C3.6.2.3. Name of DoD Activity Line. This line shall consist of the name of the DoD activity.
C3.6.2.4. Optional Line. This line may be used only when the Name of DoD Activity Line and the Atten-
tion Line do not adequately identify the addressee.
C3.6.2.5. Attention Line. The attention line contains the name of the office or title of a position (e.g. Sup-
ply Officer) that is to receive the item. When known, the action officer's name may be placed at the end
of this line. "Commander" may be used only when the name of the appropriate office is unknown.
C3.6.2.6. Dual Addresses. A dual address occurs when both a street address and a PO Box address
appear in the address. USPS normally delivers to which ever appears in the delivery line. If both appear
in the delivery line the mail will be delivered to the PO Box. See DMM A010.5 (reference (f)).
C3.6.3. The standard address abbreviations specified in USPS Publication 25 (reference (o)) and USPS
Publication 28 (reference (r))shall be used in the last line, the delivery line, and the DoD Activity Name
Line. Other variations are not recognized by the USPS' automated equipment. The DoD Activity Name
Line may also be spelled as it appears in the USPS' ZIP+4 Files. Most abbreviations found in dictionaries
are also acceptable.
C3.6.4. "Resident," "occupant," or similar forms of address shall not be used except on items addressed
to Government quarters/housing.
C3.6.5. Return Addresses
C3.6.5.1. Formats

C3.6.5.1a. (Added)(AF) Centered return addresses are less prone to be read by USPS automated
equipment reading as the delivery addresses. Use of nonstandard fonts for the return address
serves the same purpose.
C3.6.5.1.1. Format A. The DoD preferred format for return addresses on all prepaid postage mail. It is
mandatory for customs and security reasons on mail addressed to and from MPOs and on international
mail.

C3.7. PRINTING ADDRESSES
C3.7.1. Delivery addresses may be hand printed (hand printed, no script) only when no automation or
other methods of typing are available. In cases where offices lack the equipment necessary to prepare
addresses complying with the USPS requirements for automated mail processing, preprinted address
labels for addresses to which items are regularly sent shall be obtained from higher command levels.
Hand printed addresses must be legible and easily read. Hand written or mechanically produced script
and slanted letters shall not be used in addresses. See DMM C630 (reference (f)) for acceptable fonts and
type sizes and additional instructions. Both capital and small letters may be used. Labels may be used for
addressing all sizes of mail.
C3.7.1.1. (Added)(AF) Official Mail Centers will return outgoing mail received from their ADO
with return and delivery addresses not meeting USPS automation requirements. A complete return
or delivery address must contain the organization/FAS, street address, installation name, state
abbreviation, and nine-digit ZIP+4 Code.
C3.7.2. Return Addresses
C3.7.2.1. Preprinting the return address on envelopes is optional.
C3.7.2.2. Under certain conditions, the USPS' automated equipment may read the return address, think it
is the delivery address, barcode it accordingly, and send the piece back to the mailer. Prevent this by
using a font and type size not listed as acceptable in DMM C630 (reference (f)).
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                      85


C3.7.3. Rubber stamps frequently create unreadable addresses and shall not be used for either return or
delivery addresses.
C3.7.3.1. (Added)(AF) Rubber stamps may be used for return addresses, but not for delivery
addresses.
C3.7.3.2. (Added)(AF) Official Mail Centers will return outgoing mail received from their ADO
with return and delivery addresses not meeting USPS automation requirements. A complete return
or delivery address as a minimum must contain the organization/FAS, street address, installation
name, state abbreviation, and nine-digit ZIP + 4 Code. Official Mail Managers (OMM) may grant
exceptions to the above policy on return of mail for delivery addresses that do not meet USPS auto-
mation requirements. The exception must be based on a study revealing that the use of ZIP + 4
deliveries addresses for the purpose of presorting outgoing mail for USPS presort discounts is not
cost effective because of equipment and manpower cost. When exceptions are granted, OMMs
should encourage mailers to type or mechanically print ZIP + 4 addresses on all mail that will be
tendered to USPS for delivery. OMMs may not grant exceptions for mail received from ADOs or
other activities with return addresses that do not meet USPS automation standards.
C3.7.3.3. (Added)(AF) Mail received at Official Mail Centers from USPS or other private carriers
with return or delivery addresses that do not meet USPS automated requirements will be delivered
to the addressee.
C3.8. ADDRESS CHANGES
It is essential that DoD activities keep their addresses up to date. DoD activities shall submit USPS
change of address cards when any of the events listed below occur. Also, contact the local USPS account
representative or Business Service Center to have appropriate changes made in the AMS database.
C3.8.1. An activity moves.
C3.8.2. An activity ceases to conduct business under its current name (may be renamed, deactivated, or
cease to exist).
C3.8.2.1. (Added)(AF) Official Mail will be returned to sender effective the date of deactivation.
C3.8.3. A new DoD activity begins conducting business (may be the result of a renaming, activation, or
creation).
C3.9. ZIP CODES AND BARCODES
C3.9a. (Added)(AF) ADOs are not required to endorse class of service for flats or parcels
addressed to intra-theater or CONUS pouch locations.
C3.9.1. Assignment of new or additional ZIP+4 Codes shall be requested from the responsible Address
Management Systems Office. See paragraph C3.5.2.3.4.2. (NOTE: DoD activities that have an MPO
return address should contact their MPO to obtain additional +4 Codes.)
C3.9.2. Use of the ZIP+4 Code is mandatory in all return addresses.
C3.9.3. Use of the ZIP+4 Code in delivery addresses is encouraged when known or when determining it
is cost-effective.
C3.9.3.1. (Added)(AF) Include the APO number and ZIP+4 Code add-on on all mail addressed to
APO/FPO addresses.
86                              DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C3.9.4. The ZIP+4 Code on dual addresses must correspond to the place where USPS delivers the mail.
See DMM A010.5 (reference (f)).
C3.9.5. ZIP+4 Codes used on business reply mail (BRM) and merchandise return service (MRS) differ
from those used on regular mail. The ZIP+4 Codes, and barcodes, provided by USPS for these purposes
shall be used.
C3.9.6. The application of barcodes recognized by the USPS is encouraged when cost-effective. (NOTE:
Barcodes created by word processing, database, spreadsheet, and similar computer programs normally do
not qualify for postage discounts because the program does not match the addresses against the AMS
database nor provide the documentation required by the USPS. Barcodes printed by these programs shall
not be put on mail because they may not be correct and the USPS' automated mail processing equipment
ignores them.)

                                             C4. CHAPTER 4
                                         TERRORIST THREATS
C4.1. GENERAL
This Chapter provides information about and guidance on terrorist threats involving mail and place
bombs plus biological and chemical agents. All mail center managers shall include instructions on what
to do if a threat is received in their mail centers' written operating procedures. All mail center personnel
shall be educated on the instructions.
C4.1.1. (Added)(AF) Mail center managers must ensure personnel understand local reporting pro-
cedures to handle threats received or identified within a work center. Personnel should follow
instructions of first responders.
C4.2. MAIL BOMBS
C4.2.1. General. Unfortunately, a small number of mail bombs HAVE been mailed over the years.
While most of them are sent through the USPS, they can also be sent through any other carrier. MAIL
BOMBS MUST BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. They can kill and seriously injure. Fortunately, THE LIKE-
LIHOOD OF YOUR EVER RECEIVING A BOMB IN THE MAIL IS VERY REMOTE. Motives for
mail bombs are often revenge, extortion, terrorism, or business disputes.
C4.2.2. Mail Bomb Characteristics. Mail bombs can be enclosed in either a letter or a parcel. Its outward
appearance is limited only by the imagination of the sender. Mail bombs may, or may not, have one or
more of the characteristics listed below. They may even appear to be official mail. Your local police and
the nearest Postal Inspector in charge (obtain the address from your post office) can provide more infor-
mation about mail bombs and what to do when a piece of mail is suspected to be a potential bomb. Most
mail bombs are aimed at a specific person and so are designed to explode when opened.
C4.2.2a. (Added)(AF) MPOs will include the instructions in this chapter in applicable operating
instructions and ensure all personnel are properly trained and the training is documented. OMCs
will develop an operating instruction covering procedures for detecting and disposing of suspected
letter or parcel bombs that may enter the official mail center. Note: Display USPS Poster 26, Letter
and Package Bomb Indicators, in the mail sorting work area.
C4.2.2.1. All mail bombs may:
C4.2.2.1.1. Bear restricted endorsements such as "personal" or "private."
C4.2.2.1.2. Have an inaccurate addressee's name and/or title.
C4.2.2.1.3. Have distorted handwriting, or the name and address may be prepared with homemade labels
or cut-and-paste lettering.
C4.2.2.1.4. Have protruding wires, aluminum foil, or oil stains visible, and may give off peculiar smells.
C4.2.2.1.5. Have a large number of postage stamps.
C4.2.2.1.6. Feel rigid or appear uneven or lopsided.
C4.2.2.2. Parcel mail bombs may:
C4.2.2.2.1. Appear unprofessionally wrapped with several combinations of tape.
C4.2.2.2.2. Be endorsed "Fragile-handle with care" or "Rush-do not delay."
88                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C4.2.2.2.3. Make a buzzing or ticking noise, or a sloshing sound.
C4.2.3. Bomb Threat Precautions. IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE A LETTER OR PAR-
CEL IS SUSPICIOUS, DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE OR WORRY ABOUT POSSIBLE EMBARRASS-
MENT IF THE ITEM TURNS OUT TO BE INNOCENT. Take the following actions:
C4.2.3.1. DO NOT OPEN THE ITEM.
C4.2.3.2. ISOLATE THE ITEM AND EVACUATE THE IMMEDIATE AREA.
C4.2.3.3. LEAVE THE ITEM IN AN OPEN AREA WHERE A ROBOT CAN EASILY PICK IT UP
AND MOVE IT.C4.2.3.4. DO NOT PUT THE ITEM IN WATER OR A CONFINED SPACE SUCH AS
A DESK DRAWER OR A FILING CABINET. If it is placed there and it explodes, pieces of the drawer
or cabinet will become flying shrapnel and injure those trying to remove it.
C4.2.3.5. IF POSSIBLE, OPEN WINDOWS IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA TO ASSIST IN VENTING
POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE GASES.
C4.2.3.6. FIND OUT IF THE ADDRESSEE IS EXPECTING THE LETTER OR PARCEL AND
ADVISE THE ADDRESSEE THAT IT MAY CONTAIN A BOMB.
C4.2.3.7. IMMEDIATELY CONTACT YOUR LOCAL POLICE AND POSTAL INSPECTOR FOR
PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE. (NOTE: At military post office (MPO) locations contact the military
police and the MPO.)
C4.3. PLACE BOMBS
Place bombs are bombs that are put in place by the bomber.
DO NOT MOVE SUSPICIOUS ITEMS OR ITEMS NEAR THEM. IMMEDIATELY EVACUATE
THE AREA AND NOTIFY YOUR SECURITY
OFFICE.
C4.3.1. Place bombs may be aimed at anyone near them, or a specific person.
C4.3.2. Place bombs may explode when they are moved, when something else is moved, at a specific
time, or by remote control.
C4.3.3. A place bomb may be in a vehicle, a box, a briefcase, a toy, or anything else. The appearance and
placement of a place bomb is limited only by the imagination of the bomber. There may or may not be a
warning about the bomb from the bomber.
C4.4. BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL THREATS
The Center for Disease Control recommends the following actions be taken if your activity receives an
Anthrax threat.
C4.4a. (Added)(AF) Replace with Biological and Chemical Threats. In the event of a suspected
biological or chemical threat or attack, immediately contact the local health and security authori-
ties and ask for guidance. Many different biological and chemical agents may be involved in
threats. Each of them requires different treatment.”
C4.4.1. Double bag the letter in zipper-type plastic bags using latex gloves and a particulate (or tubercu-
losis) mask.
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                        89


C4.4.2. Notify both local police (military and civilian) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (they will
arrange to collect the letter) of the threat.
C4.4.3. Notify the local, county and State health departments.
C4.4.4. Notify the State emergency manager.
C4.4.5. Ensure all persons who have touched the letter wash their hands with soap and water. Hand
washing is sufficient for those who have touched the envelope and letter. Decontamination or prophy-
laxis is not warranted.
C4.4.6. List all persons who have touched the letter and/or envelope and provide the list to public health
authorities.
C4.4.7. Notify the Center for Disease Control Emergency Response at 770-488-7100. Also call them if
you have any questions or need more information.

                                             C5. CHAPTER 5
                                   DoD DIPLOMATIC POUCH MAIL
C5.1. PURPOSE
This Chapter establishes the policies and procedures to be followed by DoD activities using the Depart-
ment of State (DoS) Diplomatic Pouch Service (DPS).
C5.2. GENERAL
C5.2.1. DoD activities may use the diplomatic pouch only if there is no other expedient, cost beneficial,
international mail service available. The international mail system and the Military Postal Service (MPS)
shall be used when possible. Generally, this means the pouch will be used only for classified material,
material too large for postal channels, or to diplomatic posts without MPS support. DoD activities using
the pouch shall abide by DoS requirements. The DoS requirements are paraphrased in Appendix 2.
C5.2.2. Empty Pouches. All DoD activities shall immediately return empty pouches to the Diplomatic
Pouch and Mail Division (DPMD) or the diplomatic post. DoD activities shall not use diplomatic
pouches for any purpose other than as a diplomatic pouch.
C5.2.3. Violations. Employees who violate these DoD or DoS policies shall be subject to loss of pouch
privileges and/or disciplinary action.
C5.3. PREPARATION OF MAIL
C5.3.1. Items from Diplomatic Posts
C5.3.1.1. When the diplomatic post charges for use of the pouch service, the originating DoD Component
is responsible for paying those charges for all items it sends through the pouch.
C5.3.1.2. Items originating at diplomatic posts and intended for dispatch into the domestic postal system,
including the military post office (MPO) addresses, are turned over to United States Postal Service
(USPS) at the DPMD. These items must meet USPS standards and other requirements of this Manual.
C5.3.1.2.1. The originator shall apply the appropriate amount of postage at the full, single piece rate. Use
the USPS Zone Chart (Figure C5.F1.) to determine the correct zone for zone-rated postage. When appli-
cation of postage on official, unclassified, mailable items is not feasible at the diplomatic post send the
items to the parent DoD Component for application of postage.
C5.3.1.2.2. The various postal discounts for ZIP+4, pre-bar-coded, presort, and bulk rates require special
documentation and shall not be used.
C5.3.1.2.3. USPS special services such as registered, certified, insured, etc., are not available on this
mail.
C5.3.1.2.4. All unclassified, non-mailable items (because of size, weight, or content) shall be prepared as
required by Department of State (DoS). Tell the addressee the item is being shipped so arrangements can
be made to pick up the item on arrival at the DPMD.
C5.3.2. Items for Diplomatic Posts
C5.3.2.1. Unclassified Items
C5.3.2.1.1. Use the diplomatic pouch only when a military post office address cannot be used.
C5.3.2.1.2. Prepare FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY items per DoD 5400.7-R (reference (p)).
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                       91


C5.3.2.1.3. Do NOT use accountable mail (Express Mail, registered, certified, insured). These services
end at DoS.
C5.3.2.1.4. Use the address format shown in paragraph AP2.4.3.1.
C5.3.2.2. Classified Items
C5.3.2.2.1. Classified items entered into the DPS must be marked "CONFIDENTIAL," "SECRET," or
"TOP SECRET," plus any other markings required by DoD 5200.1-R (reference (n)). These are the only
DoD classified indicators recognized by DoS. DoS assumes items not bearing one of those indicators are
unclassified. Items marked in a way which implies they might be classified or administratively controlled
(i.e., "By Courier," "NOFORN," etc.) will not be accepted.
C5.3.2.2.2. All CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET material must be registered in accordance with para-
graph C5.4.3.2.3.3.2., below.
C5.3.2.2.3. The following apply to CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET items mailed:
C5.3.2.2.3.1. Use the diplomatic pouch only when a military post office address cannot be used.
C5.3.2.2.3.2. Prepare the outer wrapper according to appropriate security requirements of reference (n).
Address it per paragraph AP2.4.3.2.1.
C5.3.2.2.3.3. The inner wrapper shall be addressed per paragraph AP2.4.3.2.2.
C5.3.2.2.3.4. The appropriate security markings and be prepared as required by reference (n).
C5.3.2.3.4. Registry Number. Any item entered into the Diplomatic Pouch Service (DPS) for which the
originator wants a receipt signature from DPMD shall be clearly marked "REGISTERED" and shall have
a registry number. The registry number shall be preceded by a designation which identifies it as the reg-
istry number; i.e., RegNum: 123456. (Registered material received for forwarding is not assigned a num-
ber by the forwarding office, but is identified by the originator's registry number.) The registry number
shall be typewritten. On envelopes and flats the registry number shall appear in the lower left corner of
the envelope or the address label. On parcels and nonconveyables the registry number shall be in the
lower left corner of the address label.
(When items are sent to the DPMD via USPS registered mail, the USPS registered mail number on the
outer wrapper shall be used as the registry number on the inner wrapper. When items for more than one
addressee are consolidated under one USPS registry number, identify each item by adding a different let-
ter after the USPS registry number on the inner wrapper.)
C5.3.3. DoD TOP SECRET material shall be sent via the Defense Courier Service (DCS) to the DoS for
delivery by appropriate means. The Defense Courier Service (DCS)-unique two-line address for DoS is:
 449321-BA23

                                             C6. CHAPTER 6
               MAIL CENTER OPERATIONS - STARTING, ENDING, AND MOVING
C6.1. PURPOSE
This Chapter sets forth guidance on beginning mail service, guidance for activity deactivations and instal-
lation closures, guidance for activity or mail center movement or name changes, planning the new mail
center, designing the mail center, and establishing the new mail center.
C6.1.1. (Added)(AF) Contact MAJCOM OMM and postal staff for assistance prior to activating or
designing a new mail center.
C6.2. GUIDANCE FOR BEGINNING MAIL SERVICE
This guidance is designed to help smooth the beginning of mail operations when a new activity is created.
When a new DoD Component is being created, contact the DoD Official Mail Manager, Military Postal
Service Agency, 2461 Eisenhower Ave STE 812, Alexandria, VA 22331-0006 or at
DoDomm@hqda.army.mil.
C6.2.1. Ask the following questions. Where will the activity be located? When will it begin operations
there? Does the building exist or is it being built to the activity's specifications? Will the activity be
located on one floor or more than one floor in the new building? Who is designing the new facility? Who
is allocating the space? Who is coordinating the move into the facility?
C6.2.2. Designing the new mail center should be a top priority. It is very costly and may be impossible
to make changes after the building has been designed and especially so once construction has begun.
Contact the facility's designer, the one allocating the space, and the move coordinator to arrange to meet
with them regarding the size and design of the new mail center, delivery of mail in the new facility, and
the move to the new facility. Guidance on things to consider in designing the new mail center is included
in section C6.6.
C6.2.3. What staff element will operate the mail center?
C6.2.4. Find out how to hire mail center employees. The mail center is a vital communications and trans-
portation center for the activity. Since its employees can affect the efficiency of the entire activity, they
must be trustworthy. Be sure to check the selected applicants' references, particularly former employers.
When properly completed, the guidance on things to consider in designing the new mail center in C6.5.
will provide the justification for needed employees as well as the duties and qualification requirements to
be included in their position descriptions.
C6.2.5. United States Postal Service (USPS)-related actions:
C6.2.5.1. Coordinating the move with the USPS Account Representative or Postal Business Center is
very important. Start it as soon as possible. The post office near the new location will know which
Account Representative or Postal Business Center to contact for assistance in establishing postal service
for the new location.
C6.2.5.2.1. The date operations are to begin.
C6.2.5.2.2. The street address and suite number (if applicable and known) where mail is to be delivered.
C6.2.5.2.3. The approximate annual dollar value of postage to be used by the organization.
94                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C6.2.5.2.4. Estimated volumes by type of outgoing mail (letters, flats, parcels, Express Mail, and special
services such as insured, certified, registered).
C6.2.5.2.5. Estimated volumes by type of incoming mail (letters, flats, parcels, Express Mail, business
reply mail, return service, and special services, such as insured, certified, registered).
C6.2.5.3. Things to be considered or asked:
C6.2.5.3.1. What is the correct address for the new location?
C6.2.5.3.2. What post office provides service to the new location?
C6.2.5.3.3. How, when, and where will the organization's mail be picked up and delivered? There can be
a problem with accountable mail (registered, insured, certified, and Express Mail) depending on the type
of carrier route involved.
C6.2.5.3.4. ZIP Codes and ZIP+4 Codes:
C6.2.5.3.4.1. Are sufficient ZIP+4 Codes available for assignment to the major delivery points within the
organization?
C6.2.5.3.4.2. Organizations receiving large quantities of mail are sometimes assigned their own ZIP
Code.
C6.2.5.3.4.2.1. If the organization has its own ZIP Code, the entire range of ZIP+4 Codes from 0002
through 9999 is available for assignment to elements of the organization. The ZIP+4 Code of 0001
should not be assigned internally as it is used by the Postal Service as a default. See section C3.3. for
additional guidance.
C6.2.5.3.4.2.2. When the organization has its own ZIP Code, the Postal Service normally will not sort to
the ZIP+4 Code level. When the organization does not have it own ZIP Code the Postal Service may
include the organization's ZIP+4 Codes in the automated mail processing sort plan so the mail arrives at
the organization already sorted to the ZIP+4 Code level.
C6.2.5.3.5. How to apply for permits, business reply mail permit, return service permit, and Periodicals
rate publications permit (as needed).
C6.2.5.3.6. How to design the front of the mail piece and the address to be used if business reply mail or
return service is to be used.
C6.2.5.3.7. How to establish a Centralized Automated Payment Systems account and/or trust accounts at
the local post office (when applicable).
C6.2.5.3.8. How to apply for a postage meter license, if applicable.
C6.2.5.3.9. How to order postage stamps by phone.
C6.2.5.3.10. Where are the various types of permit mailings and postage discount mailings accepted?
C6.2.5.3.11. Which of the organization's projected mailings are covered by the Private Express Statutes
and thus must go through the USPS unless one of the exemptions applies? Which mailings are covered
by exemptions to the Private Express Statutes? (Transportation rates, quality of service, and preparation
costs for all carriers should be compared to determine the most cost-effective carrier for items not covered
by the Private Express Statutes and for those items covered by an exemption thereto.)
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                          95


C6.2.5.3.12. How are stamped envelopes and cards, with or without a preprinted return address, pur-
chased?
C6.2.5.3.13. What are the qualification requirements for postage discounts? For what postage discounts
may the organization's mail qualify? If it is not cost-effective for the organization to meet the barcode and
presort requirements or the volume of mail is insufficient to qualify for discounts, are there any businesses
or organizations in the area that can help qualify the mail?
C6.2.6. Postage Funds
C6.2.6.1. Make necessary changes in budgeting and resource management to put money at appropriate
locations.
C6.2.6.2. Develop and publish procedures on how the official mail manager will obtain funds when
needed and how they are to be controlled and accounted for.
C6.2.6.3. Obtain a check or cash for the initial setting of postage on the new commercial meter when it is
checked into service.
C6.2.6.4. Establish a policy precluding the carry-over of more than 45 days usage at the end of a fiscal
year. This applies to postage stamp inventories, postage on meters, and funds in trust accounts (TAs).
Funds in TAs for meter settings should be combined with amounts on postage meters for this purpose.
C6.2.6.5. Establish procedures to gather and report prepaid postage purchase data required by RCS
DD-AT&L(SA)1833 (paragraph C2.3.6.). RCS DD-AT&L(SA) 1833, Prepaid Postage Report has been
assigned to this information requirement in accordance with DoD 8910.1-M (reference (e)).
C6.2.7. Equipment
C6.2.7.1. Postage Meters (if used):
C6.2.7.1.1. Apply for a license to operate a "commercial" postage meter at the post office having jurisdic-
tion over the address where the meter will be used.
C6.2.7.1.2. Specify a commercial, remotely set postage meter in the lease. Postage meters must be
leased. The USPS does not allow them to be purchased.
C6.2.7.1.3. Determine what postage meter-related equipment will be needed and make arrangements to
lease or procure it.
C6.2.7.2. Equipment Placement. See paragraph C6.5.3.3.2.
C6.2.7.3. Equipment Selection. See paragraph C6.5.3.3.3.
C6.3. GUIDANCE FOR ACTIVITY DEACTIVATIONS AND INSTALLATION
CLOSURES
C6.3.1. Advanced preparation is required to ensure all DoD official mail-related funds are recovered and
properly disposed of when a DoD activity ceases to exist or an installation is closed.
C6.3.2. When will mail center operations permanently end at the present location? Obtain an approxi-
mate date if the final date is unknown.
C6.3.3. Determine the contract expiration date for all equipment leases and other contracts for supplies
and services. Will the contracts need to be terminated sooner or extended? Are the quantities provided
by the contractor still valid given the amount currently on hand and the mail center's closing date?

C6.3.4. Contact the various contractors, the local post office, and the Postal Business Center and/or
Account Representative and inform them of the pending change and ask for assistance.
C6.3.5. Inventory postage on hand and establish limits on additional purchases so minimal amount is on
hand when operations cease.
C6.3.6. Notify correspondents of the change. Ask correspondents to delete the organization from their
mailing lists. Ask for refunds on unexpired periodical subscriptions. Make sure individuals and DoD
activities that move to another location obtain a new address and submit a PS Form 3575, "Change of
Address Order," to the old postmaster or military post office (MPO).
C6.3.6.1. (Added)(AF) Official mail is returned to sender, not forwarded, after a base closure.
C6.3.7. Remove internal mail drops to make sure they are empty and that mail has not fallen between
them and the wall.
C6.3.8. Move mail center furniture to make sure mail has not fallen between it and the wall.
C6.3.9. USPS-Related Matters:
C6.3.9.1. Stop ordering postage far enough in advance so minimal amounts of postage funds and stamps
are on hand when operations cease.
C6.3.9.2. Who is responsible for telling the post office in writing when to stop delivering incoming mail?
Has it been done?
C6.3.9.3. Has the post office been told in writing what to do with incoming mail after operations stop?
Who is responsible for doing it?
C6.3.9.4. Obtain refunds from all trust accounts with the USPS. NOTE: The organization may have trust
accounts at more than one post office and also may have a Centralized Automated Payment System
(CAPS) Account.
C6.3.9.5. Check postage meters out of service at the post office and obtain refunds for postage remaining
on the meters either on the spot or by completing Section F (REFUND) on PS Form 3601-C (Postage
Meter Activity Report). The meter manufacturer's representative must be present except when the meter
is checked out of service at MPOs.
C6.3.9.6. Has the activity recently checked out of service a defective postage meter but the amount
remaining on the meter could not be determined? Has the refund been obtained? If not, what is to hap-
pen to it?
C6.3.9.7. What is to be done with the refunds from Postal Service trust accounts and postage on postage
meters?
C6.3.9.8. What is to happen to any postage stamps on hand when operations stop?
C6.3.9.9. Have all meter licenses and various permits (at one or more post offices) been canceled in writ-
ing?
C6.3.9.10. The names of most DoD installations are listed in the USPS' address management system
AMS database as city names. When an installation closes, ask the Postal Service to delete its name and
ZIP Code from the database. This is very important for reducing the volume of mail sent to the installa-
tion after it closes.
C6.3.10. Equipment and Facility:
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                             97


C6.3.10.1. Who is responsible for making sure all leased equipment is returned to the owner?
C6.3.10.2. What is to be done with the mail center's furniture, supplies, equipment, and vehicles when
operations stop?
C6.3.10.3. Who turns out the mail center lights at the end of operations?
C6.3.10.4. Who receives the keys to the mail center at the end of operations?
C6.3.11. Who is responsible for determining when employment of the various mail center employees will
stop and for notifying them?
C6.4. GUIDANCE FOR ACTIVITY OR MAIL CENTER MOVEMENT OR NAME CHANGES
C6.4.1. Most of the things needing to be done when an activity or mail center moves are covered in sec-
tion C6.2. and section C6.3. The following also apply to moves:
C6.4.2. Planning for the Move: Management and employees intuitively understand things will be differ-
ent in the new facility. So, moves are an excellent time to improve the appearance and efficiency of the
mail center. There is less resistance to introducing new policies, procedures, and automated/robotics
equipment for mail processing and delivery when the changes are associated with moves. Since these
changes may affect the activity's finances as well as the building's design and space allocation, the mail
center manager must have a plan and sell it to management. OMMs should also review 5-Year Plans and
Business Recover Plans to identify possible appearance and efficiency improvements for the new mail
center.
C6.4.3. How will the staff provide service at both the old and new locations at the same time during the
move?
C6.4.4. USPS-Related Items
C6.4.4.1. If the new location is not served by the same post office, many items in section C6.2. and sec-
tion C6.3. apply.
C6.4.4.2. If the new location is served by the same post office providing service at the old location:
C6.4.4.2.1. Submit a change of address to the Postmaster.
Depending upon what is in the USPS' AMS database, it may or may not be necessary to submit a change
of address if the activity moves to a different location in the same building.
C6.4.4.2.2. When the mail center moves within a building and incoming mail is delivered to the mail cen-
ter versus a loading dock, provide the new location to the Postmaster. Special instructions telling the car-
rier how to gain access to the building may also need changing.
C6.4.4.2.3. Change the activity's address on postage meter licenses, trust accounts, the various permits in
use, post office box or caller service rental records, Consolidated Automated Payment System accounts.
C6.4.4.2.4. Coordinate any changes required in business reply mail and return service pieces.
C6.4.4.2.5. ZIP Code and ZIP+4 Codes:
C6.4.4.2.5.1. If the activity has its own 5-digit ZIP Code, can it continue to use it at the new location?
C6.4.4.2.5.2. The activity can continue to use existing +4 Codes if the activity has and can continue to use
its own 5-digit ZIP Code or is given a new one.
98                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C6.4.4.2.5.3. If the activity does not have its own 5-digit ZIP Code, are the same +4 Codes available at
the new location? If not, are sufficient replacements available?
C6.4.5. Other Considerations
C6.4.5.1. Submit a change of address to all correspondents and vendors. Do not forget periodical pub-
lishers.
C6.4.5.2. Modify contracts and standing delivery orders to show the new locations where maintenance
and other services are to be performed or supplies are to be delivered.
C6.4.5.3. Issue instructions on what to do with existing letterhead and other stationery items and on print-
ing new items.
C6.4.5.4. Advise the telephone and utility companies when and where you are moving.
C6.5. PLANNING THE NEW MAIL CENTER
C6.5.1. Systematic and comprehensive planning for the new mail center helps make sure the new mail
center is efficient. It helps give management confidence that the request for resources is realistic and
should be supported. There is no substitute for systematic, comprehensive planning.
C6.5.2. Make a list of all the mail center's functions. Check it twice to make sure it includes everything.
Then, ask each mail center employee to check the list and add things they do that are not on the list. Be
sure to include overhead functions such as management, vacations, illness, training, etc. This is a good
time to question why each function is performed; eliminate those no longer needed; and when possible,
combine similar functions. It is also an ideal time to add any new functions the mail center should per-
form. When a new activity starts, some of the functions to be considered are processing and delivery of
incoming mail, processing and delivery of internal mail, applying postage and delivery of outgoing mail,
tracking of accountable mail and other controlled items, mail directory service, opening and routing
incoming mail, FAX service, charge-back of postage, and other items.
C6.5.3. For each function, create a detailed list of the necessary amount of time; personnel; furniture;
equipment; vehicles; supplies; storage; floor space; and lighting, electrical, climate, safety, and security
requirements for the function. Attention should be given to using automation and robotics in sorting,
tracking, moving, and delivering the mail and other functions. For the employees, indicate the abilities
and capabilities each must have. What equipment is needed?
C6.5.3.1. For incoming and internal mail, consider sortation equipment, delivery equipment, and tracking
equipment for accountable mail and other internally controlled items.
C6.5.3.2. For outgoing mail, consider sortation equipment, and how the mail will be delivered to the post
office.
C6.5.3.3. Will postage be paid via stamps or meter imprints? If meter imprints are used, a license must
be obtained from USPS. Consider the cost to lease the meter and whether to buy or lease associated
equipment such as scales, postage charge-back equipment, and a printer. Postage meter ink and meter
tape or strips are also required. What city, State, ZIP Code must be in meter postmark die?
C6.5.3.3.1. Supplies and Services. These generally consist of meter tape or strips, ink, ink rollers, main-
tenance, rate changes (both USPS and other carriers), and meter leases. Meter tape and ink specifications
are found in the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) (reference (f)).
C6.5.3.3.2. Equipment Placement. Consider the following when placing equipment:
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                           99


C6.5.3.3.2.1. Mail volume.
C6.5.3.3.2.2. Personnel available to assume the function.
C6.5.3.3.2.3. Unique operational requirements, e.g., mailing needs after duty hours and on weekends.
C6.5.3.3.2.4. If the assignment of a meter will expedite the dispatch of mail.
C6.5.3.3.2.5. Impact on a consolidated mail program.
C6.5.3.3.3. Equipment Selection. The type and size of mail pieces and the form of postage used all must
be considered when purchasing or leasing equipment. Consider the following when selecting equipment:
C6.5.3.3.3.1. Automated feeders are useful only for large volumes of letter-size and flat-size mail that
will go through the equipment.
C6.5.3.3.3.2. A postage tape/strip dispenser is necessary for items too large to go through the equipment.
C6.5.3.3.3.3. Scales:
C6.5.3.3.3.3.1. Obtain only the weighing capacity that is needed as the larger the capacity of a scale the
more it costs. A weighing platform with rollers may be useful if the scale will be used in a production
line.
C6.5.3.3.3.3.2. Mechanical scales may be less expensive than electronic scales and are useful in locations
where only a few items are mailed daily or in locations where wind, movement, or vibrations preclude the
use of electronic scales. Mechanical scale operators must know how to use postage rate charts to deter-
mine the correct amount of postage for each mail piece.
C6.5.3.3.3.3.3. Electronic scales have many advantages over mechanical scales but normally cost more.
Generally, they can not be used in locations that are drafty, that move, or that vibrate. The price of elec-
tronic scales depend upon the weighing capacity and the number of features or functions the scale can per-
form. Do not obtain weighing capacity or features that will not be used.
C6.5.4. Combine the lists into a master chart. Place the longer list (functions or requirements) down the
left edge of the chart and the other list across the top. When creating this chart, list similar functions and
requirements adjacent to each other. This will make it easier to locate duplicate requirements. The master
chart will also point out similar requirements where duplicate resources can be eliminated or additional
flexibility gained by having furniture, equipment, etc., that meets all the similar requirements.
C6.5.5. Using the master chart, create a resource list for the new mail center. Under each resource, list
the resource's specifications that must be met and the functions the resource satisfies. Double-check the
list to make sure all functions and resource specifications are included.
C6.5.6. Make a list of things in the current resources that prevent efficient operations.
C6.5.7. Equipment and Furnishings
C6.5.7.1. Using the resources list created above, make a list of equipment and furnishings needed in the
new mail center. Include the functional specifications and electrical and space requirements for each
item. Compare this list with the list of existing resources.
C6.5.7.2. Make a list of existing resources to be moved to the new facility and a separate list of items to
be purchased or leased for the new facility.
C6.5.7.3. Make a list of items that will not be needed after the move and find out what to do with them.
100                                DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C6.6. DESIGNING THE MAIL CENTER
C6.6.1. Some mail center furniture vendors have design kits that are useful in designing a mail center.
Some will submit, free of charge, a proposal that includes an efficient mail center design and prices for
new furnishings. Ask the vendor to provide references of customers that have accepted their design and
purchased their furniture at least 6 months previously. Make arrangements to visit those customers' mail
centers and find out what they like and do not like about the design and furnishings provided by the ven-
dor.
C6.6.2. Some things that must be considered include the following: How will the work flow? What are
the equipment electrical requirements? Is adequate heating and cooling available? Is the lighting in the
proper locations and adequate? Is there access from the mail center to a loading dock? Is there adequate
vehicle parking at the loading dock? Is there a lift or some other method that will allow mail carts to be
rolled between the loading dock and vehicles having various loading bed heights? Are hallway, door, and
aisle widths adequate for mail transport equipment? How will mail be moved between floors in
multi-story buildings? Where are the customers who generate and receive large volumes of mail? Is there
adequate storage for supplies and equipment? How much mail will be processed? What is the number of
primary and secondary mail sorts? Is the mail primarily letters, flats, or parcels? Parcels require much
more floor space than letters and flats. Does the volume of accountable mail and other items that must be
tracked justify the cost of an automated tracking system? Where will the USPS and other carriers deliver
incoming items and how much space is required? On DoD installations, can the mail center be located
next to the post office? Improve mail center security by:
C6.6.2.1. Providing lockable storage outside the mail center for employees to store personal belongings
rather than bringing them into the mail center.
C6.6.2.2. Designing the facility and locating supervisors so they can see the entire work area.
C6.6.2.3. Blocking customer access to mail processing areas through the use of walls, furniture, counters,
half doors, etc.
C6.6.2.4. Providing lockable USPS-approved boxes when customers pick-up their mail from the mail
center. Placing the boxes so the customers do not need access to the mail center to get their mail reduces
interruptions for the mail center's staff and allows customers to obtain their mail any time. Secure doors
on the mail center's side of the boxes provide security for the mail center when the staff is not placing mail
in the boxes. (NOTE: Do not use the word "box" in the address; doing so may cause addresses to be
changed and the mail to be sent to post office boxes. See USPS Publication 28, "Postal Addressing Stan-
dards" (reference (r)), for acceptable substitutes.)
C6.7. ESTABLISHING THE NEW MAIL CENTER
C6.7.1. Who is responsible for planning and coordinating the movement of existing and the delivery of
new furniture, equipment, and supplies to the new facility?
C6.7.2. Who submits requests for contracts/leases? Who issues the contract/lease? How will contracted
items or services be paid for?
C6.7.3. What date will operations begin at the new mail center?
C6.7.4. What date must the new mail center facility be ready for occupancy?
C6.7.5. When and how will existing mail center equipment, furniture, and supplies be moved to the new
facility? Who will install them?
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                   101


C6.7.6. When will the new equipment, supplies, and furniture be delivered to the new facility? Who will
be there to accept them? Who will install them?
C6.7.7. Will the move necessitate an interruption of service to the customers? If so, for how long? Who
will notify the customers and how will they be notified?

                                   C7. (Added)(AF) CHAPTER 7
          OFFICIAL MAIL CENTER (OMC) INFORMATION TRANSFER SYSTEM
C7.1. (Added)(AF) GENERAL
C7.1.1. (Added)(AF) Responsibilities and procedures for managing the OMC and Activity Distri-
bution Offices (ADO).
C7.2. (Added)(AF) RESPONSIBILITIES
C7.2.1. (Added)(AF) SAF/XCIFO establishes basic policy and procedures for managing the OMC.
C7.2.2. (Added)(AF) The installation commander must provide facilities, equipment, vehicles,
resources, and services for efficient OMC operation, according to Air Force instructions and mis-
sion requirements of organizations served.
C7.2.3. (Added)(AF) The Air Force designates OMC personnel by virtue of their assignment to
OMC duties. Air Force OMC personnel overseas will be appointed as postal clerks on DD Form
2257, Designation/Termination MPC-FPC-COPE-PFO, and DD Form 285, Appointment of Military
Postal Clerk, Unit Mail Clerk or Mail Orderly.
C7.3. (Added)(AF) AIR FORCE PROCEDURES
C7.3.1. (Added)(AF) Only one OMC operates on each Air Force base. All activities, including ten-
ant organizations, should receive and dispatch administrative communications through this system.
C7.3.1.1. (Added)(AF) Military members, government employees, and official organizations must
not use USPS collection boxes for depositing official mail on Air Force installations without first
processing them, i.e., applying metered postage or postage stamps. Official mail must be sent to the
OMC for processing into the USPS system.
C7.3.1.2. (Added)(AF) Official mail can be recalled at any time by completing PS Form 1509,
Sender’s Application for Recall of Mail, regardless of the return address. The office recalling the
article, not the mailing office, has the responsibility to fill out the PS Form 1509.
C7.3.1.3. (Added)(AF) OMC picks up from and delivers to those ADOs designated by the OMM
after coordinating the distribution run schedule. Smaller bases may have ADOs pick up and
deliver mail at the OMC. Official mail will not be picked up from unmanned/unattended distribu-
tion offices. The OMC may leave unclassified and non-accountable mail at temporarily unmanned
activity distribution offices. The OMC must not deliver accountable containers to anyone who is
not designated in writing by the ADO chief or supervisor. OMC workers must check each person’s
appointment letter and ID card before allowing individuals to sign for accountable mail.
C7.3.1.4. (Added)(AF) The commander, staff agency chief, deputy, executive officer, or ADO direc-
tor will appoint assigned individuals to receipt and dispatch communications using Figure C7.F1.,
AF Form 4332, Accountable Communications Receipt Authorization. The appointing official is
responsible to ensure security clearances are verified by the applicable security manager. Appoint-
ment forms should be displayed near the pick-up point at the ADO for easy reference. The OMC
will file appointment letters for 2 years after they are superseded.
C7.3.1.4. (AETC) OMC personnel are authorized to deliver accountable mail to persons who have at least
a Secret eligibility and are identified on AF Form 4332, Accountable Communications Receipt Authoriza-
tion. The Unit Security Manager must verify and sign AF Form 4332. The ADO will ensure a current AF
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                   103


Form 4332 is on file with the OMC for designation purposes. The OMC will review forms semiannually
in March and September and update form as changes occur. The OMC will file AF Form 4332 for 2 years
after they are superseded.
C7.3.1.5. (Added)(AF) Personnel who handle mail or administrative communications must readily
process and transmit these items, and protect them from damage, loss, or theft. Treat information
in these items in confidence and do not disclose it to unauthorized persons. Deliver mail or admin-
istrative communications that are addressed by name and that are clearly of personal interest only
to the addressee, in an unopened state. Examples of this type of communication are items from the
consolidated base personnel office or central civilian personnel office addressed by name.
C7.3.1.6. (Added)(AF) The OMC acts as the agent for all official on-base activities. As the agent,
the OMC completes return receipts when it receives official mail from USPS. All official account-
able mail (registered, insured, certified, express mail, etc.) delivered to ADOs will be signed for.
C7.3.1.6.1. (Added)(AF) Accountable containers or single-wrapped containers with a security clas-
sification must not be left unattended in the OMC, activity distribution or action offices, or in vehi-
cles during or between runs.
C7.3.1.6.2. (Added)(AF) Treat containers picked up from ADOs or incoming mail containing the
endorsement “DO NOT FORWARD” as ordinary First-Class Mail. If the OMC or ADO is holding
this mail at the end of the workday, the ADO will place unprocessed or undelivered First-Class
Mail bearing the notice in a classified storage container. There is no requirement to handle it any
differently than other First-Class Mail during delivery, pickup, or on the mobile distribution vehi-
cle: Note: This endorsement only applies in CONUS; however there is potential to receive it at
overseas locations.
C7.3.1.7. (Added)(AF) The OMC main function is to transfer official administrative communica-
tions between action offices. The OMC can also deliver communications from official sources (as
determined by the return address or official postage), addressed to individuals by name. For
on-base communications, official sources should use the OMC to send items to individuals at their
duty address.
C7.3.1.7.1. (Added)(AF) Usually official sources use the complete official address, including func-
tional address symbol (FAS). Some official sources do not add the FAS in official addresses they
maintain on people. You may deliver communications addressed to individuals at their duty unit
without a FAS, to the unit for further distribution.
C7.3.1.7.2. (Added)(AF) OMC personnel should use every available source to attempt to deliver
mail to individuals from official sources. Process other mail as follows:
C7.3.1.7.2.1. (Added)(AF) Individuals must not use their official activity address to receive per-
sonal mail from unofficial sources except under certain limited circumstances; for example, follow-
ing a permanent change of station (PCS) move. The OMC should instruct these individuals to
immediately notify their correspondents of their personal mailing address. Notify the individual’s
supervisor if corrective action is not taken. OMCs overseas will deliver personal mail received in
official consolidated shipments to the MPO. If the mail shows a name and box number, the MPO
places it in receptacles.
C7.3.1.7.2.2. (Added)(AF) The OMC will not deliver unofficial mass mailings addressed to individ-
uals at the duty address. Mass mailings are defined as 50 or more pieces of mail received on the
104                             DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


same day from the same mailer. In this context, unofficial mail is defined as mail addressed to an
individual that does not have an official return address from a government agency. Such mail will
be returned unopened to sender. ADOs must not destroy it. Exception: Technical and professional
publications mailed at the second class rate of postage are deliverable regardless of the number
received since the Air Force normally pays for such subscriptions. Additionally, some mail from
unofficial sources may be official or quasi-official in nature. Such mail will not usually be received
in large numbers.
C7.3.1.7.2.3. (Added)(AF) The OMM restricts the delivery of personal mail through the OMC
because it delays the processing of official mail and correspondence. On-base personnel and pri-
vate mailers must understand that the uncontrolled addition of personal mail in the OMC inter-
feres with its basic function; the transfer of official communications between action offices.
C7.3.1.8. (Added)(AF) Many sources send mail and administrative communications to the OMC,
addressed in a variety of ways. These policies apply to the delivery of the items:
C7.3.1.8.1. (Added)(AF) The OMC must attempt to deliver any item sent by a U.S. Government
agency, regardless of how addressed, unless there is a valid Postal Service Center (PSC) or unit mail
room (UMR) box in the address. You can identify mail from U.S. Government agencies by the
return address and the official postage meter imprint, or Congressional Frank (signature and title
of an authorized person.) Make every effort to deliver these items to the proper action office or
individual of address. Activities that continually receive incorrectly or incompletely addressed mail
from the same official source should notify the mailer of the correct official mailing address. Activ-
ity personnel can do this with a phone call, E-mail, memorandum, or AF Form 74.
C7.3.1.8.2. (Added)(AF) The OMC will deliver mail addressed to an official activity or military
unit, or mail that contains a FAS or duty title anywhere in the address. This includes mail that con-
tains the name of an individual in the address. See paragraph C7.3.7.2.2 for the one exception.
C7.3.1.8.3. (Added)(AF) The OMC may deliver any item from an Air Force-appropriated fund
source to an individual when the delivery by the OMC avoids payment of postage. These items
must contain a valid unit and FAS in the address.
C7.3.1.8.4. (Added)(AF) You must handle mail addressed to an individual by name on the first line,
or mail that contains a valid PSC or UMR box number in the address, as personal mail except as
provided above.
C7.3.1.8.5. (Added)(AF) Use Table C7.T1. to determine when mail will be delivered through the
OMC or PSC.
C7.3.1.8.6. (Added)(AF) Examples of properly addressed official mail that OMC may deliver:

C7.4. (Added)(AF) HOST BASE OFFICIAL MAIL MANAGER RESPONSIBILITIES
C7.4.1. The host base Official Mail Manager is directly responsible for the operation of an OMC at
the base-level. To do this effectively, the OMM must:
C7.4.1.1. (Added)(AF) Develop local instructions to implement higher headquarters policies and
procedures to operate the OMC efficiently and ensure the availability of personnel, facilities, and
equipment to perform the OMC function. The OMC manager assists the postmaster in the opera-
tion of the OMC and the mobile distribution vehicle (MDV). The OMC manager will develop and
conduct ongoing training for OMC personnel.
C7.4.1.2. (Added)(AF) Provide activities that the OMC supports with a current base information
transfer schedule for planning and information purposes, and for meeting customer needs. The
schedule should reflect a cut-off time for acceptance and for daily dispatch of accountable, regular,
and Express Mail from ADOs. This prevents unprocessed outgoing communications from remain-
ing in the center after the last scheduled run.
C7.4.1.3. (Added)(AF) Provide support to unit activity distribution offices and action offices on the
base, consistent with local requirements and conditions. Provide training to ADOs on an annual
basis, as prescribed in DoD Instruction 4525.8.
C7.4.1.4. (Added)(AF) Authorize activities that receive or dispatch large volumes of communica-
tions to receive or dispatch directly to and from the OMC. The requirements for appointment are
the same as paragraph C7.3.1.4.
C7.5. (Added)(AF) LOCATION AND OPERATION OF THE OMC
C7.5.1. (Added)(AF) When possible, collocate the OMC with the serving postal facility; otherwise,
it should be next to, or as close as possible to, that facility. The OMC has to be able to effectively
process administrative communications for entry into the military postal system. Operation of the
center is as follows:
C7.5.1.1. (Added)(AF) Processing Incoming Communications. OMC immediately processes and
delivers all administrative communications and sealed containers. When the OMC must open a
sealed container to determine the action office, the individuals who opened the container must
mark it, “Opened for Routing,” and initial or sign it. Limit administrative controls to comply with
DoD 5200.1-R and other applicable publications.
C7.5.1.2. (Added)(AF) Processing Administrative Communications. Sort items into distribution
boxes and identify official communications that require further actions. Handle all sealed contain-
ers endorsed “DO NOT FORWARD” as regular administrative communications; however, do not
leave them unattended overnight, they must be secured. This applies to the OMC and all ADOs.

C7.5.1.3. (Added)(AF) Processing Accountable Containers.
C7.5.1.3.1. (Added)(AF) When accountable items are received with incoming mail for processing,
the OMC will begin internal tracking and ensure accountable items are signed for when delivered.
The OMC will sign return receipts, and return them through USPS channels.
C7.5.1.3.2. (Added)(AF) If incoming items are received from other sources, such as another mail
clerk or courier, check each item number, registered, insured, certified, express mail, container
number, etc., ensure that everything is accounted for against transfer documents. Maintain any
documentation, PS Forms 3883, DD Form 2825, Express Mail labels, etc., used to show an unbro-
ken chain of receipts between the OMC and the activity distribution office. Annotate the reverse of
PS Form 3883 or DD Form 2825, as appropriate, to indicate further distribution of any CONFI-
DENTIAL material received in a registered pouch, or consolidated shipment sent to the OMC for
further distribution.
C7.5.1.3.2. (AETC) Use PS Form 3877, Firm Mailing Book for Accountable Mail, and PS Form 3883,
Firm Delivery Receipt for Accountable and Bulk Delivery Mail, to transfer accountability of mail from the
USPS into OMC channels. Staple record copies of DD Form 2825 to AF Form 627, PS Form 3877, and
PS Form 3883. (PS Form 3877 and PS Form 3883 are prescribed by DODM 4525.8_AFMAN 33-306,
DOD Official Mail Manual. Refer to that publication for guidance on completing the forms.)
C7.5.1.3.3. (Added)(AF) Sort accountable containers into distribution boxes, by action or distribu-
tion office, for further processing. Open containers if you cannot determine the addressee or deter-
mine the distribution office to receive the item. Annotate and initial the enclosed AF Form 310,
Document Receipt and Destruction Certificate, showing that the container was improperly
addressed, and provide the proper address. Internally route or prepare new AF Forms 310, or DD
Forms 2825, as required. Place a copy of each form in suspense; insert the AF Form 310 in the con-
tainer, reseal the container, attach a DD Form 2825 to the container, and enter the container into
the distribution system. Do not send accountable containers before verifying the forwarding
address. If the forwarding address is in doubt, return to sender.
C7.5.1.3.4. (Added)(AF) Remove containers from distribution boxes and prepare DD Form 2825
for each distribution office or action office. List accountable mail by its registered, insured, certi-
fied, or express mail number, or Air Force container number. Retain one copy of the DD Form
2825 in the suspense file until a signed DD Form 2825 is returned; then, destroy the suspense copy.
PS Forms 3883 may be used for delivery to ADOs; however, if used they must be consistent for all
ADO deliveries. Clerks must ensure personnel print their name under signatures when signatures
are not legible, for future reference.
C7.5.1.3.5. (Added)(AF) Secure undelivered accountable items remaining in the OMC according to
the type of material they may contain. Secure official registered and items submitted for registra-
tion in a container approved for storage of SECRET material.
C7.5.1.4. (Added)(AF) Processing and Dispatching Outgoing Regular Containers. Expeditiously
process outgoing letters, flats, and parcels received from the MDV according to mail routing
instructions and other portions of this directive.
C7.5.1.5. (Added)(AF) Processing and Dispatching Accountable Containers. When the OMC
receives accountable containers from the MDV, separate them into various categories, such as reg-
istered, certified, express, pouch, etc. Process as follows:
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                   107


C7.5.1.5.1. (Added)(AF) Check the local container number against the DD Form 2825 to verify that
the number on the container matches with the DD Form 2825.
C7.5.1.5.2. (Added)(AF) Place the applicable postal service label (registered, certified, etc.) on the
container. Consolidate mail whenever feasible.
C7.5.1.5.3. (Added)(AF) Record the number and address of registered and certified mail for each
item on PS Form 3877. Maintain separate PS Forms 3877 for registered items; other special ser-
vices may be maintained in the same book. Enter the local container number on the record copy of
the PS Form 3877 for cross-reference purposes.
C7.5.1.5.4. (Added)(AF) Apply postage to all outside articles and dispatch.
C7.5.1.5.5. (Added)(AF) If the OMC is not collocated with or a section assigned to the MPO, deliver
the accountable items to the servicing postal facility with proper transfer documentation for dis-
patch or receipt.
C7.5.1.5.6. (Added)(AF) Use these procedures when processing outgoing certified mail or other
USPS special services when the OMC has not provided the ADO with USPS special service labels:
C7.5.1.5.6.1. (Added)(AF) The mailer will assign a container number and complete DD Form 2825.
C7.5.1.5.6.2. (Added)(AF) Verify the container number against the DD Form 2825 and sign to
receipt for the container.
C7.5.1.5.6.3. (Added)(AF) At the OMC, attach PS Form 3800, Certified Mail, or other special ser-
vice labels to the item. Prepare PS Form 3877 in one copy. Annotate the certified or special service
number on the DD Form 2825 for future reference. The receipt portion of the PS Form 3800 or
other special service label may be disposed of or attached to the applicable PS Form 3877, consis-
tently.
C7.5.1.5.6.4. (Added)(AF) The OMC will postmark the PS Form 3877, and maintain with other
records.
C7.5.1.5.7. (Added)(AF) Maintain DD Form 2825 according to AFI 37-123, and dispose of it
according to the AFRIMS RDS located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds_series.cfm.
C7.5.1.5.8. (Added)(AF) Command Pouch Service. OMC provides activity distribution offices and
action offices with a list of bases and organizations it services with direct pouches. Distribution
offices must mark such mail “Pouch” and separate it from other on/off-base communications.
C7.5.1.5.9. (Added)(AF) Overseas OMCs are responsible for coordinating with the MPO to obtain
postal-related equipment and supplies, such as USPS forms, mail bags, plastic bag inserts, and slide
labels. The OMC will ensure information about preparing slide labels, mail routing, and rate
changes is correct. Use plastic inserts in all mail bags prepared for transport via air.
C7.5.1.5.10. (Added)(AF) Telephone the ADO if the OMC receives Express Mail after the normal
distribution run. The ADO decides whether to pick up the item from the OMC or wait until the
next scheduled run. The OMC will annotate on the envelope itself or the DD Form 2825 (if used)
the person contacted, time contacted and delivery instructions provided. The OMC will not deliver
Express Mail on a separate distribution run or stop.
C7.5.1.5.11. (Added)(AF) USPS-owned equipment such as scales, IRT equipment and meter bases
are not authorized for use in OMCs.

                                   C8. (Added)(AF) CHAPTER 8
                              ACTIVITY DISTRIBUTION OFFICES
C8.1. (Added)(AF) ACTIVITY DISTRIBUTION OFFICES (ADO)
C8.1.1. (Added)(AF) The ADO is the link between the action office and the OMC. The ADO is the
point where the OMC collects and delivers administrative communications to and from the offices
the activity distribution office services. When volumes warrant, the OMM may authorize activity
distribution offices to go directly to the OMC for receiving and dispatching administrative commu-
nications, including parcels (see paragraph C7.4.4.). ADOs are also authorized to receive adminis-
trative communications and parcels directly from private carriers, but ADOs may not dispatch
items directly to private carriers--they must go through the OMC. Agencies or units operate their
own distribution office to meet their needs.
C8.1.1. (AETC) ADOs should be the focal point for the OMC and private carrier deliveries. Additionally,
the suite and room number for each ADO should be the same. The term “RM” (room) may also be used in
the address element to designate actual locations in a building.
C8.1.1.1. (Added)(AF) The commander, staff agency chief, deputy, executive officer, or ADO direc-
tor will appoint assigned individuals to receipt and dispatch communications using Figure C7.F1,
AF Form 4332. Requirements are listed in paragraph C7.3.4. Registered mail may only be dis-
patched and received by individuals who are US Citizens with a SECRET or higher clearance. If
individuals appointed do not have a security clearance, they may receipt for all accountable mail
except Registered. OMC workers will verify ADO authorizations by reviewing appointment letters
and ID card prior to signing over accountable material.
C8.1.1.2. (Added)(AF) Any person employed by activities such as military banking facilities,
AAFES, or DoD Dependent Schools, may be designated to receive registered mail addressed to that
activity. The activity manager or appropriate liaison officer will designate authorized signers
according to paragraph C7.3.4. Note: Presume official registered mail addressed to these activities
does not contain classified material. However, if any doubt exists about the contents of any item,
only an appropriately cleared liaison officer for that activity can receipt for the registered item.
C8.2. (Added)(AF) RESPONSIBILITIES OF ACTIVITY DISTRIBUTION OFFICES
C8.2.1. (Added)(AF) Personnel on duty in distribution offices perform these functions:
C8.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) Review outgoing communications to ensure:
C8.2.1.1.1. (Added)(AF) Mailers use Standard Forms 65-B or 65-C (holey joes) to send unclassified
communications through on-base distribution and to those locations that receive a direct pouch
from the OMC. Lightweight administrative communications (four pages or less) should be placed
in letter-size envelopes.
C8.2.1.1.2. (Added)(AF) Mailers package and address communications correctly and securely
attach DD Form 2825 to accountable items.
C8.2.1.1.3. (Added)(AF) Parcels clearly display essential mailing elements including class of ser-
vice, FAS, ZIP+4 Code, etc.
C8.2.1.1.4. (Added)(AF) Parcels do not exceed size and weight limits.
112                              DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


C8.2.1.1.5. (Added)(AF) Outgoing communications are sorted according to instructions. This
includes separating communications eligible for pouch service and clearly marking it “Pouch.” If
two or more pieces are going to the same location, on the same day, consolidate all pieces in the
same container.
C8.2.1.2. (Added)(AF) Deliver or arrange for delivery of, all administrative communications and
parcels to action offices. They must secure sealed containers that remain in the distribution office
after the close of business that are endorsed “DO NOT FORWARD.”
C8.2.1.3. (Added)(AF) Provide referral service for improperly addressed incoming administrative
communications, including those sent to individuals in a unit without a FAS.
C8.2.1.4. (Added)(AF) Furnish action officers (AO) with OMC distribution schedules. This will
help eliminate the need for action office personnel to perform messenger service, except for the
occasional priority delivery that OMC cannot handle.
C8.2.1.5. (Added)(AF) Instruct AOs who request official or duty-related information from outside
the Air Force to use a complete organizational address and FAS. Review material received from
outside the Air Force to individuals no longer assigned. AOs will distribute materials to persons
currently assigned who can use it. If the mail is of no value, they will notify mailers to remove their
office from their mailing list. Instruct mailers to mark official mail destined to go out of the USPS
Domestic Mail System with the annotation “International Mail.”
C8.2.1.6. (Added)(AF) ADO personnel accept items into the mail system only from authorized
users. ADOs will not accept or dispatch mail from personnel not in their organization (persons
unknown to them).
C8.2.1.7. (Added)(AF) Official mail will not be picked up from unmanned/unattended distribution
offices.
C8.3. (Added)(AF) DELIVERY OF INCOMING MAIL
C8.3.1. Establish procedures to open and deliver incoming mail to action offices. Comply with
paragraph C7.3.5. for mail addressed to assigned personnel by name. If ADOs wish to establish
procedures for centralized opening of items, it is at their discretion.
C8.4. (Added)(AF) LOCATION OF ACTIVITY DISTRIBUTION OFFICES
C8.4.1. (Added)(AF) Delivery points should be limited to a single delivery point on the entry level
floor of each building whenever possible, and constantly monitored to minimize exposure to poten-
tial explosive, biological and chemical hazards. ADOs are responsible for the internal distribution
of items within their facility. ADOs should be on the entry-level floor in multi-story buildings with-
out elevators.
C8.5. (Added)(AF) OFFICE EQUIPMENT AND DESIGN
C8.5.1. (Added)(AF) The space provided and the arrangement of a distribution office must allow
step-by-step processing. The volumes and types of communications the OMC receives and pro-
cesses dictate the equipment. Large distribution offices may require equipment similar to the
OMC, while small distribution offices may only require “In” and “Out” baskets. The ADO is
responsible for procuring and maintaining all equipment.
C8.6. (Added)(AF) ACTIVITY ACTION OFFICES
DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                  113


C8.6.1. (Added)(AF) Prepares administrative communications and containers for release to the
servicing distribution office of the OMC, to include:
C8.6.1.1. (Added)(AF) Classification and special service requests.
C8.6.1.2. (Added)(AF) Addressing to the office that takes action on the subject.
C8.6.1.3. (Added)(AF) Preparing receipts according to DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 3l-401.
C8.6.1.4. (Added)(AF) Processing administrative communications and containers received from
distribution offices or the OMC.
C8.6.2. (Added)(AF) Official mail for people not assigned to the base (such as sponsor packages) is
addressed to their current duty address, not home address. This enables OMC to consolidate mail
and reduce postage costs. If absolutely necessary, send such mail to the leave address.
C8.6.3. (Added)(AF) Routine official messages for assigned personnel should be E-mailed when-
ever feasible. If E-mail is unworkable, send messages through the OMC. Address items to the per-
son’s duty address in the format shown in the basic directive. Items allowed routing via OMC
include: overdue library book notices, eyeglass pickup notices, and medical and dental appoint-
ment slips (for dependents also), and other official material or information collected and delivered
without using postage funds. No special services are authorized.
C8.6.4. (Added)(AF) Ensure personnel whose responsibilities include opening official mail know
they can only release sealed inner envelopes with SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL to individuals with
the proper clearance.
C8.7. (Added)(AF) PREPARING ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNICATIONS FOR DISPATCH
C8.7.1. (Added)(AF) ADOs will develop a log or other tracking systems for accountable container
numbers to avoid duplicating numbers as prescribed by paragraph C1.20.3.1.
C8.7.1.1. (Added)(AF) Table C8.T1. explains how to prepare administrative communications for
on- and off-base dispatch. The OMM may authorize activity distribution offices or action offices
that routinely handle large volumes of accountable communications to use PS Form 3877. All
sealed containers endorsed “DO NOT FORWARD” must remain in action offices at the close of
business in a classified storage container. Inspect unsealed containers to determine the classifica-
tion of their contents and protect them accordingly.
C8.8. (Added)(AF) PREPARING AND USING DD FORM 2825, INTERNAL RECEIPT
C8.8.1. (Added)(AF) Enclose DD Form 2825 in all consolidated shipments, accomplish DD Form
2825 in enough copies to maintain suspense and/or record copies. DD Form 2825 has spaces to
record signatures for changes of custody. Use it to record the exchange of sealed accountable con-
tainers between the dispatching activity, the OMC, and the addressee. The OMC must sign for
accountable containers when accepting them from the dispatching activity distribution office, and
must obtain a signature when delivering accountable containers to the addressee. Note: Receipts
within the OMC are optional. There is no requirement for OMC personnel to receipt for account-
able containers they exchange between themselves.
C8.8.1.1. (Added)(AF) Securely attach DD Form 2825 to the container. When the same DD Form
2825 lists several containers, bundle these containers securely or consolidate them and attach the
DD Form 2825 to the top container.

C8.8.1.2. (Added)(AF) Ensure the office or person having custody of accountable containers gets a
signature from the recipient on the top copy and files it.
C8.8.1.3. (Added)(AF) File and dispose of DD Form 2825 according to the AFRIMS RDS. The
form will be filed with PS Forms 3877 and other Postal Service related forms.

                                     AGREEMENT
                       CONCERNING COMMERCIAL POSTAGE METER USE
                              AT MILITARY POST OFFICE ADDRESSES


                                      (Amendment 1 is Incorporated)


PART I - INTRODUCTION
This agreement between the United States Postal Service and the Department of Defense (as a customer
of the United States Postal Service) provides for the use of commercial postage meters by Department of
Defense activities served by military post offices (APO/FPOs).


PART II - GENERAL PROVISIONS
        1. Except as specifically provided otherwise by this Agreement, all regulations pertaining to the
leasing, licensing, servicing, inspections, and use of postage meters (Section P030 of the Domestic Mail
Manual) shall apply to commercial postage meters leased by the Department of Defense for use at loca-
tions served by a military post office.
        2. The term "post office," as used in the Domestic Mail Manual and elsewhere, shall be understood
to include military post offices.
        3. All Department of Defense mail bearing a commercial postage meter imprint and originating in
an area served by a military post office shall be deposited only in authorized depositories for the United
States Mails.
        4. Either party to this Agreement may terminate the Agreement by providing 30 days prior written
notice to the other party, stating the reasons for the decision to terminate. The United States Postal Service
may terminate this Agreement if revenue cannot be protected. Specific instances of cause for termination
may be the failure of the Department of Defense to maintain control of meter locations, to ensure inspec-
tion as provided by the terms of this agreement, and/or the failure of a manufacturer to inspect as provided
by the terms of this agreement and/or repair meters and maintain the required documentation.
         5. Each party will designate a representative for the purpose of coordinating the Agreement. The
initial designee of the United States Postal Service is the Manager, Mailing Systems Development, 475
L'Enfant Plaza SW, Washington, DC 20260-6807. The initial designee of the Department of Defense is
the Department of Defense Official Mail Manager, Military Postal Service Agency, Alexandria, VA
22331-0006.
      6. Only those activities authorized by both the Postal Service and the DoD representative listed
above may use commercial postage meters.

PART III - PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING AND USING POSTAGE METERS
       1. Lease and Manufacturer Inspection
           a. The Department of Defense activities shall lease postage meters only from Postal Service
       authorized meter manufacturers in the United States. When obtained, the meters must be set to
       show no postage on the meter.
           b. Inspection
                i. "Inaccessible Meter" is any meter leased by the Department of Defense that is likely to
be inaccessible to the manufacturer for a substantial period of time, and that has been identified in writing
by the Department of Defense and the manufacturer as inaccessible. A meter may be inaccessible for no
more than 2 years, at which time it must be checked out of service or presented to the manufacturer for
inspection. The Official Mail Manager of the Department of Defense activity leasing the meter shall send
written notice to the licensing post office in III.4. within 30 days of the commencement of the period of
inaccessibility of a postage meter. Should a meter identified under this paragraph as inaccessible become
accessible, the Official Mail Manager of the Department of Defense activity leasing the meter shall
promptly notify the licensing post office in III.4. of such change.
               ii. Under this agreement, the Department of Defense shall make any inaccessible meter
available for manufacturer inspection at the first available opportunity if more than twelve months have
elapsed since the last inspection.
                iii. Under this agreement, any postage meter that is not identified as inaccessible in
III.1.b.i. may only be leased for, or transferred to, locations where the manufacturer can inspect the meter
each twelve months. Any requests for exceptions will be submitted in writing through the Department of
Defense Official Mail Manager to the Manager, Mailing Systems Development, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW,
Washington, DC 20260-6807. Exceptions shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.
       2. MPO Custodian of Postal Effects shall:
           a. Maintain records as required by the DMM for each meter leased and licensed under the
       terms of this Agreement.
           b. Ensure that meters are set as specified in Section P030 of the Domestic Mail Manual and
       shall provide appropriate instructions to designated military postal service personnel.
           c. Maintain a listing of all commercial postage meters leased to the Department of Defense
       activities served.
          d. Provide to the appropriate gateway postmaster a quarterly report of the location and serial
       number of each meter along with copies of the USPS Form 3610 for these meters.
       3. Transportation of Postage Meters
           a. The manufacturer will notify, in writing, the activity, the MPO, and the appropriate gateway
       postmaster when the meter is shipped. Manufacturers shall ship the meters, by registered mail, to
       the Custodian of Postal Effects at the MPO where the meters are to be set. Upon receipt of a meter
       the Custodian of Postal Effects shall notify the intended user that the meter has arrived and retain
       the meter until the intended user complies with licensing and other requirements.
           b. When a meter is checked out of service the Custodian of Postal Effects shall immediately
       return it to the manufacturer by USPS official registered mail.

       4. Licensing of Postage Meters. Department of Defense activities shall submit PS Form 3601-A
(Application or Update for a License to Lease and Use Postage Meters) as follows:
           a. Activities having an APO/FPO AA and AE address:
       U.S. Postal Service
       Office of Mail Requirements
       ATTN: Meter Section
       Room 3220, JAF Building
       New York, New York 10199-9651
           b. Activities having an APO/FPO AP address:
       U.S. Postal Service
       Office of Mail Requirements
       ATTN: Meter Section
       1300 Evans Ave, Room 303
       San Francisco, CA 94188-9651
           c. Upon receipt of the issued license, the activity will furnish a copy of the license and the cov-
       ering purchase order to the manufacturer who will provide the meter.
       5. Transfer of Meters
           a. Meters may be transferred to another location (military post office) under the same license
       only if they are to be used by the same unit for which the license was issued. The unit shall notify
       by letter the appropriate gateway postmaster, both the gaining and losing military post offices, and
       the meter manufacturer prior to moving the meter.
           b. Meters may not be transferred between licensees.
         6. Repairs to Postage Meters. All repairs will be performed by the manufacturer's meter repair
facilities in the United States. This does not apply to meter bases and other related equipment.
       7. Reporting the destruction, loss, theft, capture, or misplacement of meters. The Department of
Defense will immediately report any such occurrences to the appropriate gateway postmaster (who will in
turn notify the Inspector-in-Charge) and the manufacturer's local representative and United States head-
quarters.
       8. Checking Meters In and Out of Service
           a. Checking meters into service. Meters shall be checked into service at the military post office
       authorized to set them. The meter will be sent by registered mail from the manufacturer to the
       appropriate MPO for the initial setting of the meter and delivery to the leasing activity.
           b. Checking meters out of service. When the use of a meter is terminated for any reason,
       including replacement, the meter shall immediately be checked out of service at the appropriate
       military post office and immediately thereafter the Custodian of Postal Effects shall return it to its
       manufacturer in the United States by USPS official registered mail.
        9. Payment for Postage. All postage set on commercial meters by military post offices shall be
paid for via cash or check presented at the time the postage meter is set.
        10. Advance Deposit Trust Accounts. The use of advance deposit trust accounts is not authorized
at military post offices.

                                            AP2. APPENDIX 2


                                      DIPLOMATIC POUCH MAIL
AP2.1. PURPOSE
This Appendix paraphrases DoS policies and procedures to be followed when using the Department of
State (DoS) Diplomatic Pouch Service (DPS). The policies and procedures in this Appendix agreed with
DoS requirements when they were written. DoS may change their requirements at any time. If that hap-
pens, follow DoS policies and procedures even though they may conflict with this Appendix.


AP2.2. GENERAL
AP2.2.1. Diplomatic pouches are intended to transport items, for the official use of the diplomatic mis-
sion, across international frontiers without procedural delay and without inspection by foreign govern-
ment officials. These are the basic tenets of Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Privileges
and Immunities (reference (q)) and of international law and practices as they regard diplomatic pouches.
The great majority of diplomatic pouches are dispatched unaccompanied; observance of their diplomatic
status is entrusted to the good faith of foreign officials.
AP2.2.1.1. Diplomatic pouches are not marked in any way except as diplomatic correspondence. The
pouch itself must in no way provide clues as to the nature of its contents by displaying notice labels or
organizational symbols. It is an anonymous container. Pouches containing classified items are prepared
and documented in the same manner as pouches containing unclassified items but they are dispatched
accompanied by a diplomatic courier or other authorized U.S. Government employee. Whether the pouch
is dispatched accompanied or unaccompanied, its only purpose is to protect diplomatic and national secu-
rity information. It is not intended to protect items of great monetary value or to function as an express
mail service.
AP2.2.1.2. Pouch contents, regardless of their nature or classification, shall not be disclosed or discussed
with any person except U.S. Government employees with the proper classification and a need to know.
Under no circumstances may they be disclosed to or discussed with foreign officials. See paragraph
C5.3.2. for additional instructions.
AP2.2.1.3. There are no limits on pouch size or weight for official items except those imposed by host
governments (contact DPM or diplomatic post for latest information) and the capacity of the mode of
transport. See section AP2.4. for information on size and weight limitations for various addresses used to
get items into the diplomatic pouches.


AP2.3. CONTROL OF POUCHES AND POUCH CONTENTS
AP2.3.1. Pouch Communications. Communications concerning material to be dispatched by pouch shall
be classified as follows:
AP2.3.1.1. Electronic Inspection. All forms of electronic inspection, including X-ray and metal detectors.
AP2.3.1.2. Physical Inspection. Mail suspected of containing items prohibited for pouch transmission
may be opened for inspection by Pouch Control Officers. Unclassified items may be opened without con-
sent of sender or addressee. Classified items may be opened only in the presence of and with the consent
122                               DODM4525.8_AFMAN33-306_AETCSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2007


of the sender or addressee. If consent is refused, the item will not be accepted for pouch transmission or
returned to the sender when received in an incoming pouch.


AP2.4. PREPARATION OF MAIL
AP2.4.1. Size and Weight Considerations. Items weighing over 40 pounds, or exceeding 62 inches in
length and girth combined, or whose longest dimension exceeds 24 inches cannot be shipped in standard
diplomatic pouches and are called nonconveyable.
AP2.4.1.1. If the item is not for official business and exceeds the weight or size limits, do NOT ship it.
AP2.4.1.2. If the item going to a diplomatic post is unclassified, official business and exceeds the weight
or size limits, call the DoS Unclassified Pouch Branch [(703) 661-6300] for special preparation and deliv-
ery instruction.
AP2.4.1.3. If the item going to a diplomatic post is unclassified and exceeds the weight or size limit, call
the DoS Classified Pouch Branch [(703) 922-3070 or (703) 922-2696] for special preparation and deliv-
ery instructions.
AP2.4.2. Items from Diplomatic Posts
AP2.4.2.1. All items originating at diplomatic posts shall be prepared and presented as required herein
and by the diplomatic post.
AP2.4.2.2. All unclassified, non-mailable items (because of size, weight, or content) shall be prepared as
required by DoS. Originators shall advise the addressee the item is being shipped so arrangements can be
made to pick up the item on arrival the DPM.
AP2.4.3. Items for Diplomatic Posts
AP2.4.3.1. Use the following address format for unclassified items:
(Name of persons or organization)
(Diplomatic post name)
Department of State
Washington, DC 20521-xxxx*
See the chart in AP2.F1. for the appropriate ZIP+4 Code. The use of the correct ZIP+4 Code ensures
