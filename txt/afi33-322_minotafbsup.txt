SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision identifies the base’s central repositories for ERM, specifies Records Professional Training,
updates list of activities which must appoint FARMs, mandates FARM review of unit publications, and
addresses alternate RCs.
6.1.3. Official electronic records will be maintained within the ERM structure (wing/group/squadron/
office) on the designated MAFB central electronic repositories. Mib-fs91sw01 and Mib-fs5bw01 are the
MAFB central electronic repositories designated as the storage space for the 91st Space Wing and 5th
Bomb Wing unclassified electronic records. Mibfs5cs1 is the MAFB central electronic repository for both
wings’ classified electronic records. Records Professionals (CORs, FARMs, and RCs) must continuously
monitor the structure, permissions, and usage of the official files area on the NIPRNET and SIPRNET.

6.3. Training. FARMs and RCs will attend Records Maintenance and Disposition Classroom Training
after completion of the required AF Records Management Computer Based Training (CBT) unless they
have previously received classroom training. Verification of Records Maintenance and Disposition Train-
ing must be presented upon request. At the Base Records Manager’s (BRM’s) or FARM’s discretion, RCs
having a general lack of knowledge of the Records Maintenance and Disposition Program during the
Records Management or FARM SAV will attend in-house Records Maintenance and Disposition Train-
ing.
7. Functional Area Records Managers. The commander or staff agency chief of each activity listed
below will appoint a primary and alternate FARM. Individuals appointed should have reasonable pros-
pects for one-year retainability at Minot AFB. Appointments will be accomplished by memorandum. The
FARMs will also be Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act Monitors for their organizations. An
example of the appointment is located in the FARM Program Handbook. The memorandum will contain
the individual’s office symbol, duty phone, e-mail address, and whether the individuals have or have not
received Records Maintenance and Disposition Classroom Training. A copy of the FARM’s RM CBT
certificates must be attached to the FARM appointment letter. A replacement FARM will be appointed
within 10 days after departure of the previous FARM. FARMs should be at the squadron, group, or staff
agency level, be a Client Support Administrator (CSA) or have the support of a unit CSA, and be an office
of record.

7.4. FARMs will perform a SAV on each office of record within their area of responsibility every 24
months at approximately 9 to 12 months following the RM visit. FARMs will maintain a FARM Program
Handbook as issued to each FARM by the RM. The handbook will contain only the information listed at
the table of contents.
7.8. (Added) FARMS will: Review unit publications for records management and PA requirements and
help the CORs and RCs in preparing AF Form 525, Records Disposition Recommendation, for newly
established records. Identify and provide assistance to offices who maintain records but are not estab-
lished as an office of record. Ensure RCs prepare file plans in AF-RIMS. Review Records Management
SAV reports and follow-up on discrepancies identified in the SAV reports. Coordinate on SFs 135,
Records Transmittal and Receipt, by signing in block 2 before sending to the RM.
8. Chief of the Office of Record (COR). The office of record will notify 5 CS/SCSR of a newly
assigned COR through the FARM by memorandum. Notification will be within 10 days of assignment.
9. Records Custodian (RC). Individuals appointed as RCs must have reasonable prospects for one-year
retainability at Minot AFB. Appoint a records custodian NLT 10 days after departure of the previous cus-
todian. Use Minot Form 19, Records Management Actions, signed by the COR to appoint a RC and delete
or add an office of record, report/request training, and appointment date. Three copies are required; one
for the office of record, one for the FARM, and original for Records Management. An alternate RC will
not be appointed at Minot AFB; however, offices of record can internally designate additional RM trained
personnel to assist the RC with filing. The Minot Form 19 is an electronic form and may be obtained from
the Minot AFB publications and forms webpage through the AF Portal.
9.7. (Added) Form Prescribed. Minot Form 19, Records Management Actions (paragraph 9.).
