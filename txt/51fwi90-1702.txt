4. General Base Utility Conservation Initiatives
    4.1. Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC). Efficient and appropriate use of air
    conditioning and heating systems is critical to the base’s energy conservation goals.
    Implementing the following procedures will maintain quality of life while reducing energy
    costs by providing “No Heat/No Cool” periods that minimize annual electricity and fuel
    consumption, and prepare equipment for peak operational efficiency.
         4.1.1. Cooling. Air conditioning systems used for comfort cooling will be turned on
         when directed by the 51 FW/CC, or when daily high temperatures reach or exceed 80
         degrees Fahrenheit for five consecutive days. Facility and stand-alone indoor air
         conditioning systems, will be turned off after 15 September each year, if daily high
         temperatures are below 80 degrees Fahrenheit for five consecutive days. This effort will
         mark the beginning of the “No Heat/No Cool” period during the fall season. Facilities
         utilizing window air conditioners and indoor tower air conditioners, will follow operation
         criteria as stated for facility air conditioning. The cooling temperature setting limits in
         Table 4.1 will apply to all base activities.

       4.1.2. Heating. Facility heating systems will be turned on, when directed by the 51
       FW/CC, no sooner than 15 October and usually only after daily low temperatures are
       below 40 degrees Fahrenheit for five consecutive days. Facility heating systems will be
       turned off after 1 April each year, if daily low temperatures are above 40 degrees
       Fahrenheit for five consecutive days. This effort will mark the beginning of the “No
       Heat/No Cool” period during the spring season. The heating temperature setting limits in
       Table 4.1 will apply to all base activities.
           4.1.2.1. With the exception of areas requiring 24 hour operation, heating systems will
           be set no higher than 55°F on weekends, holidays, and during non-business hours on
           duty days as practicable.
       4.1.3. Exceptions to HVAC Policy. The 51 CES Operations Flight Superintendent or
       delegate will coordinate with the 51 FSS prior to turning air conditioning off each year to
       evaluate extending air conditioning operation in community facilities (clubs, base theater,
       etc.) scheduled for near-term special events with large attendance, such as the annual Air
       Force Ball, DV mass briefings, and Dining-Ins. Other organizations requiring extended
       air conditioning operation will work through their chain of command to submit requests
       to 51 CES/CC with justification. Requests must be endorsed by a Squadron Commander
       or higher.
    4.2. Lighting. Interior lighting will be turned off while the area is unoccupied with the
