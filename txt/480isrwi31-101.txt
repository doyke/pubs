1. RESPONSIBILITIES.
   1.1. The Wing Chief of Security (480 ISR WG/SO) will provide oversight for the inspection
   program and is responsible for guidance and procedures outlined in this instruction.
   1.2. 480 ISR WG Security Personnel will:
 2                                                      480ISRWI31-101 7 FEBRUARY 2011


        1.2.1. Implement the guidance and procedures in this instruction.
        1.2.2. Comply with guidance and procedures in this instruction when conducting these
        SCIF entry and exit inspections.
        1.2.3. Conduct SCIF entry and exit inspections on randomly selected personnel (visitors
        or permanently assigned) entering or exiting building 23 during a randomly selected time
        period.
     1.3. 497 ISR GP (497 ISR GP/SO) security personnel will:
        1.3.1. Implement the guidance and procedures in this instruction.
        1.3.2. Comply with guidance and procedures in this instruction when conducting these

        1.3.3. Conduct SCIF entry and exit inspections on randomly selected personnel (visitors
        or permanently assigned) entering or exiting building 1302 during randomly selected
        time periods.
2. PURPOSE. The purpose of these inspections is to deter the introduction of prohibited items
and contraband into the SCIF and to deter and discover the unauthorized removal of classified
material from the SCIF. All hand-carried items are subject to inspection as part of these
inspections. Members entering could be asked to empty contents of their pockets.
3. PROCEDURES.
     3.1. To implement random inspections, the 480th ISR WG/SO and 497th ISR GP/SO can
     choose any website or program that generate random dates and times. At a minimum, 25
     personnel will be inspected at varying times throughout the day and night.
     3.2. Signs will be posted at SCIF entrances in buildings 23 and 1302 advising all personnel
     of the potential for inspection of all hand-carried items (to include but not limited to;
     backpacks, purses, day runners, etc.).
     3.3. 480th ISR WG/SO and 497th ISR GP/SO will maintain the Random SCIF Entry/Exit
     Inspection Log for 1 year (see Attachment 2). Periodic reviews of the logs will be
     conducted for trends of repeat violators.
     3.4. SCIF Entry Inspections:
        3.4.1. Entry inspections can be conducted at any SCIF entrance. During SCIF entry
        inspections, the personnel conducting the inspection will identify themselves to the
        selected individual, inform them of the requirement to conduct a random SCIF entry
        inspection, and ask that individual if they are carrying unauthorized items listed on the
        Wing Prohibited Items List.
            3.4.1.1. The Prohibited Items List include transmitting devices such as cellular
            telephones, 2-way pagers; "Bricks"/2-way Radios; recording devices; photographic
            equipment; laptop computers; palm pilots; electronic personal organizers; thumb
            drives and MP-3/IPOD players.
        3.4.2. The personnel conducting the inspection will ask the individual to open and
        remove all objects from their hand-carried item(s) for a visual inspection. At NO time
        will the personnel conducting the inspection put their hands on or in a hand-carried item.
480ISRWI31-101 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                 3


         3.4.2.1. If a prohibited item is found during the inspection, 480th ISR WG/SO and
         497th ISR GP/SO personnel will ensure the item does not enter the SCIF. SCIF
         access is denied until the individual removes the prohibited item from the area. 480th
         ISR WG/SO and 497th ISR GP/SO personnel will annotate the inspection log
         indicating what type of item was found.
         3.4.2.2. Military personnel who refuse to comply with the entry inspection will be
         denied access and may be subjected to administrative or punitive actions under the
         Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Contact 633 Air Base Wing/Judge
         Advocate (ABW/JA) for further guidance.
         3.4.2.3. Any civilian (Government, Contractor, Visitors) who refuses to comply with
         the entry inspection will be denied access. Any civilian who refuses to comply with
         the entry inspection should be reminded that consent was implied to the inspection
         upon SCIF entry and that refusal to submit to an inspection may result in being barred
         from the facility. Additionally, any civilian who refuses to submit to the entry
         inspection may be subject to being barred from the facility, civilian personnel action,
         and suspension of their security clearance. Contact 633 ABW/JA for further
         guidance.
  3.5. SCIF Exit Inspections:
     3.5.1. SCIF entry and exit inspections are the same as detailed in paragraph 3.4., except
     security personnel are also looking for unauthorized classified material. Prohibited items
     found during an inspection will be logged and the individual briefed on keeping those
     items out of the SCIF. If an individual is found carrying a prohibited video or audio
     recording device, that device will be retained and given to the 27 IS/SCBS or 10
     IS/SCXS flight to be analyzed for classified information prior to being released to the
     offending individual.
         3.5.1.1. Any prohibited device requiring technical analysis will be forwarded to the
         appropriate agency by the 27 IS/SCBS flight. In these cases 480th ISR WG/SO and
         497th ISRG GP/SO personnel will seize the device and turn it over the 27 IS/SCXS
         or 10 IS/SCBS.
         3.5.1.2. If SCI classified material is found during an exit inspection and personnel are
         leaving the building, 480th ISR WG/SO and 497th ISR GP/SO personnel will ask the
         individual for their Courier Authorization. Personnel not in possession of their
         Courier Authorization will be detained and their Commander and 633rd Security
         Forces will be notified. Collateral Secret and Confidential material does not require a
         courier card unless going off base. Personnel performing the inspections will
         ascertain if a package contain classified material, where the package is being shipped,
         and ensure that the material is properly packaged. Every effort will be made to
         confirm the ending destination.
         3.5.1.3. Military personnel who refuse to comply with the exit inspection will be
         detained and may be subjected to administrative or punitive actions under the
         Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Contact 633 ABW/JA for further
         guidance.

          3.5.1.4. Any civilian (Government, Contractor, Visitors) who refuses to comply with
          the exit inspection should be reminded that consent was implied to the inspection
          upon SCIF entry and that refusal to submit to an inspection may result in being barred
          from the facility, civilian personnel action, and suspension of their security clearance.
          Civilians (Government, Contractor, Visitors) that unlawfully possess classified
          information or material from the SCIF may be prosecuted under Title 18, United
          States Code, Chapter 37 and/or Title 18, United States Code, Section 1924. Contact
          633 ABW/JA for further guidance.
