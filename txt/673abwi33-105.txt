SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
version incorporates newer guidance and procedures of audio/visual support from 3WGI 33-104
with the creation of the new 673 Air Base Wing.
1. Role/Responsibilities:
     1.1. The 673 CS/Radio Frequency (RF) Transmissions Systems (673 CS/SCOT):
        1.1.1. The primary mission of the 673 CS/SCOT is to maintain radio communications
        systems in direct support of JBER and national partner missions. Mission system outages
        take precedence/priority over any requested Audio/Visual (A/V) support.
        1.1.2. Supported Events:
           1.1.2.1. Direct Support (673 CS/SCOT will set-up and operate).
               1.1.2.1.1. Retirement ceremonies for individuals in the rank of CMSgt, Colonel
               and above.
               1.1.2.1.2. Change of Command ceremonies for Group level and above.
               1.1.2.1.3. Any other official function authorized by the 673 ABW leadership.
               Requesting organization must provide the 673 ABW/CV or 673 ABW/CD
               concurrence at the time the request for support is being requested.
           1.1.2.2. Indirect Support (Customer set-up and operate). Depending on equipment
           availability, the 673 CS/SCOT will sign-out portable audio systems to support other
           official events not specified in paragraph 1.1.2.1, this instruction.
           1.1.2.3. Will maintain A/V equipment in the JBER-E Theater and provide technical
           support for official or approved events. This support encompasses training the user
           on self-help A/V equipment operations without 673 CS/SCOT support on-hand at the
           time of the event. The customer must first reserve the theater and then coordinate
           A/V equipment utilization training through 673 CS/SCOT.
           1.1.2.4. Will provide official military music pertaining to all branches of military
           service. This includes, but is not limited to cadence/marching music, Ruffles and
           Flourishes, The Star Spangled Banner, and songs from respective military branches.
           1.1.2.5. The use of appropriated funded communications equipment is limited by AFI
           65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) and
           Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIS).
        1.1.3. Will not be tasked to operate fixed A/V systems belonging to another unit, unless
        approved in writing by the 673 CS/CC.
        1.1.4. Will not be tasked to operate systems off-site of military installations unless
        approved in writing by the 673 ABW/CV or 673 ABW/CD.
        1.1.5. Reserves the right to deny or cancel A/V requests or remove equipment from
        operation if the safety of personnel or equipment is at risk.
        1.1.6. Will not provide disc jockey services.

          spanning a continuous four week period. This calendar will be updated continuously
          enabling 673 CS/ SCOT full access to view upcoming events so adequate manpower
          and support requirements can be determined.
   1.2. The Customer:
      1.2.1. Will complete the request documentation in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3.
      1.2.2. Will be responsible for reserving the facility where A/V equipment will be used
      ensuring adequate time is available for equipment set-up prior to the event. It is the
      customer’s responsibility to maintain physical control the facility reserved. The 673
      CS/SCOT will not assume control and must have full access to the facility in order to
      remove the equipment in its entirety.
      1.2.3. Will ensure coordination for the use of fixed A/V systems are routed through the
      appropriate responsible agencies.

   2.3. Short notice A/V requests require the requesting organization to submit a Public
   Address Request Form as outlined in paragraph 2.1., this instruction, which also must be
   endorsed by the requester’s Squadron Commander or above.
