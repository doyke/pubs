demolition pay by HQ AETC/A7C. These individuals must make arrangements to meet demolition duty
pay qualification requirements and establish a local tracking system to ensure compliance with the intent
of the applicable volume of DoD 7000.14-R. HQ AETC/A7COX will certify demolition requirements
have been met.

support missions of other MAJCOMs or sister services as far in advance of the mission as possible.
3.5.8.3. (Added) The command EOD manager is the primary point of command (POC) for

availability for use by USNORTHCOM EODVIPPSA for team assignments. Each flight will have
accurate contact information and pin and/or placard inventories available on the ACES-EOD
information page for their flight.
3.5.8.3.3. (Added) Units will document destruction of EOD credentials and maintain documentation
according to AFRIMS, Table 31-4, Rule 13, Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, located at

are clearly defined, and EOD training requirements are met.
3.10.4.4. (Added) Ensure demolition qualification is included in Group I training for assigned personnel.
3.10.4.5. (Added) Ensure training is a top priority within the EOD flight, exceeded only by emergency
responses and EOD operations. EOD training is a priority equal to the normal day-to-day workload
activities of other organizations.
3.10.4.6. (Added) Ensure the emphasis, scope, and depth of training for each subject is determined based
on the subject’s relationship to the flight’s mission and the level of knowledge and understanding of
individuals assigned.
3.10.4.7. (Added) Place increased emphasis on practical training versus classroom training. Training
will include all applications of EOD tools and equipment.

qualify an individual for standby duty within 90 days of assignment.
3.10.4.9. (Added) Training and certification on weapons systems not available at home station will
require TDY travel to a site where the training can be accomplished. If an EOD team is unable to travel
TDY to receive their required training, send a request for assistance to HQ AETC/A7COX; ensure
request contains justification and is signed by the squadron commander.
3.10.4.10. (Added) HQ AETC/IG personnel will use established standards when conducting evaluations.
Simulations will be kept to the absolute minimum. Any actions not performed during the exercise should
be demonstrated afterward at the request of the evaluator. Ultimately it is the flight chief’s responsibility

except for semiannual and annual exercises.
3.18.2. AETC EOD flights should maintain a file of FBI Bomb Data Center (BDC) publications or have
access to them through a law enforcement online (LEO) account. Flight chiefs will determine which
publications will be kept and for how long in addition to the need for having these accounts active.
4.2.2. The flight chief reports any excess equipment to HQ AETC/A7COX for possible redistribution to
other units.
4.3. (Added) Munitions. Coordinate each out-of-cycle (OOC) munitions allocation request with the
base munitions operations or munitions accountable systems officer (MASO) prior to submitting it to
HQ AETC/A7COX with justification.

and provide, at a minimum, the emergency services contact numbers, base and/or installation maps, after
duty hours contact information, etc.
9.4. Quality Assurance (QA). The purpose of the AETC QA program is to validate the effectiveness of
the flight’s training program and ensure EOD craftsmen maintain the highest level of proficiency to
fulfill the operational requirements of the command. These EOD evaluations are designed to give the
BCE and EOD flight leadership feedback on the operational capabilities of the EOD flight.
9.4.1. (Added) Team operational evaluations are practical evaluations performed at least yearly and may
be accomplished during team training exercises or wing exercises. The following team operational
evaluations will be conducted as outlined in Attachment 5 (Added):

evaluation requirement for operational team evaluations.
9.4.2. (Added) Use scenarios with sufficient depth and detail to ensure technical competence, equipment
availability, and current technical data are used. Scenarios will be as realistic as possible and encompass
possible situations that could be encountered in both war and peacetime.
9.4.3. (Added) The following evaluation ratings are recommended for use by evaluators:
9.4.3.1. (Added) Pass. Successful accomplishment with no equipment or technical data deficiencies that
precluded completion of the operation.
9.4.3.2. (Added) Fail. Units will receive this rating if a team:
9.4.3.2.1. (Added) Commits a major safety error. Note: A major safety error is one that could reasonably
be assumed would have initiated the device or resulted in the loss of life or major property damage.
9.4.3.2.2. (Added) Commits two or more minor safety errors. Note: A minor safety error is one that
could reasonably be assumed would cause injury or property damage.

Review of Quality Control Reports. Annotate findings and recommendations on AF Form 2420, Quality
Control Inspection Summary. Note: Locally approved products by the base publishing function are
permitted as long as they fulfill the same purpose as AF Forms 2419 and 2420.
9.4.6. (Added) Route team evaluation results from the evaluator through the team or section chief and
flight leader. To elevate problem resolution, route functional area inspections through the base civil
engineer (BCE) as necessary.
