This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-28, Awards and Decorations Pro-
gram, and AFPD 36-10, Civilian Performance Management. It provides guidelines for the nomination
and selection of outstanding enlisted personnel, company grade officers and civilian employees of the
Quarter/Year. It applies to all personnel assigned or attached to the 31st Fighter Wing (FW). Maintain and
dispose of resulting records in accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and the Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule located in Air Force Records Information Management (AFRIMs) at
https://afrims.amc.af.mil. Protect resulting personal information, including temporary collections, in
accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision deletes geographically separated units (GSU) nomination requirements (para 3.4.) and
expands civilian personnel categories from two to four categories (quarterly boards only) (paras 3.2.6. -
3.2.9.). USAFE IMT 889, Nomination Evaluation Records, and USAFE IMT 892, Nomination Evalua-
tion Summary, are prescribed forms used for board scoring (Attachment 2 - Attachment 3). The wing
quarterly awards breakfast is changed to an awards luncheon (Attachment 6). Nomination packages sub-
mitted to 31 FW/CCEA and 31 MSS/DPCS are now electronic packages only (paras 3.4.4. - 3.4.5.). The
suspense dates for small unit and group nomination packages are established as the first Monday and sec-
ond Monday, respectively, following the end of the awards quarter (Attachment 6). Board composition
for each quarter is established by group/small unit; annual boards is changed to 5 board members (1 rep-
resentative from each group) (Attachment 9).

program is not a substitute for other Air Force awards. It is primarily an incentive program to recognize

                         BOARD MEMBERS’ GUIDE TO EVALUATIONS
GENERAL: As a member of a selection board, you have accepted the challenging task to determine the
“best of the best.” It requires complete honesty and objectivity on your part. The selection of individuals
to represent the 31st Fighter Wing as outstanding Airmen, NCOs, SNCOs, and CGOs will be based on the
evaluation of the written nomination.


a. Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty: Consider nominee’s leadership and job perfor-
mance on increasing mission effectiveness. What kind of IMPACT did the member have on the squadron
(i.e., the development of new techniques, processes, etc., and the results of such)? How did the nominee’s
acceptance of responsibilities commensurate with grade and/or position compare?
b. Significant Self-Improvement: What significant self-improvement was demonstrated? (Training,
off-duty education, achievements in professional or cultural organizations, development of creative abili-
ties, professional military education, CCAF, etc.).
c. Base or Community Involvement: What was the scope and impact of the member’s positive leader-
ship and involvement in both the military and civilian community (i.e., include leadership, membership,
or participation in unit advisory councils, professional military organization, associations, and events;
President of Top 3, enlisted dining-out committee, Air Force Sergeants Association member, Sunday
school teacher, and so forth.)


EVALUATION TIPS:
a. Be objective: Base your evaluation on only the information presented, not on your personal knowledge
or opinion. DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, adjust the data provided in the packages
according to your personal knowledge. If something is missing or incorrect, grade accordingly.
b. Apply the full range/weight of points across the entire nomination package: If a member is a higher
headquarters award winner or makes a major impact in the squadron, grade that higher than if someone
received a letter of appreciation or simply accomplished his daily job. Even though there is a tendency to
score in the middle, your scores should probably reflect the full scale, some high, some low, and some
in-between.
c. Be consistent throughout: Some evaluators will be “lenient,” others “tough.” As long as you are con-
sistent, the results will be the same. Don’t change your philosophy halfway through the evaluation pro-
cess.
