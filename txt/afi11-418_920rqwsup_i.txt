1. General. The basic supervision structure for flying operations consists of the Operations
Group Commander (OG/ CC), the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and the squadron supervisors, i.e.,
Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup) and Stand-by Duty Officer (SDO). The chain of supervision
begins with the OG/CC, through the SOF, down to the individual squadron supervisors. Specific
duties and responsibilities of each are defined later in this instruction. Paragraph 3 specifies the
requirements for each position. NOTE: For the purpose of this instruction “experienced”
(aircrew) is used in accordance with (IAW) the definition specified in the Mission Design Series
(MDS) specific AFI 11-2 MDS Volume 1. Aircrews are also considered “experienced” when
previously rated “experienced” in another MDS or previously rated “experienced” in a different
crew position in the same MDS, are selected by the Squadron CC and approved by the OG/CC.
Where no definition is provided, “experienced” will be determined by the unit squadron
commander and approved by OG/CC.
1. (920RQW) General. The squadron Ops Sup is responsible to the 920th Operations Group
Commander (OG/CC) and flying squadron Commander (CC) and Director of Operations (DO)
for monitoring all phases of flying and for administering activities specified in AFI 11-418. The
squadron Ops Sup is below the OG/CC (and if available the flying squadron CC and DO) in the
chain of supervision and has the authority to direct appropriate actions, on behalf of the OG/CC
or flying squadron CC or DO, to prevent unsafe situations and to otherwise support safe and
efficient conduct of flight operations.
2. Operations Supervision Functions:
     2.1. Supervisor of Flying. When on duty, the SOF is a group-level position and is the direct
     representative of the OG/CC. The SOF is the focal point for command and control of flight
     operations. Decision authority is delegated to this position to accomplish the mission.
     NOTES:
     1. SOF is not required for rescue/weather/electronic attack/airlift/air refueling/RC-26
     operations/ special operations/deployed U-2 Ops.
     2. ANG/AFRC may combine SOF and Ops Sup duties.
     3. DELETED.
     2.2. Operations Supervisor. The squadron Ops Sup must be filled by the squadron operations
     officer, assistant operations officer, flight commanders, or other individuals deemed qualified
     by the squadron commander and approved by the OG/CC.
ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or Air Operations Officer (AOO) will determine requirements for Ops Sup
and will determine the appropriate personnel to fill the Ops Sup position.
     2.2. (920RQW) Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup). The squadron Ops Sup position will be
     filled by the squadron DO, assistant operations officers (ADO), and highly qualified rated
     officers with proven maturity, judgment, and supervisory ability. These rated officers will be
     deemed qualified by the squadron commander and approved in writing by the OG/CC.
        2.2.1. Squadron commanders can always fill the Ops Sup position, if available.
        2.2.1. (920RQW) When flying operations are being conducted by the 308 RQS with
        920 RQW aircraft/aircrew (training or operational), Operations Supervision command
        and control will be coordinated through the flying units Ops Sup. The 308 RQS SDO
AFI11-418_920RQWSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2009                                                           5


       will be responsible for supervision of all squadron operations. The Ops Sup will have
       contact numbers for the 308 RQS SDO for notification of any accident/incident or
       unusual circumstances. For any other training or operational events (i.e., non-flying
       events or flying with non-920 RQW aircraft/aircrew) the team commander (TC) or team
       leader (TL) will be responsible for contacting the SDO directly whenever a mission
       change or unusual circumstance occurs. The TC/TL will also contact the SDO at the
       termination of events for the day.
       2.2.2. During local flying operations, an Ops Sup will always be immediately available
       to the OG/ CC, the SOF, command and control (C2) personnel or other supporting
       agencies to respond to any current operations issues requiring time-sensitive answers,
       decisions and actions.
       2.2.3. For Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) tasked missions, AFRC units require an
       Ops Sup for home station departure and arrival.
   2.3. Stand-by Duty Officer (SDO). The SDO is an experienced squadron member,
   designated by the squadron operations officer, who has the authority to make operations-
   related decisions and recommendations. The SDO is necessary when the squadron has on-
   going off-station operations. These operations include sorties that do not otherwise qualify as
   deployed sorties. When on duty, the SDO will be available to the OG/CC, the SOF, C2
   personnel and other supporting agencies to respond to squadron operations issues. For
   operations where the SOF is not qualified to provide technical assistance to the type of
   aircraft airborne and an Ops Sup is not readily available, the SDO will assist the SOF as
   required
   2.3. (920RQW) SDO duties are accomplished by an Ops Sup qualified officer designated
   by the squadron operations officer when the flying squadron has on-going off-station
   operations but no local flying operations. The SDO will assist off-station crews as required.
       2.3.1. (Added-920RQW) 308 RQS SDO duties will normally be the responsibility of
       the CC or DO. Other SDO candidates will be recommended by the director of operations
       and appointed by the squadron commander. SDO candidates will complete the 308 RQS
       SDO training program prior to certification. If no SDOs are available, the DO can
       appoint another well qualified individual to perform SDO duties for a temporary basis,
       after receiving the proper training. Each SDO will have a copy of the 308 RQS Quick-
       Reaction Checklist (QRC) with them during off-duty hours if there are operations
       scheduled. The SDO will be reachable by phone and be able to return to base within 2
       hours. The QRC will consist of contact numbers and procedures to follow in the event of
       accidents/incidents or other unusual circumstances.
3. Supervision of Flying Operations. All levels of flight operations may not require each
supervisory position to be manned. With the exception of scramble (Active Duty), some type of
squadron-level supervisor is always required (Ops Sup/SDO), but other factors enter into the
decision if the group-level SOF position should be manned. Table 1 outlines the minimum
supervision requirements.

   3.1. Types of Operations. Classifying types and levels of flight activity is the basis for
   designating minimum supervision requirements. The definitions for types of operations that
   are used in Table 1 are:
      3.1.1. Daily Flying Operations. Normal or surge operations at the unit's home station
      (this does not include other types of operations defined below).
      3.1.2. Reduced Flying Operations. Operations, scheduled or unscheduled, that occur
      when majority of the unit is not flying. Under these conditions, OG/CC may direct that
      the group-level SOF position is not required.
      3.1.3. On-Going Off Station Sorties. Missions/sorties that do not takeoff or land at home
      station.
      3.1.4. Out of Local Area Operations. Missions that take off and land at home base but
      operate outside the local area for extended periods of time. These missions usually have
      primary emergency landing fields other than home base.
      3.1.5. Deployment/Re-deployment. The departure from home station to another location
      or return to home station from another location.
      3.1.6. Deployed Operations. Flight operations away from home station that are part of a
      deployment, exercise or contingency.
      3.1.7. Cross Country Departures/Returns. Aircraft departing from or returning to home
      station for other than a deployment, exercise or contingency.
      3.1.8. Functional Check Flight. Aircraft launched to ensure it is airworthy and capable of
      accomplishing its mission.
      3.1.9. Scrambles. Aircraft launched on a scramble order from an alert posture.
      3.1.10. TACC Missions. Missions flown with OPCON by the Tanker Airlift Control
      Center (TACC).
   3.2. Minimum Supervision Requirements. These are outlined in Table 1 for each type of
   operation. The OG/CC may impose additional requirements depending on local
   circumstances.
      3.2.1. (Added-920RQW) During normal duty hours or on Unit Training Assembly
      (UTA) weekends, the squadron commander or operations officer is the primary
      supervisor for unit flying. The squadron Ops Sup assumes specified duties after normal
      duty hours or when specified by the unit commander or operations officer to act in his or
      her absence. A squadron Ops Sup may be appointed by the squadron commander or
      operations officer to serve during normal duty hours. In this case the chain of supervision
      flows up from the squadron Ops Sup through the squadron commander or operations
      officer to the 920 OG/CC.
4. Responsibilities of Supervisors: NOTE: For the purposes of this instruction, the term
“operations group commander” also refers to the designated representative.
   4.1. OG/CC (ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or AOO) will:
      4.1.1. Be responsible for the implementation, direction and execution of the Operations
      Supervision program.
8                                             AFI11-418_920RQWSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2009


       4.1.1. (920RQW) 920 OG/CC will be responsible for the implementation, direction, and
       execution of the Ops Sup program for both the 39 RQS and 301 RQS. 920th Operations
       Group Standardization and Evaluation (OG/OGV) and flying squadron Standardization
       and Evaluation (DOV) offices will assist the OG/CC in Ops Sup program management
       administrative actions.
       4.1.2. Be immediately available to the SOF or Ops Sup for consultation during daily
       flying operations.
       4.1.3. Ensure tenant flying units use host/tenant memorandum of agreement
       (MOA)/letter of agreement (LOA) to avoid duplication of effort, where appropriate.
       4.1.4. Be the final approval authority for unit supplement to this instruction.
    4.2. SOF will:
       4.2.1. Be on duty when required by Table 1 or when directed by the OG/CC.
       4.2.2. Be responsible to the OG/CC for monitoring and supervising all phases of unit
       flying operations and will provide guidance, advice, assistance and recommendations to
       aircrews, supervisors, command and control personnel and support agencies regarding the
       safe and efficient conduct of flight operations.
           4.2.2.1. While aircraft commanders are ultimately responsible for the safe operation
           of their aircraft, the SOF will ensure that in-flight emergency (IFE) recovery plans
           and weather related mission changes reflect sound airmanship, follow AFI and
           technical order guidance, and “pass the common sense check.”
       4.2.3. Remember that safety is the first priority. If safety is an issue, the SOF has the
       authority to direct appropriate actions, on behalf of the OG/CC, to correct/prevent unsafe
       situations. This includes the use of any and all resources to include radios, FM nets,
       telephone hot lines and all wing-flying operations on the ground or in the air.
       4.2.4. Prior to the first launch, ensure the airfield status is suitable for safe operations
       IAW Air Force, major command (MAJCOM) and local directives.
       4.2.5. During an emergency or an abnormal situation, provide aircrews with guidance,
       timely advice and assistance to determine a correct course of action to safely recover the
       aircraft.
       4.2.6. Be in a position to visually monitor the final approach and landing of IFE aircraft.
       If unable, the SOF will direct another highly qualified aircrew member to be in position
       to monitor the landing and provide needed assistance or guidance. (ANG/AFRC: Not
       required.)
       4.2.7. Closely monitor the status of primary and emergency airfields and inform aircrews
       of changes that may affect flight operations.
AFI11-418_920RQWSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2009                                                           9


     4.2.8. When deteriorating weather conditions affect flying operations, coordinate with
     wing agencies and utilize all available resources (i.e., weather, radar, tower personnel,
     pilot reports, etc.) to determine the best course of action for wing aircraft. This course of
     action could extend to departures and recoveries as well as diverts or SOF directed
     holding. The SOF will determine suitable weather alternates, assign them accordingly
     and monitor them. When necessary to ensure safe flight operations, the SOF will
     coordinate with the air traffic control (ATC) watch supervisor or senior controller for
     runway changes.
     4.2.9. Prepare a daily log tracking major events, with format and content as defined by
     unit supplement. The SOF will debrief the OG/CC and the applicable squadron
     commander of any aircraft involved in an unusual situation, IFE, weather divert or other
     mission change requiring SOF action or intervention.
  4.3. Ops Sup will:
     4.3.1. Be on duty when required by Table 1 and be present in the squadron when
     required in the performance of the duties listed below.
     4.3.2. Be immediately available to assist the SOF or aircrew (for units which do not
     require a SOF).
     4.3.3. When the SOF is not qualified in the distressed aircraft or the unit does not require
     a SOF, be the primary source of technical assistance.
     4.3.4. For situations where the SOF and Ops Sup are not qualified to provide technical
     assistance to the type of aircraft airborne, schedule an instructor or experienced
     crewmember to be immediately available for aircraft technical assistance.
     4.3.5. Ensure the SOF is advised of any changes or deviations to the squadron's flying
     schedule.
     4.3.6. Be responsible for the execution of the daily flying schedule and coordinate any
     mission changes as required. Ensure that the actual mission flown is accurately annotated
     on the flying schedule.
         4.3.6.1. Be assisted by SARM personnel or a duty officer as required.
     4.3.7. Ensure crews are briefed on aircraft and airfield status, aircraft configuration,
     scheduled and available airspace and weather.
     4.3.8. Manage aircraft tail number changes, crew swaps, flight-plan and airspace
     changes.
     4.3.9. Ensure electronic scheduling and tracking systems are updated to include changes
     to and deviations from the daily flying schedule.
         4.3.9.1. Prepare, at squadron commander’s discretion, a daily operations log to aid in
         tracking daily operations. For missions where a SOF is not required, this log will be
         prepared by Ops Sup or SDO. Log format and content will be defined by unit
         supplement. NOTE: Mission commanders/flight leads are required to coordinate
         with Operations Supervisor/Top 3 prior to the flight brief when intended sortie type,
         profile, airspace, and/or aircraft configuration do not match the approved schedule.
10                                       AFI11-418_920RQWSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2009

     4.3.27. (Added-920RQW) In the case of going from two flying lines to one, adjust crew
     compliment to maximize training.
     4.3.28. (Added-920RQW) Ops Sup should not increase the total number of
     crewmembers on any mission without valid justification (training to be accomplished,
     currency, etc.).
     4.3.29. (Added-920RQW) Ops Sup should consult with the Instructor Pilot (IP) or
     Aircraft Commander (AC) of the remaining flying line to ensure desired training can be
     accomplished within the time allotted or with the assets available.
     4.3.30. (Added-920RQW) Is authorized to change names of crewmembers, based on
     crewmember non-availability, in the absence of the CC, DO, or ADO.
     4.3.31. (Added-920RQW) Assume duties of current operations when that office is
     unmanned (real time actions only).
     4.3.32. (Added-920RQW) Authorize Additional Ground Training Periods (AGTPs)
     when aircrew are unable to takeoff by end of first AFTP period and training dictates
     mission be launched.
     4.3.33. (Added-920RQW) Cancel the flying line if the aircraft is not released     from
     maintenance to the crew in time to facilitate a takeoff no later than two hours   after
     scheduled takeoff time. The aircraft commander together with the Ops Sup           may
     coordinate exceptions to this policy when circumstances (evaluation, customer,     etc.)
     dictate that mission be flown with minimal flying time.
     4.3.34. (DELETED-920RQW)

5. Responsibilities of Other Key Unit Personnel:
   5.1. Wing/unit commanders are responsible for an effective Operations Supervision program
   for all assigned and attached units and ensure other group commanders support the OG/CC
   when and where needed in order to execute an effective program.
   5.2. Mission Support group commanders are responsible for the maintenance, upgrade and
   repair of the applicable SOF facilities and equipment.
   5.3. Mission Support group/Logistic Readiness group commanders are responsible for
   maintenance, upgrade and repair of the SOF vehicle.
   5.4. Squadron commanders ensure a SOF/Ops Sup/SDO is on duty when required by Table
   1.
   5.5. Command post is responsible for tracking all wing flying activities, both on and off
   station. It functions as the central source for information during an emergency. ANG/AFRC:
   Single squadron units and units with minimal command post full-time manning may establish
   procedures for unit SOF, Ops Sup, and duty desk personnel to track flying activities and be
   the central source for information during an emergency.
AFI11-418_920RQWSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2009                                                          13



6. Handling of In-Flight Emergencies:
   6.1. The primary objective during an abnormal/emergency situation is the safe recovery of
   the aircrew and aircraft. When establishing procedures, units will consider:
      6.1.1. Providing a single, discrete frequency for recovering an emergency aircraft. ATC
      and the emergency aircrew should determine when to use a single frequency approach
      (SFA). The SOF will have access to the SFA. The SFA should be available to
      crash/fire/rescue personnel to monitor the recovery.
      6.1.2. Using the command post, or other capable agency, to notify all appropriate
      agencies and key personnel of an IFE and provide situation updates, allowing the SOF or
      Ops Sup to devote full attention to the emergency.
      6.1.3. Prioritizing actions during concurrent emergencies/abnormal situations.
      6.1.4. Authorizing direct communications (over discrete SOF or squadron common
      frequency) from the Ops Sup/SDO to an IFE aircrew. Only ATC personnel may authorize
      direct communication over ATC frequencies, including the SFA frequency. However,
      this does not preclude the SOF from using whatever communication necessary, to include
      GUARD and SFA, to prevent an unsafe situation that could immediately jeopardize safe
      recovery.
      6.1.5. That only the on-scene commander, normally the fire chief, can terminate an
      emergency.
      6.1.6. That the final decision during any IFE/abnormal situation rests with the aircraft
      commander. However, SOFs may declare an IFE for any aircraft based on their
      knowledge of the aircraft and the flight and airfield environment.
      6.1.7. Obtaining a chase ship for single ship emergency aircraft if time permits.
      6.1.8. Directing the Ops Sup or other highly qualified individual to report to the SOF's
      duty location during an abnormal situation/recovery if time permits.
7. CONFERENCE HOTEL Aircraft Specific Procedures: NOTE: DELETED.
   7.1. These procedures make aircraft specialists accessible to the SOF or Ops Sup and
   aircrew when in-flight situations pose systems-related questions that cannot be answered at
   the local level. See Attachment 4 for specific MDS procedures.
   7.2. Table A4.1. shows the different MDSs and the MDS-specific reference paragraphs.
8. SOF/ATC Relationship:
   8.1. The relationship between supervisors and ATC must be based on professionalism, trust
   and teamwork. SOFs represent the OG/CC for the conduct of safe flight operations and
   mission accomplishment.
   8.2. The separation and sequencing of traffic are the responsibilities of the watch supervisors
   and controllers. Unless safety is an issue, the SOF will work directly with the watch
   supervisor. To promote effective and efficient flight operations, the SOF may suggest, based
 14                                         AFI11-418_920RQWSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2009


   on knowledge of the flying schedule and unique circumstances of individual missions,
   actions that affect ATC concerns or desires.
   8.3. Except in an emergency, the SOF will not transmit over ATC frequencies without prior
   coordination with ATC (this does not apply to dedicated SOF frequencies). All radio
   transmissions to a distressed aircrew, from other than the SOF or ATC, will be coordinated
   through the SOF.
9. Duty Hours:
   9.1. Prior to beginning supervisory duties, the SOF will meet crew rest requirements as
   directed by AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, as supplemented. For AFRC units, 12
   hours of crew rest is required prior to starting duty but may be waived by the OG/CC to 8
   hours on a case-by-case basis.
   9.2. Maximum duty day for SOF is 12 hours. Waiver authority for SOF duty day is OG/CC.
   For AFRC units, the maximum duty day for SOF is 16 hours and may not be waived.
   9.3. The SOF will be on duty in with sufficient time to complete required duties in
   paragraph 4.2 and will be in the primary or alternate duty location 30 minutes prior to first
   scheduled takeoff and remain on duty until the last aircraft is shut down.
   9.4. (AFRC/ANG) If Ops Sup and SOF duties are combined, SOF duty hour limitations
   apply.
   9.5. (Added-920RQW) Prior to beginning the duty day, an Ops Sup will have a minimum
   of eight hours rest.
   9.6. (Added-920RQW) The Ops Sup will arrive with ample time to accomplish the
   Opening/Changeover Checklist prior to the scheduled aircrew show time/brief time. This is
   normally one hour before the scheduled aircrew brief time. The Ops Sup will be released
   from duty upon completion of the Closing or Changeover Checklist. There is no maximum
   duty period.
10. SOF Duty Location:
   10.1. The OG/CC will designate primary and alternate SOF duty locations. As a minimum,
   the location must have adequate communication equipment and the capability to monitor
   weather conditions. It is desirable to have a SOF duty position from which ground
   operations, takeoffs, landings and local traffic patterns can be observed. The designated
   locations must provide the SOF with timely access to a SOF vehicle and the airfield when
   required. AFRC units are not required to have a dedicated vehicle for the SOF, but must be
   provided access to a vehicle to perform required duties in a timely manner.
   10.2. The primary SOF location for active duty bomber and fighter units will be in the
   control tower. The primary SOF location for all ACC flying units will be in the control tower
   (OG/CC may designate an alternate SOF duty location IAW this regulation). ANG/AFRC
   and smaller than wing-sized units will designate, in priority order, the SOF primary and
   alternate duty locations in their unit supplement to this instruction. Also see paragraph 16
   for ANG/AFRC and smaller than wing-sized units. Unless contained in the following list,
   SOF duty locations need an OG/CC waiver:
      10.2.1. The control tower.
AFI11-418_920RQWSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2009                                                      15


     10.2.2. The SOF vehicle on the airfield.
     10.2.3. The runway monitoring unit (RMU)/runway supervisory unit (RSU).
     10.2.4. The unit dispatch desk.
     10.2.5. The command post.
  10.3. (Added-920RQW) The 39 RQS Ops Sup primary duty location is the squadron
  rescue operations center (ROC), room 24, Bldg 673. The alternate locations in order of
  preference are the 301 RQS Ops Sup duty location in Bldg 619, the Patrick Command Post in
  Bldg 423, and the 920 Maintenance Operations Flight Maintenance Operations Center
  (MOC) in Bldg 750. All locations are on Patrick AFB.
