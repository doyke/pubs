This instruction implements AFI 91-202, The U.S. Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. It
provides guidance and responsibility in managing the base safety program. This instruction
applies to all organizations assigned to the 17th Training Wing and includes Geographically-
Separated Units (GSUs). It does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and to Air
National Guard (ANG) units. Tenant unit compliance is voluntary (due to requirement to follow
command/service specific standards) unless otherwise specified. Ensure all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained according to AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of according to the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims/cfm. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field
through the appropriate chain of command. This publication may be supplemented at any level,
but all direct Supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to
certification and approval.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change updates the AF Form used to report mishaps, clarifies the responsibilities of
the Risk Management Liaison, and provides clarification for 517 TRG responsibilities. A

specific duties of WSRs. In addition, WSRs will run a self-inspection checklist at least annually,
provide periodic safety briefings and educational material to affected personnel, and attend
USR/WSR quarterly meetings. WSRs and/or USRs should discuss the status of the explosive
safety program with the commander monthly.
7. Risk Management (RM) Liaison. Each squadron shall appoint a RM liaison in writing.

Documentation may be done on the AETC Form 4437, Deliberate Risk Assessment Worksheet,
or electronic document (i.e., Microsoft Word or Excel) which identifies hazards, assesses risks of
each hazard, identifies the controls used to mitigate each hazard (i.e., how to implement and who
will implement), and the residual risk level after mitigating actions for each hazard. For events
involving multiple units (i.e., wing events), the RM liaison or respective unit POC is responsible
for completing and coordinating a risk assessment, which addresses risks and mitigating actions
with the Wing Safety Office. For any event which is not covered at all by AFIs or adequately
detailed to address injury prevention (e.g., physical injury, heat stress), the unit POC or private
organization representative will conduct a risk assessment and define risk mitigation actions.
The RM liaison will maintain a continuity book which includes at least the following items noted
below. Electronic versions of the book are acceptable as long as the information is readily
accessible.
