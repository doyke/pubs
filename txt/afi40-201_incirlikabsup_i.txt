This instruction implements AFPD 40-2, Radioactive Materials (Non-Nuclear Weapons). It
applies to Department of Defense (DOD) personnel, Department of Energy (DOE) personnel,
DOE prime contractors, and other civilian contractors who bring radioactive materials onto or
use radioactive materials on any Air Force owned or leased property. It sets forth how Air Force
personnel or units manage (to include acquire, receive, use, store, transfer, transport, distribute,
and dispose of) all radioactive material not expressly excluded from the purview of the AFI.
This AFI also prescribes how non-Air Force activities get approval to use radioactive materials
on Air Force installations. Radioactive material covered by this instruction includes, without
limitation, byproduct, source, or special nuclear material, and naturally occurring or accelerator
produced radioactive materials that fall under the control of the US Air Force Radioisotope
Committee. This does not apply to nuclear reactor programs, nuclear weapon systems and fuel
and other material controlled under Section 91(a) or 91(b) of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA)
unless such are not covered by AFI 91-101, AF Nuclear Weapons Surety Program or AFI 91-
109, Air Force Nuclear Reactor Program or any other instruction managed by the Air Force
Safety Center (AFSC). The handling of waste from operations involving nuclear munitions

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change incorporates specific policy, instruction, and guidance on radiation safety
programs associated with current nuclear weapons maintenance operations, continental United
States (CONUS) legacy maintenance operations, other related nuclear weapons operations and
the management of other 91(b) material. Intrinsic radiation safety (INRAD) and the management
of mixed waste have been addressed. This change updates organizational changes that have
occurred since initial publication. Organizational office symbols are updated.

Unit designation changes:

―Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA)‖ has been updated to ―Air Force Medical
Support Agency (AFMSA)‖ and ―SGZR‖ has been updated to ―SG3PB.‖

―Air Force Institute of Environment, Safety, Occupational Health and Risk Analysis (AFIERA)‖
has been updated to ―United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM).‖

―Air Force Safety Agency (AFSA)‖ has been updated to ―Air Force Safety Center (AFSC).‖

―Air Force Radioactive Material Recovery and Recycling Office‖ has been updated to ―Air
Force Radioactive Recycling and Disposal (AFRRAD) Office.‖

―Radiation Protection Division‖ has been updated to ―Radiation Programs,‖ of which the
Radioisotope Committee Secretariat (RICS) is a function.

(INCIRLIKAB) This instruction has been revised and requires a complete review of all subject
matter. Complete changes include the Investigation Action Levels radiation; ensures how the
radiologic materials will be shipped; what document should be permitted within a binder; and to
ensure complete records are maintained of either measured or estimated radiation dose received
by personnel.

                                           Chapter 2

           REGULATORY AUTHORITY FOR RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS

2.1. NRC Regulatory Authority The Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended
(including the Energy Policy Act of 2005), and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (Public
Law 93-438) grants the NRC the authority to regulate by-product, source, and special nuclear
material. This authority does not extend to material described in section 91(a) and 91(b) of the
AEA.
   2.1.1. The NRC regulatory authority extends to the United States, its possessions and
   territories, and Puerto Rico. For regulations issued and enforced by the NRC, see Title 10,
   Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Parts 1 through 199.
   2.1.2. All Federal agencies are subject to compliance with the NRC.
   2.1.3. The NRC maintains regulatory authority over Federal Agency licensees regardless of
   location within the United States.
2.2. Air Force Regulatory Authority
   2.2.1. Authority for Air Force receipt, storage, internal distribution, use, transfer, and
   disposal of byproduct, source, and limited quantities of special nuclear material is granted
   through a Master Materials License issued to the Air Force by the NRC. This instruction
   prescribes requirements for Air Force compliance with the Master Materials License.
   2.2.2. Authority for Air Force production, receipt, storage, distribution, use, transfer, and
   disposal by Air Force organizations of Naturally Occurring or Accelerator Produced
   Radioactive Material (NARM) that is excluded from the definition of byproduct material is
   also covered under this instruction.
   2.2.3. The Air Force also maintains authority through this instruction over 1) the use of
   materials identified above by non-Air Force organizations on Air Force installations, and 2)
   material used at AF installations outside NRC jurisdiction.
   2.2.4. Authority for Air Force receipt, use, storage, distribution and disposal of 91(a) and
   91(b) material is covered under AFI 91-108, AFI 91-109, and AFI 91-110, Nuclear Safety
   Review and Launch Approval for Space or Missile Use of Radioactive Material and Nuclear
   Systems.
2.3. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) RCRA authorized EPA to develop
and enforce regulations governing the cradle to grave management of hazardous waste. These
regulations are found in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulation. Mixed waste is hazardous waste
that is also a radioactive material. As such, mixed waste is subject to dual regulation under EPA
and NRC rules.
   2.3.1. Solid low level radioactive wastes (LLRW) include quantities of byproduct, source
   and special nuclear material. They also may contain Naturally Occurring or Accelerator
   Produced Radioactive Material (NARM), and they may fall within the definition of
   hazardous wastes as set out in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1,
   Environmental Protection Agency, Part 261, Identification and Listing of Hazardous Waste
   (40 CFR 261).
28                                        AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010


     2.3.2. Wastes that contain both AEA-regulated radioactive materials and hazardous wastes
     (as defined by 40 CFR) are termed mixed waste.
        2.3.2.1. The NRC regulates the byproduct, source, and special nuclear material
        constituents.
        2.3.2.2. EPA regulates the hazardous chemical and non-NRC regulated constituents.
        2.3.2.3. Neither agency has exclusive jurisdiction over mixed waste under current
        Federal law1 .
        2.3.2.4. Generators of mixed waste must meet both NRC and EPA rules unless exempted
        by those rules. Refer to 40 CFR 261 and 266, subpart N, AFPD 32 -70, Environmental
        Quality; AFI 10-2501, Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) Planning And Operations;
        AFI 32-7020, The Environmental Restoration Program, AFI 32-7042, Solid and
        Hazardous Waste Compliance; AFPD 48-1, Aerospace Medicine, and AFPD 32-70,
        Environmental Quality, for guidance on compliance with EPA hazardous materials
        regulations.
2.4. Clean Air Act This act gives the EPA authority over non-NRC regulated radionuclide
emissions from Federal facilities. For applicable regulations, see 40 CFR 61, Subpart I, National
Emission Standards for Radionuclide Emissions From Facilities Licensed by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and Federal Facilities Not Covered by Subpart H. NRC regulates air
emissions from NRC licensed Federal facilities in accordance with 10 CFR 20.1101(d).
Organizations that generate emissions must comply with both NRC and EPA rules. For guidance
on complying with EPA air emission standards, refer to AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality,
and AFI 32-7040, Air Quality Compliance.
2.5. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(CERCLA) Section 103of CERCLA requires notification of the National Response Center
immediately at 1-800-424-8802 in the event a release of greater than the ―reportable quantity‖ of
a hazardous substance is released to the environment. A list of applicable reportable quantities
for radionuclides can be found in 40 CFR 302.4, Appendix B-Radionuclides.
2.6. Emergency Planning and Community-Right-To-Know-Act (EPCRA) EPCRA requires
that whenever a ―reportable quantity‖ of a CERCLA hazardous substance leaves installation
boundaries, the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) and Local Emergency Planning
Commission (LEPC) must be notified immediately (see 40 CFR 355, Emergency Planning and
Notification). Note that EPCRA is not, by its terms, applicable to Federal facilities. The AF
complies with EPCRA on a voluntary basis, as directed by E.O. 13,148 (April 26, 2000).
2.7. Transportation of Hazardous Material Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations
in 49 CFR, Transportation specify requirements for marking, labeling, shipping documents,
containers, and other requirements when shipping or transporting hazardous materials, including
radioactive materials. 49 CFR 172, Hazardous Materials Table, Special Provisions, Hazardous
Materials, Communications, Emergency Response, and Training Requirements, and 49 CFR
173, Shippers – General Requirements for Shipments and Packagings, cover the majority of
requirements related to radioactive material transport.
AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010                                                         29



____________________
1. Note that once RCRA authorized States (i.e. State authorized by EPA to develop and administer
RCRA hazardous waste laws) adopt less stringent Federal RCRA rules that remove radioactive
materials co-mingled with hazardous materials from RCRA regulatory authority, dual regulation of
mixed waste by NRC and EPA authorities will cease and only NRC rules will apply.

   3.3.3. Non-Air Force organizations, except DOE organizations and DOE prime contractors,
   transferring or using radioactive materials on Air Force installations in areas of exclusive
   Federal juridiction must have an NRC or Agreement State license with current NRC Form
   241, NRC Reciprocity Form, authorizing transfer and use on the installation and written
   approval from the Installation Commander's appointed approval authority, normally the
   installation RSO.
   3.3.4. DOE organizations and DOE prime contractors must certify, in writing, that they are
   exempt from NRC licensing requirements.
3.4. Requesting Permits, Amendments, and Other Authorizations for Radioactive Material
Use
   3.4.1. There are two types of Air Force permits: Template and Non-Template.
      3.4.1.1. Template permits are issued for devices or applications that pose relatively little
      radiological risk and employ standardized permit conditions (see A4.3.1 for examples).
      3.4.1.2. Non-Template permits are issued to activities that involve significant amounts of
      sealed or unsealed radioactive materials and pose greater than minimal radiological risk.
      These permits mandate detailed radiation protection programs and terms and conditions
      for use. Examples include nuclear medicine clinics, radioactive waste sites, research
      laboratories or other unique applications where standard permit conditions are not
      appropriate.
   3.4.2. Application for New Permits: Initial applications for both types of permits are
   prepared and submitted in accordance with Attachment 4. EXCEPTION: AFMOA/SGPR
   should be contacted if an immediate mission critical permit or amendment is required, and
   that due to time constraints cannot be handled in accordance with procedures given in
   Attachment 4.
      3.4.2.1. For NRC forms, regulatory guides, and guidance on the administrative aspects of
      permits, contact AFMOA/SGPR, 202-767-4300, https://www.afms.mil/rad_prot/.
      Regulatory guides are also available through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at
      http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/ doc-collections/.
      3.4.2.2. All applications will require the signature of a permittee and the assignment of a
      permit RSO by the permittee. The permittee is generally the Commander, or civilian
      equivalent of the organization responsible for the activity. Refer to Attachment 5 for
      permit RSO requirements.
      3.4.2.3. Activities planning new or unique applications of radioactive materials must
      contact AFMOA/SGPR as early as possible to decide the scope of the permit and the
      need for a site visit by the permit action officer or AFIA/SG.
      3.4.2.4. Plans for new facilities, in which either large quantities of sealed sources (see

License issued by the NRC or Agreement State to a named applicant who has filed an application
authorizing acquisition, ownership, receipt, storage, use, transfer, and disposal of chemical or
physical forms of radioisotopes specified in the license. This license has an expiration date
renewable on application to the issuing authority. The license may be limited in scope
(authorizing only certain specific radioisotopes for limited users) or broad (authorizing the use of
a wide variety of radioisotopes without regard to form, quantity, or use).
Medical Event—any event that meets the criteria of 10 CFR 35.3045(a).
Mishap—For purposes of this instruction, a mishap is defined in AFI 9 1-202. It is an event
involving human acts of omission or commission involving a nuclear reactor, radioisotope power
system, or radioactive material resulting in any of the following:
       1. A loss of control of radioactive material that presents a hazard to life, health, or

RSO should be the most technically qualified person available. The RSO must have the
education, military training, and professional experience needed for the job. Take care when
addressing RSO qualifications and duties to distinguish between installation and permit RSOs.
Individuals appointed as the installation RSO might not always have the specific technical
experience and training needed to qualify as the permit RSO.
Radioactive Item—A single unit or article constructed of or having radioactive materials as a
component part
Radioactive Material—Materials whose nuclei, because of their unstable nature, decay by
emission of ionizing radiation. The radiation emitted may be alpha or beta particles, gamma or
X-rays, or neutrons.
Radioactive Waste—Waste that contains radioactive material. Radioactive waste can be
generally classed in one of four categories:
High Level Radioactive Waste (HLRW)——HLRW is spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power
plants and waste material from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel.
Transuranic Waste—Waste material that contains transuranic elements with half-lives greater
than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100 nanoCuries per gram. A transuranic is an
element with an atomic number greater than 92 (e.g. plutonium, americium, curium).
Low level Radioactive Waste (LLRW)——LLRW is any radioactive waste that is not HLRW,
uranium tailings, or transuranic waste.
Mixed Waste—Waste that contains hazardous waste and source, special nuclear, or byproduct
material subject to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (i.e., material regulated by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission).
Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)—A power system using the thermal energy
produced by the radioactive decay of the unstable nuclei of certain isotopes as its energy source.
Restricted Area—For this instruction, a restricted area is an area having access limited to
protect individuals against undue risks from exposure to radiation and radioactive material.
AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010                                                         59


Restricted area does not include areas used as residential quarters, but separate rooms in a
residential building may be set apart as a restricted area.
SAFE HAVEN—Temporary storage provided Department of Energy classified shipment
transporters at Department of Defense facilities in order to assure safety and security of nuclear
material and/or non-nuclear classified material.
Source Material—Uranium or thorium or any combination thereof in any physical or chemical
form; or ores that have, by weight, one-twentieth of 1 percent (0.05 percent) or more of uranium,
thorium, or any combination thereof. Source material does not include special nuclear material.
Special Nuclear Material—Plutonium, uranium-233, uranium enriched in the isotope 233 or in the
isotope 235; any other material that the NRC determines to be special nuclear material and any
material artificially enriched by the foregoing. Special nuclear material does not include source
material.
Unrestricted Area—For this instruction, an unrestricted area is any area access to which is not
controlled by the permittee. Generally, it is an area that is accessible to a person who is not
trained to work with radioactive materials or accessible to a member of the public.
USAF Radioactive Material Permit— Written authorization from the USAF Radioisotope
Committee for Air Force organizations to receive, possess, use, distribute, store, transport, transfer
and dispose of radioactive materials. Permits parallel NRC licenses in applications and scope. Unlike
the NRC, a single permit may authorize byproduct, source, special nuclear material, Accelerator
Produced Radioactive Material and Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material.
USAF Radioisotope Committee (RIC, Committee)— A committee established in accordance
with requirements of the Air Force Master Materials License to coordinate the administrative and
regulatory aspects of licensing, receiving, possessing, using, distributing, storing, transporting,
transferring and disposing of all radioactive materials in the Air Force, except that material
transferred from the Department of Energy to the Department of Defense in nuclear weapon systems,
certain radioactive parts of weapons systems and nuclear reactor systems, parts and fuel controlled
under Section 91(a) or 91(b) of the AEA. It is composed of stake-holder representatives from Staff
Air Force and Headquarters Air Force.
USAF Radioisotope Committee Secretariat—The office providing day-to-day management of
AF permitting activities under the purview of the Air Force MML. The Secretariat is the
Radiation Protection Division of the Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA/SGPR).
User—For this instruction, a user is (1) An organization authorized by a USAF Radioactive
Material Permit to have and use radioactive materials, or (2) A person specifically named on a
USAF Radioactive Material Permit as authorized to handle or to supervise handling radioactive
materials listed on the permit, or (3) A person named in a permit condition by a radiation safety
committee with local approval authority to handle or supervise the handling of radioactive
materials listed on the permit. Also see Authorized User.
Written Directive—an authorized user’s record written order for the administration of by
product material or radiation from byproduct material to a specific patient or human research
subject, as specified in 10 CFR 35.40. An order must be in writing for a specific patient, dated
and signed by an authorized user before the administration of I-131 greater than 30 microCuries,
any therapeutic dosage of unsealed byproduct material or any therapeutic dose of radiation from
byproduct material.

     https:// kx.afms.mil/rad_prot/ should be consulted for the most current list of template
     permitted items and the standardized "Request for Template Permit Action" form and
     application instructions. Do not alter the form.
     A4.3.3. Applying for or renewing a template permit is accomplished through completion of
     the "Request for Template Permit Action" form. Applications and amendments should be
     forwarded to AFMOA/SGPR at least 30 days prior to the receipt of material or requested
     change, respectively. Once received, a renewed or amended permit will be prepared and
     provided to the permittee. NOTE: For renewals only, if RSO qualifications are already on
     file, they need not be re-sent.
A4.4. Non-Template Permits: Radioactive material uses not identified in A4.3.1 above require
a non-template permit. Common activities and practices performed under a non-template permit
include: nuclear medicine, irradiator operations, and significant remediation activities at sites

                 SUMMARY OF RECORDS RETENTION REQUIREMENTS

A7.1. Refer to the applicable CFR and the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/ for records retention requirements. Use the longer period
of retention if there is a difference between the CFR and RDS. This attachment serves as a
general guideline for regulatory requirements. All records must remain legible throughout the
retention period. Records must include all pertinent information, such as stamps, initials and
signatures (10 CFR 20.2110). Archive all documents with the base safety office/environmental
management office. Coordinate with AFMOA/SGPR on disposition of records requiring
permanent archival storage at permit termination.

                                   INSPECTIONS POLICY

A13.1. Introduction. The inspection program for permitted and generally licensed radioactive
material is under the jurisdiction of the RIC is expressly covered by this instruction. It is an
assigned function of the RICS and must be prioritized to the RICS and sufficiently resourced. It
serves to validate compliance with permit conditions, this instruction and Federal regulations
(e.g. NRC and DoT). Inspections of permits shall be conducted by the AF Inspection Agency,
Medical Operations Directorate (AFIA/SG), the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or
collaboratively. Inspections shall combine a "performance" based evaluation in accordance with
NRC Manual Chapter 2800, Materials Inspection Program, and as necessary, may apply a
"prescriptive" evaluation to ensure the implementing conditions of this AFI are accomplished.
The frequency and duration of the inspection shall be based on the inspection priority assigned
by the RICS, complexity of the permit, overall risks of the permitted activity and opportunity to
witness infrequent or unique procedures. Inspections by either organization shall avoid
interference with the permittee’s operational obligations; however, a permittee shall not delay
inspections based on inconvenience. NOTE: 10 CFR 30.52 states, "Each licensee shall afford to
the NRC at all reasonable times the opportunity to inspect byproduct material and the premises
and facilities wherein byproduct material is used or stored. Each licensee shall make available to
the NRC for inspection, upon reasonable notice, records kept by him." This access shall also be
afforded to AFIA/SG.
A13.2. Inspection Protocol
   A13.2.1. The AFIA/SG inspector shall be in uniform, credentialed with a DOD common
   access card (CAC) and either possess a badge, orders or a list of telephone numbers from
   which the permittee may call for verification. The inspector shall have a clearance verified in
   the Joint Clearance and Access Verification System (JCAVS). The NRC shall have
   identification and, as necessary, be able to demonstrate appropriate clearance. The permittee
   has a right and duty to challenge unknown individuals presenting themselves as inspectors.
   A13.2.2. Inspections are generally conducted unannounced, on-site and in person.
   Occasionally inspections shall be conducted at times outside of normal duty hours,
   particularly when the use or receipt of permitted material is conducted. A valid inspection
   involves AFIA/SG contact with the permittee, Permit Radiation Safety Officer (PRSO) or
   cognizant individual using material covered by the permit.
   A13.2.3. Telephonic inspections may be performed per NRC Priority T criteria. These are
   generally reserved for geographically separated units, permits that are low risk (i.e., 5 -7 year
   inspection frequency) or new permits where permitted materials have not yet been received.
   In those cases, the PRSO may be required to submit by mail, fax or e-mail permit
   documentation that would include: (1) Completed questionnaire, (2) inventory(s), (3) area
   surveys, (4) receipts for transferred RAM, and (5) annual briefing to the Commander. The
   PRSO shall submit to a telephonic inspection by AFIA/SG when requested. As necessary, an
   on-site or telephonic follow-up inspection may be conducted at any time.
   A13.2.4. In some instances, whereby the individuals listed in paragraph A13.2.2. may not be
   available, an attempt shall be made to schedule an inspection. This is generally done to
96                                           AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010


     accommodate permits for which the PRSO works part time (e.g., Air National Guard and AF
     Reserve Command units).
     A13.2.5. A unit that has deployed the PRSO and does not have an alternate at base is still
     subject to inspection by AFIA/SG. Failure to comply with the conditions of the permit, this
     instruction or Federal regulations shall result in a violation, particularly if permitted material
     is not properly controlled. In this instance, AFMOA/SGPR may commence enforcement
     according to Attachment 14.
     A13.2.6. AFIA/SG is not required to pre-inspect any unit prior to an NRC inspection. Units
     are expected to be in compliance at all times. AFIA/SG is not required to inspect any unit
     following a NRC inspection where there are no Severity Level I-III violations. Generally, the
     clock on the next inspection will be restarted and occur at the frequency noted by the permit.
A13.3. Inspections Types
     A13.3.1. New permit. Shall be conducted approximately six months after permitted
     materials are received. Permittees are required to immediately notify AFIA/SG when
     permitted materials have been received.
     A13.3.2. Routine. Shall be conducted at intervals established by the permit or as established
     in NUREG 1556, Volume 20. Inspection frequency may be changed based on permittee
     performance.
     A13.3.3. Follow-up. Shall be conducted when permittees receive NRC Severity Level I-III
     violations. Such may also be requested by the RIC. They will occur within a year following
     closure of corrective actions.
     A13.3.4. Collaborative. AFIA/SG may choose to accompany the NRC during an inspection.
     NRC inspections may occur at any time and are not bound by the intervals established by the
     permit or recentness of the last AFIA/SG inspection. Whereas there are no violations,
     AFIA/SG will re-start the clock for the next inspection. Conversely, the NRC may choose to
     accompany AFIA/SG during an inspection. Typically, the NRC does not issue a report under
     these conditions.
     A13.3.5. Incident. May be conducted based on concern expressed by AFMOA/SGPR, the
     NRC or following a significant event (e.g., personnel health and safety violations, loss of
     control of radioactive material, radiation exposure exceeding regulatory guidelines, natural
     disaster or equipment failures). In these instances, AFIA/SG may conduct an off-cycle visit
     or inspection either unannounced or scheduled. This type of inspection is generally not rated
     but a report may be generated.
     A13.3.6. Consultancy. Upon request of the permittee, AFIA/SG may conduct a scheduled
     visit to identify areas where assistance and improvements can be made. Furthermore,
     AFIA/SG may conduct a scheduled visit to advise the permittee on how to implement new
     AFIs or Federal regulations. Consultancy visits, requested by the permittee, are generally
     funded by the requesting organization. This type of visit shall not be rated but a report should
     be generated.
     A13.3.7. Permit Termination. A termination inspection may be scheduled and conducted
     during or following the termination of a broadscope permit, remediation activity or permitted
     activity involving significant amounts of unsealed radioactive material, to assure the criteria
AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010                                                         97


   of 10 CFR 20, Subpart E are met. This type of inspection shall not be rated but a report may
   be generated.
   A13.3.8. Special Emphasis. As required and prescribed by the RICS, AFIA/SG shall
   provide for inspections of permitted and generally licensed radioactive material to ensure the
   Air Force remains in compliance with NRC regulations.
   A13.3.9. Other. Wherever there is geographic clustering of permits, it may be advantageous
   for AFIA/SG to accelerate the date of the next inspection. This predominantly applies to
   permits with a 5 or 7-year inspection frequency and within one or two years of their next
   inspection. This would serve to align the inspection frequency of similar permits in a
   geographic region to reduce repetitive travel.
A13.4. Severity Levels of Violations
   A13.4.1. AFIA/SG violations have been generally cross-referenced to NRC categories and
   Severity Levels. Since regulatory requirements have varying degrees of safety, safeguards, or
   environmental significance, violations of given requirements have differing levels of
   significance that are represented by the severity levels.
   A13.4.2. Comparisons of severity between disparate activities (e.g., nuclear medicine vs.
   gauges) will not be made. Severity is assigned on a case-by-case basis. Repeat violations,
   willfulness and false representations will influence the severity of a violation.
   A13.4.3. Minor – Below Severity Level IV. May not warrant documentation or enforcement.
   Examples under miscellaneous matters might include:
       1. Lapse in inventory/transfer records without loss of material.
       2. Lapse in PRSO appointment or expired permit without impact on safety.
   A13.4.4. Severity Level IV. Non-compliance with NRC requirements and pose increased
   risk. Examples would be:
       1. Health Physics. Failure to maintain and implement radiation programs to keep radiation
       exposures ALARA.
       2. Miscellaneous. Information that the NRC requires be kept by a permittee and that is
       incomplete or inaccurate and of more than minor significance (e.g., area survey records).
   A13.4.5. Severity Level III. Cause for regulatory concern. Examples would be:
       1. Health Physics. Conduct of licensee activities by a technically unqualified person.
       2. Miscellaneous. Delay in notifying the RIC upon loss of RAM.
   A13.4.6. Severity Level II. Involve actual or high potential consequence on public and
   safety.
       1. Health Physics. A radiation exposure of a declared pregnant worker during the gestational
       period in excess of 1.0 rem TEDE.
       2. Miscellaneous. "Significant information identified by a permittee" and not provided to
       AFIA/ SG or the RIC because of careless disregard on the part of the PRSO.
   A13.4.7. Severity Level I. Involve actual or high potential consequences on public health
   and safety.
98                                         AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010


        1. Health Physics. An annual exposure of a member of the public in excess of 1.0 rem TEDE.
        2. Miscellaneous. Inaccurate or incomplete information provided to AFIA/SG, RIC or the
        NRC in a deliberate nature, under official pretense and knowing such was incomplete.
A13.5. Inspection Violations and Actions
     A13.5.1. Minor. These are not violations per se; however, an inspection report may note
     findings and present recommendations. AFMOA/SGPR may require the permittee to reply to
     such. Implementation of recommendations is up to the permittee; however, disregarding
     them may potentially impact compliance.
     A13.5.2. Severity Level IV. Generally, a permittee shall have 5 duty days from the receipt of
     the report to respond in writing to AFMSA/SG3PB and copy AFIA/SG and their MAJCOM.
     AFMSA/SG3PB reserves the right to accelerate the time of the response. AFIA/SG may
     recommend the RICS close violations in advance of enforcement if corrective actions can be
     demonstrated during the inspection or within 5 duty days thereafter.
     A13.5.3. Severity Level I-III. Generally, a permittee shall respond within 24 hours upon
     verbal notification or report, whichever occurs first, to AFMOA/SGPR. A written copy of the
     response will be provided to AFIA/SG and their MAJCOM in 5 duty days. AFMOA/SGPR
     reserves the right to accelerate the time of the response.
     A13.5.4. Stop Action. During the course of an inspection, AFIA/SG may determine a
     procedure or practice to be imminently dangerous to life and health (IDLH). In those cases,
     the inspector shall require the permittee to temporarily cease operations until corrective
     action is taken. As necessary, AFMOA/SGPR shall be contacted. The inspector shall not ask
     the permittee to perform a task that is hazardous, in contravention to the permit, this
     instruction, Federal regulations or has potential to disrupt operational activities.
     A13.5.5. The AFIA/SG inspector shall offer to conduct an out-brief with the PRSO,
     permittee or cognizant individual(s). In cases where the inspection reveals significant
     findings or potential Severity Level I-III violation(s), an out-brief with the permittee and
     his/her Commander shall be mandatory. Moreover, AFIA/SG will contact AFMOA/SGPR
     prior to the out-brief of these type of findings. Following an inspection, AFIA/SG may call
     the permittee for clarifying information. Unless in conflict with this section, AFIA/SG shall
     generate a final report and assign a rating in 60 duty days. The permittee must initiate
     corrective actions in advance of any report.
     A13.5.6. At a minimum, the final report shall be submitted to the permittee, AFMOA/SGPR,
     NRC Region IV and the permittee’s MAJCOM/SG.
     A13.5.7. On a quarterly basis, AFIA/SG shall provide the RIC a summary according to
     paragraph 1.7.6.
A13.6. Ratings. AFIA/SG will issue either a rating of "Compliant" or "Not Fully Compliant" in
the final report. Inspections that are Not Fully Compliant will report Severity Level I -IV
violations that must be handled according to paragraph A.13.5. Whereas there may be no RAM
or performance objectives to evaluate, a rating will not be issued.
A13.7. Corrective Actions. When a Severity Level I-IV violation is identified, corrective
actions shall commence promptly. The permittee shall decide if the response needs to be
AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010                                                       99


coordinated with higher authorities or copied to their respective MAJCOM functionals. Response
to violations shall contain, at a minimum, the following:
   A13.7.1. Reference to the violation(s).
   A13.7.2. Complete description of how the violations(s) were corrected or a timeline, with
   milestones, for corrective actions, to include:
       1. the root cause for the violation(s) or, if contested, the basis for disputing it,
       2. corrective actions that have been taken and the results achieved,
       3. corrective actions that will be taken to avoid future violations, and
       4. date when full compliance was or will be achieved.
   A13.7.3. Designation of an office for monitoring corrective measures, to include a point of
   contact.
   A13.7.4. Signature of the permittee. "For" signatures shall not be accepted without
   certification the permittee is aware of the corrective actions. A statement to that fact shall be
   placed in the body of the response letter. All letters shall be dated.
   A13.7.5. Corrective actions to separate violations shall not be commingled. Each violation
   shall be addressed separately. However, reference to a specific corrective action from another
   violation can made if such would resolve both violations.
A13.8. Rebuttal. If the permittee believes a violation to be invalid, then a written rebuttal shall
be submitted to AFMOA/SGPR within the time limit in paragraph A13.5 Such shall include
reasons for rebuttal and reference the permit, AF instructions or Federal regulations. An
unsupported opinion or supposition that corrective action is unattainable due to external
constraints may not be acceptable to close the matter.
A13.9. Disposition
   A13.9.1. Closure. Upon receipt of a response to the violation from the permittee,
   AFMOA/SGPR shall consider the merit of the corrective actions and, if satisfied, render a
   closure letter. A closure letter shall be submitted to the permittee and copied, at a minimum,
   to their MAJCOM/SG and AFIA/ SG.
   A13.9.2. Non-Closure. If AFMOA/SGPR determines corrective actions are not acceptable to
   close the violations, enforcement actions may be taken according to Attachment 14.
   Enforcement actions shall be submitted to the permittee and copied, at a minimum, to their
   MAJCOM/SG and AFIA/SG.
100                                       AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010


                                         Attachment 14
                               RIC ENFORCEMENT POLICY

A14.1. Introduction and Basic Enforcement Actions This section describes the enforcement
actions available to the RIC in the administration of the Air Force’s MML, and specifies the
conditions under which each may be used. The basic enforcement actions are Notices of
Violation and Orders of various types. Enforcement action is usually taken whenever a violation
of permit requirements or regulations of more than a minor concern is identified. The nature and
extent of the enforcement action is intended to reflect the seriousness of the violation involved.
For the vast majority of violations, a Notice of Violation (NOV) is the usual action. NOVs are
sent to the permittee, with copies to the AFIA/SG, NRC and MAJCOM Bioenvironmental
Engineer, MAJCOM IG, and MAJCOM functional 2-letter (if outside of MAJCOM/SG). They
specify the nature of the violation(s) (permit condition, permit tie-down, this AFI, or Federal
regulations) and require a response for corrective action by a set date.
A14.2. Escalated Enforcement Actions, RIC and RIC Secretariat Directives Whenever
inspections identify conditions or violations that result in significant regulatory concern,
escalated enforcement action through an issued directive is considered. As authorized by this
instruction and AFPD 40-2, a directive is a mandatory written order to modify, suspend, or to
cease and desist from a given practice or activity; or to take additional action as deemed
appropriate. Directives may be issued in lieu of, or in addition to NOVs, generally for Severity
Level I, II, or III violations or other conditions that cause significant regulatory concern.
Directives are mandatory and made effective immediately. Directives may be executed without
prior notice for consultation with the permittee whenever it is determined that the public health,
interest, or safety requires, or when the order is responding to a violation involving willful
negligence. For other cases, the permittee shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate why
the order should not be issued. Directives may be issued as follows:
   A14.2.1. Permit Modification. Permit Modification Orders are issued by AFMOA/SGPR
   when a change in permittee equipment, procedures, personnel, or management controls is
   necessary.
   A14.2.2. Suspension Orders. Suspension Orders are issued by AFMOA/SGPR and signed by
   AF/ SGOP and may apply to all or part of the permitted activity. Ordinarily, a permitted
   activity is not suspended (nor is a suspension prolonged) for failure to comply with
   requirements where such failure is not of willful intent and adequate corrective action has
   been taken. Suspension Orders may be used to remove a threat to the public health and
   safety, or the environment:
       1. When the permittee has not responded adequately to other enforcement action;
       2. When the permittee interferes with the conduct of an inspection or investigation; or
       3. For any reason not mentioned above for which permit activity suspension is authorized by
       the RIC or AFMOA/SGPR in coordination with AF/SGOP.
   A14.2.3. Revocation/Termination Orders. Revocation/Termination Orders are issued by
   AFMOA/ SGPR or the RIC and signed by AF/SGOP.
       1. When a permittee is unable or unwilling to comply with permit requirements;
       2. When a permittee refuses to correct a violation;
AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010                                                            101


      3. When a permittee does not respond to a Notice of Violation when a response was required
      by AFMOA/SGPR or
      4. For any other reason for which revocation is authorized by the RIC or by AFMOA/SGPR
      in coordination with AF/SGOP (i.e., any condition that would warrant refusal of a permit on
      an original application).
   A14.2.4. Cease and Desist Orders. Cease and Desist Orders are issued by AFMOA/SGPR or
   the RIC and signed by AF/SGOP and may be used to stop an unauthorized activity that
   continues after being notified by AFMOA/SGPR that the activity has been deemed
   unauthorized.
   A14.2.5. Confirmatory Action Letters. Confirmatory Action Letters are issued by
   AFMOA/SGPR confirming a permittee’s agreement to take certain actions to eliminate
   significant concerns about health and safety, safeguards, or the environment.
   A14.2.6. Demands for Information. Demands for Information are mandated requests of
   information from permittees or other persons for the purpose of enabling AFMOA/SGPR to
   determine whether an order or other enforcement action should be issued.
   A14.2.7. Other Orders. In addition to the Orders describe above, Orders may be issued to
   permittees that include but are not limited to:
      1. divert facility financial resources to purchase, replace, or excess and dispose of certain
      equipment;
      2. increase the frequency of facility safety committee meetings;
      3. implement meetings between the facility executive management and the RSO on a
      frequent and routine basis;
      4. perform additional or supplemental training to permittee staff;
      5. increase frequencies of facility internal audits or other internal surveillance; and
      6. appear before the RIC to present corrective actions and associated implementation
      timelines.
A14.3. Factors Impacting Escalated Enforcement Actions
   A14.3.1. Initial Escalated Action: When the RIC or AFMOA/SGPR is made aware of
   conditions or violations where escalated enforcement action may be necessary, deliberations
   are held to determine the severity level of the findings and factors that may affect that level.
   Serious findings will often include deliberations with the NRC. If it is established that an
   unwillful Severity Level III violation or problem has occurred, and the permittee has not had
   any previous escalated actions (regardless of the activity area) during the past 2 years or 2
   inspection cycles, whichever is longer, AFMOA/SGPR will consider whether the permittee’s
   corrective action for the noted violation or problem is reasonably prompt and comprehensive.
   The starting point of this period shall be considered the date when the permittee was put on
   notice to take corrective action.
   A14.3.2. Credit for Actions Related to Identification: If a Severity Level I or II violation or a
   willful Severity Level III violation has occurred, or if, during the past two years or two
   inspection cycles, whichever is longer, and the permittee has been issued at least one other
   escalated action, the escalated enforcement actions shall consider the factor of identification
102                                        AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010


  in addition to corrective action. The decision on identification requires considering all the
  circumstances of identification including:
      1. Whether the problem requiring corrective action was AFIA/SG identified, AFMOA/
      SGPR-identified; permittee-identified, or discovered through an event;
      2. Whether prior opportunities existed to identify the problem requiring corrective action, and
      if so, the age and number of those opportunities;
      3. Whether the problem was discovered as the result of a permittee’s self-monitoring effort,
      such as conducting an audit, a test, a surveillance, a design review, or troubleshooting;
      4. For a problem discovered through an event, the ease of discovery, and the degree of
      permittee initiative in identifying the root cause of the problem and any associated violations;
      5. For AFIA/SG identified issues, whether the permittee would have likely to identified the
      issue in the same time-period if the Agency had not been involved;
      6. For AFIA/SG identified issues, whether the permittee should have identified the issue (and
      taken action) earlier; and
      7. For cases in which AFIA/SG identifies the overall problem requiring corrective action
      (i.e., a programmatic issue), the degree of permittee initiative or lack of initiative in
      identifying the problem or problems requiring corrective action."
  A14.3.3. Prompt and Comprehensive Corrective Action: Comprehensive corrective action is
  required for all MML violations. In most cases, AFMOA/SGPR does not propose escalated
  enforcement actions where the permittee promptly identifies and comprehensively corrects
  violations. However, a Severity Level III violation or higher will almost always result in
  escalated enforcement actions if a permittee does not take prompt and comprehensive
  corrective actions to address the violation. The following factors are considered:
      A14.3.3.1. Timeliness and Extent of Corrective Action.
      1. Consideration will be given to the:
          a. timeliness of the corrective action (including the promptness in developing the
          schedule for long term corrective action),
          b. adequacy of the permittee’s root cause analysis for the violation, and
          c. comprehensive nature of the corrective action (i.e., whether the action is focused
          narrowly to the specific violation or broadly to the general area of concern).

      2. The permittee takes immediate actions necessary, upon discovery of a violation, that will
      restore safety, and return the permit to full compliance; and
      3. Develop and implement the lasting actions that will not only prevent recurrence of the
      violation, but will be comprehensive enough, given the significance and complexity of the
      violation, to prevent occurrence of violations with similar root causes.
      A14.3.3.2. Adequacy of Corrective Actions. AFIA/SG will assist AFMOA/SGPR to
      determine adequacy of correction actions to violations. AFMOA/SGPR shall determine
      the adequacy of corrective actions to violations that are self-identified, result from an
      event, or are MML-identified. The judgment of the adequacy of corrective actions may
      also occur at the time of an enforcement conference (i.e., by outlining substantive
      additional areas where corrective action is needed).
AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010                                                             103


       A14.3.3.3. Corrective Action Process. The following shall be used for developing and
       implementing corrective actions. Corrective action shall be comprehensive enough to not
       only prevent recurrence of the violation at issue, but also to prevent occurrence of similar
       violations. These items should help in focusing broad corrective actions to the general
       area of concern rather than to specific violations. The actions that need to be taken are
       dependent on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The corrective action
       process should involve the following steps:
               1. Conduct a complete and thorough review of the circumstances that led to the
               violation,
               2. Identify the root cause of the violation, and
               3. Take prompt and comprehensive corrective action that will address the immediate
               concerns and prevent recurrence of the violation.
A14.4. Enforcement Conferences
   A14.4.1. When a permittee has been issued a violation and fails to conform to effective
   corrective actions, the RIC or AFMOA/SGPR may decide to initiate an enforcement
   conference with the permittee to define the actions necessary to begin effective corrective
   measures to the violation. AFMOA/ SGPR will issue official correspondence to the permittee
   informing them of the enforcement conference. The enforcement conference can be
   implemented by any necessary means to affect a productive dialogue between the permittee,
   the RIC and AFMOA/SGPR.
   A14.4.2. The purpose of the conference is for the RIC or AFMOA/SGPR to gather the
   necessary facts and information from the permittee in order to make an informed decision
   about the violation. Objectives of the conference will include determining:
       1. the root cause and analysis of the violation(s),
       2. that a permittees response is deemed timely and appropriate, and
       3. that corrective actions to prevent similar recurrence of the violation(s) have been taken.
   A14.4.3. Results of the enforcement conference will be formalized by AFMOA/SGPR with
   correspondence to the permittee describing the actions the permittee must perform to resolve
   the viola-tion(s).
A14.5. Appealing Enforcement Actions The permittee or any other person adversely affected
by a NOV or Order may appeal a NOV or enforcement sanction. The permittee may submit an
appeal via official correspondence to AFMOA/SGPR for the violations and findings. The
permittee must provide ample regulatory justification in the correspondence to warrant an appeal
of the violations. The RIC shall review the appeal by the permittee and decide actions to be taken
based on the merit of the request, corrective actions taken by the permittee, and the severity
levels of the violations. The RIC may at its option, initiate a review of permittee program
operations concerning the enforcement action, grant the appeal to mitigate the severity level of
the violation and/or enforcement actions, or deny the appeal.
A14.6. NRC Related Administrative Actions In addition to the enforcement actions by the
RIC and RIC Secretariat, the NRC also uses administrative actions, such as Notices of Violation,
Notice of Deviation, Notices of Nonconformance, Confirmatory Action Letters, Letters of
Reprimand, and Demands for Information to supplement its enforcement program. The NRC
104                                        AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010


may issue orders and impose civil penalties for violations of NRC regulations and MML license
conditions. Note that any notice of violation involving radiological working conditions, proposed
imposition of civil penalty, or order issued and any response must be posted by the permittee per
10 CFR 19.11(a)(4).
   A14.6.1. Civil Penalty. Only the NRC may impose civil penalties. A civil penalty is a
   monetary penalty that may be imposed by the NRC for violation of certain specified
   licensing provisions of the Atomic Energy Act or supplementary NRC rules or orders, any
   requirement for which a MML permit or NRC license may be revoked, reporting
   requirements under Section 206 of the Energy Reorganization Act, and NRC Regulations and
   MML program conditions. If the application of the normal guidance in this policy does not
   result in an appropriate sanction, as warranted, then the NRC may apply its full enforcement
   authority where the action is warranted. NRC action may include civil penalties, issuing
   appropriate orders, and assessing civil penalties for continuing violations on a per day basis,
   up to the NRC limit per violation.
   A14.6.2. Mitigation of Enforcement Actions. The NRC may exercise discretion and refrain
   from enforcement action, if the outcome of the normal process described in this policy does
   not result in a sanction consistent with an appropriate regulatory message. In addition, even if
   the NRC exercises this discretion, when the permittee failed to make a required report to
   AFIA/SG or AFMOA/SGPR, a separate enforcement action will be issued for the permittee’s
   failure to make a required report.
A14.7. Enforcement Actions Involving Individuals An enforcement action against an
individual will be taken only when the RIC or AFMOA/SGPR is satisfied that the individual
fully understood, or should have understood, his or her responsibility; knew, or should have
known, the required actions; and knowingly, or with careless disregard (i.e., with more than mere
negligence) failed to take required actions which have actual or potential safety significance.
Transgressions of individuals at the level of Severity Level III or IV violations will be handled
by citing the facility permittee with a requirement that specific actions concerning the individual
be taken.
   A14.7.1. Management Failures. Action against an individual will not be taken if it
   demonstrates that the improper action by the individual was caused by management failures.
   The following are examples of situations to illustrate this concept:
       1. Inadvertent individual mistakes resulting from inadequate training or guidance provided by
       the permittee.
       2. Inadvertently missing an insignificant procedural requirement when the action is routine,
       fairly uncomplicated, and there is no unusual circumstance indicating that the procedures
       should be referred to and followed step-by-step.
       3. Compliance with an express direction of management that resulted in a violation unless the
       individual did not express his or her concern or objection to the direction.
       4. Individual error directly resulting from following the technical advice of an expert (e.g.
       consultant or subcontractor) unless the advice was clearly unreasonable and the permitted
       individual should have recognized it as such.
A14.8. Willful Violations and Actions of Individuals If the actions described in these
examples are taken by permittee authorized individuals or otherwise taken deliberately by an
individual working under permitted activities, then enforcement action may consist of requiring
AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010                                                          105


actions be taken directly concerning the individual. Listed below are examples of situations that
could result in enforcement actions against individuals. The situations include, but are not
limited to, violations that involve:
       1. Willfully causing a permittee to be in violation of permit requirements.
       2. Willfully taking action that would have caused a permittee to be in violation of
       requirements but the consequence(s) of the action did not occur because it was detected and
       corrective action was taken.
       3. Recognizing a violation of procedural requirements and willfully not taking corrective
       action.
       4. Willfully defeating alarms and/or interlocks that have safety significance.
       5. Dereliction of duty.
       6. Falsifying records required by MML requirements or by the permittee.
       7. Willfully providing, or causing a permittee to provide, an Inspection Agency inspector
       with inaccurate or incomplete information on a matter material to the radiation protection
       program.
       8. Willfully withholding safety significant information rather than making such information
       known and available to appropriate supervisory or technical personnel in the permittee’s
       organization.
   A14.8.1. Factors in Deciding Enforcement Actions: In its determination of whether to issue
   requirements that actions be taken concerning an individual, the following factors will be
   considered:
       1. The level of the individual within the organization.
       2. The individual’s training and experience as well as knowledge of the potential
       consequences of the misconduct
       3. The safety consequences of the misconduct.
       4. The degree of supervision of the individual, i.e., how closely is the individual monitored or
       audited, and the likelihood of detection.
       5. The employer’s response, e.g. disciplinary action taken.
       6. The attitude of the offender e.g. admission of misconduct, acceptance of responsibility.
       7. The degree of management responsibility or culpability.
       8. Who identified the misconduct.
   A14.8.2. Types of Enforcement Actions: Any proposed enforcement action against
   individuals must be issued by the RIC. The particular sanction to be used should be
   determined on a case-by-case basis. Notices of Violation and Orders are examples of
   enforcement actions that may be appropriate involving individuals. Orders involving
   individuals might include provisions that would:
       1. Prohibit involvement in MML Program permitted activities for a specified period of time
       (normally the period of suspension would not exceed 5 years) or indefinitely, or
       2. Until certain conditions are satisfied, e.g. completing specified training or meeting certain
       qualifications.
       3. Orders to management requiring retraining, additional oversight, or independent
       verification of activities performed by the person, if the person is to be involved in permitted
106                                       AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010


      activities.
   A14.8.3. Disciplinary Enforcement. Adverse personnel actions and other disciplinary actions
   are the responsibility of the organization to which the individual to be disciplined belongs.
   Discretion may be exercised by either escalating or mitigating enforcement action to ensure
   that the proposed enforcement action reflects the Inspection Agency and AFMOA/SGPR’s
   concerns regarding the violation(s) at issue and that it conveys the appropriate message to the
   permittee.
A14.9. Violations of Reporting Requirements or Submitting False Information
   A14.9.1. Reporting: Permittees are expected to provide complete, accurate, and timely
   information and reports when required. A permittee will not usually be cited for a failure to
   report a condition or event unless the permittee was actually aware of the condition or event
   that it failed to report. A permittee will, on the other hand, usually be cited for a failure to
   report a condition or event if the permittee knew of the information to be reported, but did
   not recognize the reporting requirements.
   A14.9.2. Inaccurate and Incomplete Information: A violation of the MML requirements
   involving submittal of incomplete and/or inaccurate information can result in the full range
   of enforcement actions.
      A14.9.2.1. Identification of false information. The labeling of a communication failure
      as a material false statement will be made on a case-by-case basis and will be reserved for
      egregious violations. Violations involving inaccurate or incomplete information or the
      failure to provide significant information identified by a permittee will be categorized
      based on:
      1. the degree of knowledge that the communicator should have had, regarding the matter, in
      view of his or her position, training, and experience;
      2. the opportunity and time available prior to the communication to assure the accuracy or
      completeness of the information;
      3. the degree of intent or negligence, if any, involved;
      4. the formality of the communication;
      5. the importance of the information which was wrong or not provided;
      6. the rationale of the explanation for not providing complete and accurate information;
      7. efforts taken to correct information that is later identified as false or incomplete; and
      8.failures to correct false or incomplete information.

                                 MANAGING ALLEGATIONS

A15.1. Introduction The RIC’s objective is to maintain a safe working environment for
radiation safety personnel and for all staff members at a permittee’s facilities. If an employee is
aware of unsafe conditions or potential regulatory violation(s), then that person is responsible to
report their concerns immediately to their supervisor. The employee can report the unsafe
condition or potential violation allegation directly to AFMOA/SGPR or the NRC (Reference:
Reporting Safety Concerns to the NRC (NUREG/BR-0240, Rev. 3)), but the employee is
strongly encouraged to report the unsafe condition allegation through their chain of command to
allow organizational awareness of the condition and provide corrective actions. All permittee
employees are required to be aware of NRC Form 3, Notice to Employees, that includes posting
the form for all employees to view. Allegations will be investigated and reported in accordance
with NRC Management Directive 8.8, Management of Allegations.
A15.2. Receipt of Allegation
   A15.2.1. Upon initial receipt of contact from an individual making allegations, the
   AFMOA/SGPR member should determine initial background information from that
   individual before proceeding with the potential allegation. Initial information should consist
   of:
       1. name of the person,
       2.contact information of the person,
       3. job position of person,
       4. place and date of allegation,
       5. description of allegation,
       6. other individuals affected by allegation,
       7. command awareness of allegation, and
       8. any health or safety related issue
   A15.2.2. Once the initial contact has been made with the person making the allegation, the
   AFMOA/ SGPR member shall provide the information below to the alleger before
   proceeding with investigating the allegation:
       1. Section 211(a) of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 as amended by the Energy Policy
       Act of 1992 prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee for contacting
       the NRC.
       2. Any civilian can file a complaint with the Department of Labor (DOL) if that person
       believes a MML permittee has acted against that person in violation of the prohibition. The
       Energy Reorganization Act gives jurisdiction to DOL for conducting a hearing on the issue
       and for determining whether the law was violated. If the DOL requires any corrective actions
       in its decision, further corrective action may be required by the NRC, the RIC and/or
       AFMOA/ SGPR. If the allegation involves a health or safety violation, then the NRC and/or
       RIC through AFMOA/SGPR will determine corrective action(s) prior to the final decision by
       the DOL.
       3. Information provided under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) will, to the extent
       consistent with that act, be purged of names and other potential identifiers of individuals
108                                         AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010


       making the allegation, but disclosures may be necessary under this Act.
       4. No reference to follow-up of an allegation or employee concern will be entered on the
       inspection forms, inspection reports, or other documents that will be filed in the permitting
       file for the permittee.
       5. AFMOA/SGPR will protect the identity of the individual making the allegation, and any
       identifying information of that individual will not be used in discussions of allegations,
       internal AFMOA/SGPR documents, or documents released to the permittee or the members
       of the general public.
       6. The RIC through AFMOA/SGPR is responsible for resolving each allegation it has
       received and notifying the alleger of the results of the investigation.
   A15.2.3. After initial receipt of an allegation, a brief written report should be forwarded to
   AFMOA/ SGPR for review and determination of the main merits of investigating the
   allegation. The allegation will then be presented to the RIC. This case will be referred to
   AFIA/SG and a second independent consultant to begin the investigation, as determined by
   the RIC. The AFMOA/SGPR representative investigating the allegation will provide a final
   report of the investigation to the RIC for its review. An allegation involving a health or safety
   issue will have a higher priority for review and plan of action.
A15.3. Protecting the Identity of Individuals making Allegations The name of the
individual(s) making the allegation(s) and other identifying information which could potentially
identify the individual(s) will not be used in discussions of allegations or documents released to
the permittee or members of the public related to the allegation. The identity of the individual(s)
will be protected, and the Inspection Agency will not advise a permittee that an inspection is
based on an allegation. Exceptions to this policy include:
       1. the circumstance where the individual has no objection to the release of his/her identity
       and is documented in the allegation file,
       2. communications within and between the RIC, RIC Secretariat, the NRC, the AF Inspection
       Agency, and other parties that require knowledge of this identity to properly manage the
       allegation, or
       3. the circumstance where such protection would impact worker health and safety.
A15.4. Maintenance of Allegation Files AFMOA/SGPR maintains the official file of all
information pertaining to each allegation. It is important that AFMOA/SGPR and RIC members
assure there is no unauthorized reproduction of information related to an allegation. Copies of
allegation files may be made following approval by the AFMOA/SGPR case representative. All
copies made of an allegation file must be returned to the file or destroyed. These files must be
maintained in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Act.
A15.5. Allegation Information in Inspection Reports The investigation into the allegation
should be documented in an inspection report. It is important that the inspection reports protects
the identity of the individual(s) making the allegation(s) and not provide any information in the
report that may reveal his/her identity. The inspection report should not contain any detailed
information of the inspection that would correlate the inspection to an allegation. The inspection
report findings should be included in the allegation file for the respective allegation case for final
resolution by the RIC.
AFI40-201_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 22 February 2010                                                      109


A15.6. Resolution of Allegations The RIC will review all allegations received. Once all of the
necessary information related to the allegation has been collected, the RIC will review the
allegation file to determine if any further actions are required before a final decision is made. If
any findings of an allegation investigation are in violation of the regulations, then the severity
level of the violation will determine the response by the RIC to the command as described in the
Enforcement Policy, Attachment 14.
A15.7. Allegation Close-Out Report Once the final disposition of an allegation is approved by
the RIC, a formal response and close-out report of the RIC findings will be forwarded to the
individual(s) who made the allegation by AFMOA/SGPR. If the individual(s) does/do not agree
with the findings of the RIC, then the individual(s) may appeal the findings of the RIC with any
additional information necessary to support the appeal of the final allegation findings.
