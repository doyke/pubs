SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This AFPD contains numerous changes including the addition of the Air Force policy to
establish a global Personnel Recovery (PR) Program previously listed under the responsibilities
section of this AFPD. The program will aid in preventing isolation and capture of personnel as
directed by NSPD-12. Further, it will prepare the force to survive, evade, resist and escape and
train Rescue Forces to execute the five PR tasks outlined in this document. Specific
responsibilities are outlined for the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Public Affairs
(SAF/PA), the Air Force Surgeon General (AF/SG), and Headquarters Air Education and
Training Command (HQ AETC).
1. Policy. Preserving the lives and well-being of Air Force military, civilian and DoD
contractor personnel placed in danger of being isolated, detained, captured or having to evade
while participating in a U.S. sponsored activity or mission is one of the highest priorities of the
Air Force. The Department of the Air Force has primary responsibility for recovering Air Force
personnel who become isolated in an uncertain or hostile environment. All Airmen (Air Force
military and civilian employees) and DoD Contractors deploying in support of Overseas
Contingency Operations must comprehend the Code of Conduct, and commanders and staffs
must ensure their personnel are prepared to respond to an isolating event, either as an isolated
person or as a member of a unit with a member that becomes isolated.
     1.1. The Air Force will establish and implement a global Personnel Recovery (PR) program.
     The PR mission area will aid in preventing isolation and capture, preparing the force to
     survive, evade, resist and escape, as well as train rescue forces to execute the five PR tasks
     (report, locate, support, recover and reintegrate), while continuing to adapt PR for continuous
     improvement.
        1.1.1. Prevention: The Air Force will fulfill prevention requirements as directed by
        NSPD-12, Annex 1.
        1.1.2. Preparation: All military Airmen personnel, as well as select DoD civilians and
        contractors, fulfill an expeditionary role within the Air Force. The threats faced by
        Airmen on today’s asymmetric battlefield create an environment where the enemy can
        strike at any time or place and requires all Airmen (Air Force military and civilian
        employees) and DoD Contractors deploying in support of Overseas Contingency
        Operations receive the requisite training in the event of isolation or capture.
            1.1.2.1. All deploying personnel must be trained, prepared, and equipped to
            successfully survive, evade, resist, or escape from potential isolating events or
            situations. As such, all deploying Airmen and contractors will receive, at a minimum,
            initial and recurring Level A Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE)
            Training. Additionally, all Airmen (Air Force military and civilian employees) and
            DoD Contractors deploying in support of Overseas Contingency Operations will
            prepare an Isolated Personnel Report in Personnel Recovery Mission Software
            (PRMS).
            1.1.2.2. The asymmetric nature of the modern battlefield also requires that our
            warfighters and other personnel who are at greater risk of isolation or capture receive
            additional training tailored to the nature of their operational role and the estimated
            risk they may encounter.
AFPD10-30 9 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                      3


          1.1.2.3. Commanders and staffs must be educated and trained to plan and implement
          the PR mission area. Seamless execution of rescue missions necessitates peacetime
          integration of Air Operations Center and Joint Operations Center command and
          control functions in concert with Rescue forces.
       1.1.3. Plan: A focused PR effort requires the Air Force to plan operations with Joint,
       Interagency and Multinational partners. Global and full spectrum rescue operations
       should be preceded by Airmen working with host and partner Nations to build
       partnership capacity. This enables the Air Force PR mission area to leverage partners
       during military, civil and diplomatic PR engagements, and facilitates planning and
       execution of rescue operations.
       1.1.4. Execution: The Air Force PR architecture must be effective in reporting incidents,
       locating, supporting, recovering, and reintegrating isolated personnel (IP).
          1.1.4.1. Report: Unit, Command Post, and Personnel Recovery Coordination Cell
          (PRCC) reporting procedures for overdue, missing, or isolated aircraft and personnel
          must be developed to cover the range of military operations.
          1.1.4.2. Locate: The PR mission focus requires actionable intelligence to locate IPs,
          and a family of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, and
          Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems to report IP location to airborne and ground
          recovery forces.
          1.1.4.3. Support: The support effort ensures the physical and psychological
          sustainment of IP. This includes establishing two-way communications, aerial
          resupply, and prepositioning of caches.
          1.1.4.4. Recovery: The Air Force will maintain properly equipped, sufficiently
          manned, and dedicated Rescue forces. This includes dedicated weapon systems
          procured, sustained, and managed specifically for the Rescue mission.
          1.1.4.5. Reintegration: The Air Force has a moral obligation to reintegrate its IPs and
          assist other services as required. When such individuals are returned to United
          States’ control, the Air Force will provide the appropriate and necessary measures to
          accomplish a successful reintegration that effectively reintroduces the isolated
          personnel back into society and ultimately returns the member back to service.
       1.1.5. Adaptation: The PR mission area requires all personnel with PR equities to study
       lessons learned and adapt operations and tactics, techniques and procedures to better
       prepare rescue forces and to mitigate risk to recovery operations.
