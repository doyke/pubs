     country-to-country agreements. A higher drinking age requirement may also be imposed
     based on the local situation as determined by the installation commander or the senior on-site
     unit commander when there is no installation commander. Coordination with any host nation
     commander is required.
     1.3.6. As states enact new drinking-age laws, installation commanders must make
     corresponding changes in base drinking-age guidance.
     1.3.7. The Air Force, consistent with mission needs, will cooperate with federal, state, and

     guidance:
        1.4.1.1. At Air Force installations located within approximately 50 miles from a
        neighboring state that has a lower drinking age, the minimum base drinking age may be
        lowered to match that of the neighboring state to reduce the likelihood that members will
        drive while intoxicated.
        1.4.1.2. When an entire unit marks a unique or non-routine military occasion on a
        military installation, the minimum drinking age for attendees at a particular unit gathering
        may be lowered.
        1.4.1.3. MAJCOM Directors of Services may not delegate the approval authority for
        exceptions to the minimum drinking age.
     1.4.2. MAJCOM Directors of Services may approve exceptions for any combination of
     beverages, including the following common groupings (each approval document must
     specifically state the alcoholic beverages that the exception covers):
        1.4.2.1. Beer only.
        1.4.2.2. .Wine coolers and other low-alcoholic beverages with less than seven percent
        alcoholic content by volume.

     above criteria.
1.5. Dram Shop Liability. The "Dram Shop" theory is a legal theory of liability, created either
by statute or court decision, which imposes upon the owner, operator, and (or) employees of any
establishment serving alcoholic beverages the duty to refuse to serve additional alcoholic
beverages to a customer who reaches or appears to be reaching the point of intoxication. When
an establishment continues to sell alcoholic beverages to such a customer and the customer
subsequently departs and causes harm to himself or herself , or to others, the owner, operator,
and (or) employees of the establishment can be held liable for damages. To protect the assets and
AFI34-219_DOVERAFBSUP_I 25 OCTOBER 2013                                                       5

       responsibility under the dram shop theory of liability not to sell or serve alcoholic
       beverages to persons who appear to be nearing intoxication and not in complete control
       of their faculties." The statement is placed in the comments section of the employee’s
       work folder by the server’s supervisor.

      SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES FOR OFF-PREMISE CONSUMPTION

3.1. AAFES. AAFES is designated as the single manager of packaged alcoholic beverage

beverage policy appears in AFJI 34-210, Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES)
Operating Policies.
3.2. Base Services Activities. Services and other Air Force activities may not compete with
AAFES to sell packaged alcoholic beverages. When approved by the installation commander,
Services activities may sell beer, wine coolers, and other commercially packaged alcoholic
beverages with less than seven percent alcoholic content by volume for off-premises
consumption, but must restrict these sales to time periods when AAFES-operated retail outlets on
the installation are closed. Services may not offer package alcohol for a lower price than AAFES
charges for the same item.
3.2. (DOVERAFB) Except as listed in paragraph 3.2.1, Force Support Squadron Activities will
not sell packaged alcoholic beverages for consumption off-premises.
   3.2.1. Packaged beer or wine sales that Services offers as part of a party contract or takeout
   food and beverage operation are exempt from this restriction. Takeout operations normally
   may only sell 6-pack containers and similarly packaged products to include keg beer.
   3.2.2. Clubs may sell bottled wines and champagnes listed on the dining room wine list for
   off-premise consumption under these conditions:
       3.2.2.1. Clubs may not set up rooms separate from the dining room to display or sell for
       off-premise consumption.
       3.2.2.2. Clubs ensure that dining room list prices comply with the pricing policy
       specified in paragraph 3.6
   3.2.3. Club and Class Six outlet managers must ensure that package alcohol sales are made
   only to patrons authorized to use the Class Six store. (Refer to paragraph 3.4 for specific
   instructions on authorized patronage and the attachment for the definition of Class Six.)
   Managers must inform patrons of the maximum quantities that an individual may legally
   transport into or through the state, district, territory, or country where the installation-of-
   purchase is located.
3.3. Establishing Class Six Outlets.
   3.3.1. In the United States, installations may operate Class Six outlets when approved by the
   Secretary of the Air Force. AFJI 34-210 contains procedures for establishing a Class Six
   store.

   contradictory status-of-forces or other country-to-country or local governmental agreement.
       3.3.2.1. MAJCOMs or Field Operating Agencies (FOA) may approve such operations if
       requested by AAFES. MAJCOMs and FOAs must send an information copy of each
       approval to HQ AFSVA/SVPB at least 30 days prior to approving a new Class Six store.

packaged alcoholic beverages to unauthorized personnel or for purposes that violate Federal,
state, or local laws, or status-of-forces or other country-to-country agreements.
3.6. Pricing. Services activity managers must ensure their prices for packaged alcoholic
beverages containing less than seven percent alcohol by volume are no lower than those charged
by AAFES and substantially uniform with other military service outlets in the same geographic
area.
3.7. Wholesale Sales. AAFES is the prime wholesaler of alcoholic beverages on Air Force
installations.
   3.7.1. AAFES provides all requested alcoholic beverage products to authorized Services and
   NAF-supported base activities.
   3.7.2. If AAFES has stock shortages, activities selling alcoholic beverages by the drink have
   first priority.
   3.7.3. AAFES sets wholesale prices based on the "landed cost". A Class Six store pays for
   alcohol purchases (the purchase order price that the store pays, adjusted for vendor and
   invoice discounts, plus costs incurred to bring goods to the point of sale). AAFES assesses no
   additional transportation, warehousing distribution, or handling charges.
       3.7.3.1. AAFES notifies HQ AFSVA/SVP if exceptional conditions (national disasters,
       transportation strikes, etc.) arise that affect wholesale prices.
   3.7.4. Sale of Class Six merchandise to any non-MWR/NAF organizations or activities will
   be authorized IAW Army Regulation (AR) 215-1/AFR 215-7. Sale price will be at no less
   than full retail price or as determined by Commander, AAFES.
   3.7.5. Services and other NAF-supported activities may purchase alcoholic beverages from
   sources other than AAFES. Compliance with paragraph 1.6 is mandatory.
3.8. Labeling Packaged Alcoholic Beverages.
   3.8.1. Public Law 100-690, Title VIII, Alcoholic Beverages Labeling Act of 1988, 18
   November 1988, requires that all packaged containers of alcoholic beverages for resale on
   military installations bear this statement: “GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) According to
   the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because
   of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to
   drive a car or operate machinery and may cause health problems.”
   3.8.2. This requirement also applies to foreign packaged beverages that Services activities
   serve or sell overseas.
   3.8.3. The selling activity's manager must label all beverages that the producer doesn't label.
   Follow these labeling requirements:
