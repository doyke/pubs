This manual provides supplemental Air Force guidance to DoD 5210.42-R, Nuclear Weapons
Personnel Reliability Program (PRP), June 30, 2006, and is effective immediately. Original
DoD text appears in regular font and added Air Force text appears in bold. It implements Air
Force Policy Directive 10-39, Safeguarding Biological Select Agents and Toxins, for PRP form
usage.

It establishes Air Force requirements and policy for the implementation of the PRP to select
and maintain reliable individuals to perform duties associated with nuclear weapons. The PRP
applies to active duty, Reserve, and National Guard units possessing nuclear weapons or
Nuclear Command and Control systems and equipment, and any activity certified by a Service
inspection activity as “nuclear capable.”
                        DoD 5210.42-R_AFMAN 10-3902_AFGSCSUP_I 13 November 2006

The PRP is not intended to act as a quality control tool to decertify/disqualify individuals solely
for assignment purposes or risk avoidance. The denial or eligibility or the revocation of
certification for assignment to PRP positions is neither a punitive measure nor the basis for
disciplinary action (Reference [h]). The failure of an individual to be certified for assignment
to PRP duties does not necessarily reflect unfavorably on the individual’s suitability for
assignment to other duties (Reference [h]).

This Supplement requires the collection of information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974
and Health Information and Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA). Your authority
to collect this information is in Title 10, United States Code, Section 8013. System of
Records Notice F036 AF PC Q, Personnel Data System (PDS), also applies. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, the Privacy Act of 1974,
HIPAA, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil.

(AFGSC) DoD5210.42R_AFMAN10-3902, NUCLEAR WEAPONS PERSONNEL
RELIABILITY PROGRAM (PRP), 13 November 2006 is supplemented as follows: This
publication implements major command policy by supplementing specific processes and
procedures that are unique to Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). It applies to
all active duty AFGSC PRP members, members of the Air Force Reserve and members of
the Air National Guard who are assigned to or are performing PRP duties with AFGSC
units.

(AFGSC) This Supplement establishes AFGSC requirements and guidance associated with
the selection, maintenance, removal actions and formal actions of PRP. It will be used in
conjunction with the current DoD regulation and AFMAN directing PRP and will be
applied to all Active Duty (AD), Reserve components, National Guard, civilian personnel
and contract employees assigned to PRP positions at AFGSC bases.
SUMMARY OF CHANGES

An (*) identifies a change from previous edition.
This Manual will be reviewed in its entirety. It incorporates the guidance from the AF
Guidance Memorandum issued to this publication, dated 16 July 2010. In addition, it
provides clarification and guidance for several definitions, key terms, abbreviations/
acronyms, concepts, practices, procedures and forms disposition (AF Form 286/286A) for
the Air Force Personnel Reliability Program. The more significant changes include: a
provision allowing MAJCOMs to supplement with procedural guidance, limits delegation
of Commanders/Directors, addresses questionable medical PDI discovered during
inspections, directs the use of PRP Questionnaire and inspection Checklists, restates the
limited access of medical records review of CO/RO, provisions for Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training, changes to Administrative
Qualification including the establishment of Continuous Monitoring and more clearly
defined roles and responsibilities for non-PRP Commanders and administratively qualified
individuals. Furthermore, new procedures for Air Force Reserve and National Guard
personnel performing PRP duties, a more clearly defined role for the Air Force Personnel
Center, and disposition guidance for Potentially Disqualifying Information not previously
adjudicated were addressed. This change expands on PRP to PRP transfer, lists
designators for PRP coded manpower billets, and adds Note (12) to the PRP Status Code
Table. In addition, the Air Force PRP Compliance Checklist was deleted from this
regulation and it is located on the Air Force PRP Portal. Finally, many of AFMAN Change
1 inputs were revised to appear at the end of each paragraph not within the paragraph per
DOD publication requirements.

    This Regulation is issued under the authority of DoD Directive 5210.42, “Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability
    Program (PRP),” January 8, 2001. It reissues DoD 5210.42-R, “Department Of Defense Nuclear Weapon Personnel
    Reliability Program (PRP) Regulation,” January 8, 2001 (hereby canceled) and establishes requirements and
    procedures for the implementation of the PRP to select and maintain only the most reliable people to perform duties
    associated with nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons require special consideration because of their policy implications
    and military importance, their destructive power, and the political consequences of an accident, loss of a weapon, or an
    unauthorized act. The safety, security, control, and effectiveness of nuclear weapons are of paramount importance to
    the security of the United States.

    This Regulation applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, the Chairman of the Joint
    Chiefs of Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, the
    Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities, and all other organizational entities within the Department of Defense
    (hereafter referred to collectively as the “DoD Components”). It also applies to DoD military and civilian personnel and
    contractor employees assigned to PRP positions or in training for assignment to PRP positions.

    This Regulation is effective immediately. Because of substantive changes, this Regulation must be reviewed in its
    entirety. Heads of DoD Components may elect to issue supplementary instructions deemed essential to the
    accommodation of requirements peculiar to their operations. Any such instruction may not conflict with the provisions
    of this Regulation. Any additional guidance issued by the DoD Components shall be forwarded to the address below
    within 30 days after publication and after each subsequent change for review.

    Send recommended changes to this Regulation to:

                                     GENERAL PROVISIONS

C1.1. PURPOSE

The purpose of the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) is to ensure that each person who
performs duties involving nuclear weapons meets the reliability standards of the PRP selected and
retained for performing duties associated with nuclear weapons or nuclear command and control
systems and equipment is emotionally stable and physically capable, and has demonstrated
reliability and professional competence. This shall be accomplished through the initial and
continual evaluation of individuals assigned to PRP duties. The management of the PRP is a
function of command. However, each person assigned to PRP duties is responsible for their
reliability and has an obligation to report to the certifying official any behavior or circumstance
about themselves or others in the PRP that may be expected to result in degradation in job
performance or personal reliability or an unsafe or insecure condition involving nuclear weapons
and/or Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) material. The PRP supporting agencies and
supervisors of individuals performing PRP duties shall assist the reviewing and certifying officials
in their initial and continuing evaluation duties by ensuring that all PDI is made available for their
consideration. This Regulation provides procedures for the implementation of Reference (f) and
DoD Directive Instruction 5210.42 (Reference (gh)).

   *C1.1.1. (Added)(AF) The enduring critical purpose of the PRP remains to ensure only
those who meet stringent reliability standards perform duties associated with nuclear
weapons - conversely the PRP will ensure those who do not meet these standards are kept
from performing nuclear weapons-related duties.

       C1.1.1.1. (Added)(AFGSC) The purpose of this AFGSC supplement is to establish
standard procedures in the implementation of the Personnel Reliability Program at all
AFGSC bases and units (as applicable). It will assist in selecting and maintaining only the
most reliable people to perform duties associated with the nuclear enterprise.

       C1.1.1.2. (Added)(AFGSC) Changes or Clarifications. HQ AFGSC/A3 has overall
responsibility for administration of thisAFGSC supplement. All inputs to MAJCOM from
base level will be routed from the installation PRP office. Suggestions for improving this
instruction or requests for clarification are encouraged.

           C1.1.1.2.1. (Added)(AFGSC) Refer recommended changes and questions about

C1.2. PRP ADMINISTRATORS

    C1.2.1. Designation of Reviewing and Certifying Officials. The Heads of the DoD
Components shall establish procedures for formally designating the reviewing officials and
certifying officials. The certifying officials shall be designated as critical or controlled PRP
positions commensurate with the highest category of any nuclear duty position in the unit or
activity concerned.

       C1.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) Reviewing Official (RO).The wing commander/director,
including a commander/director of a non-nuclear installation, will hold this position and will
be PRP certified if performing PRP duties per AP1.T1.

         *C1.2.1.2. (Added)(AF) Certifying Official (CO). Commanders/Directors at wing-
level and below, who serve in a PRP position in order to perform PRP duties will be PRP
certified. Commanders/Directors above wing-level may perform the duties of a certifying
official and do not require PRP certification, unless they serve in a PRP position. If a CO is
the wing commander/director equivalent, the next level of command in the PRP operational
chain will assume RO responsibilities.

        *C1.2.1.3. (Added)(AF) Limited Delegation. Commanders/Directors may delegate
RO, CO and administrative qualification authority in writing to their vice/deputy (or
equivalent) in their PRP operational chain-of-command. Delegation of duties should be
limited and not used on a routine basis. The at or below-wing-level delegated CO must be
in a PRP position and certified (critical or controlled) equal to, or higher than the
personnel they are certifying. If the organization does not have a vice/deputy (or
equivalent) in their operational chain of command then the individual designated by G-
series orders may take on the CO duties. If no G-series orders are issued, then the next
level up in the operational chain of command will assume CO duties. If the CO is
decertified or otherwise removed from duties, the RO will determine appointment of CO
duties, as appropriate.

       *C1.2.1.4. (Added)(AF) Commanders/Directors at Non-PRP Installations.

Change 1, 11/10/2009                              22                                     CHAPTER 1
Commanders/Directors who only perform administrative qualification are not COs and are
not required to be PRP certified. Commanders/Directors may delegate administrative
qualification authority in writing to their vice/deputy (or equivalent) in their chain of
command. Delegation of duties should be limited and not used on a routine basis.

           *C1.2.1.4.1. (Added)(AF) If the organization does not have a vice/deputy (or
equivalent) in their chain of command then the individual designated by G-series orders
may take on the administrative qualification duties. If no G-series orders are issued, then
the next level up in the chain of command will assume administrative qualification duties.

    C1.2.2. Designation of Competent Medical Authority (CMA). The Heads of the DoD
Components shall establish procedures to appoint an agency or installation CMA to act as a PRP
medical consultant to provide recommendations to the reviewing and certifying officials on
individuals’ suitability to perform PRP duties.

       C1.2.2.1. (Added)(AF) MTF CMA. The MTF commander (MTF/CC) will appoint a
MTF PRP consultant qualified to serve as a Lead CMA and acts as the MTF liaison to the
CO for all health related PRP recommendations. The MTF/CC may also appoint additional
providers qualified to serve as CMAs for functional area responsibilities.

    C1.2.3. Agency and Installation PRP Monitor. DoD agencies, installations, and subordinate
units with large PRP populations shall consider appointing a PRP monitor(s) as appropriate, to
administer the day-to-day functions of the PRP. The agency or installation PRP monitor coordinates
and disseminates PRP information to the reviewing and certifying officials, unit commanders, PRP
monitors, and supporting staff agencies; indoctrinates and trains unit PRP
personnel and administrators on program objectives and procedures; maintains the installation
PRP roster; and conducts staff assistance visits to all subordinate units with a PRP.

       C1.2.3.1. (Added)(AF) MAJCOM Monitor (includes SGP/SGO). The MAJCOM
directorates will appoint individuals as the command focal points for all applicable PRP
functional areas.

       C1.2.3.2. (Added) (AF) Installation Monitor. The installation commander/director
will appoint an installation PRP monitor to administer the day-to-day administrative
functions of PRP, or can delegate the appointment authority to the FSS/CC.

           C1.2.3.2.1. (Added)(AFGSC) The installation commander/director will not
delegate the appointment of installation PRP monitor to the FSS/CC. Installation PRP
monitors will be assigned directly under the wing command staff.

      C1.2.3.3. (Added) (AF) MTF Monitor. The MTF/CC will appoint a MTF PRP
monitor to provide administrative support.

      C1.2.3.4. (Added)(AF) Unit Monitor. The unit CO/CC/CL will appoint a unit PRP
monitor as the focal point for the day-to-day administrative functions of PRP. The lead

C2.8. CONTRACTOR PROCEDURES

Certifying officials for contractors whose duties are subject to the PRP shall ensure that contracts
require that the contractor employees performing duties in PRP positions under this Regulation
shall meet the reliability standards of the PRP. Specifically, the contractor shall:

   C2.8.1. Instruct managerial, supervisory personnel, medical personnel, and other support
agencies and offices on the purpose, standards, and procedures of the PRP.

    C2.8.2. Inform and instruct each employee of the significance of the assignment, PRP standards,
the need for reliable performance, and the individual’s responsibility for self-reporting and peer
review of factors and situations that could adversely affect job performance or reliability.

   C2.8.3. Ensure the individual presents a positive attitude toward the PRP and performing
nuclear weapon duties and understands that maintaining PRP standards is a condition of continued
employment in a PRP position.

    *C2.8.4. Ensure that employees to be assigned to a PRP position are subjected to a PSI,
medical record evaluation, substance abuse testing, personal interview, proficiency certification,
and continuing evaluation according to the certifying official, under the reliability standards of
the PRP. Contractor personnel assigned to designated NC2 PRP positions shall be subject to
random CSP testing. (Added)(AF) Contractor personnel shall ensure all dental/medical and
pharmacy insurance information is made available to the CMA.

    C2.8.5. Provide the certifying official with results of a PSI, CSP (if required), medical record
evaluation, and substance abuse testing of any contractor employee assigned, or proposed to be
assigned, to a PRP position. Immediately report any other information about an employee not
maintaining the reliability standards of the PRP.

    C2.8.6. Provide for the continuing evaluation of employees assigned to PRP positions by
contractor supervisory personnel, except when such employees are assigned to a DoD
Component under the direct oversight of DoD personnel where the certifying official shall be

temporary decertification from PRP duties requires that the employee be:

       C2.8.7.1. Instructed to cease performance of PRP duties. Removal from PRP duties does
not constitute a determination that the employee lacks necessary emotional or mental stability or
physical capability to perform duties properly. It does indicate that there is a question about the
employee’s suitability that warrants restriction from PRP duties until the question is resolved.

                                          CERTIFICATION

C3.1. GENERAL

   C3.1.1. The certifying official shall confirm an individual’s eligibility before that individual
begins performing PRP duties. Certification and the individual’s acknowledgment of
understanding of his/her responsibilities while PRP certified shall be formally documented and
maintained while the individual is performing PRP duties.

       *C3.1.1.2. (Added)(AF) Document the certification using the AF Form 286. Follow
the form disposition instructions according to reference [ff] PSD Guide - PRP. Update the
applicable PRP status code (Table 2).

    C3.1.2. The certifying official shall make a judgment on the reliability of each individual
identified for PRP duties. This will be based on the appropriate personnel security investigation,
physical and mental capability, review of personnel and medical records, position qualification
requirements, and a personal interview.

    C3.1.3. The certifying official shall consider all relevant facts applicable to the individual’s
performance record, the results of the PSIs and medical evaluations, and the opinions of other
agencies and personnel, as appropriate, to make the final judgment about an individual’s reliability
and whether he or she can be depended on to respond in a stable manner when performing PRP
duties. The qualifying criteria and processes described in this chapter shall be used by the
certifying official in making that judgment.

C3.2. QUALIFYING CRITERIA

  C3.2.1. Standards. The following represent the reliability standards expected of all PRP
members:

       C3.2.1.1. Physical competence, mental alertness, and technical proficiency commensurate
with duty requirements.

         C3.2.1.2. Dependability in accepting responsibilities and effectively performing in an
approved manner; flexibility in adjusting to changes in the working environment, including
ability to work in adverse or emergency situations.

        C3.2.1.3. Good social adjustment, emotional stability, personal integrity, sound judgment,
and allegiance to the United States.

       C3.2.1.4. Positive attitude toward nuclear weapons duty, to include the purpose of the
PRP.

    C3.2.2. Personnel Security Investigation (PSI). An investigation required for determining the
eligibility of DoD military and civilian personnel, contractor employees, consultants, and other

Change 1, 11/10/2009                             40                                     CHAPTER 3
persons affiliated with the Department of Defense, for access to classified information,
acceptance or retention in the Armed Forces, assignment or retention in sensitive duties, or other
designated duties requiring such investigation. PSIs include investigations of affiliations with
subversive organizations, suitability information, or hostage foreign preference and/or influence
situations conducted to make personnel security determinations. They also include
investigations of allegations that arise subsequent to adjudicative action and require resolution to
determine an individual's current eligibility for access to classified information or assignment or
retention in a sensitive position (see Reference (ef)). (Added)(AF) Individuals certified for
PRP who have an established date of separation or retirement date within 1 year of an
investigation that is out-of scope in accordance with AFI 31-501 (Reference [z]) will be
allowed to remain certified until the discharge date with no PR requested. However,
should the individual decide not to separate or retire, a PR must be immediately requested.
Use the JPAS according to reference [f], adjudication guidelines, to determine current
status of clearance eligibility. Use CASPR to prioritize adjudication of completed PSI for
PRP.

    C3.2.3. Medical Evaluation. The DoD Components shall specify procedures for individual
health record information review. For the purposes of PRP, Reference (l) authorizes disclosure
of protected health information of military personnel without authorization and of civilians and
contractor employees pursuant to valid authorization. Screening of medical and dental records
must be performed by a CMA or other medical personnel specifically trained and formally
designated to perform that function. When the records review is accomplished by other than the
CMA and raises a question or identifies potentially disqualifying information about an
individual’s physical capability or mental suitability for assignment to a PRP position, the records
shall be referred to the CMA for further evaluation or medical examination. The results of that
review by the CMA along with all PDI shall be provided to the certifying official who shall
make the determination on the individual’s eligibility to perform PRP duties.

        *C3.2.3.1. (Added)(AF) PRP reviewing and certifying officials may only have access
to portions of the medical records where the CMA has identified a possible disqualifying
condition. Access is limited to the extent necessary for the certifying official to document
the condition to make a certification/qualification determination for PRP purposes. PRP
reviewing and certifying officials are authorized to review medical records under the
guidance of a CMA.

        C3.2.3.2. (Added)(AFGSC) Actions include administrative qualification, initial
certification and interim certification of PRP members. Upon receipt of the AF Form 286
and PRP Questionnaire, the MTF monitor will identify (“flag”) the medical/dental records
as PRP (per AFI 41-210 and AFI 47-101) The MTF will continuously evaluate the patient.
When the member is medically qualified, the CMA will complete the medical evaluation
block of section II of the AF Form 286 (often referred to as the “medical qualification
date”). MTFs will annotate the following on the AF Form 745 (see C1.1.2.):

            C3.2.3.2.1. (Added)(AFGSC) The member’s unit in which he/she is being
certified in and the date qualification recommendation was completed inside the triangle.



Change 1, 11/10/2009                             41                                    CHAPTER 3
         C3.2.3.2.2. (Added)(AFGSC) All members who have a diagnosis of alcohol
dependence will be identified by a green dot located on the bottom right-hand corner of the
AF Form 745.

    C3.2.4. Personnel File Review. The individual’s personnel file, other official records, and
information locally available on behavior or conduct about the individual’s reliability shall be
reviewed in detail. Look for evidence of the individual’s acceptance of responsibility, exercise
of sound judgment, effective performance, and ability to adjust to changes in the working
environment. Personnel records shall reflect assignment of an individual to a PRP position.

    C3.2.5. Personal Interview. A personal interview shall be conducted by the certifying
official with each candidate for PRP duties. The personal interview shall not be conducted a part
of a routine orientation briefing for new personnel. PDI will be sought and, if appropriate,
discussed during this interview.

   C3.2.6. Position Qualification. Demonstrate potential for technical proficiency
commensurate with nuclear weapon and/or NC2 duty position requirements.

    *C3.2.7. (Added)(AF) ADMINISTRATIVE QUALIFICATION: A PRP screening
process which ensures active duty military personnel (excludes Guard/Reserve personnel)
meet PRP standards before they depart for training or assignment to PRP duties. This
process must be accomplished with the same criteria and standards as a certification (refer
to paras C3.2. to C3.2.6.) and with equivalent record access for a
RO/CO/commander/director. Unit Commanders/Directors need not be PRP certified to
perform administrative qualification. Administrative qualification does not apply to PRP
certified individuals transferring to another PRP position (see para, C4.4.2.4. for PRP
Transfer instructions).

       *C3.2.7.1. (Added)(AF) The losing commander will complete the Administrative
qualification within 60 days from the date member acknowledges receipt of PRP
assignment, or training notification. The gaining CO must review forwarded PDI and
return the administrative qualification decisions within 14 days of receipt of the
administrative qualification package. Gaining CO decisions are not required on packages
that do not contain PDI (see para C3.2.7.2). In certain circumstances, the identity of
gaining CO may not be known. In these special cases, the losing CC will consider any PDI
and make the administrative qualification decision. Note: At the short-tour locations,
follow-on assignment qualifications will be accomplished by the losing commander within
180 days prior to assignment departure.

           *C3.2.7.1.1. (Added)(AF) Units will use the Administrative Qualification “How-To”
checklist and have the individual complete the PRP questionnaire. The losing unit will
provide the completed questionnaire to the gaining CO. Additional tools (i.e., interview
guide, records review, PDI information sheet, training, etc.) can also be found on the AF
PRP website.




Change 1, 11/10/2009                            42                                   CHAPTER 3
           C3.2.7.1.2. (Added)(AFGSC) IAW para C1.4, C2.13.3, C3.2.3, trained and
designated personnel will document review of the dental records and any mental health
records (including ADAPT and FAP records) on the Dental PRP Qualification/Certification
and Mental Health PRP Certification SF600 overprints respectively (seeC1.1.2.). These
completed documents will be forwarded back to the Medical PRP office for CMA
adjudication and filing in section 2 of the member’s outpatient medical record.

          C3.2.7.1.3. (Added)(AFGSC) MTF PRP Clinic will print and file a copy of
AHLTA notes, PIMR/ASIMS deployment documents (e.g., DD 2795, DD 2796, DD 2900),
and any available PEPP or AIMWTS documents not already filed in the physical (paper)
outpatient medical record.

           C3.2.7.1.4. (Added)(AFGSC) IAW para C1.4, C2.13.3, C3.2.3, trained and
designated personnel will review the dental and mental health record review SF600s, PRP
Questionnaire, and outpatient medical record(s) for items that may be considered PDI.
Those findings will be documented on the Medical PRP Qualification/Certification review
SF600 (see C1.1.2). If the reviewer is not a CMA, he/she will bring forward any items that
might be PDI for CMA review. If further evaluation is desired/required, the CMA will
evaluate the member either telephonically or in person as deemed appropriate.

         C3.2.7.1.5. (Added)(AFGSC) All qualification reviews by the CMA will be
completed within 30 days.

        *C3.2.7.2. (Added)(AF) PDI. If there is no PDI, the losing commander/director will
complete the administrative qualification. If PDI is found, the Installation/Unit PRP
monitor or losing commander/director will forward the PDI to the gaining CO after records
screening and CC interview, to allow the gaining CO to review and consider acceptance. The
losing commander/director and gaining CO must personally communicate the PDI. If
gaining CO accepts, the losing commander/director completes administrative qualification.
If not accepted, gaining CO will provide rationale relevant to PRP standards and losing
commander/director will annotate/update disqualification. Once the individual is
administratively qualified, continuous monitoring procedures as outlined in paragraph
C3.2.7.4. will apply. Any time prior to certification in the PRP, if mandatory disqualifying
information (see para C5.3.2.) is found, the candidate must be permanently disqualified
using the AF Form 286A.

           *C3.2.7.2.1. (Added)(AF) Record Screening. The screening process includes
security review, medical evaluation, personnel file review and interview (see para C3.3.3. -
C3.3.4). Administrative qualification records screening for previously PRP certified
individuals need only screen since last performed PRP duties (see Table 2 - Code J).

               *C3.2.7.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) Individual must have a current security clearance
as outlined in paragraph C3.3.1.1. or C3.3.1.2. If individual does not possess a valid
security investigation, or the PR is over 4.5 years prior to member’s departure date, a
security investigation or PR must be submitted prior to completing administrative
qualification.


Change 1, 11/10/2009                         43                                 CHAPTER 3
           C3.2.7.2.2. (Added)(AFGSC) PDI letters must be either written by a CMA or, if
not written by a CMA, must be reviewed and co-signed by a CMA, then sent to the CO in a
sealed envelope.

              C3.2.7.2.2.1. (Added)(AFGSC) Trained and designated personnel will notify
the unit monitor of any PDI letter posted and will document when the unit monitor picks
up the sealed envelope. Note: If the PDI is time sensitive, the CMA may elect to forward
the PDI to the CO via encrypted email, by telephone or in person but should follow this
transmission of PDI with a written PDI letter if desired by the CO.

               C3.2.7.2.2.2. (Added)(AFGSC) MTF PRP personnel will file a copy of the
PDI letter in Part 3 of the outpatient medical record and will record the release of the PDI
letter on a HIPAA log either online or by paper copy. The copy of the PDI letter will be
tabbed along the bottom edge of the note using black tape/tabs for PDI of a Mental Health,
ADAPT and FAP nature, and red tape/tabs for all other PDI. The record is filed after final
review.

     *C3.2.7.3. (Added)(AF) Documentation. The qualification or disqualification is
documented on the AF Form 286 and permanent disqualification on the AF Form 286A.

            *C3.2.7.3.1. (Added)(AF) Qualification.        Complete the applicable portions of
the AF Form 286 (Sections I & II). Maintain an electronic record on file six months from
the date of the RNLTD or until verified as received by the gaining installation, whichever is
later. For individuals administratively qualified then subsequently sent to a non-PRP
assignment, the losing unit must maintain the electronic record for six months after the
RNLTD. Electronically send completed AF Form 286 to the gaining installation PRP monitor
for use in certification. Follow additional disposition instructions according to reference
[ff] PSD Guide - PRP. Ensure PDS is updated with PRP status code (see Table 2). Ensure all
personnel and medical records are labeled “PRP”.

            *C3.2.7.3.2. (Added)(AF) Disqualification/Permanent Disqualification. The losing
commander will complete the AF Form 286 (disqualification)/AF Form 286A (permanent
disqualification). Additionally, the losing commander will make the necessary notifications
to cancel the training and/or assignment. The Installation/Unit PRP monitor will forward
the applicable form to AFPC PRP processing utilizing CMS. Maintain an electronic copy
on file until original is verified and filed in the member’s Official Military Personnel File
(OMPF). Follow additional disposition instructions according to reference [ff] PSD Guide -
PRP. Ensure PDS is updated with PRP status code (see Table 2).

        *C3.2.7.4. (Added)(AF) Continuous Monitoring. Once administrative qualification is
complete, continuous monitoring is required. Continuous monitoring is the process for
ensuring the individual maintains PRP assignment eligibility while in training and enroute
for assignment.

           *C3.2.7.4.1. (Added)(AF) The losing CC will continue to pass to the gaining CO any
PDI or situation that may affect the individual’s PRP assignment eligibility.


Change 1, 11/10/2009                          44                                 CHAPTER 3
           *C3.2.7.4.2. (Added)(AF) The CMA will pass to the losing commander, any
medical condition requiring the generation of an AF Form 469. This does not relieve the
MTF of their responsibility to pass any medical condition that is normally reported to a
commander (e.g. ARI, alcohol abuse, depression, suicide attempts/threat, prior drug use, etc.).
Medical issues that do not meet the criteria of an AF Form 469 will not be passed to the losing
CC or forwarded to the gaining CO.

           *C3.2.7.4.3. (Added)(AF) The individual, once administratively qualified, will
adhere to the following roles and responsibilities:

               *C3.2.7.4.3.1. (Added)(AF) Be responsible for monitoring their own reliability
and the reliability of others administratively qualified. This is a 24 hours per day, seven days
per week responsibility. Failure to adhere to these responsibilities may cast doubt on an
individual’s reliability.

             *C3.2.7.4.3.2. (Added)(AF) Be aware of how problems, concerns, and
circumstances may reduce individual effectiveness and impair capability or reliability.

              *C3.2.7.4.3.3. (Added)(AF) Advise the losing commander of any factors that
could have an adverse impact on his/her PRP assignment.

               *C3.2.7.4.3.4. (Added)(AF) Inform support agencies of his/her administrative
qualification PRP status before treatment or consultation.

                *C3.2.7.4.3.5. (Added)(AF) Inform commander when other PRP
administratively qualified, interim certified or certified individual(s) appear to be involved in
situations that may affect reliability.

           C3.2.7.5. (Added)(AF) CAT I Discrepancy Reporting. The gaining CO or MPS
reports all administrative qualification discrepancies within 60 days of member’s RNLTD.
Discrepancies that delay certification or results in permanent disqualification will be reported
as “mission impact.” Report discrepancies to the losing commander/director, MPS,
FSS/CC/CL, MTF/CC (health-related), with informational addressees to the losing wing
commander/director (mission impact only), losing/gaining MAJCOM PRP (and
SGP/SGO if health-related), ARC (if applicable), HQ AFPC/DPSSMF (Future Operations)
and AF/A10-O (prp@pentagon.af.mil).

C3.3. INITIAL CERTIFICATION

   C3.3.1. Personnel Security Investigation and Eligibility Requirements

        C3.3.1.1. Critical Position. Top Secret eligibility based on an SSBI, or SSBI-PR, Phased
Periodic Review Reinvestigation (PPR), or Tier 3 Investigation completed within the last 5 years and
favorably adjudicated within the last 5 years. If appropriate, a review of the results of the
investigation shall be conducted by the certifying official. If it becomes necessary to consider an
individual for a critical position and the required investigation has not been completed, interim


Change 1, 11/10/2009                            45                                    CHAPTER 3
certification may be made (see paragraph C3.4). (Added)(AF) Use the completion date of the last
investigation to determine eligibility.

        C3.3.1.2. Controlled Position. Secret eligibility based on a NACLC, ANACI, or SPR
completed and adjudicated within the last 5 years or a favorably adjudicated SSBI, SSBI-PR,
SBI, SBI-PR, BI, BI-PR within the last 5 years. Secret eligibility based on a NACLC, ANACI,
Secret eligibility based on a NACLC, ANACI, Secret Periodic Reinvestigation (SPR), SSBI, SSBI-PR,
PPR, Special Background Investigation (SBI), SBI-PR, Background Investigation (BI), BI-PR, or
Tier 2 Investigation completed within the last 5 years and favorably adjudicated. If it becomes
necessary to consider an individual for a controlled position and the required investigation has
not been completed, interim certification may be made (see paragraph C3.4). (Added)(AF) Use
the completion date of the last investigation to determine eligibility.

       C3.3.1.3. Fulfilling Investigative Requirements

           C3.3.1.3.1. Periodic reinvestigations are required every 5 years for both critical and
controlled positions. Investigations determined to meet PRP position requirements under
previous guidance remain valid.

            C3.3.1.3.2. New Federal Investigative Standards issued by the Security Executive
Agent, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Suitability Executive Agent, Office
of Personnel Management (Reference (p)) will replace the traditional PR with a “Continuous
Evaluation/Reinvestigation” process. Until these new standards are implemented, agencies will
continue to use the existing investigative standards in Director of Central Intelligence Directive
6/4 (Reference (q)) until the planned implementation date.

             *C3.3.1.3.3 (Added)(AF) The JPAS, or confirmation from the AFCAF, is the
official source for validating currency of PSIs. Reference previous OASD guidance (also see
para C3.4.1.2. and C3.4.2.2.), individuals with PSI over 5 years (using the completion date
of the last investigation) who are currently certified in the PRP, including those certified under
the OASD waiver may remain certified, if:

               *C3.3.1.3.3.1. (Added)(AF) The periodic reinvestigation is submitted and

              C3.3.1.3.3.2. (Added)(AF) The CO has reviewed the completed security
questionnaire and is satisfied there is no known risk.

           C3.3.1.4. The DoD Components may establish procedures to facilitate the timely
screening of individuals required to support their wartime missions. Cost effectiveness should be
considered in the implementation of DoD Component programs. (Added)(AF) All screening
procedures developed to support wartime missions will be coordinated through AF/A10-O.
(Added)(AFGSC) Due to possible time constraints, the following at a minimum must be
accomplished: Contingency PRP Questionnaire (seeC.1.1.2.), CMA recommendation, and
Spirit & Intent given by losing/gaining CO.

   C3.3.2. Medical Evaluation

Change 1, 11/10/2009                            46                                    CHAPTER 3
        C3.3.2.1. As part of the required screening process, medical histories and records, if they
are sufficiently comprehensive and current for the purpose, shall be evaluated to determine the
candidate’s physical and mental qualifications under the standards for the PRP. Personnel
considered for or holding PRP positions shall make all medical records available to the certifying
official for initial and subsequent screening requirements and for inspection. See paragraph
C3.3.2.1.3 below for restrictions on access to medical records for certifying and reviewing
officials.

            C3.3.2.1.1. Screening of medical records must be performed by a CMA or other medical
personnel specifically trained and formally designated to perform that function. When the records
review is accomplished by other than the CMA and raises a question or identifies potentially
disqualifying information about an individual’s physical capability or mental suitability for
assignment to a PRP position, the records shall be referred to the CMA for further evaluation or
medical examination. The results of that review by the CMA along with all PDI shall be
provided to the certifying official who shall make the determination on the individual’s eligibility to
perform PRP duties.

            C3.3.2.1.2. If available medical records are inadequate; the CMA shall conduct an
evaluation to determine medical qualification under PRP standards. That medical evaluation
shall include a mental health consultation when indicated. All PDI of a medical nature shall be
documented in the individual’s medical records.

            C3.3.2.1.3. PRP certifying and reviewing officials are partially authorized to review
medical records of candidates and members of the PRP to make determinations required by this
Regulation. According to Reference (g), DoD medical records may be disclosed to reviewing and
certifying officials for this purpose without either a request from, or the consent of, the
individuals to whom those records pertain. PRP certifying and reviewing officials may only have
access to portions of the medical records where the CMA has identified a possible disqualifying
condition. Access is limited to the extent necessary for the certifying or reviewing official to
document the condition to make a certification/qualification determination for PRP purposes. All
PDI of a medical nature shall be documented in the individual’s medical records.

            C3.3.2.1.4. C3.3.2.1.3. Because of the sensitive and confidential nature of the records,
access shall extend only to the reviewing and certifying officials and designated PRP inspectors
(see DL.34) consistent with Reference (l). Such review shall be conducted with the assistance of
a healthcare provider who can advise on medical record data that might otherwise be
misinterpreted. See paragraph C3.3.2.1.3. for restrictions on access to medical records for
certifying and reviewing officials.

              *C3.3.2.1.3.1. (Added)(AF) Such review shall be conducted with the assistance of
a healthcare provider (CMA) who can advise on medical record data that might otherwise be
misinterpreted.

            *C3.3.2.1.4. (Added)(AF) Access is limited to the extent necessary for the
certifying or reviewing official to document the condition to make a certification/ qualification

Change 1, 11/10/2009                              47                                      CHAPTER 3
determination for PRP purposes. PRP reviewing and certifying officials are partially
authorized to review medical records of candidates and members of the PRP to make
determinations required by this Regulation. According to Reference (l), DoD medical records
may be disclosed to reviewing and certifying officials for this purpose without either a request
from, or the consent of, the individuals to whom those records pertain. PRP certifying and
reviewing officials may only have access to portions of the medical records where the CMA
has identified a possible disqualifying condition. All PDI of a medical nature shall be
documented in the individual’s medical records. PRP certifying officials are authorized to
review medical records under the guidance of a CMA.

        C3.3.2.2. (Added)(AFGSC) When administratively qualified PRP personnel are
projected inbound, the Lead CMA (SGP) or designated alternate should receive email
notification from the losing base when an AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report, is
created on that member (AFI 10-203, para 2.10, “Duty Limiting Conditions”). If a AF Form
469 is received from the losing MTF the following will apply:

           C3.3.2.2.1. (Added)(AFGSC) The gaining Lead CMA or P-CMA will ensure that
the patient is entered into a local tracking database.

           C3.3.2.2.2. (Added)(AFGSC) Trained and designated personnel will monitor
AHLTA monthly to identify any PDI that might reasonably impact certification. When
PDI of this nature is identified, a CMA will pass the PDI to the gaining CO.

           C3.3.2.2.3. (Added)(AFGSC) The MTF POWG will track these incoming PRP
members until that member in-processes into the gaining MTF. If the member has not in-
processed within 60 days of being entered into the database, the gaining MTF should
contact the gaining unit to determine the assignment status of the Airman. If it is
confirmed that the member is still projected inbound, the MTF POWG will continue to
track that member every 60 days until inprocessed. If the assignment has been cancelled,
unit must notify MTF.

       C3.3.2.3. (Added)(AFGSC) PRP Monthly Activity Report (seeC.1.1.2.) and other
metrics deemed beneficial by the MTF/CC, Lead CMA or P-CMA will be followed by the
MTF POWG to discern trends or problem areas in the MTF’s program. Metrics will be
reported to AFGSC/SGP at the end of each month, but no later than the end of the first
week of the subsequent month.

    C3.3.3. Personnel File Review. The individual’s personnel file, other official records, and
information locally available on behavior or conduct about the individual’s reliability shall be
reviewed in detail. Look for evidence of the individual’s acceptance of responsibility, exercise
of sound judgment, effective performance, and ability to adjust to changes in the working
environment.

    C3.3.4. Personal Interview. A personal interview by the certifying official shall inform the
individual of the significance of the assignment, PRP standards, the need for reliable
performance, the individual’s responsibility for self-reporting and peer review of factors and

Change 1, 11/10/2009                             48                                    CHAPTER 3
situations that could adversely affect job performance or reliability. The certifying official will
also provide the individual the opportunity to disclose any PDI.

    C3.3.5. Proficiency Qualification. It shall be certified that the individual has had the formal
course of instruction and/or possesses the minimum level of experience required for assignment
to a particular critical or controlled PRP position.

    C3.3.6. Potentially Disqualifying Information (PDI). Central Adjudication Facilities for
military and DoD civilians or the DISCO DSS for contractor personnel, will forward all PDI, as
defined in Chapter 5 of this Regulation, on PRP individuals to the appropriate certifying
official/security manager. The certifying official will review this information and determine if
the individual’s reliability is affected and take appropriate actions. PDI previously addressed,
documented, and determined not to be disqualifying for PRP assignment need not be re-addressed or
require additional documentation unless warranted by subsequent disqualifying information. The
appropriate certifying official/security manager shall record a servicing relationship within the
DoD designated personnel security information system of record and indicate the appropriate
contact information so that the adjudication facility knows the appropriate location to send PDI.

        *C3.3.6.1. (Added)(AF) If PDI is discovered during the reviewing process that
cannot be proven to be previously adjudicated, treat this information as new PDI and
adjudicate accordingly. This provision applies to PDI that occurred either before or after
and individual has been certified in the PRP. (Added)(AFGSC) Reference C3.2.7.2.2. for PDI
letter procedures.

    *C3.3.7. (Added)(AF) Certification Documentation. The certification is documented on
the AF Form 286. Forward the AF Form 286 to AFPC PRP Processing utilizing the Case
Management System (CMS), for filing in the individual’s personnel record. For Guard
and Reserve personnel forward the AF Form 286 to the Air Reserve Personnel Center
(ARPC). Reference the PRP PSD Guide for specific form disposition instructions. The
PDS is updated with a PRP status code (see Table 2) and the date the CO certified the
individual. Ensure all medical and personnel records are labeled “PRP.”

C3.4. INTERIM CERTIFICATION

   C3.4.1. Critical Position. If it becomes necessary to consider an individual for a critical
position and the required investigation has not been completed, interim certification may be
made under the following conditions:

         C3.4.1.1. For interim critical certification, the individual must have either Secret
eligibility based on an investigation completed and adjudicated investigation within the last 5
years and favorably adjudicated, or Top Secret eligibility based on an investigation completed
and adjudicated investigation no more than 10 years ago and favorably adjudicated, without a
break in active Federal service or employment longer than 2 years. (Added)(AF) Also ensure
steps outlined in C3.4.1.2 have been completed or

        C3.4.1.2. The SSBI or Tier 3 request shall have been submitted prior to interim
certification and all other requirements of the PRP screening process shall have been fulfilled.

(Added)(AF) This includes the CO granting an interim clearance equivalent to the PRP
position, reviewing the completed security questionnaire and being satisfied there is no
known risk.

           *C3.4.1.2.1. (Added)(AF) The request shall be submitted, accepted and opened
by OPM.

   C3.4.2 Controlled Position. If it becomes necessary to consider an individual for a
controlled position and the required investigation has not been completed, interim certification
may be made under the following conditions:

         C3.4.2.1. For interim controlled certification, the individual must have clearance Secret
eligibility based on an investigation which has been completed within the last 10 years and
favorably adjudicated within the last 10 years without a break in service over 2 years.
(Added)(AF) (10 year period is based on the completion date of the last investigation), and
steps outlined in C3.4.2.2 have been completed or

         C3.4.2.2. The NACLC, ANACI, or SPR or Tier 2 shall have been submitted prior to
interim certification and all other requirements for the PRP screening process shall have been
fulfilled. (Added)(AF) This includes the CO granting an interim clearance equivalent to the
PRP position, reviewing the completed security questionnaire and being satisfied there is
no known risk.

           *C3.4.2.2.1. (Added)(AF) The request shall be submitted to OPM.

   C3.4.3. Individuals with Interim Certification

        C3.4.3.1. These individuals shall be identified to supervisory personnel, entry controllers
who directly control access to exclusion areas, and others as necessary, as having only interim
certification. Entry authorization lists and individual access media shall be specifically marked
to designate interim certification status.

       C3.4.3.2. An individual with interim certification shall not be paired in a two-person team
with another individual also having only an interim PRP certification.

    C3.4.4. (Added)(AF) If the individual is not eligible for interim certification, or the CO
determines not to interim certify, update PDS with PRP status code “C” until the security
clearance determination is made and updated by the AFCAF.

   *C3.4.5. (Added)(AF) Interim Certification Documentation. Document an interim
certification using the same procedure as a certification (refer to para C3.3.7.).

C3.5. PERSONNEL TRANSFER

    *C3.5.1. PRP-certified Individual. When a PRP-certified individual is transferred to another
PRP position, he or she must be interviewed by the new certifying official. If this transfer does
not involve a change in the reviewing official, a rescreening of the medical and personnel records
Change 1, 11/10/2009                            50                                    CHAPTER 3
is not required. If this transfer results in a change of both certifying and reviewing officials, a
rescreening of the medical and personnel records shall be conducted. (Added)(AF) Rescreen
from the last day individual performed PRP duties to present. If the transfer does not involve
the change of the reviewing official a new AF Form 286 is not required. (Added)(AFGSC)
Document personnel interview using the Status Change Checklist (see C.1.1.2.).

       *C3.5.1.1. (Added)(AF) PRP to PRP transfer. Administrative qualification does not
apply. When a PRP-certified individual transfers to another PRP position resulting in the
change of RO and CO, the losing installation updates PDS with PRP status code B (date
member last performed PRP duties). Gaining unit documents, on a new AF Form 286, the
rescreening requirements identified in paragraph C4.4.2.4.1. Forward the AF Form 286 to
AFPC PRP processing utilizing the Case Management System (CMS), for filing in the
individual’s OMPF.

        *C3.5.1.2. (Added)(AF) When a PRP-certified (includes Interim and Additional Duty)
individual is transferred to a non-PRP position and no longer requires the PRP, the
certification shall administratively terminate (refer to para C5.3.). Update PDS (PRP
Status Code J) with the date last performed PRP (see Table 2).

    *C3.5.2. PDI. PDI previously addressed, documented, and determined not to be disqualifying
for PRP assignment need not be re-addressed or require additional documentation unless
warranted by subsequent disqualifying information. (Added)(AF) If at any time PDI is
discovered during the reviewing process either before or after an individual is certified in the
PRP that cannot be proven to be previously adjudicated treat this information as new PDI
and adjudicate accordingly. (Added)(AFGSC) Reference C3.2.7.2.2. for PDI letter
procedures




Change 1, 11/10/2009                            51                                    CHAPTER 3

                                    CONTINUING EVALUATION

C4.1. GENERAL

Certifying officials are responsible for ensuring that all military, civilian, and contractor
personnel assigned to PRP positions meet all of the requirements of the continuing evaluation
process. Certifying officials must also observe the behavior and performance of members
certified under the PRP on a frequent and consistent basis. The primary consideration for
certifying officials should be that the sum of the observation, both personal and through peer
observation and reporting, is sufficiently detailed to allow for close evaluation of the individual.
Observation of performance and behavior need not be limited to duty in a single capacity. While
observation of PRP duties should be primary, additional observation when not executing PRP
duties as a government civilian employee, a private contractor to the Government, a military
service member, or a combination of these can also serve to add to the certifying official’s
evaluation.

C4.2. MINIMUM STANDARDS

Members whose permanent duty assignments do not permit routine observation/peer reporting
on a day-to-day basis must be monitored with particular diligence. For those personnel whose
normal duties or assignments do not provide for routine observation (excluding periods of
administrative absence (leave/pass/temporary duty, TDY, or TAD)), certifying officials must
demonstrate an ability to maintain an equivalent level of confidence in the reliability of those
members as would be available through routine, day-to-day contact and peer reporting.
Individuals certified under PRP must be aware and agree that certain information/materials
concerning their activities (medical, mental health, police, employment records, credit reports,
etc.) both on- and off-duty, are to be provided for review voluntarily to certifying officials,
CMAs, and inspectors and that failure to provide the requested materials may result in
suspension or decertification. (Added)(AF) In most cases, individuals going TDY and
performing PRP duties remain certified under their current CO.

    *C4.2.1. Certification for personnel who do not meet the requirements for routine
observation as described above, but who the certifying official believes should be certified,
require evaluation and approval by the Commander of the Combatant Command or the respective
Chief of the Military Service or designated representative. The approval authority may be delegated
in writing to a single official of at least O-7/SES grade on the staff. All exceptions will be
submitted for review on a quarterly basis to ATSD(NCB)/NM. The certifying official will
submit a specific plan outlining the application of the tools outlined in paragraph C4.2.2.,
tailored to the circumstances of the individual being considered that provides for the equivalent
level of confidence mentioned above. This provision does not apply to the certification of
certifying officials, who must meet the minimum standards for continuing evaluation in
paragraph C4.2. (Added)(AF) The AF appointed approval authority is AF/A10.

   C4.2.2. For periods in which a PRP-certified individual was not subject to continuing
evaluation, the certifying official must ensure the individual’s reliability during these times meets

Change 1, 11/10/2009                              52                                     CHAPTER 4
the requirements of this Regulation. The certifying official will employ additional means and
methods sufficient to assist in that determination, e.g., an additional personal interview, periodic
medical records review, additional drug screening, contact with civilian employer of Selected
Reserve personnel or previous supervisor, service/personnel records review, periodic criminal
records/history checks, and credit checks. When selected randomly for drug screening, personnel
will be required to submit to testing upon return to duty.

        *C4.2.2.1. (Added)(AF) Individuals who exceed 60 calendar days without performing
official duty/training will be removed from PRP duties (Table 2, PDS Code G) and entry
control authorities will be notified. Upon return, the individual’s personnel, medical will be
screened for PDI (back to date of G code) and the Certifying Official (CO) will conduct an
interview.

       *C4.2.2.2. (Added)(AF) All PRP personnel who do not meet the criteria of routine
observation are required to provide their medical (civilian and military) to the Competent
Medical Authority (CMA). This includes personnel whose primary source of medical care is
not the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) or Tricare, or, whose treatment is not
organically tracked by the MTF.

          *C4.2.2.2.1. (Added)(AF) Routine healthcare documentation will be submitted to the
CO/CMA as early as possible, but, no later than 5 days prior to their next PRP event. For
unscheduled/emergent medical/dental care, the individual or their representative will notify
the CO or CMA within two days.

           *C4.2.2.2.2. (Added)(AF) MTFs. The MTF will query all medical insurance,
dental insurance and pharmacy insurance companies for claims and payment information
every six months, at a minimum, for all PRP personnel who do not meet the criteria for
routine observation. MTFs will maintain a copy of the request and responses in the
individual’s medical record. After 90 days from the request date, if no response is received
the MTF will document “No Response Received” on the original request form. If there is a
disparity in the information received, the CMA will forward that PDI to the CO to
adjudicate and decide the best course of action.

    *C4.2.3. (Added)(AF) PRP-certified individuals deployed/TDY (not required for
administrative absence, e.g. BDE, Academy training, etc.) for over 30 days who will not be
performing PRP duties and continuous evaluation procedures are not available at
deployed/TDY location are not required to contact their certifying official prior to medical
care. Upon return, the individuals’ records will be screened for PDI (back to date of K
code) and the CO will conduct an interview; this screening and interview will be documented.
Individuals are responsible for informing their CO of any situation that may affect their
reliability under PRP. Recertification is not required. (Table 2, PDS code K)

   C4.2.4. (Added)(AFGSC). When a deploying PRP member is identified by Public
Health (PH) for Pre-Deployment processing, the MTF will complete the following actions
and annotate on a Pre-Deployment SF600 overprint:



Change 1, 11/10/2009                            53                                    CHAPTER 4
        C4.2.4.1. (Added)(AFGSC) The PRP member’s medical information via the
medical readiness tracking website/database will be screened by PH personnel to determine
if the member is medically qualified to deploy. If the member is deemed not medically
qualified for the deployment, the reviewer will direct/facilitate appropriate follow-up as
required. A CMA will review any new medical documentation and ensure appropriate
notification (e.g., suspension recommendation) is made and any PDI is passed to the CO.
The DD Form 2766 is then returned to PH.

        C4.2.4.2. (Added)(AFGSC) If the member is deemed medically qualified to deploy
by PH, specially trained and designated personnel in the PRP clinic will review the PH
forms for any PRP issues. If no PRP issues are identified, the completed SF600 and DD
Form 2766 will be forwarded back to PH. If the record reviewer identifies any PRP issue,
a CMA will make a PRP disposition, appropriate notification, and determine if the
member continues to be medically cleared for the deployment. If no longer medically
cleared for deployment, any appropriate follow-up will be directed, and the DD Form 2766
will be returned to PH. If the CMA deems the member is still medically cleared for the
deployment, the completed SF600 and DD Form 2766 will be forwarded to PH.

          C4.2.4.2.1. (Added)(AFGSC) When a PRP member is medically cleared for
deployment, the PRP Clinic will complete the following prior to forwarding the DD Form
2766 to PH:

               C4.2.4.2.1.1. (Added)(AFGSC) Copy the DD Form 2766 and file the copy in
Part 1 of the outpatient record.

   C4.2.5. (Added)(AFGSC) PH will determine whether or not individuals returning from
deployment are on PRP. The following actions apply to returning PRP members:

      C4.2.5.1. (Added)(AFGSC) The completed Post-Deployment/TDY Questionnaire,
DD Form 2766 including any Post-Deployment Health Assessments (PDHA), and any other
medical documentation filed in the DD Form 2766 or in AHLTA are to be screened for
PDI. These documents must be reviewed by a CMA and undergo final review in
accordance with paragraph C4.4.2.7 before being filed in the outpatient medical record.
Regardless of K-code status, the CMA will use this questionnaire for members returning
from deployment.

       C4.2.5.2. (Added)(AFGSC) If the CMA finds no new PDI, the MTF will make an
appropriate notification to the unit (e.g., “RTD from the deployment/K-code”). If new PDI
is found, the CMA will pass the PDI and make the appropriate notification to the unit (e.g.,
“RTD from the deployment/K-code. Recommend suspend XX-days for [reason]).”

    C4.2.6. (Added)(AFGSC) Post-Deployment Health Re-Assessments (PDHRA) will also
be screened for PRP issues. These documents will be screened by specially trained and
designated personnel before or by a CMA, after which the documents undergo final review
in accordance with paragraph C4.4.2.7. The record is then filed in the outpatient medical



Change 1, 11/10/2009                         54                                CHAPTER 4
record. If any new PDI is found, the CMA will ensure the PDI is passed and any
appropriate notifications to the unit are made IAW paragraphs C4.4.1, C4.4.2.

C4.3. PSI
All civilian, contractor, active duty military, and Selected Reserve personnel assigned to PRP
positions shall be subject to a PR every 5 years, according to Reference (ef). The following
applies:

   C4.3.1. Personnel assigned to serve in PRP positions will have a PSI PR submitted every 5
years regardless of when they were last certified into the PRP.

   C4.3.2. A break in Federal service or Government employment exceeding 2 years, and, for
contractor employees a break in status exceeding 2 years. (Added)(AF) requires a new PSI.

    C4.3.3. The certifying official may request a new PSI based on significant derogatory
information or allegations. (Added)(AF) The certifying official may request an RSI
(Reimbursable Suitability/Security Investigation) to resolve issues.

   C4.3.4. Reference (p) will replace the traditional PR with a “Continuous
Evaluation/Reinvestigation” process. Until these new standards are implemented, agencies will
continue to use the existing standards in Reference (q) until the planned implementation date. Once
implemented the new frequency is:

         C4.3.4.1. At least 20 percent of subjects in Tier 2 appointed to positions that require
eligibility for access to “L" information, Confidential information, and Secret information shall be
reevaluated annually, with 100 percent being reevaluated at least once every 5 years and on an
a periodic basis or as event-driven, subject to implementing guidance.

        C4.3.4.2. Subjects in Tier 3 appointed to positions that require eligibility for access to
“Q” information, Top Secret information, or SCI shall be reevaluated annually or as event
driven, subject to implementing guidance.

C4.4. MEDICAL EVALUATION

    C4.4.1. Each time a PRP-certified individual receives a medical evaluation and/or treatment
that may impact performance or reliability, the CMA must determine PRP reliability effects and,
if warranted, make recommendations to the certifying official. IDCs on submarines that are
underway will ensure the certifying official is apprised of any medical treatment that might affect
PRP performance and upon return to homeport, the CMA will review all treatment which could
potentially impact PRP performance. Additionally, the Services DoD Components are
authorized to establish protocols that may be applied by IDMTs at Munitions Support Squadrons
and by IDCs on submarines that do not require CMA review. When an individual’s duty
performance may be impaired by medical care or the use of prescribed medication, as determined
by the CMA, the certifying official shall be notified to decide if the individual shall be suspended
from duty involving nuclear weapons for the period of medical care or use of medication.
(Added)(AF) The duration of the member’s suspension from PRP duties should be for the
period of time that they are at increased risk for impairment. The CMA can recommend to
Change 1, 11/10/2009                             55                                     CHAPTER 4
the CO to return a member to PRP duties prior to the completion of medical care or use of
prescribed medication if the member has no impairment that impacts their performance or
reliability.

       *C4.4.1.2. (Added)(AF) At GSUs without a CMA, the IDMT consults the CMA
(IDMT documents date and name of CMA in the medical record) and then provides the
PRP recommendation to the CO; during medical SAVs (Reference [v]), the CMA will
review all PRP recommendations provided by the IDMT).

    C4.4.2. The certifying official shall be notified immediately by the CMA when a significant
effect on the individual’s physical or mental abilities is expected or if an individual’s behavior
indicates emotional instability, drug or alcohol abuse, or the need for treatment with narcotics,
sedatives, tranquilizers, or other drugs that could impair perception or performance. If an
individual’s reliability is not in question, the certifying official shall assess the individual’s condition,
obtain a medical evaluation of the potential effects of any medication or treatment that may have
been prescribed or purchased over-the-counter, discuss with the individual the previous effects of
such medication or treatment, if appropriate, and then decide if either suspension, decertification,
or return to PRP duties is appropriate. If there is a doubt or disagreement among healthcare
providers about an individual’s reliability, the certifying official shall be notified and provided
sufficient information to make the final PRP determination. (Added)(AF) The PRP
recommendation of a CMA will take precedence over that of a non CMA healthcare provider.

        C4.4.2.1. (Added)(AF) Contractor individuals shall report health visits or
medication changes to the contractor PRP monitor who then notifies the contracted CMA.
The contracted CMA reviews the medical information and provides a PRP recommendation
to the CO.

      *C4.4.2.2. (Added)(AF) The CO submits all contractor employee self-identified medical
treatment and evaluation to the contracted CMA for evaluation. If the contract allows it, the
CO may delegate this function to the contractor PRP monitor. The CMA makes a PRP
recommendation to the CO.

         C4.4.2.3. (Added)(AFGSC) For MTF care within the PRP clinic the following will
apply:

           C4.4.2.3.1. (Added)(AFGSC) If no PDI is identified and there is no
recommended action required, the CMA may authorize the release of the patient. After
the provider signs, the note be printed, filed in the medical record, and sent for final record
review in accordance with paragraph C4.4.2.7.

          C4.4.2.3.2. (Added)(AFGSC) If PDI is present, disposition will be made by the
provider (CMA), reviewed by trained and designated personnel and notification will be
made to the unit. After review/notification, the member may be released (this only applies
to the PRP clinic). Upon completion, the note will be signed, printed and filed in the
medical record. The PDI will be passed to the CO IAW paragraph, C3.2.7.2.2.



Change 1, 11/10/2009                                 56                                       CHAPTER 4
       C4.4.2.4. (Added)(AFGSC) For care outside the PRP clinic (e.g. non-PRP clinic
MTF visits), the PRP-certified member will check into the PRP clinic’s records section to
obtain his/her medical record. The member will proceed to the treating clinic with the
medical record (when available) either in a secured device or by patient escort.

           C4.4.2.4.1. (Added)(AFGSC) After the visit, the member will report back to the
PRP clinic bringing the medical record with the completed note from the treating clinic. A
CMA or specially trained and designated personnel will review the note for PDI and
determine if notification for recommended action (e.g., suspend, RTD) is required. After
the patient is released, the record will undergo final record review IAW paragraph
C4.4.2.7.

      C4.4.2.5. (Added)(AFGSC) The dental clinic, whether physically co-located within
the MTF or elsewhere, will follow the treatment operations guidelines for MTF care within
the PRP clinic provided the dental clinic has an infrastructure in place (i.e., dental CMAs
and specially trained and designated personnel authorized to review dental PRP records
and make notifications to the unit).

      C4.4.2.6. (Added)(AFGSC) Telephone Consults (T-Con). When a telephone consult
on a PRP patient is generated, it must be reviewed by a PRP Clinic staff member who will
document the interview with the patient in AHLTA using the standardized T-Con format.
Trained and designated personnel will review the T-Con for potential PRP issues.

          C4.4.2.6.1. (Added)(AFGSC) If no PRP issues are identified, the T-Con will be
reviewed by a CMA before being filed in the patient’s chart.

            C4.4.2.6.2. (Added)(AFGSC) If the PRP Clinic staff identifies a potential PRP
issue, the staff member will consult a CMA to make a PRP disposition. If the CMA agrees
there is a potential PRP issue/impairment, the CMA will direct the appropriate notification
action and pass any PDI to the unit IAW paragraph C3.2.7.2.2.

           C4.4.2.6.3. (Added)(AFGSC) If PDI notification is required; trained and
designated personnel will enter the information he/she passes from the CMA’s disposition,
time of notification, the name of the unit personnel notified, and the person making the
notification. These entries are to be annotated at the end of the AHLTA note or as an
addendum to the AHLTA note. This annotation may be accomplished by manually
printing the information at the end of the AHLTA note, but the intent is to document this
information in electronic format.

           C4.4.2.6.4. (Added)(AFGSC) When AHLTA is not available or is not being used
by the treating clinic, documentation of PRP notifications will be completed using a manual
standardized PRP stamp (see C1.1.2.). This stamp may also be used for any non-clinic
encounters (e.g., occupational forms, off-base results when a notification is required). The
time notification is made should also be documented on the stamp.

        C4.4.2.7. (Added)(AFGSC) All clinical encounters generated each day require a
final review for any missed PDI or PRP issues. This should be done by specially trained

Change 1, 11/10/2009                        57                                 CHAPTER 4
and designated personnel before the record is filed. If neither the encounter nor final
review was performed by a CMA, a CMA will review the encounter before the record is
filed.

    4.4.3. When a PRP-certified individual receives any private, has received non-military
medical or dental treatment and/or evaluation (including TRICARE and Civilian Health and
Medical Program of the Uniformed Services referrals) that may impact performance or
reliability, he or she will report treatment and/or evaluation to the CMA or certifying official
and. Additionally, the individual will provide appropriate documentation, when available, to the
CMA, who shall consult the certifying official if required. (Added)(AF) The CMA shall review
and determine the effect of the care on the individual. The results of that CMA evaluation
shall be recorded in the individual’s medical record and the CO shall be notified.

       *C4.4.3.1. (Added)(AF) Each MTF will establish procedures to review medical
information brought in by members who have sought care outside the MTF or sent by a health
care agency outside the MTF. The use of standardized forms or electronic health record
templates to facilitate documentation is encouraged. Prescriptions from non-military
providers to PRP individuals will not be filled nor will medication be dispensed automatically
through the MTF pharmacy without an indication that the record has undergone the
required PRP review. The CMA makes a PRP recommendation to the CO.

       C4.4.3.2. (Added)(AFGSC) If the member returns to the PRP clinic after a non-
military medical or dental visit but does not bring a completed Medical Information Letter
(orange sheet), and there is no other sufficient documentation of the visit available for
CMA review, the CMA will evaluate the member in a documented encounter and make a
PRP disposition/recommendation to the CO.

        C4.4.3.3. (Added)(AFGSC) Units with a Total Force Integration (TFI) mission
requiring members of AFRC/ANG to be PRP certified will follow the procedures as noted
in C4.4.3.2. Use of the Release of Medical Information Letter (orange sheet), when
deemed advantageous by the AFRC/ANG medical unit’s SGP (or Primary CMA if the SGP
is not CMA trained and designated), may be modified to account for AFRC/ANG specific
information. Any locally developed downtown appointment form will contain at a
minimum the information included on the orange sheet.

      C4.4.3.4. (Added)(AFGSC) The AFRC/ANG medical unit will establish avenues of
communication from outside the local area (i.e., electronic/email, fax) for PRP members to
forward downtown appointment forms and/or other documentation of care to the
AFRC/ANG medical unit’s PRP Office, SGP or CO/unit monitor.

       C4.4.3.5. (Added)(AFGSC) For documentation received directly from outside
sources (e.g., consult notes from the Referral Management Office) the MTF will:

          C4.4.3.5.1. (Added)(AFGSC) Review the documentation and the member’s
medical records, if necessary, to determine whether or not a CMA was previously
consulted regarding the non-military medical or dental care. This review will be done by
trained and designated personnel.
Change 1, 11/10/2009                          58                                   CHAPTER 4
           C4.4.3.5.2. (Added)(AFGSC) If the off-base care was already addressed by a
CMA, the documentation will be forwarded for final review in accordance with paragraph
C4.4.2.7, and the results of the CMA review will be filed with the non-military medical or
dental care documentation in the medical record.

           C4.4.3.5.3. (Added)(AFGSC) If there is no documentation suggesting the non-
military medical or dental care was already referred or addressed by a CMA, the
documentation will be forwarded to a CMA for review. The CMA will determine if there is
any PDI and will make the appropriate notification IAW paragraph C4.4.3, if necessary.
The CMA or designated representative will notify the unit that the member received care
outside the MTF without prior consultation from the MTF and has not yet seen a CMA for
medical evaluation.

       C4.4.3.6. (Added)(AFGSC) When a PRP member receives a written prescription
from an non-military medical or dental care or non-CMA provider but is unable to fill it at
the on-base pharmacy (e.g., holidays, after hours, out of town), the member must ensure
that his/her unit has been notified as soon as possible that he/she has sought care outside
the PRP clinic and has been treated with a medication. He/she must also discuss this
medical care and medication with a CMA provider prior to returning to PRP duty. If the
prescription can be filled at the MTF pharmacy, the following should occur:

         C4.4.3.6.1. (Added)(AFGSC) The member will bring the written prescription to
the PRP Clinic for CMA Review.

          C4.4.3.6.2. (Added)(AFGSC) The CMA will review the medication and make
appropriate notification recommendations (if any required).

           C4.4.3.6.3. (Added)(AFGSC) For any medication prescription, if the member
intends to fill/start the medication on a future date, he/she is responsible for notifying the
CMA of the projected start date for the medication so that the CMA can make the
appropriate PRP recommendation.

            C4.4.3.6.4. (Added)(AFGSC) The PRP clinic will develop local procedures to
indicate to pharmacy personnel that a PRP disposition has been made. For example: the
CMA could stamp the back of the prescription with his/her signature block, sign/initial and
date it, indicating to pharmacy personnel that a PRP disposition has been made.
Alternately, the CMA may provide member with “notification slip” to take to the
pharmacy along with the prescription.

               C4.4.3.6.4.1. (Added)(AFGSC) If a member attempts to fill a medication
after the date it was prescribed or stamped by a CMA, the MTF pharmacy will not fill the
prescription without additional confirmation from the CMA and/or PRP Clinic. This is to
ensure that the member is recommended for the appropriate length of suspension based on
the medication start date.



Change 1, 11/10/2009                           59                                  CHAPTER 4
           C4.4.3.6.5. (Added)(AFGSC) PRP-certified AFRC/ANG members or civilian
contract employees not eligible to fill prescriptions at the MTF pharmacy will have to fill
all prescriptions at an off-base pharmacy, and must report any change in medical
treatment (including new medications) as soon as possible to their CO and CMA.

   C4.4.4. Because of the danger to public health and safety or to U.S. national security that
might result from the failure of an individual performing PRP duties to perform reliably,
mandatory substance abuse testing of all military, civilian, and contractor personnel assigned to
PRP duties shall be conducted according to DoD Directives 1010.1 and 1010.9 (References (kr)
and (ls)).

        *C4.4.4.1. (Added)(AF) Random drug urinalysis testing for military individuals will be
accomplished in accordance with AFI 44-120 (Reference [w]). Drug abuse testing for military
and civilian personnel assigned to specially designated Nuclear Command and Control PRP
positions identified in Table AP1.T1. (subsequent to 25 May 93) shall be administered
before the individuals assume those duties. The AF Civilian Drug Testing Plan specifies that
all Air Force civilian PRP positions are “Testing Designated Positions,” and as such, PRP
employees are subject to random testing. These positions must be formally identified and
designated on each position description and vacancy announcement. Drug testing for
contractor personnel will be in accordance with the contract and will be equivalent to the AF
Civilian Drug Testing Plan.

    C4.4.5. Hypnosis shall not be administered to individuals certified under the PRP without
the knowledge of the individual’s certifying official. The certifying official shall evaluate the
underlying reason for seeking hypnosis and the potential impact on performance, reliability, or
safety while performing PRP duties. When screening an individual for PRP duties who has been
administered hypnosis, the CMA shall determine if there was an underlying medical reason for
the individual to seek hypnosis.

    C4.4.6. (Added)(AF) A PRP contract employee will consult with their contract CMA
for all health-related issues.

     C4.4.7. (Added)(AF) A FDA-approved OTC medication and US commercially available
substance, to include nutritional supplement, may be used by PRP personnel without CMA
approval, provided the product is used in accordance with US manufacturers’ directions for
its intended use. The use of herbal medications and any supplements should be discussed
with the CMA prior to use to determine intended use or underlying condition. NOTE:
Aircrew members must consult AFI 48-123 (Reference [x]) for approved medication listing.

      C4.4.7.1. (Added)(AF) PRP personnel are required to consult with the CMA
whenever:

           C4.4.7.1.1. (Added)(AF) The member is within 12 hours of reporting to PRP
duties and will be using the product for the first time; or

            C4.4.7.1.2. (Added)(AF) The member has questions about a product’s use or
potential side effects; or

            C4.4.7.1.3. (Added)(AF) The member experiences adverse reactions, which may
affect the member’s ability to perform duties.

   *C4.4.8. (Added)(AF) Operational use of Go/No-Go pills for aircrew is authorized in
accordance with the Air Force Go/No-Go pill policy guidance.


C4.5. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS

Actions taken shall depend on the nature of the allegations and the sensitivity of the individual’s
PRP duties. After careful review of all the information, the certifying official may suspend,
decertify, or allow the individual under investigation to continue in PRP duties. In making that
determination, nuclear surety shall be the primary consideration and shall not be compromised to
aid an investigation. Regardless of the status of the investigation, when nuclear surety is
determined to be in jeopardy, the certifying official shall immediately remove the individual
from the PRP.

C4.6. CONTRACTOR PRP CONTINUING EVALUATION
Contractor employees who have been determined eligible by the contract monitor and have been
assigned to PRP positions shall be annotated in the DoD designated personnel security
information system of record or identified to DISCO DSS, P.O. Box 2499 2780 Airport Drive,
Suite 400, Columbus, Ohio 43216-5006 43219-2268. On receipt of any information that may
affect the reliability and trustworthiness of a contractor employee under the PRP, DISCO DSS shall
forward that information to the appropriate certifying official.

    *C4.6.1. (Added)(AF) Provide a list of all contract employees to AF/A10-O, HQ USAF/A10-
O, 1307 Brookley Ave, Suite 201, Bolling AFB, Washington, DC 20032.




Change 1, 11/10/2009                            61                                    CHAPTER 4
                                               C5. CHAPTER 5

                       DISQUALIFICATION, REMOVAL, AND REINSTATEMENT

C5.1. POTENTIALLY DISQUALIFYING OR DECERTIFYING CRITERIA

Any of the following traits or conduct may be grounds for disqualification or decertification of
individuals from the PRP. In evaluating such traits or conduct, certifying and reviewing officials shall
ensure there is no reasonable doubt of an individual’s reliability and that it is in the best interest of national
security that the individual be assigned to duties involving nuclear weapons. If potential clearance eligibility
impact is determined, the information will be provided to the appropriate CAF or for contractor employees,
to DSS.

     C5.1.1. Alcohol. Any alcohol-related incident, alcohol abuse, or alcohol dependency (see DL.4,
DL.5, and DL.6) may be grounds for removal or disqualification from PRP duties. The certifying official,
after consultation with the CMA, shall determine the degree to which an alcohol problem impacts the
reliability of the individual being considered for PRP assignment.

         C5.1.1.1. Alcohol-Related Incident. Individuals involved in an alcohol-related incident shall be,
at a minimum, suspended from PRP duties. The certifying official shall conduct an investigation of the
circumstances and request a medical evaluation. If the individual is not returned to PRP duties within 120
days, temporary or permanent decertification actions shall be taken, as appropriate. Individuals prescribed an
alcohol awareness/training class may be returned to PRP duties prior to completion of the class when the
certifying official determines the individual to be reliable based on the results of an investigation and medical
evaluation.

         C5.1.1.2. Alcohol Abuse. Individuals diagnosed as alcohol abusers, but who are not diagnosed
as alcohol dependent, shall, at a minimum, be temporarily decertified. Those individuals may have their
temporary decertification removed and be returned to PRP duties after successfully completing a prescribed
rehabilitation program or treatment regimen, when they have displayed positive changes in job reliability
and lifestyle, and receive a favorable medical prognosis by the CMA. Failure to satisfactorily meet these
requirements shall result in permanent decertification.

         *C5.1.1.3. Alcohol Dependency. Individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent shall be disqualified or
decertified from the PRP. (Added)(AF) An individual initially diagnosed as alcohol dependent while on
PRP will be immediately temporarily decertified pending treatment outcomes. An individual who fails
or refuses treatment for alcohol dependency will be permanently decertified.

             C5.1.1.3.1. Individuals temporarily decertified for alcohol dependency may have their
temporary decertification removed and be returned to PRP duties after successfully completing
rehabilitation, and a minimum of 180 days of a formal aftercare program according to DoD Instruction
1010.6 (Reference (mt)). A PRP qualification screening, to include a favorable prognosis by the CMA, shall
be completed before rescreening or recertification.

           C5.1.1.3.2. Failure to satisfactorily complete a formal aftercare program or other
alcohol-related misconduct shall result in permanent decertification or disqualification.

             C5.1.1.3.3. Any individual who voluntarily consumes alcohol after being diagnosed
as alcohol dependent shall, at a minimum, be suspended from PRP duties. The certifying
official, after consultation with the CMA, shall determine the degree to which the alcohol

Change 1, 11/10/2009                                   62                                          CHAPTER 5
consumption impacts the reliability of the individual being considered for PRP assignment. If
the individual is not returned to PRP duties within 120 days, temporary or permanent
decertification actions shall be taken, as appropriate.

            C5.1.1.3.4. (Added)(AFGSC) MTF PRP Clinics will maintain a list of all PRP-
certified individuals returned to duty or certified with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.
They will obtain this information from ADAPT quarterly at which time they will conduct a
supplemental review. This review will go back to the date of the diagnosis or last
supplemental review to ensure that for each alcohol dependent PRP member, the CO was
notified of any subsequent admission of alcohol use.

        C5.1.1.4. Pre-Service (Alcohol-Related Incidents). Involvement in pre-service alcohol-
related incidents, to include underage alcohol use which resulted in legal action, does not
automatically render an individual ineligible for consideration for, or retention in, a PRP
position. It is incumbent on the certifying official to determine the degree to which the alcohol
related incidents impact the reliability of the individual being considered for PRP duties.

    C5.1.2. Drugs. Drug abuse or drug dependency (see DL.21, DL.22.) is grounds for
disqualification or decertification. A drug-related incident (see DL.23) is grounds for removal
from PRP duties. The certifying official, after consultation with the CMA, shall determine the
degree to which drug use impacts the reliability of the individual being considered for PRP
assignment.

         C5.1.2.1. Drug-Related Incident. Individuals involved in a drug-related incident shall
be, at a minimum, suspended from PRP duties. Suspension under these circumstances shall only
be used when reliability is not in question. The certifying official shall conduct an investigation
of the circumstances and request medical evaluation. If the certifying official has any reason to
doubt or suspect the individual’s reliability for PRP duties the following actions will be taken:

            C5.1.2.1.1. The individual concerned shall immediately be temporarily decertified.

          C5.1.2.1.2. A complete evaluation shall be conducted of the individual’s drug
involvement and current and past duty performance.

             C5.1.2.1.3. A PRP qualification re-screening including a complete medical evaluation
shall be started.

            C5.1.2.1.4. Removal of the temporary decertification and recertification into the PRP
shall require thorough justification and documentation for recommendation for retention in PRP
duties, a determination that recertification is in the best interest of the service and national
security, and statements by the reviewing and certifying official that the individual’s reliability is
not in doubt. (Added)(AF) Document the recertification using the AF Form 286.

            C5.1.2.1.5. Individuals determined to be ineligible for recertification to PRP duties shall
be permanently decertified, and that action shall be made a matter of permanent record, where
applicable, such that the person cannot move to another location/unit and seek PRP certification.

Change 1, 11/10/2009                              63                                      CHAPTER 5
            C5.1.2.1.6. Any individual found to have been involved in the unauthorized
trafficking, cultivating, processing, manufacturing, or sale of any controlled or illegal drug, to
include cannabis-based products, shall be ineligible for PRP duties.

           C5.1.2.1.7. Any individual found to have ever used a drug that could cause
flashbacks (hallucinogens such as LSD, mescaline, etc.) is ineligible for PRP duties. In addition,
any individual who has ever used peyote is ineligible for PRP duties, including those individuals
otherwise protected under Public Law 103-344 (42 U.S.C. section 1996a) of title 42,U.S.C.
(Reference (nu)).

            C5.1.2.1.8. It is not the intent of this Regulation to automatically disqualify or
decertify any individual from PRP who, in an effort to self-medicate, inadvertently or deliberately
exceeds the recommended safe dosage on the medication’s packaging of over-the-counter
substances or who improperly uses prescribed medications. If the certifying official suspects or
the individual admits to such improper usage, the individual must be suspended from PRP duties
and the CMA consulted. If a CMA diagnosis of drug abuse is rendered, the certifying official
shall permanently decertify the individual.

        C5.1.2.2. Drug Abuse. Any individual diagnosed as a drug abuser will not be certified
into the PRP or, if certified, will be permanently decertified, and those actions will be made a
matter of permanent record such that the person cannot be transferred to another location/unit
and become PRP certified.

        C5.1.2.3. Drug Dependency. Any individual diagnosed as drug dependent will not be
certified into the PRP or, if certified, will be permanently decertified, and those actions will be
made a matter of permanent record such that the person cannot be transferred to another
location/unit and become PRP certified.

        C5.1.2.4. Pre-Service Drug Use. Pre-service use of marijuana, hashish, or other cannabis-
based product does not necessarily render an individual ineligible for consideration for, or
retention in, a PRP position. It is incumbent on the certifying official, with CMA consultation, to
determine the degree that the pre-service drug use impacts the reliability of the individual being
considered.

             C5.1.2.4.1. It is not the intention of this Regulation to render automatically ineligible
for the PRP all individuals who are or have been in the program after disclosing pre-Service or
in-Service cannabis use and who, before May 25, 1993, were certified according to the PRP
certification rules of their Service DoD Component that were in effect at the time of their first
certification in which this use was considered during the PRP certification process. Further, if
individuals were certified at a time when the Services did not require disclosure of cannabis use,
and they subsequently made such disclosure, this disclosure will not be the sole reason for
decertification.

             C5.1.2.4.2. If the pre-Service cannabis use is discovered after an individual is already
certified, and there is no other information that would cause doubt about the individual’s reliability,
the certifying official, with CMA consultation, may retain the individual in the PRP.


Change 1, 11/10/2009                              64                                     CHAPTER 5
    C5.1.3. Other Substances. Use of any other substances that alter perceptions or mental
faculties including sniffing glue or aerosol fumes, shall be handled as drug incidents, abuse or
dependence, respectively, as determined after consultation with the CMA.

    C5.1.4. Negligence or Delinquency in Performance of Duty. If the certifying official’s review
of the PRP candidate’s or certified member’s job or duty history reveals a lack of dependability,
flexibility, good attitude or good judgment, the member should not be certified, or should be
decertified. In determining reliability, the certifying official must evaluate all aspects of an
individual’s actions.

    C5.1.5. Conviction of, or Involvement in, a Serious Incident. Conviction by a military or
civil court of a serious offense, including both felonies and misdemeanors, or involvement in a
serious incident, or a pattern of behavior or conduct that is reasonably indicative of a
contemptuous attitude toward the law or other duly constituted authority.

     C5.1.6. Medical Condition. Any significant physical or mental condition substantiated by
the CMA to be prejudicial to reliable performance of the duties of a particular critical or
controlled position. The certifying official shall take the necessary actions to ensure that the
individual is properly screened both medically and psychologically. Individuals who experience
personal trauma, including but not limited to such events as family illness/death, violent crime,
to include sexual assault or accidental injury, may experience psychological symptoms that impact
reliability. When individuals affected by personal trauma seek medical care, the CMA will
assess potential impact upon reliability, and advise the CO accordingly. The CMA is not required to
disclose the personal circumstances that resulted in trauma, but are required to inform the CO of
the specific medical/psychological diagnosis and treatment that may potentially impact
reliability. As with all potentially disqualifying medical conditions, the certifying official must
decide each case on the specific medical and other pertinent evaluations of the individual
involved. The primary consideration in all determinations must be in the best interest of national
security.

    C5.1.7. Poor Attitude or Lack of Motivation. Poor attitude or lack of motivation as evidenced
by aberrant attitude or irrational behavior, inappropriate behavior or mood may be grounds for
decertification.

     C5.1.8. Suicide Attempt and/or Threats. Any suicide attempt and/or threat may be grounds
for disqualification or decertification. In determining reliability, the certifying official must evaluate
all aspects of the individual’s action. Any suspected attempt and/or threat of suicide will result in
the individual’s temporary decertification from PRP duties pending the results of a mental health
assessment/evaluation.

    C5.1.9. Loss of Confidence. If for any reason the certifying official loses trust or confidence
in a member’s ability to perform PRP duties, the certifying official shall decertify the member.

C5.2. SUSPENSION

Suspension is used to immediately remove a member from PRP duties without starting
decertification action. When suspended, a member is still considered reliable for the PRP, but
Change 1, 11/10/2009                                65                                      CHAPTER 5
because of the circumstances, is not authorized to perform PRP duties. Although a
recommendation to suspend an individual from PRP duties may come from many sources, the
certifying official must evaluate the situation and determine whether suspension is appropriate.

    C5.2.1. Suspension shall be used only when the individual’s reliability is not in question,
when the problem is expected to be of short duration, and while conducting an investigation or
medical evaluation to determine if a situation or incident could have an adverse effect on an
individual’s reliability.

    C5.2.2. A suspension requires that the certifying official remove the individual from duties
requiring PRP certification, notify the individual and his or her supervisor of the nature and
circumstances about the suspension. A suspension will initially be for up to 30 days. However,
the certifying official may extend the period of suspension up to 120 days in 30-day increments,
when there is insufficient information to either remove the suspension or return the individual to
PRP duties or to either temporarily or permanently decertify the member. If the issue cannot be
resolved, or if the cause of the suspension lasts longer than 120 days, the individual shall be
temporarily decertified until the issue is resolved and the individual is either returned to PRP
duties or permanently decertified. (Added)(AF) Notify entry control authorities of all
suspensions.

    C5.2.3. (Added)(AF) Documentation. Use the AF Form 164 or locally devised system to
track and remove the suspension as soon as the CO makes a determination. (Added)(AFGSC)
The unit will track all suspension 30 day extensions from the CO.

    *C5.2.4. (Added)(AF) A CO who is suspended may perform PRP administrative
functions (e.g., qualification/certification, suspension, temp decertification and permanent
disqualification/decertification actions).

   C5.2.5. (Added)(AFGSC) The MTF will assume all suspension/temporary
decertification recommendations to the CO were followed unless otherwise indicated by the
CO or appointed monitor. The CO or unit monitor will report all non-concurrence by the
CO to the PRP clinic either by email or phone message.

C5.3. DECERTIFICATION

Any individual who fails to meet the reliability standards specified in this Regulation shall not be
assigned to, or continued in, duties of a PRP position. PRP certification shall be revoked
immediately on a certifying official’s determination that an individual no longer meets the
standards in this Regulation. The certification shall terminate administratively when an
individual transfers from a PRP position to one not requiring certification. There are two types:
(Added)(AF) For certifications that shall terminate administratively refer to paragraph
C4.4.2.4.1.1.

   C5.3.1. Temporary Decertification

        *C5.3.1.1. Temporary decertification from PRP duties shall occur immediately on
receipt of information that is, or appears to be, a reason for decertification from the PRP. That
Change 1, 11/10/2009                             66                                    CHAPTER 5
action shall be taken when the certifying official has information that could be expected to affect
an individual’s job performance or reliability and suspension is not appropriate. Temporary
decertification shall not be used if the facts dictate permanent decertification. When temporarily
decertified, the individual may not perform PRP duties. Within 15 workdays of the temporary
decertification, the certifying official shall provide the individual in writing the reason(s) for
temporary decertification unless the individual is returned earlier to PRP duties. Individuals
temporarily decertified will remain under continuous evaluation for PRP purposes until permanently
decertified or returned to PRP duties. (Added)(AF) Remove individual’s access and notify
entry control authorities.

         C5.3.1.1.1. (Added)(AF) Any of the following four conditions shall result in
temporary decertification:

                C5.3.1.1.1.1. (Added)(AF) Diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or dependent; or

                C5.3.1.1.1.2. (Added)(AF) Establishment of a Security Information File; or

                C5.3.1.1.1.3. (Added)(AF) Withdrawn access to classified information; or

                C5.3.1.1.1.4. (Added)(AF) Suspended security clearance eligibility in JPAS
that reflects “action pending” by the AFCAF, or a revocation or denial of eligibility by the
Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office for contractor personnel.

       C5.3.1.2. The certifying official shall investigate all information essential to a decision
about revoking the temporary decertification or invoking a permanent decertification. During
suspected alcohol or drug abuse, the investigation shall include a medical evaluation by the
CMA.

        *C5.3.1.3. Temporary decertification shall not normally exceed 270 days. However, the
certifying official may extend the period of temporary decertification in 30-day increments to a
maximum of 365 days. Extensions shall be documented. (Added)(AF) Document extensions
using the AF Form 164 or a locally devised system to track and remove as soon as the CO
makes a determination. Ensure temporary decertification is resolved or the individual is
permanently decertified prior to military reassignment, separation, discharge processing,
or reassignment /termination of employment for contractor personnel. If individual is
permanently decertified ensure this reason is stated in the remarks of the AF Form 286A.

    *C5.3.2. Permanent Decertification. Individuals who the certifying official determines to no
longer meet the reliability standards specified in this Regulation shall be permanently decertified.
Within 15 workdays of the determination, the certifying official shall advise the individual, in
writing, of the reasons for decertification and of the requirement for review by the reviewing official.
(Added)(AF) This includes Permanent Disqualification. Document the Permanent
Decertification/Disqualifications using the AF Form 286A.

         C5.3.2.1. Any of the following four conditions shall result in permanent decertification
or, if an individual is being considered for a PRP position, permanent disqualification:
(Added)(AF) Any of the following eight conditions:
Change 1, 11/10/2009                              67                                     CHAPTER 5
            C5.3.2.1.1. An individual who is diagnosed as alcohol dependent and subsequently fails
the required aftercare program.

           C5.3.2.1.2. An individual who is diagnosed as a drug abuser.

           C5.3.2.1.3. An individual who is diagnosed as drug dependent.

           C5.3.2.1.4. An individual’s security clearance is revoked.

           C5.3.2.1.5. (Added)(AF) An individual involuntarily discharged, removed for
cause, or whose employment was terminated and the CO lost trust and confidence in that
individual’s ability to perform PRP duties. Documentation will be completed prior to
discharge, removal or termination.

           C5.3.2.1.6. (Added)(AF) Use of drugs listed in para C5.1.2.1.7.

            C5.3.2.1.7. (Added)(AF) An individual found to have been involved in drug
trafficking, cultivating, processing, manufacturing or sale of a controlled or illegal drug
(Reference para C5.1.2.1.6.).

            C5.3.2.1.8. (Added)(AF) A military individual who is reassigned, separated, or
discharged, or a contractor who is reassigned/terminated, prior to temporary
decertification resolution.

        C5.3.2.2. To ensure uniform application of the reliability standards specified by this
Regulation and effective use of personnel, consistent with the purpose of the PRP, a reviewing
official shall review each case involving a permanent decertification decision. The reviewing
official may seek additional information or explanations of extenuating circumstances from the
certifying official, the CMA, personnel officials, and the individual concerned, if appropriate.
(Added)(AF) This also applies to permanent disqualifications decisions.

         C5.3.2.3. Following the review of the permanent decertification action, the reviewing
official shall notify the individual and the certifying official of the findings and conclusion
within 15 workdays. In the case of a DoD contractor employee, the contractor shall be told only
that the employee has been decertified and must be reassigned to non-PRP duties in compliance
with contractual requirements. (Added)(AF) This also applies to permanent disqualification
actions.

        *C5.3.2.4. If the reviewing official approves the permanent decertification, the individual
shall be removed from positions requiring PRP certification and the action shall be made a matter
of permanent record. (Added)(AF) This also includes permanent disqualification. Document the
permanent disqualification/decertification using the AF Form 286A. Forward the AF
Form 286A to AFPC PRP processing utilizing CMS. Maintain an electronic copy on file until
the original is verified and filed in the individual’s automated record. If the RO disapproves
the permanent disqualification/decertification, the case file and AF Form 286A are destroyed.
Update PDS with the applicable PRP status code (date RO signed AF Form 286A).
Change 1, 11/10/2009                            68                                   CHAPTER 5
C5.4. REINSTATEMENT/REQUALIFICATION

     C5.4.1. A certifying official or reviewing official may request reinstatement of a member’s
PRP certification or requalification consideration for members who were permanently
decertified/disqualified provided the reason or condition of the permanent decertification or
ineligibility no longer exists. Approval authority for reinstatement is Head of a DoD
Component. Each Head of a DoD Component shall determine delegation authority within their
Component. Requests for reinstatement or requalification must be in writing, contain
justification and information as determined by Service directives. If reinstatement or
requalification is approved, initial qualification/screening shall be completed as described earlier
in this Regulation.

    C5.4.2. Individuals permanently disqualified or decertified for alcohol dependency may be
reinstated/requalified for PRP duties under the following conditions:

       C5.4.2.1. The individual has successfully completed an initial intensive rehabilitation,
according to Reference (mt).

       C5.4.2.2. The individual has completed a 1-year period of strict compliance with aftercare
program requirements according to Reference (mt).

       C5.4.2.3. In all cases a PRP qualification screening including a favorable prognosis by
the CMA and a psychological evaluation shall be completed before requesting reinstatement.
(Added)(AF) PRP qualification screening will include a psychological evaluation by a
psychiatrist, psychologist or social worker.

         C5.4.2.4. The responsible certifying official must determine that the value of the
member’s continued presence in the PRP outweighs the risk from potential future alcohol-related
incidents and must document the fact that he or she has full trust and confidence in the member’s
reliability.

    C5.4.3. (Added)(AF) Forward requests to reinstate PRP eligibility to AF/A10-O for
approval (reference C2.1.). The request will include the chain of command recommendations
(including CMA, and any specialist consultations if health-related, CO, RO, MAJCOM
SGP if health related, and MAJCOM PRP) and all documentation that substantiated the
permanent decertification or disqualification, and documentation that support the opinion
that the condition or reason no longer exists. NOTE: Ensure request cases are in
compliance with Privacy Act and HIPAA policies.

C5.5. (Added)(AF) APPEAL

    C5.5.1. (Added)(AF) An individual may appeal a PRP permanent disqualification/
decertification if improperly or unjustly processed (reference C2.1.). Individuals must
provide a written request for an appeal, with rationale and supporting evidence. Forward

                                         PRP POSITIONS

AP1.1. GENERAL

The reliability standards established in Chapter 3 shall be used to determine an individual’s
eligibility for a PRP position. All PRP positions shall be formally designated as either critical or
controlled and shall be restricted to the minimum number required to accomplish the mission. Only
certified personnel shall be assigned to designated PRP positions and when PRP positions become
vacant, certified personnel shall be assigned as rapidly as possible. Examples of typical PRP
positions are shown in Table AP1.T1., below.

AP1.2. REVIEW OF PRP POSITIONS

Certifying officials shall re-evaluate designated PRP positions annually to determine the need for
additional positions or the cancellation of unnecessary positions.

    *AP1.2.1. (Added)(AF) MANPOWER POSITION CODING. The following manpower
designators shall be used when identifying PRP coded manpower billets:

   A - CRITICAL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRP
   D - CONTROL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRP

   I - CONTROL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRP (NUCLEAR EXPERIENCE REQ)
   N - CRITICAL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRP (NUCLEAR EXPERIENCE REQ)

    AP1.2.2. (Added)(AF) ADDITIONAL DUTY. In some cases, the CO may be required
to certify personnel for PRP additional duty. Certify those selected for PRP additional
duty according to this Regulation and Supplement, but do not document these requirements on
the Unit Manning Document.

    AP1.2.3. (Added)(AF) CONTRACTOR PRP POSITIONS. Because of the diversity of
position titles and duties in the Air Force, the reliability standards established in this
instruction will be used to determine which positions will be identified for PRP. The Cos
formally designate PRP positions as either “critical” or “controlled” and keep positions to the
minimum required to accomplish the mission. This requirement will be met during contract
establishment.

   AP1.2.4. (Added)(AF) CONVERTING POSITIONS. Prior to converting military or
DoD civilian PRP coded positions to civilian contractor positions, the functions to be
converted must be deemed required and essential by AF/A10. This determination must be
made and approval granted, in writing, prior to nominating the function for contract
performance.

     AP1.3. PRP POSITION ELIGIBILITY

     Eligibility for assignment to PRP positions, subject to the reliability standards in Chapter 3, shall
     be confirmed in writing by a certifying official. Before an individual is assigned to PRP duties,
     it shall be certified that the individual has had the required PSI and clearance, been screened
     according to the reliability standards, been personally interviewed by the certifying official, and
     been found eligible and qualified for assignment to a PRP position. (Added)(AF) Certification
     shall be documented using the AF Form 286.
