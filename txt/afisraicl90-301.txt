     1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRLs) are the primary lists
     used during the AFISRA/IG UCI to assess unit compliance with established guidance
     governing each particular area of operation. Items in this C&SRL are defined by the AFISRA
     staff and based upon existing “by-law” requirements, Executive Orders, DoD directives, AF
     and AFISRA guidance, and mission areas deemed critical by AF and AFISRA leadership to
     assess and assure unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective of the
     C&SRLs is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
     1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCOs) represent the highest priority of inspection
     items and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCAs)
     and the 13 mission areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower-tier
     Core and General Compliance Items may be stand-alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the
     UCI, it is the intent of the AFISRA/IG to inspect 100% of the CCOs that apply to the
     inspected unit. However, the C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the inspection.
     Critical, core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
        1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). An area or item where unit failure to
        comply with established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or
        serious injury or significant mission impact. CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL
        CAPS FORMAT. Key mission areas are:
            1.2.1.1. Airman development programs.
            1.2.1.2. Ability to deploy forces.
            1.2.1.3. Ability to employ forces.
        1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance
        and is important to the overall performance of the unit, but not deemed "Critical."
        Noncompliance would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could
        result in injury or possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
        1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to the
        successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal
        impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible
        litigation. GCIs are shown in sentence case format.
