1. Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS):
     1.1. A MSDS must be immediately accessible (in either paper or electronic format) for every
     item on the work area/shop-specific hazardous chemical inventory.
     1.2. Environmental Branch HazMat Cell, 88 ABW/CEANP, Building 30022, 257-3389 or
     257-7152, maintains a master MSDS file containing most hazardous materials used at
     WPAFB. AFRL maintains master MSDS files at the following locations: AFRL/RX,
     Building 20653, AFRL/RY, Building 20620, and AFRL/RZ, Building 20490.
     1.3. MSDSs in the workplace will be provided as follows: all workers on all shifts must
     know how to obtain a MSDS, and have unrestricted direct access to MSDSs for     their
     work area/shop during all shifts.
     1.4. MSDS access: MSDSs may be maintained in the work area/shops in paper or electronic
     version. If the primary means for MSDS access is electronic, a back-up system for MSDS
     access must be established in case primary computer access is disrupted.  The back-up
     system may include, but is not limited to, paper copies, local computer files or CDs at
     another non-impacted location.
     1.5. Workers with questions or those who desire clarification, concerning MSDS
     information should contact Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) to establish a time, during
     the worker’s shift, for review of the MSDS. BE will review the MSDS with the employee
     and provide an explanation of MSDS information. Emergency requests after normal duty
     hours can be directed to the BE Technician on call at 313-9662.
     1.6. Process all new HAZMAT request through the HAZMAT Cell according to the
     Installation HAZMAT Management Program Plan.
2. Labels and Other Forms of Warning:
     2.1. Labeling of hazardous chemical containers will be done according to 29 CFR
     1910.1200(f), and DoDI 6050.5-H, DoD Hazardous Chemical Warning Labeling System.
     2.2. It is the responsibility of chemical manufacturers, importers and commercial distributors
     to label containers of hazardous chemicals according to the Federal HAZCOM standard
     (HCS). Accordingly, chemical containers entering the installation through the supply system
     or through local purchase should already be labeled according to the HCS.
     2.3. Materials exempted from HAZCOM labeling requirements are in AFI 90-821,
     paragraph 2.6.3. Read 29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(5) if additional details are desired.
     2.4. Supervisors will ensure labels on containers of hazardous chemicals used in their work
     area/shop meet HCS requirements, remain affixed to their containers, and are not obliterated
     or covered. If supervisors need additional labels, they must call the manufacturer of the
     product and have them sent via email, fax, or traditional mail. At a minimum,            the
     following information will appear on container labels:
        2.4.1. The identity of the hazardous chemical(s) in the container.
        2.4.2. Appropriate hazard warnings which include information about the specific
        physical and health hazard(s), including target organ effects, of the chemical(s) in the
        container. This may be accomplished using any combination of words, symbols, or
        pictures.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI90-821 7 MARCH 2012                                                         3


      2.4.3. Each HAZMAT must have a Hazardous Materials Management System (HMMS)
      yellow barcode label which contains the product MSDS #, container serial # and product
      name.
   2.5. Although immediate use containers are exempt from HAZCOM requirements, all
   containers containing HAZMAT on WPAFB will be properly labeled. If HAZMATs are
   transferred to a smaller container for immediate use, it must be labeled with the product name
   and the MSDS #.
3. Employee Information and Training:
   3.1. Supervisors will ensure Public Health (PH), BE, base safety, and fire department review
   and approve the work area/shop specific hazard training program for technical accuracy and
   completeness prior to implementation in the work area/shop.
   3.2. Hazard Communication Training. The work area/shop supervisor is responsible for
   ensuring all workers are properly trained on the chemical hazards in their work area/shop.
   Both initial and supplemental training will be documented on AF Form 55, Employee Safety
   and Health Record.
      3.2.1. Supervisor Training. Supervisors of work areas will be trained by PH, 88
      AMDS/SGPM, 255-2515, prior to training workers.
      3.2.2. Initial Training. Workers will receive comprehensive HAZCOM training from
      their supervisors at the time of their initial assignment in a work area/shop.
      3.2.3. Supplemental Training. Training for all potentially affected employees is required
      when either a new hazard is brought into the work area/shop or a new chemical is
      introduced. Supervisors may use BE special survey letters as sources of information to
      meet this training requirement. When workers change work area/shops either by
      assigned duties or location, work area/shop specific training will be re-accomplished
      only to the extent needed to cover changes in working conditions and potential exposures.
4. Hazardous Chemical Inventory:
   4.1. Work area supervisors develop a hazardous chemical inventory as part of the HAZCOM
   binder. BE assessors will review this inventory during the industrial shop  assessment.
   4.2. The HAZCOM folder/binder is maintained in the work area and updated by supervisors
   as necessary. When new chemicals are introduced into and/or removed from the work area,
   the supervisor will ensure chemicals are added or deleted from the chemical inventory within
   15 business days. Each supervisor is responsible for ensuring the HAZCOM folder/binder
   is updated and readily available to each worker.
   4.3. As a minimum, the inventory will include the MSDS # and the chemical’s identity
       that is used on the MSDS for each hazardous chemical used in the work area.
5. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials:
   5.1. Non-routine tasks are those tasks included within a work area/shop’s normal activities
   but performed infrequently (usually less often than monthly), for example, cleaning a solvent
   tank and changing the solvent. These tasks may also include temporary duties outside an
   individual's normal Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) or job series.
 4                                       WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI90-821 7 MARCH 2012


     5.2. Supervisors will ensure work area Operating Instructions (OI), specific task lists,
         and Job Safety Analyses (JSA) thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards,
     and controls, for the infrequent tasks. If applicable, the OI must also include procedures for
     working with unlabeled pipes. OIs do not need to be prepared if technical orders (TO) or
     other official documents adequately describe these tasks and associated hazards and controls.
     Supervisors will ensure workers review these procedures before performing the non-routine
     tasks.
6. Determining the Hazard of a Chemical:
     6.1. The Air Force will rely on the hazard determination of the supplier or manufacturer of
     purchased chemicals. For Air Force-produced chemicals, the Air Force activity controlling
     the formulation will make the hazard determination and produce an MSDS, IAW 29 CFR
     910.1200, for BE to review and approve. The Air Force activity producing the chemical will
     include hazard determination procedures in their written program and ensure their personnel
     are trained on the hazards. If the chemical is transferred to any other organizations, the
     producing organization will provide a MSDS with the shipment and transmit a copy IAW
     AFI 90-821.
7. Contractors in AF Work Area/Shop(s):
     7.1. When an Air Force work area/shop uses hazardous chemicals in a way that contractor
     employees (e.g., a painting contractor working in an industrial shop) may be exposed, then
     the work area/shop written hazard communication program and access to MSDSs must be
     provided to the contractors in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1 200(e)(2). The contractor is
     responsible to determine the adequacy of the HAZCOM information for assessments of
     contractor employees, and is responsible for their own HAZCOM program.
8. Work area/shop HAZCOM binders will utilize the following format:
     8.1. Tab A. HAZCOM Trainer Certification.
     8.2. Tab B. AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication.
     8.3. Tab C. WPAFBI 90-821, WPAFB Written Hazard Communication Program.
     8.4. Tab D. Work Area/Shop Specific Hazard Communication Training Plan.
     8.5. Tab E. Non-Routine Task Listing (or statement of no non-routine tasks).
     8.6. Tab F. Bioenvironmental Engineering Survey Reports.
     8.7. Tab G. Chemical Inventory.
     8.8. Tab H. Additional Information (i.e. Public Health requirements and supervisor’s quality
     control checklists).
