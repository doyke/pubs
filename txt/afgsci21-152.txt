OVERVIEW This is the initial publication of AFGSCI 21-152. This instruction establishes
policies and procedures to be followed by applicable AFGSC units.


1. Purpose.
     1.1. The Engine Trending & Diagnostic (ET&D) program is intended to further the safe
     operation, performance reliability, and lower maintenance operating costs of installed gas
     turbine engines. The program analyzes trends in all available engine parameters to detect the
     onset of engine internal failures and shifts in instrumentation calibration or accuracy. When
     properly administered, this is an effective management tool that allows maintenance
     personnel to take corrective actions before an engine failure or expensive secondary damage
     occurs.
2. AFGSC/A4V Responsibilities.
     2.1. AFGSC/A4VA is designated as the AFGSC office of primary responsibility (OPR) for
     this program. The OPR will:
        2.1.1. Participate in major ET&D conferences, meetings, and committees to identify and
        discuss relevant ET&D issues and policies.
        2.1.2. Identify specific requirements to assist the ET&D programs through all available
        technology channels and processes.
        2.1.3. Ensure units operating ET&D programs have sufficient manning positions and
        appoint qualified, experienced persons as ET&D Project Managers at each operating
        base. Identify this position with an SEI code of 604(B-2) or 612(B-52) on the UMD.
        2.1.4. Ensure owning units submit accurate and timely quality deficiency reports to the
        applicable engine program offices on all equipment requiring any maintenance activity
        due to an ET&D recommendation and on all ET&D component failures where no ET&D
        maintenance recommendation was made.
        2.1.5. Ensure that each unit provides timely and accurate metrics to the Central Engine
        Management System/Central Engine Trending and Diagnostic System (CEMS
        IV/CETADS) database.
        2.1.6. Ensure that all applicable programming documents (budget, facilities, manpower,
        maintenance, etc.) include the need for ET&D support.
        2.1.7. Coordinate all proposed changes to this publication with appropriate AFGSC staff.
        2.1.8. Coordinate between AFMC and the other MAJCOMs on matters concerning
        ET&D.
