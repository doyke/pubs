This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-150,
Management of Cyberspace Support Activities. This supplement describes AETC’s procedures for
use in conjunction with basic AFI. This supplement applies to all AETC organizations and functions
that manage or perform organizational or intermediate-level maintenance on communications-
electronics (C-E) systems, equipment, and circuits, to include field operating agencies, AETC-gained
Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units, and AETC Air National Guard (ANG) units. This
publication may not be supplemented. No waivers will be granted for any part of this publication.
Changes to the procedures in this publication are not authorized without approval of HQ
AETC/A6OC. After approval by the appropriate group commander (or squadron commander, if not
assigned to a group), send recommendations for change or comments to this supplement using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to HQ AETC/A6OC, 61 Main Circle, Ste 2,
Randolph AFB TX 78150-4545. Similarly, send recommended changes or comments to the basic
AFI through HQ AETC/A6OC for forwarding to SAF/A6ONI. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. See Attachment 1 for a glossary of
references and supporting information.

2.9.14. (Added) Waivers concerning Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS)
equipment or infrastructure will be submitted to HQ AETC/A6OC for review and action.This
includes any waivers that have implications to equipment configuration.
      2.9.15. (Added) Ensure units manage auxiliary power and uninterruptible power supply
      (UPS) systems supporting C-E equipment in the same manner as other communications
      systems. When maintenance requirements are not within the capability of the
      communications unit or other wing organizations, establish a service contract or other
      means to ensure both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance requirements are met.
      2.9.16. (Added) Appoint in writing a grounding and lightning protection monitor for
      each base communications maintenance flight. This monitor will verify that all required
      documentation is available in accordance with AFI 32-1065, Grounding Systems, when
      grounding and lightning protection systems are checked. All documentation will be
      posted in the respective facility historical data file and the monitor will ensure required
      intervals for checks are maintained."
      2.11.13. (Added) Prepare and maintain a master preventive maintenance inspection
      (PMI) schedule for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment whose technical,
      commercial, or user's manual suggests or mandates preventative maintenance routines.
      2.11.14. (Added) Unit ATCALS maintenance Communications Focal Point (CFP)
      function must notify HQ AETC within 1 hour of a “RED” outage start time. A “RED”
      outage is defined as ATCALS or weather equipment unusable or unable to perform the
      assigned mission. This notification will be via the Web-based ATCALS tracker located
      at https://www-r.aetc.af.mil/sc/atcals/Atcals.asp.       If the Web or Web link is
      unavailable, units should e-mail HQ AETC/A6OC (aetca6ocall@us.af.mil) or telephone
      HQ AETC/A6OC. Table 2.1 (Added) identifies systems that require outage reporting.
      Any commissioned mobile or tactical system providing (on an interim basis) the same
      capability as the systems listed in Table 2.1 (Added) also require outage reporting.
      2.11.15. (Added) ATCALS Tracker reports will include the mission impact as
      determined by the user, operator, or flying community point of contact (for example,
      tower chief, RAPCON chief). Mission impact is considered “MINIMAL” if there is little
      to no effect on the flying mission, “SIGNIFICANT” if the flying mission is impacted (for
      example, lost sorties or training), or “CRITICAL” if the flying mission cannot be
      performed (for example, airfield is closed) as determined by the operator or user IN
      TERMS OF THE EQUIPMENT OUTAGE.
      NOTE: If the mission impact is determined to be SIGNIFICANT or CRITICAL and the
      outage is 4 hours or longer, higher headquarters reporting IAW AFI 10-206 is required.
      This reporting does not replace reporting under the Equipment Status Reporting (ESR)
      Subsystem of the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS).
      2.11.16. (Added) Units will update HQ AETC/A6OC within 1 hour of a status change
      (according to the process outlined in paragraph 2.11.14 (Added) when new information
      becomes available or when a system, equipment, or supply status changes, to include an
      outage closure and a fix action.

      2.11.17. (Added) For ATCALS facility reference data collection in accordance with
      T.O. 00-33A-1001, all facility parameters will remain at established reference values,
      plus or minus applicable tolerances in equipment technical orders. If any reference
      values change as a result of maintenance actions, parts replacement, and/or flight
      inspection, the work center NCOIC will:
         2.11.17.1. (Added) Ensure a complete data collection is performed within 24 hours.
         This includes all data required on current reference/PMI data forms for respective
         equipment.
         2.11.17.2. (Added) Any changes made to data will be plainly marked with an
         asterisk to all affected values and a complete explanation of why the reference data
         was changed will be entered into the remarks block of the reference/PMI data form
         2.11.17.3. (Added) A copy of the new reference data AND a copy of the old
         reference data will be submitted to HQ AETC/A6OC for review and approval. ALL
         REFERENCE DATA WILL BE APPROVED IN WRITING BY HQ AETC/A6OC.
         ANY REFERENCE DATA THAT IS NOT APPROVED IS INVALID.
         2.11.17.4. (Added) When new reference data is approved by HQ AETC/A6OC,
         copies will be returned to the work center and IMMEDIATELY filed in the
         respective section of the facility data folder. This will include a copy of the
         correspondence provided by HQ AETC/A6OC specifying that the new reference data
         is approved.
         2.11.17.5. (Added) Superseded data should be retained in the work center
         equipment historical file for at least 2 years for trend analysis.

NOTE: This requirement does not apply to any new equipment remotely maintained by the
Regional Maintenance Center (RMC) under the ATCALS Modernization program.
      2.12.11. Any SLAs, MOAs, MOUs concerning ATCALS and/or weather equipment in
      any way will be forwarded to the ATCALS CFP function and the ATCALS work center
      for review and action.
      2.12.16. (Added) The unit Communications Focal Point (CFP) will report ANY AND
      ALL equipment malfunctions and/or failures of the base GIANT VOICE system in the
      ATCALS TRACKER (see Table 2.1, item 11 and paragraph 2.11.14). THE GIANT
      VOICE SYSTEM DOES NOT NEED TO BE COMPLETELY INOPERATIVE FOR A
      REPORT TO BE GENERATED; A REPORT IS REQUIRED FOR ANY FAILURE.
      The report will include the details of the malfunction/failure and the total cost of the
      repair.
