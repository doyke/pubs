SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 51-507, Ground Accident Investigations

Releasability: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.

By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this is an Air Force Guidance Memorandum (AFGM)
immediately implementing new procedures and processes that shall be used for ground accident
investigations. Compliance with this AFGM is mandatory. In accordance with Air Force
Instruction (AFI) 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, to the extent the directions of
this AFGM are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails.
Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this AFGM are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

In advance of a new AFI 51-507, this AFGM provides direction that is effective immediately for
all ground accident investigation boards (GAIBs) designated as high-interest. High-interest
GAIBs are mishaps in which there is a loss of life, serious personal injuries, significant civilian
property damage, or accidents that are likely to generate widespread media or congressional
interest in accordance with AFI 51-507, paragraph 7.5.1. Convening authorities have discretion
to designate as high-interest GAIBs those that do not otherwise meet the definition under the
instruction. This memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from the date of this
memorandum or upon publication of an interim change or rewrite of the affected publication,
whichever is earlier.

        1. The Air Force Legal Operations Agency, Claims and Tort Litigation Division,
Aviation and Admiralty Law Branch (AALB) shall assist the convening authority’s staff judge
advocate (SJA) in reviewing high-interest accident reports. This review will be accomplished
before the report is submitted to the convening authority for approval and will occur in two
stages.

                 a. Either the GAIB president or the convening authority, at his or her discretion,
may request an informal quality review. The informal review is conducted while the GAIB is
still in place. The goal of the review is to quickly assess whether the report is clear,
understandable, and accurate and to identify any major deficiencies in the investigation or
analysis in time for the GAIB president to make changes or continue the investigation should he
or she wish to do so.

                b. The formal quality review is part of the convening authority’s SJA’s formal
staffing of the completed report immediately prior to approval by the convening authority.
During the formal review the convening authority’s SJA analyzes format and content of the
narrative portion and tabbed material, checking all citations for accuracy and ensuring no
nonreleasable or inappropriate information is included in the report.

        2. Informal Quality Review. The GAIB president may initiate the informal quality
review process by submitting at a minimum, a draft of the Summary of Facts, Statement of
Opinion (if required), and Executive Summary to the convening authority’s SJA. The convening
authority’s SJA may request additional material at his or her discretion.

               a. The convening authority’s SJA, at his or her discretion, may forward the draft
documents to the AALB for assistance with the informal review. Some factors to consider
include the complexity of the report, the experience of the convening authority’s legal staff, the
existence of extensive public or congressional interest, and the probability of litigation.

               b. If the convening authority’s SJA elects to forward the draft documents to the
AALB, the AALB will review them and provide comments back to the convening authority’s
SJA within two duty days of receipt. The convening authority’s SJA is under no obligation to
accept or forward any AALB comments to the AIB president.

               c. Regardless of whether the the AALB assists with the informal review, the
convening authority’s SJA must independently review the draft documents and provide his or her
own comments to the GAIB president normally within three duty days of his or her receipt or
one duty day from his or her receipt of any comments from the AALB, whichever occurs later.

       3. Formal Staffing Quality Review. The GAIB president initiates the approval process
by sending the completed GAIB report to the convening authority’s SJA.

                 a. The convening authority’s SJA provides the GAIB report to the appropriate
staff offices, as determined by the convening authority, and to the AALB for review and
comment.

               b. The staff offices will review the GAIB report and provide their comments
back to the convening authority’s SJA within the time established by the convening authority’s
SJA. The AALB will provide its comments back to the convening authority’s SJA within five
duty days of receipt of the complete report. Any delay beyond this time period will be
communicated to the convening authority’s SJA. The AALB’s comments will be primarily
concerned with the narrative language, advising whether it is logical and supportable on its face,
with due regard for the interests of the next of kin.

               c. The convening authority’s SJA must independently review the GAIB report
and provide his or her own comments, along with the comments received from the AALB and
staff offices, back to the GAIB President. No comment should be attributed to any particular
individual, but will identify the originating organization or office (e.g., AALB, A3/5, JA).

                d. The GAIB president must consider the comments in finalizing the GAIB
report. Based upon the comments received, the GAIB president may elect to continue the
investigation, accept a comment or comments and modify the GAIB report accordingly, or not
accept a comment or comments and make no changes to the GAIB report.

               e. The review and approval process should be completed in 30 days when
possible. Once the convening authority approves the report, his or her SJA provides the
approved GAIB report, the convening authority’s action, and the approved Public Affairs release
plan to the AALB. Within two duty days of receipt of these documents, the AALB will prepare
and deliver a high-interest package to the office of The Judge Advocate General (AF/JA).

        4. Undue Influence. Change AFI 51-503, paragraph 10.2 to read: “Undue Influence. It
is imperative the GAIB president and other board members not be subjected to undue influence
by anyone in a position of authority, to include the convening authority, his or her staff, or any
individual or organization superior to the board president or board members. Undue influence
might be manifested by an attempt to direct the GAIB president to reach a specific opinion or
conclusion or to mandate changes to the GAIB report. However, the prohibition against undue
influence does not prohibit a convening authority from communicating directly with the GAIB
president or other board members, receiving periodic updates of the board’s progress, requesting
consideration of new evidence, or presenting for the GAIB president’s consideration alternative
opinions and hypotheses interpreting the evidence. The convening authority’s SJA may
communicate directly or indirectly with the GAIB president concerning the content of the GAIB
report, including arranging ‘operator-to-operator’ or ‘expert-to-expert’ discussions when
necessary to resolve concerns raised during the review.”

        5. Length of Investigation. Although the ground accident investigation should be
completed and ready for formal staff review within 30 days, there are many factors in high-
interest ground accident investigations that may cause a delay. Some of these factors include
difficulty reaching the mishap site due to location or weather, lack of evidence, delays in
obtaining key witness interviews, or the need for additional experts. Completing the report as
soon as possible is important in high-interest mishaps because of demands from the next of kin
and the media for releasable information; however, the overriding concern is producing a
thorough, complete, and high-quality report that is in substantial compliance with this guidance
memorandum and the instruction. The GAIB shall communicate with the convening authority’s
SJA if the length of the investigation needs to be extended.

        6. Scheduling NoK and/or Seriously Injured Personnel Briefings. No one shall contact
the next of kin and/or seriously injured personnel to schedule a briefing until the AALB informs
the convening authority’s SJA it is permissible to do so. This will normally occur two duty days
after AF/JA receives the complete high-interest package from the AALB, unless AF/JA elects to
forward the high-interest package to the offices of the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of
Staff of the Air Force for review, in which case a briefing normally cannot be scheduled until
four duty days after the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force receive
the report; however, circumstances may expand this four-day period.
       7. Delegations. The convening authority’s SJA may delegate his or her duties and
responsibilities included in this AFGM.

This Instruction implements guidance from DoD Instruction 6055.07, Accident Investigation,
Reporting, and Record Keeping, and AFPD 51-5, Military Legal Affairs, and complements AFI
91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFPD 91-2, Safety Programs.

This Instruction explains when and how to conduct a legal investigation of accidents occurring
on land or a body of water that result in death, permanent total disability, or significant property
damage. It provides guidance and procedures for conducting required ground accident
investigations, including afloat mishaps. It describes how to prepare and distribute accident
investigation reports. It also tells how to store and dispose of relevant physical evidence,
documents, and other materials. This Instruction addresses release of accident information and
interactions with the Next-of-Kin (NoK), Congress, media, and other interested parties. It
prohibits unauthorized disclosure of accident investigation information by personnel subject to
this Instruction.

This Instruction applies to all military and civilian personnel in the United States Air Force, Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG). Failure to observe the
prohibitions and mandatory provisions specified in paragraph 7.1.2 of this Instruction by active
duty Air Force members, AFRC members on active duty or inactive duty for training, and ANG
members in federal service, is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ). Failure to observe the same prohibitions and mandatory provisions by a civilian
employee may result in administrative disciplinary action.

This Instruction only applies to the following categories of DoD accidents, as the categories are
defined in DoD Instruction 6055.07, Accident Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping, and
AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports: explosives and chemical agents, directed energy,
 2                                                                                                       AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


afloat, motor vehicle, ground, industrial, and aircraft accidents where there was no intent for
flight. This Instruction applies to mishaps that occur during training events if the accidents
otherwise constitute mishaps to which this Instruction applies. This Instruction does not apply to
DoD accidents involving aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles where there is intent for flight, or
to other investigations covered by AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations, which
specifies the requirements for conducting legal investigations of accidents involving such assets.
In addition, this Instruction does not apply to off-duty military mishaps or to accidents involving
the administration of professional services, such as medical care and legal assistance.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This change
eliminates the requirement for commanders to convene a Ground Accident Investigation Board
following mishaps that result solely in damage to government property (paragraph 1.3.1.3);
clarifies when a GAIB is required (para. 1.3); clarifies when a GAIB is discretionary (para. 1.4);
further explains those circumstances when a GAIB is not required (paragraph 1.6); adds
paragraph 2.5.2 requiring convening authority to fund TDY travel of all GAIB members; reduces
the time to complete the investigation from 45 days to 30 days (para. 4.4.4); removes the Media
section of the GAIB report (figure 8.2); adds paragraph requiring technical order release
authority be included in the Tabs section of the GAIB report (para. 8.3.3.3.1); modifies the
guidance for including names of personnel in the completed GAIB report (para. 8.3.7); changes
the standard of proof for substantially contributing factors to preponderance of evidence (para.
8.6.5.2); and changes the report format to allow using a three-ring binder (para. 8.8.1).

                                            Chapter 1

                 GROUND ACCIDENT AND SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS

1.1. Purpose. In compliance with DoDI 6055.07, Accident Investigation, Reporting, and
Record Keeping, this Instruction provides guidance for conducting Ground Accident
Investigation Boards (GAIB). GAIBs are legal investigations convened to inquire into the facts
surrounding ground or afloat accidents, prepare a publicly releasable report, gather and preserve
all available evidence for use in litigation, claims, disciplinary actions, administrative
proceedings, and for other purposes.
1.2. Scope. This Instruction may be used as guidance for conducting legal investigations not
otherwise required under this Instruction. In such cases, the report of investigation or other
written report of the inquiry will not reference this Instruction as authority for the investigation.
EXCEPTION: A Convening Authority described in paragraph 2.1 of this Instruction may
convene a GAIB citing this Instruction as authority for a legal investigation of any incident not
covered by AFI 51-503.
1.3. When GAIBs are Required. Except as provided in paragraph 1.6 of this Instruction, a
GAIB must be convened for on-duty, Class A accidents involving: aircraft ground operations
where there is no intent for flight; motor vehicle, ground or industrial mishaps, including those
related to fire, combat training, or the workplace environment; radioactive materials; explosives;
chemical agents; or a directed energy weapon, device, or equipment.
   1.3.1. A Class A accident is one resulting in at least one of the following:
       1.3.1.1. A fatality or permanent total disability, as defined in DoDI 6055.07.
       1.3.1.2. The destruction of an Air Force aircraft. An aircraft that is non-repairable is a
       destroyed aircraft; however, an aircraft that is damaged but will not be repaired is not
       automatically a destroyed aircraft.
       1.3.1.3. The total mishap cost is $2,000,000 or more to either government property,
       private property, or both. A GAIB is not required for mishaps causing damage solely to
       government property and not involving destruction of an aircraft; however, some type of
       legal investigation may still be required as described in paragraph 1.4 of this Instruction.
           1.3.1.3.1. See DoDI 6055.07, Enclosure 2 and AFI 91-204, Chapter 1 and
           Attachment 1 for more information about mishap categories and classes. Mishap
           costs are calculated using the guidance provided in AFI 91-204. Calculate total
           mishap cost in accordance with guidance specified in DoDI 6055.07, Enclosure 4;
           AFI 91-204; and AFMAN 91-221.
   1.3.2. For purposes of this Instruction only, DoD Personnel are on-duty when:
       1.3.2.1. Physically present at any location where they are to perform their officially
       assigned work. Officially assigned work includes organization-sponsored events an
       employee is permitted to attend, regardless of location.
       1.3.2.2. Being transported by DoD or commercial conveyance to perform officially
       assigned work. This includes travel in private motor vehicles or commercial
 8                                                                         AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


        conveyances while performing official duty but does not include routine travel to and
        from work or employee travel during a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) move.
        1.3.2.3. On Temporary Duty (TDY). TDY personnel are on-duty 24-hours a day for any
        injury that results from activities essential or incidental to the TDY assignment.
        However, when personnel deviate from the normal incidents of the trip and become
        involved in activities, personal or otherwise, that are not reasonably incidental to the
        duties of the TDY assignment, the person ceases to be considered on-duty for purposes of
        this Instruction.
1.4. Discretionary GAIBs
     1.4.1. DoDI 6055.07 may mandate the legal investigation of a ground or afloat mishap for
     which a GAIB is not required as specified in paragraph 1.3 of this Instruction. However, a
     GAIB is discretionary in such cases. Conduct either a GAIB or another type of legal
     investigation (as described in paragraph 1.5 of this Instruction) for the following mishap
     categories requiring a legal investigation pursuant to DoDI 6055.07:
        1.4.1.1. Mishaps likely to generate a large amount of public, media, or Congressional
        interest.
        1.4.1.2. Mishaps from which litigation for or against the Government or a Government
        contractor is anticipated.
        1.4.1.3. Mishaps from which disciplinary or adverse administrative action against an
        individual is anticipated.
1.5. Legal Investigation Alternatives
     1.5.1. For ground or afloat mishaps where a GAIB is not required as specified in paragraph
     1.3 of this Instruction, other investigative formats are available to satisfy the DoDI 6055.07
     legal investigation requirement. For other accidents requiring a legal investigation (i.e.,
     Class B, C, D, or other lesser mishaps as defined by DoDI 6055.07), commanders should
     consider the following:
        1.5.1.1. Security Forces or Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)
        investigations.
        1.5.1.2. Commander-Directed Investigations.
        1.5.1.3. Reports of Survey pursuant to AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force
        Property.
        1.5.1.4. Line of Duty determinations in accordance with AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty
        (Misconduct) Determinations.
1.6. Investigations Not Covered by This Instruction. Investigations of the following
accidents are not accomplished under this Instruction, except as directed by the MAJCOM
commander (as noted in paragraph 1.5 of this Instruction):
     1.6.1. Accidents for which legal investigations are conducted pursuant to AFI 51-503.
     1.6.2. Acts of vandalism, riots, civil disorders, sabotage, terrorist activities, or criminal acts,
     such as arson.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                           9


  1.6.3. Accidents investigated by a federal or appropriate state government agency that
  produces a publicly releasable report of the investigation.
  1.6.4. Accidents involving nuclear weapons, reactors, or radioactive materials involved in
  those systems.
  1.6.5. Accidents involving the administration of professional services, including (but not
  limited to) diagnosing medical conditions, prescribing medication, providing dental care,
  performing surgery, administering physical therapy, accomplishing mental health
  evaluations, conducting counseling, and providing legal assistance and advice.
  1.6.6. Suicides, homicides, intentionally self-inflicted injuries (e.g., Russian roulette), or
  death or injury resulting solely from illegal use of drugs or other substances.
  1.6.7. All suspected cases of friendly fire. DoDI 6055.07, at enclosures E2.1.16 and
  E4.6.3.5, requires a legal investigation report for all suspected cases of friendly fire. Such
  investigations are not GAIBs. The commander of the applicable Unified Combatant
  Command convenes friendly fire investigations, and the commander chooses the Service’s
  regulation that applies. Although this Instruction does not apply to friendly fire
  investigations, it may be used as a guide when conducting such investigations.
  1.6.8. Incidents of intentional or expected damage to Air Force vehicles, systems,
  equipment, or other property in the course of authorized activities (e.g., authorized testing or
  combat training, including missile and ordnance firing, and destruction of a weapon system
  to prevent capture by an enemy or hostile force).
  1.6.9. Incidents involving damage and/or injury that occur as the direct action of an enemy
  or hostile force.
  1.6.10. Mishaps that are not connected to the duties (i.e., the accident occurs outside the
  scope of employment) of the involved Air Force personnel.
  1.6.11. Replacement of component parts due to normal wear and tear, and when any
  associated damage is confined to the component part.
  1.6.12. Injuries associated with non-occupational diseases, when the disease, not the injury,
  is the proximate cause of a fatality, disability, or lost time (e.g., diabetes and its resultant
  complications).
  1.6.13. Injuries resulting from altercations, attack, or assault, unless incurred in relation to
  one’s official duties (i.e., within the scope of one’s federal employment).
  1.6.14. Injuries sustained before entry into military service or employment by the United
  States Government, unless specifically aggravated by current tenure of service.
  1.6.15. Injuries or fatalities to persons in the act of escaping from or eluding military or
  civilian custody or arrest.
  1.6.16. Death due to natural causes unrelated to the work environment.
  1.6.17. Normal residual damage as a result of a missile launch.
  1.6.18. Contractor accidents. DoDI 6055.07 defines a contractor accident as one involving
  injury or occupational illness to contractor personnel, or damage to contractor property or
  equipment.
 10                                                                    AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


1.7. Objective of Ground Accident Investigations and Safety Investigations. DoDI 6055.07
requires separate safety and legal investigations of accidents involving DoD personnel. Both the
legal and safety investigations serve a distinct purpose.
   1.7.1. The purpose of a legal investigation is to thoroughly inquire into the facts and
   circumstances surrounding accidents and prepare a publicly releasable report. The GAIB
   serves to obtain and preserve evidence for use in litigation, adjudication of tort claims,
   disciplinary actions, administrative actions, and for other purposes but does not focus on
   accident prevention.
   1.7.2. The military departments within DoD use different terminology to refer to legal
   investigations. The Army uses the term "collateral‖ investigation and the Navy uses the term
   "JAGMAN‖ investigation. In the Air Force, AFI 51-503 specifies the requirements for
   conducting Air Force legal investigations of accidents involving aircraft, missiles, and other
   aerospace assets.
   1.7.3. Safety investigations and reports are conducted and written solely to prevent future
   mishaps. In order to quickly obtain accurate accident information, safety investigators are
   sometimes authorized to grant promises of confidentiality in aviation mishaps. Statements
   obtained with a promise of confidentiality are privileged and not releasable to legal
   investigators or to the public. Safety Investigations into Ground Accidents are not authorized
   to grant promises of confidentiality. In addition, the evaluations, analysis, opinions,
   conclusions, recommendations, and other indicia of the deliberative process of the safety
   investigators are also generally privileged and not releasable to legal investigators or to the
   public. Non-privileged safety information acquired by the safety investigators will be made
   available to the legal investigation. Prior to the legal investigation, the non-privileged safety
   information will also be provided to the convening authority’s SJA upon request. Air Force
   safety investigations are carried out under AFI 91-204.
1.8. Investigation Boards and Reports.
   1.8.1. Unless the Air Force Safety Center (AFSC) waives the requirement, safety
   investigation boards (SIBs) produce formal, two-part reports of their investigations of Class
   A on-duty mishaps. Part I of the SIB report contains non-privileged factual information and
   is provided to the GAIB and, prior to a legal investigation, to the convening authority’s SJA
   upon request in order to determine whether an investigation is warranted. Part II contains
   confidential witness and contractor statements and documents, if any, as well as the SIB’s
   deliberations, findings, and recommendations. Part II of an SIB Report is privileged and is
   not released for use by the GAIB.
   1.8.2. The GAIB members assist the GAIB President in preparing a publicly releasable
   report of the facts and circumstances surrounding the mishap. The GAIB Report includes an
   Executive Summary, Summary of Facts, and only when specifically directed to by the
   convening authority, a Statement of Opinion on the cause, causes, and/or factors that
   substantially contributed to the accident. A Statement of Opinion is not normally required
   for GAIB Reports, except under extraordinary circumstances as described in paragraphs
   4.1.2.4.1 and 4.1.2.4.2 of this Instruction.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                        11


  1.8.3. The GAIB is a non-voting board, and the GAIB President is solely responsible for the
  contents of the GAIB Report. As permitted by and in compliance with the Privacy Act and
  Freedom of Information Act, GAIB Reports are:
     1.8.3.1. Provided and personally briefed, upon request, to individuals seriously injured in
     the accident (or their representatives) or to the Next-of-Kin (NoK) of persons who died
     because of the accident.
     1.8.3.2. Released to members of the public and media, upon request.
     1.8.3.3. Released to members of Congress, upon request.
     1.8.3.4. Released to other interested government agencies, upon request.
     1.8.3.5. Used by the Air Force for the adjudication of claims resulting from the accident.
     1.8.3.6. Used by Air Force commanders as a source document to assist them in assessing
     whether any punitive or adverse administrative action should be taken against persons
     whose negligence or misconduct contributed to the accident.
     1.8.3.7. Used for other purposes as necessary.
  1.8.4. The non-privileged Part I of the SIB report must be completed prior to the start of the
  GAIB; in rare cases AFLOA/JACC may grant exceptions. Ongoing safety investigations
  take precedence over ground accident investigations, and in the event of conflicts between
  the two investigations regarding access to the accident site, acquiring and examining
  evidence, and interviewing witnesses, safety investigations have priority. For this reason,
  and to facilitate the GAIB process, the two investigations should not overlap in time.
  1.8.5. When GAIBs are directed before or in lieu of SIBs, they will provide such factual
  information to the safety community, through the convening authority’s safety directorate, as
  necessary to ensure safe operations and proper safety information tracking. Such factual
  releases do not require prior coordination or approval.
     1.8.5.1. If there is no preceding SIB, a trained investigating officer (IO) not currently
     assigned to a full-time safety position may serve as a GAIB functional area expert (FAE)
     to assist in gathering factual, non-privileged evidence. In accordance with DoDI
     6055.07, Enclosure E4.6.2., personnel currently assigned to full-time safety positions will
     not be appointed a member or FAE of the GAIB. See paragraph 3.6.1 of this Instruction.

                                         Chapter 2

      CONVENING A GROUND ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION BOARD (GAIB)

2.1. Convening Authority.
   2.1.1. The MAJCOM commander of the organization that experienced the damage, fatality,
   or disability is responsible for convening the GAIB. AFI 91-204, Chapter 1 and Chapter 4
   provide guidance on accounting for losses and determining investigative responsibility for
   safety investigations.      The MAJCOM vice-commander may convene the accident
   investigation unless the MAJCOM commander withholds this authorization.
   2.1.2. When an accident involves assets or personnel from more than one MAJCOM, the
   involved MAJCOM commanders will determine which command is responsible for any
   required accident investigation. The commander who convened the SIB normally convenes
   any associated GAIB.
   2.1.3. When a mishap involves Air Force personnel or property and personnel or assets from
   another DoD Component, the same commander who would convene an SIB under AFI 91-
   204 convenes the GAIB. See AFI 91-204 for guidance on investigating mishaps involving
   multiple military services. Comply with DoDI 6055.07, Enclosure 4, paragraph E4.13 on
   investigations and reports of DoD Joint Service accidents.
2.2. GAIB Appointment.
   2.2.1. The Convening Authority initiates an accident investigation by convening a GAIB in
   writing.
      2.2.1.1. The convening order is issued to the GAIB President. See Attachment 2.
      2.2.1.2. The convening order will identify members appointed to the GAIB, and may
      also include any advisors or consultants the Convening Authority details to the Board.
      2.2.1.3. A supplemental appointment order will be issued if the Convening Authority
      adds additional members to the Board.
      2.2.1.4. A letter or other writing may be used to detail advisors or consultants to the
      Board after the convening order is issued.
      2.2.1.5. Foreign national board members and advisors may also be appointed in
      accordance with paragraphs 2.4.1, 3.1.9, 3.1.10, and 4.1.2.3 of this Instruction.
      2.2.1.6. The convening authority’s Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) may sign the convening
      order ―FOR THE COMMANDER‖ after the convening authority selects a board
      president unless the MAJCOM commander withholds this authorization.
   2.2.2. The Convening Authority’s Staff Judge Advocate may appoint, remove, or substitute
   GAIB members (other than the GAIB President), advisors, or consultants unless the
   MAJCOM commander withholds this authorization.
   2.2.3. For an accident investigation involving Air National Guard (ANG) or Air Reserve
   Component (ARC) personnel or property, the Convening Authority will, with the
   concurrence of the ANG or appropriate ARC, appoint an ANG or ARC member to the
   GAIB. Contact AFRC/JA or NGB/JA to coordinate the appointment.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                        13


   2.2.4. Members of the AFRC or ANG who meet the rank/grade and training requirements
   specified in Chapter 3 of this Instruction may serve in any capacity on a GAIB, to include
   serving as the GAIB President. When initiating the accident investigation, the appointment
   orders for each ARC member should cite 10 United States Code, Section 12301(d) (10
   U.S.C. § 12301(d)) as authority. Ensure GAIB duties do not create a conflict of interest with
   the ARC member’s civilian occupation or interests.
   2.2.5. Personnel from other DoD Components who meet the rank/grade and training
   requirements specified in Chapter 3 of this Instruction may serve in any capacity on an Air
   Force GAIB. However, personnel from other DoD Components normally will not serve as
   GAIB President. In addition, the rank/grade and training requirements of Chapter 3 do not
   apply (but should be followed) when appointing personnel from another DoD Component.
   The convening authority’s SJA will assist in coordinating appointment of GAIB Members
   from other DoD Components. AFI 91-204 provides guidance on investigating mishaps
   involving multiple military services.
2.3. Accidents Involving Air Reserve Component (ARC) Resources.
   2.3.1. The gaining MAJCOM commander convenes accident investigations initiated
   pursuant to this Instruction for accidents involving AFRC and/or ANG personnel and
   property. The gaining MAJCOM may delegate convening authority responsibilities to
   AFRC/CC or the NGB/CF; convening authority responsibilities may be delegated further
   consistent with paragraphs 2.1.1 and 2.2.2 of this Instruction.
   2.3.2. The AFRC/CC is the convening authority for investigations initiated pursuant to this
   Instruction when the accident involves AFRC resources (personnel and property) alone (i.e.,
   no regular Air Force personnel or resources are involved in the mishap). The NGB/CF is the
   convening authority for investigations initiated under this Instruction when the mishap only
   involves ANG personnel and resources. AFRC/CC and NGB/CF convening authority
   responsibilities may be delegated consistent with paragraphs 2.1.1 and 2.2.2 of this
   Instruction.
   2.3.3. For mishaps involving AFRC and ANG resources, but no Air Force resources,
   AFRC/CC and NGB/CF will jointly decide which component will investigate the accident.
2.4. Accidents in Foreign Territory and Accidents Involving Foreign Military Resources.
   2.4.1. Treaties, statutes, agreements, and/or other applicable authorities may affect the
   investigation of accidents that occur outside the United States involving Air Force personnel
   or assets. Similar authorities may affect the investigation of Air Force accidents involving
   personnel or property of foreign military forces. When an accident involving Air Force
   personnel or property occurs in a foreign territory or involves foreign military personnel or
   property, comply with this Instruction to the extent allowed by applicable treaties,
   agreements, and other applicable authorities. The requirement to conduct a GAIB and
   produce a GAIB Report in accordance with this Instruction remains unaffected by the
   location of the mishap or the degree of participation of a foreign country in the accident
   investigation.
   2.4.2. When a mishap occurs in an area outside the United States, consult the SJA of the
   MAJCOM or component responsible for air operations in that country or area of
 14                                                                   AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


   responsibility (AOR) for assistance in determining applicable constraints and additional
   requirements for conducting a ground accident investigation.
   2.4.3. When a mishap involving Air Force resources and foreign military personnel or
   property occurs in the United States, consult the SJA of the MAJCOM or component to
   which the Air Force resources are assigned for assistance in determining applicable
   constraints and additional requirements for conducting a ground accident investigation.
   2.4.4. Consult the servicing MAJCOM or component SJA for assistance in obtaining copies
   (and translations, if necessary) of reports written by foreign military or civilian authorities
   that investigate an accident involving Air Force resources (personnel or property).
2.5. Funding.
   2.5.1. The host installation funds all in-house support, even if the host installation is not
   assigned to the MAJCOM that convenes the GAIB (convening MAJCOM). ―In-house
   support‖ includes, but is not limited to: work areas and office work space; computers with
   Internet access; use of a computer printer, copy machine, and fax machine; paper supplies
   and computer CDs; telephone service; use of government owned or leased vehicles; and use
   of audio-visual equipment and services. See Attachment 4 of this Instruction for a listing of
   typical GAIB support requirements. In cases where the GAIB conducts the investigation at a
   host installation other than the installation where the mishap occurred, the convening
   MAJCOM is responsible for substantial incremental costs incurred by the GAIB.
      2.5.1.1. In cases in which the desired host installation is not assigned to the convening
      MAJCOM, concurrence of the convening authority should first be obtained. See Sample
      Memorandum to the Host Installation Commander (Attachment 3).
      2.5.1.2. If the host installation is not part of the convening MAJCOM, the host
      installation may seek reimbursement for GAIB expenses from the convening authority.
   2.5.2. The convening authority funds TDY travel costs of personnel appointed as Air Force
   GAIB members, advisors, and witnesses, including members from other MAJCOMs. Invited
   observers from other services, agencies, or governments, such as those described in
   paragraph 3.1.11 of this Instruction, should fund their own costs. For joint service boards,
   each military service funds its own personnel. See AFI 65-601, Volume I, Budget Guidance
   and Procedures, Chapters 7 and 10.
      2.5.2.1. TDY GAIB members shall be placed on full per diem for the duration of the
      GAIB. Dual billeting, variations authorized, and rental car shall be authorized.
   2.5.3. The convening MAJCOM funds leasing of vehicles or special equipment, leasing of
   communications, and other contractual services. The convening authority also funds costs
   associated with removal and storage of any wreckage, as well as any initial clean up of the
   accident site. However, the MAJCOM, ARC, or other DOD Component that owns, has
   operational control over, or is otherwise accountable for the vehicle, system, or other
   property determined by the Convening Authority to have caused the environmental damage
   at the accident site shall fund all costs associated with long-term accident site cleanup and
   environmental remediation unless the provisions of an applicable memorandum of agreement
   or intra-agency support agreement dictate otherwise.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                          15

                                          Chapter 4

                                   RESPONSIBILITIES

4.1. Convening Authority:
   4.1.1. Directs subordinate commanders or functional staff directors to nominate qualified
   personnel to serve on GAIBs.
   4.1.2. Convenes the investigation and issues the appointment orders to the GAIB President,
   using the format specified in Attachment 2 of this Instruction.
      4.1.2.1. At a minimum, the GAIB will consist of a GAIB President and a GAIB Legal
      Advisor.
      4.1.2.2. The convening authority may appoint subject matter experts to serve as GAIB
      Members or detail them to provide technical assistance to the board as GAIB Advisors.
      4.1.2.3. The convening authority should not appoint foreign military services
      representatives and foreign country representatives to serve as GAIB members or GAIB
      advisors and should not authorize foreign military services representatives and foreign
      country representatives to observe GAIB proceedings unless the representatives first
      agree in writing to comply with the provisions of this Instruction that prohibit disclosure
      of information about the GAIB’s work until after the convening authority has approved
      the GAIB Report. See Attachment 16 and paragraph 2.4.1 of this Instruction.
          4.1.2.3.1. The convening authority’s SJA prepares the letter or other document used
          to memorialize the agreement to comply with this Instruction.
          4.1.2.3.2. Consult HQ USAF/JAO if questions arise about the appropriate way to
          handle issues involving foreign military service representatives and foreign country
          representatives.
      4.1.2.4. The convening authority may require that the GAIB President prepare a
      Statement of Opinion about the cause, causes, and/or substantially contributing factors of
      the accident.
          4.1.2.4.1. Statements of Opinion should normally be required only in those rare
          circumstances in which the convening authority desires the Board President to
          provide for public record a personal conclusion of what caused the accident. If an
          SIB was conducted, such information would already have been provided to the
          convening authority and is privileged and confidential.
          4.1.2.4.2. Careful deliberation should precede the decision to require a Statement of
          Opinion, since the GAIB Report is publicly releasable and can be used against the
          United States in administrative and judicial proceedings (including tort claims and
          litigation). Although 10 U.S.C. § 2254(d) prohibits considering the opinions as to
          cause for aircraft accidents as evidence in civil or criminal proceedings or as an
          admission of liability by the United States, there is no statutory protection for
          opinions related to ground mishaps.
20                                                                    AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


  4.1.3. Designates the host installation and ensures the Host Installation Commander provides
  the support prescribed by this Instruction.
     4.1.3.1. The convening authority will send the commander of the Air Force installation
     nearest to the accident site a memorandum that identifies the installation as being
     responsible for providing administrative and logistic support for the accident
     investigation. Attachment 3 of this Instruction provides the format for the host
     installation designation letter.
     4.1.3.2. Whenever the nearest Air Force installation is attached to a different MAJCOM
     than the convening authority or is an ARC installation, the Convening Authority will
     coordinate designation as host installation with that command. In such cases, the letter
     designating the host installation should reflect the involvement of an appropriate higher
     level of command in making the designation.
  4.1.4. Provides funding for costs associated with conducting accident investigations IAW
  paragraph 2.5 of this Instruction.
  4.1.5. Ensures appropriate condolence letters are sent to the NoK IAW AFI 34-1101,
  Assistance to Survivors of Persons Killed in Air Force Aviation Mishaps and Other Incidents,
  AFI 36-809, Civilian Survivor Assistance, and AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services.
  4.1.6. Determines what factual information or documents concerning the accident will be
  released to the public prior to completion of the investigation, under the criteria contained in
  Chapter 7 of this Instruction.
  4.1.7. Approves the GAIB Report, using the format specified in Attachment 8 of this
  Instruction.   Approval indicates the GAIB Report meets statutory and regulatory
  requirements. Approval does not indicate whether the convening authority agrees or
  disagrees with the Statement of Opinion, if the convening authority requires a Statement of
  Opinion. See paragraphs 9.1 and 11.7 of this Instruction for guidance on approval of the
  GAIB Report.
  4.1.8. Approves the Notification and Release Plan created by the servicing Public Affairs
  Officer (PAO).
  4.1.9. Upon approval of the GAIB investigation, ensures that an appropriate official sends a
  letter to individuals who were seriously injured in the accident and to the NoK of military
  members and civilians who died because of the accident, advising them of the opportunity to

       GAIB Report may be releasable in full to the public, early release of information is
       limited.
       5.1.1.8. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. This implements
       AFPD 31-4, Information Security, and supplements DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security

       Combatant Command directives, or other sources of requirements or guidance identified
       by the convening authority or the convening authority’s SJA.
   5.1.2. The GAIB President:
       5.1.2.1. Contacts the convening authority’s SJA for a briefing on GAIB process and
       procedures.
       5.1.2.2. Contacts the GAIB Legal Advisor to discuss viewing the mishap site prior to
       removal of any wreckage and give instructions regarding notifying other GAIB Members
       about when and where to meet the GAIB President.
       5.1.2.3. Contacts the SIB President, if any, to:
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                          31


        5.1.2.3.1. Determine the status of search and rescue, recovery of remains, and
        salvage operations.
        5.1.2.3.2. Coordinate a visit to the mishap site prior to removal of any wreckage, if
        desired.
        5.1.2.3.3. Determine the status of the safety investigation in order to decide how to
        proceed with the GAIB. Although the SIB President may not discuss privileged
        safety information, the SIB President may relay the facts of the accident and describe
        the technical reports that will be in Part I of the SIB Report.
        5.1.2.3.4. Coordinate a face-to-face transfer of Part I of the SIB Report and all other
        non-privileged documents from the SIB to the GAIB. Ensure that the GAIB receives
        the original documents gathered by the SIB, even if the SIB provides an electronic
        copy of Part I of the SIB Report. The GAIB Legal Advisor should be present for a
        face-to-face transfer of the SIB Part I from the SIB to the GAIB. The GAIB
        President may also be present for the face-to-face transfer of the SIB Part I from the
        SIB to the GAIB.
            5.1.2.3.4.1. Before the GAIB President and GAIB members review the Part I and
            other SIB-provided evidence, the GAIB Legal Advisor must screen the evidence
            to ensure it does not contain privileged information. Documents containing
            privileged information should be returned to the SIB. The GAIB Legal Advisor
            should consult the convening authority’s SJA and AFSC/JA if questions arise.
            5.1.2.3.4.2. After the GAIB Legal Advisor finishes screening the Part I, the
            GAIB should review it to determine which, if any, additional tests should be
            conducted (e.g., metallurgy, hydraulics, simulator, forensics, control surfaces).
        5.1.2.3.5. Request a list of the names, duty titles, organizations, and phone numbers
        of SIB witnesses so the GAIB knows who the SIB interviewed about the accident.
        The list should indicate the role of each witness in the accident (e.g., driver, observer,
        responder, or NoK or family member of an individual involved in the accident).
        5.1.2.3.6. Request the SIB release witnesses.
        5.1.2.3.7. Coordinate transfer of wreckage and other evidence when no longer
        needed by the SIB. The transfer should be in writing from the SIB President to the
        GAIB President.
     5.1.2.4. Contacts the Incident Commander, if necessary, to:
        5.1.2.4.1. Determine the status of search and rescue, recovery of remains, and
        salvage operations.
        5.1.2.4.2. Coordinate a visit to the mishap site prior to removal of any wreckage, if
        desired or when directed by the convening authority.
        5.1.2.4.3. Coordinate transfer of wreckage and other evidence when safe to do so.
        The transfer should be in writing from the Incident Commander to the GAIB
        President.
     5.1.2.5. Contacts the Host Installation Commander or the Host Installation Liaison
     Officer to obtain work areas, equipment, administrative assistance, and other support.
 32                                                                    AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


      See Attachment 4 of this Instruction for a listing of typical support requirements for a
      GAIB.
          5.1.2.5.1. The work area should be private and as convenient as possible for both the
          GAIB and witnesses. Avoid using the installation courtroom since a judicial
          atmosphere may make witnesses uncomfortable.
   5.1.3. The GAIB members will proceed to the host installation or other locations as directed
   by the GAIB President. Temporary duty orders will be prepared locally. Orders should
   authorize 45 days of travel, authorize a rental car, provide for variations in travel to more
   than one location, and billeting at multiple locations at the same time. See paragraph 2.5 of
   this Instruction for guidance on funding issues. If the investigation requires travel outside the
   United States, GAIB members should consult their local military or civilian personnel flight
   before departing their home station for guidance about travel restrictions and requirements.
5.2. Collecting and Considering Evidence.
   5.2.1. After review by the GAIB Legal Advisor, GAIB members review the documents and
   other materials provided by the SIB and provide feedback to the GAIB President on
   information and records within their area of expertise.
   5.2.2. The GAIB gathers and reviews documents and other evidence related to the mishap.
      5.2.2.1. Relevant evidence may include, but is not limited to:
          5.2.2.1.1. Personnel, training, medical, driving, and criminal records.
              5.2.2.1.1.1. The medical member shall, IAW DoD 6025.18-R, DoD Health
              Information Privacy Regulation, paragraphs C7.1 and C7.11, obtain and review
              all relevant medical evidence, including medical records, autopsy protocols, X-
              rays, and toxicology reports from Air Force medical facilities. The medical
              member shall attempt to obtain such records from other non-Air Force medical
              facilities, IAW DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph C5.1. Because of privacy concerns,
              do not include these documents in the GAIB Report without first consulting the
              convening authority’s SJA. Generally, the GAIB Report should include medical
              record extracts or summaries only. Medical record summaries should be prepared
              by a GAIB member or GAIB advisor with specialized knowledge or training in
              medicine. The GAIB Legal Advisor should review and, if appropriate, comment
              on the summaries while they are in draft form.
          5.2.2.1.2. Diagrams, drawings, maps, and models.
          5.2.2.1.3. Leases, licenses, and credentials.

          materials.
          5.2.2.1.6. Documents that contain information that is not publicly releasable because
          of applicable restrictions under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a), the Arms Export
          Control Act (22 U.S.C. §§ 2751 to 2799aa), the Export Administration Act of 1979
          (50 U.S.C. App. §§ 2401-2420), or other legislation. See paragraph 8.3.3 of this
          Instruction for restrictions on inclusion of these documents in the GAIB Report.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                           33


          5.2.2.1.7. Contract documents, technical orders, design manuals, handbooks, and
          other sources of requirements or standards that are not authorized for public release
          without prior approval of the documents’ authors or custodians. See paragraph 8.3.3
          of this Instruction for restrictions on inclusion of these documents in the GAIB
          Report.
          5.2.2.1.8. Statutes, regulations, and government agency policy documents.
             5.2.2.1.8.1. The GAIB Members should consult with the office of primary
             responsibility for the relevant instructions, directives, policy guidance, and
             regulations to ensure that the references being used by the GAIB are current,
             accurate, and complete, and that the GAIB is correctly interpreting the references.
      5.2.2.2. Relevant evidence does not include privileged safety documents or privileged
      safety information.
      5.2.2.3. Relevant evidence may be owned and/or maintained by any person, office, or
      organization, to include government and non-government individuals and entities.
      Government entities may be federal, state, and/or local officials, offices, or organizations.
      5.2.2.4. Access to, use of, and publication of documents generated by individuals and
      agencies from a foreign country or other area outside the United States may require
      coordination with authorities of the foreign country or area. Consult with the convening
      authority’s SJA, the appropriate MAJCOM SJA, and/or HQ USAF/JAO for guidance and
      assistance with these documents.
   5.2.3. The GAIB will identify and interview witnesses, and document witness interviews,
   IAW Chapter 6 of this Instruction.
5.3. Writing the GAIB Report. The GAIB President will prepare and assemble the accident
investigation report IAW Chapter 8 of this Instruction.

   evidence, to include wreckage, obtained during its proceedings.
      5.4.1.1. GAIB members will not make redactions or add explanatory remarks to original
      documents. Instead, they will make alterations and redactions on photocopies and use
      only photocopies of the originals as working documents.
      5.4.1.2. The GAIB will retain original photographs, photograph negatives, videotape
      recordings, witness interview notes, and certified copies of original documents, records,
      or recordings and forward to the convening authority’s SJA upon completion of the
      accident investigation. Obtain certified copies IAW AFI 51-301, Chapter 8.
   5.4.2. Upon approval of the GAIB Report, the GAIB President will release, return, destroy,
   or forward GAIB evidence IAW Chapter 10 of this Instruction.
      5.4.2.1. Some documents (i.e., medical, dental, flying, training, and personnel records)
      are to be returned to their proper custodian after the GAIB Report is approved. Consult
      the convening authority’s SJA for guidance on which documents must be returned to
      their proper custodian and when to do so.
 34                                                                 AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


       5.4.2.2. Use transmittal letters to document the return of original documents to their
       proper custodians and forward a copy of the transmittal letters to the convening
       authority’s SJA with the Post-Investigation Memorandum required by paragraph 10.2 of
       this Instruction.
5.5. Accident Investigation Timetable.
   5.5.1. The GAIB, including completion of the GAIB Report, should be complete within 30
   calendar days from the GAIB President’s receipt of either the complete Part I of the SIB
   Report, or, if there is no Part I, all releasable portions of a SIB Report prepared for the
   mishap.
   5.5.2. If there is no safety investigation of the mishap, the GAIB should be complete within
   45 calendar days from the date of the GAIB appointment letter.
   5.5.3. The GAIB President may request additional time to complete the investigation
   through the convening authority’s SJA. When requesting additional time, the GAIB
   President will explain why an extension is needed and will specify a projected submission
   date for the GAIB Report.
   5.5.4. Figure 5.1 of this Instruction provides a suggested schedule for completing accident
   investigation tasks. Because accidents differ in nature and create varying challenges for
   accident investigators, the schedule is only a guide. The GAIB President should devise his or
   her own timetable for investigating the mishap and preparing the GAIB Report within the
   required time.

       include members of other military services, and ARC personnel.
       6.1.1.2. Assists in arranging interviews with members of foreign military services and
       foreign nationals.
   6.1.2. The GAIB President:
   6.1.2.1. Establishes a witness interview schedule to keep track of potential witnesses, and a
   timetable for conducting witness interviews. When developing the interview schedule, the
   GAIB President should consider the order in which to interview witnesses, or whether some
   key witnesses should be interviewed twice, once at the beginning of the investigation and
   later toward the end of the investigation. The interview schedule should be flexible to
   accommodate witness’ availability.
       6.1.2.2. Conducts all witness interviews.
       6.1.2.3. Ensures witnesses are advised of any documents or other items that should be
       brought to the interview. Such documents should be included in the GAIB Report as
       attachments to the witness’ testimony, statement, or interview summary.
       6.1.2.4. Authorizes GAIB members and advisors to attend witness interviews that will
       involve technical matters within their subject areas of expertise.
       6.1.2.5. May authorize other Board Members and Advisors to question the witness
       during the interview. Ensures that Board Members or Advisors who ask questions during
       the interview are identified on the audio recording each time they ask a question or make
       a comment on the record and their presence and participation is noted on witness
       interview transcripts or summaries.
   6.1.3. The Legal Advisor:
       6.1.3.1. Attends all interviews. Ensures the following witness interview procedures are
       conducted: each witness is advised of his/her rights and responsibilities regarding
       testimony provided to the GAIB and placed under oath or affirmation before testimony
       on the record. Provides the GAIB President legal advice as appropriate.
       6.1.3.2. Consults the Host Installation SJA for guidance before interviewing any federal
       civilian employees who may be covered by a bargaining unit.
           6.1.3.2.1. Federal civilian employees may be asked if they are represented by a
           certified bargaining unit but may not be asked if they are union members.
   6.1.4. The GAIB Members:
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                          39


      6.1.4.1. Attend interviews at the request of the GAIB President where technical or
      specialized matters will be discussed that are within their areas of expertise.
   6.1.4.2. When authorized by the GAIB President, question witnesses during interviews.
   6.1.5. The Host Installation SJA:
      6.1.5.1. Provides guidance upon request regarding interviewing local federal civilian
      employees who may be covered by a bargaining unit.
6.2. Interview Procedures.
   6.2.1. Air Force military members and civilian employees must cooperate with the GAIB, to
   include being interviewed as witnesses, unless they assert a legal right or privilege not to do
   so. DoD Contractor employees may also be required to cooperate, depending on the terms of
   the applicable contract. See paragraph 6.4 of this Instruction for guidance on witness rights
   and paragraph 6.4.4 of this Instruction for guidance on interviewing DoD Contractor
   employees.
      6.2.1.1. Prior to the formal witness interview introduction and before beginning the
      recording, ask the witness to provide the information outlined in Attachment 14 of this
      Instruction. Explain that gathering this personal information (name, address, Social
      Security Number, etc.) is authorized by the Privacy Act of 1974 and provide each witness
      with the Privacy Act Statement at Attachment 17 of this Instruction.
      6.2.1.2. Prior to the start of the recorded interview, witnesses should also be reminded to
      avoid guessing or speculation, or making specific disciplinary or corrective
      recommendations. If during the interview, an expert provides an opinion within his/her
      area of expertise, the interviewer should ask for the factual basis of his/her opinion.
      Expert opinions should be kept within the scope of the mishap and not address fleet-wide
      concerns or Air Force-wide practices.
   6.2.2. Interviews should be conducted in person. Interviews by telephone or video
   teleconference may be used when an in-person interview is impossible or impractical because
   the witness is deployed, on temporary duty assignment, or otherwise unavailable. For
   telephone interviews or video teleconference interviews, take appropriate steps to verify the
   identity of the witness.
      6.2.2.1. The GAIB President or Legal Advisor or any active duty officer or active duty
      senior non-commissioned officer shall administer the oath or affirmation to the witness
      on the record.
      6.2.2.2. Witnesses may not use their own recording devices to record their interviews.
      This protects from information being released prematurely to the public.
      6.2.2.3. Before beginning a telephone or video teleconference interview, inform the
      witness that the interview will be recorded. Do not record the interview without the
      witness’ consent. Ensure the consent is recorded.
      6.2.2.4. If the interview is conducted via video teleconference, it is not necessary to
      record the video portion of the interview. To enable the GAIB team to both view and
      hear a video teleconference interviewee, the interview may be conducted via live-feed
 40                                                                      AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


       video teleconference with only the audio portion recorded by the GAIB's recording
       device.
   6.2.3. The GAIB interviewer will begin all interviews with a witness introduction. The
   introduction, with appropriate modifications, will be:
―My name is [interviewer’s name]. [I am/We are] investigating the [type of accident] accident
that occurred on [date], [at/in/near location of accident]. This investigation, conducted under
AFI 51-507, is separate and apart from any safety investigation conducted under AFI 91-204.
This legal investigation is convened to inquire into the facts surrounding the accident, to prepare
a publicly releasable report, and to gather and preserve all available evidence for use in litigation,
claims, disciplinary actions, administrative proceedings, and for other purposes. [A safety
investigation was previously conducted concerning this accident. Any testimony you gave
before the safety investigation board will be kept confidential, if you were so advised, and can be
used only for accident prevention purposes. This board does not have access to any confidential
testimony you gave before the safety investigation board.] Your testimony to [me/us] may be
used for any proper purpose. Additionally, your testimony can be released to the public. Do you
understand the purpose of this accident investigation? [Do you understand the difference
between your testimony before the safety board and this accident board?] In compliance with
Privacy Act and the Air Force Privacy Act Program, you were given or shown a copy of the
Privacy Act Statement prior to the start of this interview.‖
   6.2.4. The GAIB interviewer will end each interview with the following questions, the
   answers to which may prompt the interviewer to ask additional questions, interview new
   witnesses, or consider evidence the Board might not have otherwise considered.
       6.2.4.1. Does the witness know of anyone else who might have information that the
       GAIB would find helpful in its investigation.
       6.2.4.2. Are there any documents, reports, or other evidence the Board might find helpful
       in its investigation.
       6.2.4.3. Is there anything that was not discussed during the interview that the witness
       thinks might be helpful to the accident investigation.
   6.2.5. The interviewer will advise the witness that he or she is subject to recall.
       6.2.5.1. The GAIB should expect to recall witnesses since testimony from other
       witnesses may prompt the Board to seek clarification of previous testimony. For this
       reason, the GAIB should consider retaining witnesses in the local area until they are no
       longer needed for further interviews.
   6.2.6. The interviewer will remind the witness of the official nature of the interview and
   direct the witness not to discuss his or her testimony with anyone without the GAIB
   President’s permission, or until the GAIB Report has been officially released to the public.
   6.2.7. The GAIB interviewer will comply with the rights advisement provisions of paragraph
   6.4 of this Instruction.
   6.2.8. DoD military members and civilian employees must testify under oath or affirmation.
   Other witnesses are not required to provide sworn or affirmed testimony, but the GAIB
   interviewer should attempt to question them under oath or affirmation.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                            41


      6.2.8.1. Before questioning a witness under oath or affirmation, one of the following
      declarations will be administered:
      6.2.8.1.1. For sworn testimony, ―Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are
      about to give in the matter now under investigation shall be the truth, the whole truth, and
      nothing but the truth, so help you God?‖
          6.2.8.1.2. For affirmed testimony, ―Do you solemnly affirm that the testimony you
          are about to give in the matter now under investigation shall be the truth, the whole
          truth, and nothing but the truth?‖
   6.2.9. The GAIB cannot grant promises of confidentiality to witnesses. The contents of all
   interviews are subject to public release except for classified information. See paragraph 8.3.4
   of this Instruction for restrictions on the release of classified information in the GAIB Report.
   6.2.10. Do not ask witnesses to speculate or guess, or to provide their opinions on the
   ultimate cause or causes of the accident. If experts provide opinions within their area of
   expertise, ask for the factual basis of their opinions.
   6.2.11. See Chapter 2 of AFI 90-301 and SAF/IGQ Inspector General Guide for
   Investigating Officers and Commander-Directed Investigation (CDI) Guide, referenced in
   paragraph 5.1.1.3 of this Instruction, for additional information about interviewing witnesses.
   6.2.12. Witnesses, GAIB members, GAIB advisors, reporters, or stenographers, and all other
   participants must be properly cleared before they may participate in classified interviews.
   Remind participants in classified interviews that AFI 31-401 applies regarding the
   safeguarding of classified information. See paragraph 8.3.4 of this Instruction for restrictions
   on the release of classified information in the GAIB Report.
6.3. Interviewing SIB Witnesses.
   6.3.1. The SIB President will provide the GAIB President with a list of witnesses the SIB
   interviewed. The list will provide the name and contact information for each SIB witness.
      6.3.1.1. The GAIB is not required to interview all of the SIB witnesses, but all SIB
      witnesses should be contacted. If the SIB witness will not be interviewed, a notation
      should be made on the SIB witness list that indicates why the SIB witness was not
      interviewed (e.g., redundant testimony expected, irrelevant testimony expected, witness
      unavailable, relevant information obtained through other sources). Include the witness
      list in the Post-Investigation Memorandum detailed in paragraph 10.2 of this Instruction.
   6.3.2. The GAIB will not interview a SIB witness until the SIB President releases that
   witness.
   6.3.3. Before starting an interview, the GAIB interviewer will explain the differences
   between safety investigations and accident investigations to the witness. See advisement in
   paragraph 6.2.3 of this Instruction for appropriate language.
   6.3.4. SIB witnesses who have been promised confidentiality by safety investigators must
   not disclose privileged safety information to GAIB Members. If a witness begins to disclose
   privileged information, the interview must pause to remind the witness of the prohibition. To
   prevent such occurrences, witnesses should be reminded not to reference the safety board
 42                                                                    AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


   during the interview by making remarks such as, ―Like I told the safety board,‖ in their
   answers to the GAIB.
   6.3.5. If the GAIB receives a record of a witness interview or statement from the SIB, the
   GAIB President may ask the witness to adopt the prior testimony or statement as a sworn
   statement after the witness acknowledges the oath or affirmation.
       6.3.5.1. If the witness adopts his or her SIB testimony, the relevant transcript or record
       from the SIB shall be included in the GAIB Report as an attachment to the GAIB witness'
       testimony or interview summary if it is not already included in the SIB Part I.
6.4. Rights and Privileges of Witnesses.
   6.4.1. General Guidance.
       6.4.1.1. DoD personnel may not refuse to answer questions simply because their answers
       may adversely affect another person. They may only refuse to answer questions to
       prevent self-incrimination.
       6.4.1.2. Interviews should still be initiated even if the interviewer anticipates the witness
       will invoke his or her rights or privileges against self-incrimination, in order to make the
       invocation a matter of record.
   6.4.2. Military Witnesses.
       6.4.2.1. Articles 31(a) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. §§ 801-940)
       (UCMJ) provide that no persons subject to the UCMJ may be compelled to incriminate
       themselves or answer any question the answer to which may tend to incriminate them.
       6.4.2.2. Before questioning a military member the interviewer suspects committed an
       offense punishable under the UCMJ, the GAIB interviewer must advise the military
       witness of the rights provided by Articles 31(a) and (b) of the UCMJ. Use the rights
       advisement found at Figure 6.2 of this Instruction.
       6.4.2.3. When the interviewer does not suspect the military witness of violating the
       UCMJ until after beginning to question the witness, the interviewer will stop the
       interview as soon as he or she suspects a UCMJ violation and provide the rights
       advisement in Figure 6.2 of this Instruction.
       6.4.2.4. If, after being advised of his or her Article 31 UCMJ rights, the military witness
       requests a lawyer or elects to remain silent, the GAIB interviewer will stop the interview
       and refer the witness to the host installation Area Defense Counsel (ADC). After the
       witness consults with a defense attorney, contact the attorney to determine if the witness
       is willing to testify. If the witness is willing to testify, the GAIB interviewer will re-
       administer the rights advisement before questioning the witness. The witness’ attorney
       may attend the interview and provide legal advice to the witness during the interview.
       However, the attorney may not ask or answer questions on behalf of the witness, and may
       not interrupt or improperly interfere with the interview.
          6.4.2.4.1. If a military witness is not suspected of an offense punishable under the
          UCMJ, but invokes his/her right against self-incrimination, refer the witness to the
          host installation ADC.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                            43


       6.4.2.5. If, after rights advisement and (if requested) consultation with a defense
       attorney, a military member suspected of committing an offense punishable under the
       UCMJ agrees to testify under oath or affirmation, then the following statement should
       appear immediately before the witness’ testimony:
―Having been duly sworn and advised of the allegations, of [his/her] rights under Article 31,
Uniform Code of Military Justice, and of [his/her] rights to counsel, and having acknowledged
[his/her] understanding of those rights, and having affirmatively waived those rights, the witness
testified as follows:‖
       6.4.2.6. If no ADC is stationed at the host installation, contact the Host Installation SJA
       to obtain contact information for other defense counsel the witness may contact.
       6.4.2.7. For accidents involving ARC personnel, the GAIB President must determine
       what the duty status of the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard member being
       interviewed was at the time of the accident. The determination must be made prior to the
       interview because different duty statuses require different protections during the
       interview process. Consult the GAIB Legal Advisor for assistance in determining duty
       status and required protections. Include a copy of the interviewee’s orders, civilian or
       military pay stub, or duty roster for drill days in the GAIB Report. When ARC personnel
       are suspected of a crime, provide the appropriate rights advisement (Figure 6.2 or Figure
       6.3 of this Instruction) after verifying the witness’ duty status at the time of incident and
       at the time of the interview. Whenever possible, the GAIB should arrange to interview
       the witness at a time he/she is on federal military status.
   6.4.3. Federal Civilian Employee Witnesses.
       6.4.3.1. Disciplinary Examinations.
           6.4.3.1.1. If the employee is a member of a certified bargaining unit represented by a
           labor organization and both (1) reasonably believes that he or she might be
           disciplined as a result of the interview, and (2) requests union representation, then the
           employee is entitled to have a union official or steward present during the interview.
           This right is found in 5 U.S.C. § 7114(a)(2)(B) and is frequently referred to as the
           employee’s Weingarten rights.
           6.4.3.1.2. If the bargaining unit member requests union representation before or
           during the interview, the interviewer should consult with the Host Installation SJA.
           The interviewer’s options are (1) grant the request, (2) cancel the interview, or (3)
           offer the employee the choice of either conducting the interview unaccompanied by a
           union representative or having no interview at all.
           6.4.3.1.3. Weingarten rights belong to the employee, not to the union. If the
           employee does not ask for a union representative, then the union has no right to
           demand that a representative be present. The right exists for all federal civilian
           employees who are members of a certified bargaining unit, whether they are members
           of the union or not. Do not ask the employee if he or she is a member of the union,
           but you may ask the member if he or she is a member of the bargaining unit for
           purposes of determining whether they have Weingarten rights.
 44                                                                    AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


           6.4.3.1.4. The law does not require an employee be notified of their Weingarten
           rights prior to the interview. However, some local union contracts stipulate that
           management officials of an installation will provide notice before each interview.
           Exercise caution when interviewing federal civilian employees to ensure there are no
           violations of the terms of a local contract.
       6.4.3.2. Formal Discussions.
           6.4.3.2.1. During a ―formal discussion,‖ the union has a right for a union
           representative to be present and the employee must be advised of his/her Brookhaven
           rights, i.e., certain safeguards set out by the Federal Labor relations Authority to
           protect employees from coercive questioning concerning matters involving their
           statutorily protected rights. A formal discussion applies only to discussions that
           concern a grievance, personnel policy or practice or other general condition of
           employment. These terms are defined broadly by the Federal Labor Relations
           Authority. These are not normally the subjects of a GAIB witness interview, which
           more likely would seek to establish an employee’s specific actions, conduct, and
           observations relevant to the mishap at issue. However, questions about workplace
           actions, the workplace atmosphere, or general environment of the work center (e.g.,
           how often did personnel use government owned or leased vehicles for personal use)
           are considered discussions about ―general conditions of employment.‖ If there is any
           question whether an interview might constitute a formal discussion, which would
           require union notice, the GAIB Legal Advisor should consult with the Host
           Installation SJA or the Labor Law Field Support Center at AFLOA/JACL.
           6.4.3.2.2. A union official, steward or other representative attending a GAIB witness
           interview may advise the federal employee who is being interviewed, but may not ask
           or answer questions on behalf of the witness, and may not interrupt or improperly
           interfere with the interview.
       6.4.3.3. Rights Advisements.
           6.4.3.3.1. Before questioning a civilian employee suspected by the interviewer of
           committing a violation of federal or local state criminal law, consult the convening
           authority’s SJA for guidance on how to proceed. The Fifth Amendment to the United
           States Constitution provides rights to persons that are not subject to the UCMJ. The
           convening authority’s SJA should consider whether to consult with the Host
           Installation SJA in order to determine whether or not civilian criminal investigators
           should become involved. If the GAIB President decides to interview the witness, first
           provide the rights advisement in Figure 6.3 of this Instruction.
           6.4.3.3.2. If after rights advisement, the civilian employee agrees to testify under
           oath or affirmation, then the following statement should appear immediately before
           the witness’ testimony:
―Having been duly sworn and advised of [his/her] rights under the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States, and of [his/her] rights to counsel, and having acknowledged
[his/her] understanding of those rights, and having affirmatively waived those rights, the witness
testified as follows:‖
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                            45


       6.4.3.4. In appropriate cases, a witness may have both a union representative and legal
       counsel present during an interview. However, only the GAIB members may ask
       questions and only the witness may answer questions during the interview.
   6.4.4. DoD Contractor Employee Witnesses.
       6.4.4.1. The GAIB President may choose to have an Air Force contract management
       representative present when interviewing employees of DoD contractors. The contract
       management representative may be able to help obtain company records and determine
       company policies. In addition, this representative may provide assistance if the employee
       contends that rights under a contractor’s labor-management agreement are being
       abridged.
       6.4.4.2. Before questioning a contractor employee the interviewer suspects committed a
       crime of federal or local state law, consult the convening authority’s SJA for guidance on
       how to proceed. The convening authority’s SJA should consider whether to consult with
       the Host Installation SJA in order to determine whether or not civilian criminal
       investigators should become involved. If the GAIB President decides to interview the
       witness, first provide the rights advisement in Figure 6.3 of this Instruction.
       6.4.4.3. If after rights advisement, the contractor employee agrees to testify under oath or
       affirmation, then the following statement should appear immediately before the witness’
       testimony:
―Having been duly sworn and advised of [his/her] rights under the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States, and of [his/her] rights to counsel, and having acknowledged
[his/her] understanding of those rights, and having affirmatively waived those rights, the witness
testified as follows:‖
   6.4.5. Other Witnesses.
       6.4.5.1. The GAIB President should allow other witnesses to bring appropriate advisors
       to an interview. However, only GAIB members may ask questions and only the witness
       may answer questions during the interview.
       6.4.5.2. Before questioning a civilian witness the interviewer suspects committed a crime
       under federal or local state law, consult the convening authority’s SJA for guidance on
       how to proceed. The convening authority’s SJA should consider whether to consult with
       the Host Installation SJA in order to determine whether or not civilian criminal
       investigators should become involved. If the GAIB President decides to interview the
       witness, first provide the rights advisement in Figure 6.3 of this Instruction.
       6.4.5.3. If after rights advisement, the witness agrees to testify under oath or affirmation,
       then the following statement should appear immediately before the witness’ testimony:
―Having been duly sworn and advised of [his/her] rights under the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States, and of [his/her] rights to counsel, and having acknowledged
[his/her] understanding of those rights, and having affirmatively waived those rights, the witness
testified as follows:‖
       6.4.5.4. Consult the convening authority’s SJA for guidance on interviewing foreign
       military personnel and foreign nationals that the GAIB interviewer suspects, or comes to
 46                                                                     AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


      suspect, of acting in violation of United States (federal and state) criminal laws or the
      criminal laws of the witnesses’ countries of citizenship.
6.5. Preserving Witness Testimony.
   6.5.1. Record the testimony of each witness. This is a requirement even when witnesses are
   interviewed by telephone or by video teleconference. See paragraph 6.2.2 of this Instruction
   for additional requirements for telephone or video teleconference interviews.
      6.5.1.1. Record the witness introduction and administration of the oath or affirmation. In
      addition, record the date, time, and place of interview, as well as the persons present.
      Before recording questions and answers, record the witness saying his or her full name,
      rank, job title, and present duty assignment and location.
          6.5.1.1.1. See paragraph 8.3.7 of this Instruction for guidance as to whether the
          names of individuals involved in a mishap will be included in the final GAIB report.
      6.5.1.2. Before beginning the audio recording, conduct a pre-interview to obtain the
      witness’ Social Security number, home address, duty phone, home telephone number,
      and any other protected information. Include this information with the Post-Investigation
      Memorandum required by paragraph 10.2 of this Instruction.
      6.5.1.3. Do not permit witnesses to talk with their hands, since this cannot be transcribed.
      Similarly, ask the witnesses to answer "Yes" or "No" rather than nodding their heads or
      responding "Uh-huh." If witnesses testify using a diagram, ask them to mark or place
      numbers where events or actions occurred. Include the diagram in the GAIB Report as
      an attachment to the appropriate interview transcript or summary. If witnesses describe
      distances with their hands, translate the distance for the record (e.g., "For the record, the
      witness is holding his hands approximately three feet apart").
   6.5.2. Reduce witness testimony to writing by transcribing the testimony verbatim or by
   summarizing the relevant portions of the testimony. Include the transcript or summary in
   Tab V of the GAIB Report. See Figure 6.1 of this Instruction for a recommended format for
   summarizing testimony.
      6.5.2.1. If the witness’ testimony is critical, have the recording transcribed in its entirety.
      However, if only a small portion of the testimony is valuable, or if exact words are not
      important, the testimony may be summarized.
      6.5.2.2. Ask the individual who will transcribe the interviews to verify the suitability and
      quality of the recording equipment before starting the interviews.
      6.5.2.3. The interviewer should take thorough interview notes to assist in writing a
      coherent, accurate summary of witness testimony.
      6.5.2.4. If a witness’ interview is summarized, the witness should sign the summary.
      Before the witness signs the summary, place the witness under oath or affirmation. The
      witness may sign the interview summary in person or by mail.
          6.5.2.4.1. If the witness is not available in the immediate area, the GAIB President
          may e-mail or fax the witness a copy of his or her statement to review and sign. The
          witness should email or fax the signed signature page back to the GAIB President and
          mail the original signed signature page to the GAIB President.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                       47


         6.5.2.4.2. Since interview summaries are included in the GAIB Report and are
         publicly releasable, do not include privacy information (e.g., Social Security
         numbers, home addresses, home telephone numbers) in the summary.
         6.5.2.4.3. If a witness declines to sign a summarized statement on the grounds that it
         does not accurately reflect his or her testimony, review any audio recordings and
         notes with the witness and reach an agreement on what the witness said or intended.
         It is important the witness concurs with the summarized statement of his or her
         testimony. If agreement cannot be reached, use a verbatim transcript of the testimony
         instead of a summary.
  6.5.3. When preparing verbatim transcripts, double space between questions. Number all
  questions and answers included on the document using the following scheme: ―Q1‖ for the
  first question and ―A1‖ for the first answer, ―Q2‖ for the second question and ―A2‖ for the
  second answer, and so on. Use the same scheme when including verbatim questions and
  answers in statements of summarized testimony. Be sure verbatim transcripts clearly identify
  the individuals who are asking and answering each question.
  6.5.4. Define acronyms and technical terms used in the interview process since the public
  may not understand them.
  6.5.5. Package and label all audiotapes, interviewer notes, stenographer notes, and any items
  containing recordings of witness testimony. Send these items with the Post-Investigation
  Memorandum to the convening authority’s SJA for storage after the GAIB Report is
  approved. See paragraph 10.2 of this Instruction for guidance on post-investigation matters.

                                           Chapter 7

                               RELEASING INFORMATION

7.1. Prohibited Releases.
   7.1.1. Providing seriously injured individuals (or their representatives), NoK, and the public
   the results of an accident investigation conducted pursuant to this Instruction is a high
   priority for the Air Force. Unauthorized disclosure of information gathered by a GAIB or
   about the investigation itself disrupts and may adversely impact the accident investigation
   process. To avoid the problems that arise from an unauthorized disclosure of GAIB-related
   information, coordinate and release information about accident investigations and completed
   GAIB Reports in compliance with this chapter of this Instruction, AFI 33-332, DoD
   Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement, DoD 5400.11-R, Department of Defense Privacy
   Program, DoD 6025.18-R, and AFI 35-101.
   7.1.2. GAIB members, GAIB advisors, contractors, and federal government employees who
   have had or obtained access to GAIB-related information (e.g., evidence gathered by the
   GAIB and the contents of the GAIB Report) will not disclose that information for any
   purpose other than official and authorized purposes prior to the official public release of the
   GAIB Report. Prior to public release of the GAIB Report, the only authorized disclosures of
   GAIB information or the contents of a GAIB Report are for the purpose of facilitating the
   GAIB investigation. Any other disclosures must be specifically approved by the convening
   authority’s SJA.
       7.1.2.1. The prohibition of paragraph 7.1.2 of this Instruction does not apply to
       disclosures made IAW paragraph 7.2 of this Instruction or other disclosures made for
       official or authorized purposes.
       7.1.2.2. This prohibition does not preclude the GAIB from seeking information from any
       source during the investigation process to include disclosing information to a witness in
       order to fully develop questioning. In such cases, the witness shall be instructed not to
       disclose any information learned during the interview.
   7.1.3. Failure to comply with the prohibition of paragraph 7.1.2 of this Instruction by an
   active duty Air Force member, AFRC member in active duty or inactive duty for training
   status, or an ANG member in federal service, is a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ.
   7.1.4. Failure to comply with paragraph 7.1.2 of this Instruction by a DoD civilian employee
   may result in administrative disciplinary action independent of any actions for violation of
   applicable federal and state laws. Violations by DoD contractor personnel will be reported to
   the appropriate DoD or Air Force contracting official.
7.2. Early Release of Factual Information about the Accident.
   7.2.1. When the requirements of 10 U.S.C. § 2254, listed under paragraph 7.2.2 of this
   Instruction, have been satisfied, the convening authority, or their SJA unless such authority is
   withheld, shall authorize the public disclosure of unclassified recordings, scientific reports,
   and other factual information regarding the accident prior to public release of the GAIB
   Report. However, the requirements of paragraph 7.2.2 shall not limit the convening
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                           51


   authority’s ability to release factual information prior to public release of the GAIB Report
   when the convening authority deems it appropriate.
      7.2.1.1. If the accident involved military or civilian employees from other MAJCOMs,
      other DoD Components, or foreign military services, the release should be coordinated
      with the other officials and organizations involved before the authorization is made.
      Similar coordination may be needed or appropriate if the mishap involves a prominent
      public official.
      7.2.1.2. The convening authority’s PAO and SJA will provide assistance regarding
      contacting offices and officials outside the convening authority’s command. In addition,
      AFLOA/JACC will provide assistance as appropriate.
   7.2.2. Factual information within the possession of the GAIB shall be released prior to
   public release of the GAIB Report when each of the following conditions are met:
      7.2.2.1. The information is specifically requested, such as pursuant to the Freedom of
      Information Act or through a media inquiry.
      7.2.2.2. The information will be included in the releasable GAIB Report.
      7.2.2.3. Early release of the information will not impede the ability of investigators to
      continue conducting the accident investigation or any on-going safety investigation.
      7.2.2.4. The information would not be required to be withheld under the Freedom of
      Information Act. Information that is required to be withheld from public release includes
      classified information or information that would clearly warrant an invasion of an
      individual’s privacy that is not outweighed by the public interest in knowing how the Air
      Force conducts its mission.
   7.2.3. For purposes of paragraph 7.2 of this Instruction, ―factual information‖ includes
   documents, diagrams, photographs, and other evidence that will be included in the publicly
   releasable GAIB Report, but does not include any findings or opinion of the GAIB.
   7.2.4. The GAIB President will coordinate any early release with the convening authority’s
   PAO and SJA. See paragraph 7.5 of this Instruction for additional requirements when the
   accident investigation involves a High-Interest Mishap.
7.3. Release of Status Information about Accident-Related Response Actions and
Activities.
   7.3.1. It is important to keep seriously injured individuals (or their representatives), NoK,
   and the public informed of the status of accident-related response actions and activities that
   are separate from any safety investigation and the legal investigation of the mishap.
      7.3.1.1. Examples of these actions and activities include search and rescue operations,
      recovery of remains, salvage efforts, emergency response activities, and environmental
      remediation of the accident site.
   7.3.2. At any time, an appropriate authority may make a public disclosure of the status of
   accident-related response actions and activities described in paragraph 7.3.1 of this
   Instruction, as long as such information, at the time of disclosure, would not be required to be
   withheld under the Freedom of Information Act. Information that is required to be withheld
   from public release includes classified information or information that would clearly warrant
 52                                                                    AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


   an invasion of an individual’s privacy that is not outweighed by the public interest in
   knowing how the Air Force conducts its mission. In addition:
       7.3.2.1. The disclosure must not be likely to adversely impact any on-going safety
       investigation or ground accident investigation.
       7.3.2.2. The disclosure must not conflict with policy of the command or commands
       responsible for investigating the mishap and taking the accident-related response action
       or activity that is the subject of the release.
       7.3.2.3. Seriously injured individuals (or their representatives) involved in the accident
       and the NoK of individuals that died as a result of the accident will be notified before the
       disclosure is made to the media, the public, or individuals not involved in the accident.
       7.3.2.4. The disclosure must not precede notification to appropriate outside officials and
       organizations when the mishap involves military or civilian employees from outside
       MAJCOMs, other DoD Components, or foreign military services. Similar notification
       may be necessary or appropriate when the accident involves foreign nationals or
       prominent public figures.
          7.3.2.4.1. ―Outside officials and organizations‖ and ―outside MAJCOMs‖ refers to
          officials, organizations, and MAJCOMs other than the organization and MAJCOM to
          which the individual making the disclosure is assigned or attached.
          7.3.2.4.2. Consult the convening authority’s PAO and SJA for assistance in
          identifying when and where to make notifications under paragraph 7.3.2.4 of this
          Instruction.
   7.3.3. As used in paragraph 7.3.2 of this Instruction, ―appropriate authority‖ means an
   employee or office within the command or commands responsible for investigating the
   mishap and taking the accident-related response action or activity that is the subject of the
   disclosure of information.
       7.3.3.1. The GAIB President or GAIB Legal Advisor are considered an ―appropriate
       authority‖ for releasing information about accident-related response actions and
       activities.
7.4. Release of Status Information about the Accident Investigation.
   7.4.1. It is important to keep seriously injured individuals (or their representatives), NoK,
   and the public informed of the status of efforts to investigate an accident pursuant to this
   Instruction.
   7.4.2. The GAIB President is responsible for the release of all status information on the
   ground accident investigation and any safety investigation, to include the release of factual
   information regarding the accident that would not be required to be withheld under the
   Freedom of Information Act.
   7.4.3. The GAIB President must coordinate the release of status information about
   investigations with the convening authority’s SJA and PAO.
       7.4.3.1. The GAIB President may release information about the status of the accident
       investigation without prior approval from the Convening Authority, unless the accident is
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                           53


       a High-Interest Mishap. See paragraph 7.5 of this Instruction for applicable requirements
       when the accident investigation involves a High-Interest Mishap.
       7.4.3.2. Prior to disclosure of status information, notification to appropriate outside
       officials and organizations may be necessary or appropriate when the mishap involves
       military or civilian employees from outside MAJCOMs, other DoD Components, or
       foreign military services. Similar notification may be necessary or appropriate when the
       accident involves foreign nationals or prominent public figures.
           7.4.3.2.1. ―Outside officials and organizations‖ and ―outside MAJCOMs‖ refers to
           officials, organizations, and MAJCOMs other than the organization and MAJCOM to
           which the individual making the disclosure is assigned or attached.
       7.4.3.3. For purposes of this Instruction, releasing status information about investigations
       to seriously injured individuals or NoK will constitute public release of the information.
   7.4.4. When relaying status information on accident and safety investigations to seriously
   injured individuals (or their representatives), NoK of individuals who died as a result of the
   accident, and the public, the following guidance applies:
       7.4.4.1. Use Family Liaison Officers (FLOs) instead of the GAIB President or other
       GAIB members to provide status information on the investigations to seriously injured
       individuals (or their representatives) and NoK.
           7.4.4.1.1. Having a GAIB member provide the information could result in a situation
           where GAIB members are perceived as having lost their objectivity with regard to the
           accident investigation.
           7.4.4.1.2. Ideally, GAIB members should only contact seriously injured individuals
           and NoK to introduce themselves, conduct formal interviews, and/or perform post-
           investigation briefings required by paragraph 9.3.3 of this Instruction.
       7.4.4.2. The GAIB President may hold press conferences and issue press releases.
       However, release information to the seriously injured individuals and NoK before
       disclosing it in a press conference or press release.
7.5. High-Interest Mishaps. The provisions of this paragraph apply for accident investigations
of High-Interest Mishaps. These requirements apply in addition to or instead of, as appropriate,
the requirements specified in paragraphs 7.1 through 7.4 of this Instruction.
   7.5.1. High-Interest Mishaps are accidents in which there is loss of life, serious personal
   injuries, significant civilian property damage, or accidents that are likely to generate
   widespread media or congressional interest.
   7.5.2. Prior to an early release of factual information or disclosure of any status information
   under this chapter, any necessary or appropriate notification to appropriate outside officials
   and offices must be made.
       7.5.2.1. The requirements of paragraph 7.5.2 of this Instruction apply when the accident
       involves military or civilian employees from outside MAJCOMs, other DoD
       Components, or foreign military services. These requirements also apply when the
       accident involves foreign nationals or prominent public figures.
54                                                                   AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


     7.5.2.2. ―Outside officials and offices‖ and ―outside MAJCOMs‖ refers to officials,
     offices, organizations, and MAJCOMs other than the MAJCOM that convened the
     investigation.
  7.5.3. Prior to an early release of factual information or disclosure of any status information
  under Chapter 7 of this Instruction, notification must be made to seriously injured individuals
  (or their representatives) and the NoK of individuals who died as a result of the accident.
  7.5.4. At least two duty days prior to any disclosure to seriously injured individuals (or their
  representatives) or NoK under paragraph 7.4 of this Instruction, the convening authority’s
  SJA must coordinate with AFLOA/JACC for immediate distribution to The Judge Advocate
  General (TJAG) for his or her information and review. The convening authority’s SJA must
  forward the planned disclosure to AFLOA/JACC by e-mail or fax as part of this
  coordination. Coordinate early because disclosure may not occur before at least two days
  after TJAG receives the planned disclosure from AFLOA/JACC.
  7.5.5. If the High-Interest Mishap involves loss of life, the GAIB President must initiate an
  information disclosure about the status of the safety and accident investigations following
  arrival at the accident scene (or the location from which the SIB is working). Figure 7.1 is a
  sample initial information disclosure for High-Interest Mishaps involving a fatality.
     7.5.5.1. If the GAIB President follows the sample at Figure 7.1 when making the first
     release of status information about the investigations, and no specific investigation
     information is added, the notification and approval requirements of paragraph 7.5.4 of
     this Instruction do not apply.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                   55

                                           Chapter 8

                                    THE GAIB REPORT

8.1. Purpose. The GAIB President documents the results of the accident investigation in the
GAIB Report. As indicated in paragraph 1.1 of this Instruction, the GAIB Report is a publicly
releasable report of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident the GAIB investigated.
The GAIB Report includes an Executive Summary and Summary of Facts. When specifically
required by the Convening Authority, the GAIB Report also includes a Statement of Opinion on
the cause, causes, and/or factors that substantially contributed to the mishap.

       8.2.1.8. Cover sheet (back). Use a blank page.
   8.2.2. For Abbreviated Ground Accident Investigations, the format described in paragraph
   8.2.1 of this Instruction may be modified to the extent allowed under Chapter 11 of this
   Instruction.
8.3. Preparing the Report.
   8.3.1. The GAIB Report will contain factual information about the accident, including
   supporting documentary and testimonial evidence, as well as photographs and other graphics
   as required.
       8.3.1.1. The GAIB Legal Advisor will review all documents obtained from the SIB
       President to ensure they only reflect facts and do not draw ultimate conclusions about
       causation.
           8.3.1.1.1. The GAIB Legal Advisor will redact from the SIB Tabs information that is
           inappropriate for public release and safety-privileged information.
           8.3.1.1.2. Opinions and conclusions in technical analyses reports included in the SIB
           Part I are appropriate for public release.
   8.3.2. The GAIB Report will not include the following types of information:
       8.3.2.1. Recommendations or suggested corrective actions.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                         57


         8.3.2.1.1. Recommendations or concerns arising from the accident investigation.
         Consistent with paragraph 4.4.12 of this Instruction, the GAIB President will advise
         the convening authority of any recommendations or concerns in a separate document
         from the GAIB Report.
     8.3.2.2. Original personnel, training, medical, or flight records of individuals involved in
     the accident.
         8.3.2.2.1. Photocopies of relevant records may be included in the GAIB Report.
         Other records not included in the report should be noted as reviewed but not relevant

     emergency response to the mishap.
         8.3.2.3.1. Duplicates of recordings and photographs may be included in the GAIB
         Report. Editing or masking may be necessary to prevent violation of privacy or other
         applicable restrictions.
     8.3.2.4. Audio recordings or video recordings of witness interviews.
     8.3.2.5. Privileged safety information.
     8.3.2.6. Contractor propriety data.
     8.3.2.7. Any graphic description of injuries, including those descriptions routinely found
     in autopsy protocols, medical records, human remains' scatter diagrams, or photographs
     showing human remains.
     8.3.2.8. Any document that estimates or gives monetary damage amounts of potential or
     actual third-party claims against the government.
     8.3.2.9. Information that is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information
     Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552. See DoD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement, DoD Freedom
     of Information Act Program, for restrictions on disclosure of information that qualifies
     for exemption from the release requirements of the Freedom of Information Act. See
     also paragraph 8.3.3.2 of this Instruction regarding deployed/overseas personnel.
     8.3.2.10. Information protected by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a. See AFI 33-332,
     Privacy Act Program, for restrictions on disclosure of information protected by the
     Privacy Act.
     8.3.2.11. Information protected by the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. §§ 2751-
     2799aa, or the Export Administration Act of 1979, 50 U.S.C. App. §§ 2401-2420, except
     as provided in paragraph 8.3.3.3 of this instruction.
     8.3.2.12. Information that is classified, except as allowed by paragraph 8.3.4.1 of this
     Instruction.
  8.3.3. The GAIB Report will only include information that is publicly releasable.
  Information is not publicly releasable if a statute or regulation prohibits its disclosure or a
  non-government entity controls disclosure of the information.
58                                                                  AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


     8.3.3.1. The GAIB Legal Advisor should contact the convening authority’s SJA and/or
     AFLOA/JACC for assistance in determining if specific information is publicly releasable.
     8.3.3.2. For accidents occurring in or involving personnel assigned/deployed overseas,
     consult with the convening authority’s SJA to assess the applicability of redacting
     personally identifying information as permitted under 10 U.S.C. § 130b, and under FOIA
     exemptions 3 and 6. See paragraph 8.3.7.1 of this instruction.
     8.3.3.3. Maintenance documents, including Maintenance Manuals, Technical Orders, and
     Time Compliance Technical Orders may be subject to the Arms Export Control Act, 22
     U.S.C. §§ 2751-2799aa, or the Export Administration Act of 1979, 50 U.S.C. app. §§
     2401-2420. Obtain written approval from the Technical Content Manager (TCM) before
     including extracts of these publications in the GAIB Report. See AFI 61-204,
     Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information, for guidance on obtaining approval
     for inclusion of restricted technical information in the GAIB Report.
        8.3.3.3.1. Include the approval from the TCM in the Tabs to the Report and in the
        Post-Investigation Memorandum as required by paragraph 10.2 of this Instruction.
        8.3.3.3.2. If the TCM denies authorization to include technical information in the
        GAIB Report, the decision may be appealed through the TCM’s chain of command.
        8.3.3.3.3. The convening authority’s SJA may opt to have a TCM review the entire
        GAIB report after it is submitted for final review. Alternatively, if a TCM final
        review at the MAJCOM level is not anticipated, the GAIB legal advisor may consider
        asking the TCM to review the SIB Part I to ensure all technical data has been
        approved for public release.
  8.3.4. The GAIB Report will not include classified documents except as allowed in
  paragraph 8.3.4.1 of this Instruction.
     8.3.4.1. If classified documents are absolutely essential to support the Statement of
     Opinion, when the convening authority requires a Statement of Opinion, the GAIB
     President will include the classified testimony, documents, and information in a separate
     classified addendum. This will allow the unclassified portion of the GAIB Report to be
     publicly released without redacting text.
        8.3.4.1.1. Even though portions of an individual's testimony may be classified, it is
        not necessary to include the entire testimony in the classified addendum. Instead,
        include as much unclassified testimony as possible in the unclassified portion of the
        GAIB Report. It is recommended that two separate interviews (one classified and one
        unclassified) be conducted when classified information is germane to the
        investigation.
        8.3.4.1.2. If a classified interview does not yield information relevant to the cause of
        the mishap, do not transcribe the interview.
        8.3.4.1.3. Recordings of classified interviews, as with all interviews, should be
        provided to the convening authority’s SJA in accordance with paragraph 10.2.6 of
        this Instruction. See AFI 31-401 for instructions on how to protect and handle
        classified information, including tape recordings of classified interviews.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                           59


      8.3.4.2. If the GAIB Report includes a classified addendum, the unclassified portion of
      the report will disclose that a classified addendum exists.
   8.3.5. The GAIB Report will not include excerpts of instructions, regulations, and policy
   documents without also providing the corresponding front title pages of the documents.
   8.3.6. The GAIB Report is exempt from licensing with a report control symbol (RCS) under
   AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling
   Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections, paragraph 2.11.4.
   8.3.7. When possible, names of individuals involved in a mishap event should be disclosed
   in the GAIB report. However, DoD policy and federal law (The FOIA) requires names not to
   be released if it is determined doing so would or could constitute a clearly unwarranted
   invasion of personal privacy that is not outweighed by the public’s right to know how the Air
   Force performs its statutory mission. Usually, names of witnesses not involved in the mishap
   – particularly non-employee civilian witnesses – will not be included in the publicly
   releasable report as their names in and of themselves provide no information of how the Air
   Force conducts its mission. The inclusion of mishap personnel, GAIB members, and witness
   names in the publicly releasable GAIB report will be consistent with DoD policy on the
   release of DoD personnel names, the FOIA, and privacy concerns. The GAIB Legal Advisor
   will consult with the convening authority’s SJA with regards to whether the names of
   individuals involved in a mishap will be included in the GAIB report (to include both the
   narrative portion and all tabs) based on a FOIA analysis weighing public disclosure interests
   against individual safety/security/privacy interests.
      8.3.7.1. Additionally, for DoD personnel in overseas, sensitive, or routinely deployable
      units, personally identifiable information, including names, may be withheld. The
      HAF/IMII FOIA office (Chief, Information Office Support Division for the AF FOIA)
      maintains an updated list of overseas, sensitive, and routinely deployable units that are
      covered under this policy, which is based on 10 U.S.C. § 130b. The list may also be
      obtained through HQ USAF/JAA. ―Personally identifying information‖ according to 10
      U.S.C. § 130b, means the person’s name, rank, duty address, and official title and
      information regarding the person’s pay.
      8.3.7.2. If names of individuals involved in the mishap are omitted from the GAIB
      report, include an attachment to the post-investigation memorandum listing their names,
      their social security numbers, contact information, and a FOIA analysis provided by the
      convening authority’s SJA supporting the name omissions.
          8.3.7.2.1. Omitted names shall be replaced by job identifiers or roles in the mishap
          such as, mishap driver, mishap operator, mishap sensor operator, witness 1, etc.
   8.3.8. Remove all or part of all signatures from the report so the actual signature cannot be
   misused. If the signature is relevant to the mishap or investigation and if the entire signature
   is removed, replace it with a marking that states, ―signed.‖ If the signature is not relevant to
   the mishap or to the investigation, it may be removed entirely.
      8.3.8.1. The signature of the Board President is not removed from the copy of the report
      provided to the NoK or persons with serious injury.
8.4. Executive Summary.
 60                                                                   AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


   8.4.1. The Executive Summary is a brief statement of the basic facts surrounding the
   accident being investigated. When the convening authority requires that the GAIB Report
   include a Statement of Opinion, the Executive Summary includes a brief statement of the
   GAIB President’s opinion regarding the cause, causes, and/or factors that substantially
   contributed to the mishap.
   8.4.2. The Executive Summary is a stand-alone document. It must be complete and make
   sense without reference to the Summary of Facts, any Statement of Opinion required by the
   convening authority, or any other document.
   8.4.3. The Executive Summary should be written in a style that will be easily understood by
   the general public, much like a press release.
   8.4.4. The Executive Summary should be a one-page, single-spaced document that includes
   the following items:
      8.4.4.1. Date, time, and location of the accident.
      8.4.4.2. Identification of the equipment, vehicle, facility, system or other Air Force
      property involved in the accident by model number, serial number, facility code, or other
      appropriate designator.
      8.4.4.3. Brief summary of the facts and circumstances of the accident.
      8.4.4.4. Number of individuals injured and killed. This includes DoD military and
      civilian personnel, DoD contractor employees, and all other people.
      8.4.4.5. General description of property damage. This includes damage to DoD property
      and damage to property owned by commercial entities or private citizens who have no
      DoD affiliation.
      8.4.4.6. Abbreviated statement of opinion on the cause, causes, and/or factors that
      substantially contributed to the accident. This includes identification of the legal
      standards the GAIB President used to evaluate the evidence the GAIB collected. This
      requirement only applies when the convening authority requires that the GAIB Report
      include a Statement of Opinion.
   8.4.5. The Executive Summary will not include the names of individuals involved in the
   accident. Instead, it will refer to individuals by position or other general description (e.g.,
   Mishap Driver No. 1, Bystander, and Munitions Technician).
   8.4.6. The Executive Summary states findings in the third person form (e.g., ―The GAIB
   President found . . .‖).
   8.4.7. The GAIB President does not sign the Executive Summary.
   8.4.8. Figure 8.1 of this Instruction is the format used for the Executive Summary.
8.5. Summary of Facts.
   8.5.1. The Summary of Facts provides a thorough discussion of the relevant facts
   surrounding the accident being investigated.
   8.5.2. The Summary of Facts will present the facts in a narrative style.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                             61


   8.5.3. The Summary of Facts will not include conclusions or opinions about the cause,
   causes, and/or factors that substantially contributed to the accident.
   8.5.4. There is no standard length for the Summary of Facts.
      8.5.4.1. The length of the Summary of Facts will depend on the type of accident being
      investigated and the amount of information available to the GAIB.
      8.5.4.2. The Summary of Facts should be as comprehensive as necessary to meet the
      composition requirements specified in Chapter 8 of this Instruction.
   8.5.5. The Summary of Facts will be printed out on single-sided pages.
   8.5.6. The Summary of Facts must be self-contained and fully supported by evidence
   included in the GAIB Report. A reader must not have to refer to any other documents to
   understand the complete story of the accident.
      8.5.6.1. Each factual statement in the Summary of Facts should be followed by a
      parenthetical reference to the supporting evidence included in the Tabs of the GAIB
      Report. For instance, ―Several witnesses observed lightning strikes just before the
      accident. (Tabs V-1.6, V-4.9, V-5.16)‖ and ―Air Weather Service reports indicated
      severe thunderstorms in the area at the time. (Tab F-3).‖
   8.5.7. Arrange the Summary of Facts by items and address each item in the numerical order
   specified in Figure 8.2 of this Instruction. The Summary must address each listed item in
   Figure 8.2, even if only to state that the item is not applicable or is not relevant. Add items to
   the Summary if necessary to address other relevant issues.
8.6. Statement of Opinion.
   8.6.1. The Statement of Opinion presents the GAIB President’s personal opinion regarding
   the cause, causes, and/or substantially contributing factors of the accident being investigated.
   In those rare instances when a Statement of Opinion is required (see paragraph 4.1.2.4 of this
   Instruction), it must be clear, complete, and concise.
      8.6.1.1. The Statement of Opinion should be a brief document, normally no longer than
      three pages.
      8.6.1.2. The Statement of Opinion must not address matters outside the scope of the
      GAIB.
   8.6.2. The Statement of Opinion must be self-contained. A reader must not have to refer to
   any other document to know the GAIB President’s opinion and the bases for that opinion.
      8.6.2.1. The Statement of Opinion should mention specific facts that support the stated
      conclusions.
      8.6.2.2. The Statement of Opinion will not mention any facts that are not included in the
      Summary of Facts or supported by evidence located at Tabs within the GAIB Report.
   8.6.3. Standard of Proof. The Statement of Opinion must clearly state the standard used to
   make conclusions about the accident.
62                                                                    AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


     8.6.3.1. Use language such as, ―I find by clear and convincing evidence that the cause of
     the accident was . . .‖ and/or ―I find sufficient evidence to conclude that the following
     factors substantially contributed to the mishap: . . . .‖
  8.6.4. Provide an opinion about the cause or causes of the accident only when clear and
  convincing evidence supports the opinion.
     8.6.4.1. Each individual cause cited must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.
     8.6.4.2. Clear and convincing evidence enables the accident investigator to reach a
     conclusion without serious or substantial doubt. In other words, the opinion must be
     supported by credible evidence that shows it is highly probable that the conclusion is
     correct. However, clear and convincing evidence does not mean that another person,
     looking at the same facts, may not reach a different conclusion.
     8.6.4.3. Consult the GAIB Legal Advisor for guidance in determining if the available
     evidence meets the clear and convincing standard of proof.
  8.6.5. Substantially Contributing Factors. If the GAIB President is unable to determine a
  cause, he/she shall describe the factors, if any, which substantially contributed to the mishap.
  In cases where the GAIB President is able to determine the cause(s) of the mishap, he/she
  may also describe substantially contributing factors.
     8.6.5.1. Fully explain the direct connection between each substantially contributing
     factor and the accident.
     8.6.5.2. Each substantially contributing factor must be supported by a preponderance of
     evidence. A preponderance of evidence is the greater weight of credible evidence.
     8.6.5.3. Evidence Considered.      When weighing the evidence, consider all available
     evidence including:
         8.6.5.3.1. Direct evidence, i.e., that is based on actual knowledge or observation of
         witnesses, and
         8.6.5.3.2. Indirect evidence, i.e., facts or statements from which reasonable
         inferences, deductions, and conclusions may be drawn to establish an unobserved
         fact, knowledge, or state of mind.
     8.6.5.4. Weighing Evidence. The weight of the evidence is not determined by the
     number of witnesses or exhibits but by considering all the evidence and evaluating
     factors such as a witness’ behavior, opportunity for knowledge, information possessed,
     ability to recall and related events and relationship to the matter being considered.
  8.6.6. Date and sign the Statement of Opinion as ―President, Ground Accident Investigation
  Board.‖
  8.6.7. When preparing the Statement of Opinion, begin the Statement on a new page and
  copy it onto single-sided pages.
  8.6.8. Figure 8.3 of this Instruction is the format for the Statement of Opinion.
     8.6.8.1. Prepare a Statement of Opinion and include it in the GAIB Report only when it
     is requested by the Convening Authority. A thorough, well-documented GAIB
     investigation allows the facts to speak for themselves.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                        63


8.7. Tabs.
   8.7.1. The evidence gathered by the GAIB and placed into the report is organized using
   Tabs.
   8.7.2. Tabs A through S of the GAIB Report are reserved for evidence included in Part I of
   the SIB Report. See AFI 91-204, Chapter 6 and AFMAN 91-224, Ground Safety
   Investigations and Reports, for additional guidance on the type of information included in
   Part I of the SIB report.
      8.7.2.1. Part I of the SIB report contains factual non-privileged information arranged by
      Tabs. Part I of a formal privileged safety report is inserted into the GAIB Report as Tabs
      A through S. The SIB for a ground mishap is only instructed to use, at a minimum, Tabs
      A, B, C, G, O, Q, R and S IAW AFMAN 91-224, Chapter 6. Do not add the Tabs the
      SIB did not use. New evidence gathered by the GAIB must be inserted into new Tabs,
      e.g. Tabs T through AA.
      8.7.2.2. If there is no formal SIB report, insert the appropriate, non-privileged evidence
      received from the Safety Investigation in the relevant Tabs A through S of the GAIB
      report.
      8.7.2.3. See AFI 91-204, Chapter 6, and AFMAN 91-224, Chapter 6, for information
      about SIB reports.
   8.7.3. An Index of Tabs will be included in the GAIB Report immediately preceding
   individual Tabs.
      8.7.3.1. The Index of Tabs will identify all Tabs contained in the GAIB Report. Figure
      8.4 is a sample format that may be used for preparing the Index of Tabs.
      8.7.3.2. A separate Tab Index will be created for each Tab that contains sub-Tabs. Each
      individual Tab Index will be placed in the GAIB Report immediately preceding the first
      sub-Tab included in the individual Tab. Figure 8.5 is a sample format that may be used
      for preparing an index for a Tab that contains sub-Tabs.
   8.7.4. Separate Tabs identify different types of evidence. For example, Tab S contains
   photographs; Tab V contains statements from witnesses and summaries of witness
   interviews. Sub-Tabs should be used when a Tab contains multiple documents.
      8.7.4.1. Number each page of the documents contained in Tabs or sub-Tabs in numeric
      order with the appropriate Tab letter followed by a dash and number (Tab W-1, W-2,
      etc.). For example, Tab Z contains photographs; Tab Z-1 contains a photograph of the
      mishap vehicle and Tab Z-2 a map of the mishap area.
      8.7.4.2. Each witness interview should be documented in a separate sub-Tab of Tab V.
      For example, Tab V-5 is summarized testimony for Private Daniel Willhide’s first
      interview, Tab V-6 is the summarized testimony of Private Willhide’s second interview,
      and Tab V-7 is the verbatim transcript of the interview of Captain Mabelle Fortner. For
      each witness interview sub-Tab, number each page by placing the appropriate number
      following a decimal point that is placed after the sub-Tab number. For example, the
      fourth page of a witness statement identified as Tab V-3 would be referenced as ―Tab V-
      3.4.‖ A reference to pages 5 and 6 of the witness statement identified as Tab V-3 would
      be cited as ―Tab V-3.5 - 3.6‖ or ―Tab V-3.5 thru V-3.6.‖
64                                                                 AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


  8.7.5. When providing a source for evidence in the Summary of Facts or Statement of
  Opinion, reference the Tab or Sub-tab number and appropriate page number or numbers. For
  example, if two different witnesses said the truck rolled over and then exploded, the
  Summary of Facts might say, ―Two eyewitnesses saw the truck roll over and then explode
  (Tab V-6.4, V-8.2 thru V-8.3).‖
  8.7.6. Include documents, photographs, recordings, and other types of evidence in the GAIB
  Report under one or more of the Tabs listed below.
     8.7.6.1. Tab A - Distribution Memorandum and Safety Investigator Information.

     8.7.6.15. Tab O - Any Additional Substantiating Data and Reports. This is supporting
     data not otherwise defined. It can include, for instance, local operating instructions and
     training records.
     8.7.6.16. Tab P – Damage and Injury Summaries. This lists the total damage to all
     government property, materiel, and equipment.

     the SIB to the GAIB.
     8.7.6.18. Tab R - Releasable Witness Testimony.
         8.7.6.18.1. The GAIB may exclude any non-relevant or inappropriate interviews
         contained in Tab R.

AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                         65


     Consult the GAIB Legal Advisor for assistance in determining duty status of Air Force
     and ARC civilian and military personnel involved in the accident.
     8.7.6.21. Tab U - Maintenance Records Not included in Tabs D or O.
     8.7.6.22. Tab V - GAIB Witness Testimony and Statements. This includes sworn and
     unsworn statements made by witnesses, and summaries of witness interviews prepared by
     the GAIB President.
        8.7.6.22.1. Each interview in Tab V shall have a header and/or footer stating the
        name of the interviewee. For example, ―Interview of Captain Mabelle Fortner.‖ If a
        name is not releasable in accordance with para 8.3.7.1 of this Instruction, either
        replace the name with the interviewee's initials (e.g. "Captain M.F.") or position (e.g.
        "Witness #1").
     8.7.6.23. Tab W - Statements of Injury and Death. This Tab contains statements that
     identify the injuries or death resulting from the accident being investigated. It must not
     include information that violates the provisions of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, as
     implemented by AFI 33-332, DoD 6025.18-R, DoD Health Information Privacy
     Regulation, or constitutes a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under the
     Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, as implemented by DoD Regulation
     5400.7/Air Force Supplement, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program. Provide
     information about injuries and death only to the degree of detail sufficient to support the
     findings and conclusions. Avoid graphic descriptions of trauma or injuries. Do not
     include the autopsy protocol. Be mindful of potential sensitivities of the seriously injured
     individuals and NoK. The medical member should draft a general statement indicating
     the cause of death or injury and describe any abnormal laboratory test results or other
     medical factors affecting the performance of Air Force personnel involved in the
     accident.
     8.7.6.24. Tab X - GAIB Appointment Documents. This includes all documents that

     documents that are relevant and applicable to the accident being investigated. Ensure the
     documents included in the Tab are the version that was current at the time of the mishap
     and are not restricted from public release. If a document is long, the GAIB President
     should obtain a complete copy but only include in this Tab the cover pages and relevant
     portions of the document.
 66                                                                    AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


   8.7.7. Remove Controlled Unclassified Information such as ―For Official Use Only‖
   markings, Social Security numbers, home addresses, home telephone numbers, and other
   protected information from SIB Report documents before including them in the GAIB
   Report. See paragraph 8.3.2 of this Instruction for restrictions on GAIB Report content.
       8.7.7.1. Before redacting or masking ―For Official use Only‖ or Controlled Unclassified
       Information markings, make sure the document is publicly releasable.
   8.7.8. Create additional Tabs for the GAIB Report to accommodate any evidence the GAIB

     are not publicly releasable and are not included in the GAIB Report.
  9.1.6. The convening authority’s SJA performs a formal legal review of the final GAIB
  Report and forwards the legal review and final GAIB Report to the convening authority with
  a recommendation regarding approval.
     9.1.6.1. The legal review will assess whether the accident investigation and resulting
     GAIB Report meet the requirements of this Instruction.
     9.1.6.2. The legal review will address the legal sufficiency of findings and conclusions
     contained in GAIB Report components.

     the accident investigation and resulting Report complied with applicable laws and
     regulations.
     9.1.7.2. Unless the convening authority indicates otherwise, approval alone does not
     mean the convening authority agrees with the GAIB President’s conclusions or with any
     Statement of Opinion included in the Report.
     9.1.7.3. The convening authority’s SJA will prepare an appropriate document to
     announce the convening authority’s action on the GAIB Report. Once signed by the
     convening authority, the document will be placed under the front cover of the GAIB
     Report and distributed with the Report.
  9.1.8. During the GAIB Report review process described in paragraphs 9.1.3 through 9.1.6

   individuals (or their representatives) and NoK, see Attachment 7 of this Instruction. See AFI
   34-1101 for guidance on other support provided to NoK.
       9.3.3.1. Normally, the GAIB President serves as the primary briefing officer. If multiple
       briefings are necessary, the convening authority may select additional briefing officers in
       order to allow simultaneous briefing of the injured individuals (or their representatives)
       or NoK families.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                           79


          9.3.3.1.1. When multiple briefings are scheduled but will not occur at the same time,
          the briefing officer will ask briefing recipients to refrain from talking to the media or
          public about matters that were briefed until after completion of scheduled briefings to
          seriously injured individuals (or their representatives) and the NoK of individuals that
          died as a result of the accident. The purpose of the request is to ensure the last
          individuals briefed receive factual information from the briefing officer before they
          receive it from other sources (i.e., other individuals who were briefed, reporters or the
          media).
      9.3.3.2. At his or her discretion, the convening authority may offer copies of the GAIB
      Report and briefings to relatives and/or close friends of deceased individuals who are not
      NoK. Similarly, the convening authority may offer briefings to individuals who suffered
      non-serious personal injury or substantial property damage as a result of the mishap.
      9.3.3.3. The briefing officer has the following duties:
          9.3.3.3.1. To personally express the condolences of the Department of the Air Force
          for the serious injury or death resulting from the accident.
          9.3.3.3.2. To personally deliver a paper copy of the GAIB Report.
          9.3.3.3.3. To provide a basic briefing on the accident investigation and GAIB Report.
          9.3.3.3.4. To answer questions about the accident during or at the conclusion of the
          briefing. Answers must be based on the facts contained in the GAIB Report.
   9.3.4. The convening authority’s SJA will provide training to Air Force personnel who will
   conduct briefings required by paragraph 9.3.3 of this Instruction. Representatives from other
   members of the convening authority’s headquarters staff (e.g., Public Affairs, Mental Health,
   Casualty Assistance, Mortuary Affairs, and Surgeon General) will help provide training, as
   appropriate.
      9.3.4.1. When multiple briefings are scheduled, the trainers will ensure each briefing
      officer fully understands the results of the GAIB and will clearly brief those results. This
      requirement is necessary to control the quality of separate briefings and make certain
      each audience receives substantially the same briefing.
9.4. Handling Requests for the Approved GAIB Report.
   9.4.1. The convening authority’s SJA is the release authority for the GAIB report unless this
   authorization is withheld by the convening authority.
   9.4.2. The release authority responds to requests for the approved GAIB Report IAW AFI
   33-332, and DoD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement.
      9.4.2.1. Upon request, provide one free copy of the GAIB Report to any individual who
      suffered non-serious personal injury or substantial property damage as a result of the
      mishap.
      9.4.2.2. Normally, the fees specified in DoD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement
      should be charged for providing copies of the Report or portions of the Report to
      requesters.
80                                                             AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


     9.4.2.2.1. If the requester was seriously injured in the accident or is a NoK or close
     family member, do not charge for a reasonable number of copies.
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                         81

                                          Chapter 11

              ABBREVIATED GROUND ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS

11.1. General Considerations.
   11.1.1. An abbreviated investigation conducted pursuant to Chapter 11 of this Instruction has
   the same purpose and basic investigation and support requirements as an investigation
   conducted IAW the other chapters of this Instruction, but with appropriate modifications to
   save time and resources. Strict compliance with the rules and procedures specified in
   Chapters 1 through 10 of this Instruction is not required for investigations performed IAW
   Chapter 11 of this Instruction.
11.2. Authorization.
   11.2.1. The convening authority may authorize or direct the GAIB President to conduct an
   abbreviated ground accident investigation pursuant to Chapter 11 of this Instruction under
   only the following circumstances:
      11.2.1.1. When the accident is classified as a Class A mishap solely because the damage
      to government property is expected to be $2,000,000 or more.
      11.2.1.2. When the convening authority exercised discretion under paragraph 1.4 and 1.5
      of this Instruction to direct that the provisions of this Instruction apply to a B, C, D, or
      lesser class of ground accident.
   11.2.2. Even if otherwise authorized by paragraph 11.2.1 of this Instruction, an abbreviated
   accident investigation might not be appropriate for a High-Interest Mishap or if there is a
   reasonable likelihood that tort claims, litigation, disciplinary or other adverse personnel
   action, serious personal injury, or death will result from the accident. See paragraph 7.5.1 of
   this Instruction for the definition of High-Interest Mishap.
11.3. Convening the GAIB.
   11.3.1. An abbreviated ground accident investigation should be convened at the same level
   of command that convened any corresponding safety investigation.

          Investigation Course) prior to appointment.
          11.3.2.1.2. The GAIB Legal Advisor should be a senior captain (O-3) with
          experience or formal training on conducting investigations. Formal training on
          mishap investigation (e.g., Aircraft Accident Investigation Course or AIB Legal
          Advisor Course) is required, but this requirement may be waived by AFLOA/JACC
          in exceptional circumstances.
      11.3.2.2. For all mishaps:
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                       89


          11.3.2.2.1. The convening authority may appoint other GAIB members in addition to
          the GAIB President and GAIB Legal Advisor, and may detail GAIB advisors as
          needed. Each GAIB member and GAIB advisor should have extensive knowledge,
          training, and/or experience in the specialty area for which they serve as a GAIB
          member or GAIB advisor.
          11.3.2.2.2. The convening authority may detail a Recorder to assist with
          administrative needs of the GAIB as directed by the GAIB President.

          in the accident. See paragraph 2.2.5 of this Instruction for guidance on the
          appointment of GAIB members from other DoD Components.
          11.3.2.2.5. If the accident involves foreign military personnel or property, an
          appropriate representative of each foreign military service whose resources were
          involved in the mishap may be appointed to the GAIB or serve as a GAIB advisor.

      determines is appropriate.
          11.5.1.2.1. Witness testimony may be preserved through interview summaries that

§—--Section

TERMS
Accident—An unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage or injury
and meets Class A, B, C, or D mishap reporting criteria in accordance with DoDD 6055.07 and
AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, Chapter 1. Damage or injury includes: damage
to DoD property; occupational illness to DoD military or civilian personnel; injury to DoD
military personnel on- or off-duty; injury to on-duty DoD civilian personnel; damage to public or
private property, or injury or illness to non-DoD personnel caused by Air Force operations.
Unless otherwise indicated, the term ―accident‖ is used interchangeably with the term ―mishap‖
throughout this Instruction.
Accident Investigation—A legal investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding an
accident that involves personal injury, death, and/or property damage. Accident investigations
conducted under AFI 51-507 focus on on-duty mishaps involving Air Force military members,
civilian employees, and/or structures, vehicles, systems, facilities, or other property. These
investigations are limited to ground and afloat mishaps because AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident
Investigations, provides rules and procedures for investigating Air Force accidents involving
aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, missiles, and space systems or equipment. Air Force accident
investigations may be used to preserve evidence for use in litigation, adjudication of tort claims,
disciplinary actions, adverse administrative actions, and for other purposes.
Adverse Information— Information that constitutes: 1) a violation of criminal law; the UCMJ;
DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER); the Anti-Deficiency Act; DoD Directives and
Instructions; Air Force Instructions; or military or civilian personnel policies; 2) an abuse of
authority, especially when an element of personal benefit accrues to the official, a family
member, or an associate; 3) fraud, waste, and abuse or mismanagement, governed by this
instruction or involving non-appropriated funds or morale, welfare, and recreation assets,
including personnel and facilities, as governed by AFI 34-124, Air Force Morale, Welfare, and
Recreation Advisory Board (AFMWRAB) and AFI 34-202, Protecting Non-appropriated Funds
Assets; 4) misconduct by a medical provider requiring actions to suspend, limit, or revoke
clinical privileges, as governed by AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations; 5) prohibited
discrimination or sexual harassment as described by AFI 36-2706, Military Equal Opportunity
(MEO) Program and AFI 36-1201, Equal Employment Opportunity Complaints; 6) a matter not
included above which may reflect adversely on the individual’s judgment or exercise of
authority.
Adverse Personnel Action— Any action taken that affects or has a potential to affect the
current position or career of a member of the Armed Forces or civilian Department of Defense
employee. Such actions include (but are not limited to): 1) disciplinary or other corrective
action (e.g. court-martial, nonjudicial punishment, Letter of Reprimand, Letter of Counseling,
etc.); 2) a significant adverse change in duties or responsibilities (e.g. relief of command,
transfer, reassignment, etc.) inconsistent with the military member’s rank; 3) adverse
performance evaluation; 4) a demotion. See AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints
Resolution, for additional information.
Advisor—An individual with sufficient knowledge, skill, or training in a specific subject matter
to be considered an expert in that subject area. Appropriate DoD military members and civilian
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                          97


employees may serve Ground Accident Investigation Boards (GAIBs) as advisors.              GAIB
Advisors are detailed to assist the Board, but are not members of the Board.
Afloat Accident—Any accident on board, or resulting from the operation of, an Air Force
vessel. This includes Air Force diving or swimmer operations. This term includes accidents that
occur during loading and/or off-loading, or receiving services at dockside. It also includes
accidents occurring up to the high water mark during amphibious or inshore warfare training
operations. It applies to all injuries to Air Force personnel occurring on board, whether or not
job-related. This term does not include accidents that qualify as one of the major categories of
mishaps covered by this Instruction (e.g., explosives and/or chemical agent mishaps). The term
does not apply to injuries Air Force personnel assigned to a vessel received away from the
vessel, whether or not the injuries are job-related.
Air Reserve Component—The combined units, organizations, members, equipment and other
property resources of the Air National Guard of the United States and the Air Force Reserve
Command when the units, organizations, and members are on Title 10 active duty. Air National
Guard and Air Force Reserve Command technicians are part of the Air Reserve Component.
Military status starts upon beginning duty for military pay or points and ends when duty stops.
Cause—A cause is an act, omission, condition, or circumstance that either starts or sustains an
accident sequence. It may be an element of human or mechanical performance. A given act,
omission, condition, or circumstance is a "cause" if correcting, eliminating, or avoiding it would
have prevented the mishap.
Chemical Agent—A chemical compound intended for use in military operations to kill,
seriously injure, or incapacitate persons through its chemical properties. Excluded are riot
control agents, chemical herbicides, smoke, and flame-producing devices.          Pesticides,
insecticides, and industrial chemicals, unless they are selected by the DoD or Air Force for
chemical warfare purposes, are also excluded from this definition.
Chemical Agent Accident—Any unintentional or uncontrolled release of a chemical agent
when: 1) reportable damage to property from contamination or costs are incurred for
decontamination; 2) individuals exhibit physiological symptoms of chemical agent exposure; or
3) the chemical agent quantity released to the atmosphere is such that a serious potential for
exposure is created by exceeding the applicable maximum allowable concentration-time levels
for exposure of unprotected workers, the general population, or property.
Clear and Convincing Evidence—Evidence that enables the GAIB President to make a
determination without serious or substantial doubt. In other words, evidence that shows that it is
highly probable that the conclusion is correct. This standard of proof applies to accident
investigations. It requires less certainty than the ―beyond a reasonable doubt‖ standard, which
requires determinations be made based on almost absolute certainty, but more certainty than the
―preponderance of evidence‖ standard, which only requires conclusions be supported by the
greater weight of credible evidence. The weight of evidence supporting a conclusion is not
determined by the sheer number of witnesses or the volume of documents presented, but rather
by the evidence which best accords with reason and probability.
Colonel (or civilian equivalent)—Any Regular Air Force active duty, Air Force Reserve, or Air
National Guard officer in the grade of O-6; or an officer who has been selected for promotion to
the grade of O-6, but has not yet assumed that grade; or an Air Force civil service employee in
 98                                                                   AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010


the grade of GS-15. For purposes of this Instruction, these individuals will be referred to as
colonels (or civilian equivalent).
Combat Training Accident—Any accident involving property damage or reportable injury
during participation in base exercises, combat simulated exercises, obstacle/confidence courses,
and inspector general exercises that test combat capability.
Contractor Accident—Injury or occupational illness to contractor personnel, or damage to
contractor property or equipment.
Convening Authority—The individual responsible for conducting the legal (accident)
investigation of an on-duty accident involving Air Force personnel or property. The convening
authority initiates the accident investigation by convening a Ground Accident Investigation
Board and closes the investigation by approving the GAIB Report prepared about the
investigation.
Direct Cost— Direct mishap costs ONLY include property damage costs (DoD and non-DoD)
and environmental cleanup costs. According to DoDI 6055.07 Enclosure E4.12.2, calculate the
direct cost of an accident by adding all costs of damaged or destroyed assets, including resultant
costs such as environmental decontamination, property clean-up, and restoration. The direct cost
of damage to DoD or non-DoD property will be computed using the actual cost of repair or
replacement (including work hours for repair), or the best official estimate available.
Directed Energy—An umbrella term covering technologies that relate to the production of a
beam of concentrated electromagnetic energy, atomic particles, or subatomic particles.
Directed Energy Accident—A directed energy weapon accident or directed energy device
accident.
Directed Energy Device—A system using directed energy primarily for a purpose other than as
a weapon.

DoD Component—The Department of Defense and all it parts and subordinate organizations, to
include all military departments, all military services, and all Department of Defense agencies.
Evidence—Information or data upon which a conclusion or judgment may be based. Evidence
is simply information that tends to prove or disprove the existence of a fact.
Executive Summary—A brief statement of the basic facts surrounding the accident being
investigated and, when required by the Convening Authority, the GAIB President’s opinion
regarding the cause, causes, and/or factors that substantially contributed to the mishap. The
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                            99

Host Installation—The Air Force installation nearest to the accident, unless host installation
responsibilities are assigned to an Air Reserve Component installation. The host installation
responds to the mishap and provides administrative and logistics support to safety and legal
(accident) investigations of the mishap. The host installation also provides storage and security
for investigation evidence, including wreckage, as directed. Upon release from legal hold, the
host installation disposes of evidence. The host installation normally has responsibility for initial
clean up of the accident site and any required follow-on environmental remediation or
restoration. In some circumstances, such as those where the mishap occurs in certain overseas
locations, host installation responsibilities may be assigned to an installation otherwise not
connected with the mishap to provide the required logistical and administrative support
necessary to conduct the investigation.
Illness and/or Disease—A non-traumatic physiological harm or loss of capacity produced by:
1) systematic, continued, or repeated stress or strain; or 2) exposure to toxins, poisons, fumes, or

does not meet the definition of injury.
Incident Commander—A trained and experienced responder who provides on-scene tactical
control using subject matter experts (SME) and support from other functionals. Normally,
Incident Commanders are SMEs from the Fire, Medical, or Security Forces response elements.
The Incident Commander uses the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) to manage
the incident. AFIMS is a methodology designed to incorporate the requirements of Homeland
Security Presidential Directive-5, the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and the
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                           101

installation may be a grouping of facilities, located in the same vicinity, which support particular
functions.
International Agreement—A multilateral or bilateral agreement, such as a base rights or access
agreement, a status of forces agreement (SOFA), including practices and standards established
pursuant to such agreement, or any other instrument defined as a binding international agreement
under DoD Directive 5530.3, International Agreements.
Joint Service Accident—A single mishap involving two or more military services of the DoD in
which one or more services experiences reportable injuries or damages.
Legal Investigation—An investigation of a DoD accident conducted for any purpose other than
accident prevention. A legal investigation inquires into the facts and circumstances surrounding
an accident, but does not focus on accident prevention. A legal investigation obtains and
preserves evidence for use in litigation, adjudication of tort claims, disciplinary actions, adverse
administrative actions, and all other purposes except accident prevention.

Privileged Safety Information— Privileged safety information refers to information that is
exempt by statute or case law from disclosure outside the Air Force safety community. The
military safety privilege is judicially recognized and protects the military investigative process.
The Air Force treats privileged safety information as confidential information to ensure
commanders quickly obtain accurate mishap information thereby promoting safety, combat
readiness, and mission accomplishment. Privileged information includes:
(1) Findings, conclusions, causes, recommendations, analysis, and the deliberative process of
safety investigators. Diagrams and exhibits if they contain information which depicts the
analysis of safety investigators. This includes draft versions of the above material.
(2) Information given to safety investigators pursuant to a promise of confidentiality.
(3) Computer generated animations, simulations, or simulator reenactments in which safety
investigator analysis is incorporated. Animations made exclusively from recorder data
(including Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance data) are not privileged.
(4) Photographs, imagery, and animations that reveal the deliberative process of the board,
including photographs with markings.
(5) Prior to AFI 91—204 September 2008, the SIB’s life sciences material, particularly 14-day
and 72-hour histories, were routinely privileged and contained analysis by a safety or life
sciences investigator. If histories are not labeled either ―privileged‖ or ―non-privileged‖ then the
GAIB legal advisor shall confirm with the SIB whether the histories are ―non-privileged‖ before
allowing other GAIB members access.
Property Damage—Damage to facilities, equipment, property, materiel, or resources. If the
occurrence meets mishap reporting criteria, then the cost of environmental cleanup shall be
included in property damage costs.
Radiological Accident—A loss of control over radioactive material or radiation presenting a
hazard to life, health, or property. See definition of ―reactor and radiological accident.‖
Reactor and Radiological Accident—Any accident involving fissile materiel used in a self-
supporting chain reaction (i.e., nuclear fission) to produce heat and/or radiation for both practical
application and research development.
Reactor System—A nuclear reactor with any associated nuclear or non-nuclear systems.
Recorder—A DoD military member or civilian employee that is familiar with administrative
procedures. A Recorder may be detailed to the GAIB to provide administrative assistance as
directed by the GAIB President. A paralegal may serve as Recorder.
Safety Investigation—An investigation of a DoD accident conducted solely to prevent
accidents. A safety investigation tries to determine why a mishap occurred and identify actions
that can be taken to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future. AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports, prescribes when and how to conduct an Air Force safety
investigation.
Senior Official—Senior Official is defined as any active or retired Regular Air Force, Air Force
Reserve, or Air National Guard military officer in grades O-7 (brigadier general) select and
above; Air National Guard Colonels with a Certificate of Eligibility (COE); current or former
AFI51-507 28 MAY 2010                                                                          105

authority, results in permanent total disability or permanent partial disability.
Site—Any single parcel of land, regardless of size, used and maintained by a DoD Component.
Statement of Opinion—A short written disclosure of the GAIB President’s personal opinion
regarding the cause, causes, and/or substantially contributing factors of the accident being

outside the scope of the accident investigation. A Statement of Opinion is prepared and included
in the GAIB Report only when specifically requested by the Convening Authority.

by a preponderance of evidence to have played an important role, directly or indirectly, in the
sequence of events.
Summary of Facts—A written statement of the relevant facts regarding the accident being
investigated. The Summary of Facts provides a thorough discussion of the facts in a narrative
style. It does not include conclusions or opinions about the cause, causes, and/or factors that
substantially contributed to the accident.
Tabs—Portion of the GAIB Report containing the documents and other evidence gathered by
the Accident Investigation Board and referenced in the Executive Summary and Summary of
Facts. GAIB Report Tabs are numbered consecutively from A to Z, and then they are numbered
