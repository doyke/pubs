1.1. Introduction. This instruction outlines the responsibilities for units conducting flying
training in AETC undergraduate and graduate pilot training courses in the T-1A, T-6A, and T-
38C aircraft. Each unit must institute procedures to ensure training, documentation, practices,
and procedures are accomplished IAW this instruction. This instruction complements AETCI
36-2205, Volume 1, Formal Flying Training Administration and Management.
1.2. Waivers. Policy and procedures are enacted to provide quality and consistency in training
and evaluation whether at an undergraduate or graduate level. Occasionally, unique
circumstances may warrant special consideration and possible waiver of policy provisions. At
the same time, because it is important to preserve fidelity of training, evaluation, and policy
implementation throughout the command, a process must be established for review of proposed
waivers.
   1.2.1. Waivers that change the intent of the policy outlined in this instruction are not
   authorized without AETC/A2/3/10 (T-2 waivers) approval. Unless otherwise stated in this
   document, Wing Commanders (CCs) (T-3 waivers) are the approval authority for individual
   personnel exceptions to the policy outlined in this instruction caused by special or unusual
   circumstances.
   1.2.2. AETC Units. Coordinate T-2 waivers through AETC/A3FP as appropriate.
   Squadron commanders (SQ/CCs) will submit all T-2 waiver requests through command
   channels in electronic format. Waiver requests must provide justification why the individual
   or unit cannot comply with requirements. AETC/A3FP and the units will file a copy of
   approved waivers to this volume according to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-360,
   Publications and Forms Management.
   1.2.3. Operations Group (OG) Commander.            The OG/CC of local supplements will
   handle waivers to unit supplemental guidance.

                                            Chapter 2

                                STUDENT ADMINISTRATION

2.1. Casual Student Officer Management:
     2.1.1. General. Casual student officers are those who have reported to their assigned
     specialized UPT (SUPT) or ENJJPT base and are awaiting training. AFPC/DPSIP uses a
     computer program to efficiently schedule casual student officers for initial flight screening
     (IFS) (if needed) and SUPT/ENJJPT and to minimize their “casual” time prior to entering the
     training pipeline.
     2.1.2. Roles and Responsibilities:
        2.1.2.1. The student squadron (STUS) manages all casual student officers. At ENJJPT,
        the operational support squadron (OSS) is responsible for casual student officer
        management. Note: For ENJJPT, substitute the corresponding OSS position as
        appropriate for all STUS references in this chapter. (T-2)
        2.1.2.2. Wings will not change any IFS or UPT training dates. (T-2) Each wing will
        develop a list of “hot spares,” primarily Officer Training School graduates, who have
        completed IFS. (T-2) The purpose of “hot spares” is to fill any SUPT training slot that
        may go unfilled as a result of higher than anticipated IFS attrition. If a student requires
        adjustment to the assigned training dates, the STUS supervisor will contact
        AFPC/DPSIPS at DSN 665-2102 for resolution.
        2.1.2.3. The STUS/CC or designated STUS supervisor will:
            2.1.2.3.1. Categorize casual student officers based on the time between their report
            date and their UPT class start date: short-term (90 calendar days or less) and long-
            term (more than 90 calendar days). Short-term casual student officers will normally
            stay in the operations group to ensure completion of all in-processing, temporary
            duties (TDY), and permanent change of station (PCS) requirements, and will only fill
            short-term or one-time manpower requirements. (T-3)
            2.1.2.3.2. Attempt to detail long-term casual student officers within the operations
            group. If a place in the group is not available, these officers may be detailed
            throughout the wing. (T-3)
            2.1.2.3.3. Relieve casual student officers from all details at least four calendar days
            prior to their UPT class start date. (T-3)
            2.1.2.3.4. Place UPT eliminees on casual status until they depart the base for a PCS.
            (T-2)
     2.1.3. Accountability. Casual student officers are valuable Air Force members, and the
     STUS must maintain accountability. The STUS/CC maintains administrative control
     (ADCON) over all casual student officers, regardless of the unit they support. (T-2) The
     STUS/CC will ensure casual student officers are ready to start scheduled training, provide
     continuing professional development, and motivate students for their flying careers.
     ADCON includes, but is not limited to, the following actions:
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                              9


     2.1.3.1. Disciplinary Action. The STUS/CC is the first level authority for all Uniform
     Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) actions.
        2.1.3.1.1. The STUS/CC will monitor each casual student officer’s performance from
        the date of arrival until departing the base for his or her follow-on assignment. (T-3)
        2.1.3.1.2. If prior to entry into UPT, a casual student officer's performance or
        conduct becomes questionable and the STUS/CC believes the student should be
        removed from the pilot training selection list for cause, the STUS/CC will notify
        AETC/A3FP. (T-2)
        2.1.3.1.3. The wing commander (WG/CC) will determine if a casual student officer
        should be removed from the pilot training selection list for “cause” based on the
        respective subordinate commander’s recommendation and the totality of the
        circumstances. (T-2) When the misconduct is serious enough to warrant discharge
        from service under AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for
        Commissioned Officers, the responsible AETC show-cause authority initiates
        discharge action. (T-1) Refer to AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, for
        additional administrative procedures. Notify AFPC/DPSIP using the procedure in
        AFI 36-2110, Assignments, paragraph 2.41.2, Officers Eliminated from Flying
        Training or Technical Training. (T-2) In addition, notify AETC/A3RA and
        AETC/A3FP.
     2.1.3.2. Recalls. Casual student officers will report to their STUS supervisor according
     to the recall option for accountability and sign-in prior to reporting to their duty
     assignment. (T-3)
     2.1.3.3. Duty Hours. Casual student officer duty supervisors are responsible for
     maintaining accountability of the casual student officers during all duty periods. (T-3)
     2.1.3.4. Mentoring. All casual student officers will be present for mentoring sessions
     set by their STUS supervisor, as required. Students will be released back to their duty
     assignments upon completion. (T-3)
     2.1.3.5. Mishap Reporting. Casual student officer duty supervisors will notify the
     STUS supervisor of any on- or off-duty mishap. (T-3) If the duty supervisor completes
     an AETC Form 435, Mishap Data Worksheet, route it through the STUS supervisor and
     the STUS/CC. (T-3)
     2.1.3.6. Squadron Commander Calls/Safety Meetings. Release casual student officers
     to attend all STUS/CC calls and safety meetings unless their duty is mission critical and
     their absence is coordinated with their STUS supervisor. (T-3)
     2.1.3.7. Letter of Evaluation (LOE). Duty supervisors of casual student officers are
     highly encouraged to complete an optional LOE, which is the appropriate tool to capture
     a casual student officer’s performance. While the optional LOE is not filed in the
     selection record, it provides performance information to the subsequent rater for
     consideration when accomplishing the follow-on report (training or evaluation report).
     Officers may include their LOE in a letter to the board (for example, central selection
     board, force-shaping board, etc.), if convened prior to their next evaluation. In addition
     to LOEs, excellent performance can be documented with a decoration that will become a
 10                                                      AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014


       part of the selection record. By completing optional LOEs, a level playing field is
       maintained among all students, regardless of casual status duties. LOEs and decorations
       will be routed through the STUS supervisor for STUS/CC recommendation and approval.
       (T-3)
       2.1.3.8. Leave. Casual student officers will coordinate leave and pass requests through
       their duty supervisor prior to submitting them to their STUS supervisor for approval. (T-
       3)
       2.1.3.9. Physical Training (PT). Casual student officers will participate in the STUS
       fitness program. (T-3)
       2.1.3.10. Supervisors. The SUPT T-6A class commander or T-6A ENJJPT military
       training officer (MTO) assumes supervisory responsibility for the students during the
       Primary Phase of UPT. (T-2) The SUPT T-38C/T-1A class commander or T-38C
       ENJJPT MTO assumes supervisory responsibility during the Advanced Phase of UPT.
       (T-2) The STUS will supervise UPT eliminees until they PCS from the base. (T-3)
       During each transfer of supervisory responsibilities, the losing supervisor will brief the
       gaining supervisor on each student’s progress, potential, and any problems affecting the
       student’s training. (T-3)
2.2. Course Entry Administration. Units will review incoming student records to verify they
are complete. (T-2) Students must meet course entry prerequisites established in the syllabus.
(T-2) If a student does not meet the course entry prerequisites, contact AETC/A3FP before
entering the student into training. (T-2) As a minimum, units will review the following student
records (or their equivalents) prior to any formal training:
   2.2.1. Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Records. These records are maintained in
   the flight evaluation folder (FEF). Depending on aircrew specialty, some individuals may
   not yet possess an FEF. Students should hand-carry FEFs to training according to the
   education and training course announcements (ETCA) course requirements. If required,
   flying training units forward applicable AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, and
   other stan/eval records and documents to the student’s home or gaining unit upon completion
   of training.
   2.2.2. Training Folders or Records from Previous Courses (Pipeline students only).
   Pipeline students are those students who have not yet transferred PCS to an operational unit
   as permanent party members. If training records are not available, contact AETC/A3FP.
   2.2.3. Training Summaries (AETC Form 1122 Series) and Student Biographies. The
   SQ/CC, squadron operations officer (SQ/DO), flight commander (FLT/CC), or designated
   representative should review all training summaries and student biographies included in the
   student training record.
2.3. Quota Management. The programmed flying training (PFT) document establishes the
baseline for student quota management, which reflects real-time changes and are the AETC
aircrew training primary source documents for class entry dates, student load, and production
schedule information. AETC/A3RA maintains the quota management worksheets. These
worksheets are available at https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AE-57/default.aspx. AETC
provides class quotas annually via electronic PFT pages. AETC/A3RA notifies affected units
when quotas change.
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                                 11


   2.3.1. Units should obtain class entry rosters from the Military Personnel Data System
   Oracle Training Administration (OTA) or the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources
   System before class entry. (T-2) Obtain rosters as early as possible to allow identification of
   excess capacity. Contact AETC/A3RA and AFPC/DPPAO to fill excess capacity if
   identified with adequate lead time.
   2.3.2. Units will report roster discrepancies as soon as they are discovered but no later than
   three duty days following the class start date. (T-2) Report changes, discrepancies, and
   graduation delays to AETC/A3RA, AFPC/DPPAO and AETC/A3FP. (T-2) In addition,
   report graduation delays and changes impacting track/aircraft assignment to AFPC/DPAOT.
   (T-2)
2.4. Production Metrics Report. AETC/A3RB is the point of contact (POC) for flying training
production metrics. At the beginning of each fiscal year, AETC/A3RB uploads the PFT
document to the flying training production analysis (FTPA) web-based input tool. (T-2) The
OG/CC or designated POC will update the FTPA with actual entries, gains, losses, attritions,
graduate numbers and notes, if applicable. (T-2) For SUPT only, class demographics for entries,
graduates, and attritions are required for each phase. (T-2) These updates are due five duty days
after the class start date and class graduation date. (T-2)
2.5. Courseware Availability. Students may access courseware material for SUPT and Pilot
Instructor Training (PIT) at https://uftcourseware.randolph.af.mil/dlp/Default.aspx. (T-2)
2.6. Undergraduate Flight Training (UFT) Academic Integrity Standards: At the beginning
of the Preflight Phase and before any academic testing, STUS/CC will brief students on AETC’s
Academic Integrity standards found in AETCI 36-2909, Recruiting, Education, and Training
Standards of Conduct. (T-2) Student will then sign AETC’s UFT Academic Integrity Standards
document. (T-2) The document can be downloaded from the AETC Bookstore, “General Pubs”
tab at: https://trss3.randolph.af.mil/bookstore/home/homePage.aspx. Once signed, scan the
document and place it in student’s training folder. (T-2)      Note: Local bookstores may
maintain copies of the Undergraduate Flight Training Academic Integrity Standards document to
facilitate this requirement.
2.7. Academic Training Scheduling. Do not schedule UPT students for more than six hours
per day of testable classroom and/or computer-assisted instruction for academic subjects. (T-2)
Do not schedule graduate students for more than eight hours per day. (T-2) Examinations are
considered testable material. If students elect, they may accomplish computer-assisted
instruction/self-study beyond the maximum scheduled hours. (T-3)
2.8. Special Reporting Procedures for ANG and AFRC Students. SQ/CCs will ensure the
following actions are taken:
   2.8.1. For ANG or AFRC Students Experiencing Difficulty:
       2.8.1.1. Units will notify AETC/A3G (for ANG) or AETC/A3H (for AFRC), as
       appropriate, via E-mail when an ANG or AFRC student requires a progress check (PC) or
       an elimination check (EC), enters the commander’s review (CR) process, is placed on
       administrative hold, or is eliminated from or reinstated in training. (T-2) In addition,
       notify       AETC/A3G          (aetc.a3gworkflow@us.af.mil)            or       AETC/A3H
       (aetc.a3hworkflow@us.af.mil), as appropriate, when a student washes back a class or
       there is reasonable doubt about a student’s potential to complete a training syllabus. (T-2)
 12                                                      AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014


      Include the student’s home unit and National Guard Bureau (NGB)/A3O or NGB/A3OC,
      or AFRC/A3TB, as applicable, as addressees on the E-mails.
      2.8.1.2. Students experiencing difficulty may include those assigned to a fighter unit who
      lack the potential to complete follow-on fighter training. Under these circumstances,
      refer to paragraph 2.8.2 for the administrative review process.
   2.8.2. For ANG and AFRC SUPT Fighter-Bound Students.
      2.8.2.1. The OG/CC, SQ/CC, FLT/CC, and ENJJPT MTO will review an ANG or AFRC
      student’s training if the student falls to the bottom half of the class within five weeks of
      track select (Primary Phase) or any time the student lacks the potential to complete
      follow-on training (Primary or Advanced Phase). (T-2)
      2.8.2.2. If the review determines the student lacks the potential to complete follow-on
      training, the OG/CC will inform the student’s home unit, AETC/A3R, AETC/A3F,
      AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, and NGB/A3O and NGB/A3OC or AFRC/A1 and AFRC/A3
      by E-mail. (T-2) NGB/A3O or AFRC/A3 then must make one of the following
      decisions: (1) continue training; (2) request a change from AETC/A3RA (prior to the
      start of the Advanced Phase) to a track other than T-38Cs, and continue training with a
      change in assignment to a non-fighter unit if the training change request is approved; or
      (3) remove the student from training. Once a decision is made, NGB/A3O or AFRC/A3
      will pass the decision on to AETC/A3R, AETC/A3F, AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H. If the
      student’s track is changed, NGB/A3OC or AFRC/A3TB will notify AETC/A3RA. (T-2)
      AETC/A3RA will notify the base via the track-select process.
   2.8.3. Graduation Notification. If the PFT graduation dates changes, units will notify the
   student’s home unit and NGB/A3OC or AFRC/A3TB of the student’s new graduation date
   by E-mail no later than 30 calendar days before the new date. (T-2) When it appears a
   student may graduate late, notify the student’s home unit as soon as possible. Send an
   information copy to AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as appropriate.
2.9. Physical Training (PT) Program. Students participate in a scheduled PT program
according to the appropriate syllabus; AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program; AETCI 11-406, Fighter
Aircrew Conditioning Program (FACP); and AFPAM 11-419, G-Awareness for Aircrew. (T-1)
   2.9.1. U.S. Air Force (USAF) UPT students require a current passing (Satisfactory or
   Excellent) FA to advance to the Primary Phase. If students do not have a passing FA by the
   completion of the Preflight Phase, STUS/CC will:
      2.9.1.1. Remove them from training and place on administrative hold status until passing
      the FA. (T-2)
      2.9.1.2. Notify AETC/A3FP (reference paragraph 2.11.2). (T-2)
      2.9.1.3. Enter them into the CR process and notify AETC/A3FP if they do not passed the
      FA after the 90-day reconditioning period. (T-2)
   2.9.2. Group (flight, class, etc.) physical training is highly encouraged to build esprit de
   corps, but it is not required.
   2.9.3. All students (including those at ENJJPT) must have a current FA with a passing score
   to attend survival, evasion, resistance, and escape training after graduation from UPT. (T-2)
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                                  13


2.10. Weight-for-Flight Standards. AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards,
establishes weight-for-flight standards for flying in ejection-seat aircraft. Prior to their first
flight, units will brief students on the capabilities and limitations of the ejection seats in their
unit’s aircraft. (T-2) TDY-to-school funded candidates failing to meet these standards upon
arrival at training will result in training cancellation and members will be returned to their
previous base. (T-3) Undergraduate students in training who are outside the weight-for-flight
range are given until they reach the flight line to get their weight into the proper range. (T-2)
Enter UPT students who do not meet the weight for flight standards into the CR process and
notify AETC/A3FP (reference paragraph 2.11.2). (T-2) Comply with AFI 48-123 for graduate
students. (T-1)
2.11. Administrative Hold. Units will place students whose training has been suspended for
other than medical reasons for more than seven calendar days on administrative hold. (T-2)
Students on administrative hold are removed from training and will not attend flightline activities
or participate in any training. (T-2) Units should use administrative hold judiciously for
extenuating circumstances, to include family serious illness or death, or other personal problems
beyond the individual’s control. Units will notify the host aviation resource management
(HARM) office and the registrar of all administrative hold actions. (T-2) The registrar will
update the student’s status in OTA (if required) to reflect the student status codes. (T-2) Refer to
AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, for administrative hold procedures for temporary medical
disqualifications.
   2.11.1. Unit will notify AETC/A3FP (AETC.A3FP@us.af.mil) when:
       2.11.1.1. UPT or PCS-to-training graduate students are on administrative hold for more
       than 30 calendar days, or may reach this threshold (reference paragraph 2.12.2). (T-2)
       2.11.1.2. TDY-to-school funded students have a training delay over seven calendar days
       (reference paragraph 2.12.3). (T-2)
       2.11.1.3. UPT students are on administrative hold for centrifuge training failure
       (reference paragraph 5.5). (T-2)
       2.11.1.4. Primary Phase UPT students are on administrative hold for an FA failure
       (reference paragraph 2.9.1). (T-2)
       2.11.1.5. Advanced Phase UPT students are on administrative hold for failing to pass
       their FA by their class graduation date (reference paragraph 2.9.2). (T-2)
       2.11.1.6. Students are on administrative hold for medical reasons. (T-2)
   2.11.2. AETC/A3FP notification will include:
       2.11.2.1. Student’s name (last, first, middle initial) (T-2)
       2.11.2.2. Current class and scheduled course completion/graduation date (T-2)
       2.11.2.3. Date placed on hold and reason for training delay (T-2)
       2.11.2.4. Expected return to training date (Update AETC/A3FP if this date changes.) (T-
       2) Note: If sending Privacy Act (PA)/Personally Identifiable Information (PII) via E-
       mail, mark “For Official Use Only (FOUO)” and digitally encrypt the E-mail).

2.12. Training Delay:
   2.12.1. Medical. UPT students requiring extended medical treatment beyond their assigned
   UPT class start date will be administratively entered into training and placed into a duty not
   including flying (DNIF) status on the class start date. (T-2) Adhere to timelines for student
   administrative hold and medical extensions according to AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1.
   2.12.2. PCS-to-Training Students. If students are on administrative hold for more than 30
   calendar days, or may reach this threshold, the assigned unit will notify AETC/A3FP
   (reference paragraph 2.11.2). (T-2) Suspension of the student’s aeronautical orders and (or) a
   CR may be warranted for students who spend extended time on administrative hold. Refer to
   the applicable syllabus for students returning to training.
   2.12.3. TDY-to-School Funded Students. The assigned training unit will notify
   AETC/A3FP and AETC/FMAM of any student training delays over seven calendar days and
   ensure the student’s orders are amended (reference paragraph 2.11.2). (T-2) AETC/A3FP
   will in turn notify AETC/A3R.
2.13. Students in Transition Status. Commanders will assign students awaiting PCS training,
eliminees, administrative hold, etc., to duties commensurate with their background, training, and
grade. (T-3) Contact AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H for the disposition of ANG and AFRC
students. (T-3)

                                     TRAINING FOLDER

3.1. Introduction:
   3.1.1. Each student will have a training folder. (T-2) The training folder will consist of the
   electronic TIMS/GTIMS training folder and other required training documents not
   maintained in TIMS/GTIMS. (T-2) If a backup version of the TIMS/GTIMS training folder
   is maintained, the unit will address procedures in local unit guidance. (T-2) Units will ensure
   students only have access their own training folder. (T-2)
   3.1.2. In addition to the training folder, the FLT/CC will maintain personal information
   folders (if required) on students to protect information of a personal nature, inappropriate for
   public access, or sensitive in nature, and thus not appropriate for the training folder. (T-2)
   Use AF Form 174, Record of Individual Counseling or AETC Form 173, Student Record of
   Academic/Nonacademic Counseling and Comments, to record counseling entries maintained
   in the personal information folder. (T-2) Annotate on an AF Form 4293, Student Activity
   Record, in the student’s training folder when a counseling session is conducted. (T-2)
   3.1.3. The FLT/CC will ensure training folders and personal information folders are secured
   to prevent unauthorized access. (T-2)

       continuity from one instructor pilot (IP) to the next and alerts IPs to the areas and
       objectives they should concentrate on for the ensuing sortie. (T-2)
           3.2.4.1.1. As a minimum, provide comments for any maneuver graded below the
           previous unit maneuver item file (MIF) proficiency level. (T-2) For graduate pilot
           training courses, postflight comments are required only on items graded below the
           previous unit MIF, if in the instructor’s judgment the student may have difficulty
           meeting MIF by the end of the unit. (T-3) Ensure comments are consistent with

           weak areas that need to be highlighted. (T-2) Consolidate comments in the “Overall
           Comments” section under the “Comments” tab. Comments will follow the cause-
           and-effect format to document the substandard performance and identify the root
           cause. (T-2) Each MIF item will be addressed separately. (T-2) Do not use a MIF
           item to justify a downgrade of other MIF item(s) without a corresponding down grade
           of the first MIF item. (T-2) Do not bundle multiple MIF items under a single MIF
           item. (T-2).
           3.2.4.1.3. Units may use the AF Form 4293 instead of the grade-sheet to document
           substandard performance outlined in paragraph 3.2.4.1.2. The OG/CC will ensure the
           documentation methodology is standardized in each MDS. (T-2)
       3.2.4.2. As a minimum, in the “Overall Comments” section under the “Comments” tab,
       instructors will include the mission profile, overall assessment of the student’s

       formation in the “Overall Comments” section under the “Comments” tab. (T-2) Do not
       put the IP’s name on the grade sheet. (T-2)
       3.2.4.4. Log all student-flown landings, patterns, and approaches on each ATD and
       aircraft event. (Note: The résumé should reflect all landings, patterns, and approaches
       accomplished by the student.) (T-2)
       3.2.4.5. Grade sheet Review. Document grade sheet reviews in the “Grade sheet
       Reviews” section under the “Docs” tab. A formal review is required by the student and
       next IP on all grade sheets. (T-2) In addition:
           3.2.4.5.1. If the lesson is incomplete, the approval authority for the incomplete sortie
           will indicate approval by documenting a formal review. (T-2)
           3.2.4.5.2. If the overall lesson graded is fair (F) or unsatisfactory (U), the student’s
           FLT/CC and assigned IP will review the grade sheet and document the formal review.

                                          Chapter 4

                                STUDENT MANAGEMENT

4.1. CAP. Reference AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, for CAP category definitions and additional
guidance.
   4.1.1. Squadron Commander Responsibilities. During the Preflight Phase of UPT, the
   STUS/CC will administer CAP. (T-2) For graduate level courses and once a UPT student
   begins flight line training, the flying training SQ/CC will administer the program. (T-2) The
   day-to-day CAP administration may be delegated to the SQ/DO, squadron assistant
   operations officer (SQ/ADO), FLT/CC, flight supervisor, or designated student training
   manager, but the SQ/CC maintains overall authority and responsibility. (T-2) The STUS/CC
   may retain administrative authority of academic and military CAP during the Primary and
   Advanced Phases of UPT if specifically authorized in local guidance. Class commanders
   may place students on military CAP if specifically authorized in local guidance. Note: For
   ENJJPT, substitute the corresponding OSS position for all STUS references in this chapter.
   4.1.2. Local Guidance. Units will develop specific CAP guidance as it relates to the unit’s
   mission. (T-2) As a minimum, this guidance will address criteria for different CAP
   categories, student or training activity restrictions, instructor continuity requirements,
   placement procedures, and removal procedures. (T-2)
   4.1.3. CAP Procedures. The FLT/CC, SQ/CC or MTO places the student on CAP and
   removes the student from CAP when sustained normal progress is demonstrated or when
   personal issues are resolved. (T-2) The SQ/CC will be briefed prior to removing a student
   from CAP. (T-2) A student requiring an extended period of increased supervision or
   repeated placement on CAP should be considered for a PC or EC.
4.2. Progress Checks and Elimination Checks. PCs/ECs are full mission-profile sorties
during which a student’s performance is observed, rated potential is evaluated, and ability to
complete the course within syllabus constraints is considered. (T-2) Conduct PCs/ECs according
to the applicable syllabus. (T-2) PCs/ECs are separate from the normal syllabus flow. Students
must demonstrate proficiency on the PC/EC to the current stage of training. PCs/ECs are key
events in the CR process. Triggers for these events are defined in the applicable syllabus.
   4.2.1. Authorized PC/EC pilots. Only duly appointed and qualified instructor pilots will
   administer a PC/EC. (T-2) Refer to the applicable syllabus for authorized PC/EC pilots.
   Normally do not fly the student with the same PC/EC pilot on consecutive and/or subsequent
   PC/EC sorties.
   4.2.2. Ground Evaluation. PC/EC ground evaluations may be conducted as a result of a
   failed category check/PC/EC for unsatisfactory general knowledge, ground operations,
   mission planning or EPs, or as the result of a FLT/CC-directed evaluation for failure to
   progress or meet syllabus standards in procedural knowledge. (These evaluations may
   include a simulator mission.)
       4.2.2.1. The designated PC/EC instructor will conduct the entire briefing, ground
       evaluation execution, debriefing, and assign the overall grade. (T-2)
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                                23


      4.2.2.2. The ground evaluation should be one to two hours in length and of sufficient
      breadth and depth to evaluate the student’s overall procedural knowledge.
   4.2.3. Simulator:
      4.2.3.1. During PCs/ECs, civilian simulator instructors (CSI) will serve only as console
      operators. (T-2) Their participation is limited to assisting the PC/EC instructor with
      operating the simulator to facilitate mission execution.
      4.2.3.2. The PC/EC instructor will brief the assigned CSI separately on mission
      objectives, mission profile, event flow, desired scenarios, and areas of student weakness.
      (T-2) The actual student mission briefing, execution, debriefing, assignment of
      individual grades, and assessment of overall student performance is the sole
      responsibility of the designated PC/EC instructor. (T-2)
      4.2.3.3. The PC/EC instructor will not substitute a simulator PC/EC for a syllabus-
      directed aircraft sortie. (T-2)
      4.2.3.4. Simulators provide valuable training to prepare students for actual aircraft
      missions; however, consider a student for an aircraft PC when he or she is identified by
      repeated failures or lack of progress in an instrument simulator. If a student progresses to
      an EC in an instrument simulator unit, the EC should be accomplished in the aircraft
      (other than general knowledge or procedural issues best handled by an EC ground
      evaluation or emergency procedure simulator). (T-3) A student should not be eliminated
      in an instrument simulator training unit if he or she has not flown an instrument aircraft
      sortie. (T-3)
   4.2.4. Grading. Grade PCs/ECs according to syllabus guidance. (T-2)
   4.2.5. Incomplete PC/EC. The PC/EC pilot determines if the sortie is complete. (T-2) A
   PC/EC is “Incomplete” only if the mission tasks and objectives could not be completed to
   ascertain a reasonable evaluation of student performance. (T-2)
   4.2.6. Continuation Training (CT) Meetings. The SQ/CC or designated PC/EC pilot will
   conduct PC/EC pilot CT meetings at least quarterly to ensure command and squadron PC/EC
   philosophy is implemented and standardized. (T-2) All individuals who conduct PCs/ECs
   are required to attend. (T-2) Document the meetings in enough detail to allow those who
   were unable to attend to read, initial the meeting minutes, and understand what transpired.
   (T-2) Maintain copies of the meetings minutes and slides (if used) for one year. (T-2) As a
   minimum, each meeting should include a review of pass and fail rates by individual PC/EC
   instructors over the last quarter and year-to-date, quarterly and annual PC/EC pass and fail
   rates by category, and at least one grading scenario brought to a conclusion. (T-2) Grading
   scenarios should generate thoughtful discussion and reference to the individual CTS
   appropriate for the scenario. Document the final recommended grade for each grading
   scenario in the CT minutes/slides. (T-2)
4.3. Commander’s Review Process:
   4.3.1. Overview. The CR recommends the student’s elimination or retention in training.
   All students in a formal flying training course will go through a CR before being eliminated
   or withdrawn from training. (T-2) Complete the CR process within 10 duty days (24 duty
   days for international students) from the date the initiating authority (IA) signs the AETC
24                                                      AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014


  Form 139, Record of Commander’s Review Action (Undergraduate Pilot Training) or AETC
  Form 140, Record of Commander’s Review Action (Graduate Pilot Training) as appropriate.
  (T-2) Exception: ENJJPT uses a training review board, as required, to manage students not
  meeting normal syllabus progress. (Refer to the appropriate ENJJPT syllabuses for specific
  guidelines.)
  4.3.2. Entry. The IA will enter the student in the CR process NLT three duty days after
  meeting the syllabus trigger. (T-2) Remove the student from training and place on
  administrative hold pending final approving authority (AA) decision. (T-2) The IA may elect
  to continue the student in academic training with reviewing authority (RA) concurrence. (T-
  2) Instruct UPT students not to attend flight line activities (aircraft or simulator) until
  reinstated. (T-2) Students projected to exceed the syllabus maximum sortie or flying hour
  threshold because of overall poor performance should be considered for entry into the CR
  process under the failure to progress or meet syllabus standards trigger. If the syllabus does
  not identify a maximum threshold, use 115 percent as a guide. UPT students failing three
  category checks or a combination of four category checks, PCs and (or) ECs during the same
  phase of training should be considered for a CR under the failure to progress or meet syllabus
  standards trigger.
  4.3.3. IA. During the Preflight Phase, the STUS/CC is the IA. (T-2) During the Primary
  and Advanced Phases, the SQ/CC conducting the student’s syllabus training is the IA. (T-2)
  For graduate courses, the SQ/CC conducting the student’s syllabus training is the IA. (T-2)
  The IA will:
     4.3.3.1. Notify the student in writing of his or her consideration for elimination and brief
     the student on the CR process (Figure 4.1). (T-2) For international students, also notify
     the local base IMSO. (T-2) For ANG and AFRC students, refer to paragraph 2.8.1.1.
     4.3.3.2. Complete the IA portion of the Commander’s Review Checklist and Briefing
     Guide (Figure 4.2). (T-2)
  4.3.4. RA. The OG/CC is the RA. (T-2) The RA will:
     4.3.4.1. Review the student’s training and recommends elimination from or retention in
     training. (T-2) The OG/CC may delegate this authority to the deputy operations group
     commander (OG/CD), operations support SQ/CC, or any flying training SQ/CC (not to
     include the student’s SQ/CC). The RA will examine the student’s training records and,
     as deemed necessary, interview the student and FLT/CC or SQ/CC.
     4.3.4.2. Complete the RA portion of the CR Checklist (Figure 4.2). (T-2)
     4.3.4.3. Suspend the CR if it becomes apparent that circumstances require convening an
     investigation under the provisions of AFI 51-602 or when information arises that would
     cause the student to be medically disqualified. (T-1) Reconvene as appropriate to
     complete the CR process.
  4.3.5. AA. The WG/CC is the AA. (T-2) The AA will:
     4.3.5.1. Complete the AA portion of the CR Checklist (Figure 4.2). (T-2)
     4.3.5.2. List any authorized AT on AETC Form 139 or AETC Form 140, as applicable.
     (T-2)
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                         25


     4.3.5.3. Not recommend UPT eliminees for entry into any other SUPT or ENJJPT
     training. (T-2) The AA will not recommend students eliminated for academic deficiency,
     manifestation of apprehension (MOA) or drop on request (DOR) for any other flying
     training. (T-2) AA may recommend UPT students eliminated for other reason (e.g.,
     airsickness, g-tolerance, fly training deficiency) for undergraduate remotely piloted
     aircraft (RPA) training (URT) provided they still meet required medical standards. The
     AA should consider the student’s motivation, situational awareness, task/mission
     management skills, pilot in command skills, and overall airmanship when making URT
     recommendations. Note: A UPT student with an aeronautical rating cannot DOR and
     falls under the procedures in AFI 11-402.

4.4. Student Eliminations:
   4.4.1. Students should be eliminated if they:
      4.4.1.1. Exhibit lack of adaptability (LOA), which is the inability to complete the course
      because of physical, psychological, or personality factors. LOA eliminees require an
      evaluation from both medical and rated personnel. (T-2) This category includes
      airsickness, GLOC, and MOA. Medical and rated personnel conducting the evaluations
      will document the results in the student’s training folder. (T-2) They will specify the
      physical, psychological, or personality factors that led to the LOA determination. (T-2)
      In addition, they will annotate specific deficiencies in Section IV of AETC Form 139 or
      AETC Form 140. (T-2)
      4.4.1.2. Fail to meet proficiency standards of the syllabus in flying, academics, or
      procedures.
      4.4.1.3. Fail to demonstrate the potential to complete the course within syllabus
      constraints.
      4.4.1.4. Receive punitive action under the articles of the UCMJ.
      4.4.1.5. Fail to meet fitness standards prescribed in AFI 36-2905 and this publication.
   4.4.2. Students will be eliminated if they:
      4.4.2.1. DOR (UPT only). (T-2) The FLT/CC will counsel the student on the
      ramifications of DOR (i.e., permanent disqualification from flying status and possible
      reclassification proceeding) prior to entering him or her into a CR. (T-2) Once the
      student is counseled and signs the AETC Form 139, he or she is ineligible for
      reinstatement. (T-2) Note: UPT students with aeronautical rating cannot DOR.
      4.4.2.2. Attempt to DOR (rated aircrew members). (T-2) Rated officers attempting to
      DOR from a formal training course fall under the provisions in AFI 11-402 and will be
      removed from the formal training course via a CR prior to implementing AFI 11-402
      procedures. (T-2) Note: Attempting to DOR will trigger an FEB which opens the
      member to permanent disqualification from aviation service and may prohibit wearing
      the aviation badge.
      4.4.2.3. Become medically disqualified, unless a flight surgeon determines the
      disqualification may resolve within 12 months of the initial disqualification. (T-2) In the
      latter instance, place the student in administrative hold status. Refer to AFI 48-123,
      AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, and Chapter 5 of this publication for additional guidance.
      Note: For those students funded under the TDY-to-school program, the assigned unit
      will notify AETC/A3FP and AETC/FMAM as soon as the administrative hold status
      becomes probable.
      4.4.2.4. Initiate action to separate from the service. (T-2)
      4.4.2.5. Get recalled by the parent unit, higher headquarters, or home country. (T-2)
      Note: Units will not allow students to be recalled without prior coordination with
      AETC/A3F. (T-2)
      4.4.2.6. Get involved in drug abuse substantiated by reliable evidence. (T-2)
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                               29


       4.4.2.7. Get adjudicated absent without leave, are confined, or have deserted. (T-2)
       4.4.2.8. Become hospitalized for an extended period (as determined by the WG/CC).
       Student may be considered for reinstatement at a later date. (T-2)
       4.4.2.9. Demonstrate improper attitude or lack of responsibility toward assigned duties or
       obligations. (T-3) This may include character disorders that raise doubt about the
       student’s fitness for training.
       4.4.2.10. Fail two ECs in the same phase (Primary or Advanced) or fail three ECs total
       (applies only to UPT). (T-3)
   4.4.3. If a student meets misconduct or non-judicial punishment criteria outlined IAW
   AETC/CC policy memorandums for officer standards while enrolled in UPT, based on the
   totality of the circumstances, the respective subordinate commander will recommend whether
   an officer should be eliminated from training. (T-2) When the misconduct is serious enough
   to warrant discharge from service under AFI 36-3206, the responsible AETC Show-Cause
   Authority will initiate discharge action. (T-1) In the absence of other guidance,
   AETC/A2/3/10 will make recommendations to AFPC concerning reclassification and
   discharge of these officers. When completing AETC Form 139 or AETC Form 140:
       4.4.3.1. The OG/CC is the IA.
       4.4.3.2. The WG/CC is the RA.
       4.4.3.3. A2/3/10 is the AA.
   4.4.4. AETC/A3 staff will maintain entry, production and elimination data to ensure fairness
   and equitable opportunity for all flying training program candidates.
4.5. Student Dispositions:
   4.5.1. Students reinstated into training after a CR will complete a PC or EC (as appropriate)
   following completion of any AT authorized by the AA in Section IV of AETC Form 139 or
   AETC Form 140. (T-2) Students reinstated after academic deficiencies must repeat the
   examination after appropriate AT. (T-2) Students reinstated following a flight evaluation
   board will complete AT directed by the final approval authority. (T-2)
   4.5.2. After completing AETC Form 139 or AETC Form 140, Section IV, units will process
   eliminated students under AFI 36-3206, AFI 36-3207; AFI 36-2110, or the ETCA. (T-1)
   Units will process international students according to AFI 16-105; rated pilots and UPT
   students with an aeronautical rating according to AFI 11-402; and pipeline or PCS students
   through appropriate personnel channels. (T-1)
4.6. CR Records Distribution:
   4.6.1. The school registrar or similarly designated authority will maintain original CR
   records according to the RDS and distribute them within 10 duty days of CR completion. (T-
   2) These records must be available for review. (T-2)
   4.6.2. Units will distribute eliminated officers’ CR records as outlined in Table 4.1 and
   maintain them according to the RDS. (T-2)
   4.6.3. The course registrar will ensure each elimination case is updated in the training
   management database with an elimination code. (T-2)
 30                                                    AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014


   4.6.4. The servicing flight management office will update ARMS with the appropriate
   disqualification code. (T-2)

                      MEDICAL MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

5.1. General. This chapter establishes student management requirements for appropriate
medical and operations personnel. Operations and medical personnel must ensure commanders
are informed when students exhibit MOA symptoms or other medical conditions that affect daily
student training decisions. Supervisors must also strive to keep students motivated and flying on
a regular basis. AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, contains additional guidance.
5.2. Airsickness Procedures for UPT Students:
   5.2.1. Students must meet MIF standards to continue flight training. Early in the Primary
   Phase of UPT, the instructor may help students overcome the impacts of airsickness by
   changing the profile, momentarily taking control of the aircraft, or if necessary, terminating
   the mission when airsickness symptoms persist. Use sortie termination as a last resort since
   continued exposure to the flight environment enhances physiological adaptation. As students
   progress in training, instructor assistance decreases. During the last five sorties preceding
   initial solo in the Primary Phase, instructors may offer only minimal assistance.
   5.2.2. FLT/CCs and instructors will send students who experience active or passive
   airsickness to the flight surgeon for examination, counseling, and treatment as soon as
   practical and before the next aircraft or simulator sortie. (T-2) Document all episodes of
   airsickness on AF Form 4293. (T-2)
   5.2.3. While participating in the airsickness management program (AMP), students will
   continue the normal syllabus flow to include flying. (T-3) AMP is outlined AETCI 48-102,
   Medical Management of Undergraduate Flying Training Students.
   5.2.4. The FLT/CC will place Primary Phase students who become airsick on four or more
   presolo sorties on CAP. (T-2)
   5.2.5. During any of the last five sorties preceding the initial solo or on any post solo sortie,
   instructors will grade Primary Phase students as unsatisfactory overall when they develop
   airsickness resulting in (1) IP intervention, (2) relinquishing aircraft control, or (3) premature
   sortie termination. (T-2) In addition, students who become airsick during any of the last five
   sorties preceding the initial T-6A solo sortie must receive SQ/CC approval before flying an
   initial solo or be entered into the CR process. (T-2) Document SQ/CC approval on an AF
   Form 4293. (T-2)
   5.2.6. Instructors will grade Advanced Phase students who occupy any pilot or copilot
   position and develop airsickness on any sortie as unsatisfactory overall. (T-2) Students who
   experience airsickness while not occupying a pilot seat with access to flight controls (jump
   seat, passenger seat, etc.) may not necessarily warrant an overall grade of unsatisfactory. In
   this case, consider the inflight conditions, training accomplished, and whether or not the
   mission is terminated early to determine the final grade.
   5.2.7. Limit student pharmacological therapy to a maximum of three sorties. (T-2) IAW
   AETCI 48-102, the use of medication to treat airsickness is prohibited beginning five sorties
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                                  33


   prior to the initial T-6A solo sortie and remains so until graduation from the Advanced Phase
   of UPT. (T-2)
   5.2.8. Following any airsickness episode, the student’s next flight must be with an IP. (T-2)
   5.2.9. After the third post-solo airsickness and every third episode thereafter, the SQ/CC will
   assess the student’s potential to complete training. (T-2) If the student’s potential to graduate
   is high, the SQ/CC will make an entry on the AF Form 4293 to continue the student in
   training. (T-2) If the student’s potential to graduate is low, the CR process will determine
   whether the student is retained in or eliminated from training. (T-3) Refer to AETCI 48-102
   and AFI 48-123 for more guidance on airsickness.
   5.2.10. Commanders will process rated officers in UPT who cannot overcome airsickness
   problems according to AFI 48-123. (T-1) Squadron supervisors should coordinate closely
   with the chief of aeromedical services for each of these special cases.
5.3. Airsickness Procedures for Graduate Pilot Training Students:
   5.3.1. A student who experiences airsickness while not occupying a pilot seat with access to
   flight controls (jump seat, passenger seat, etc.) may not necessarily warrant an overall grade
   of unsatisfactory. In this case, instructors should consider the inflight conditions, training
   accomplished, and whether or not the mission is terminated early to determine the final
   grade. They will use the applicable syllabus to grade students who occupy any pilot or
   copilot position and develop airsickness.
   5.3.2. Students must meet MIF standards to continue flight training. (T-2)
   5.3.3. FLT/CCs and instructors will send students who experience active or passive
   airsickness to the flight surgeon for examination, counseling, and treatment as soon as
   practical and before the next aircraft or simulator sortie. (T-2) Document all episodes of
   airsickness on AF Form 4293. (T-2)
   5.3.4. While participating in AMP, students continue the normal syllabus flow to include
   flying. (T-3) Limit student pharmacological therapy to a maximum of three sorties. (T-2)
   5.3.5. Commanders will process rated officers who cannot overcome airsickness problems
   according to AFI 48-123 and AFI 11-402. (T-1) Squadron supervisors should coordinate
   closely with the chief of aeromedical services for each of these special cases.
5.4. Manifestation of Apprehension. Refer to AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1.
5.5. Inflight G-Tolerance Problems. Refer to AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1.
5.6. Centrifuge Training. Conduct centrifuge training according to AFI 11-404, Centrifuge
Training for High-G Aircrew. In addition to AFI 11-404, the following policy applies to U.S.
students at T-38C SUPT and ENJJPT training locations and international SUPT students who
continue in the training pipeline (for example, IFF or PIT).
   5.6.1. First Attempt Failure. With SQ/CC occurrence, students who fail their first attempt
   but are recommended for solo flight in UPT on their centrifuge training report may continue
   in training while waiting for their reassessment; otherwise, commanders will place students
   on administrative hold and notify AETC/A3FP (reference paragraph 2.10.2). (T-3) In
   addition the FLT/CC will:
34                                                     AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014


     5.6.1.1. Ensure students receive a medical evaluation as soon as practical after the
     failure. (T-2)
     5.6.1.2. Review student centrifuge tapes for AGSM techniques and develop a training
     program as appropriate to work on AGSM technique and strength conditioning. (T-2)
     5.6.1.3. Ensure students are reassessed within 60 to 180 calendar days according to AFI
     11-404. Try to schedule the second attempt as close as practical to the 60-day threshold
     to minimize the time on administrative hold. If students pass their second attempt,
     remove them from administrative hold and resume their training according to the
     “Unusual Extended Break in Training” syllabus guidance. (T-3)
  5.6.2. Second Attempt Failure.
     5.6.2.1. With SQ/CC occurrence, students who fail their second attempt but are
     recommended for solo flight in UPT on their centrifuge training report will continue in
     training. (T-3) If students were already on administrative hold for failing their first
     attempt, they will be removed from administrative hold and resume training. (T-3) In
     either case, these students are ineligible for the Fighter/FAIP Track and will be placed in
     the Non-Fighter Track. (T-2) For international students, notify the IMSO and
     AETC/A3FP to determine follow-on action. (T-2)
     5.6.2.2. Students who fail their second attempt and are not recommended for solo flight
     in UPT will be placed on administrative hold or remain on administrative hold, as
     applicable. (T-2) Notify AETC/A3FP and AETC/A3R. AETC/A3R will coordinate
     follow-on actions with AETC/A1 and AFPC staffs. If the student is eliminated from T-
     38C SUPT or ENJJPT complete a CR prior to removing the student from training. (T-2)
     A full up CR is not required. Complete AETC Form 139 and distribute IAW the Table
     4.1. On AETC Form 139 mark “OTHER” as the reason for elimination and specify
     “Centrifuge Failure”.
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                               35

                                    STUDENT TRAINING

6.1. Flight Commander Responsibilities. The FLT/CC is the first echelon of command
responsible for safely and efficiently scheduling people, mission and aircraft. The FLT/CC must
know the capabilities and experience levels of all flight members and ensure they fly the right
mission at the right time according to applicable syllabuses and directives. Safety must remain
paramount in the FLT/CC’s mind. FLT/CCs will keep the operations supervisors informed of
the training plan and any changes and will:
   6.1.1. Supervise and monitor student training.
   6.1.2. Assist students and supervisors with the training review process and provide for
   discipline, physical and mental well-being, and general welfare of students. The FLT/CC
   must be aware of each student’s progress in all areas, including the potential effect of
   external factors (personal problems, etc.). FLT/CCs help students when they:
       6.1.2.1. Counsel students determined to be marginal performers or those placed on CAP
       and conduct follow-up counseling as often thereafter as necessary.
       6.1.2.2. Counsel students, as necessary, on appropriate management issues, including
       personal problems and disciplinary matters. If additional assistance is necessary, refer
       students to the appropriate base support agencies (Chaplain, Legal Office, etc.).
   6.1.3. Maintain student training folders according to Chapter 3 of this instruction, local
   guidance, and the applicable syllabus.
   6.1.4. Ensure student compliance and documentation of PT accomplishments.
   6.1.5. Coordinate with academic supervisors on individual student performance.
   6.1.6. Ensure students are briefed on assignment opportunities as applicable.
   6.1.7. Brief student leaders on the scope and limits of their responsibilities.
   6.1.8. Assist in syllabus-directed functions.
6.2. Syllabus Resource Management. The FLT/CC and SQ/CC are responsible for the
management of student flight hours. Each syllabus unit has an associated number of sorties or
missions and flight hours. On average, the syllabus mission and any AT, PC, or EC sorties
should reflect the average mission duration (AMD) for the unit of training. IPs should closely
adhere to the syllabus AMD. The AMD should not be exceeded except for extenuating
circumstances or to meet training objectives. (T-2)
6.3. Additional Training Sorties. AT sorties provide extra training to students in specific
circumstances, to include category check failure, break-in-training, CR reinstatement, syllabus
waiver, OG/CC corrective actions, or as otherwise specifically authorized by the syllabus. Refer
to the applicable syllabus for authorized AT sorties and specific guidelines.
   6.3.1. International (Coded XXX87). These sorties are authorized as outlined in the
   individual syllabus for international students who may not be able to meet MIF standards
   because of such factors as language or cultural differences. Obtain advance authorization for
   additional flying hours according to guidance in the individual syllabus and this instruction.
 36                                                      AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014


   6.3.2. Adaptation to Corrective Lenses (Coded XXX84). These sorties are authorized for
   students who experience training difficulties and require corrective lenses. Normally, these
   sorties are flown in the current unit; however, they may be flown in a different category if
   required. The next aircraft syllabus sortie flown after these sorties must be dual.
   6.3.3. Reallocation (Coded XXX85). A syllabus may authorize sorties designated for one
   unit to be flown in another unit. The reallocated sortie is designated as an “XXX85” in the
   appropriate category. Sorties will be flown prior to the appropriate end-of-unit lesson.
   6.3.4. Break-in-Training (Coded XXX86). These sorties are authorized for delays in
   training and will be flown only when remaining syllabus sorties are insufficient to
   compensate for the student’s break in training. Instructors should consider using the
   simulator instead of the aircraft if appropriate for the student’s category.
   6.3.5. Reinstatement by CR (Coded XXX87). These sorties may be authorized for students
   reinstated into training after a CR.
   6.3.6. Total Sortie/Flying Time (Coded XXX87). Students will fly these sorties to meet
   minimum syllabus sorties or flying time requirements. These sorties are normally full
   mission profile and are authorized when it becomes apparent they are needed.
   6.3.7. Prior to PC and EC (Coded XXX87). These sorties may be authorized before a PC
   and EC. These sorties are not automatically given to every student. They are reserved for
   cases where the SQ/CC determines some training irregularity or anomaly has occurred, and
   the student has demonstrated the potential to complete the syllabus within syllabus
   constraints. Document the training irregularity or anomaly as part of the AF Form 4293 AT
   authorization entry.
   6.3.8. Q-2/Q-3 Flight Evaluation (Coded XXX87). The flight evaluator may authorize these
   sorties as a result of a Q-2/Q-3 flight evaluation.
6.4. Ground Training Units (GTU):
   6.4.1. GTUs are instructional lessons that are normally prerequisites for simulator or aircraft
   missions and complement academic instruction.
   6.4.2. Instructors are responsible for teaching GTUs according to instructor guides. (T-2)
   Instructors may teach the GTUs to students on an individual or group basis.
   6.4.3. Syllabus time for GTUs is an approximate time to complete the lesson. Log the
   completion time, date, and actual training time in TIMS/GTIMS. (T-2)
6.5. UPT Formal Briefings Requirements:
   6.5.1. Flight Briefing.
      6.5.1.1. T-6A and T-38C SUPT and ENJJPT flights will conduct daily formal flight
      briefings before the first scheduled flying period. (T-2) The briefing will cover current
      and forecast weather and operations notes. Incorporate flying safety (paragraph 6.5.3)
      and standardization briefing (paragraph 6.5.4) as applicable. Unless excused by the
      FLT/CC, students and assigned instructors must attend the formal flight briefing;
      attached instructors are highly encouraged to attend. With SQ/CC or SQ/DO approval,
      the daily formal flight briefing may be waived to accommodate scheduling constraints.
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                                 37


     6.5.1.2. T-1A SUPT flights will conduct a formal flight briefing at least once a week. (T-
     2) This briefing may occur any time during the duty day and will cover appropriate
     administrative information, flight safety (weekly), ground safety (at least monthly),
     standardization briefing (paragraph 6.5.4), and a cockpit/crew resource management
     (CRM) topic (at least every other week according to paragraph 6.5.5). Brief operations
     notes, weather, and notices to airmen in individual crew briefings. On the days a group
     flight briefing is not accomplished, IPs will cover required information during individual
     crew briefings.
  6.5.2. Night Briefings. Instructors and students scheduled to fly local UPT night sorties will
  attend a formal night briefing prior to their first flight of each week’s night operations. (T-3)
  This briefing will cover departure and arrival procedures, spatial disorientation, visual
  illusions, and terrain avoidance to include minimum safe altitudes. If essential duties prevent
  instructors or students from attending the night briefing, a squadron supervisor will brief
  them before night flying. (T-3) For SUPT and ENJJPT, conduct a formal night briefing for
  T-6A and T-1A students and instructors before the beginning of the student’s first night
  sortie. (T-3) The night briefing may be combined with the formal flight briefing (paragraph
  6.5.1).
  6.5.3. Flying Safety Briefings. UPT flights will conduct these briefings at least once a
  normal workweek. (T-2) Briefings should emphasize aircraft mishap prevention and
  promote group discussion to improve student judgment and confidence.
  6.5.4. Standardization Briefings. Emphasize situational EPs to include overhead
  questioning and group discussions of selected topics. Briefings should be structured to assist
  in the development of judgment, proper application of procedures, and realistic use of
  available publications. The standardization briefing should include a standup EP situation.
     6.5.4.1. T-6A and T-38C SUPT and ENJJPT flights will conduct standardization
     briefings at least three times during a normal workweek. (T-2) The standardization
     briefings may be in conjunction with formal flight briefing or at a time that ensures
     maximum IP and student participation. T-6A flights will conduct these briefings
     throughout the program. (T-3) T-38C flights will conduct these briefings until the class
     is within 30 calendar days of graduation. (T-3) T-1A flights will conduct these briefings
     until the first student in the class has completed the transition category check. (T-3)
     6.5.4.2. If time does not permit, T-1A flights are not required to accomplish a standup
     EP during the formal flight briefing. However, in addition to the weekly standardization
     briefing, T-1A flights will conduct standup EPs at least three times a week until each
     student has successfully accomplished a standup situation as both pilot and copilot. (T-3)
  6.5.5. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Briefings. AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew
  Resource Management Program, and its AETC Supplement outline requirements for the
  CRM training program. CRM briefings will address human-factor causes in aircraft mishaps.
  (T-2) Use real-world mishaps as examples in the briefings. Conduct the briefings at least
  once every other week. (T-2) Brief and debrief CRM core concepts and skills on every
  aircraft and simulator mission. CRM briefings may be substituted for safety or
  standardization briefings, but they are not testable.
 38                                                         AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014


6.6. Mission Briefings. These briefings set the tone of the lesson. Cover specific objectives,
mission accomplishment, and specific flight or simulator restrictions. Discuss techniques and
procedures for flying the mission before or after the mission briefing. An instructor will brief
undergraduate students prior to all solo flights. (T-2) IPs having continuity with the student
should accomplish this briefing. Document the briefing on an AETC Form 39, Solo Briefing, or
a locally approved substitute. (T-2) Completing this form is self-explanatory. Post-mission
briefings measure the success in accomplishing the mission objectives. Refer to the appropriate
AFI 11-series publication for briefing formats. The applicable syllabus contains mission briefing
requirements.
6.7. UPT Student Standardization Program. The standardization program consists of
briefings and tests to ensure students maintain the highest proficiency level in procedural
knowledge and application. All students enrolled in a UPT course will take a weekly EP quiz
(EPQ) covering general and EP knowledge appropriate for the student’s stage of training. (T-2)
Students are required to take the EPQ until they complete the last aircraft sortie for their phase of
training. The minimum passing score on all flight line tests is 85 percent and 100 percent for
Boldface tests. (T-2) If an international student fails a written test, the instructor will determine
if English comprehension is a significant contributing factor. If so, the instructor may give the
student an oral retest. Except for T-1A flights, the EPQ may substitute for a standardization
briefing. Refer to the applicable syllabus for additional guidance.
   6.7.1. The EPQ may be administered in printed or electronic format. (T-2) Printed EPQs
   will be numbered sequentially for accounting purposes. (T-2) Immediately prior to
   administering the EPQ, the unit stan/eval member or testing administrator will:
       6.7.1.1. Generate a fresh 20-question EPQ from TIMS secure server with a
       representative number of questions from each assigned reading area. (T-2)
       6.7.1.2. Secure the room and administer the EPQ. (T-2)
       6.7.1.3. Collect any printed EPQs and answer sheets and account for each numbered
       copy. (T-2)
       6.7.1.4. Grade the EPQ; record the scores; and destroy all paper test copies, answer
       sheets, answer keys, and transparencies. (T-2) In addition, destroy electronic versions of
       tests that are stored outside of the TIMS database. (T-2)
   6.7.2. The following documents are available to supplement the standardization program:
       6.7.2.1. AETC Form 41, T-38C Emergency Procedures. This form contains a list of EPs
       to cover during a T-38C course. Completing this form is self-explanatory. In the blank
       space next to the specific EP, enter the date the EP situation was covered.
       6.7.2.2. AETC Form 46, T-6A Emergency Procedures. This form contains a list of EPs
       to cover during a T-6A course. Completing this form is self-explanatory. In the blank
       space next to the specific EP, enter the date the EP situation was covered.
       6.7.2.3. AETC Form 100A, T-1A Emergency Procedures. This form contains a list of
       EPs to cover during a T-1A course. Completing this form is self-explanatory. In the
       blank space next to the specific EP, enter the date the EP situation was covered.
       6.7.2.4. Boldface emergency procedures and operating limitations worksheets are
       available on the AETC/A3V website at
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                                  39


       https://www-r.aetc.af.mil/do/dof/download.asp.
6.8. Incomplete Sorties:
   6.8.1. Except for category checks, PCs, and ECs, the FLT/CC will determine if a sortie is
   incomplete. (T-2) He or she will:
       6.8.1.1. Evaluate each situation on an individual basis. (Note: If a student has had ample
       opportunity to learn a task on previous sorties and subsequently flies a short sortie, do not
       incomplete the sortie. Also do not incomplete a lesson solely because an individual
       maneuver is omitted when the omitted maneuver can be accomplished on a later sortie
       without degrading accomplishment of future training objectives.) (T-3)
       6.8.1.2. Consider the sortie’s effect on the quality of the student’s training and each
       student’s prior training opportunities as well as the remaining sorties available to
       accomplish training objectives. The syllabus provides a means for more AT sorties for
       students who do not progress to the end-of-unit MIF proficiency requirements.
       6.8.1.3. On end-of-unit sorties if a maneuver is graded below MIF, the sortie is complete
       and the overall grade is U. (T-2)
       6.8.1.4. Ensure both above- and below-average students are afforded the same training
       opportunities to refine their skills.
       6.8.1.5. Normally do not incomplete a solo sortie.
   6.8.2. Incomplete sorties do not break a string of unsatisfactory sorties.
6.9. Grading Procedures. Instructors will grade student training according to the applicable
syllabus. (T-2) The CTS is the baseline for all maneuver grading. Instructors must compare
student performance to the CTS before assigning maneuver grades. (T-2) When assigning a
maneuver grade, first grade the maneuver being flown. If the maneuver is flown below the
required proficiency level then determine if Risk Management/Decision Making, Task
Management, Situational Awareness, Crew Coordination and Emergency Procedures/General
Knowledge should also be downgraded (e.g., A student flies an unsafe landing and is directed to
go-around. Grade the landing first and then determine if situational awareness or risk
management/decision making should also be downgraded for failing to recognize an unsafe
situation.).
6.10. Category Checks. Category checks validate students have achieved the required
proficiency and (or) instructional level for a category, are conducted according to the applicable
syllabus, and are graded against the CTS using the required MIF proficiency and instructional
levels as the baseline.
   6.10.1. Profile. The Check FLT/CC (UPT courses) or the squadron stan/eval chief (graduate
   training courses) will ensure a cross-section of maneuvers optioned in the category check
   MIF are sampled regularly on category checks. (T-3)
   6.10.2. Grading. Category checks are syllabus events and the CTS must be applied exactly
   as on daily events. (T-2) The starting point for assigning any maneuver grade is the CTS
   which equates to satisfactory proficiency level or a letter grade of G. The instructor will
   grade student maneuvers according to the applicable syllabus, grading completed checks E,
   G, U or NG (no grade) overall. (T-2)
 40                                                       AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014


   6.10.3. Incomplete Checks. With Check FLT/CC (UPT courses) or the squadron stan/eval
   chief (graduate training courses) approval, checks may be considered incomplete if no
   maneuver completed by the student was graded below MIF and either all required maneuvers
   were not flown or the number of maneuvers flown was insufficient to reasonably assess the
   student’s overall performance. (T-2) If a check is incomplete, the student need only perform
   those maneuvers necessary to complete a normal check profile on the subsequent (refly)
   check. (T-3)
6.11. Check Flight CT Meetings (UPT only). The check FLT/CC will conduct check flight
CT meetings at least quarterly to ensure grading philosophy, practices and standards are
consistent and standardized. (T-2) All individuals who conduct category checks are required to
attend. (T-2) Document the meetings in enough detail to allow those who were unable to attend
to read, initial the meeting minutes, and understand what transpired. (T-2) Maintain copies of
the meetings minutes and slides (if used) for one year. (T-2) As a minimum, each meeting
should include a review of pass and fail rates by category for each check administered since the
last CT meeting, category check weak areas or trends, pass and fail rates of individual check
pilots, and at least one grading scenario brought to a conclusion. (T-2) Grading scenarios should
generate thoughtful discussion and reference to the individual CTS appropriate for the scenario.
Document the final recommended grade for each grading scenario in the CT minutes/slides. (T-
2)
6.12. Flight Evaluations. Conduct flight evaluations according to AFI 11-202, Volume
2/AETC Supplement, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, AFI 11-2MDS-specific
volumes 2, and the applicable syllabus.
6.13. Wash Back. When a student washes back into another class, the SQ/CC is the approving
authority for determining the appropriate TIMS/GTIMS version of the syllabus to use to
continue the student’s training. (T-3)
6.14. Civilian Flight Training. To maintain the integrity of the AETC training system,
students rated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (private pilot, commercial pilot,
etc.) may fly civilian aircraft once they enter into UPT, but they may not pursue additional
ratings or qualifications. (T-2) Students not rated by the FAA will not fly civilian aircraft after
entering into UPT. (T-2) Prior to conducting any civilian flying, students will complete an
AETC Form 410, High-Risk Activities Worksheet, and submit the form for commander approval.
(T-2)
6.15. Flight Planning Software use in UPT. Flight instruction of flight planning principles in
UPT is focused on the understanding of the key concepts involved in flight planning and
application those concepts through the use of flight planning software.
   6.15.1. In the Primary Phase, the objectives focus on the skills to produce computer
   generated flight planning products. Strong emphasis is placed on manual flight planning
   skills to validate computer-generated products. Primary Phase students will only use
   approved flight planning software for syllabus-directed events. (T-2)
   6.15.2. In the Advanced Phase, reinforce the flight planning skills and conceptual
   understanding learned in the Primary Phase. Students are required to plan and fly applicable
   sorties using software-based flight planning methods according to syllabus requirements. (T-

6.16. Vision Restricting Device (VRD). All T-6A student pilots will use the AETC standard
VRD for instrument training as directed by the appropriate syllabus. (T-2) IPs will ensure
student pilots properly stow the VRD prior to engine start and after landing prior to opening the
canopy. Local unit fabrication shops will supply the VRDs as required. (T-2)

      UNDERGRADUATE INTERNATIONAL TRAINING (EXCLUDES ENJJPT)

7.1. International Military Student (IMS) Training. IMSs receive Air Force formal course
training under the International Military Education and Training (IMET) Program, a foreign
military sales (FMS) case, a counter-drug program, or as part of a presidential draw down
initiative. These activities are part of the DoD SATP. The administration of SATP students
generally adheres to the procedures outlined in the preceding chapters, but there are certain
exceptions. This chapter addresses only those areas where SATP student administration differs
from Air Force student administration. Follow the procedures outlined in Chapters 1 through 6
for any area not covered in this chapter.
7.2. International Military Student Officer (IMSO). Each Air Force installation will appoint
an IMSO to handle administrative affairs per AFI 16-105. (T-1) Training units conducting
security assistance training, to include orientations, must maintain a close liaison with their
installation IMSO. The FLT/CC will notify the IMSO anytime a student is entered into CAP for
academic or flying deficiencies, placed on extended DNIF, or for any other reason that could
change the student’s scheduled graduation status. (T-2) In turn, IMSO will immediately notify
the applicable AFSAT country manager, who will keep country informed on all student issues.
(T-2)
7.3. Training Administration. AFSAT administers all international technical, flying,
professional military education, and basic military training within AETC. Units will send
questions about administrative procedures to the installation IMSO who, in turn, will notify the
appropriate AFSAT country manager. (T-2)
7.4. Student Data Screening. Training units will screen student records as outlined in AFI 16-
105. (T-1) The installation IMSO will conduct a thorough review of the student’s invitational
travel order (ITO) and appropriate amendments according to AFI 16-105. (T-1)
7.5. Student Training Records. The IMSO will maintain student training records according to
AFI 16-105. (T-1)
7.6. Assigning and Using Student Training Numbers. The U.S. Security Assistance office
from the IMS’s country will assign a student training number, consisting of four digits and two
letters and appearing immediately after the student’s name on the ITO. Enter this number
immediately after the student’s name on all records, certificates, awards, and other similar
documents. (T-2)
7.7. Training Summary. Training units will:
   7.7.1. Use AETC Form 240-5; DD Form 2496, International Student Academic Report; or
   an AETC/A3F-approved substitute for the training summary. (T-2) Note: The base IMSO
   will assist training units to complete required forms.
   7.7.2. Enter the SATP training number after the student’s name. (T-2)
   7.7.3. Record awards, special certificates, or other achievements after the course summary
   section. The training unit will attach a copy of award citations, letters of appreciation,
   certificates, etc., to the training summary. (T-2) The installation IMSO is responsible for
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                              43


   complying with AFI 16-105. The training unit will ensure the IMSO is aware of special
   awards of citations accompanying the training summary. (T-2)
   7.7.4. Enter the foreign country and IMET program year (or FMS case designator) and
   worksheet control number (WCN) in the top right corner of the AETC Form 240-5 (above
   “training base”). The training unit may obtain this data from the ITO or the base IMSO.
   Note: When using the DD Form 2496, enter this data in the appropriate blocks.
7.8. Additional Flying Hours:
   7.8.1. Requesting Additional Hours. With OG/CC approval, the IMSO will request
   additional aircraft hours from the appropriate AFSAT country manager to obtain country
   approval (for SUPT, hours in excess of the 10 additional hours authorized by the syllabus).
   (T-2) The request must include the student’s name, country, FMS case, line number, WCN,
   approximate number of additional hours required, and a summary of the student’s problems
   and the probability for successful course completion. On the request, include AETC/A3FP,
   AETC/A3RA and AETC/IA as informational addressees. OG/CC approval to fly additional
   sorties on an international student does not automatically increase the installation's
   programmed allocation of flying hours for the year. Any increase in programmed flying
   hours must be accomplished through the normal execution year flying hour adjustment
   process.
   7.8.2. Reporting Procedures for Additional Sorties or Hours. To ensure a student’s
   country is appropriately charged for additional sorties or hours flown, the IMSO will provide
   the following information within five duty days after course graduation (E-mail to:
   AFSAT.workflow@us.af.mil) (T-2):
       7.8.2.1. Student’s name.
       7.8.2.2. Training unit and base.
       7.8.2.3. Military articles and services listing number.
       7.8.2.4. WCN.
       7.8.2.5. Country, case, line, or IMET program year.
       7.8.2.6. Number of additional hours approved.
       7.8.2.7. Number of additional hours flown.
       7.8.2.8. Type of aircraft flown.
       7.8.2.9. Fiscal year when the hours were flown.
       7.8.2.10. Start training date and graduation date.
       7.8.2.11. POC name and telephone number.
7.9. Holiday Scheduling. All international military students may be authorized an additional
two days each year to observe national and (or) religious holidays. Coordinate specific days for
each country through AFSAT and the IMSO. (T-2)

                                          Chapter 8

                        UPT STUDENT ASSIGNMENT PROCESS

8.1. Overview:
   8.1.1. Students receive track and MWS assignments based on demonstrated potential to
   successfully complete required follow-on training. Track and MWS assignments consider
   three elements:
      8.1.1.1. Needs of the Air Force.
      8.1.1.2. Track or assignment availability.
      8.1.1.3. Student desires.
   8.1.2. To aid commanders in these decisions, the merit assignment selection system
   (MASS), a command-directed performance measurement tool, is provided. MASS provides
   student relative ranking within his or her class at each base and is used for student Advanced
   Track selection, MWS assignment, and final graduation order of merit.
   8.1.3. The WG/CC is the approval authority for all track selection and MWS assignment
   decisions. (T-2) Any waivers or deviations from this process must originate from the
   WG/CC for review by AETC/A3F. (T-2)
8.2. Career Information:
   8.2.1. Before track assignment and again before MWS assignment, wings will provide
   students with MWS-specific career information. (T-2) This information should help students
   make informed choices when requesting specific training tracks or aircraft. Specific
   information should include mission duties, career path and advancement opportunities, and
   average TDY commitments.
   8.2.2. Units will brief students that, under the current Total Force Absorption Plan, active
   duty graduates may be assigned to reserve component units. (T-2) Present the information
   via briefings, career days, and (or) other practical means. SUPT students will make their
   career requests on AF Form 3849, PME/AFIT/RTFB/Officer Worksheet, or local OG/CC-
   approved form. (T-3) Figure 8.1 is an example AF Form 3849. Note: Inform students with
   special-needs dependents or other special circumstances to make these situations known to
   their chain of command.

8.3. Merit Assignment Selection System:
   8.3.1. FLT/CC or appropriate squadron representative will present a comprehensive briefing
   to each class to ensure understanding of the MASS methodology. (T-2) The FLT/CC or
   other appropriate squadron representative must ensure he or she subsequently briefs any
   student who is unavoidably absent. (T-2)
   8.3.2. MASS generates a merit ranking which is an overall assessment of the student’s
   airmanship and capability based upon demonstrated performance. It includes the FLT/CC’s
   assessment of the student’s flying skills, leadership, teamwork, officership, attitude, and
   potential to complete follow-on training.
   8.3.3. A TIMS/GTIMS MASS transaction is required for each UPT class after the Primary
   (track selection) and Advanced (MWS assignment) Phases. (T-2) Run a finalized MASS to
   determine class merit order for each SUPT and ENJJPT class after the Primary and
   Advanced Phases. (T-2) The training unit must finalize the MASS prior to class phase
   graduation and after any and all intermediate MASS calculations are complete. (T-2) OG/CC
   ensures a finalized MASS is performed in TIMS/GTIMS. (T-2)
8.4. Computing MASS Standardized Scores. Use the following statistical methodology to
compute MASS standardized scores. (T-2) Refer to Figure 8.2 through Figure 8.5 for MASS
calculation formulas.

Figure 8.2. Mean ().




Figure 8.3. Standard deviation ().
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                             47


Figure 8.4. Z-Score (Z).




   8.4.1. T-score: T = 50 + 10 (z-score). Tscores are weighted according to these calculations.
   Add the weighted T-scores to compute the total merit score.
   8.4.2. Compute maneuver (M) scores for daily flying and check performance based on the
   following formula:

Figure 8.5. M-Score (M).




       8.4.2.1. Each maneuver has scores for unable, fair, good, and excellent. Critical
       maneuvers are weighted more heavily (Landing is weighted more than aileron roll.).
       Weighted grade values for individual maneuvers are available in the maneuver grade
       files. For an incomplete sortie or a PC/EC sortie following a failed category check, the
       maneuver score is based on the first graded attempt of the maneuver.
       8.4.2.2. AETC/A3FP determines subarea weights.
8.5. SUPT Merit Ranking. Use Preflight and Primary Phase data for track selection only. (T-2)
Use only Advanced Phase data to determine assignment selection rank. (T-2) Use the MASS
tables   located   on     the     AETC/A3F       website,     https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC13492A0FB5E044080020E329A9. (T-2)
8.6. ENJJPT Merit Ranking. Assignment merit ranking is based on 40 percent T-6A and 60
percent T-38C performance. (T-2) Use the MASS tables located on the AETC/A3F website,
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC13492A0FB5E044080020E329A9. (T-2)
8.7. Example Calculation. This example calculates the T-6A total score for SUPT. Similar
methodology applies to the other UPT programs. Refer to Table 8.1 through Table 8.6
   8.7.1. Category Check Maneuver Scores. Compute using percentage score, multiply by
   weighting factor, and total. Use this total to compute a T-score for category check
   maneuvers.

Table 8.1. Category Check Maneuver Scores.
 Midphase Contact 215 pts received/235 pts possible     = .91489 × 100 = 91.489 × .16 =       14.638
 Contact            228 pts received/235 pts possible   = .97021 × 100 = 97.021 × .28 =       27.166
 Instrument         232 pts received/235 pts possible   = .98723 × 100 = 98.723 × .28 =       27.642
 Formation          339 pts received/365 pts possible   = .92876 × 100 = 92.876 × .28 =       26.005
                                                            Total Category Check Points =     95.452
Note: Assuming the mean for this class’s category checks is 93.422 with a standard deviation of
3.270, then this student’s 95.452 total category check points yield a z-score of +0.6208, resulting
in a category check maneuver T-score of 56.208.

Table 8.2. Category T-Score
Category Check Score           =    95.452
Class Mean                     =    93.422
Standard Deviation             =     3.270
z-Score                        = (+0.6208)
Category Check T-Score         =    56.208
   8.7.2. Daily Performance Scores. Compute the daily performance scores using a T-score
   generated from student’s daily maneuver percentage score.

Table 8.3. Daily Maneuver T-Score
 Daily Maneuvers (9600 pts received/14284 pts possible)          = .67208 × 100     =     67.208
                                                                     Class Mean     =     71.237
                                                              Standard Deviation    =      5.941
                                                                         z-Score    = (–0.6783)
                                                      Daily Maneuver T-Score =            43.218
Note: Assuming the mean for this class’s daily maneuvers is 71.237 and a standard deviation
of 5.941, then this student’s 67.208 total points yield a z-score of –0.6783 resulting in a daily
maneuver T-score of 43.218.

   8.7.3. Academic Scores. Students’ academic test averages are used to compute their z-
   scores. Only the first test attempt counts in the student’s academic test average. Instructors
   will ensure all retakes of failed academic tests are entered as retakes.
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                               49


Table 8.4. Academic T-Score
 Academic Test Average           =    96.891
 Class Mean                      =    96.060
 Standard Deviation              =      1.886
 z-Score                         =      0.4406
Academic T-Score                 =    54.406
Note: In this example, the student’s academic test average is 96.891. Assuming the
class average is 96.060 with a standard deviation of 1.886, then the resulting z-score is
+0.4406 yielding an academic T-score of 54.406.

   8.7.4. FLT/CC Ranking. Use the FLT/CC ranking scores to compute a z-score. In this
   example, we use a ranking of 5 out of 15 = 95.71.

Table 8.5. FLT/CC Ranking T-Score
 FLT/CC Ranking (5th of 15)      =      95.710
 Class Mean                      =      92.500
 Standard Deviation              =       4.652
 z-Score                         =       0.690
FLT/CC Ranking T-Score =                 56.90
Note: By design, the mean for all classes’ FLT/CC ranking is 92.500. However the standard
deviation varies depending on class size. In this case, we use a standard deviation of 4.652;
then this student’s 95.710 yields a z-score of +0.690, resulting in a FLT/CC ranking T-score of
56.900.

8.8. SUPT Student Assignment Process. This section applies only to U.S. students at
Columbus, Laughlin, and Vance AFBs.
   8.8.1. Track Assignment Process:
      8.8.1.1. Overview. Use the T-6A merit order to assist with assigning Advanced Tracks.
      (T-2) AETC/A3R will allocate and forward Advanced Track authorizations (T-1A, T-
      38C, and TH-1H) to each SUPT wing based on each wing’s assignment-eligible students
      no later than five duty days before the Primary Phase completion date. (T-2) Tracks are
50                                                      AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014


     assigned during the last week of the Primary Phase after all assignment-eligible students
     have completed their category checks. (T-2)
     8.8.1.2. Merit Order Calculation. Each OG/CC will compute the T-6A merit order for
     all students. (T-2) Each FLT/CC will rank assigned students using the Flight
     Commander            Ranking          Matrix      at      https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
     af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC13492A0FB5E044080020E329A
     9. (T-2) Merge the two flight merit orders, producing a class standing (merit order) by
     total point score (no ties). Note: The official MASS score is always a full-class MASS.
     The TIMS/GTIMS student manager must identify the class as a single entity (for
     example, 0604 T-6A, not 0604 T-6A A FLT and 0604 T-6A B FLT) and then assign the
     students into their specific flights. Contact AETC/A3F for questions regarding MASS
     calculations.
     8.8.1.3. Track Assignment Procedures:
        8.8.1.3.1. Prior to track assignment, each assignable student will complete AF Form
        3849, Part II, to indicate a preference order for advanced training. (T-2) The
        student’s assigned IP will make a training recommendation for each track on the AF
        Form 3849. (T-2) Figure 8.1 provides a sample AF Form 3849 including
        information needed in Part IV. The FLT/CC will concur or nonconcur with remarks.
        (Note:      Remarks are required if the FLT/CC nonconcurs with the IP’s
        recommendation. These remarks may be continued on the back of the form, if
        necessary.) Base the recommendation on each student’s demonstrated skills and
        potential to complete advanced training.
        8.8.1.3.2. The SQ/CC and FLT/CCs will convene and assign students to advanced
        training, as follows:
            8.8.1.3.2.1. Rank students for advanced training in merit order.
            8.8.1.3.2.2. Give the top 10 percent of graduates their first choice if available. (T-
            3) For example, in a class of 15 students, the top 10 percent would be 1.5
            students. Round numbers 0.5 and above to the next higher number, making the
            top 10 percent (in this example) two students.
            8.8.1.3.2.3. Use rank order listing and the student’s AF Form 3849 to provide the
            best match of the student’s skills, potential, desires, and available training quotas.
            (T-3) Students receive their first choice of an Advanced Track if it is available
            and if the individual student’s IP and FLT/CC recommend the student for that
            track.
            8.8.1.3.2.4. Go to the second (third, etc.) choice when the student’s first choice is
            not available or the student is not recommended for that track. If that track is
            available and the student is recommended, assign the student to that track. (T-3)
            8.8.1.3.2.5. Assign the quota for students not recommended for a specific training
            quota to a student recommended for that training, but previously assigned to
            another track (for example, a T-38C quota is unfilled, but remaining students are
            not recommended for T-38C training). (T-3) This frees up the training quota
            previously assigned but may require additional changes. In all cases, consider the
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                             51


            student’s skill, potential, and desires as well as the needs of the Air Force when
            assigning advanced training.
         8.8.1.3.3. The WG/CC is actively involved in the track selection process. The
         WG/CC is the approving authority to ensure students are assigned to SUPT tracks
         based on demonstrated potential to successfully complete the track. (T-2)
         8.8.1.3.4. The OG/CC will forward copies of the final merit order and track
         assignment to AETC/A3RA within two duty days after final approval. (T-2)
         8.8.1.3.5. Units will report any student bound for a fighter or bomber track with a
         MASS rating below 50 to AETC/A3FP and AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as
         appropriate. (T-2)
  8.8.2. MWS Assignment Process. Students receive MWS assignments based on their
  potential to successfully complete required follow-on training. After receiving assignments
  from AFPC/DPAOT and not later than 11 duty days before the scheduled assignment night,
  AETC/A1KO will provide the SUPT WG/CCs with their respective assignment block and
  those of the other bases. (T-2) If an appropriate MWS assignment is not available in the
  assignment block, WG/CCs may work assignment swaps (within an assignment block) with
  other WG/CCs to better meet Air Force needs and student desires. WG/CCs may also
  request the assistance of AETC/A1KO to obtain an appropriate MWS assignment based on a
  suitable match with the student’s skill and potential. Coordinate assignment swaps with
  AETC/A1KO and accomplish them before students receive their assignments. (T-2)
  AETC/A1K is the final approving authority for assignment block distribution between the
  SUPT bases. (T-2) Assignment night is no later than two weeks before graduation. Use the
  Advanced Track merit order to assist with MWS aircraft and location assignments, as
  follows:
     8.8.2.1. Merit Order Calculation. The OG/CC will compute the T-1A and T-38C merit
     order for all students. (T-2) T-1A students must complete transition and navigation
     category checks to compete for assignment with their class. (T-2) T-38C students must
     complete transition, two-ship formation, and instrument/navigation category checks to
     compete for assignment with their class. (T-2) Contact AETC/A3F for MASS
     calculation questions.
     8.8.2.2. MWS Assignment Procedures.
         8.8.2.2.1. The FLT/CC will assess T-38C student performance no later than three
         weeks prior to assignment night. (T-2) If a student’s demonstrated performance
         marks him or her as a better candidate for a crew aircraft, the FLT/CC will make
         every effort to secure a bomber slot for the student; however, the student may be
         assigned to fixed-wing aircraft outside the normal specialization based on the needs
         of the Air Force. (T-3)
         8.8.2.2.2. Before assignment night, all assignable students will complete AF Form
         3849 or local OG/CC-approved form, indicating (in order) their choice of MWS
         aircraft. (T-2) The assigned IP will make a first assignment instructor pilot (FAIP)
         recommendation for each student on AF Form 3849. (T-2) Base the recommendation
         on the student’s demonstrated flying and interpersonal skills, maturity, and potential
52                                                  AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014


     to return as an FAIP.     The FLT/CC concurs or nonconcurs (with remarks for
     nonconcur).
     8.8.2.2.3. Identify FAIPs with a follow-on assignment to one of two generic tracks
     (fighter/bomber or tanker/airlift). (T-2) WG/CCs will not change this FAIP
     assignment process. (T-2)
     8.8.2.2.4. The SQ/CC and FLT/CCs will convene and assign students MWS aircraft
     as follows:
        8.8.2.2.4.1. Rank students in merit order for MWS aircraft. (T-2)
        8.8.2.2.4.2. If available, the top 10 percent of graduates should receive their first
        choice. (T-3) For example, in a class of 15 students, the top 10 percent would be
        1.5 students. Round numbers 0.5 and above to the next higher number, making
        the top 10 percent (in this example) two students. Note: Do not assign FAIP duty
        to the top 10 percent unless they specifically volunteer.
        8.8.2.2.4.3. Use the rank order listing and the student’s AF Form 3849 to provide
        the best match of the student’s desires with available MWS aircraft. (T-3)
        8.8.2.2.4.4. When a quota for an FAIP is unfilled and the remaining students are
        not recommended for FAIP duty, assign the quota to a student recommended for
        FAIP duty but previously assigned to another aircraft. (T-3) This frees up the
        aircraft previously assigned and may require additional changes.              Note:
        Individuals are not usually selected for FAIP duty in an aircraft they did not fly in
        SUPT. The WG/CC requests exceptions to this policy and coordinates through
        AETC/A3F and AETC/A3R, with AETC/A2/3/10 approval.
        8.8.2.2.4.5. For rated management reasons, do not assign FAIP duty to captains
        (as of graduation), even if they volunteer. (T-2)
     8.8.2.2.5. The WG/CC is actively involved in actions affecting SUPT students in the
     assignment selection process and makes the final decision on the best match of
     student skill, potential, and desire with available aircraft. The WG/CC will provide a
     list of finalized assignment selections and merit rank order to AETC/A1KO not later
     than one duty day before the scheduled assignment night. (T-2)
     8.8.2.2.6. AETC/A1KO will check assignment selections for potential errors and
     coordinate with the appropriate WG/CC for final release of student assignments. (T-
     2) AETC/AIKO will compile the results and forward them to AFPC/DPAOT no later
     than the following Monday after assignment night. (T-2)
     8.8.2.2.7. Squadron supervisors will establish procedures to announce track and
     assignment drops. (T-3) In addition, they will closely monitor student performance
     after MWS assignment.
     8.8.2.2.8. When appropriate, squadron, operations group, and wing personnel will
     work with AETC/A1KO to coordinate any assignment changes necessitated by post-
     MWS assignment performance. (T-3)
AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014                                                             53


8.9. ENJJPT Student Assignment Process (U. S. Students):
   8.9.1. Merit Order Calculation.
      8.9.1.1. The FLT/CCs and Chief of UPT will compute the merit order for ENJJPT
      students. (T-2) The total point score determines class standing (merit order). Each
      FLT/CC will rank assigned students using the ENJJPT Officer Quality Evaluation and the
      preliminary MASS for that phase as a reference. (T-2) The Chief of UPT will then meet
      with both FLT/CCs for that ENJJPT class to merge the two flight merit orders, producing
      a class standing (merit order) by total point score (no ties) using the Flight Commander
      Ranking Matrix (paragraph 8.8.1.2). (T-2)
      8.9.1.2. The official MASS score is always a full class MASS. (T-2) The TIMS/GTIMS
      student manager must identify the class as a single entity (for example, 0604 T-6A, not
      0604 T-6A A FLT and 0604 T-6A B FLT) and then assign the students into their specific
      flights. Contact AETC/A3F for questions regarding MASS calculations.
      8.9.1.3. Each student must have completed the T-38C contact, transition, and advanced
      formation (2-Ship) category checks to compete for assignment with that class. (T-2) In
      case of unforeseen circumstances that prevent the completion of any one of these
      category checks by all students in the class, the OG/CD will determine what point in
      training to use as the cutoff for the MASS computation.
   8.9.2. MWS Assignment Process:
      8.9.2.1. AETC/A1KO will, after receiving assignments from AFPC/DPAOT, provide the
      assignment block to the WG/CC and inform the U.S. SNR four weeks before graduation.
      Match students to assignments according to ENJJPT procedures. Assignment night is no
      later than two weeks before graduation. (T-2)
      8.9.2.2. Three weeks before assignment night, U.S. students will rank-order their choices
      of MWS aircraft on AF Form 3849 or local OG/CC-approved form and provide them to
      the FLT/CC. (T-2)
      8.9.2.3. One week before assignment night, the assigned IP, FLT/CC, and MTO will
      review the AF Form 3849, make appropriate FAIP recommendations, and forward them
      to the student training FLT/CC. (T-2) For rated management reasons, do not assign FAIP
      duty to captains (as of graduation), even if they volunteer. (T-2)
      8.9.2.4. The MTO, student training FLT/CC, and U.S. SNR (who coordinate as required
      with SQ/CCs) will convene and assign students to MWS aircraft using the guidance
      outlined for SUPT and ENJJPT. (T-3)
      8.9.2.5. The WG/CC will approve and forward a copy of the final class merit order and
      MWS assignment matches to AETC/A1KO no later than one duty day before assignment
      night. (T-2)
      8.9.2.6. AETC/A1KO will compile the results and forward them to AFPC/DPAOT no
      later than the following Monday after assignment night. (T-2) This completes all actions
      required to process the assignments.

                                    STUDENT AWARDS

9.1. Overview. The WG/CC will establish and maintain a program to present awards to
students selected as outstanding in academics, military qualities, and flying training. (T-3)
Duplicate awards may be presented for ties. AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards, governs
appropriations for such awards. A wing awards council or similar process will nominate and
select students for awards approved by the WG/CC. (T-2) ENJJPT Steering Committee
Directive 3-1, Student Administration, and 80th FTW guidance determine ENJJPT student
awards available only through the local Sheppard AFB intranet.
9.2. Distinguished Graduate (DG) Awards. Each OG/CC may select DGs from the students
in each track of a class and present them a plaque during graduation. For each class, the OG/CC
is the final approving authority for all awards. As a minimum, a DG award requires a student to
be in the upper 10 percent of the graduating class. (T-2) Use MASS data from both the Primary
and Advanced Phases. (T-3) If Primary Phase MASS data is unavailable, use only Advanced
Phase MASS data. (T-3) Select DGs from the upper 10 percent of each track. (T-3) (Round
numbers .5 and above to the next higher number.) If a DG is an ANG or AFRC member, notify
AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as appropriate, as soon as possible to ensure appropriate
representation.
9.3. Order of Daedalians AETC Commander’s Trophy. (T-3) This award is presented to the
student in each class with the highest MASS score from each track using the combined MASS
data from the Primary and Advanced Phases of SUPT. The score is weighted using 40 percent
Primary and 60 percent Advanced. If Primary Phase MASS data is unavailable, use only
Advanced Phase MASS data. The OG/CC notifies the Order of Daedalians of the recipient’s
name before class graduation and presentation. The WG/CC (or designated representative)
presents the trophies during the graduation ceremony. The trophy should be approximately 6 to
7-inch tall, cast bronze statue of an eagle with outstretched wings and talons, mounted on a 1
1/2-inch tall circular base. Trophy variations are authorized.

Figure 9.2. Daedalian AETC Commander’s Trophy Plate




9.4. Academic and Flying Training Awards. (T-3) The academic training award is presented
to the student in each track with the highest academic MASS score for the Primary and
Advanced Phases. The flying training award is presented to the student in each track with the
highest combined daily sortie and category check sortie MASS scores for both the Primary and
Advanced Phases. The OG/CC is the approving authority for these awards. If Primary Phase
MASS data is unavailable, use only Advanced Phase MASS data to determine the
academic/flying training award recipients.
9.5. Orville Wright Achievement Award:
   9.5.1. This Daedalian Foundation award is given to the most outstanding SUPT or ENJJPT
   graduate of the quarter and consists of an engraved plaque and a citation presented by a
   member of the Order of Daedalians. Students of any military branch are eligible for this
   quarterly award.
   9.5.2. Each UPT base may nominate one student per quarter. Send the nomination package
   to AETC/A3FP within 10 duty days after the end of the quarter. (T-2) Students must have
   graduated during the quarter nominated. (T-2) Nomination package should include a
   nomination memorandum from the WG/CC; a biographical sketch (optional); a copy of the
   nominee’s Primary and Advanced Phase AETC Forms 240-5 and the forwarding address for
   the nominee’s follow-on training unit. Do not include the nominee’s social security number
   in the nomination memorandum.
   9.5.3. An award board at AETC/A3F will select the award recipient. AETC/A3F will
   inform the nominating units, the gaining squadron commander, and the Order of Daedalians
   of the graduate selected for the award. The Order of Daedalians will forward the award to
   the appropriate base for presentation.
9.6. Awards to IMSs. As soon as possible after the decision is made to present an award to a
SUPT IMS, the unit will notify the AFSAT/CC through the base IMSO. (T-2)
 56                                                     AETCI36-2205V4 5 September 2014


9.7. DG Awards:
   9.7.1. Units will develop their own methods of identifying up to the top 10 percent of
   students in basic courses as DGs. (T-3) Classes of less than 10 may have one DG. Any
   fractions may be rounded upward. Commanders may elect not to designate a DG in a class.
   9.7.2. DG programs recognize students who clearly excel during formal training. Formalize
   the DG program in local guidance. (T-3) DGs must demonstrate outstanding progress in
   each phase of academic, simulator, and flying training, and outstanding results in flying and
   simulator evaluations. The unit commander is the final approving authority for all awards.
   (T-3)
   9.7.3. The DG will receive an AETC Form 499 (or locally approved substitute). (T-3)
