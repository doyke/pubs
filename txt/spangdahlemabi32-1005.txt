1. General.
   1.1. The standardization of base signage is intended to convey the values and professional
   image of the United States Air Force while not conflicting with Host Nation signage
   regulations. Standardization of the size and color of base signage is essential for both
   economy and general base appearance.
   1.2. If a requested sign is not covered in this document, UFC 3-120-0, will serve as the
   default sign guidelines.
   1.3. This document is not intended to address all possible signage options specified in UFC
   3-120-01 and specific base Housing Community Plans.
   1.4. This document does not apply to signs placed in and around the airfield environment for
   the purpose of providing information for operating aircraft. Such signs must comply with the
   requirements of AFI 32-1044, Visual Air Navigation Systems.
   1.5. All signs not conforming to this standard will be replaced by attrition. All unauthorized
   signs will be removed without notice.
   1.6. All names will be spelled out in full whenever possible. If abbreviations are required,
   they must conform to Air Force Doctrine Document 1-2, Air Force Glossary.
   1.7. Signs will be kept to a minimum to enhance base appearance and minimize maintenance
   costs IAW AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities. Signs will be replaced during normal
   maintenance cycles, when found damaged or faded, or when text or symbol changes are
   required.
   1.8. Visual clutter will be reduced by eliminating super graphics, poorly designed signs and
   outdated information. Stenciled, spray-painted or hand-lettered signs do not provide the
   professional quality required and are not allowed. Low profile signs will be used wherever
   possible to minimize impact upon the facade.
   1.9. Some signage may require reimbursement from the requesting organization prior to
   manufacturing or purchase.
   1.10. All signage will be in English and/or German.
   1.11. To reduce maintenance costs, signs should not be placed on buildings except where
   absolutely necessary.

SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1005 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                         5


3. Exterior Signage.
   3.1. General considerations.
      3.1.1. IAW UFC 3-120-01, other than facility numbers, direct-painted applications are
      not allowed on facilities and will be removed without notice.
      3.1.2. Commercial Agencies (e.g. Banks, Army Air Force Exchange Services (AAFES),
      Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), etc.) may purchase, fabricate, and install exterior
      signage at their facilities, but only after they have obtained approval through the AF
      Form 332 process. Furthermore, description, size, color, verbiage, and location must be
      provided and approved by the 52 CES Community Planner to meet criteria identified in
      UFC 3-120-01, to include general landscaping and community compatibility.
      3.1.3. All exterior signage will consist of reflective white letters on a “park service
      brown” background, unless otherwise noted or guided by regulations. All letters will be
      Helvetica medium upper and lower case unless otherwise noted or guided by regulations.
      Font size is based upon the type of signs used and any applicable Manual on Uniform
      Traffic Control Devices. Traffic control signs following the German traffic regulation
      standards will also adopt the related font and font size.
      3.1.4. Sign posts will be 60mm (2 1/2”) in diameter, sleeved in the ground, and be “park
      service brown” in color. The sleeve will be set in concrete.
   3.1.5. Exterior signs showing any kind of textual information in one single language will be
   written in English. Multilingual exterior signs, when required, will be written in English and
   German only.
   3.2. Installation Main Entrance Signs.
      3.2.1. General description. Installation Main Entrance Signs greet visitors and create a
      first impression of the base. Installation Main Entrance Signs will be based on UFC 3-
      120-01 Type A2 Sign.
      3.2.2. Placement. One Installation Entry Sign is placed in front of the installation’s main
      vehicle entrance gates.
      3.2.3. Material. The symbol and letterforms will be constructed of stainless steel or
      aluminum, approximately ½” in depth. The symbol and letterforms are to be mounted in
      such a way as to provide a minimum ½” clearance from the background surface. The
      background material should be durable and require minimal maintenance.
      3.2.4. Information. The Installation Main Entrance Sign will report:
          3.2.4.1. The title “U.S. AIR FORCE” in upper case letters.
          3.2.4.2. The installation name in upper and lower case letters.
          3.2.4.3. The Air Force Symbol.
      3.2.5. Colors. White lettering with brown background or brown lettering on an off white
      background will be used.
      3.2.6. Layout. See Figure 1 for sign layout. Dimensions shown are based on application
      to the standard Sign Type A2. When conditions require a larger or smaller application of

        3.2.8. Typography.
        3.2.9. “U.S. AIR FORCE” in upper case letters, 125 mm (5”) Cap.
        3.2.10. Installation name in upper and lower case letters, 75 mm (3”) Cap.
     3.3. Street Signs.
        3.3.1. General description. Street signs are an important way to provide orientation on
        base and to promote SAB heritage.
        3.3.2. Placement. Street Signs will be placed at street intersections and where practical,
        shall be placed in the northwest corner of the intersection of named roadways. If it is a
        T-intersection and there is not a northwest corner, then the sign shall be placed in the
        southwest or northeast corner, depending on the configuration of the intersection. To
        maintain uniformity, signs should be placed 1.5 m to 2 m (5’ to 6’8”) back from the road
        curbing to provide easy identification from the roadway and to avoid conflicts with the
        sidewalks.
        3.3.3. Information. Street Signs will report the official name of that particular street
        without any emblem or logo.
        3.3.4. Colors. White reflective lettering and a white border on standard brown
        background will be used.
        3.3.5. Layout. Graphics on Street Signs may appear on both sides, since they are placed
        perpendicular to the roadway and can be viewed by traffic moving in both directions (see
        Figure. 2).
SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1005 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                              7


Figure 2. Street Sign, Layout.




       3.3.6. Dimensions. Slats - 125 mm (5”) x 300 mm (1’-0”) minimum. Sign width will
       vary in 150 mm (6”) increments as required to accommodate longer street names.
       3.3.7. Typography. Upper (for the word first letters) and lower case (other word letters)
       Helvetica medium, 75 mm (3") capital letter height, centered.
       3.3.8. Mounting. Street Signs will be placed upon a metal post approximately 2100 mm
       (7’) in height. If more than one sign is placed on a pole, the street sign will always be the
       topmost sign.
   3.4. Directional signs.
       3.4.1. All directional signs should form part of a logical system that directs each visitor
       and new base personnel from the base main point of entry through every intersection to a
       final destination.
       3.4.2. Directional signs will be used for highly frequented or specific interest base
       facilities. It is not the intent to clutter the base with proliferate sign usage, but simply to
       ensure the basic needs of visitors are met. Care should be taken in placement, taking into
       consideration safety, visibility, and practicality.
       3.4.3. Usage. Different type of directional signs will be used depending on the usage:
          3.4.3.1. Directional Signs at traffic intersections
          3.4.3.2. Directional Signs at traffic circles
       3.4.4. Directional Signs at traffic intersections, normal size
          3.4.4.1. General description. Directions at traffic intersections will be provided, as
          the preferred option, with a type D-2 Directional Sign (see UFC 3-120-01).
          3.4.4.2. Placement. The type D-2 Directional Sign will be placed at traffic
          intersections. The sign should be placed on the right side of the street and at a
          distance of approximately 60 m (200’) prior to the intersection.
       3.4.4.3. Information. The D-2 type Directional Sign will report up to 4 destination
       names. If it is necessary to show more than four destinations, add a second sign, but do
       not use more than two directional signs in any situation.
          3.4.4.4. Colors. White lettering with standard brown background will be used.

          3.4.4.5. Layout. As the layout in Figure 3 indicates, messages are placed flush left or
          flush right in relation to the arrow. Arrows pointing left or up will have flush left
          messages, and arrows pointing to the right will have flush right messages. The arrow
          is centered in the space between the message and the edge of the sign. One slat per
          direction will be used and up to 4 slat can be used for indicating up to 4 directions.

Figure 3. Type D-2 Directional Sign, layout and dimensions (2 slat example)




          3.4.4.6. Dimensions. Each destination slat will be 300 mm (1´-0”) high, 1800 mm
          (6’-0”) wide (see Figure 3). If the sign is placed where parking and/or pedestrian
          movement is likely to occur, or if there are other obstructions to view, a clear height
          of 2100 mm (7’-0”) tp the bottom of the sign should be maintained. Maintain a clear
          height of 1 500 mm (5’-0”) if no such hazards exist.
          3.4.4.7. Typography. Upper and lower case Helvetica medium, 100 mm (4”) capital
          letter, flush left or right to arrow. The message area of each slat will accommodate a
          maximum of 17 tiles or characters.
          3.4.4.8. Arrow. Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices standard 116 mm x 175
          mm ( 4 5/8”x 7”).
      3.4.5. Directional Signs at traffic intersections, small size.
          3.4.5.1. General description. Directions at traffic intersections, where the normal
          sized D-2 type sign described in chapter 3.4.4 cannot be placed, will be provided with
          a small sized Directional Sign. The usage of that small sized sign can be
          implemented in areas with space constraints or obstruction concerns and the
          maximum authorized speed is less or equal to 50 Kmph.
          3.4.5.2. Placement. The small size Directional Sign will be placed at traffic
          intersections. The sign should be placed on the right side of the street and at a
          distance of approximately 60 m (200’) prior to the intersection.
SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1005 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                         9


      3.4.5.3. Information. The small size Directional Sign will report up to 6 destination
      names. If it is necessary to show more than 6 destinations, add a second sign, but do not
      use more than two directional signs in any situation.
          3.4.5.4. Colors. White lettering with standard brown background will be used.
          3.4.5.5. Layout. As the layout in Figure 4 indicates, messages are placed flush left or
          flush right in relation to the arrow. Arrows pointing left or up will have flush left
          messages, and arrows pointing to the right will have flush right messages. The arrow
          is centered in the space between the message and the edge of the sign. One slat per
          direction will be used and up to 6 slats can be used for indicating up to 6 directions.

         3.5.2.3. Material. The number will be, whenever compatible with the wall structure,
         directly painted on the building wall (see Figure 8).

Figure 8. Building Number




         3.5.2.4. Information. The Building Number marking will report only the facility
         identification number with no additional information nor graphic.
      3.5.2.5. Color. The Building Number letters will be in standard park service brown with
      a contrasting background. The Building Number background will be chosen of the same
      wall background color if the existing wall color is contrasting (e.g. use beige Building
      Number background if the wall is already paint in the same beige).
         3.5.2.6. Layout. The numbers will be shown in a diagonal pattern with the first digit
         placed in the upper left and the last number following diagonally down and to the
         right. The numbers will be in line with each other diagonally; superscript and
         subscript are unacceptable.
         3.5.2.7. Typography. Upper case Helvetica medium, height and width of the
         numbering shall be approximately 39.4 cm (15.5”) and 25.4 cm (10’’) respectively.
         No shadow effect will be implemented.
         3.5.2.8. Variations.   Building shape and other irregularities occasionally require
         variations, e.g.:
             3.5.2.8.1. Signs with metal background panel can be used for buildings that does
             not have flat surfaces (e.g. trapezoid metal wall structure, masonry facades...) and
             doesn’t allow direct painted application.
             3.5.2.8.2. For facilities with dark wall background color, implement a rectangular
             shaped white Building Number background with the standard park service brown
             letters to ensure appropriate contrast.
             3.5.2.8.3. Reduced font size of half the font size described in chapter 3.5.2.6. can
             be implemented if the available space on the wall is limited.
             3.5.2.8.4. Military Family Housing (MFH) Building Number can be implemented
             follow specific layouts to stay in line with the architectural style chosen for a
             given housing area.
SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1005 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                          13


       3.5.3. Military Facility Identification Sign.
          3.5.3.1. General description. A modified version of the Military Facility
          Identification Sign B-3 will be utilized as a free-standing sign on all occupied military
          facilities and can also be utilized for community/ nonmilitary facilities. Signs will be
          limited to one per facility.
          3.5.3.2. Placement. The B-3 sign will be installed along and perpendicular to the
          roadway nearest the facility front entrance. If the facility main entrance is not visible
          from the primary access road then the sign will be installed where it will be seen from
          the road. Signs should be placed far enough from the edge of the roadway to
          minimize traffic hazards but close enough to be clearly visible to the user. Check
          sight lines before signs are erected to ensure that traffic control devices, roadway
          entrances, and exits are not hidden.
          3.5.3.3. Material. The modified version of the Military Facility Identification Sign is
          completely enclosed in an aluminum frame (see Figure 9).

Figure 9. Modified B-3 Military Facility Identification Sign




          3.5.3.4. Information. The signs should carry one unit name and any secondary
          information required to identify the unit component. No unit mottos, names nor titles
          of individuals are permitted. Identification of key personnel (e.g. Commanders,
          Chiefs and First Sergeants…) is not permitted. B-3 signs will have words spelled out
          whenever possible and avoid acronyms and abbreviations. For example, use “Civil
          Engineer Squadron” instead of “CES”. Wording on signs should be kept to a
          minimum and preferably under four words. For “52” type organizations don’t write
          the “52d” in front of the organization name (e.g. use “Civil Engineer Squadron”
          instead of “52d Civil Engineer Squadron”).
          3.5.3.5. Color. White lettering with standard brown background will be used.

              3.5.3.8.6. Variations. Some areas are not attached to particular buildings but still
              require a means of identification (e.g. SABER driving course area, Long Term
              Parking, etc., see Figure. 12). These signs will conform to the military facility
              sign standard, but with no facility identification number.
SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1005 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                        15

      3.5.4. Community Facility Identification Signs.
          3.5.4.1. Community Facility Identification signs can be used in place of the Military
          Facility Identification signs to identify activities and facilities used for community,
          recreational, and other non-military purposes.
          3.5.4.2. Independent organizations such as the Credit Union, the Post Office and the
          Red Cross may display their own symbols. These activities are permitted to use the
          standard image sign and symbols appropriate to their function which provide an
          attractive, identifiable image and/or wording that is easily recognizable to potential
          users as long as they are set in a framework that is consistent with the installation’s
          architectural guidelines. The signs should be tastefully done and complement the
          architectural character of the installation.
          3.5.4.3. DeCA facilities will display their standard image sign as approved by their
          Commissary Operating Board, the Major Command (MAJCOM), the BCE, and the
          52 FW Commander 52 FW/CC.
          3.5.4.4. Signs should be backlit by exception only. Each backlit sign (see example
          shown in Figure. 13) must be individually approved by the BCE or designated
          representative. Currently only the Service Credit Union, Community Bank, Non-
          Appropriated Funds and AAFES facilities are authorized to utilize backlit signs.

      3.5.5. Facility Entrance Sign
          3.5.5.1. General description. Some buildings have more than one primary entrance,
          requiring specific signage to identify the appropriate functions located at each
          entrance. A modified Type B4, expanded layout Building Entry sign will be used to
          identify organizations that are reached through the alternate entries of this type of
          building.    These organizations are usually squadron level units, squadron
          components, or their equivalents.

         3.7.2.1. Reserved Parking Signs.
             3.7.2.1.1. General description. Authorized permanent reserved parking spaces
             are shown at attachment 2. All submitted AF Form 332 requesting additional or
             modification of reserved parking signs shall attach a drawing of the existing
             parking area that notes the total number of parking spaces and shows a fixed point
             of reference (building, street intersection, etc.), as well as the already existing
             reserved parking spaces. Any reserved parking additions to the list at attachment
             2 must be coordinated through 52 SFS (based on SABI 31-204) and approved by
             the base TSWG.
             3.7.2.1.2. Placement.
                3.7.2.1.2.1. Reserved Parking Signs should be curb-mounted whenever
                possible, attached directly to the curb or on a parking bumper (Figure 19).

Figure 19. Curb and Bumper Block Mounted Reserved Parking Sign
SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1005 23 DECEMBER 2011                                                     21


                3.7.2.1.2.2. Reserved Parking Signs may be wall-mounted if the parking stall
                is close enough to an existing wall to permit clear identification and only if
                curb/ bumper block marking is not possible. As a general rule, buildings more
                than 10 feet from the vehicle bumper are too far. The background border
                should always be square with rounded corners as indicated. A modified
                Parking Regulation Sign type E2, panel A will be used (Figure 21).
                3.7.2.1.2.3. If curb, bumper block and building mounting are not possible,
                post mounted signs (Figure 20) of a low profile may be used. Post mounted
                sign installation is highly discouraged due to maintainability. The background
                border should always be square with rounded corners as indicated. A modified
                Parking Regulation Sign type E2, panel A will be used with sharp angles.

     3.7.5. Traffic Control Signs and Markings.
        3.7.5.1. General description. Traffic Control Signs and Markings regulate vehicular
        traffic on base. In order to familiarize the US personnel for off-base HN traffic
        control signs, SAB will adhere to German Traffic Control regulation
        (Verwaltungsvorschrift zur Straßenverkehrsordnung) to the extent provided on all
        regulatory traffic signs and markings. This includes the permanent and temporary
        signs used during road construction or repair. Only exceptions will be Directional
        Signs that will not follow the German standard, but will follow the standard described
        on chapter 3.4.
        3.7.5.2. Placement. If two signs are installed on a post, the bottom sign must be 6
        feet from the ground. If only one sign is installed, it must be seven feet from the
        ground. The top of the sign post will be even with the top of the topmost sign.
        3.7.5.3. Information. See attachment 3 for a list of the most used sign and marking
        samples on SAB. Auxiliary traffic signs (“Zusatzschilder”) are intended to provide
        some additional guidance or restriction to a traffic sign. Use auxiliary traffic signs
        with only symbols instead of text guidance wherever possible. Use the German
        standard auxiliary sign wherever possible. Replace German words by their English
        language translation.
        3.7.5.4. Color. Refer to the German traffic control regulation for color.
        3.7.5.5. Layout.   Refer to the German traffic control regulation for layout, see
        attachment 3.
        3.7.5.6. Dimensions Sizes of Traffic Control Signs and is summarized as in Table 2.
        Under the assumption that all speed limitations on SAB are below or equal 70 kph,
        Traffic Control Signs dimensions will be equal to the mid-size (100% size) requested
        by the German traffic control regulation on mid-range speed roads. Refer to the
        German traffic control regulation for special shaped signs. Even if discouraged, in
        case the available space or obstruction is a concern, reduced sized sign can be
        implemented on road with low speed limit if implemented IAW German traffic
        control regulation.

          base. They are an effective way to welcome distinguished visitors and to announce
          coming events. Arrival points are vehicle entry gates and the flight line side of the
          base passenger terminal.
          3.8.1.2. Any existing service's marquee signs shall be grandfathered to their existing
          location and configuration. Replacement marquees will require approval by 52 CES
          prior to purchase or installation. Marquee signs for officer, enlisted, and collocated
          clubs are permitted. Requests for marquees at other services facilities require
          approval by 52 FW/CC prior to purchase or installation.
       3.8.2. Monument type signs can be used to identify selected high-use or special-interest
       facilities.
       3.8.3. All special signs will be approved, except where otherwise stated, by the BCE on a
       case-by-case basis.
   3.9. Temporary Signage.
       3.9.1. Occasionally it is necessary to utilize temporary signs for irregular events (e.g.
       special base-wide events, yard sales, and authorized fund raising events).
       3.9.2. Temporary signs must be purchased by the using organization and prior approval
       must be obtained via an AF Form 332 to 52 CES Customer Service no later than 15
       working days prior to proposed first display date. A limited amount of sandwich boards
       to post these signs are available for check out at the 52 CES Self Help Store. If additional
       signs/ boards are required then the cost for producing/ purchasing will be the
       responsibility of the requesting unit.

       3.9.3. A limited amount of Temporary Reserved Parking signs are also available at the
       52 CES Self Help Store. They are generic in nature and will not include any names or
       office symbols. Requests must be submitted to 52 CES Customer Service no less than 14
       days prior to display. If supply exceeds demands, the cost for producing the signs will be
       the responsibility of the requesting unit.
       3.9.4. Temporary signs can be displayed for no more than seven days prior to the event
       and must be removed by the requestor within 24 hours after the event. Temporary Signs
       cannot be displayed for more than 3 consecutive weeks.
       3.9.5. Banners are considered temporary signage and subject to the same rules except
       that they can be displayed for a short period of time not to exceed 7 days. Furthermore
       the maximum number of banners authorized for any given facility is two and the
       maximum size of a banner will be 8 ft long and 2 ft high.
       3.9.6. Temporary Sign installation shall not modify nor damage any base infrastructure
       and shall not impede any operation of technical systems or equipment.
       3.9.7. Temporary Signs will produce as low Visual clutter as possible, have a
       professional appearance, and be compatible with safety and Anti-Terrorism/Force
       Protection security requirements.
4. Facility Interior Signs.
   4.1. Interior signs should complement interior architecture and color schemes if at all
   possible. Since buildings vary significantly, interior signs will also vary.
   4.2. All interior signs shall be designed so that they require the minimum possible
   maintenance. The sign system should be flexible enough to adapt to frequent personnel
   changes and office relocations and designed to guide visitors through a building from the
   entrance point to the correct floor, the correct area of a floor, the correct office and (if
   appropriate) the correct desk.
   4.3. Facility users are responsible for interior signage. Commercial systems should be
   utilized if available. Colors should coordinate with the building interior design scheme.
   4.4. Signs should use the dimensions shown in UFC 3.120-01 as a guideline. The color
   scheme will match and/or compliment that of the interior scheme of the building.
