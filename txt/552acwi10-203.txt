notify all applicable BS members IAW ACWI 10-202, Line 5 and Line 6 recalls, when the BS is
activated.
5. Battle Staff Locations. The primary location for 552 ACW BS operations is HQ 552d Air
Control Wing, Building 280, Battle Cab. The alternate location is Building 989, Room 95, which
is located on the second floor.
6. Training Requirements: 552 ACW/XP has overall responsibility for establishing and
conducting training for the SBS Cell, SC and BDs. 552 ACW/XP will ensure BS procedures, BS
organization, BS member responsibilities and facilities are included in annual and semi-annual
training. Each commander will ensure his/her representatives receive BS training. All 552 ACW
Group Commanders will develop specific functional cell training programs that fit their needs.
   6.1. General training of 552 ACW SBS Cell, SC and BD personnel consists of two
   programs: initial and recurring training.
       6.1.1. Initial Training (IT). IT consists of an orientation to BS operations and must be
       completed prior to performing duty as a BS member. IT training will cover, at a
       minimum:
 12                                                        552ACWI10-203 24 AUGUST 2011

          6.1.1.8. Briefing and report requirements and construction.
       6.1.2. Recurring Training (RT). RT is conducted for SBS Cell, SC and BD members
                semi-annually and focuses on new BS procedures, lessons learned from exercises
       or real- world events and review of current procedures. Participation in wing exercises
       will satisfy recurring training needs if they cover the RT objectives. SC and BD
       members will receive recurring training.
          6.1.2.1. Functional Cell Training. All organizations responsible for providing
          designated BS representatives will conduct their own unit-level training in specific
          unit actions or tasks to support contingency operations.
          6.1.2.2. Documentation. ACW/XPX will document SBS Cell and SC IT and RT.
          Unit-level training is at unit discretion, and will be documented by the unit. Retain
          documentation will be retained for one year or when the individual is no longer
          performing BS duties.

552ACWI10-203 24 AUGUST 2011                                                                 13


impacts, develop courses of action, and respond to or recover from a given situation. Develop
BS checklists from approved functional and operations plans, instructions, or other directives.
   8.1. Checklist Markings. Members should not proceed from one checklist step to the next
   without appropriately marking each step. To aid in situational awareness and crew position
   changeovers, BS members will use the following standard markings:
       8.1.1. A ―T‖ indicates the step was accomplished.
       8.1.2. An ―O‖ indicates the step was noted or initiated open but not completed. All steps
       must be accomplished before the checklist is considered complete.
       8.1.3. An ―N‖ indicates the step is not applicable/not required.
       8.1.4. A ―P‖ indicates a checklist step was previously accomplished.
       8.1.5. An ―S‖ indicates that the checklist step is to be simulated.
9. Operations Security (OPSEC). BS members will:
   9.1. Be aware of the adversarial threat to 552 ACW systems, mission, and personnel.
   9.2. Receive a local threat assessment by the wing Antiterrorism Officer (ATO)/Intel
   Officer.
   9.3. Practice the ―need-to-know‖ principle when discussing sensitive unclassified
   information over non-secure lines. Dispose of classified and sensitive unclassified material
   properly when no longer needed.
   9.4. Reduce indicators that could reveal the nature of BS operations.
   9.5. Use door locks and sound masking to provide security for and awareness of classified
   briefings or group discussions taking place inside the BS facility.
   9.6. Be familiar with CCIs.
   9.7. Verify and cross-check classification of all BS information.
   9.8. Never discuss or talk around classified information on any non-secure telephone.
   9.9. Ensure all two-way communication devices (cell phones, Balckberries, etc) are secured
   in the main facility corridor of either the CP or the alternate CP prior to entering any BS
   areas.
   9.10. State to all in the vicinity ―Open Line‖ if making or answering a non-secure call to
   prevent an OPSEC/COMSEC violation. Once the non-secure call is complete, advise all in
   the vicinity of a ―Closed Line.‖ Personnel will not open a non-secure line when a secure call
   or discussion is in progress.
   9.11. Inform all personnel ―Secure Up‖ when making a secure call. Members with a non-
   secure line open should end their discussion immediately to prevent an OPSEC/COMSEC
   violation. Advise all ―Secure Down‖ once the secure call is complete. Members are clear to
   open a non-secure line when the secure line is down.
10. Battle Staff Briefing. BS briefings inform members of tasking, current situation and status
and limitations affecting task accomplishment. There are two (2) standard briefings conducted
 14                                                        552ACWI10-203 24 AUGUST 2011


within the BS: the Initial Assessment Briefing and the Execution Plan Briefing. In addition, the
BS will conduct Situation Update Briefings as required.
   10.1. The Initial Assessment Briefing will provide a summary of the situation that caused
   activation, including known information, potential courses of action and response
   requirements or capabilities. For deployments, the meeting will normally occur at RST +
   1:30, and should last no longer than 15 minutes to allow Group CCs time to prepare for the
   Execution Plan Briefing which will normally occur at RST + 4:00. For all other situations,
   initial assessment briefing will occur no later than 15 minutes after notification during duty
   hours or no later than one hour during off-duty hours. For all other situations, initial
   assessment briefing will occur no later than 15 minutes after notification during duty hours or
   no later than on hour during off-duty hours.
   10.2. Situation Update Briefings will take place at regular intervals as part of the BS battle
   rhythm or as directed by BS/CC. These briefings provide the BS with as much information as
   possible concerning the wing's taskings. If an OPLAN has not been tasked, the Situation
   Update briefing will list the UTCs tasked. Tailor the Execution Plan Briefing, as well as
   follow-on Situation Update Briefings, to ensure only critical items are briefed. They will
   generally have the following format:

Terms
Battle Staff—Staff formed by the commander to plan, direct and coordinate forces in response
to contingency and crisis situations. This includes developing courses of action and executing
commander and HHQ directives. In 552 ACW, the wing Battle Staff is divided into four cells:
Senior Battle Staff, Synergy, Functional, and Advisory.
Advisory Cell—This Battle Staff cell is composed of personnel that are not sitting members on
the BS, but are present when necessary to receive or provide briefings and updates. Otherwise,
these personnel operate out of their daily work areas.
Cell Directors—Cell Directors provide coordinated guidance and direction to respective wing
units through functional cells. These personnel are the Operations Cell Director, the Maintenance
Cell Director, and the Air Control Cell Director.
Senior Battle Staff Cell—This Battle Staff cell provides overall command of and direction to
the Battle Staff functional cells regarding wing mission execution. The Senior Battle Staff Cell
consists of the Wing Commander and Vice Commander, Operations Group Commander,
Maintenance Group Commander, Air Control Group Commander, and Battle Director.
Synergy Cell—This Battle Staff cell consolidates inputs from other Battle Staff cells and
compiles them into an overview of wing status and capability for the Senior Battle Staff Cell.
Readiness Condition—Commonly called LERTCONs, the seven (7) Readiness Conditions are
divided into five (5) Defense Conditions (DEFCONs) and two (2) Emergency Conditions
(EMERGCONs).
Significant Event— An event that will affect or has affected the status or capability of a 552
ACW unit, and must be reacted to by the wing Battle Staff or Installation Control Center.
