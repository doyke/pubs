                          A BRIEF HISTORY
The USAF Honor Guard traces its beginning to May 1948 when Headquarters Command USAF
was instructed to develop plans for an elite ceremonial unit comparable to those of the other
armed services. As a result, a ceremonial unit was activated within the Air Police Squadron in
September 1948 with an authorized strength of 98 enlisted and two officers. However, due to
transfers and personnel attrition, the end of the year found the ceremonial detachment, for all
practical purposes, disbanded. It wasn’t until March 1949 that sufficient personnel were
assigned to enable the unit to function.

The Ceremonial Detachment continued to be assigned to the Air Police Squadron until
December 1971. Finally, on 1 January 1972, the Honor Guard became its own, as a separate
unit.

Kunsan AFB Honor Guard is comprised of volunteers who are carefully screened for their ability
and physical dexterity. Only those who are highly motivated and maintain an exceptionally high
standard of appearance, conduct and aptitude for ceremonial duty are considered.

                                         OUR MISSION


The mission of the Kunsan AB Honor Guard is to “Represent every member, past and present, of
the United States Air Force…” We accomplish our mission by selecting only the sharpest and
most dedicated individuals for our team. Once these members are fully trained, they represent
Kunsan and the Air Force at base wide details, community events, cordons for distinguished
guests and many other details.


MEMBERS MISSION

As a member certain things are expected of you. You are now in a highly visible position and
therefore held to higher standards. “My standards of conduct and level of professionalism must
be above reproach, for I represent all others in my service.” These standards include dress and
appearance, self-discipline, military bearing, professional behavior and overall performance.
You will be called upon to perform details during both duty and off duty hours, as well as some
weekend and holiday details. Mandatory weekly practices are held in order to prepare you to
perform all details.

NOTE: Practices are held each Tuesday from 1230-1500 at the Base Theater, unless otherwise
noted.


BENEFITS

Membership on the Honor Guard does provide many benefits. There are no words to explain
that feeling you get the first time you perfect your evaluation sequence, or the sense of pride that
comes from doing your first funeral. Not only will being a member fill you with an increased
sense of pride and dedication, it will be one of the most satisfying experiences of your life. The
Honor Guard will also help put you on a career path that will always keep you one step ahead of
your fellow Air Force members by enhancing your level of professionalism and leadership skills.
The Kunsan Honor Guard also has a great incentive plan that will only continue to get better.

                      Consideration for the Air Force Achievement Medal

Honor Guard members that demonstrate outstanding service to the Kunsan AB Honor Guard
program will be considered for the Air Force Achievement Medal. Members must, but not
limited to, complete a minimum of 15 details and attend a minimum of three (3) practices a
month to be considered. Other considerations, such as professional, military bearing and
participations, will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Members who extend at Kunsan and
fulfill another Honor Guard contract must meet the same requirements.

                                            Awards

Wing quarterly, annual and Honor Guardsman of the Month awards are based on a points
system. The points system is based on participation/involvement as Honor Guard members.

                             Base Honor Guard Charge
Handpicked to serve as a member of the Kunsan Air Base Honor Guard, my standards of
conduct and level of professionalism must be above reproach, for I represent all others in my
service.

Others earned the right for me to wear the ceremonial uniform, one that is honored in rich
tradition and history. I will honor their memory by wearing it properly and proudly.

Never will I allow my performance to be dictated by the type of ceremony, severity of the
temperature or size of the crowd. I will remain superbly conditioned to perfect all movement
throughout every drill and ceremony.

Obligated by my oath I am constantly driven to excel by a deep devotion to duty and a strong
sense of dedication.

Representing every member, past and present, of the United States Air Force, I vow to stand
sharp, crisp and motionless, for I am a ceremonial guardsman.
