                                            Chapter 1

         CHARACTERIZATION UNIT (CU) AND EXPLOITATION UNIT (EU)
                           INTERACTIONS

1.1. General. The 26th Operational Weather Squadron (26 OWS) and the 72d Operations
Support Squadron Weather Flight (72 OSS/OSW) are the official weather information agencies
for Tinker AFB Air Force Base, Oklahoma. These agencies provide weather information in
support of the 72d Air Base Wing (72 ABW), Oklahoma City-Air Logistics Complex (OC-
ALC), the 552d Air Control Wing (552 ACW), the 507th Air Refueling Wing (507 ARW) and
STRATCOMMWING ONE (SCW-1) (USN). The 72 OSS/OSW is commonly referred to as
the Weather Flight (WF) and is the focal point for all weather-related issues. This instruction
will be reviewed and revised no greater than biennially or IAW with host/parent unit procedures
if the time is less than biennially.
   1.1.1. The 26 OWS is considered the characterization unit. Characterization encompasses
   the “collect, analyze and predict” weather core competencies. Characterization depends on
   Air Force Weather’s ability to collect accurate data, correctly analyze that data, and use the
   results to produce a coherent picture of the present and future state of the air and space
   environment.
   1.1.2. 72 OSS/OSW is considered an exploitation unit. Exploitation is the ability to
   minimize the impact of environmental threats to friendly forces while simultaneously
   capitalizing on environmental conditions that maximize the operational advantage over
   enemy forces. Exploitation units tailor the characterization provided by the characterization
   unit. Tailoring is the extraction of data that is pertinent to a specific mission profile from the
   overall characterization of the air and space environment. Tailoring does not mean changing
   the characterization. To the greatest extent possible exploitation units will use the
   characterized data provided to them.
1.2. Concept of Operations.
   1.2.1. The 26 OWS at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, provides regional and operational-level
   weather products and information to Air Force and Army units in the south-central and
   southeastern regions of the Continental United States (CONUS).
   1.2.2. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). The 26 OWS performs a continuous
   METWATCH for Tinker AFB. METWATCH is a deliberate, continuous process for
   monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment in an area or region. The purpose of
   a METWATCH is to identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge
   from forecast conditions, determine courses of action to update or amend a forecast product
   or group of products, and notify designated agencies.
   1.2.3. The WF is the primary source of tailored weather services in support of the 72 ABW,
   the AFSC/AFMC, the 552 ACW, the 507 ARW, various headquarters elements, and visiting
   aircrews. The WF provides only resource protection (RP) and local area missions to
   STRATCOMMWING ONE (SCW-1) (USN) (see 3.3.1.3). The WF will make every effort to
   ensure that mission-limiting weather is anticipated and exploited, and that safety and RP are
   maintained.

1.3. Responsibilities.
     1.3.1. General responsibilities of the 26 OWS and WF are outlined in AFI 15-128, para 4.1
     and para 6.1, respectively.
        1.3.1.1. The 26 OWS issues the Tinker AFB Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs),
        forecast weather warnings and watches, and may provide flight weather briefings to
        transient aircrews passing through Tinker AFB. The OWS will issue observed warnings
        and advisories when the WF is closed.
        1.3.1.2. The WF issues all observed advisories and warnings when the WF is open.
        1.3.1.3. The WF will create Mission Weather Products (MWPs) that fuse theater scale
        products with local mission requirements to enable the direct inject of weather impacts
        into warfighter planning and/or execution. MWPs are known locally the Mission
        Execution Forecasts (MEFs), Planners, verbal briefings, and 175-1s. The WF will also
        provide flight weather briefings for transient aircrews IAW the WF duty priorities listed
        in Table 1.1
     1.3.2. Tinker AFB Installation Data Page. The 26 OWS and Tinker WF will coordinate
     and maintain a Tinker AFB Installation Data Page detailing TAF specification and
     amendment criteria, WWA thresholds, desired lead times, mission impacts, unit information,
     Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) back-up contacts and local outage back-up information.
     1.3.3. Eyes Forward and Collaboration. The Tinker WF will act as the eyes forward for
     the OWS by relaying significant, time-sensitive meteorological information not found in
     coded meteorological reports to the 26 OWS to assist in forecast operations.
1.4. Duty Priorities. 72 OSS/OSW Duty Priorities. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, para 1.3.3.1, the
WF has created the following duty priorities based on mandated weather instruction.
TINKERAFBI 15-101 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                           7

1.6. Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). Continuity of support to the installation is
susceptible to communication outages at the 26 OWS and WF.
     1.6.1. WF COOP and WF Alternate Operating Location (AOL). In the event of a
     building evacuation, the WF will move to building 1027, Comm (405) 734-3529 / DSN 884-
     3529. WF members will follow duty-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) and
     evacuation checklists (including a list of required back-up equipment) and resume services at
     the AOL as soon as possible. The flight will continue operational 72 ABW support and
     resume eyes forward responsibilities for the OWS. If access to observing sensing equipment
     readouts is lost, a Kestrel will be used to take observations and to back-up/augment the
     AN/FMQ-19 (Automated Meteorological Observing System). Most WF services/support
     will be provided, but will require a case-by-case assessment depending on communication
     line status, equipment status, etc. Expect most services to be somewhat degraded (weather
     products, pilot briefings, etc.) due to limited facilities and loss of dedicated data services,
     including sensors and various data types (meteorological satellite (METSAT), radar imagery,
     etc.). For flight safety reasons, the WF will not evacuate during exercises. However, the WF
     will perform an AOL evacuation annually to maintain certification. See Attachment 12 for
     location of primary and alternate operating locations.
     1.6.1.1. If the 72 OSS/OSW experiences a full communication/electrical outages (network,
     phone, cell phone, power), the 26 OWS will take full responsibility for all weather watches,
     warnings, and advisories, TAFs, and flight weather briefings until outages can be corrected
     or overcome. Note that "eyes forward" capabilities may be delayed or omitted based on the
     situation. Further support, if needed, will be decided upon cooperatively by the 72
     OSS/OSW flight leadership and 26 OWS leadership.
     1.6.2. 26 OWS COOP.
        1.6.2.1. For short term outages (up to 72 hours), the WF will assume local TAF and
        weather watch, warning and advisory responsibility.
        1.6.2.2. For long-term outages (greater than 72 hours), the 26 OWS’ plan is to resume all
        support from an alternate location.
        1.6.2.3. Exercises. In coordination with WFs, 26 OWS conducts monthly COOP
        exercises.

                                   AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions affecting the Tinker AFB aerodrome
(defined as 5NM ring from the center of the airfield) or the installation as a whole.
2.2. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-111,
Surface Weather Observations, utilizing the AN/FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Observing
System (AMOS). Most observations are taken automatically by the AN/FMQ-19 with no human
intervention. At times, it is necessary for a weather forecaster to augment the system.
Automated and augmentation processes are outlined in para 2.2.7 The following observations
are created and disseminated:
   2.2.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). METARs are disseminated both
   locally and longline between 55 and 59 minutes after the hour.
   2.2.2. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI). SPECI is an unscheduled
   observation completed and transmitted when any of the Tinker AFB special criteria listed in
   Attachment 3 have been observed or sensed. SPECI will contain all data elements found in
   a METAR plus additional remarks that elaborates on data in the body of the report. All
   SPECI reports will be prepared and transmitted as soon as possible after the relevant criteria
   are observed. Attachment 5 contains an example SPECI weather observation.
   2.2.3. Aviation Selected Local Weather Report (LOCAL). During augmentation, the WF
   will take single element LOCAL observations for altimeter setting changes. These will be
   transmitted to Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel via phone to the Tower at 30 minutes
   past the hour and/or when the altimeter setting has changed 0.01 inch Hg since the last report,
   whichever is soonest. LOCAL observations can also be sent on request. LOCAL
   observations are documented on a local electronic form.
   2.2.4. Official Observing Points. The official observing point is the location of the FMQ-
   19 sensors (See Attachment 11). During periods of augmentation, the observation point will
   be approximately 125 feet away from the southeast side of building 240. Due to the lack of
   visibility points at building 240, a secondary observation point is approximately 125 feet
   away from the northwest side of the building. During relocations to the AOL, and
   augmentation is required, the observation point is approximately 125 feet away from the
   north side of building 1027. Due to the lack of visibility points at building 1027, a secondary
   observation point is approximately 125 feet away from the south side of the building.
   2.2.5. Observing Point Limitations.
      2.2.5.1. The FMQ-19 is properly sited and no limitations are currently noted.
      2.2.5.2. Augmented observations taken at the primary augmentation site (Bldg. 240) are
      degraded because the observer’s view to the north through west is blocked by the
      building and thunder may not be heard due to airfield noise. Augmented observations
      require the weather technician to traverse to the opposite side of the building to get a
      complete view.
 10                                              TINKERAFBI 15-101 6 DECEMBER 2013


       2.2.5.3. Augmented observations taken at the AOL are degraded because the view is
       blocked to the south by building 1027 and thunder may not be heard due to flightline
       noise. Augmented observation requires the weather technician to traverse to the opposite
       side of the building to get a complete view.
   2.2.6. Automated FMQ-19 Observation. An automated observation is any observation
   having been evaluated, prepared, and transmitted by an observing system without human
   intervention. In automated mode, the FMQ-19 observing system will record and disseminate
   weather observations. The FMQ-19 uses time averaging of sensor data. In an automated
   observation, sky condition will be an evaluation of sensor data gathered during the 30-minute
   period ending at the actual time of the observation. All other elements evaluated are based
   on sensor data that is within 10 minutes or less of the actual time of the observation.
   2.2.7. Forecaster FMQ-19 Augmentation. Augmentation is the process of having a
   certified weather forecaster manually add or edit data to an observation generated by the
   FMQ-19. WF personnel do not augment the FMQ-19 when the airfield is closed except
   when tornadic activity is occurring or forecast to occur. The two augmentation processes
   used are supplementing and back up.
       2.2.7.1. Supplementing (definition). Manually adding meteorological information to an
       observation generated by the FMQ-19 that is beyond that system’s capability to measure
       and report. For example, the sensor cannot sense a tornado or hail.
       2.2.7.2. Supplementing procedures. WF personnel will supplement observations when
       the airfield is open and the weather conditions in Table 2.1 are observed. WF personnel
       will be ready to supplement observations if the conditions in Table 2.1 are forecast to
       occur within 2 hours. Weather personnel are required to log on to an AMOS and be
       prepared to supplement whenever a watch or warning has been issued for tornadic
       activity.

TINKERAFBI 15-101 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                            11


       2.2.7.3. Back-up (definition). The process of providing meteorological data and/or
       dissemination of an FMQ-19 generated observation when the primary automated method
       is not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure.
       2.2.7.4. Back-up procedures. In the event of FMQ-19 malfunction or failure, back-up
       procedures will be implemented only during airfield operating hours. They will also be
       provided when tornadic activity is occurring or forecast to occur. WF personnel will use
       alternate observing procedures when performing back-up operations. A Kestrel will be
       used to take observations while performing back-up procedures. When required, the WF
       will encode and disseminate METAR and SPECI observations IAW AFMAN 15-111
       Table 3.2. All element entries must be observed within 15 minutes of the actual time of
       the observation with the exception of wind gusts and squalls, which are reported only if
       they are observed within 10 minutes of the time of the observation. When utilizing back-
       up equipment, all wind and pressure values will be estimated.
2.3. TAF Support. Tinker AFB TAFs are produced and disseminated by the 26 OWS IAW
AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-124, AFMAN 15-129V1, and the Tinker AFB Installation Data Page.
Attachment 4 lists forecast specification and amendment criteria. TAFs are valid for 30 hours,
apply to the area within the 5NM area of the Tinker AFB airfield complex TAFs are issued at
0200, 1000, and 1800 Zulu time during Local Standard Time and 0100, 0900, and 1700 during
Daylight Saving Time. Attachment 5 contains examples of typical Tinker AFB TAFs.
2.4. Resource Protection (RP) Support and Warnings, Watches and Advisories
(WWA). The 26 OWS conducts a continuous meteorological watch to identify and assess
emerging and imminent threats to Tinker AFB. Special Weather Statements (SWS) and Watches,
Warnings, and Advisories are special notices provided by the 26 OWS resulting from both the
forecast and METWATCH processes to assist military decision makers with resource and RP
decisions. Watches and warnings provide notice of weather events posing a hazard to life or
property. Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of environmental
phenomena with the potential to impact operations. Customer responses to WWAs are listed in
Attachment 6.
   2.4.1. SWS. SWSs are special notices issued by the 26 OWS to assist military decision
   makers with RP decisions.
   2.4.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice to installation
   personnel/supported units of a potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to
   pose a hazard to life or property. They are used by installation personnel/supported units to
   make force protection and risk management decisions. Watches are issued for a 5NM radius
   of the center point of the Tinker AFB runway complex and are defined in Table 2.2
 12                                             TINKERAFBI 15-101 6 DECEMBER 2013

   2.4.3. Weather Warnings. A special notice to notify installation personnel when an
   established weather condition of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property is
   occurring or is expected to occur. Weather warnings provide concise information outlining
   environmental threats and are used by commanders and personnel to make RP decisions and
   take protective action. Warnings are issued for a 5NM radius at the center point of the
   runway, unless otherwise specified, and are defined in Table 2.3
TINKERAFBI 15-101 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                           13

   2.4.4. Observed Weather Warnings. Lightning warnings are the only observed warning
   issued for Tinker AFB and extends 5 NM and/or 10 NM in all directions from the airfield.
   Lightning warnings are not issued until lightning is observed, either visually or via the
   National Lightning Detection Network. The lightning warning will remain valid until
   lightning is no longer observed within 5 NM and/or 10 NM for at least 15 minutes.
   Exception: A lightning warning will not be cancelled if a thunderstorm is within 5 NM
   and/or 10 NM(as indicated on radar).
   2.4.5. Weather Advisories. A weather advisory is a special product notifying an end user
   when an established environmental condition effecting operations is occurring or is expected
   to occur on Tinker AFB. Observed weather advisories will remain valid until the criteria is
   no longer occurring and has not occurred in the last 30 minutes. Tinker AFB advisories are
   defined in Table 2.4
 14                                               TINKERAFBI 15-101 6 DECEMBER 2013

Crosswinds > 35 knots                        Observed
Notes:
1. Crosswinds are calculated based on the maximum observed wind speed (to include gusts)
and worst case observed direction including variability.

   2.4.6. WWA Numbering Scheme. Advisories, watches, and warnings are numbered
   consecutively by identifying the type of weather message (watch, warning, or advisory)
   followed by a five-digit number. The first two numbers indicate the current month while the
   second three numbers indicate the sequence number. For example, the message “Weather
   Warning 02-005” means the month is February (02) and this is the fifth (005) warning issued
   in the month. The message “Weather Advisory 12-013” means the month is December (12)
   and this is the thirteenth (013) advisory issued in the month. Examples of different messages
   are contained in Attachment 5.
   2.4.7. WWA Upgrades/Downgrades. WWAs will be upgraded (i.e., winds increase from
   35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead
   times specified in Tables 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4. Only one warning will be in effect at a given time
   (and will include multiple warning criteria as required) except for forecast tornado warnings
   and/or observed lightning warnings. Tornado and lightning will be separate warnings. With
   the exception of tornado and lightning warnings, if a warning is issued for one criteria and it
   becomes necessary to warn for another criteria, a new warning and new number will be
   issued, to include all criteria expected. Separate valid times may be specified for each
   criterion, if necessary.
   2.4.8. WWA Amendments. When WWAs no longer adequately describe the phenomenon's
   expected occurrence, a completely new WWA with a new number will be issued. The
   amendment will clearly state how the amendment or extension affects any previously issued
   notices.
   2.4.9. WWA Extensions. WWAs may be extended provided the extension is issued prior to
   the expiration of the original notice.
   2.4.10. WWA Cancellation. Warnings and watches are canceled when the weather
   phenomena is no longer occurring or expected to occur. Warnings not extended or canceled
   will automatically expire at the end of the valid period. Observed warnings will be canceled
   when the criteria is no longer occurring and has not occurred in the last 15 minutes.
   Observed advisories will be canceled when the criteria is no longer occurring and has not
   occurred in the last 30 minutes.
TINKERAFBI 15-101 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                                15


2.5. Dissemination Process.
   2.5.1. Observations. Observations taken by either the FMQ-19 automated observing system
   or with back-up equipment are disseminated via JET. When JET is nonoperational, the WF
   will relay observations to the following local organizations in order of priority listed in Table
   2.5.
   2.5.2. TAFs. 26 OWS disseminates TAFs via JET. If JET is non-operational, the WF will
   disseminate TAFs to ATC, SOF, 10th FLTS, and SCW-1 via telephone, provided fax
   number, or provided e-mail. Table 2.5 shows the notification priority.
   2.5.3. SWSs. SWSs provide advance notice of widespread hazardous weather conditions
   that have the potential to affect Tinker AFB. 26 OWS posts SWSs to the 26 OWS
   webpage. The WF leadership will forward tailored information from the SWSs to Tinker
   AFB senior leadership, as requested.
   2.5.4. WWAs. The 26 OWS or WF will enter WWAs into JET which will disseminate the
   information to ATC, the SOF, 552 ACW/CP, 72 OSS/OSAM Airfield Management, 507
   ARW/CP, 10th Test Flight, and SCW-1. The WF contacts 552 ACW/CP and 72
   OSS/OSAM Airfield Management to verify receipt prior to their required dissemination
   procedures. If JET is out-of-service, the WF and/or the 26 OWS will make back-up calls.
   Refer to the pyramid notification scheme shown in Figure 2.1. In addition, the 552
   ACW/CP, disseminates all WWAs via e-mail, LMRs, and AtHoc.
      2.5.4.1. Lightning Warnings. All lightning warnings are disseminated by the 552
      ACW/CP to the base populace via e-mail, LMRs, and AtHoc.
      2.5.4.2. Tornado Warnings. The WF has the primary responsibility for sounding the
      base siren for a tornado warning issuance. In the event the WF system is malfunctioning,
      552 ACW/CP will sound the siren.

current observation. Although secondary to the function of air traffic control, the tower will
contact weather at a minimum whenever the following conditions occur:
   2.6.1. Tinker AFB Tower personnel will notify weather personnel when:
       2.6.1.1. Tower visibility is less than 4 statute miles and tower visibility changes by a
       reportable value (3, 2¾, 2½, 2¼, 2, 1¾, 1½, 1¼, 1, ¾ and ½ statute miles), or when tower
       visibility increases to 4 miles or more. However, this information is not included in
       observations produced by the FMQ-19.
       2.6.1.2. A thunderstorm is observed.
       2.6.1.3. Lightning is first observed.
       2.6.1.4. A tornado or funnel cloud is observed or disappears.
       2.6.1.5. Precipitation begins or ends.
       2.6.1.6. Any other meteorological situation exists that, in the opinion of the air traffic
       controller, is critical to safety of flight.
       2.6.1.7. Notify the weather technician of changes in the operational status of the High
       Intensity Runway Light (HIRL) system.
       2.6.1.8. Notify the weather technician of active runway changes and corresponding

       2.6.1.9. Respond to weather flight requests for radio checks of the Pilot-to-Metro Service
       (PMSV) frequency 261.025 MHz, and provide back-up, as able, when the PMSV is out
       of service. Back up will be provided when Tower workload permits or upon request (if
       Tower workload permits) if Weather flight knows a customer is trying to contact the
       forecaster.
       2.6.1.10. Obtain pilot weather reports (PIREPs) when conditions warrant, or upon
       request, and relay the reports to the weather flight within 5 minutes of receipt, unless
       higher priority duty exists.
       2.6.1.11. Provide indoctrination training for weather personnel, as requested.
       2.6.1.12. Give weather personnel sufficient time to switch over appropriate weather
       sensors if an observation on an inactive runway is required.
       2.6.1.13. Inform weather flight personnel of runway light setting changes during times
       when RVR observations are required.
   2.6.2. ATC Limited Observation Training. The 72 OSS/OSW oversees the Tinker AFB
   Limited Observation Training Program. ATC personnel requiring training should contact the
   WF NCOIC at DSN 884-5477/Commercial (405) 734-5477 to schedule an appointment. To
   satisfy Limited Observation Training requirements, personnel are required to receive an
   orientation of the weather facilities, attend a weather observer briefing, and be certified on
   observing procedures.
2.7. PMSV Support. Weather information is available via PMSV during duty hours on

      2.8.1.1. If the WF provided the MWP, the WF will notify the OWS Operations Floor
      Production Supervisor of all aircraft mishaps as soon as possible after notification of the
      event. The WF will coordinate with 26 OWS to save all applicable data and products. If
      products from other OWSs were used, the WF will coordinate with all applicable OWSs
      to ensure data is saved. Enough data covering weather conditions before and after the
      mishap will be saved to fully reconstruct environmental conditions.
      2.8.1.2. If an OWS or another WF provided the MWP, they will conduct the data save in
      coordination with any other Air Force Weather units involved.
   2.8.2. SWAP. The WF will initiate SWAP in accordance with criteria listed in table 2.6
   SWAP ensures sufficient manpower is available to meet the increased demand for timely
   weather information from its supported unit(s) during significant weather events. It is
   imperative that timely and accurate weather watches, warnings, and advisories are
   disseminated to all agencies to ensure personnel and RP. The WF will initiate a heightened
   METWATCH. The WF forecaster will notify the WF NCOIC of SWAP activation during
   normal staff duty hours. During non-duty hours, the 26 OWS will notify the WF standby
   forecaster when conditions listed in table 2.6 have been met and the WF technician will
   activate SWAP.

Table 2.6. Conditions Requiring SWAP Activation

                               SWAP ACTIVATION Criteria

                                   MISSION SERVICES

3.1. General. The WF and 26 OWS support the Tinker AFB flying and non-flying missions.
This chapter identifies the flying and non-flying missions and the weather support provided.
3.2. Flying Missions. The WF provides weather support to the flying units listed in
Attachment 7.
3.3. Mission Weather Product (MWP). MWPs fuse theater scale products with local mission
requirements enabling the direct inject of weather impacts into warfighter planning and/or
execution. The result is a product designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant
environmental information for planning and execution. The MWPs must be horizontally
consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by any OWS and Air Force Weather
Agency (AFWA).
   3.3.1. Flight Weather MWPs. The 72 OSS/OSW posts the Tinker AFB Mission Execution
   Forecast           to        the         WF           SharePoint          website       at
   (https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/72ABW/72OSS/OSW/default.aspx). This is the primary
   source to receive weather briefings for supported flying units on Tinker AFB. E-mailing of
   flying schedules to the WF organizational boxes (72OSS.OSW2@us.af.mil and
   72oss.osw.schedule@us.af.mil) is the primary source to receive requests from supported
   flying units. Requests, briefings, and updates can be obtained by calling the WF at DSN
   884-3196/3540 or at Commercial (405) 734-3196/3540. An example of the MWP can be
   found in Attachment 8.
       3.3.1.1. For missions that require more specialized support they will receive (i.e. Noble
       Eagle flights, deployment flights, etc.) an OC-ALC Mission Execution Forecast Form O-
       274. All other briefing requests that are not covered by the standard MEF or Form O-274
       will receive a standard 175-1. These requests can be made by e-mailing the requests to
       the WF organizational boxes or calling the WF (see contact information in 3.3.1.). To
       receive the briefing, the requestor will be required to indicate receipt preference and
       information or call the WF to obtain the briefing.
       3.3.1.2. Take Off and Landing Data (TOLD) Product. The TOLD is 24 hr tailored
       product used for planning purposes. The TOLD product is divided into one-hour blocks
       for the first 8 hours and two-hour blocks for the following 16 hours of expected
       conditions. The TOLD product is included on the MWP (see Attachment 8 for sample
       product). The TOLD product will be prepared by the WF daily and posted at
       https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/72ABW/72OSS/OSW/default.aspx.
       3.3.1.3. SCW-1 Navy Support. Local missions within the state of Oklahoma and Texas
       panhandle will be supported through the WFs MWPs. Missions outside this area will be
       handled through the Navy Weather Agency or equivalent. Applicable reciprocal support
       will be as outlined in 4.4.9
3.4. MISSIONWATCH. This is a deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial weather and/or
the space environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors.
TINKERAFBI 15-101 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                          21


   3.4.1. WF Briefed Missions. It is through MISSIONWATCH that MWP
   amendments/updates are accomplished. When potential hazards are identified, missions will
   be monitored continuously by the weather technician. The WF will utilize operational risk
   management processes during all stages of the forecast process. By utilizing proper ORM
   principles, technicians will remain situational aware of weather criteria or system outages
   that might require augmentation of the system to provide the most accurate weather data for
   safety of flight and ground personnel. During rapidly changing weather, the WF will inform
   the 26 OWS when weather products issued by the 26 OWS do not accurately reflect observed
   conditions and impact flight safety. The WF will amend/update the MWP as necessary. In
   addition, when previously not forecasted weather conditions develop that place a mission at
   risk, the WF will contact the associated wing agency with updates. These agencies will pass
   this information to the aircrews. See Table 3.1 for flying wings and associated agencies.
   MISSIONWATCH will be conducted and logged. NOTE: MISSIONWATCH is only
   conducted for missions that received weather briefings from 72 OSS/OSW.

                                          Chapter 5

                                 WEATHER EQUIPMENT

5.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on backup
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
5.2. Meteorological Equipment. The WF uses the FMQ-19, GR2Analyst/GR3 weather radar,
and Mark IVB meteorological satellite terminal to determine the current state of the atmosphere.
These critical systems provide customers the most timely, accurate, and relevant weather
intelligence possible.
   5.2.1. FMQ-19. The FMQ-19 samples, measures, and reports: temperature, wind speed and
   direction, visibility, cloud base height and amount of coverage, pressure, liquid equivalent
   precipitation accumulation, and ice accretion during freezing precipitation. These
   measurements are processed to create properly formatted, fully automated observations that
   comply with applicable various reporting standards and protocols defined in the Federal
   Meteorological Handbook (FMH-1), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Weather Service (NWS), and military
   reporting standards. See Attachment 12 for the Tinker Airfield sensor locations for the
   FMQ-19.
   5.2.2. GR2Analyst/GR3. The WF utilizes the GR2Analyst/GR3 as its primary source of
   radar data. Weather technicians make use of this software to analyze complex radar
   signatures, indicate lightning positions, and obtain detailed information on storm intensity,
   movement, internal circulation, and general wind flow. Weather technicians will routinely
   incorporate the latest radar information into all mission execution forecasts and RP products.
   5.2.3. Mark IVB. The Mark IVB is an Air Force meteorological satellite system that
   comprises a set of three weather satellites that receive data from polar orbiting and
   geostationary meteorological satellites. This unique meteorological analysis/forecasting tool
   is available to weather technicians to interrogate current weather via satellite and is
   especially useful in data sparse areas (lack of weather reporting stations).
5.3. Communications Equipment. The following systems are the backbone of the WF
communications network:
   5.3.1. JET. As discussed in para 2.5 of this instruction, JET is the primary system for
   disseminating forecast, observations, warnings, watches, and advisories. Telephones are used
   as a backup for key aircraft controlling agencies.
   5.3.2. PMSV Radio. The PMSV Radio (261.025 MHz) allows the WF to communicate
   with aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as tower personnel. If the PMSV is
   out-of- service, aircrews can contact Tinker AFB Tower at 124.45 or 251.05 MHz, 552 ACW
   CP at 141.65, 139.95, 305.6, or 225.875 MHz, or the 26 OWS via phone patch (where
   possible) to get weather data.
   5.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines serve primarily for rapidly passing along
   critical, time-sensitive information, as well as to serve for backup services.
 28                                             TINKERAFBI 15-101 6 DECEMBER 2013


   5.3.4. Local Area Network (LAN). The WF relies heavily on the LAN to improve the
   timeliness and accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers.
5.4. Maintenance.

Table 5.1. identifies which organizations provide preventive maintenance and repair
weather and communications equipment.

Table 5.1. Equipment Maintenance List
 Organization                                            Equipment
 72 OSS/ATCALS (Airfield Systems)                        FMQ-19, PMSV Radio
 AFWA Fielded Systems                                    JET, Mark IVB
 72 ABW/SCOII (Telephone Systems)                        Phones/Hotlines
 72 ABW/SCOOA (Network Maintenance)                      LAN/Internet Connectivity

   5.4.1. Restoral Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems exist in the event of
   natural disasters or any other anomaly, simultaneously impacting systems base wide.
   Significant indicates a situation where the equipment is completely inoperative, while
   minimal means the equipment is in limited operation. The priorities for weather equipment
   are listed in Table 5.2 below (priorities may be adjusted based on forecasted weather):

                                             feet or meters.
Present Weather                A4.8.         Any weather occurring at the observing location,
                                             obscurations to vision, or other phenomena.
Sky Condition                  A4.9.         State of the sky in terms of sky cover, layers and
                                             heights, ceilings and obscurations.
Temperature and Dew Point      A4.10.        Measure of hotness/coldness of ambient air. Dew
                                             point measures saturation point temperature.

                                             ground.
Remarks                        A4.12.        Remarks generally elaborate on parameters
                                             reported in the body of the report, and will be
                                             included in all METAR and SPECI observations.
A4.1. Type of Report. METAR or SPECI.
A4.2. Station identifier, also called the ICAO. This code identifies the location of the
observation (in this case Tinker AFB).
A4.3. Date and Time of Report. This is in Zulu (GMT) of the last element of the observation.
A4.4. Report Modifier. The report modifier can be either of the following two elements:
TINKERAFBI 15-101 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                           43


   A4.4.1. COR is entered into the report modifier group when a corrected METAR or SPECI
   is transmitted.
   A4.4.2. AUTO identifies the report as a fully automated report with no human intervention.
       A4.4.2.1. AUTO is automatically included in reports when the weather technician signs
       off the AMOS indicating the observations are no longer being augmented.
       A4.4.2.2. AUTO and COR will not be seen in the same observation. If the term COR is
       used, the observation cannot be reported as AUTO, since a weather technician is
       manually correcting the observation.
A4.5. Wind. The true direction the wind is blowing from is encoded in tens of degrees using
three figures. Directions less than 100 degrees are preceded with a "0." The wind speed is
entered as a two or three digit group immediately following the wind direction.
   A4.5.1. Gust. The wind gust is encoded in two or three digits immediately following the
   wind speed. The wind gust is encoded in whole knots using the units and tens digits and, if
   required, the hundreds digit.
   A4.5.2. Variable Wind Direction (speeds 6 knots or less). Variable wind direction with
   wind speed 6 knots or less may be encoded as VRB in place of the direction.
   A4.5.3. Variable Wind Direction (speeds greater than 6 knots). Wind direction varying
   60 degrees or more with wind speed greater than 6 knots will be encoded. The variable wind
   direction group will immediately follow the wind group. The directional variability will be
   encoded in a clockwise direction. For example, if the wind is variable from 180 degrees to
   240 degrees at 10 knots, it would be encoded 21010KT 180V240.
   A4.5.4. Calm Wind. Calm wind is encoded as 00000KT.
A4.6. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance (at least 50% of the aerodrome) seen from
the airfield reported in statute miles. The most common visibility reported is 7 miles.
A4.7. Runway Visual Range.
A4.8. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon occurring on the airfield. This is mandatory
anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. Table A4.3 lists the present weather codes:

   the fog can be seen.
   A4.9.7. FEW000, SCT000, BKN000, OVC000 – Surface-based obscuration which is
   clarified in the remarks. For example, fog obscuring 5/8 of the sky would be encoded
   BKN000 with a remark of FG BKN000.
   A4.9.8. Cloud Height. Three-digit number provides the height of the base of the cloud in
   hundreds of feet (e.g., 015 equals 1,500 feet). The CB and TCU descriptors may be
   appended to the cloud height to indicate the cloud is a cumulonimbus or towering cumulus.
A4.10. Temperature and Dew Point (i. e., can be in degrees, either Fahrenheit or Celsius.
A4.11. Altimeter Setting. The current value aircraft altimeters must be set at to read an
elevation of zero. The altimeter is measured in inches (INS) of mercury.
